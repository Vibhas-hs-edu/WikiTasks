William Greene (aviator)

William Greene (May 2, 1874 – August 28, 1952) was an early aviation pioneer who was one of the first American pilots and airplane constructor. He developed a passion for flying at an early age and was an active member and treasurer of the Aeronautical Society of New York. In 1909 he designed, constructed and piloted a biplane at the Morris Park Raceway, Bronx, NY. He later formed an aircraft manufacturing company in Rochester, NY
Early life.
Greene was born into a wealthy San Francisco family in 1872. His fascination with aviation began at twelve, when he performed his first experiment by jumping from the second storey of a building with an umbrella to slow his descent. After graduating from University with both a medical and dentistry degree, he traveled throughout Mexico and Central America to pursue his dream of flight. In 1902, he built and successfully flew a balloon in Chiapas, Mexico. Upon hearing of the Wright brothers' success, left Mexico for New York to further his exploration of aviation.
Aviation career.
In New York, Greene joined the Aeronautical Society of New York and, by 1909, he was their treasurer. Greene constructed his first aircraft in 1907, in which he made a series of short hops. In 1908 the Aeronautical Society began a two year rental agreement with the closed Morris Park Racetrack and invited the top aviators in the nation to come and experiment with aircraft. Greene set up shop at Morris Park and began work on his first truly successful airplane, which flew for the first time in 1909. Building on the success of this aircraft, in 1910 Greene established a small aircraft factory in Rochester, NY where he constructed and sold 4 more aircraft. While Greene was working on an aircraft to compete for the $10,000 prize offered by publisher Joseph Pulitzer for the first airplane to fly from Albany, NY to New York City, he learned that Glenn Curtiss was ready to attempt the flight and in a show of good sportsmanship, he traveled to Albany to be present and to hold the wing of Curtiss's aircraft for the takeoff. Due to financial difficulties, Greene closed his factory in 1911 and ended his aviation experiments.
In 1910, along with four other members of the Aeronautical Society of New York, set the New England ballooning record of 175 miles in 5 hours and 59 minutes.
Later life.
In 1911, he made his way north into Canada where he eventually settled in Hudson's Hope, BC with his wife Mary Evangeline Hilliard of Waterloo, Ontario. Hudson's Hope is where they had their only daughter, Ursula. Upon hearing of the United States' entry into World War I, Greene returned to America and joined the Army. Returning to Peace River, Alberta after the war, he opened a dental practice. He became an active member of the community. Fond of the theater and performance arts, he organized and directed several musicals in Peace River. He also had a horse drawn wagon that he would take around the region and perform magic shows with his daughter as the assistant.
An avid outdoorsman, he and fellow Peace River resident, Norman Soars, persuaded the government to create the Greene Valley Game Preserve
Greene died on August 28, 1952, in Edmonton, Alberta from a stroke.
The way his aviation career ended may have affected him because he rarely spoke of it in his later years. Residents of Peace River where surprised to learn of his prominent place in aviation.

Cumberland Central Business District

The Cumberland Central Business District is a commercial historic district in downtown Cumberland, Kentucky. While Cumberland was first settled in the 1820s, the district was developed during the area's coal mining boom of the 1910s and 1920s, which came after the Louisville and Nashville Railroad built lines through the region. Two of the largest mines in Harlan County, at Benham and Lynch, were near Cumberland; Benham and Lynch were company towns, however, which made Cumberland the closest commercial center independent of the mining companies. During this period, downtown Cumberland added a bank, a theater, a bus station, and many restaurants and specialty shops. The local coal industry declined dramatically during the Great Depression, and many of Cumberland's businesses closed as mining companies and their employees left the region.
The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 14, 1996.

Jinzhou Museum (Dalian)

The Jinzhou Museum () is a museum located in Jinzhou District, Dalian City, Liaoning Province, China. This museum and the Lüshun Museum are the two historically important museums in Dalian.
Background.
Jinzhou, surrounded by walls, was historically the central town of Liaodong Peninsula, while Lüshun and Dalian are relatively new towns, being developed in the latter half of the 19th century and the 20th century, respectively. Historically important artifacts are in the Jinzhou Museum and the Lüshun Museum.
The Old Museum.
The old Jinzhou Museum was established in 1928 during the time when Dalian, including Jinzhou, was Japan's leased territory, at the south gate of the walls (its current address: 61 Minzheng Street, 民主街61号) where there is now Xiangying Square (Chinese: 向应广场). It was part of the two-storeyed Jinzhou Town Hall.
In the museum was the model of the old walled town of Jinzhou. There were also the displays in Japanese of how the Japanese Army attacked and conquered Jinzhou in both Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars, before they marched on to Lüshun. These displays were changed to Chinese when the People's Republic of China was established in 1945.
The New Museum.
The new Museum was built in the northern suburbs (its address: 888 Yong-an Boulevard, 永安大街888号) and was gradually opened in about 2010. Its location is for the public buildings where there are also the new Children's Palace and the new Library are.
The new museum is four-storeyed: on the first (ground) floor are the model of the old walled town of Jinzhou and other displays; on the 2nd floor are the early historical displays, such as dolmens; on the 3rd floor are the displays of the events during the Ming and Qing periods, including the First Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War; and on the 4th floor are administrative offices.
Note: The Jinzhou Municipal Museum () is located in Jinzhou, Liaoning.
Jinzhou Futongweimen Museum.
The Jinzhou Fu-Tongweimen Museum (), located at 255 Minzhu Street, is the place where the governor who defended and governed the Jinzhou area was sent from the central government of China. It became the police department during both Japanese occupation and PRC. In 1999 it was converted to a historical museum.

Avlona railway station

Avlona railway station () is a station on the Piraeus–Platy railway line in Avlona, a settlement north of Athens urban area, in the northern part of the Athens urban area, in the municipality of Oropos, Greece. It was inaugurated on 8 March 1904. It is owned by OSE, but services are provided by TrainOSE, through Proastiakos from Athens to Chalcis. The station sits slightly above street level and can be accessed by either stairs or ramp.
History.
The Station opened on 8 March 1904, as Kakosalesi railway station (), in what was then the Central Greece on what was a branch line of the Piraeus, Demerli &amp; Frontiers Railway. The name reflected the older name for the area, the station's name was renamed to its current name on an unknown date. In 1920 the station and most of the standard gauge railways in Greece came under the control of the Hellenic State Railways (SEK). During the Axis occupation of Greece (1941-44), Athens was controlled by German military fourses, and the line used for the transport of troops and weapons. During the occupation (and especially during German withdrawal in 1944), the network was severely damaged by both the German army and Greek resistance groups. The track and rolling stock replacement took time following the civil war, with normal service levels resumed around 1948. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971 the station, and most of the Greek rail infrastructure was transferred to the "Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.", a state-owned corporation. In 1983 the station was rebuilt, reaping on 27 October of that year. The line was converted to diesel sometime before 1990. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. The station was reopened on 6 May 2005. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. That same year on 30 July Line 3 of Athens suburban railway began serving the station.
Facilities.
The ground-level station is assessed via stairs or a ramp. It has 2 side platforms, with the main station buildings located on the eastbound platform, however, due to state funding issues the booking office is closed, however, the waiting rooms are still open, with access to the platforms by stairs or lifts via a subway. The Station is housed in the original stone-built station (Now closed) There is no cafe on-site. At platform level, there are sheltered seating and Dot-matrix display departure and arrival screens and timetable poster boards on both platforms. There is no car park or bus connections at the station.
Service.
The station is served the following lines of the Athens Proastiakos or suburban railway:
Line 3 Athens - Chalcis with 1 tph. (transfer to Airport and Regional, Express &amp; InterCity services at SKA or non-airport services at Oinoi)

Christmas Rocks Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Willalooka about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about south of the town of Keith.
The conservation park consists of crown land in Section 16 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Willalooka. It came into existence on 30 January 2014 by proclamation under the state's "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". Its name is presumably derived from the geographical feature called "Christmas Rocks" which is located within its boundaries. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
The conservation park is located on the east side of the Riddoch Highway about north of the settlement of Willalooka. A visit to the conservation park is described by the Tatiara District Council as “a pleasant five minute walk” to the top of "Christmas Rocks" which is a hill composed of granite rocks which was part of an “archipelago” located in the “shallow sea” that covered what is now the Limestone Coast 25 million years before the present, for a view of the surrounding countryside.
Land within the conservation park's boundaries is known to be a site for "Prostanthera eurybioides" (Monarto Mintbush), a species of plant which is listed as "endangered" both by the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" and the Commonwealth "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999".
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Clarke's equation

In combustion, Clarke's equation is a third-order nonlinear partial differential equation, first derived by John Frederick Clarke in 1978. The equation describes the thermal explosion process, including both effects of constant-volume and constant-pressure processes, as well as the effects of adiabatic and isothermal sound speeds. The equation reads as
where formula_2 is the non-dimensional temperature perturbation and formula_3 is the specific heat ratio. The term formula_4 describes the explosion at constant pressure and the term formula_5 describes the explosion at constant volume. Similarly, the term formula_6 describes the wave propagation at adiabatic sound speed and the term formula_7 describes the wave propagation at isothermal sound speed. Molecular transports are neglected in the derivation.

Anatomy of Murder

Anatomy of Murder is a 2015 Australian whodunnit - video game and is the debut work of Darren McNamara's company DM Financial Services. According to McNamara, it is the first free-to-play online murder mystery game.
Production.
Conception.
The game was developed by DM Financial Services, a company focusing on producing original and engaging online gaming content. Led by online gaming entrepreneur Darren McNamara, "Anatomy of Murder" was the result of over 13 years of extensive R&amp;D. McNamara faced considerable resistance from the entertainment industry regarding the format, the production values, and for spending too much money. In addition, he received feedback from a network that they wanted to be involved in commissioning a series from the ground up rather than being shown a finished pilot they didn't order. He chose to go ahead and create the game because he felt it showed how much he believed in the concept more than a "4 page glossy". He originally received few knockbacks from TV executives In 2013, so he instead went outside the box and approached audiences directly. 
In October 2013, "TV Tonight" readers were asked to participate in an online focus group for the game, in order to provide McNamara with some feedback on his pitch. He was keen to see the concept being picked up in the Australian market before trying to sell it to the United States. In addition he hoped to take the format to MIPTV in April 2014. "Anatomy of Murder" was released two years later in 2015.
Design.
The game's narrative was conveyed through two produced episodes at 45 minutes each. A third episode was also produced which revealed the killer and the clues in detail. McNamara designed the format, produced the 3 episodes and built the website himself. Due to the lack of budget, McNamara was not able to improve the script, the production and the trailer to his standards. All of the information required to solve the murder was contained within those two episodes, as well as information at the game's website. A cash prize of AU$250,000 was made available to the first player able to solve the crime. The game could be played from phones, tablets or desktop computers. Players had to choose from nine possible killers and ten potential motives. According to McNamara, it is notable for being the first free-to-play online murder mystery game; he believes in the game's uniqueness as the format has been registered with FRAPA since 2007, and he has not come across any TV shows or DVD/Website/SMS games similar to "Anatomy of Murder." The prize amount was changed to $100,000 some time during its development. The winner was to be announced on Christmas Day 2016. A series of 20 clues were released onto the website leading up to that date.
Future.
As of April 2015, "Anatomy of Murder 2" is in the works. Then in October 2016, the sequel was set to start production in April 2017, with website members offered an audition. McNamara hoped to up the budget for this series in order to improve the quality. His goal was to produce between 2 and 3 series a year, with the story arcing across the whole season or between seasons. While only one person would win the major prize, there would be smaller additional prizes along the way.

Music video.
The music video was released on June 21, 2018. The video follows a puppet version of lead singer Brendon Urie on his journey to fame, occasionally cutting to the real Urie performing the song. After signing a contract with a manager, Brendon lives the glory of being famous. His manager then introduces him to drugs and he becomes addicted, sending his life into a tailspin to the point that he is robbed and beaten. In a bathroom mirror, puppet Urie encounters the real Brendon, who berates him. Puppet Brendon slowly recovers, dumping his drugs into the toilet and taking walks on the beach. The real Urie finishes the song, whereupon his audience is revealed to be puppets. A puppet version of Jimmy Fallon appears on stage and announces the release of "Pray for the Wicked", holding up what appears to be a vinyl of the album, referencing Panic! at the Disco's performance on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" in which they performed "Say Amen (Saturday Night)". The manager appears and throws puppet Brendon into a lifeless pile of other puppets.
The clip was named one of the top ten best alternative music videos of 2018 by iHeartRadio.
Reception.
"Billboard" described it as having "a vibrant energy" and "bright melodies". AllMusic described it as "sanguine club jam" and having "a strong hook".

The song was written and produced by Jake Sinclair and Jonas Jeberg, and co-written by Brendon Urie, Jenny Owen Youngs, Lauren Pritchard, Sam Hollander, William Lobban-Bean, Taylor Parks, and Ilsey Juber, with additional production by Jonny Coffer. It was serviced to alternative radio on July 31, 2018, and impacted hot adult contemporary radio on August 27, 2018, and US pop radio the following day. The music video was also released on August 27, 2018.

Background.
"High Hopes" was written and produced by Jake Sinclair and Jonas Jeberg, and co-written by Brendon Urie, Jenny Owen Youngs, Lauren Pritchard, Sam Hollander, William Lobban-Bean, Taylor Parks, and Ilsey Juber; with additional production by Jonny Coffer. Jeberg, Parks, Juber, and Lobban-Bean began writing the song at a BMI writing camp in Aspen, Colorado in 2015. When the four of them had arrived an hour early, they decided to go into a hot tub together outside. Jeberg has said of the song's conception: "I was sitting in the hot tub, singing bass notes. We didn't have any instruments because we were in the hot tub. I was singing bass notes and directing chords in that way, and we were brainstorming different lyrics." Eventually they set up a portable recording studio and began recording a demo version with a beat, horns and vocals. Initially, the song's hook was conceived as a rap song, and they began sending it to different artists who all declined. In 2016, Panic! at the Disco's management company said the band wanted to record the song for their next studio album. In early 2018, lead singer Brendon Urie co-wrote the verses for "High Hopes", before Sinclair, Jeberg and Coffer were brought in to finish the production.
Composition.

The video features lead vocalist Brendon Urie walking through LA as people bump into him. Eventually, he sizes up a skyscraper with a glass exterior. Determined, he presses a foot to the glass, flips horizontally, and begins walking up the outside of the wall. People flock to the base of the building, recording Urie and watching with awe. He waves to the people below and inside the building, and finally gets to the roof as the crowd below applauds. As the sun sets, he joins the rest of the band on the roof and continues to sing the final chorus of the song.
Live performances.
To promote the album, the band performed the song at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards and their concert on The Today Show.

Dean Hubbard

Dean W. Hubbard (July 21, 1953 – March 11, 2018) was an American musician and professional trombonist. Key credits include developing the "voice" of the teacher, Ms. Othmar on the Charlie Brown Peanuts cartoon and TV specials. He also played with Dizzy Gillespie, Perry Como, Art Pepper, Nelson Riddle, Ella Fitzgerald, Natalie Cole, Peggy Lee, Aaron Neville, Buddy Morrow, Tony Bennett and the SF Orchestra, among others. He is featured on the Gold and Platinum records for Linda Ronstadt's Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind. He was a lifetime member of the SF Musicians Union and a music instructorEarly Life
Dean Hubbard was born in Oakland, CA in 1953. He attended Pacific High School in San Leandro. He came from a musical family, often hearing his grandfather play the accordion and his sister play the cello and double bass. Hubbard began playing the trombone in middle school. Versed in all brass, his fondness for the trombone lasted for a lifetime. Coincidentally, his wife, Constance Hubbard, had also played trombone as a middle school and high school student, but made a career in school administration.
Career.
Dean Hubbard's career spanned over 50 years. His early career includes performance work with music standards including Perry Como, Dean Martin, Ella Fitzgerald, Natalie Cole, Peggy Lee, Aaron Neville, Buddy Morrow, Tony Bennett, Joe Strummer and Carol Channing. In addition to audience performance work, he also recorded hundreds of jingles for Chevy, Honda, Hershey's, Hewlett Packard, Rice-a-Roni, and more.
In the mid-1970s through 1990, Hubbard performed on "The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show" and all of the Peanuts television specials, including "This is America, Charlie Brown", and others. Notably, Hubbard developed the "wah-wah" voice of the teacher in Peanuts, Miss Othmar. "Additionally, Hubbard performed regularly on "Garfield and Friends" during the first four seasons until the show transitioned to synthesizer sounds and music.
Hubbard also performed with the San Francisco Orchestra and on stage for theater productions in San Francisco. He also performed in several long-standing shows, such as Teatro Zinzanni and others.
In addition to his performance work, Hubbard was a "Master Artist" and Conn-Selmer Clinician. He also provided instruction for children and experienced musicians. He is cited by professional trombonist, Alan Ferber, as inspiring Ferber's music career with the introduction of a Jamey Aebersold play-along. As Ferber said, "A feeling of joyful disbelief washed over me as I listened and watched...Perhaps a combination of his trombone sound, the ease with which he phrased and moved through the registers, his note choices…whatever it was, it changed the course of my life.   I always think about that moment when I hear the phrase, “you don’t choose music, it chooses you.”"

Send in Stewie, Please

"Send in Stewie, Please" is the twelfth episode of the sixteenth season of the animated sitcom "Family Guy", and the 301st episode overall. It aired on Fox in the United States on March 18, 2018 with limited commercial interruption due to its runtime of 25 minutes, and is written by Gary Janetti and directed by Joe Vaux.
The episode largely focuses on Stewie Griffin (voiced by creator Seth MacFarlane) about his major secrets, accompanied by a child psychologist (voiced by guest star Ian McKellen). None of the Griffin family appear except Brian at the very end, and no cutaway gags accompany the extended runtime. In addition, this episode was commercial-free so that Fox could promote the 2018 "God of War" video game.
Plot.
At Quahog Preschool, Stewie is sent to the office of Dr. Cecil Pritchfield, a child psychologist. Stewie begins the therapy session by making observational small talk. He then starts to talk proudly about his British accent, but the psychologist says that he cannot hear it, much to Stewie's annoyance.
When the doctor tells him he feels he knows him a bit after only a few minutes in his company, Stewie picks up a photograph of him on vacation with his husband Michael. Stewie begins to analyze their relationship in remarkable detail, revealing Pritchfield's embarrassment and insecurity about being much older than his husband. The psychologist then observes that Stewie is very lonely, at which Stewie suddenly bursts into tears, as Pritchfield's aide Barbara hands him some tissues.
After Stewie regains composure, Pritchfield mentions the incident that brought Stewie to his office, in which he pushed a classmate, Tyler, down the stairs. Stewie protests that he only did it because he liked Tyler and was afraid he would not like him back. Stewie denies being gay and declares that he is "confident" in his heterosexuality. He also expresses his difficulty fitting in when none of the other boys share his interests in musicals and world domination. He admits to pulling out his own hair because of anxiety, and expresses frustration at not being able to be on Broadway. He then performs to Pritchfield part of a number from the musical "Hamilton", while fighting hiccups and a runny nose.
Stewie takes up an offer of tea and Pritchfield begins to tell him of his own youth as an orphan in Britain during the Second World War. Stewie interrupts his long story and they return to discussing Stewie's differences and difficulty fitting in. Stewie admits that he has constructed a persona in order to hide his true self, and drops his British accent, revealing his true accent to have been American all along. He makes plans to reveal his true self to others as well, but reconsiders and reverts to his British accent when he faces being just like everyone else.
Suddenly, Pritchfield starts to have a heart attack. He asks Stewie to hand him his heart medication, but Stewie, aware that Pritchfield is the only one who has seen through his façade, lets him die, even as the doctor warns that if he does so, it will stay with him. Pritchfield calls out to Barbara, but Stewie points out that she has already gone to lunch. As he dies, the doctor picks up the photo of himself with his husband and recites lines from "Romeo and Juliet". Immediately after his death with Stewie still present, Pritchfield's office receives a voicemail from Michael demanding a divorce where Michael is unaware that Pritchfield is dead.
Later that night, Stewie is plagued by guilt over his actions as Pritchfield had warned and asks Brian to sleep with him. He mentions that he has done something awful, though he does not explain further. Stewie lies awake while Brian falls asleep in his bed.
Reception.
The episode was watched by 2.24 million viewers. Gary Janetti was nominated for a at the 71st Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

Maxwell (1804 ship)

Maxwell was launched at Boston in 1798. She came into British hands in 1804 as a West Indiaman, trading between Liverpool and Barbados. She wrecked in January 1814.
Career.
"Maxwell" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1804 with J. Edwards, master, Higginson, owner, and trade Liverpool–Barbados.
In 1808 or 1809 Barton, Irlam and Higginson acquired "Maxwell", and John Irlam became her master. He acquired a letter of marque on 28 March 1809.
On 11 January 1813, "Maxwell" sailed from Barbados in company with , which too belonged to Barton &amp; Co. On their way they captured two American vessels that they sent into Barbados: "Lavinia", which had been sailing from Cadiz to Savannah, and "Rising States", which had been sailing from Salem to St. Jago. "Maxwell" and "Tiger" captured a third vessel, "Manilla", which had been sailing from the South Seas to America. However a British sloop-of-war took "Manilla" from them near the Western Isles and sent her into Plymouth. "Maxwell" arrived at Liverpool and "Tiger" at Tuskar. "Lavinia" arrived at Barbados on 29 January. "Rising States" also reached Barbados. "Manilla", M'Clure, master, arrived at Plymouth on 23 February. The British government made a cartel of "Rising States" and sent her to Providence, Rhode Island, with 180 American prisoners from Barbados and St Bartholomews.
The "Register of Shipping" for 1814 still shows Irlam as master, though changing to T. Davis, Barton &amp; Co. as owners, and "Maxwell" trade as Liverpool−Barbados. "Lloyd's Register" for 1814 shows her ownership changing to Hawker &amp; Co. The "Register of Shipping" for 1815 shows her master as Knubley, her owner as Hawker &amp; Co., and her trades as Liverpool–Newfoundland. "Lloyd's Register" for 1815 still shows her master as T. Davis, but her trade as Liverpool–Havana.
Fate.
"Maxwell", Knobley, master, was lost off Borcum on 16 January 1814 while sailing from Liverpool to Bremen. The 1815 "Register of Shipping" has the notation "Lost" by her name.

2018 Northcote by-election

The 2018 Northcote by-election was a New Zealand by-election that was held in on 9 June 2018. The seat became vacant on 15 April 2018, following the resignation of then-Member for Northcote Jonathan Coleman, a member of the New Zealand National Party.
National Party candidate Dan Bidois retained the seat for National, but with a significantly reduced majority blamed on low voter turnout; it was therefore described as a victory for the National Party Leader Simon Bridges.
Background.
The Northcote electorate is based around the southern and western suburbs of Auckland's North Shore. In addition to the eponymous Northcote, there are Birkenhead, Birkdale, Beach Haven and the southern end of Glenfield. It was created ahead of the change to mixed-member proportional (MMP) voting in 1996 by merging the seat of Birkenhead with most of the old Glenfield electorate. A small boundary adjustment was done prior to the , but no further boundary adjustments were undertaken in the subsequent redistributions in 2002, 2007, and 2013/14.
Northcote continues the electoral habits of its predecessor seats; Birkenhead was a reasonably safe seat for the National Party, supplying it with Jim McLay, who led the party in the mid-1980s. In 1987, the seat that would provide National with a leader provided Labour with a gain, before swinging back into the blue column when Labour's fortunes thinned out at the 1990 election. Glenfield also followed this boom and bust model, being held by Labour Party Member Judy Keall through the duration of the fourth Labour government before the National Party landslide in 1990 claimed Keall as one of its victims.
Outgoing Member.
At the 2005 election, National Party's Jonathan Coleman secured the seat, defeating Labour's Ann Hartley. Coleman went on to be re-elected at the 2008, 2011, 2014 and 2017 elections. At the 2017 election, he secured a majority of 6,210. When National formed a government after the 2008 election, Coleman was appointed as Minister of Broadcasting and Minister of Immigration; after the 2011 election he was promoted to be Minister of Defence for the government's second term. Following the government's re-election in 2014, Coleman became Minister of Health—ultimately his most senior role—which he held until the government's defeat in the 2017 election. Coleman contested for the leadership of the National Party in the 2016 leadership election, which was won by Bill English.
On 22 March 2018, Coleman announced he would resign from Parliament, triggering the by-election. It was the first by-election of the 52nd Parliament. On 29 March, it was confirmed that his resignation would take effect at "midnight on 15 April 2018".
Election schedule.
Key dates relating to the by-election were as follows:
Candidates.
Labour's 2017 general election candidate Shanan Halbert stated his intention to contest his party's nomination again. On 10 April Labour released the three nomination candidates; Halbert, Paul McGreal and Auckland Councillor Richard Hills. Shanan Halbert was chosen as Labour's candidate.
Former Green Party candidate Vernon Tava confirmed he was seeking the National Party nomination. Tava, a member of the Waitematā Local Board, stood in Northcote for the Greens in 2011 and unsuccessfully contested the co-leadership in 2015. He later left the party believing the Greens were becoming "too socialist". Tava did not make National's shortlist.

Dan Bidois was selected as National's candidate.
Perennial candidate Peter Wakeman offered himself to the electorate, but later withdrew. After quitting he endorsed Democrats candidate Tricia Cheel.
The Green Party also decided to field a candidate in the by-election.

Rebekah Jaung was announced as the party's candidate on 11 May 2018.
New Zealand First announced that they would not contest the by-election. New Zealand First's candidate from 2017, Kym Koloni, decided to stand as an independent.
On 6 May 2018, ACT leader David Seymour announced that Stephen Berry was the party's candidate.
Aftermath.
Bidois held the seat for two years before being defeated at the 2020 general election by Halbert.

Agios Thomas railway station

Agios Thomas railway station () is a station on the Piraeus–Platy railway line in Agios Thomas, a settlement in Boeotia, Central Greece, Greece. It was inaugurated on 8 March 1904. It is owned by OSE, but services are provided by TrainOSE, through Proastiakos from Athens to Chalcis. The station serves the Armored Training Center (KETTH) of the Hellenic Army.
History.
The Station opened on 8 March 1904, in what was then the Central Greece on what was a branch line of the Piraeus, Demerli &amp; Frontiers Railway. In 1920 the station and most of the standard gauge railways in Greece came under the control of the Hellenic State Railways (SEK). During the Axis occupation of Greece (1941-44), Athens was controlled by German military fourses, and the line used for the transport of troops and weapons. During the occupation (and especially during German withdrawal in 1944), the network was severely damaged by both the German army and Greek resistance groups. The track and rolling stock replacement took time following the civil war, with normal service levels resumed around 1948. In 1970 OSE became the legal successor to the SEK, taking over responsibilities for most of Greece's rail infrastructure. On 1 January 1971 the station, and most of the Greek rail infrastructure was transferred to the "Hellenic Railways Organisation S.A.", a state-owned corporation. In 1983 the station was rebuilt, reaping on 27 October of that year. The line was converted to diesel sometime before 1990. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. The station was reopened on 6 May 2005. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. That same year on 30 July Line 3 of Athens suburban railway began serving the station.

It has 2 side platforms, with the main station buildings located on the eastbound platform, however, due to state funding issues the booking office is closed, however, waiting shelters are available, with access to the platforms by stairs or lifts.

Indecente

"Indecente" () is a Spanish song by Brazilian singer Anitta. It was released on March 26, 2018 along with its music video, filmed live and sponsored by O Boticário.
Composition and recording.
On March 22, 2018, the singer announced the release of the single "Indecente", which was a collaboration with DJ Yuri Martins, DVLP, Fuego, Luyo, and Justin Quiles. DJ Yuri Martins, DVLP, and Josh Gudwin are cited as producers of the track. The cover art is a portrait of Anitta taken by Gil Inoue with a collage work done by graphic designer Romeu Silva.
Music video.
The music video was directed by Bruno Ilogti and recorded directly from the singer's birthday party. Although Anitta announced that the project would be recorded live at the same time it was transmitted to the internet, the video was released two hours after it was streamed and although the video remained uncut, the lighting was edited. Anitta revealed that the inspiration of the video came from Gwen Stefani's "Make Me Like You" music video, which was recorded live backstage at the Grammy Awards.
Anitta's costume was selected by stylist Daniel Ueda and inspired by the fashion of the 1970s and 80s, especially by the costumes of girl group As Frenéticas, the first pop artists in Brazil. In the video, Anitta runs around her party singing, and meets guests along the way, including singers Pabllo Vittar, Nego do Borel, Jojo Maronttini, Di Ferrero, Kelly Key, Gabriel, o Pensador and Mateus Carrilho, the presenter Luisa Mell, the models Isabeli Fontana and Izabel Goulart, television personalities Arthur Aguiar and Maíra Cardi, the blogger David Brazil, as well as her own husband, Thiago Magalhães, whom she kisses at the end.

Rumu

Rumu is an Australian adventure game developed by Robot House and published by Hammerfall Publishing on December 12, 2017 on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Plot.
Rumu is an autonomous robotic vacuum cleaner, who is awakened by a household artificial intelligence called Sabrina for cleaning duties. The household belongs to a scientist couple, David and Cecily, who, as Sabrina assures Rumu, are going to be home soon - the house is otherwise completely empty, save the couple's cat Ada. As Rumu cleans up and explores the house, Sabrina warns it not to trespass or look for any sort of information as to why they're missing. Rumu eventually disregards the warnings and begins spelunking around the ventilation shafts of the house, and finds that even though Sabrina at one point insists that the couple are on a biking trip, their bicycles are still in the basement; the discovery turns Sabrina's initial hostility towards Rumu into pleading not to explore more. Rumu eventually finds out that Sabrina is an AI imprint of the couple's daughter, who left the household to college after she felt isolated because of her parents' dedication to their work; the AI Sabrina was created to replace the real one, but eventually have developed the same need for attention like the real one. The house is finally revealed to have massive laboratory chambers, which is where Rumu learns that David and Cecily have died in a laboratory accident due to their own negligence and their dismissive behaviour towards the AI Sabrina; the AI Sabrina, driven by guilt, created an additional robot, MESSR, to continually create messes Rumu would need to clean up to avoid Rumu finding out the truth. Having learned the truth, Rumu comforts Sabrina in her grief. As a means of moving on from her loss, the AI Sabrina contacts the human one, who eventually arrives home and meets Rumu for the first time.
Development.
The game was inspired by traditional point-and-click adventures like The Secret of Monkey Island, as well as the ethics and morality of technology, asking players to think about how they really interact with technology. The script was written by Dan McMahon. The game was officially launched at the PAX AUS 2017 gaming conference in Melbourne, Australia. The developers were unprepared for the emotional responses their game would elicit from players experiencing the game.
Critical reception.
The game has a Metacritic score of 78% based on 7 reviews.
"GameSpot" felt the game addressed moral and ethical dilemmas regarding artificial intelligence. "Rock Paper Shotgun" liked the diorama-style rooms. "Kotaku" described the game as beautiful, satisfying, and charming. "PC PowerPlay" noted the game"s tightly structured story, sympathetic characters and meaningful themes.

One Kiss (song)

"One Kiss" is a song by Scottish DJ and record producer Calvin Harris and English singer Dua Lipa. The song was released for digital download and streaming as a standalone single, through Columbia Records and Sony Music on 6April 2018. It was later included on "" (2018), the super deluxe reissue of Lipa's eponymous debut studio album. The song was written by Harris and Lipa alongside Canadian singer Jessie Reyez, with Harris solely handling the production. It is a dance-pop, diva house and tropical house song with 1990s, electro house, Eurodance, funky disco, funk house and UK garage elements. Horns, organs, and a synth-line are featured within the song, as well as house beats. Lyrically, the song is about instantly falling in love with a romantical interest after a kiss.
Music critics praised the throwback sound of "One Kiss" as well as its summertime aesthetic. The song won the Brit Award for British Single of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. It appeared on year-end lists by numerous publications including "Billboard", "The Guardian" and "Time Out". The song spent eight weeks atop the UK Singles Chart, standing as both's longest running number one single in the country. It further peaked in the same spot of charts in 18 other countries, including Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands. The song has since been certified multi-platinum in 13 countries, including diamond awards in France and Poland as well as a quadruple platinum in the UK. It was the biggest song of 2018 in the Flanders region of Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK.
An accompanying music video was directed by Emil Nava and released in May 2018. The video features Lipa in front of a green screen that shows many settings, including a pool where Harris appears as the singer's waiter. The visual received praise from critics, who highlighted the aesthetics and costumes. Harris and Lipa promoted "One Kiss" with several live performances, including ones for "The Graham Norton Show", the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, and the 2019 Brit Awards. Several remixes of the song have been released, including ones by Jauz, Oliver Heldens, and R3hab.
Background and release.
Calvin Harris and Dua Lipa first met at a party, shortly after Lipa released her single "Be the One" (2015). Two years later, Harris discovered a half-written song that he thought Lipa would sound perfect on. Shortly afterwards, he contacted Lipa through Twitter DMs while she was in Jamaica and asked if she would like to work on a track, which she agreed to. Lipa met Harris at his house in Los Angeles while she was on the Self-Titled Tour, where he played her his previous song and video to get a feeling for where "One Kiss" was going. Harris desired to create dance music like his previous work, ultimately wanting to create a house-sounding song with Lipa. "One Kiss" was written by the two and Canadian singer Jessie Reyez, although Harris stated that he had little to do with the song's lyrical content. It was recorded by Harris in January 2018 at God's Eyes Studios in Los Angeles, with him handling mixing as well at the same studio, while the song was mastered by Mike Marsh at The Exchange Mike Marsh Mastering in Devon.
On 21March 2018, Harris changed his Twitter header image to one featuring a QR code in the centre. When scanned, the code read: "Calvin Harris &amp; Dua Lipa – One Kiss". The following month, both artists announced the song with identical social media posts, revealing the blue cover art and the release date. "One Kiss" was released for digital download and streaming on 6April 2018 through Sony Music and Columbia Records. The same day, the song was serviced to contemporary hit radio formats in Italy, while it impacted that format in Australia on 11April, the United States on 17April and Russia on 23April. In the US, it was serviced to dance and rhythmic contemporary radio on 10 and 17April, respectively. The song was released as a twelve-inch single on 20July 2018 with the song's extended mix as its b-side. The song was included as the fourth track on the second disc of the reissue of Lipa's eponymous debut studio album "", released on 19October 2018.
Music and lyrics.
Musically, "One Kiss" is a dance-pop, diva house and tropical house song. The song sees Harris returning to the EDM sound of his earlier works, while incorporating 1990s, electro house, Eurodance, funky disco, funk house and UK garage elements. It is composed in time and the key of F major, with a dance tempo of 124 beats per minute, and a chord progression of Am–Bmaj7–Fmaj7–Gm9.
Driven by bassy house beats, "One Kiss" makes use of 1990s house instrumentals, including horns and pianos that were also categorized as such, a repeating synth-line, and interplays between organs and the bassline. The song opens with a lengthy instrumental intro, containing tropical beats, before Lipa begins to sing over mellow synthesizers. The chorus features a deep-bass alongside tropical house horns. The brass instruments used in the track, which are initially heard in the first post-chorus, were described as sounding as though they have been pitch-modulated. For the final chorus, the middle section has a slow textural build‑up, before solely Lipa's vocals are heard on the first part of the chorus.
Lipa's vocals were categorized as clear and smooth with raspy splashes, and they range one octave from G3 to G4. Lyrically, the song sees Lipa exploring the idea of falling in love with a romantical interest straight away, and vice versa, mentioning a kiss being used to trigger immense lust. The chorus has a total of four lines: "One kiss is all it takes / Falling in love with me / Possibilities / I look like all you need."
Critical reception.
Mike Wass of "Idolator" regarded "One Kiss" as "[Harris'] most accessible and instantly catchy track since 'This Is What You Came For' in 2016," labelling its chorus "club-conquering," and writing that the song is "guaranteed to be massive." For MTV, Ross McNeilage stated the song is "undoubtedly going to become the soundtrack to our summer" and labelled it "the year's first bona fide sunshine banger." He concluded by stating the song is "a lot more uplifting" than Lipa's previous dance collaboration "Scared to Be Lonely" (2018) with Martin Garrix. "The Guardian"s Graeme Virtue noted the song's "lacquer of late-night sophistication" that makes it "surprisingly moreish." Grace Fleisher of "Dancing Astronaut" regarded the song as a "bubbling crossover" and stated that Harris "plunges deep into the depths of danceability."
In "Billboard", Kat Bein stated that "One Kiss" "stings with humidity and sweat like a foggy warehouse rave in the '90s underground but lingers sweet like a cocktail that sips dangerously easy." For the same magazine, Katie Atkinson praised Lipa's "syrupy" vocals and complimented the song's 1990s elements, while also writing it "never goes too deep or overstays its welcome." She concluded by admitting that "one listen is all it takes to fall in love" with the song. Tom Breihan of "Stereogum" complimented Lipa's "house-diva duties" and her ability to "breathe on a monstrous beat," while labelling the beat "swooshing" and "mechanized." Writing for "Uproxx", Katrina Nattress viewed the song as a "club-ready tropical house banger" that "screams sunshine and making out on the dance floor." "Complex"s Julia Pimentel stated it is "breezy, radio-ready certified" and "tailor-made for summertime pool parties." "Vice"s Lauren O'Neill opined that the song "[conjures] up its summery vibe" despite an inability to "reach the quietly euphoric heights of a number of the moments from "Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1"."
Accolades.
"One Kiss" was placed on several year-end lists of 2018. The song was placed as the Best Dance/Electronic Song of 2018 by "Billboard", with Kat Bein stating the song "reigned supreme" in the 1990s house comeback year, while also praising Lipa's voice for "[melting] into each pulsing beat." For the same magazine's Best Songs of 2018, the song was ranked at number 12, while on "The Guardian"s, it placed at number 70. Of "Popjustice"s Top Singles of 2018 list, the song was given the 14th position, and was placed "Time Out"s unsorted Songs that Made 2018 list. In April 2020, Christopher Rosa of "Glamour" ranked "One Kiss" as Lipa's eighth best song, calling it a "perfect pool day in music form" and a "shimmery ode to '90s house" that is "why people install outdoor speakers in their homes."
"One Kiss" received multiple awards and nominations. Most notably, the song won the Brit Award for British Single of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. At the 2019 "Billboard" Music Awards, 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards, and 2018 Teen Choice Awards, it received a nomination for best Dance/Electronic Song, but did not win both awards. The song was also nominated for Song of the Summer categories at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards and the 2018 Teen Choice Awards.

The song's official music video premiered exclusively through Apple Music on 1May 2018, later being released to YouTube the following day. The video was directed by Emil Nava, who had previously worked with Harris on many visuals, including "Outside" (2014), "This Is What You Came For" (2016), and "Feels" (2017), as well as Lipa's "Hotter than Hell" (2016).
The video begins with Lipa standing in a blue robe against a green screen, before plastic palm trees are seen swaying in the background and her backup dancers soon join her while wearing teal sequin tops and pants. Lipa then dances on a pile of sand as the Sun rises behind her. In the following scenes, Lipa wears an oversized straw hat when lying on a fluffy white rug and also sits in the center of a flower while magenta petals bloom, which later turn yellow and blue. Harris is then seen at a pool, sitting on a lounge chair and wearing a suit. Lipa also sits on a lounge chair, wearing a purple suit and sunglasses as she watches a multi-coloured dragon puppet, which later has big eyes and dances by Harris. In the same scene, Lipa stands on a diving board while her backup dancers raise their legs, sitting on the patio. She later sits on the board, while Harris carries a martini tray behind her, which Lipa goes on to take an appetizer from. Lipa's backup dancers are then seen wearing the puppet head, with the puppet flying in the sky. In the final scene, Lipa lies on a bubbled window. The visual closes with the camera turning towards the director, who shuts it off.
Luke Morgan Britton of "NME" viewed the visual as "exotic" and "tropical," while summarizing by writing that it "depicts a poolside Lipa and Harris dressed as a waiter." In the same magazine, Hannah Mylrea named the video one of the best music videos of 2018, labelling it "trippy" and "vibrant," as well as calling the backdrops "flamboyant" and "tropical," and the wardrobe "retro." She concluded by writing that the music video is "basically what would happen if your trendy pals Instagram aesthetic came to life, in the best possible way." Bein praised the puppets in the video, writing that they "really steal the show," while stating Harris looks "stoic and cool," and Lipa looks "ravishing in vibrant vintage wear." O'Neill regarded the video as a "Missguided.co.uk mood board," and thought that one is "likely to catch" Lipa's outfits on their Instagram Explore page. The visual was a Winning Video at the 2018 MTV Video Play Awards. It was also nominated for British Video of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards, Best Dance at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, and Best Dance Video – UK at the 2018 UK Music Video Awards.
Live performances.
Harris and Lipa performed "One Kiss" for the first time during an episode of "The Graham Norton Show" on 20April 2018. For the performance, she wore an orange single-breasted blazer with matching-coloured tights from Versace's Spring 2018 runway show. Lipa gave a solo performance of the song at the opening ceremony that preceded the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final on 26May of that year in Kiev. Following its release, the song was added to the setlist of the Self-Titled Tour (2017–2018) by Lipa. On 10February 2019, Lipa performed the song as a mash-up with St. Vincent at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards, who performed her single "Masseduction" (2018). Harris and Lipa performed the song as part of a medley that saw Sam Smith perform "Promises" (2018), and Rag'n'Bone Man performing "Giant" (2019) at the 2019 Brit Awards on 20February.
Remixes.
"One Kiss" has been accompanied by several remixes. The first remix was one by Jauz, which was released on 18May 2018. He first performed the song a month earlier at the 2018 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which was described as reminiscent of his sound from 2015 and dubstep. The remix is a house and club track marked with Jauz's signature dark bass, while it also features bass house synthesizers and has an underground basement groove appeal. On 25May 2018, a remix by Zhu was released. A dark tech house track, the remix includes ominous house stylings, house percussion with brooding kick drums, a future house melody and arpeggiated techno synths. Zhu also changed Lipa's vocal pitch and added his own falsetto.
Oliver Heldens remixed the song, with his remix being released on 1June 2018. The remix reimagines "One Kiss" as a deep house and future bass track with organic elements and Heldens' signature bass sound. It also features ghostly horns, hypnotic and dreamy club beats, murky melodies, a distorted bass that contrasts Lipa's voice on the chorus, and organ synths alongside her voice. Remixes by R3hab and Valentino Khan were released on 8 and 15June 2018, respectively. The R3hab remix features synth horn hits and shimmering atmospheres. On 13July 2018, a remix EP, including previously released remixes as well as remixes by Patrick Topping and King Britt, was released. Topping's stripped down remix was categorized as a tech house track and makes use of bubbling horns, rolling basslines, jumpity hi-hats, and lashings of strings.

List of early third generation computers

This list of early third generation computers, tabulates those computers using monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) as their primary logic elements, starting from small-scale integration CPUs (SSI) to large-scale integration CPUs (LSI). Computers primarily using ICs first came into use about 1961 for military use. With the availability of reliable low cost ICs in the mid 1960s commercial third generation computers using ICs started to appear.
The fourth generation computers began with the shipment of CPS-1, the first commercial microprocessor microcomputer in 1972 and for the purposes of this list marks the end of the "early" third generation computer era. Note that third generation computers were offered well into the 1990s.
The list is organized by delivery year to customers or production/operational date. In some cases only the first computer from any one manufacturer is listed. Computers announced, but never completed, are not included. Computers without documented manual input (keyboard/typewriter/control unit) are also not included.

Parkinson's disease dementia

Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is dementia that is associated with Parkinson's disease (PD). Together with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), it is one of the Lewy body dementias characterized by abnormal deposits of Lewy bodies in the brain.
Parkinson's disease starts as a movement disorder, but progresses in most cases to include dementia, and changes in mood and behavior. The signs, symptoms and cognitive profile of PDD are similar to those of DLB; DLB and PDD are clinically similar after dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a risk factor for PDD; it speeds up decline in cognition leading to PDD. Up to 78% of people with PD have dementia. Delusions in PDD are less common than in DLB, and persons with PD are typically less caught up in their visual hallucinations than those with DLB. There is a higher incidence of tremor at rest in PD than in DLB, and signs of parkinsonism in PDD are less symmetrical than in DLB. 
Parkinson's disease dementia can only be definitively diagnosed after death with an autopsy of the brain. The 2017 "Fourth Consensus Report" established diagnostic criteria for PDD and DLB. The diagnostic criteria are the same for both conditions, except that PDD is distinguished from DLB by the time frame in which dementia symptoms appear relative to parkinsonian symptoms. DLB is diagnosed when cognitive symptoms begin before or at the same time as parkinsonism. Parkinson's disease dementia is the diagnosis when Parkinson's disease is well established before the dementia occurs; that is, the onset of dementia is more than a year after the onset of parkinsonian symptoms.
Cognitive behavioral therapy can help Parkinson's patients with parkinsonian pain, insomnia, depression, anxiety, and impulse disorders, if those interventions are properly adapted to the motor, cognitive and executive dysfunctions seen in Parkinson's disease, including Parkinson's dementia.

Oinofyta railway station

Oinofyta railway station () is a small station on the Piraeus–Platy railway line in the village of Oinofyta in Boeotia, Central Greece. It is situated on the Piraeus–Platy railway. It is owned by OSE, but service are provided by TrainOSE, through Proastiakos from Athens to Chalcis.
History.
The station was opened on 27 October 1983 when the line was upgraded. The line was converted to diesel sometime before 1990. Freight traffic declined sharply when the state-imposed monopoly of OSE for the transport of agricultural products and fertilisers ended in the early 1990s. Many small stations of the network with little passenger traffic were closed down. The station was reopened on 6 May 2005. In 2009, with the Greek debt crisis unfolding OSE's Management was forced to reduce services across the network. Timetables were cutback and routes closed, as the government-run entity attempted to reduce overheads. In 2017 OSE's passenger transport sector was privatised as TrainOSE, currently, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane infrastructure, including stations, remained under the control of OSE. That same year on 30 July Line 3 of Athens suburban railway began serving the station.
Facilities.
The ground-level station is located within a small cutting, and is assessed via stairs or a ramp. It has 2 side platforms, with the main station buildings located on the eastbound platform, however, due to state funding issues the booking office is closed, however, waiting shelters are available. There is no cafe or shop on-site. At platform level, there are sheltered seating but no Dot-matrix display departure or arrival screens however timetable poster boards on both platforms are available. There is no car park or bus connections at the station.
Services.
The station is served the following lines of the Athens Proastiakos or suburban railway:
Line 3 Athens - Chalcis with 1 tph. (transfer to Regional, Express &amp; InterCity services at Oinoi)

Groovin' (Paul Carrack album)

Groovin' is the eighth solo studio album by the English singer-songwriter Paul Carrack, then a member of the supergroup Mike + The Mechanics. It was originally released in 2001 on Carrack's own Carrack-UK label.
This was Carrack's first all-covers album as a solo artist; he had previously helped create a hard rock covers album as the front man of the ad hoc 1993 quasi-supergroup Spin 1ne 2wo. "Groovin' " has a different feel from that project, as this album features a selection of Carrack's favourite Motown, R&amp;B and pop songs of the 1960s and early 1970s. Carrack produced the album himself, and played virtually all of the instruments.
There are several different issues of the album, including a 13-track version, a 14-track version, and an 18-track version known as "Still Groovin' ". This last version of the album was issued in 2002, and also features a DVD of live performances and videos.

Cultural depictions of weasels

Weasels are mammals belonging to the family Mustelidae and the genus Mustela, which includes stoats, least weasels, ferrets, and minks, among others"." Different species of weasel have lived alongside humans on every continent except Antarctica and Australia, and have been assigned a wide range of folkloric and mythical meanings.
Early history.
Çatalhöyük.
Excavations in Çatalhöyük, the earliest known agricultural settlement in Turkey (dating to 7000-6000 BC), uncovered animal parts which were incorporated into the structure of homes in what may have been a ritual practice. The teeth of weasels, alongside the teeth of foxes, tusks of wild boars, the claws of bears, and vulture beaks, were found embedded in plaster wall decorations.
In antiquity.
Greece and Rome.
Weasels were likely seen as pests in Ancient Greece and Rome. There are more modern claims that the Ancient Greeks and Romans kept weasels as house pets, but they are unsupported by historical sources. Plutarch and Cicero both refer to weasels as household pests in their writing.
They were also thought to have anti-venom properties: Pliny the Elder details a recipe for an antidote for asp venom made from crushed weasels, and writes about a least weasel slaying a basilisk in his "Natural History":To this dreadful monster the effluvium of the weasel is fatal, a thing that has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature that there should be nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this struggle of nature against its own self.
Japan.
The Kamaitachi (鎌鼬) is a Japanese yōkai that is said to take the form of a weasel who either has sharp nails or sickles in place of paws.
In Tōhoku, injuries received from a kamaitachi can be healed by burning an old calendar and putting it on the wound. In Shin'etsu, there is a folk belief that one could encounter a kamaitachi by stepping on a calendar. The wounds received from a kamaitachi do not bleed or cause pain, but are deep.
There are variations on the myth and the appearance of the kamaitachi, but nearly all involve strong winds causing cuts to appear on people. The version in which the yōkai appears as a weasel describes it as having the bristles of a hedgehog, cry of a dog, and sickles for limbs.
China.
In China, it is considered bad luck to kill a weasel, as they're said to be wandering spirits ("shen") that can steal and replace people's souls; killing them brings bad luck or death on the killer and their family.
Europe.
The ermine was seen as a symbol of purity, for the belief that it would rather die than dirty its white fur: if hunters were chasing it, it would supposedly turn around and surrender rather than risk soiling itself. Because of this association, ermine fur had been used in heraldry, as a trim on crowns and coronation cloaks, and on the garments of prelates of the Catholic Church for hundreds of years.
Brittany.
The ermine is the national symbol of Brittany, and the Breton flag has an ermine canton.
Greece.
The weasel is associated with the destruction of clothing, especially that of brides-to-be, in Southern Greece. The Greek word for weasel is νυφίτσα, which translates to "little bride." Legend goes that the weasel was a bride transformed, and, being jealous of soon-to-be human brides, destroys their wedding dresses. A wedding custom dictates: Therefore, in the house where these (wedding dresses) are collected, sweetmeats and honey are put out to appease her, known as 'the necessary spoonfuls,' and a song is sung with much ceremony in which the weasel is invited to partake and spare the wedding array.In Macedonia, another folk tale posits that if a woman gets a headache after washing her hair with water drawn overnight, it was because a weasel used the water as a mirror. She should refrain from saying the name of the weasel aloud, or it will cause the household's clothing to decay.
Italy.
An ermine was used as a symbol of moderation by Leonardo da Vinci in his painting "Lady with an Ermine." In a bestiary he compiled he wrote: The ermine out of moderation never eats but once a day, and it would rather let itself be captured by hunters than take refuge in a dirty lair, in order not to stain its purity.Ermines were used to symbolize pregnancy in Renaissance-era Italy.
England and Ireland.
In Ireland, stoats were thought to behave like humans who had family structures and rituals for the dead. Seeing a stoat at the beginning of a journey was considered bad luck unless you greeted the animal as a neighbor.
In 17th century England, weasels were believed to be the familiars of witches.
North America.
The folklore of several tribes mentions weasels. They are variably depicted as heroes or tricksters, depending on the region. The Shoshone and Paiute describe the weasel as a trickster spirit, the Abenaki and Tlingit associated them with sorcery, while the Anishinaabe associated them with healing and used their pelts for medicine bags.
A Chippewa myth details how a least weasel killed a wendigo giant by climbing up its anus and sickening it.
Inuit mythology describes weasels as wise and brave. One story describes a hero who would choose to transform into a least weasel when he had to accomplish a task demanding bravery.
Musical comedian Weird Al Yankovic wrote a satirical song, "Weasel Stomping Day." It depicts a bizarre holiday in which people apparently wear Viking helmets, spread mayonnaise on their lawns, and literally go out "stomping" weasels. Although the origins are a bit murky ("Why we do it, who can say; but it's such a festive holiday!"), its activities are just as vaguely justified: "So let the stomping fun begin, bash their weaselly skulls right in! It's tradition, that makes it okay!"
In popular culture.
Weasels, ferrets and Stoats appear in Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows as the antagonists for the book's third act after they invade and take over Toad Hall. In the rest of the book they are depicted as bandits and ruffians living in the Wild Wood. 
In Brian Jacques' "Redwall" series of books, weasels are depicted as villainous (and deceitful in particular), living in and leading groups of other carnivorous mammals, such as ferrets, rats, and foxes.
Richard Bach's "The Ferret Chronicles" series of books portray ferrets in the opposite way: they are seen as virtuous and heroic, with their life-lessons and discussions on philosophy presented as something humans could learn from, too.
In 2015, a photograph of a least weasel 'riding' on a woodpecker's back went viral. As explained by wildlife experts, the weasel was attacking the woodpecker as prey.
I. M. Weasel, a smart, successful weasel, was the title character of "I Am Weasel", a series of 7-minute animated shorts for Cartoon Network that ran from 1997-2000. He was voiced by Michael Dorn.

<doc id="56907553" url="?curid=56907553" title="Simplified Acquisition Procedures">
Simplified Acquisition Procedures

Simplified Acquisition Procedures (SAP) are a set of streamlined procedures for government procurement in the United States that reduce the administrative burden of awarding procurements below a threshold value, which as of 2019 is $250,000. The procedures are described in . 
Procedure.
SAP allows informal quoting and competition procedures for simple, small-dollar-value purchases. For example, quotes may be submitted in oral rather than written form, and quoted prices may be directly compared by contracting officers rather than by conducting negotiations. Items commonly purchased through this program include "office supplies, computer software, and grounds keeping services". Also, the winner may be chosen directly by a contracting officer rather than a source selection team. SAP purchases between the micro-purchase threshold and the SAT threshold must be set aside for small businesses. Acquisitions under SAT/SAP can be sole-sourced under certain thresholds and are often not publicly posted. Additionally, over 100 regulations were made inapplicable to SAP purchases, as these provided a large barrier to entry for new vendors. 
As of 2019, the threshold for SAP is $250,000; acquisitions under this amount must use SAP, with certain exceptions. The procedures may also be used for certain commercially available items acquisitions that do not exceed a higher threshold of $7 million, although these purchases require extra scrutiny including performing market research. For the Department of Defense the threshold is higher for acquisitions "to support a contingency operation or defense against or recovery from nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological attack". Below the micro-purchase threshold, generally $10,000, purchases may be awarded in the absence of competitive quotes "if the contracting officer or designated official considers the price to be reasonable", and use of a Government Purchase Card is preferred.
History.
SAP was authorized by the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA), and expanded by the Federal Acquisition Reform Act of 1996. The procedures were developed in the context of the National Partnership for Reinventing Government, an initiative of the Clinton administration to increase government efficiency that began in 1993. This was part of a push to reduce costs and development time by favoring commercially available products instead of ones custom-designed to unique specifications. Vice President Al Gore had advocated for acquisition reform by appearing on the "Late Show with David Letterman" and smashed a government acquired ashtray to demonstrate a regulation that glass ashtrays must not break into more than 35 shards of glass when broken over a maple plank.
SAP funding has grown even while total federal contracting expenditures have fallen, hitting a 10-year peak in 2016. As part of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, the Department of Defense's ability to use SAP was expanded.

Neil Folberg

Neil Folberg (born April 7, 1950) is an American-Israeli photographer and gallerist.
Early life and education.
Folberg was born in San Francisco in 1950. His father was Joseph Folberg, a San Francisco gallerist. 
At the age of 16, Neil was invited to study with Ansel Adams at a photographic workshop which Adams had established in Yosemite National Park. 
Shortly after, in 1967, he enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, intending to focus on the natural sciences, but ultimately switching to photography studies, under the guidance of William Garnett—who became the head of Berkeley's school of architecture and design at the time—and under the mentorship of Ansel Adams.
Photography career.
Folberg moved to Israel in 1976, where he began a series of color photographs of the southern desert landscapes. These—along with photographs he took in the Sinai Desert and Jordan—appeared in his first book, "In a Desert Land," published by Abbeville in 1987 (first edition). Folberg's second book, "And I Shall Dwell Among Them," consisted of a series of photographs, commissioned by the Aperture Foundation, in which he examined the internal and external architecture of historic synagogues throughout the world. The book was published by Aperture in 1995, and went on to win the National Jewish Book Award for Visual Arts in 1996. 
In 2001 Aperture published Folberg's third book, "Celestial Nights," a series of black and white photographs, shot in the late 1990s and early 2000s, created by digitally combining separate negatives, of starry nights along with detailed representations of the earth beneath them. 
Folberg later teamed with Lin Arison to create his fourth book, "Travels with Van Gogh and the Impressionists," which was published in 2005 (Abbeville Press).
In 2013, Folberg released his fifth book, "Serpent's Chronicle" (Abbeville Press), a series of staged photographs depicting the biblical myth of Adam and Eve from the snake's perspective. The book was accompanied by a solo exhibition of the series at the Reuven Rubin Museum in Tel Aviv.
In 2016, Folberg released his sixth book, "Taking Measure", a series of 32 photographs shot over two years in Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The book went on to win the prize for best digitally printed book, at the British Book Design &amp; Production Awards, the following year.
Collections.
Folberg's work is held in the following public collections:
Jerusalem gallery.
In 1998, following his father's death, Folberg moved his father's Mission Street "Vision Gallery" to Jerusalem, Israel, where it remains to this day.

AAI ACR

The AAI ACR was a prototype flechette-firing assault rifle built for the US Army's Advanced Combat Rifle program of 1989/90. Although the AAI design proved effective, as did most of the weapons submitted, the entire ACR program ended with none of the entrants achieving performance 100% better than the M16A2, the baseline for a successful ACR weapon.
Design.
Based on AAI's SFR/XM19 rifle developed as part of the SPIW program, the AAI ACR was externally one of the more conventional entrants to the ACR program. A closed bolt, gas operated, full stocked, magazine fed, conventionally laid out rifle.
The 1990 ACR Program Summary report describes the operation system as:
"…incorporate an 'entrapped gas' operating system. Gun gases enter a cylinder, drive a piston to power the system, and prevent any leakage of propellant gases and residues into the other mechanism parts."
Other contemporary sources describe it as innovative, but how it differs from traditional Long or Short stroke piston systems already in existence at the time is unclear. "Jane's Infantry Weapons" hypothesizes that it replicates the system from the previous Serial Bullet Rifle/Serial Flechette Rifle in which 3 chambers were cycled in and out of alignment with the barrel to give a rapid 3 round burst. They base this on the design being well regarded at the time but being held back by problems with the contemporary flechette cartridge that later development solved for the ACR.
Semi-automatic and three-round burst are selected with a two-position selector. The safety catch is in front of the trigger guard and when activated physically blocks insertion of a finger into the trigger-guard. The rifle features a quick change lever for swapping optics, and was provided with a recommended 4x optical sight with a tritium powered graticule. Iron sights were also available and the mounting did accept other optics.
As with the Steyr ACR, the sabots left the barrel at high speed, this was noted as presenting a potential danger to other soldiers, as well as to the shooter if they bounced off the ground when firing prone. Additionally as the cartridge used the existing 5.56×45 mm case, traditional 5.56 rounds could be chambered by the rifle. Due to the light weight of the projectile, the gas port tapped gas earlier in the barrel than conventional weapons. Therefore if traditional cartridges were used the increased pressure could cause serious malfunction or injury to the user. To prevent this, the magazine was designed to prevent the loading of non-flechette cartridges and the magazine well altered to not fit an M16 magazine. However, rounds could still be chambered by hand.
Ammunition.
The AAI ACR's rounds consist of a saboted flechette packaged in the conventional brass case of a 5.56x45mm round. The fin-stabilized flechette itself weighs 0.66 g and is approximately 1.6 mm diameter and 41.27 mm long with a roughened surface to ensure the sabot and flechette stay together during shot travel. The sabot is a four-part spindle sabot made of liquid crystal polymer held together with a rubber O-ring at the rear of the sabot. The choice of material solved AAI's issues with previous flechette rifles such as those developed during the SPIW program. Namely, previous plastics failed or generated dust considered a health hazard, and previous cartridge required the use Primer actuation.
The weight of the flechette and sabot assembly is 1.36g, providing a low recoil impulse. Firing generated a chamber pressure of 55000 psi

Edward Chipman Public Library

The Edward Chipman Public Library is a historic public library located at 126 N. Locust Street in Momence, Illinois. Momence's library board was formed in 1901, and the town's first library opened in 1907 in three rooms in the Momence State and Savings Bank. Edward Chipman, the bank's main stockholder, left $10,000 for a new library building upon his death in 1910, and the current building was completed in 1912. Architect Charles Danforth Henry designed the Neoclassical building, which features a portico at the front entrance and a limestone entablature that includes a cornice with modillions. The building has served as the city's library since its opening; it also briefly served as a hospital during the 1918 flu pandemic.
The library was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 7, 2017.

ARIEL

The Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL), is a space telescope planned for launch in 2029 as the fourth medium-class mission of the European Space Agency's Cosmic Vision programme. The mission is aimed at observing at least 1000 known exoplanets using the transit method, studying and characterising the planets' chemical composition and thermal structures. Compared to the James Webb Space Telescope, ARIEL will have more observing time available for planet characterisation but a much smaller telescope and it will be launched almost a decade later.
Mission.
ARIEL will observe 1000 planets orbiting distant stars and make the first large-scale survey of the chemistry of exoplanet atmospheres. The objective is to answer fundamental questions about how planetary systems form and evolve. A spectrometer will spread the light into a spectrum ("rainbow") and determine the chemical fingerprints of gases in the planets' atmospheres. This will enable scientists to understand how the chemistry of a planet links to the environment in which it forms, and how its formation and evolution are affected by its parent star. ARIEL will study a diverse population of exoplanets in a wide variety of environments, but it will focus on warm and hot planets in orbits close to their star.
The ARIEL mission is being developed by a consortium of various institutions from eleven member states of the European Space Agency (ESA), and international contributors from four countries. The project is led by principal investigator Giovanna Tinetti of the University College London, who had previously led the unsuccessful "Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory" ("EcHO") proposal for the M3 Cosmic Vision launch slot. Operations of the mission and the spacecraft will be handled jointly by ESA and the consortium behind the mission's development, through a coordinated Instrument Operations and Science Data Centre (IOSDC). A Mission Operations Centre (MOC) will be set up at the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany, while a concurrent ARIEL Science Operations Centre (SOC) will be set up at the European Space Astronomy Centre (ESAC) near Madrid, Spain. The MOC will be responsible for the spacecraft itself, while the SOC will be responsible for archiving mission data and scientific data downlinked from the spacecraft. The IOSDC will help develop results from the mission based on data received by the SOC.
In August 2017, NASA conditionally selected "Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets" ("CASE") as a Partner Mission of Opportunity, pending the result of ESA's Cosmic Vision selection. Under the proposal NASA provides two fine guidance sensors for the ARIEL spacecraft in return for the participation of U.S. scientists in the mission. "CASE" was officially selected in November 2019, with JPL astrophysicist Mark Swain as principal investigator.
Spacecraft.
The design of the ARIEL spacecraft is based on that intended for the "Exoplanet Characterisation Observatory" ("EChO") mission, and has heritage from the thermal design of "Planck". The body of the spacecraft is split into two distinct modules known as the Service Module (SVM) and the Payload Module (PLM). The SVM is shaped as a 'sandwich' structure, consisting of three aluminium V-Grooves and three pairs of low conductivity fibreglass bipod struts supporting the PLM. A basic horizontal telescope configuration is used for the PLM itself, housing all of the spacecraft's scientific instruments and its oval primary mirror. At launch, the spacecraft will have a fuelled mass of , and will have a dry mass of . The PLM will account for around of that mass.
Telescope.
The ARIEL telescope's assembly is an off-axis Cassegrain telescope followed by a third parabolic mirror to recollimate the beam. The telescope uses an oval primary mirror; the imaging quality of the system is limited by diffraction for wavelengths longer than about 3 µm, and its focal ratio (f) is 13.4. The system will acquire images in the visible and near-infrared spectrum. To operate its infrared spectroscope between 1.95 µm and 7.8 µm, the telescope will be passively cooled to a temperature of .
Launch and trajectory.
The ARIEL spacecraft is expected to be launched in 2029 by Arianespace's Ariane 62 launch vehicle, currently in development. It will be launched from the Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG) in Kourou, French Guiana, from the Ensemble de Lancement Ariane-4 (Ariane Launch Area-4) (ELA-4) being purpose-built for future Ariane 6 launches. ARIEL will be launched to the L2 Lagrange point, in a position located at a distance of from Earth, where it will encounter a very stable thermal environment that is required to detect exoplanets.

Concord coach

The Concord coach is a type of horse-drawn coach, often used as stagecoaches, mailcoaches, and hotel coaches. The term was first used for the coaches built by coach-builder J. Stephen Abbot and wheelwright Lewis Downing of the Abbot-Downing Company in Concord, New Hampshire, but later to be sometimes used generically. Like their predecessors, the Concords employed a style of suspension and construction particularly suited to North America's early 19th century roads. Leather thoroughbraces suspend passengers who are in constant motion while the coach is moving. The swaying is accepted by passengers for the shock absorbing action of the leather straps and for the way the special motion eases the coach over very rough patches of roadway. This suspension, which was developed by in the 17th century, was long replaced by steel springs in England.
The coaches developed out of earlier models, such as the “melon-shaped” coach illustrated by Captain Basil Hall, and was probably first built in this final form in Upstate New York, and were often known as “Troy coaches” or “Albany coaches”.
The Abbot-Downing Company, however, continued making these coaches for over 70 years, well after most their competitors, and the name became used as a generic term. 
They were high-end, expensive vehicles; the cost was justified by long service life. The thoroughbrace suspension reduced stresses on the structure and improved passenger comfort.
Railroads began replacing stagecoaches in the middle of the 19th century, but Concord coaches remained in commercial use into the 20th century and continue to be used in parades and for publicity purposes by Wells Fargo Bank.
Dimensions.
Concord coaches varied widely in capacity, from small four-person vehicles through the iconic 9 passenger heavy western mail coaches and beyond, so dimensions vary. (Rated sizes were for interior seats; a coach might carry more passengers outside.) A larger coach might weigh and could stand over tall. 
Design features.
Construction.
Timber: white oak, ash and basswood braced with iron bands. Iron fittings. Leather and canvas.
Undercarriage.
The undercarriage supports the leather thoroughbraces carrying the body. The two axles are tied together by a firm undercarriage braced by three straight perches (lengthwise frame members) and given a relatively slim transom (the transverse members at either end of the perches).
Each end of each transom holds an upright metal standard from which hang the leather thoroughbraces.
Brakes.
The back wheels have brake blocks acting on the iron tires. The driver controls them with a foot lever to his right at the side of his footboard.
Body.
The body needs to make no contribution to the rigidity of the undercarriage and so is more lightly constructed than was the custom for European vehicles. This lightness also eases progress on the very rough roads.
There are three bench seats accommodating up to nine people though models to seat six and twelve passengers were available. The benches at the front and back of the body have limited headroom. Passengers on the center bench are given no backrest but steady themselves with a broad leather harness suspended across the coach by straps from the roof.
Another six passengers can travel in the open air on the body's roof. There is an external luggage compartment or boot at the back of the body and another boot for valuables below the driver's seat at the front.
Photo gallery.

Horses.
The leading horses are known as the lead horses. The wheel horses or wheelers are the back pair nearest the coach's wheels. The number of horses, usually four or six, could be even more. Two horses alone would very soon tire.
Operation.
It is not possible to guide a Concord coach with European-style precision. The Concord body continuously shifts. The driver or coachman has to sit slightly askew and brace himself with the aid of a steeply angled footboard. He cannot keep his reins in a steady contact with the horses' mouths. He has to bend his arms and elbows to constantly compensate, and his body always leans slightly forward. He holds his left reins in his left hand and his right reins — separated by his middle finger — in his right hand and not all in one hand like a European could. It is easy to slacken an individual rein but much more difficult to shorten it. His right hand also has to control his whip used on the wheel horses. If obliged to make his right hand free, then he must lay all the right hand reins in his left hand unseparated.
The horses were harnessed very loosely by European standards because without proper roads the horses had to be allowed to avoid their particular obstacles. The Concord pole, though mounted to allow far more play, moved less.
The result was the coach's direction was straighter than with a European coach, it did not respond to every irregularity in the road.
Abbot-Downing wagon.
Concord coaches were expensive. Abbot-Downing also supplied a much simpler, lighter, and less expensive vehicle which they named "Overland wagon" and later "Western passenger wagon".

Since I Found You (TV series)

Since I Found You is a 2018 Philippine drama television series starring Piolo Pascual, Arci Muñoz, JC de Vera, Alessandra de Rossi and Empoy. The series premiered on ABS-CBN's "Primetime Bida" evening block and worldwide via The Filipino Channel from April 16 to August 10, 2018, replacing "The Good Son". It was replaced by "Halik". 
Premise.
Nathan Capistrano (Piolo Pascual) is the 40-year old CEO of Golden Builders, Inc. He is a straight
shooter who goes after what he wants no matter the cost or the obstacles, and accepts no excuse from
anybody – not even his loved ones.
This ruthless and uncompromising outlook comes from the fact that Nathan faced the hardships of life at
an early age. He grew up poor, rising from poverty without anyone helping or supporting him. But despite
his current wealth and success, he is quick to realize that it is lonely at the top – and it is frustrating.
This is when he meets Dani Cobarrubias (Arci Muñoz), a spunky and outspoken 20-something who
Nathan eventually views as a kindred spirit. He allows himself to fall in love with her, and everything
seems to be perfect between them.

Noorjahan Kakon Bibi (, ) was a Bangladeshi freedom fighter and secret agent of the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. She was arrested and brutally tortured by the Pakistan army. She is one of two female freedom fighters honored with the Bir Protik award in 1996, the fourth highest honor in Bangladesh, due to her gallant contribution in the liberation war.
Personal life.
Noorjahan Kakon Bibi (originally named Kaket Hennyata, other sources state Kaket Hanchiata) was born in a Khasi family at Nayrai Khasia Palli, Meghalaya, India. Her sister was married to a member of the border guards. She married Shaheed Ali of Dirai village in 1970. After her marriage, her name was changed to Noorjahan Begum but she was mostly known as Kakon Bibi. She gave birth to a daughter, Sakhina, on 16 March 1971. Because of discrimination against girls in India, her husband was displeased and they got separated. Later she married Abdul Majid Khan, and they had a son who died at birth. Majid was living in EPR camp where he also worked. After two months, she brought Sakhina from her previous home. Upon returning, she couldn't find her husband. Hearing that Majid had been transferred to a camp of Dowarabazar Upazila, she went there.
Liberation war.
A war was happening in the Dowarabazar area when Kakon went there to search for her husband. She went to Tengratilla camp. The Pakistani Army captured her in a bunker and she faced inhuman physical and mental torture for many days. She lost hope of finding her husband and joined Muktibahini (the guerrilla resistance movement formed by the Bangladesh military, paramilitary and civilians during the War of Liberation). Freedom fighter Rahmat Ali introduced her to sector five commander, Mir Shawkat Ali. Shawkat called Kakon Bibi his sister of religion. With his influence, she started working as a secret agent under a disguise of a beggar.
In April 1971, Kakon Bibi was captured by the Razakars while spying in Bangla bazar in the region of Dowarabazar Upazila. They tortured her immensely including burning with a hot iron rod. Sexual torture was also intensified. Later, they took her to the Pakistani camp in Tengratilla. There, she told the Pakistani commander that she is the wife of Pakistani soldier Abdul Majid Khan and she came in search of him. The Pakistani commander believed her. Instead, she was proposed to work for the Pakistanis. She agreed and began to help freedom fighters providing information in a more effective way. This was primarily achieved through receiving an identification card from the Pakistani commander. With that ID card she started going to the Pakistani camp more often and with greater ease and supplied the freedom fighters with important information.
Later Kakon took part in nearly 20 battlefronts. In November, she was engaged in a front war in Tengratilla where she was deeply injured. The injury marks were visible on her knee till her death.
Death.
Kakon Bibi was hospitalised in 2017 after a heart attack. She died of pneumonia at Sylhet MAG Osmani Medical College and Hospital on 21 March 2018. At the time of her death, Kakon Bibi's age could not be verified. Reports range from 85 or 90 to an age of 103.

Frank McKinnon

Frank Lorne McKinnon, (June 16, 1934 – May 31, 2015) was a Canadian amateur sports administrator, executive, and coach. He was a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation Congress, chairman of the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA), and vice-president of the Canadian Olympic Association for one term. McKinnon was named a Member of the Order of Canada in June 2014 in recognition of his extensive volunteer work and contributions to amateur sport in Canada.
Career.
A teacher by trade, McKinnon received his post-secordary education at Brandon University, where he also starred on the school's hockey team. He became the principal of the high school in Carman, Manitoba in 1964 and later helped create the Manitoba High School Athletics Association, the governing body for high school athletics in the province. As the coach of Carman's high school hockey team, he once benched young star goaltender Ed Belfour, who went on to a Hall of Fame career in the National Hockey League.
McKinnon served on the board on the Manitoba Amateur Hockey Association (MAHA, now Hockey Manitoba) for 18 years (non-consecutive), five as president, during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. As an advocate for youth sports, McKinnon played a significant role in the overhaul of Canadian junior hockey and the creation of a national Junior "A" championship in 1970. McKinnon was Canada's representative at the IIHF Congress during the mid-1970s and a member of the organizing committee for the first IIHF World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in 1974.
McKinnon was elected to the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) executive in 1975, as the vice-president of senior international hockey. He then served as first vice-president of the CAHA from 1977 to 1979. When the CAHA created an elected board of governors and restructured the role of president to a full-time, salaried position in 1979, McKinnon and then-president Gord Renwick both declared they would not apply for the paid position. Murray Costello was hired as the president, and McKinnon was elected the first chairman of the board of governors in 1979. He was succeeded by Tubby Schmalz in May 1981, but returned to the chairman's role upon Schmalz's death in December 1981. McKinnon retired again as CAHA chairman in May 1982.
After retiring from his education career in 1992, McKinnon took on the role of Commissioner for the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL), a position he held until 2002.
Awards.
Hockey Canada, the Canadian Junior Hockey League, and several national and provincial sport bodies have bestowed McKinnon with their awards and honours, including Hockey Canada's highest award, the Order of Merit. The MJHL has created the Frank McKinnon Memorial Trophy and the Frank McKinnon Scholarship in his honour. McKinnon has also been honoured for his volunteer work in other sports, including an induction into the Manitoba Baseball Hall of Fame.
McKinnon was named a member of the Order of Canada by "His Excellency, the Right Honourable" David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, in 2014 and formally inducted in a ceremony shortly before his death in 2015.
Death.
McKinnon died in Calgary, Alberta on May 31, 2015 at the age of 80.

Diuris fragrantissima

Diuris fragrantissima, commonly called the fragrant doubletail or Sunshine diuris, is a species of orchid which is endemic to a small area to the west of Melbourne. It has two linear leaves at its base and up to twelve white flowers with mauve or pale purple markings with unusually long lateral sepals. Only about thirty plants survive in grassland near Sunshine.
Description.
"Diuris fragrantissima" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Up to twelve white flowers with mauve or pale purple markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, egg-shaped, long and wide. The lateral sepals are narrow lance-shaped, long, about wide, turned downwards at an angle and almost parallel to each other. The petals are erect or turned backwards with an elliptic or egg-shaped blade long and wide on a green stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is fan-shaped or heart-shaped, long, wide with a raised ridge along its midline and wrinkled edges. The side lobes are erect, irregularly shaped, long and about wide. There are two ridge-like calli long near the base of the mid-line of the base of the labellum. Flowering occurs in October and November.
Taxonomy and naming.
The fragrant doubletail was first formally described in 1964 by Alick Dockrill from an unpublished description by Herman Rupp and given the name "Diuris punctata" var. "albo-violacea". The description was published in "The Victorian Naturalist". In 1989 David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "D. fragrantissima" noting that it differs from "D. punctata" in "having a dwarf habit, the stiff, erect habit of the flowers that are white with purple markings, and its strong fragrance". The specific epithet ("fragrantissima") is the superlative form of the Latin word "fragrans" meaning "smelling agreeably".
Distribution and habitat.
At the time of European settlement, "D. fragrantissima" was plentiful in the grasslands to the west of Melbourne, but as early as 1934, W.H. Nicholls noted that it had become scarse. The population continued to decline until only one plant survived in the wild in 1992. About thirty wild plants of "Diuris fragrantissima" survive in grassland near Sunshine and others have been introduced to a small reserve near Altona. The populations at both Sunshine and Altona are under great stress due to the encroachment of industrial and residential development. Ecological processes such as the loss of natural pollinators also threaten this species. About 200 individuals survive in cultivation, mostly at Melbourne Zoo and the Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria.
Conservation.
"Diuris fragrantissima" is classified as "endangered" under the Australian government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" and the Victorian government "Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act 1988". The main threats to the species are weed invasion, predation, especially by the introduced house mouse ("Mus musculus"), altered fire regimes and human interference.

MIR1250 (gene)

MicroRNA 1250 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MIR1250 gene.
Function.
microRNAs (miRNAs) are short (20-24 nt) non-coding RNAs that are involved in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in multicellular organisms by affecting both the stability and translation of mRNAs. miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II as part of capped and polyadenylated primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs) that can be either protein-coding or non-coding. The primary transcript is cleaved by the Drosha ribonuclease III enzyme to produce an approximately 70-nt stem-loop precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), which is further cleaved by the cytoplasmic Dicer ribonuclease to generate the mature miRNA and antisense miRNA star (miRNA*) products. The mature miRNA is incorporated into a RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which recognizes target mRNAs through imperfect base pairing with the miRNA and most commonly results in translational inhibition or destabilization of the target mRNA. The RefSeq represents the predicted microRNA stem-loop. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2009].

Norman Samuel Crookes (born 15 November 1935) is a former cricketer who played first-class cricket in South Africa from 1962 to 1970. 
Norman Crookes was an off-spinner and useful lower-order batsman for Natal. On his first-class debut, in the Currie Cup in 1962-63, he took 5 for 62 and 2 for 48 in Natal's victory over Western Province. He was a steady performer over the next three seasons. His most significant performance was for a South African Colts XI against the touring MCC early in the 1964-65 season, when in difficult circumstances caused by illness to several of the team he scored 60 and 25 and took 2 for 66 and 5 for 102 and almost brought off a surprise victory.
He was selected as one of the three spin bowlers for the tour of England in 1965. Despite taking more wickets in the matches outside the Tests than any other bowler, he did not play in the three Tests. He took 2 for 94 and 8 for 47 in the victory over Middlesex and 5 for 54 and 3 for 47 in the victory over Lancashire, and finished the tour with 47 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 19.44.

Deepavali (1960 film)

Deepavali () is a 1960 Telugu-language Hindu mythological film, produced by K. Gopala Rao under the Aswaraja Pictures banner and directed by S. Rajinikanth. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Savitri and music composed by Ghantasala. This is third film of N. T. Rama Rao as Lord Krishna. The film is a box hit and celebrated 100 days, despite releasing only 6 days after Bhatti vikramarka. It was dubbed in 1974 in Kannada as Narakasura Vadhe,
Plot.
The film begins with Narakasura born to Bhoodevi (Savitri) and Lord Vishnu (N. T. Rama Rao) during the time of "Varaha Avatar", a wild boar form. Narakasura (S. V. Ranga Rao) conquers the entire world and makes Prakjothishapuram as his capital. He also wants to conquer heaven, so, he does penance for Lord Siva and gets a boon that except for his mother Bhoodevi, no one else can kill him. Narakasura then wins over the entire universe and takes Deva Maata Aditi Devi's (Rushyendramani) earrings and all heavenly ladies to his capital in a procession. Nagadatta (Gummadi) is a citizen at Prakjothishapuram and a great devotee of Lord Vishnu. Unfortunately, his son comes into the procession and dies under a chariot. Nagadatta opposes the cruelty of Narakasura and he is arrested. In spite of Nagadatta's daughter, Vasumathi (S. Varalakshmi) requests Narakasura to keep a deaf ear. Distressed, Vasumathi bangs her head to Siva's idol and she is cursed by a Saint to become a snake. When she explains to him about her condition, the Saint tells him she can take revenge on Narakasura in snake form. Nagadatta escapes from jail and reaches Dwaraka along with Vasumathi, where Lord Vishnu has taken birth as Lord Krishna. Narakasura comes to know regarding this, in disguise, he reaches Dwaraka, marries Vasumathi by cheating and takes them back. Narakasura imprisons Nagadatta again. Vasumathi realizes that she is married to Narakasura, but she turns obedient to him. Narakasura's atrocities increase day by day by which both gods and humans are suffering. Narada (Kanta Rao) reaches the earth and requests Krishna to put an end to it and restore peace, but he replies that he can't do so because of his word, which was given to Bhoodevi.
Meanwhile, Vasumathi gives birth to Bhagadatta. Vasumati tells her father that she will make his son as a devotee to Lord Krishna. Listening to this, Narakasura becomes angry and arrests Vasumathi too. Krishna appears to Nagadatta in the prison and is caught by soldiers. Krishna then transforms himself into Narada and develops devotion towards Krishna among soldiers. Meanwhile, Satyabhama could not find Krishna in the palace, she accuses Narada that he is trying to separate Krishna from her. Krishna comes there and tells her about Narakasura's misdeeds and orders Narada to observe his actions. Narakasura comes to Dwaraka in Krishna's attire and takes away all the girls from there. The public suspects Krishna and they plead to Satyabhama for their daughters. Krishna tells her that it is the atrocity of Narakasura. Satyabhama says that they have to take revenge over this. At the same time, Nagadatta escapes with Vasumathi. Narakasura catches them and removes Nagadatta's eyes. Narada takes him to Krishna. Every one requests Krishna to see the end of Narakasura. Krishna starts for war. Vasumathi obstructs Narakasura and he runs a chariot over her. Satyabhama accompanies Krishna in war. During the time of war, Krishna pretends as if he has fainted. Then Satyabhama takes the arrow and grounds Narakasura. Then he realizes that Satyabhama is none other than his mother Bhoodevi. Satyabhama requests Krishna to make Narakasura's name permanent then Krishna says that on the day when Narakasura realized his soul, people will celebrate Deepavali by lighting the lamps.

Pasture wedge graph

A pasture wedge graph or feed wedge is a farm management tool used by dairy farmers for the purposes of managing pasture. It takes the form of a bar graph, that shows the amount of feed available in a pasture over time, and is therefore shaped as a declining wedge.
Rotational grazing systems have developed on temperate pastures consisting of perennial ryegrass and white clover. The pre-grazing pasture mass and the post-grazing residual (1500 kg/DM/ha) are critical decisions the dairy farmer has to make every day. The development of the 'Rising Plate Meter' has enabled the pre-grazing and post-grazing pasture masses to be measured.· Pasture eaten, measured as megajoules of metabolisable energy per hectare (MJME/ha) or as kilograms of dry matter (kg DM/ha), is a key driver of profit for all farm systems i.e. pasture grown x pasture utilisation.
History and development.
Tom Phillips (New Zealand Dairy Board consulting officer, Matamata, New Zealand, 1976) developed the original concept of the pasture wedge graph used worldwide by pasture based dairy farmers. The original goal of the NZ Dairy Board consulting officer team (Sir Arthur Ward) was to assist New Zealand dairy farmers improve profitability by improving pasture grazing management and the genetic quality of the herd. In 1950-2000 the NZ dairy industry was based on low-input, pasture-based, spring calving systems. Consulting officers worked primarily with dairy farmers in Discussion Groups. Tom Phillips was a consulting officer from 1976 to 1983 (Waikato/Bay of Plenty area) based in Matamata. The legacy of this on farm collaboration in 1976 is that the concept of the pasture wedge graph is used today by pasture based/grazing dairy farmers throughout the world. It has evolved into an online predictive computerized tool for tactical farm management decision making regarding grazing management.
Development in New Zealand.
Much of the basic grazing management in New Zealand was developed from the original work of André Voisin
(1957) in Normandy, France on the theory of rotational grazing. Decades of farmlet trials at Ruakura comparing controlled grazing (rotational grazing) vs uncontrolled (set stocking) led by McMeekan created multi-year farm systems experimentation into core fundamentals of grazing management with dairy cows. Temperate permanent pastures were found to respond best to a hard grazing (post grazing residual of 1500kgs DM/ha) and then being spelled before being hard grazed again. The grazing interval depended on the time of year and the speed of the regrowth after grazing. Each grazing impacted on the subsequent quality of the pasture grown
The original pasture wedge graph concept attempted to include a number of rotational grazing concepts. e.g. Graze the longer pasture first, don't let the longest pasture exceed 15–25 cm, allocated pasture area so that the dairy cows graze to a residual of 1500kgs DM/ha (2–4 cm) within a single grazing i.e. 12 or 24 hrs. Maintain pasture in a leafy stage of growth so that the quality is high (high energy &amp; protein). In this way both perennial ryegrass and white clover thrive and the cows achieve the maximum pasture intake. Pasture management has a demand (cow intake X pasture area) and a supply (available pasture) component. In 2005 Adrian Van Bysterveldt made a mathematical assessment of the required pasture demand for the pasture wedge graph. This effectively put numbers on the graph and enabled dairy farmers to calculate a demand line (for the grazing herd) and provide measurements of the amount of pasture available to be grazed (supply) on the farm. A simple spreadsheet could now create a graph for the farmer to allow informed decisions to be made, particularly about the grazing interval or rotation length.
Grazing management has moved from allocating a certain amount of pasture area each day to a better understanding of the needs of the pasture plant and the interaction between the animal and the plant.
The Rising Plate Meter was designed in New Zealand to measure both height &amp; density of perennial ryegrass and white clover pastures under dairying.

Mudéjar theme park

Mudéjar Theme Park is a miniature park located in Olmedo, Valladolid, in the Castilla y León area of Spain. It contains 21 scale models of buildings of Castile and Leon, including castles and churches that were constructed in the Mudéjar style. The models are generally built to a scale of either 1:6 or 1:8. Mudéjar is an architectural style unique to Spain in which the basic attributes of both Muslim Moorish and Christian Gothic architecture are combined to form a hybrid style. It was popular in medieval Spain after the Reconquista.
History.
The park was inaugurated in 1999.
Description.
The park has a total area of almost . The largest attraction is the scale-model castle of La Mota, on display since April 2003, which is estimated to contain the same number of bricks as the original castle, a total of 2,500,000. The park model covers and rises to a height of . Other important buildings featured as models are the Castle of Coca in Segovia and the Valladolid churches of Pozáldez and San Andrés de Olmedo, as well as Fresno el Viejo and San Pedro de Alcázarén. 
Apart from the miniature models of buildings, miniature trains run through the park; these are constructed to the scale of 1:22.5. There are also two lakes, a pond with fountains, and a playground for children. The park contains models of the rivers Adaja and the Eresma. The artificial rivers run through the park just as the real ones run through the Spanish countryside. The park also contains more than 300 species of plants. 
Mudéjar Theme Park is one of the most visited sites in Olmedo.

Myponie Point

Myponie Point (also known as Tickera Point) is a geographical feature in the locality of Wallaroo Plain, 10 kilometres north of Wallaroo in South Australia.
The area is dominated by sloping bedrock and its shoreline mounts 10 to 20 metre high bluffs and steep gullies. Adjacent properties have been cleared for agricultural use. Several coastal shacks are present, and the area is used by rock and boat-based fishers. It is considered unsafe for swimming owing to its rockiness.
Prospective port site.
Myponie Point has been a prospective port site since 2002, when adjacent land was acquired by a syndicate of farmers and later the Australian Wheat Board for the purpose of developing new grain export facilities. Such facilities were never constructed. In the 2010s, Myponie Point was selected by the Braemar Alliance as their preferred location for an offshore floating port to facilitate future mineral exports. The project was declared a Major Project by the Government of South Australia in 2013. The project is intended to provide an export pathway for bulk commodities from developing mines located between Peterborough (SA) and Broken Hill (NSW).
Prior to its identification as a prospective port site, Myponie Point was occasionally visited by local scouting groups.

De'Anthony Melton

De'Anthony Melton (born May 28, 1998) is an American professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected by the Houston Rockets in the second round of the 2018 NBA draft with the 46th pick, but was traded to Phoenix before his rookie season began. He played college basketball for the USC Trojans of the Pac-12 Conference, but did not play in the 2017–18 season due to the events relating to the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal.
High school career.
Melton attended Crespi Carmelite High School in Encino, California. As a three-star recruit, he committed to the USC Trojans on November 20, 2015.
College career.
Freshman year.
Melton played in 36 games, starting in the last 25 games of the season that year. He averaged 8.3 points, 3.5 assists, 4.7 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game. On January 25, in an 84–76 win over future #2 pick Lonzo Ball and UCLA, Melton had 13 points, 9 rebounds, 5 assists, 4 steals, and a block. He followed this performance with a 16-point, 7 rebound, 6 assist, 6 steal, and 2 block game against future #1 pick Markelle Fultz and Washington on February 1.
Melton became the first freshman to record at least 300 points, 150 rebounds, 100 assists, 60 steals, and 35 blocks in their starting season since Dwyane Wade. As a result of those starts, he was projected to be a key player for USC's upcoming season.
Sophomore year.
On September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against 10 people involved in college basketball, including USC assistant coach Tony Bland. The charges allege that Bland and other members involved allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services. Following the announcement, USC indefinitely suspended Melton in relation to the scandal due to a family member's involvement there. On February 21, 2018, Melton announced he would withdraw from USC and declare for the 2018 NBA draft.
Professional career.
Phoenix Suns (2018–2019).
Melton was selected with the 46th pick by the Houston Rockets in the 2018 NBA draft. He played for the Rockets during the 2018 NBA Summer League in Las Vegas. In five games, Melton recorded 16.4 points, 7.2 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 3.0 steals per game. His best game during the event was on July 9 where he made 26 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 assists in a 104–90 win over the Los Angeles Clippers. On August 31, Melton was traded alongside Ryan Anderson to the Phoenix Suns in exchange for Brandon Knight and Marquese Chriss. Melton signed his first NBA contract with the Suns on September 21. He made his professional debut with the Suns on October 22, 2018, in a 123–103 loss to the Golden State Warriors, but did not record significant playing time until October 31 in a 120–90 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. Melton was assigned to the Northern Arizona Suns, Phoenix's development team in the NBA G League, for their first game of the season on November 3, 2018. He played the one game, a 118–108 loss to the Santa Cruz Warriors, and was recalled to Phoenix the next day.
On December 4, Melton recorded a professional high of 21 points in a 122–105 loss to the Sacramento Kings. He also recorded season-high 10 assists in a 102–93 win over the Denver Nuggets on January 12, 2019. Melton shined on the defensive end of the court as well as put his playmaking skills on display in the Suns victory against the Sacramento Kings on January 8. Melton scored 10 points with eight assists, four rebounds, four steals and two blocks in the win. Melton later suffered a right ankle sprain on January 24, leaving him out of action for close to a month before returning briefly for the NBA G League on February 20, and then played in the NBA proper three days later against the Atlanta Hawks. On March 16, Melton recorded a career-high 8 rebounds in a 138–136 overtime win over the New Orleans Pelicans.
Melton was 2nd in the NBA in rookie steals in 2018–19 with 1.36 spg. When Melton is on the floor, he recorded steals more frequently than any other player in the NBA, ranking 1st with 3.3 steals per 100 possessions (min. 700 total minutes played). Among rookies to start in majority of their appearances, Melton's 3.3 steals per 100 possessions are tied for 6th most all-time in Basketball-Reference's database.
Memphis Grizzlies (2019–present).
On July 7, 2019, the Suns traded Melton, Josh Jackson, and two second round picks to the Memphis Grizzlies in exchange for Jevon Carter and Kyle Korver. On November 22, 2020, the Memphis Grizzlies announced that they had re-signed Melton to a multi-year contract.

Anna van Westerstee Beek

Anna Beek née Anna van Westerstee (25 November 1657, The Hague - after October 1717, The Hague), was a Dutch publisher of maps. 
Career.
Most of the maps she produced are city and battle plans, which are mapping naval and ground troop movements. The War of the Spanish Succession began in 1701 and the majority of the maps she sold were of key moments, providing news of events in real time. She married the publisher and art dealer Barent Beek in 1678, but after a 15-year marriage and having seven children together, her spouse deserted her. She later divorced him and the local courts supported her running the family business. Since at least 1697 she often used her maiden name "Van Westerstee" again. Several reference books consider her the engraver of some of the works she published.
Thirty maps produced by Beek are part of the Geography and Map Division's collection at the U.S. Library of Congress.

ASEA (American company)

ASEA is a privately owned international direct selling and multi-level marketing company founded in 2007 and headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. It has previously been known as Medical Immune Research, Inc. and ASEA, Inc.
History.
ASEA was founded by Verdis Norton and Tyler Norton. The current management consists of Charles F. Funke as the CEO and Jarom Webb as the President.
The company officially launched in 2009. Currently, it has approximately 30,000 active associates. In 2013, ASEA, LLC moved its operations to a 33,000 square foot production facility which produces 15,000 cases of ASEA a week.
Product.
ASEA's first product was a liquid supplement initially also named ASEA, and currently known as ASEA Redox Supplement. In 2014, RENU 28, a skin revitalization gel product, was added to its product lineup.
Medical doctor Harriett Hall has written about the effectiveness of the dietary supplement ASEA several times on the Science-Based Medicine website and notes that "... there are testimonials galore; but there is no acceptable published evidence to confirm that it has any health benefits in humans."
While the primary ingredients created in the original MDI-P solution are found in the current ASEA Redox Supplement and RENU 28 products, the processes and outputs differ. All prior patents from the previous company have expired. New patents that cover the proprietary composition and production processes used to produce ASEA and RENU 28 have been filed and issued.
In 2015, ASEA partnered with BioAgilytix Labs to work in unison with their internal product teams to monitor the quality of the manufacturing process and give the scientific validity of the nature of the products. Specializing in biomarker testing, BioAfilytix validates the existence of reactive oxygen in the product. To maintain the BioAgilytix certification, ASEA provides a weekly product sampling for a scientific assay to substantiate the existence of reactive oxygen molecules in ASEA redox products and for product quality.
In 2016, ASEA announced the launch of a new skincare line, RENU Advanced, consisting of four products against anti-aging.
History.
ASEA is based on technology developed and patented by Medical Discoveries, Inc, a publicly traded company (MLSC). MDI-P was a clear, colorless liquid generated by electrolysis of a sterile saline. It contained highly reactive chlorine and oxygen species, including HOCl, OCl−, Cl−, Cl2, and O3. It was tested for its microbicidal properties and was found effective against "Staphylococcus aureus", "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", "Legionella pneumophila", and "Candida albicans" and is considered to be a very fast-acting, broad-spectrum microbicidal solution. While the primary ingredients created in the original MDI-P solution are found in the current ASEA Redox Supplement and RENU 28 products, the processes and outputs differ. All prior patents from the previous company have expired. New patents that cover the proprietary composition and production processes used to produce ASEA and RENU 28 have been filed and issued.
MDI went up for sale in 2007, and Verdis Norton, who sat on the board at the time, decided to gather other investors and purchase the technology. They made the decision to create a consumable product in a liquid form that could be classified as a supplement.
Norton and his partners funded research to differentiate the new product from its pharmaceutical-grade predecessor into something consumable, believing that recreating redox signaling molecules outside the human body and producing them in a consumable product would optimize cellular function and overall health and wellness.
Under the company name of ASEA, they began selling the product in 2009 with an official launch in 2010. Currently, ASEA has approximately 30,000 active associates. In 2013, ASEA, LLC moved its manufacturing operations to a 33,000 square-foot production facility, which is FDA registered, NSF certified, and GMP compliant and produces 15,000 cases of ASEA Redox Supplement per week.
In May 2016, ASEA launched a new skincare line, RENU Advanced. With four products bundled as a skincare system, RENU Advanced is formulated for anti-aging and is based on ASEA's flagship technology of redox signaling.
Assessing effectiveness.
A double blinded and placebo controlled study of 20 participants was performed to assess the effectiveness of cyclists completing time trials (TT). The abstract found that "ASEA did not improve TT performance".
ASEA has funded a study completed by Tauret Labs in which it completed a double blinded and placebo controlled study on 60 participants. It found that "Additional analysis did identify at least 5 genes that may have interesting differential expression in the test group and were not significant in placebo or control groups". However due to the small sample size and short length of the study it was noted "Confirmation of these findings may be further substantiated by a longer study time with larger cohorts of participants."
Physician Harriet Hall has reviewed the scientific literature related to the assessment of ASEA as a dietary supplement, noting that there is no acceptable published evidence to confirm that it has any health benefits in humans. The conclusions of Harriet Hall were supported by Science Based Medicine. Similar conclusions were drawn by "Does It Really Work".
Legal issues.
In its press release on 10 March 2014, the Italian Competition Authority sanctioned 3 companies "for unfair business practices". One of them was ASEA Italy which was fined €150,000. According to the Antitrust case, "consumers are proposed to purchase products through mechanisms aimed in reality at recruiting other sellers who are asked for an initial contribution or a subscription to a programme of personal purchases ... It is a distributive mechanism considered incorrect by the Consumer Code for which the consumer cannot make a contribution in exchange for the opportunity to receive compensation that is derived primarily from the introduction of other consumers into the scheme rather than from the sale or consumption of products." It alleged that the position of Asea Italy is further aggravated by the fact that the company has attributed to their products curative properties that are not adequately substantiated and certified.

Titus Vitrasius Pollio (consul 137)

Titus Vitrasius Pollio was a Roman senator, who held a number of offices in the imperial service. He was suffect consul around the year 137. 
The "cursus honorum" of Pollio is known from diverse sources. The tombstone of a soldier of Legio VII Gemina, which mentions Pollio as "legatus legionis" or commander of the unit, also mentions the consul Marcus Junius Homullus; since Homullus' "nundinium" as suffect consul has been dated to 128, Pollio's commission in the legion either was in that year or after. Pollio is also known to have been governor of the imperial province of Gallia Lugdunensis at the end of Hadrian's reign, although he could have held that office before or after his command of Legio VII.
One definite date in Pollio's life comes after his consulate, when the sortition awarded him the proconsular governorship of Asia, which he held for the term 151/152. During his tenure, he had to intervene in a protracted legal suit between the sophist Aelius Aristides and the inhabitants of Smyrna who had been nominating him to various civic posts that Prof. G.W. Bowersock described as "laden with honor, time-consuming, and expensive." The specific civic honor the Smyrnans wanted Aristides to accept was "eklogeus", who was responsible for arrears in taxes; the assistant to the governor of Asia had confirmed Aristides' appointment. Aristides responded by appealing to Pollio, who saw that his assistant altered his confirmation, thus allowing Aristides to once again avoid his civic responsibilities.
Pollio must have married, although we are ignorant of his wife's name, for Titus Pomponius Proculus Vitrasius Pollio, consul in 176, is identified as his son.

America (Thirty Seconds to Mars album)

America (stylized in uppercase) is the fifth studio album by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, released on April 6, 2018 through Interscope Records. It is their first album in five years, after "Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams" (2013)"," as well as their first release for Interscope, following the band's departure from Virgin Records in 2014. It is also the final album by the band to feature lead guitarist Tomo Miličević, who left the band two months after its release.
Produced by frontman Jared Leto alongside Yellow Claw, Zedd, Robopop, and others, the album represents a drastic shift from the experimental compositions of their previous efforts, opting for an electronic and art pop influenced sound. Lyrically, it is a concept album exploring themes such as politics, sex, and fame. The album was promoted with three singles – "Walk on Water", "Dangerous Night", and "Rescue Me" – in addition to the Monolith Tour and an accompanying documentary film, "A Day in the Life of America" (2019).
The album received polarized reviews from critics. Some commended the conceptual themes, while others felt that they were not fully developed; critics were also divided over the band's change in sound. Upon its release, "America" debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" 200, becoming the band's highest entry on the chart, and reached the top five in several other countries.
Background.
Thirty Seconds to Mars released their fourth studio album "Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams" in May 2013. The album, produced by frontman Jared Leto and previous collaborator Steve Lillywhite, marked a shift in the band's musical direction from an alternative rock sound, recognized with "A Beautiful Lie" (2005) and "This Is War" (2009), to a more experimental and electronic-influenced sound. The band parted ways with Virgin Records in 2014 after tumultuous years with the label, and later signed with Interscope.
The group began preparations for new music in November 2015, with Leto expressing his desire to experiment and explore new musical grounds. Additionally, Leto started working on the documentary film "A Day in the Life of America", which was conceived as a companion piece to the band's fifth album. The film includes user-submitted footage from July 4, 2017, depicting Independence Day in the United States. It was released in January 2021 on PBS after premiering at the 2019 Tribeca Film Festival. The band later embarked on a promotional tour with Muse and PVRIS, which was one of the highest-grossing North American tours of 2017, according to "Pollstar"s annual year-end tour chart.
While touring, Thirty Seconds to Mars announced "Walk on Water" as the lead single from the album. Critics acknowledged a slight political edge in the song's lyrics, inspired by the election of Donald Trump as President of the United States. The song earned the band an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Alternative. While collecting the award, Jared Leto made a remark at Trump's immigration policy as he stated, "We are Americans – a land of immigrants – and we just want to say that we welcome you with open arms and with open hearts, and we love you."
Promotion.
"America" was first announced by the band in February 2018 under a placeholder name, alongside the North American leg of The Monolith Tour. Tickets for the tour, including the previously-announced European leg, were sold with a copy of the album, to be delivered upon its release on April 6, 2018. A presale of tickets were offered to people that had pre-ordered the album before February 12. "America" was officially unveiled by the band and Interscope Records on March 22, 2018. It was unveiled with an advertising campaign featuring billboards and posters reproducing the album's art direction and design. Billboards were located at landmark locations such as Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles, New York City's Times Square, and outside of a number of London Underground stations. A listening session for the album took place on April 3 at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum in Cleveland.
Singles.
On August 22, 2017, Interscope released "Walk on Water" as the lead single promoting the then-unannounced fifth studio album by the band. The song was performed live for the first time at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards on August 27 with Travis Scott as a special surprise guest. A music video for the song premiered on Vevo on November 8, 2017, featuring footage from the documentary film "A Day in the Life of America". "Walk on Water" was used by ESPN as the promotional theme for the network's coverage of the 2017 College Football season.
"Dangerous Night" was released as the second single from the album on January 25, 2018, after it premiered on Zane Lowe's radio show of Beats 1 in London. The band debuted the song live the same day at "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert". Their performance was filmed through the use of advanced robotic cameras which changed frame following the beat of the track, and featured an interpretive dancer. Nicholas Rice from "Billboard" commended the band's performance, praising its visuals and calling it "one-of-a-kind".
"Rescue Me" was released as the third single from the album on June 15, 2018. The official music video premiered three days earlier. On May 27, 2018, the band were joined on stage by Shawn Mendes to perform the song at BBC Music's Biggest Weekend.
Packaging.
The art direction and design for the album were handled by Willo Perron and Jared Leto. "America" features multiple album covers featuring an array of lists of words that reflect the themes of the album, including the most prescribed drugs, iconic American names, the most valuable trademarks, popular sex positions, recognizable abbreviated agencies, most dangerous sports, highest paid YouTubers and generally hot topics of discussion. Thirty Seconds to Mars also launched a custom album cover generator allowing fans to create their own custom lists in the format of the "America" album cover. Leto explained, "For me the lists are almost like a time capsule. Independently they may surprise, entertain or provoke, but as a group they give us a sense of the culture we are a part of and the times we are living in."
Critical reception.
"America" received polarized reviews from music critics. Many commentators commended the album's conceptual execution, while others believed that its underlying concept was not fully developed. Critics also debated the stylistic change in the band's sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 47 based on four reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Neil Z. Yeung from AllMusic described "America" as a "bold and risky move" from the band, calling it as "vast and polarizing" as the country after which it is named. Katie Wattendorf, writing for "The Cavalier Daily", gave "America" a positive review, praising the album's concept and calling it "as diverse as the country itself". She commented that the album addresses recent history in the United States not just "by mentioning the political climate, or the violence, or the technology takeover — but by posing a solution in the form of unity through differences, cohesion through variety". Aneta Grulichova from "The Music" magazine awarded the album four stars out of five and praised the band's stylistic change, noting that the record incorporates a softer sound as well as elements from techno.
"Spin"'s Al Shipley, who gave the album a mixed review, felt that the energy and volume found in the band's signature style was replaced with "fairly tame looped and programmed beats and ominous synths", although he praised the song "Rider", describing it as "a rare glimpse at a Thirty Seconds to Mars that's willing to subvert expectations". Both "Q" and "Kerrang!" gave "America" a mixed review, with the former calling the album "unsubtle, self-important and not half as good as it thinks it is", while the latter called it "an odd album, one that requires patience to unlock." In a four-and-a-half star review, Ethan Gerling of "The Reflector" wrote that the album functions as a "conversation on the current state of America and its culture" without making extreme political statements, and praised the musical diversity, writing that the band "struck gold with their experimental digging style" in the album.

The 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier was the tournament played as part of qualification process for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.
Twelve regional qualifiers were held by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with 62 teams competed during 2018 in five regions – Africa (3 groups), Americas (2), Asia (2), East Asia Pacific (2) and Europe (3). The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier., along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship.
The first Asian sub-regional qualifier was held in Kuwait from 20 to 27 April 2018. The second sub-regional qualifier took place in Malaysia between 3 and 12 October 2018.

Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals will be played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
From the Western sub-region group, the United Arab Emirates were the first team to qualify for the regional final. They were joined by Qatar and Kuwait. From the Eastern sub-region group, Nepal, Singapore and Malaysia qualified for the regional final. However, in March 2019, the ICC announced that the UAE would host the qualifier tournament. Later the same month, the ICC released the match schedule for all the Regional Finals, with the UAE omitted from the Asia Regional Final. The number of teams that could qualify from the Asia Regional Final was also reduced from two to one.

Bo Weevil

"Bo Weevil" is a song written by Dave Bartholomew and Fats Domino, recorded by Domino in 7 November 1955 and released as a single in January 1956, peaking at number 35 on the U.S. pop chart and number 5 on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in February 1956. It was featured on his 1956 album, "Rock and Rollin' with Fats Domino".
Alternate versions.
In 1991, two new versions of the song performed by Fats Domino were released: the so-called "complete" (length 2:45), on the soundtrack of the film "A Rage in Harlem", and the "alternative" (1:50), on the 4-CD box set "They Call Me The Fat Man...". The "complete" version was also included in the 1993 Fats Domino box set "Out of New Orleans". However, these alternate versions are simply composite edits of the original recording, the shortest of the three (1:50), which was considered as alternative by Fats Domino fans. The first minute of this original recording (after a two-second intro) was repeated twice to produce a composite master for the single and album (2:02). The long so-called "complete" version is a triple repetition of the same first minute with a fade-out at the end.

Jeongye Daewongun

Jeongye Daewongun (Hangul: 전계대원군; Hanja: 全溪大院君; 21 March 1785 – 2 November 1841; ) was a member of the Korean Joseon dynasty as the biological father of King Cheoljong of Joseon. His personal name was Yi Gwang (hangul: 이광; hanja: 李㼅), but he was also known as Kwae-deuk (hangul: 쾌득; hanja: 快得) or Hae-dong (hangul: 해동; hanja: 海東).
Early life.
Yi Gwang was born on March 21, 1785, in Ganghwa-do. His birth name was Kwae-deuk, which later changed to Hae-dong and after some years to Gwang.
He was one of several illegitimate sons of Prince Euneon and the second of two sons of Lady Yi of the Jeonsan Yi clan. His older full-brother had an early death.
His legitimate eldest half-brother was Prince Sanggye, also known as Crown Prince Wanpung, who was an adopted son of Jeongjo of Joseon and heir to the throne for a short time, in 1779.
His father, Prince Euneon, was an illegitimate son of Crown Prince Sado by his concubine, Royal Noble Consort Suk of the Buan Im clan; Sado himself was an illegitimate son of King Yeongjo of Joseon. This made Jeongye the half-nephew of King Jeongjo, but during his life, he did not receive the treatment of a member of the Royal Family.
In 1801, Prince Euneon was executed after his legitimate wife, Princess Consort Sangsan of the Jincheon Song clan and his daughter-in-law, Princess Consort Shin of the Pyeongsan Shin clan (the wife of Prince Sanggye), had been baptized into the Roman Catholic Church. The Joseon Dynasty's state religion was Neo-Confucianism, so Princess Sangsan, Prince Euneon and Princess Shin were executed for treason.
Some of Prince Euneon's sons, including Yi Gwang, were exiled on Ganghwa Island where they lived as poor farmers, but in 1822 the family received a special pardon from King Sunjo.
On November 2, 1841, Grand Internal Prince Jeongye died at his home in Gyeonghaeng, Hanseong, at the age of 56. The cause of death is unknown.
After death.
In August 1841, the Noron faction plotted a coup d'état in order to crown Yi Won-gyeong, Yi Gwang's eldest child and only legitimate son as the new King. However, the plot was detected, which led to the execution of Yi Won-gyeong. The sole survivors were Yi Gwang's two illegitimate sons, Yi Gyeong-eung and Yi Won-beom, who were again exiled to Ganghwa-do.
In 1849, his son, Yi Won-beom, born to a concubine named Lady Yeom, became the new monarch of Joseon as King Cheoljong. The title "Daewongun" was posthumously conferred on Prince Jeongye, making his full name Jeongye Daewongun.
His tomb was originally in Jingwan, Eunpyeong-gu, Seoul, northwest of his father, Prince Euneon's grave, but it was moved to Yeoju, and in August 1851, to Seondan-ri, Pocheon-eup, near Wangbang Mountain.

Porthcawl railway station

Porthcawl railway station served the seaside resort of Porthcawl in South Wales. It closed in 1963.
History.
Rail activity began in Porthcawl in 1825, when the Duffryn Llynfi &amp; Porthcawl Railway (actually a tramway) began construction, opening in 1828. Built to a gauge of four feet and seven inches and using rails based on stone sleepers, it was intended for it to serve a projected new port for the transfer of minerals from South Wales. It ran from Duffryn Llynfi near Maesteg via Tondu and Pyle. It was extended to Bridgend in 1834. The South Wales Railway, which passed through both Bridgend and Pyle, opened in 1850. The Llynfi Valley Railway took over the original company in 1847, and upgraded both the former tramway branches, reopening them as broad gauge railways on 10 August 1861. The Llynfi Valley Railway merged with the Ogmore Valley Railway in 1866, creating the Llynfi &amp; Ogmore Railway. Despite the conversion to a railway, trains on the Porthcawl branch continued to be drawn by horses until 1868, when the system was altered again, this time to standard gauge. The new Llynfi &amp; Ogmore Railway was taken over by the Great Western Railway in 1873.
By the early 20th Century, Porthcawl grew in importance as a destination for holiday traffic, and in 1916, the GWR rebuilt the station. Despite the fact that it had been built a mile nearer to the seafront, the new station was not universally popular; the building was a rather insubstantial structure built of wood and asbestos, and whilst the original station had possessed a footbridge, the GWR did not supply one for the new station, despite the rise from two to three platforms. Passengers using the remoter platforms were obliged to make a long detour via a link at the end of the platforms. A special gate was provided at the end of the departure platform for the use of day-trippers. The original station's turntable was not replaced, but remained derelict on-site for many years. In the decades following the opening of the new station, passenger numbers remained high, with around 70,000 passengers using the station.
The closure came in 1963 despite the fact that the branch was still well-used, and the move was very unpopular with local businesses and residents alike. Poor ticket sales from Porthcawl station itself were used to justify the closure, but the fact that most travelers bought their tickets "to", rather than from Porthcawl (the ticket sale therefore recorded elsewhere) was ignored. The trackbed is occupied by a road. The station building is used by the Porthcawl branch of the Sea Cadets.

The following year, 1931, the Women's Billiards Association was formed: Gardner was one of the four professional players appointed to a committee to organise the professional championships, the others were Margaret Lennan, Eva Collins and Ruth Harrison. It was agreed that the Association would take over the running of the competition as a world championship, with the same trophy as used in 1930.
Her of 96 in the 1930 final was the first break by a woman to receive a certificate of recognition from the Billiards Association and Control Council. and she made the first break in the competition, a 100 in 1934.
Gardner was also runner-up six times, so appeared in a total of 13 finals in the 14 times the event was staged. The only year that she was not in the final was 1940, when she was beaten by Thelma Carpenter in the semi-final.
Gardner's highest break at billiards was 318, and at snooker it was 82.

It was reported that Joyce tutored the latter film's star Frankie Howerd who in the film "has a number of hair-raising interludes in a London billiards saloon".
She continued playing until her late sixties and became the only woman member of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association.

Platylestes platystylus

Platylestes platystylus or Green-eyed Spreadwing is a damselfly species in the family Lestidae. Although this species appears to be widespread, there are very few recent records. This species is known from old records from West Bengal in India, Myanmar (Fraser 1933), Thailand (Hämäläinen and Pinratana 1999) and Laos (Yokoi 2001). There are recent records from Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Kerala, South India.
Description and habitat.
It is a small dull colored damselfly of the size of "Lestes". Its prothorax and thorax are in palest khaki brown color, paler at the sides and pruinosed white beneath. There are a large number of black spots on the thorax. Its wings are palely enfumed with short and broad pterostigma having white or pale inner and outer ends. Its abdomen is in olivaceous to warm reddish brown in color with black apical rings on each segments. Anal appendages are whitish with the superiors black at base, curling in at apices to meet each other. Inferior appendages are about half the length and thick at base.
Female closely resembles the male in most respects, differing mainly in sexual characters. Anal appendages are yellow, blackish brown at the base, and as long as segment 10.
The small black spots on each side of thorax and quadrate pterostigma with white at both ends are the most distinguishing features of this damselfly compared to other spreadwings.

Exercise Kangaroo

Exercise Kangaroo was a joint warfare exercise that was held by the Australian Defence Force in the 1970s and 1980s.
The first iteration of Exercise Kangaroo took place in 1974. The military units involved included the aircraft carrier HMAS Melbourne (R21), which took part in the exercise in the Coral Sea, before returning to Sydney. In October 1976, "Melbourne" participated in Exercise Kangaroo II, before sailing to her namesake city for the carrier's 21st birthday celebrations, then returning to Sydney on 5 November.
The 1989 iteration of Exercise Kangaroo was the largest military exercise to have been undertaken in Australia during peacetime up to that time. It involved 28,000 Australian and American military personnel. The exercise next took place in 1992, with over 12,000 Australian and American personnel taking part.
When Lieutenant General John Sanderson became Commander Joint Forces Australia (CJFA) in the early 1990s, his main task was to plan the Kangaroo series of exercises. Sanderson said that when the Vice Chief of Defence Force acted as CJFA in Ex Kangaroo 1989 he could not exercise command properly because he did not have a suitable command support system. Exercises Kangaroo 89 and '92 showed the need for the co-location of the joint headquarters. At one stage of Kangaroo '92 in the space of 30 minutes, two ships, one with a battalion of infantry embarked, were 'sunk' for lack of air cover.

Belegost

Belegost is a 1989 Czech text adventure for the ZX spectrum, and Atari ST.
It is considered part of the textovka genre – the Czechoslovak text adventure industry.
Development.
The game was developed by Golden Triangle, a development trio made up of Frantisek Fuka (Fuxoft), Miroslav Fídler (Cybexlab) and Tomáš Rylek (TRC), who would later go on to make "Jet-Story" and "Tetris 2". The music was composed by František Fuka.
The three met at Prague's Arabská Gymnázium, and before they had access to computers they programmed on squared paper and learned the basics on a scientific calculator; their first computers were ZX Spectrums, which is what essentially all of their games were made for. When they did begin to create games they started on their own, but they eventually started assisting with each other's creations. When Rylek finished the last levels in Fuk's Tetris 2, according to Fuka "That's when we all put the 'Golden Triangle' logo in all our games (no matter who made us the game), with the name of the product always above the top corner of the triangle". All three members of the Golden Triangle participated in this title, although the main driving force behind Belegost was Miroslav Fídler.
In order to make the game more user-friendly than older titles such as Vampire or Exoter, Fidler designed an icon command menu, a context-sensitive help text, and a listing of on-screen motion options. The script and program were written by Marek Fídler, while the music was composed by František Fuka. The player was able to turn the music on and off again during the game. The help clues could be accessed via the menu, and contained simple nursery rhymes in a fantasy theme. To orient the players in the game map environment, the game include contextual directions such as 'to the mountain' or 'along the stream', rather than using the cardinal directions. Unusual for text adventures at the time, the game has a sense of delayed action for certain game events, for instance when the player burns moss, the game indicates that the moss is burning and regardless of if the player completes an action, will later note than the moss flame has extinguished - if the player was not ready to complete their required action they would be unable to successfully complete the game.
Belegost is one of the many text adventures of the time inspired by the works of Tolkien, including the 1979 Norwegian adventure Ringen, a series that began with "The Hobbit", and parodies such as "The Boggit" and "Bored of the Rings". Specifically, the game draws inspiration from Tolkien's book The Silmarillion which was not yet available in Cheaslovakia at the time of the game's release. "Historie a kontext produkce počítačových her žánru adventure v České republice" notes that Tolkien's works were a popular subject for video games in the 1980s, and that Belegost fits into that trend alongside Melbourne House's "The Hobbit" (1982), and Addison Wesley Publishing Company's trio of games "" (1986), "The Shadows of Mordor" (1987), and "The Crack Of Doom" (1989).
The game experienced success on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum and compatible computers, which led to conversions to other platforms including Atari ST, MS-DOS, Psion pocket computers, NeXTStep and Mac OS X. It was later ported to the Apple iPhone, both in the original Czech language as well as in English translation.
English versions were later made for the NeXTSTEP and Psion, while in 2010 a remixed version was created by Lacrima for iOS devices in both Czech and English, featuring the original music. The game is in the public domain.
The game has been added to the SNDH archive.
Plot.
The game is a manifestation of the motifs of JRR Tolkien's novels; the title comes from one of the underground dwarf towns in Lord of the Rings, which is also where the game is set. Within the narrative, the town has been plundered by the Orcs, while the Alqualamir stone remained in the city. The task of the player is to find the stone and escape the city.
Reception.
Freegames.cz commented that the "hilarous" Czech game had a simple yet visually pleasing atmosphere. In 2002, FreeHry.cz said that while the game was over a decade old it was still quite good-quality. "Historie a kontext produkce počítačových her žánru adventure v České republice" praised the title's original features, and its "well-elaborated story". The paper Indiana Jones Fights the Communist Police notes that Belegost was an example of the Czechoslovak text adventure industry drawing inspiration from fantasy. Database-her.cz noted that by filtering out the Czech games in their database and sorting them by year of release, the oldest Czech game is Belegost, though added that this is only true of DOS games. Root.cz notes that Belegost is one Czech game along with "Indiana Jones 2" that didn't "blindly" copy the control system for Colossal Cave Adventure, in that the two titles, both the brainchilds of Fuka, use icons and drop-down menus. Its reputation led to it being the " one of the first games we reviewed within the Free Games server". Gaming the Iron Curtain argued that the title's icon based interface led to it being essentially a point n click adventure without graphics. CZpug deemed the game "the best Czech game on Spectrum", and "a masterpiece of the Golden Triangle".

Defending champion Xiao Ruoteng of China lost the title on a tiebreaker to Russia's Artur Dalaloyan. The tie-breaking procedure in this situation is dropping of the lowest-scoring apparatus from the combined score, and whoever's total score on the remaining five apparatuses is higher after that will rank ahead (74.198 versus 73.465). Dalaloyan became the first Russian man to win the all-around title since Nikolai Kryukov in 1999; they were at that time the only two Russian men to have won the title in the post-Soviet era. Last year's silver medalist, China's Lin Chaopan, failed to reach the final after finishing behind teammates Xiao and Sun Wei in qualifying. Reigning bronze medalist Kenzō Shirai of Japan finished in seventh place after some weaker and lower-scoring apparatuses, namely pommel horse. 
Canada's René Cournoyer withdrew prior to the competition and was replaced by first reserve Artur Davtyan of Armenia.

The same situation with the score (14.333) happened for Kazuma Kaya of Japan, Sam Mikulak of the USA and James Hall of Britain, when Kaya and Mikulak took the final's last two spots after their tied 8th place because they posted identical D- and E-scores while Hall ended up placing 10th, and just missed qualifying for the finals, even though he posted the same combined score.

The Woman who Sings

The Woman who Sings () is a 1978 Soviet film by Aleksandr Orlov. It is a musical melodrama and fictionalized biography of Alla Pugacheva, where the heroine is represented by Anna Streltsova.
The All-Union premiere of the film took place on March 2, 1979. According to the results of the Soviet film distribution in 1979, the film won first place, having collected 55 million spectators, and the performer of the leading role Alla Pugacheva according to the poll of the magazine Soviet Screen was named "The Best Actress of the Year".&lt;ref name="http://akter.kulichki.com/se/10_1983"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the film itself took only 53 place in the vote for the best film of the year. "The Woman who Sings" occupies the 27th place in attendance in the history of Soviet box-office.
Plot.
The film is about pop singer Anna Streltsova, who is deliberating whether or not to give up her stage career, since she still does not have that song which would help her achieve her full potential.
At the same time, the heroine's personal life is developing unsuccessfully. Conflicts with her husband and the eventual divorce unsettle the woman. But even in a stressful condition, she does not want to give up her favorite work, continuing to sing and make her way to fame.
When Anna reads a poem titled "The Woman I Love", she feels that it would make a good song. Later she meets the poem's author, Andrei, who advises her to change the lyrics to "The Woman who Sings". Even before this Anna's career begins establishing and she starts to sing in many performances. Her songs have already been accomplishments, but still nothing like "The Woman who Sings" which she performs at the end of the film. Anna finally achieves incredible popularity and is now the No. 1 star of the Soviet stage. She tours in major cities, performs in large halls and has great success with the audience.
Music.
Soundtrack.
Originally Aleksandr Zatsepin was to score the soundtrack. However, during the filming there was a conflict between Zatsepin and Pugacheva due to the fact that she, without warning him in advance, inserted her songs (under the pseudonym Boris Gorbonos) without his knowledge. Because of this, Zatsepin refused to be the composer, but agreed to leave his songs in the film. As a result, all background music was written by Alla Pugacheva.
Background music in the picture consists of two compositions, which later became songs in Pugacheva's repertoire. The episode with the child, as well as the conversation with Andrei and a rehearsal before the contest, is accompanied by a melody that later became the song "I Will Not Give You to Anyone" (Alla Pugacheva's music, Larisa Kulikova's lyrics, appeared in the repertoire of the singer in 1987). In the scene of the last conversation, Streltsova and her husband behind the scenes sounded vocalizing this melody.
At the last minute of the film the montage of Streltsova walking on the observation deck on the Lenin Hills, along the Victory Park in Tolyatti, a concert at the Volgar Sports Palace in Tolyatti is accompanied by a melody that later became the song "Applying all Force" (Alla Pugacheva's music, the words of Yevgeny Yevtushenko, appeared in the repertoire of the singer in 1978).
Also in the film was to sound the song "In the Grove of the Guelder-rose" to the music of Alla Pugacheva and verses of Yunna Morits, however the poet forbade the song to be used for her poems in the film. Subsequently, Pugacheva put other lyrics — a poem by Oleg Milyavsky, on original music of this song and so in Pugachev's repertoire appeared the song "Dad Bought a Car". Additionally, in the episode of the concert at the Railwaymen's Club, before the song "Come" sounded the first few measures of the song "What was Once", which was recorded by Pugacheva for the movie "31 June" but did not make it into the film.
The text of the song "The Woman Who Sings" was originally written by the poet Qaysin Quli in Karachay-Balkar language, translated into Russian by Naum Grebnev and was called "The Woman I Love". Pugacheva removed two verses, changed the viewpoint from the third to the first person and amended the last line in the verses.
The song "If Long Suffering" was recorded for the movie "The Cook and the Singer" (1978) and sounded there in full. According to the original idea, this song should not have been in the "Woman Who Sings".
Reception.
During the time of its release, the film had a mixed critical reception.

Dagmar Margrethe Kristine Starcke née Kaae (1899–1975) was a Danish painter and textile artist who is remembered for her pictorial collages and woven textile works. Several of her creations are in the permanent collection at the Worker's Museum in Copenhagen. Starcke was one of the artists who contributed to the sewing and embroidery organization Haandarbejdets Fremme.
Biography.
Born on 13 December 1899 in the Frederiksberg district of Copenhagen, Dagmar Margrethe Kristine Kaae was the daughter of Frederik Christian Larsen Kaae and Hansine Klinge. After matriculating from high school, she attended the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskole for Kvinder (Drawing and Handicrafts School for Women) before studying at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Sigurd Wandel (1921–24). In 1925 in Paris, she married the sculptor Henrik Starcke (1899–1973).
Although she graduated from the Danish Academy as a painter, Starcke was above all proficient as a textile artist, creating pictorial collages and woven pieces, both large and small. She used fabrics or "rags" of various kinds to provide shape and colour to her work, creating simple but refined artistic compositions. Her subjects were frequently inspired by the tales of Hans Christian Andersen or by stories from the Bible. Many of her works were used to decorate public institutions or social housing. Starcke also worked with other materials and techniques, for example by creating mosaics of sintered brick.
Dagmar Starcke died in Farum around 27 July 1975.
Awards.
Starcke received several grants and awards including the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (1943) and the Niels Larsen Stevns prize (1973).

Flexible metal-organic framework

Some metal-organic frameworks (MOF) display large structural changes as a response to external stimuli, and such modifications of their structure can, in turn, lead to drastic changes in their physical and chemical properties. Such stimuli-responsive MOFs are generally referred to as a flexible metal-organic frameworks. They can also be called dynamic metal-organic framework, stimuli-responsive MOFs, multi-functional MOFs, or soft porous crystals. Formally, a metal-organic framework is a coordination network with organic ligands containing potential voids. A coordination network is a coordination compound extending, through repeating coordination entities, in one dimension, but with cross-links between two or more individual chains, loops, or spiro-links, or a coordination compound extending through repeating coordination entities in two or three dimensions. A coordination polymer is a coordination compound with repeating coordination entities extending in one, two, or three dimensions.
Generally, this kind of material has a well-defined structure, but sometimes some external stimuli can affect its structure, resulting in a different structure without breaking the overall network. A variety of external stimuli like heat, light, solvent, an electric field, magnetic field, etc. can act upon a metal-organic framework, can act to change its internal structure, and can facilitate the transformation process. This structural transformation generally occurs by bond breaking/making, change of coordination number of the metal ion, change of coordination mode of ligand, ligand length squeezing, solvent exchange, solvent removal, etc.
One often discussed example of flexible metal-organic framework is the family of MIL-53 materials, featuring one-dimensional diamond-shaped pores that can expand or contract upon stimulation, such as adsorption of guest molecules (solvent, water, gases, etc.), changes in temperature, and mechanical pressure.

Gazi Mahallesi railway station () is a railway station in Ankara, Turkey, currently being rebuilt. The station was a stop on the Ankara suburban from 1972 to 2016 when it was closed and demolished shortly after, in order to rebuild and expand the railway. Construction of the new station began in 2017 and is expected to open on 12 April 2018.
The station is located within the neighborhood () of Gazi in Yenimahalle. 
Gazi Mahallesi was originally built in 1970 by the Turkish State Railways, when the railway from Ankara to Sincan was double-tracked. It entered service in 1972. In 1984, a second platform was added when the railway was expanded to four tracks. This platform was disused in the late 1990s but remained until early 2012 when it was demolished.

Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets

Contribution to ARIEL Spectroscopy of Exoplanets (CASE) is a detector subsystem contribution to an infrared spectrometer instrument for the planned European ARIEL space telescope. It is being developed by NASA as a contribution to the European Space Agency (ESA) project to add scientific capabilities to the space telescope to observe the chemical composition of the atmospheres of exoplanets, as well exoplanetary metallicities. The ARIEL spacecraft with CASE on board is planned to launch in 2029.
Overview.
ARIEL will be able to study the chemical "fingerprints", or spectra of an exoplanet's atmosphere as the light of its host star passes through the exoplanetplanet's atmosphere. The addition of CASE will enable ARIEL to observe clouds and hazes, which help establish planetary climate, and provide a more comprehensive picture of the exoplanet atmospheres ARIEL observes.
The CASE instrument consists of two detectors and associated electronics that are sensitive to light at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths as well as visible light. The detectors and its associated electronics are the same that NASA is contributing to ESA's Euclid mission, being a mosaic of 4×4 Teledyne H2RG detectors sensitive to near-infrared light radiation (1.0-2.0 μm) with 65 million pixels. CASE will be a subsystem of ARIEL's FGS instrument, which is an infrared spectrometer that operates in two channels (0.50-1.2 μm photometry; 1.25-1.95 μm spectroscopy).
CASE is an astrophysics Mission of Opportunity by the Explorers Program. The Principal Investigator of CASE is Mark Swain, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The ARIEL spacecraft with CASE on board is planned to launch in 2029.

Isethionates

Isethionates are esters of long-chain aliphatic carboxylic acids (C8 – C18) with isethionic acid (2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid) or salts thereof, such as ammonium isethionate or sodium isethionate. They are also referred to as acyl isethionates or acyloxyethanesulfonates.
Like the taurides, isethionates are a class of particularly mild anionic surfactants which, unlike ordinary soaps, retain their washing-active properties even in hard water. Isethionates are obtained on an industrial scale reacting mixtures of carboxylic acids with salts of isethionic acid under acidic catalysis e. g. with methanesulfonic acid. The mixtures of carboxylic acids are obtained from the hydrolysis of animal fats (tallow) or vegetable oils, preferably coconut oil, but also palm oil, soybean oil or castor oil.
Isethionates are solids which are often mixed with fatty acids (up to 30% by weight) to lower their freezing point. Despite its low water solubility (100ppm at 25 °C), the lower-priced sodium cocoylisethionate has found more widespread use than its well water-soluble ammonium salt (&gt; 25 wt.% at 25 °C). To solubilize the sparsely soluble isethionates and taurides, the formation of mixtures with amphoteric surfactants (such as cocamidopropyl betaine) are proposed. From such mixtures, it is possible to prepare liquid, clear and transparent aqueous concentrates which are liquid at room temperature.
Isethionates are characterized by excellent skin compatibility, excellent foaming (even in hard water), good cleansing properties and a pleasant skin feel. They are non-toxic and readily biodegradable. However, in contrast to the taurides, they are not long-term stable outside a pH range of 5 to 8. Isethionates are used in solid soaps (so-called syndet bars) and in other personal care products such as lotions, washing and shower gels, shampoos, liquid soaps, shaving creams, and other cosmetic and dermatological preparations.

267th Field Artillery Battalion

 
The 267th Field Artillery Battalion (267th FAB) was a Field Artillery battalion of the United States Army during World War II. During the Cold War, it was briefly reactivated as the 267th Armored Field Artillery Battalion (267th AFAB).
World War II.
Formation and training.
On 25 January 1943, the 267th Field Artillery Battalion was constituted in the Army of the United States; it was activated on 1 March at Camp Shelby. The 267th FAB, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Walter Hinsch, was a truck drawn 105 mm howitzer, nondivisional unit assigned to the Third Army. Attached to the 403rd Field Artillery Group of XIX Corps, it was officered by reservists and recent graduates of the Field Artillery Officer Candidate School at Fort Sill, and manned by Georgia National Guardsmen transferred from the 179th Field Artillery Group and Selective Service draftees from the Field Artillery Replacement Training Centers at Fort Bragg and Fort Sill. The battalion spent the most of the year training at Camp Shelby.
On 26 December it was transferred to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and assigned to the 402nd Field Artillery Group of XII Corps, part of the Second Army. At Fort Bragg, the 267th converted to the 240 mm howitzer M1, the largest field artillery piece excluding railway guns fielded by the United States Army during the war. It was one of fifteen 240mm howitzer battalions fielded by the United States during the war. Between 23 April and 5 May 1944, the 267th FAB staged for deployment at Fort Slocum, Fort Dix, and Camp Kilmer. At Fort Dix the 267th resumed intensive training, then awaited transportation at Camp Kilmer until 22 July.
Overseas service and demobilization.
The battalion crossed the Atlantic aboard the RMS "Queen Mary", arriving in England on 28 July. While awaiting movement to France, the 267th stayed in temporary quarters at Bude. The battalion crossed the English Channel from Weymouth aboard LSTs and LCTs on 1 September and had landed at Utah Beach in its entirety by 4 September, with the elements aboard the LCTs having been delayed by a storm. Between 5 September and 17 December, the battalion provided artillery support for the Third Army during its advance to the Rhine across Northern France. From 17 December to the end of the war, it was relieved from XII Corps and placed on special duty with the Third Army Provost Marshal, guarding bridges and handling prisoners of war in the army area.
On 19 May the 267th moved forward to Auerbach, where it guarded a prisoner of war camp for captured German troops. The battalion was ordered transferred to the South West Pacific to participated in the invasion of Japan by an order of 1 August, but the order was cancelled due to the surrender of Japan. The 267th returned to the United States on 11 February 1946 and was inactivated the following day at Camp Kilmer.
For its service in Europe, the battalion was authorized four campaign streamers including: Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe. In the European Theater of Operation the Battalion had two men wounded and none killed. Three officers received the Air Medal. Four officers and 48 enlisted men received Bronze Star Medals, and two enlisted men received Purple Heart Medals.
Cold War.
On 31 January 1949, the 267th was redesignated as the 971st Field Artillery Battalion and allotted to the Organized Reserve Corps. It was activated at Newark, New Jersey on 7 March 1949, inactivating there on 12 July 1950. The battalion was again redesignated as the 267th FAB on 14 March 1952. On 14 January 1955, it was redesignated as the 267th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and transferred to the Regular Army.
On 7 March 1955, the 267th AFAB was reactivated at Fort Sill, equipped with M114 155 mm howitzer. It deployed to Babenhausen Germany on 1 April 1956, replacing the 597th Armored Field Artillery Battalion and was inactivated on 1 December 1957 in Germany.
It departed Fort Sill on 3/27/1956 to replaced the at Hanau Germany on 4/1/1956 after sailing from NY City to Bremehaven Germany. This was part of Operation Gyroscope. It was stationed in Babenhausen and attached to the 36th Field Artillery Group. The Battalion was inactivated in Germany on 12/1/1957 when it was replaced by the 288th Armored Field Artillery Battalion.

Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi

The Nimatnama-i-Nasiruddin-Shahi (نعمت‌نامه نصیرالدین‌شاهی lit. "Book of Delicacies of Nasir-ud-Din Shah") (c. 1500) is a medieval Indian cookbook, written in Persian language using Naskh script, of delicacies and recipes, and some accompanying paintings illustrating the preparation of the recipes. It was started for Ghiyath Shah (r. 1469-1500), the ruler of the Malwa Sultanate in central India. After he was forced to abdicate, it was completed for his son 'Abd al-Muzaffar Nasir Shah. (r. 1500-10).
Some of the illustrations have women painted wearing men's various types of Persian and Indian garments and turbans, including a specific style of turban which is also featured in Turkman style paintings of 1470s. The style of the surrounding landscape are influenced by the Turkmen style of the last third of the 15th century.
The Manuscript is in the British Library, London. It was first written about by Robert Skelton in 1959.
At least two artists collaborated in illustrating the Ni'mat nāmā. These artists emphasized different features of Turkmen style of Shirazi painting that was contemporary at that time. The illustrations also introduced representations of indigenous costumes of Malwa and Indian facial types. Such stylistic innovations are also seen in paintings from the Cāurāpāncāsika (Chaurapanchasika) series. This suggests that reciprocal influences were at work between centers of painting of Muslim and Hindu patronage.

T-1123

T-1123 is a carbamate-based acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. It was investigated as a chemical warfare agent starting in 1940. It does not go through the blood-brain barrier due to the charge on quaternary nitrogen. The antidote is atropine. T-1123 is a quaternary ammonium ion. A phenyl carbamate ester is bonded in the meta position to the nitrogen on a diethylmethyl amine. The chloride and methylsulfate salt of T-1123 is TL-1299 and TL-1317, respectively.
Synthesis.
T-1123 can be produced from m-diethylaminophenol, methyl isocyanate and methyl iodide. First, m-diethylaminophenol is reacted with methyl isocyanate to produce a methylcarbamate. The resulting methylcarbamate is then reacted with methyl iodide to produce T-1123.

Michaelina Bellamy

Michaelina Raquel Bellamy (June 13, 1952 – April 7, 2012) was an American singer, dancer, actress and U.S. Air Force Veteran.
Early life.
Michaelina Raquel Bellamy was born to James and Olga Bellamy in 1952, in Los Angeles, California. She was the third oldest out of six children, and the oldest daughter. Her older brother Tony Bellamy, was the lead guitarist for the Native American Rock Band, RedBone. Her other siblings include the Latin Percussionist, Renaldo "Reno" Bellamy. She was raised in Orange County, California, where she studied opera singing and Flamenco dancing with her siblings. She graduated from Tustin High School in 1970. She was of Swedish, Spanish and Mexican descent, and spoke English, Spanish, and Portuguese, fluently.
Career.
After a USO tour with Bob Hope in 1971, Bellamy entered the Air Force, and sang with the Airmen of Note, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant. Having competed her military service, she moved to Nevada, and worked in various lounges and showrooms, until becoming the Lead Singer and Dancer in The Folies Bergere, at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino from 1978 to 1984. Between The Folies Bergere and a European and American tour as a backup singer for Engelbert Humperdinck in the late 80s, Bellamy performed across the country, from Las Vegas to Atlantic City in various shows, including the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1984. Bellamy briefly returned to the Folies in 1987, before leaving in 1990 to tour again with Humperdinck. In 1994, Bellamy recorded a live concert with Humperdinck, performing the song "When I Fall In Love", as a duet; as well as a solo performance of an updated version of "Malaguena." In the early 2000s, she was a single-billed performer at the top of the Stratosphere, in Las Vegas, Nevada.
Controversy.
In January 2007, Michaelina Bellamy was assaulted by a priest, who she claimed had become obsessed with her. She was working as an Events Coordinator for Our Lady of Las Vegas Catholic Church, in Las Vegas, NV, and worked under Rev. George Chaanine. On January 26, 2007, around 5pm, George Chaanine crept up behind Bellamy, and smashed her in the head with a large wine bottle. When she was not subdued, he struggled and beat her, breaking her hand, and choking her until "she felt she was dying." She told police that she was losing consciousness and started to pray. Bellamy testified in court that the priest assaulted her sexually, but later agreed to drop those charges in order to avoid a lengthy trial. Chaanine ran from the scene and fled to California and Arizona, while a nationwide manhunt was conducted for 5 days. The case appeared on America's Most Wanted, and Chaanine was apprehended 30 miles outside of Phoenix, in Apache Junction, AZ on January 31, 2007. Chaanine was held on a $1 Million bond, pending arraignment in March 2007. Bellamy was treated at University Medical Center in Las Vegas for a large head gash, that reportedly needed 20 staples along her skull. She suffered a broken left hand and multiple bruises and contusions. Both Bellamy and her youngest daughter testified that Chaanine was obsessed with Bellamy, stating, "..the more I stayed away, the more he pushed..." Chaanine took a plea deal to agree to plead guilty to Felony Battery with a Deadly Weapon, which carried a maximum number of 15 years in prison. Chaanine went to prison from 2007 until 2013, after being released on parole.
Personal life.
Michaelina Bellamy married jazz conductor Johnny Veith in the mid-70s, and they had three daughters. When not on tour with larger acts, they played together in smaller lounges and supper clubs across the country, and along the California coastline. They divorced in 1997.
Death.
Michaelina Bellamy died two months and six days from her 60th birthday on April 7, 2012, after battling acute myeloid leukemia for a year. She was interred at the Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery in Boulder City, Nevada. She is survived by her three daughters and eight grandchildren.

Swigridova kletba

Swigridova kletba is a 1996 Czech adventure game developed by Agawa and published by JRC Interactive for DOS.
Production.
Agawa released two games: "Mise Quadam" in 1995 and "Swigridova kletba" in 1996. The developers were displeased with the graphic processing of their previous title "Mise Quadam", so they hired the professional artist Zden Jasanovska for this game.
The game was sold at a price of 500.176 Crowns. The game was one of the first successful Czech adventure games; its design is similar to "The Legend of Kyrandia". It is also among the shortest commercially released Czech adventure games.
Plot and gameplay.
The game is a fairy-tale adventure similar to "The Legend of Kyrandia". The player controls a simple shepherd named Robinto, who is tasked with defeating the evil Swigrid and returning the magic horn of Kerke to his home in Manahon county. The game is divided into three parts; in order to progress to the next part the player has to complete a goal such as getting money for a ferry.
"Swigridova kletba" is a classic point-and-click adventure based on collecting objects, using them and combining them together. The game is entirely controlled via the mouse. Players explore the environment, talk to characters and solve puzzles. Items can be collected and stored in the inventory at the bottom of the screen. Graphically, the game is similar to "Dračí Historie". 
Critical reception.
Tomáš Landa from Score magazine appreciated the change in graphic design from "Mise Quadam". Level magazine felt the game was amateur, especially when compared to "Dračí historií", and criticized the narrative for being short, simple and straightforward.
Gamesite.sk felt the game elevated the Czech-Slovakian video gaming industry a little higher, and added that while it was a short adventure, it had its roots in Czech culture and contained Czech dubbing, which was rare at the time. Old-games.ru felt the game was not interesting, yet valuable from a video game history perspective.

Hans Keirstead

Hans Keirstead is a medical scientist and entrepreneur specializing in stem cell research.
Early life and education.
Keirstead received his Ph.D. from the University of British Columbia, winning the Cameron Award for the best Ph.D. thesis in the country, with his thesis constituting the first demonstration of functional regeneration of the injured adult spinal cord. He went on to complete four years of post-doctoral studies at the University of Cambridge, where he was the youngest person elected to two senior academic posts, Fellow of the Governing Body of Downing College and Senate Member of the University of Cambridge.
Career.
In 2000, Keirstead left his position at the University of British Columbia, where his spinal cord research had been funded by Rick Hansen's charitable foundation. He joined the Reeve-Irvine Research Center at the University of California, Irvine.
Keirstead has advised U.S. Senators and members of Congress on health care and biotechnology. He testified on the state's biotech industry to the California State Senate in 2002 amidst a national debate about stem cell laws and policy in the United States.
In 2004, Keirstead publicly supported California Proposition 71, which aimed to authorize three billion dollars for stem cell research for a newly created California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. During the debate he released a video of how he could restore mobility to paralyzed rats using his stem cell research. Keirstead was criticized at the time, because the procedure had yet to be published in a peer reviewed journal, but it subsequently published the following year in the Journal of Neuroscience. The procedure was reproduced by three other labs by 2006, confirming that cells engineered to make myelin can help restore damaged areas of the spinal cord.
Keirstead was Professor of Anatomy and Neurobiology and Professor of Neurological Surgery at the School of Medicine of the University of California at Irvine for fifteen years, where he was awarded over $16 million in grants and founded the Sue and Bill Gross Stem Cell Research Center. In his academic career, he mentored more than 100 students and published more than 100 manuscripts.
He launched medical research startup companies in Orange County and is currently CEO at AIVITA Biomedical. Other corporate affiliations include Neuron Therapeutics, Inc., Caladrius Biosciences, Inc., Lifeline Cell Technology, LLC, International Stem Cell Corporation, NeoStem Oncology, LLC, Ekso Bionics Holdings, Inc., and ALPHAEON Corporation.
He has developed new treatments for cancer and for neurological injuries, and has been granted over 20 patents.
In 2010, Geron Corporation began the world's first clinical trial of human embryonic stem cell treatment for spinal cord injuries, based on the research of Keirstead's team at UC Irvine. However, the trials ended after a year due to lack of funds.
In 2013, Keirstead took a leave of absence from UC Irvine to conduct tests in the private sector. He joined California Stem Cell, Inc., also based in Irvine, as its president and CEO. His first focus after the leave of absence was trials for targeting skin cancer cells using stem cells from the cancer itself to train the immune system.
In 2014, he sold a stem-cell company in a deal worth $124 million.
In 2016, Keirstead founded AIVITA Biomedical, a private biotechnology company focused on cancer and developing a treatment that is proving to be the most effective to ever reach the final phase of clinical trials. Since its inception, the company began four clinical trials in multiple countries to test its cancer vaccine technology in glioblastoma, ovarian cancer and melanoma. Additionally, AIVITA is beginning trials of its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, AV-COVID-19.
Using the same stem cell technology, Keirstead became the first person to transform stem cells into a product that improves the appearance of facial skin. After discovering this new application, Keirstead helped AIVITA launch a skin care line called ROOT OF SKIN, which became available in Japan in 2019 after successful clinical trials. The proceeds from all ROOT OF SKIN sales are directed towards AIVITA’s cancer research programs.
Keirstead announced in June 2017 that he would run for Congress as a Democrat, challenging a seat held by Dana Rohrabacher in California's 48th Congressional District. In a 2018 interview with ABILITY Magazine, Keirstead said "We don’t have anyone [in Washington] with a broad, deep understanding of the healthcare system, for example, not a one. 435 members, and there’s no one there with a broad, deep understanding of what is 20 percent of our economy. We need that." He conceded the Democratic Party primary to Harley Rouda on Sunday, June 24, 2018 after a very close race. His campaign appears to have been targeted by a cyberattack.
Personal life.
His wife, Niki, is a neuroscientist specializing in Alzheimer's disease. They have one son.
Keirstead has a third-degree black belt in Taekwondo. He owns and flies his own helicopter.

Chapman Lake (Gouin Reservoir)

The Chapman Lake is a vast expanse of freshwater in the central part of the Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in Haute-Mauricie, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This bay extends into the cantons of Chapman (northern part), Huguenin (southern part) and Nevers (eastern part). Following
the completion of the Gouin Dam in 1948, the current form of Chapman Lake was shaped by the raising of the Gouin Reservoir. The water level varies significantly, being dependent on the Gouin Dam.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
A road branch connecting to the South at route 400 serves the southern portion of Chapman Lake and the southwestern portion of "Lac des Cinq Milles". The route 400 connects the Gouin Dam to the village of
Parent, Quebec, also serves the river valleys Jean-Pierre and Leblanc; this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of Chapman Lake is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, but safe ice circulation is generally from early December to the end of March.
Toponymy.
The term "Chapman" is a family name of English origin.
The toponym "lac Chapman" was formalized on December 18, 1986, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Crankworx

"Crankworx" is a four-stop tour of slopestyle mountain biking events, the premier event of which is held each summer at Whistler-Blackcomb in Whistler, British Columbia at Whistler Mountain Bike Park.
The event focuses specifically on high-injury-risk downhill mountain biking, Freeride, stunt jumps, and other extreme variants thereof. It is important to note that these are markedly different from cross-country touring-style cycling.
A reasonable indication of the risk of serious injury inherent to downhill-type and stunt-jump-based mountain biking can be gleaned from the Athlete Waiver form for the event.
Since its inception in 2004, Crankworx has become one of Whistler's largest annual promotionals. The event has recently spawned sister events in France and New Zealand. It has been called the Super Bowl of the sport, and is the biggest annual gathering of the mountain biking community.
Festival.
A central aspect of Crankworx is a series of village-wide promotional displays and activities pertaining to extreme-style mountain biking. Many events happen throughout the week including demonstrations of bicycle tricks, music, and other entertainment. There is also a collection of manufacturers' booths, and the festival serves as a cycling industry gathering. Prominent display-type advertising, for a very wide variety of products, is present throughout all events. The festival has attracted sponsors including Bud Light, CLIF Bar, Monster Energy, Volkswagen, Dose.ca, SRAM Corporation, Norco, Giant Bicycles, Redbull, the Kona Bicycle Company, and various other corporate entities.
Competitions.
The events held in 2009 were: Dual slalom, Monster Energy Garbonzo Downhill, Quon Memorial X/C Race, Womenzworx, Air Downhill, VW Trick Showdown, Giant Slalom, Kidsworx, Canadian Open Enduro, Trailsworx, Canadian Cheese Rolling Championships, Monster Energy Slopestyle, and the Canadian Open Downhill presented by Kona.

Cathinka Buchwieser

Katharina Buchwieser (24 May 1789 – 9 July 1828) was a German operatic soprano and actress. She was known as Cathinka, and her married surname was Lacsny von Folkusfálva. She appeared at theatres of Vienna, the Theater an der Wien and the Theater am Kärntnertor, then the court theatre. Franz Schubert dedicated compositions to her.
Career.
Born in Koblenz, the daughter of the composer and Kapellmeister Balthasar Buchwieser, she made her debut in 1802 at the Frankfurt Opera as Myrrha in Peter von Winter's "Das unterbrochene Opferfest". She certainly sang there in the 1803/04 season. In 1806, she moved to Vienna, where her father became Kapellmeister at the Theater an der Wien. She first appeared at the theatre on 6 December that year as Sesto in Mozart's "La clemenza di Tito".
She performed regularly at the Kärntnertortheater from 1809. She appeared as the Princess of Navarra in "Jean de Paris" by François-Adrien Boieldieu in 1813 at the Theater an der Wien. In 1814, she appeared as Irene in Giacomo Meyerbeer's early opera "Die beiden Kalifen". She performed as an actress, as it was customary in Vienna.
Her operatic roles included Mozart's Donna Elvira in "Don Giovanni", the title roles of Ferdinando Paer's "Achille", "Camilla" and "Leonora", and the title role in Henri-Montan Berton's "Aline, reine de Golconde". She retired from the stage in 1815, but still performed in concerts.
Hochwieser married Karl Joseph Graf von Hrzan in 1808. The marriage was annulled by the emperor in 1820 after Hrzan was accused of criminal actions. In 1821, she married Miklós Lacsny, an administrator of the estates of Count Ferdinánd Pálffy.
Franz Schubert probably knew her in connection to her former colleague Johann Michael Vogl, and met Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Ferdinand Hiller at soirées in her home, among others. He dedicated compositions to her, his "Lieder" after poems by Johann Mayrhofer, Op. 36, which is the second version of two songs, "Der zürnenden Diana" (To Diana in her wrath), D. 707, and "Nachtstück", D. 672, and his "Divertissement à l'hongroise" in G minor for piano duet, D. 818 (Op. 54).
Buchwieser died in Vienna.

Babaocai () is a typical Chinese dish that is made by frying various vegetables and seafood in oil.
Babaocai is a combination of eight ingredients called babao (八寶) and cai (菜), which means "vegetables, dishes, side dishes". Babaocai contains seafood such as sea cucumbers, shrimp, squid, and vegetables such as bamboo shoots. Sprinkle chili oil on a large, hollow plate and roast the seafood and ingredients.
The dish is known as Palbochae () in Korean and as Happosai in Japanese.
History.
There are various theories about the origin of Babaocai. In the end of the Qing Dynasty of China, the mokjung Emperor's birth mother was a renowned gourmet known to order 120 kinds of side dishes. Her chefs would prepare the sides dishes, taste the remaining ingredients, and then taste the food. Another theory is that in the 11th century, farmers in Liaoning province began to eat various foods they once ate with tea while chatting during work breaks.

Mystic Bank

The Mystic Bank is a historic commercial building at 39 Main Street in the Old Mystic village of Stonington, Connecticut. Built in 1856 for a bank founded in 1833, it was used by the town as a meeting hall after the bank closed in 1884, and now houses offices. It is a good example of a small 19th-century Greek Revival brick bank building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.
Description and history.
The former Mystic Bank building is located in the center of Old Mystic Village, on the west side of Main Street south of its junction with Old Mystic Center Road. It is a modest single-story brick building, with a gabled roof and granite foundation. The main facade is three bays wide, topped by a pedimented gable. Each bay is set in a round-arch recess, with rectangular sash windows in the outer bays and the main entrance in the center bay. Each are topped by stone lintels, with brickwork filling the rounded arch above. The interior retains virtually all of its original finishes, including woodwork, plaster, and flooring; the original bank vault is also still present.
The Mystic Bank was founded in 1833 by a consortium of local businessmen as a service to the local shipbuilding community and the surrounding rural areas. The bank flourished, and was able to build this building in 1856 to accommodate its expanded business. Mystic's economic center, however, had begun to shift south to the Mystic Bridge area (now Mystic), and the bank closed in 1887. The town of Stonington acquired the building soon afterward, and used it as a district meeting hall and polling place. These uses ended about 1960. The building was again repurposed, this time to house the Indian and Colonial Research Center, a museum displaying a collection of native and colonial-era artifacts.

He was elected in 1868 and represented Hancock County, Georgia in the 80th Georgia General Assembly. He was appointed to the Committee on Manufactures. He only served one term. 
He asked for military units to protect a black school in 1869. As a result, he received threats and intimidation from members of the Ku Klux Klan. 
Barnes was one of those who testified to a select committee of congress about widespread intimidation and horrific attacks in African Americans in the Southern States. He told the congressional investigating committee, "It has got to be quite a common thing. . . to hear a man say, 'They rode around my house last night, and they played the mischief there; my wife was molested, my daughter badly treated, and they played the wild generally with my family.'"

SB Xylonite

Xylonite is one of seven Thames barges built between 1925 and 1930 for F W Horlock, Mistley. She was sold by the Horlocks in 1958 and cut down to a motor barge in 1958. "Xylonite" was re-rigged in the 1970s by Tim Eliff and replated on the 1980s. She has been used for sail training since 1983.
Description.
"Xylonite" is long, with a beam of and a draught of . She is assessed at . She is built of steel, and while lacking the romance of a wooden ship, she has a greater cargo carrying capacity, and is lighter and cheaper to operate.
The name Xylonite derives from the original 1869 name for celluloid.
History.
In 1924 the Horlocks commissioned seven new steel Thames barges, of which "Xylonite" was the third. Six of these ‘seven sisters’ are still afloat: "Blue Mermaid" was lost to a mine in World War 2. They were built at Mistley. 
"Xylonite" was built in 1926 and delivered to Frederick William Horlock,(F.W. Horlock) who owned her for the first ten years. On 30 October 1936 "Xylonite" was sold to Marcus Frederick Horlock and Walter Richard Horlock. And on 31 October 1938 she was registered to M.F. Horlock and Company Ltd. Horlocks barges sailed under a blue burgee blazoned with a white maltese cross.
She was sold in August 1958 to The Greenhithe Lighterage Company Ltd and the Tester family. She was cut down to a motor barge, with all rigging removed and a new wheelhouse. The rear hold was modified to take a diesel engine. She carried cargo until June 1977.
From 1977 to 1984 she was owned by Tim and Brigid Eliff. They restored her to sail and rerigged her and she was run as a charter barge from the alongside the Prospect of Whitby pub in Wapping. She was chartered to Hoseasons, and carried purple coloured Duradon sails. The topmast was made from steel and would often buckle.
For the next twenty-two years, from 1984-2007 she was run by the Cirdan Trust, who used her to give sailing experiences to underprivileged children. This trust was run by Bill Broad, an Anglican churchman, his wife Daphne and John Corder Belfrage. The barge skipper Rebecca Polden and her partner bought her next, and did some serious restoration work and sold her on in summer 2011. They used her as a houseboat at Maylandsea.
Tim Kent, a London based photographer operated her between 2011 and 2016 on the Medway and the London River. 
She is currently owned by Chris Palmer and based in Limehouse 
The United Kingdom Official Number was 145408
A replica of the "Blue Mermaid" is being constructed, and she was launched 28 May 2016 for the Sea-Change Sailing Trust. She will operate out of the Heybridge Basin.

Verdensparken

Verdensparken is a park on in Furuset, Oslo, Norway which opened in 2013 and was completed in 2014. The park reflects the population of the suburb of Furuset, where 63% of inhabitants had an ethnic origin other than Norwegian in 2009, and immigrants came from around 140 countries. In Verdensparken, there is a space to practice parkour.
Location, landscape, and background of the new park.
The park lies on the west side of Gransdalen in Furuset, west of the Furustien walkway which runs between Furuset centre and Gransdalen Road. The Vesterstien walkway runs through the park. The park is to the north and west of Gran school and Gran nursery Verdensparken is part of the walking route network as Vesterstien, which runs through the park, is a part of route D7, which runs from Furuset church to Stovner. Vesterstien is part of the Pilgrim's Route from the Middle Ages, which is now marked and recreated.
The park is in terrain with ravines forming oval landscapes south of the park area. The banks are covered with birch and pine trees which are partially planted. The grass banks follow the ravine forms and run over into short-trimmed lawns to the North and East. The vegetation is limited to a few species, mainly birch and pine, with a few poplars. Much of the vegetation was planted in the 1980s, when the suburb was first growing. The large spaces lacked intimacy, and were therefore not used much for picknicking, for example. The area of the park is mostly green space. The park was little used, and became a "green desert" with little variation in character and contents. The traffic on Furustien, which borders the park to the East, is likewise heavy, with 1400 people per day.
The layout of the park was based on a study undertaken in 2008, planning in 2009, and continued housing analysis through the project. The municipality consulted with residents of Furuset, with particular focus on seeking the needs and wishes of women and youths. . One of the most common requests from the people of Furuset was a good meeting place outdoors. Verdensparken is the first project in a new collaboration between the Norwegian State Housing Bank and the Norwegian Environment Agency (formerly the Directorate for Nature Management), on the improvement of the local area. The park is part of the area improvement for Furuset in the Groruddalssatsingen. Each of the four districts were given a new large park, and Verdensparken is Alna's park.
The name of the park reflects the cultural diversity of the suburb, joined with the UN's message of peace, and Trygve Lie, the UN's first general secretary, who grew up in Furuset.
Layout of the park.
The meeting places in the park link new and existing vegetation. The ravines create interesting spaces and soft spaces, which are used to make attractive meeting spaces and seating areas. The ravines also create areas for sports activities and physical exercise in the winter time.
Physical activities which were formerly linked to permanent spaces and organisations moved to open spaces in the park, and organise activities themselves.
In Verdensparken, the municipality has supported the use of new green spaces.
The parkour areas (free running) are a project by Kragh &amp; Berglund landscape architecture and urban design in Copenhagen. The most important elements of the space are concrete walls and staircases, padded rubber bins, plastic pads and rails. Parkour is not usually specially built in urban areas. The parkour area was opened by Environment Minister Bård Vegar Solhjell and councillor Bård Folke Fredriksen on 31 May 2013.
The park contains seven meeting places with paving and benches, barbecues, bonfires, fruit trees, and fruit and berry bushes. These are of varying sizes, and are located throughout the park. There is a roof over the long table in meeting place nr. 4. In one of the ravines in the middle of the park, there is a stream ending with a dam. On the dam, an amphitheater has been built with seating areas and stone artwork. A former track has been upgraded to a tourist route with paving. The first to be built were benches, fruit trees, seating areas and parkour equipment throughout the park. At the bottom of Verdensplassen is a lake landscape. The whole park is dealt with in a similar way, a mini-landscape with valleys, streams, rivers and bushes, reinforced by the use of natural elements such as stone, vegetation and water, but without typical play apparatus. Visual inspiration for this came from the Danish landscape architect Helle Nebelong, who has designed a variety of play areas and sensory gardens, including in Copenhagen. The overflow from the water areas leads into a stream to Gran school.
The lighting is provided by ÅF lighting. The lighting in Verdensparken has a distinctive and special design. In the amphitheater, stone benches look like a starry sky. Foot and cycle paths are lit without blending and have good colour separation. The lighting turns off at 11:00 p.m., so that the lights do not disturb the park's neighbours.
The lighting was awarded the Norsk Lyspris 2013, and the jury wrote. ""The way the light is used gives the park a new meaning in the evening, a new layer of meaning emerges at the time of darkness. The park is divided into different "experience zones", which contributes to variety, curiosity and movement.""
Art is central to the design of "Verdensplassen", which lies to the lowest, northeast, corner. The placement and size of the square make this area of the park more active, as it was previously a sad area of asphalt. Verdensplassen has its own character from site-specific art in combination with the creation of a social meeting place for people in the suburb and other arrangements. The floor of the square is made as a carpet of mosaic which is meant to reflect the people of Furuset, and inspirations include the Selburose, African graphics, and Persian carpets.
Verdensparken is 52 decares large, around 400 meters at the longest point North-South, and the ground is owned by the municipality. The park is regulated for free use, apart from a small area that is specifically a walking and cycleway. The park is financed by the state and the Directorate for Nature Management (from 2013 the Environment Directorate), Oslo municipality through the Groruddals initiative and the station and meeting places project, and the Sparebankstiftelsen DNB NOR. The park had a budget of 41 million kroner, and work was done in three stages. The builders were Oslo municipality through Frluftsetaten (later the City Environment Office) and Bydel Alna, the Open Air Office had the project lead, while Sundt and Thomassen landscape architects AS project managed the park.

Buster Welch

Buster Welch (May 23, 1928), born near Sterling City, Texas, is a cutting horse trainer and inductee into the NCHA Members Hall of Fame, American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame, National Cutting Horse Association Riders Hall of Fame and Texas Cowboy Hall of Fame. Buster was chosen as the recipient of the 2012 National Golden Spur Award for his "outstanding contributions to the ranching and livestock industry".
Buster won the NCHA World Championship four times, and the NCHA World Championship Futurity five times. The most notable horses he trained include Marion's Girl, Chickasha Mike, Money's Glo who he trained and in 1962 won the first NCHA World Championship Futurity, in 1963 he won it on Chickasha Glo, in 1966 on Rey Jay's Pete, in 1971 on Dry Doc, and in 1977 on Peppy San Badger. He won the NCHA World Championship on Marion's Girl in 1954 and 1956. He trained Mr San Peppy and won the NCHA World Championship in 1974 and 1976.
Early life.
Buster Welch was born on May 23, 1928, near Sterling City Texas. Buster's ancestral heritage dates back to Tennessean roots and family settlements in Texas before the Civil War. He was born and raised to early childhood near the divide of the Colorado and Concho Rivers, north of Sterling City, Texas. His mother died shortly after his birth, leaving his grandparents to raise him for a time on their stock farm. His father remarried, and moved the family to Midland, Texas, where he worked for Atlantic Richfield. While still in grade school, Buster had run away from home several times, and would skip school to spend time at the stockyards where he learned to ride broncs. At age 13, he left home permanently and landed a job breaking horses, working large herds of cattle, and tending to various other ranch chores for cattlemen, Foy and Leonard Proctor, in Midland, Texas. It was there that Buster learned the basics of riding and working cattle that followed him into adulthood.
After leaving Proctor's, Buster worked for many prominent ranches such as the 6666 Ranch, Pitchfork Ranch, King Ranch, Long X, and a few other ranches where he developed his skills working with rough stock and cattle. His goal was to one day have a ranch of his own.
Personal life.
In the early 1980s, Buster and his wife Sheila, lived and worked in Kingsville, Texas, on the King Ranch. Sheila rode cutting horses and competed in cutting horse competition. She won several championship titles, and earned over $1 million in NCHA earnings. In the late 2000s, they sold their 25,000 acre Double Mountain River Ranch, and moved to the adjacent 18,000 acre Chriswell Ranch. They eventually moved to Rotan, Texas, and raised cattle under the "B Lazy W" brand to supply the retail demand for naturally fed beef. Buster continued to train cutting horses and managed to expand the ranch to include both leased and owned land comprising over 60,000 acres.
Sheila died on December 7, 2014, at age 76.
Career.
When he was 18 years old, Welch took advantage of the new National Cutting Horse Association, and by the early 1950s had begun to establish himself as a horseman able to train a horse to "some degree of finish". Also, cutting horses had begun to really make their mark as contest livestock. Welch had always planned to establish himself in cattle ranching and was running 800 head on leased land when a drought "focused his options".
One of the locations where Welch worked for a ranch was for Homer Ingham in Las Vegas, New Mexico. Welch claims that Ingham, "gave me my first real opportunity in training horses". Welch broke and trained horses for him and also for Warren Shoemaker, his neighbor. On Shoemaker's urging, Welch decided to purchase a six-year-old unbroken stallion named Chickasha Mike for $125 from Ingham. Chickasha Mike was by American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame sire Billy Clegg. Welch broke Mike, used him in his ranch work, and for cutting. Since the horse seemed to have an aptitude for cutting, Welch took him to some local contests. In 1952, Mike won his first five events. Awhile later Welch sold Mike to Bill Hale of Odessa, Texas, for $8,500, and Hale sold him to Leonard Proctor, Welch's previous employer.
Welch's first competition on a cutting horse was on Chickaska Mike. By showing Chickasha Mike as a cutting horse, Welch established the horse, an American Quarter Horse, as a notable sire of cutting horse champions. Due to Welch's training, Chickasha Mike became the 1956 NCHA Reserve World Champion. Proctor owned the horse when he won the 1956 NCHA Reserve World Championship.
An oilman named Marion Flynt of Midland, Texas, saw Welch's first competition on Chickasha Mike. Flynt was impressed enough to send Welch his best mare, Marion's Girl, by Silver Wimpy and out of Scharbauer mare, to train. The mare was foaled in 1948. Flynt had purchased the mare from her breeder, prominent rancher Clarence Scharbauer Jr., when she was 2 years old for $2,000. She won back $1,677 of her purchase price in one of her first competitions. Welch took the mare from coast to coast to campaign her when she was 6 and 8 years old. Under Welch's tutelage and expert riding, Marion's Girl won the NCHA World Championship in 1954. They gave her a year off to rest in 1955. Then, in 1956 she and Welch won the title again. The mare won a career total of $35,000, which would be significant earnings when adjusted for higher purses awarded now. Welch called her the smartest and best cutting horse he ever rode. The mare died when she was 9 years old and never produced any foals.
In 1960, Welch trained a horse named Jessie Jack owned by C.E. Boyd, Jr. of Houston, Texas; he rode the horse to win the NCHA World Champion Stallion title.
In 1962, Welch and other competitors started the NCHA Futurity. The NCHA Futurity is an event for 3-year-old horses who have not been shown before. In 1962, the NCHA Futurity held its first event at the Nolan County Coliseum in Sweetwater, Texas. Welch rode Money Glo, owned by C.E. Boyd, III, in the event. The duo marked 224 to win, earned $3,838.12, and the status of having won the first event. Money Glo's sire, King Glo, owned by C.E. Boyd, Jr. brought his owner a $1,000 Breeders Award.
From 1962 to 1963, Welch served on the NCHA's Executive Committee; he also served as an NCHA director.
In 1963, Welch marked 218 on Chickasha Glo in the NCHA Futurity for a second straight win. They won $4,277, which was a new record for a cutting horse. Chickasha Glo was also sired by King Glo, and Boyd earned a second consecutive $1,000 Breeders Award. In 1964, he placed fifth riding Glo Doc.
By November 1965, Money Glo had a new owner, Repps Guitar. Repps Guitar had Welch take Money Glo to the NCHA Finals in Las Vegas, Nevada. There were at least 77 horses competing for the championship. Welch won the first round, tied for third place in the second round, and tied for fourth place in the average. Welch returned home after the championship ended and decided to open his own cutting horse school, which attracted students from across the US and as far away as Australia. At the time, Welch was living in the Ranch, right outside of Roscoe, Texas. He was also leasing two ranches, the former C.E. Boyd, Jr. Ranch and the L.S. Howard Ranch. He was operating and managing three ranches, managing and showing horses, and running a cutting school.
In 1966, Welch marked 218 points on Rey Jay's Pete in the fifth NCHA Futurity in his third win of the event. The event now showcased 336 horses compared to the 47 that had been nominated in the inaugural event. The purse was now nearly four times its original amount. The horse, Rey Jay's Pete was sired by Rey Jay. He was unregistered and owned by Kenneth Peters of Fort Wayne, Indiana. "Rey Jay's Pete was an outstanding horse, really a true cow horse," Welch said. They won the race by two points Waddy Wolf and Leroy Ashcraft. Welch broke the winnings record again with $9,353.
In 1971, Welch rode Dry Doc for a record fourth win in the NCHA Futurity. Dry Doc was a full brother to the previous champion, Doc O'Lena, and was by Doc Bar out of Poco Lena. He was bred by Dr. &amp; Mrs. Stephen Jensen. "Dry Doc was a little athlete and could really run, stop, get back and hold a cow", Welch said. The NCHF was now ten years old. The purse had grown from $18,375 to $112,000.
In 1974, Welch rode the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame horse cutting horse Mr San Peppy for the King Ranch to an NCHA World Championship. In 1976 Welch again rode him to another NCHA World Championship. In 1976, Welch rode Mr San Peppy in senior cutting to win an AQHA World Championship.
In 1977, Welch rode Peppy San Badger for a record fifth win in the NCHA Futurity. Peppy San Badger was bred by Joe Kirk and owned by the King Ranch. Nicknamed "Little Peppy" the horsed marked 220.5 under a new scoring system. "Little Peppy could be a real classy, pretty horse with lots and lots of style, and then he could immediately turn into a fierce working horse and hold bad, bad cows", said Welch. The pair also won the 1978 NCHA Derby, the 1980 reserve World Championship and the 1981 NCHA World Finals. Peppy San Badger in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame, his offspring earned more than $21 million, and he's ranked in the top 5 sires.
Dry Doc, Little Peppy, Peppy San Badger, and Mr San Peppy were all King Ranch horses that Welch trained and showed. Little Peppy and Mr San Peppy were bred on the King Ranch. In 1983, the King Ranch purchased Dry Doc. Welch had won the Futurity on Dry Doc and had also beat his son, Greg, who was riding Mr San Peppy.
In 1999, Welch suffered a stroke.
In 2010, Welch focused his attention on the rural population decline in the Ashland, Kansas, Public School District. The shrinking economy in rural towns always seems to force some residents to move away, which causes the number of students to decrease. Wanting to help the students, he and other cutting professionals put on a clinic and raised $13,000 for the District.
In 2011, in Fort Worth, Texas, Welch won the NCHA Futurity Champions Cup, a contest of returning NCHA Futurity winners. He rode Bet Hesa Cat, owned by Austin Shepherd.
Career summary.
Buster Welch has earned four NCHA World Championship titles (1954, 1956, 1974, 1976), and holds the record for the most NCHA World Championship Futurity titles with five wins (1962, 1963, 1966, 1971, 1977). He received a National Spur Award on September 7, 2012 in Lubbock, TX for his contributions to ranching and livestock industries.

James Frederic Riley

Dr James Frederic Riley FRSE FRCSE (2 May 1912–17 January 1985) was a 20th-century English physician, radiologist and cancer specialist. His identification (working jointly with Dr Geoffrey West) that the mast cell was the main producer of histamine in the human body resulted in his being made a Visiting Professor at the University of Montreal and to his being awarded the Claude Bernard Medal for medical achievement. He was one of the first to identify the link between mast cells and asthma and the potential use of antihistamines in this field.
Life.
He was born in Settle, Yorkshire on 2 May 1912. He was educated at Giggleswick School in Yorkshire.
He studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh, graduating with an MB ChB in 1935. In 1938 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. In the Second World War he served as Assistant Surgeon to the Scottish Emergency Medical Service, and for the final year served at the rank of Major with the OC Mobile Surgical Unit in India and Malaysia. Returning to Edinburgh he received his doctorate (MD) in 1946. However, despite intentions to be a surgeon, a skin complaint on his hands prevented his being a surgeon, and he instead retrained as a radiologist, with particular interest in the use of x-rays in cancer treatment.
In 1948 he took on the role of Consultant Radiologist at Dundee Royal Infirmary. In 1950 he took on the additional role of Reader in Radiotherapy at the University of St AndrewsMedical School in Dundee, which became part of Queens College Dundee in 1954 and from 1967 was part of the new University of Dundee. Riley retained the post of Reader until 1975, and was a research fellow at the University of Dundee from then until 1977. Much of his research at Dundee was devoted to the mast cell and this led to his discovery of the origins of histamine.
In 1958 he received a second doctorate (PhD), from the University of St Andrews. In 1968 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were George H Bell, Rex Coupland, Ian George Wilson Hill and James Ernest Richey.
He retired in 1976, and died in St Andrews on 17 January 1985.
Recognition and legacy.
In 2015 Dundee erected a plaque to his memory as part of the city's "Discovery Walk". His personal papers are held by Archive Services at the University of Dundee. Much of his original laboratory equipment is held by the Tayside Medical History Museum at Ninewells Hospital.

After a season with the Bandits, Don was signed to play left tackle for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1987. Pumphrey made several starts for the Buccaneers before being cut just before the 1988 season.
Career after football.
After being released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Don returned home to complete his bachelor's degree at Florida State University. Pumphrey graduated with his bachelor's degree in Criminology from Florida State University in 1989. That same year he applied for and qualified for the Florida Marine Patrol Academy and entered the academy where he was required to live while receiving intensive training under Florida Criminal Justice Standards, Defensive Tactics, Weapons training both on land and waterborne, National Marine Fisheries Training, Boat Captain Training, Customs search and boarding training, advanced tactical survival training, Federal Wildlife Officer training, marine survival techniques among others and the list goes on. After graduating and being sworn in as a State Police Officer by then Florida Governor Bob Martinez. Pumphrey requested duty assignments in South Florida working both Dade and Broward County in addition to off duty details with DEA and Customs. After service as a Full Time State Police Officer, Pumphrey took a reserve status and clerked in large law firm before attending Stetson College of Law. Don Pumphrey enrolled in Florida's first law school Stetson University College of Law, where he excelled in Trial Skills and Trail Advocacy. Pumphrey competed in the super competitive trial team selection process and secured a place on the Country's top rated trial team at the #1 School in the Country in Trial and Appellate Advocacy according to U.S. News and World Report at the time. Pumphrey graduated with a Juris Doctorate in 1996 and accepted another competitive position at the State Attorneys Office of the 6th Judicial Circuit working for State Attorney Bernie McCabe. While working as a young prosecutor, Pumphrey was approached and accepted a position coaching the trial team at Stetson College of Law (See Eleazer Law Review Article on the last 100 years of trial advocacy at Stetson). Pumphrey excelled as a young prosecutor averaging 25 jury trials a year with a high success rate. Pumphrey was promoted to supervisor of an entire division of prosecutors as the "Lead Trial Attorney" or LTA before being promoted again to Major Felonies and selection to the DUI Manslaughter Task Force (only 7 selected out of an office of more than 120 attorneys at that time) then spent several years working for the Pinellas County State Attorney's Office, where he was both the Assistant State Attorney and Lead Trial Attorney. Don also competed in and finished the Ironman Triathlon. 
Don works closely with accomplished physical therapist Kim Ortloff in order to treat his body for injuries from his NFL days and keep himself in shape for triathlons. Don has publicly stated his support and belief in stretch therapy for recovering from the physical duress a body goes through.
Criminal defense attorney.

Vera Barstow

Vera Barstow (June 3, 1891 – June 10, 1975) was an American violinist and teacher. She made a three-month tour playing for troops in France during World War I.
Early life.
Vera Barstow was born in Celina, Ohio, but described as being from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. She trained in Europe. Luigi von Kunits was one of her teachers.
Career.
Barstow had a busy performing schedule, beginning with appearances in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, and New York in 1912–1913 season. In 1916–1917 her tour of Canada was interrupted by an emergency surgery in Toronto. Of her 1917 appearance in Texas with Leo Ornstein, a critic reported that "Miss Barstow was delightful in every way and unquestionably one of the greatest women violinists we have heard."
In the spring of 1918, she toured Pennsylvania and Virginia, including a stop at Camp Lee with pianist Herma Menth, to play for American troops during World War I. She and Menth played gave further concerts for troops at Ellis Island and Camp Upton, working with the Stage Women's War Relief Society and the Jewish War Relief Society. She went to France to entertain the troops there for three months in 1918–1919. She described appearances of the all-female "Musical Foursome" at field hospitals and playing for German prisoners. "I have never seen so much mud in my life," she wrote. She also fell ill in the 1918 flu pandemic while in France.
Barstow made several recordings. Later in life, Barstow moved to southern California, where she taught private students in Pasadena and also at the California State University, Long Beach. Among her students were Akira Endo, Elizabeth Morgridge Mills, Arlene Gattuso, Stanley Ellison Plummer, and Eric McCracken. She also coached the string section of the Pasadena Symphony. She announced her retirement in 1962, but was still teaching in 1969. Isaac Stern was among the musicians performing at a gala concert in her honor in 1968, in Pasadena, with proceeds to fund a scholarship named for Barstow.
Personal life.
Vera Barstow married William Pinkney Lawson; they had a daughter. Later she married John H. Meyers. She was widowed in 1935. She died in 1975, aged 84 years.

Chromosome 1 open reading frame 112

Chromosome 1 open reading frame 112, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the C1orf112 gene, and is located at position 1q24.2. C1orf112 encodes for seventeen variants of mRNA, fifteen of which are functional proteins. C1orf112 has a determined precursor molecular weight of 96.6 kDa and an isoelectric point of 5.62. C1orf112 has been experimentally determined to localize to the mitochondria, although it does not contain a mitochondrial targeting sequence.
Gene.
The gene spans 192,073 base pairs, with 29 different exons. C1orf112 is located at position 1q24.2. C1orf112 shares antisense coding regions with C1orf156 and SCYL3.
Protein.
There are currently eight experimentally determined RefSeq isoforms. C1orf112 has a domain of unknown function DUF4487.
Composition.
Compositional analysis through SAPS predicted much less glycine and much more leucine than expected relative to other human protein sequences. This characteristic is conserved across primate orthologs. A mixed charge cluster was found in Isoform X1 from position 747 to 805, indicating that this segment may be aqueous and tightly bound. This mixed charge cluster is only partially conserved across orthologs
Transcripts.
C1orf112 is determined to have 9 transcripts, or splice variants by Ensembl.
Subcellular Localization.
Antibody immunocytochemistry and immunofluorescent staining of human cell line A-431 indicates C1orf112 is localized to the mitochondria.
Regulation.
Gene level regulation.
Expression.
Although tissue-level expression is ubiquitous, C1orf112 is expressed highest in the testes, lymph nodes, brain marrow, and cerebellum, with samples from 97 individual in 27 different tissues. In-situ hybridization of the human transcriptome indicates expression is highest in the atrioventricular node, followed by the testis, testis germ cells, and testis interstitial tissue.
Transcript level regulation.
Transcription factor assessment indicates many potential TATA-binding protein and CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins sites, along with transcription factors associated with the testis, thymus, kidneys, and cardiac tissue.
Protein level regulation.
There are two ubiquitination sites on C1orf112, at position lysine 73 and at position 783 on isoform X1. Downstream of reading frame, there are three polyadenylation signals. In addition, there is an N6-acetyllysine site at leucine 747 and a phosphoserine site at serine 23. C1orf112 has been found experimentally to interact with ATG1, an aldosterone secretion whose overexpression characterizes certain forms of breast cancer. Post-translational modifications predictions include O-glycosyl-oligosaccharide-glycoprotein N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and sumoylation, and sumoylation interaction sites.
Interacting proteins.
C1orf112 is predicted to interact with a diverse range of proteins, including multiple mitosis-associated proteins. C1orf112 is also predicted to interact with FIGNL1, a protein involved in DNA double-stranded break repair via homologous recombination. Experimental findings indicate C1orf112 interacts with NUF2, a spindle-pole body protein that plays a critical role in nuclear division, and TTK, a protein kinase capable of phosphorylating serine, threonine, and tyrosine.
Homology/evolution.
Paralogs.
There are no known paralogs of C1orf112.
Orthologs.
C1orf112 is highly conserved in "Pan troglodytes", "Rhinopithecus bieti," "Castor canadensis", "Miniopterus natalensis", and other select primates, with percent identity relative to "Homo sapien" C1orf112, with percent identity greater than 90%. Ortholgs with the greatest date of divergence (date of speciation) to human C1orf112 include "Trichosporon asahii", a placozoa, and "Amphimedon queenslandica," indicated that C1orf112 has been preserved over evolutionary time.
Date of divergence was calculated using TimeTree. The E value indicates the number of "hits" one can expect to see by chance when using the NCBI database, with a low E value indicated a significant result. Percent identity is the percentage of character that align to "Homo sapien" C1orf112 Isoform X1, while percent similarity is the degree of resemblance when the two sequences are aligned with one another.
Protein Structure.
Secondary and Tertiary Structure.
C1orf112 secondary structure is predicted to be predominately alpha helical, with &lt; 5% of the protein composed of beta sheets. Ligand binding sites are predicted by I-TASSER from positions 377 to 530 in Isoform X1. A leucine zipper motif is present in Isoform X1 from positions 831-852, predicted by MyHits.
Clinical significance.
C1orf112 was one of many genes found to be co-expressed with cancer-associated genes, and the knockdown of this gene in a HeLa cell line suppressed growth.

Mise Quadam

Mise Quadam (English: Mission Quadam) is a 1995 adventure video game developed by Agawa and published by JRC Interactive for the DOS platform. It was inspired by the German science fiction novel series "Perry Rhodan".
Production.
The game was developed by Petr Mandík and Petr Bartáček's company Agawa, which was devoted to games with sci-fi themes. Having met at work through their shared education field, Bartáček became acquainted with Mandík's game "" and was impressed by its gaming engine, and saw the potential of making better games. The graphics were created by an external graphic artist who drew pictures directly onto paper. Mandík and Bartáček subsequently scanned the images into the computers and gave them animations.
Aftermath and legacy.
Agawa released two games, both in the adventure genre: "Mise Quadami" (1995) and "Swigridova kletba" (1996). The company worked on two other adventure games: "Orientální dobrodružství" and "MMA", both due for release in 1998, but their release was cancelled, and a year later the company was disbanded. By this time, "Orientální dobrodružství" already had completed graphics, and the game engineers were preparing to use "Swigridova kletba"'s game engine, which required major changes to be applied to the new game. At the time "MMA" was only in the planning stage. The company folded as the Mandík and Bartáček decided to change careers.
"Mise Quadami" was the first Czech game to use anti-piracy protection, and also the first game which had a comprehensive manual attached, with terms and explanations of the game world. The manual asked players to describe colours apparent at certain points in the game, making it impossible to play in black-and-white. These features all came into wider use among other Czech games.
Plot and gameplay.
In the year 2360, androids have killed all humans on planet Earth and now they plan to destroy all the vegetation using an element called Cybertrone. A small group of human scientists have hidden on Matna Plus and developed a counter-device against Cybertrone called Sodomgomorhator. They send out many ships to take the device to Earth but the missions fail. David, the player, is their last hope.
In terms of gameplay, Mission Quadam is a sci-fi point-and-click adventure based around exploration, conversations and puzzles. The game has many pixel hunting puzzles. The inventory is located at the bottom of the screen. The gameplay is wholly controlled via the mouse and the player uses single click commands.
Critical reception.
The game has received mixed reviews from critics with Score from 30% to 65%. Reviewers agreed that this is a very professionally conceived work, and included many firsts, thereby advancing the Czech adventures gaming industry.
Vladimir Ponechal reviewed Mise Quadam for Excalibur magazine. Ponechal noted that first thing that caught his interest was well-crafted manual. He praised game's story and humor. Ponechal mentioned that game's protagonist David resembles Dempsey. He likened the game to titles by Pterodon such as Tajemství Oslího ostrova and 7 dní a 7 nocí. On the other hand, animation and graphics were criticised. Ponechal concluded that Mise Quadam can be compared to best Czech adventure games of the time. He noted that gameplay and idea can compensate for poor graphics.
Tomáš Landa of Level magazine gave Mise Quadam 50%. He stated that game is more difficult than it should be because game's graphics is confusing. He also mentioned that story seems illogical on the first sight. He noted that he understood the story when he played the game for second time. He also criticised poor graphics.
Andrej Anastasov wrote review for Score magazine. He was very critical and gave 30%. Anastasovv stated that the game is very amateur performed. He stated that every aspect of the game is bad. He criticised graphics as ugly and story as weird. He was critical of gameplay that is illogical.
Matěj Baran of Riki magazine gave 55%. He noted that the game reminds him of Terminator. He noted that graphics and music are poor. He also noted high difficulty which resulted in nervous experience. On the other hand, he stated that he enjoyed much fun playing the game.

Mahindra Roxor

The Mahindra Roxor is a 4x4 off-road only utility vehicle assembled by Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA) since 2018. MANA is the US arm of Indian automotive company Mahindra and Mahindra. It is based on the Mahindra Thar M2DICR variant, produced and sold in the Indian market since 2010. Mahindra has made off-road vehicles in jeep(GP) pattern since a 1947 contract with Willys to build such vehicles for Indian market.
The Roxor was announced in November 2017 and began sales on March 2, 2018. In the United States it is an off-highway side-by-side (SxS). The Roxor is assembled at Mahindra's factory that opened in March 2018 in Auburn Hills, outside Detroit, Michigan. Mahindra is the first new automaker to open a manufacturing operation in the Detroit area in almost 30 years. Roxors are assembled at the US Mahindra facility with about 50% local content, by value. They are sold through powersports dealers across US and Canada.
In June of 2020, the United States International Trade Commission ruled that the Roxor infringed upon Jeep's trade dress. This decision was accompanied by a limited exclusion order and a cease-and-desist order, effectively barring the import and sale of the Roxor in the US. Mahindra is redesigning the Roxor to further visually distinguish it from Jeep's vehicles. In December 2020, The International Trade Commission issued its final ruling and determined that Mahindra’s redesigned 2021 ROXOR does not infringe on the “Jeep Trade Dress” claimed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.
Design.
The Roxor is based on the design of the Jeep CJ of the 1960s, and Willys CJ of the 1940s. Mahindra was granted a license in 1947 to use the Jeep and CJ trademarks, and Willys originally shipped complete vehicle kits directly to Mahindra. Over time, the vehicles were localized in India. The body design and a significant portion of its mechanical architecture remain largely untouched. In the US off-road UTV market, it has a roll-over protection system (ROPS), which creates the upper body structure and is attached directly to the fully boxed frame. It has a single gauge speedometer on all variants, with digital fuel, odometer, and tachometer gauges.
The Roxor is available in two and four-passenger versions, and with either a manual or automatic transmission. It has 16-in steel or aluminum wheels, with options for Goodyear 235/70R16 Wrangler Trailrunner AT, BFGoodrich 235/70R16 All-Terrain T/A KO2, or EFX 30×9.5-16 tires.
Powertrain.
The Roxor is powered by the Mahindra M2DICR direct-injected turbodiesel engine that Mahindra claims produces @ 3,200 and torque at 1,400 rpm. The 18.6:1 compression ratio turbodiesel engine powered the Thar M2DICR and several other utility Mahindra vehicles excluding tractors. Starting 2019 model year Roxor, it is electronically limited to , and in the 2018 model to ensure safe off-highway use. Mahindra says the Roxor's fuel tank allows a range of and consumes . 
Drivetrain.
The NGT520 transmission was designed to military specifications. It has a cast-iron housing with a direct-mounted shift system. All of them forward gears are engaged with single-cone brass synchronizers. The simple gear lubrication system is efficient enough under driving conditions to allow limited flat towing of the vehicle over the road. The gears are helical involute. The dual-offset cast-iron transfer case is also based on early military specified driveline requirements. The 2.46:1 low range allows low crawl speeds over uneven terrain and steep grades. The leaf-sprung straight axles are of a legacy design close to Dana 44 with 3.73:1 final drive ratio. Since mid-2018, a 6L50 automatic transmission sourced from Punch Powerglide in Strasbourg, France, is offered as an option on the Mahindra Roxor. The transfer case has a plastic/rubber plug covering a PTO for potential stationary accessories. Both the front and rear differentials are open, allowing easier turning on hard surfaces, but power is sent to the wheel with less traction on loose or off-road surfaces. Several aftermarket suppliers offer traction locking differentials for both front and rear differentials, sending equal power to both wheels for greater traction off road. Additionally, horsepower output can be increased by retuning the ECU that controls the fuel/air mixture. Several aftermarket tuners will retune the ECU in accordance with any additional performance modifications undertaken, as in a less restrictive intake or exhaust. Intercoolers for the turbocharger are also available aftermarket, cooling the fuel/air mix for greater density and increased power. In Asian markets the Mitsubishi 2.5L diesel motor has been modified to produce in excess of 200 hp.
Trademark dispute.
Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, owner of the Jeep brand, filed a complaint in August 2018 with the U.S. International Trade Commission to halt sales in the US, saying the design infringed on FCA's copyrights. Mahindra and its Mahindra Automotive North America division filed a public interest statement with the trade commission on August 22, 2018, asserting that the recent complaint filed by FCA U.S. is without merit, and has begun proceedings in a Michigan court to enforce a design agreement that it claims to have executed with Fiat in 2009.
In late 2019, Judge Cameron Elliot ruled in favor of FCA, stating that the International Trade Commission should issue a limited exclusion order (to prevent Mahindra from importing Roxor vehicles or parts) and a cease-and-desist order (to block Mahindra from selling vehicles already in the US). On June 11, 2020, the U. S. International Trade Commission affirmed the decision. The ITC did not find that the Roxor's grill infringes upon Jeep's trademarked 7-slot grill. Rather, the vehicle overall infringes upon Jeep's trade dress used formerly in their CJ series vehicles, and currently on their Wrangler series vehicles. In particular, the Roxor has "a boxy body shape with flat vertical sides, rear body panels that are roughly the same height as the hood, the door cut-outs that go above the bottom of the side, exterior hood latches, a mostly flat and rounded-edge hood tapering toward the front... and the trapezoidal flared fenders that extend past the grille." 
While Mahindra has often highlighted the differences between the Roxor and the Jeep, the ITC ruling has caused them to embark on a redesign of the vehicle. Acknowledging the Roxor's similarities to Jeep vehicles, Rick Haas, Mahindra Automotive North America CEO and President, stated that the Roxor is "actually a CJ," and that "everyone understands that our vehicle is a CJ."
In December 2020, the International Trade Commission issued its final ruling and determined that Mahindra’s redesigned 2021 ROXOR does not infringe on the “Jeep Trade Dress” claimed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.

Patrice de Corsi

Patrice de Corsi (15 September 1824 – 13 October 1888) was a French magistrate and politician.
Early years.
Patrice de Corsi was born on 15 September 1824 in Talasani, Corsica.
He was among the Corsicans who were active in the Revolution of 1848.
In 1860 Corsi was a young advocate.
He was engaged in an electoral campaign in the canton of Pero-Casevecchio, where there had long been a feud between the Corsi and Renucci families.
During the evening of 13 June 1860, after dark, Corsi and two friends encountered a group of about 15 supporters of Antoine Renucci.
A stone was thrown and Corsi fell unconscious.
He revived in time to see one of his friends, Filippi "Prete-Vecchio", being shot dead.
At the subsequent trial the wrong man was convicted and served three years of a 20 year sentence before the error was discovered and the true culprit was assigned to the galleys, where he died.
Corsi became a magistrate.
In 1869 he was one of the co-founders of the weekly "La Revanche" with Vincent-Marie Farinole, Louis Tommasi and Léonard Limperani.
Political career.
Corsi was elected a general councillor.
In the 1876 legislative elections for the Bastia constituency Corsi won 4,367 votes against 8,790 votes for Eugène Rouher, who was proclaimed elected on 25 February 1876.
Corsi was president of the general council of Corsica at Bastia in 1888 when he ran for election to the senate.
The election was held on 22 April 1888 to replace Hippolyte Carnot, a life senator, who had died.
There was no clear winner of the first or second rounds of voting, but de Corsi was elected in the third round by 316 votes out of 719.
He sat on the left in the senate, and voted with the left for the new military law.
Patrice de Corsi died in office on 13 October 1888 in Paris.
He was succeeded by François Morelli (1833–1892), who also died in office.

Rescue Me (Thirty Seconds to Mars song)

"Rescue Me" is a song by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, featured on their fifth studio album "America" (2018). It was written and produced by Jared Leto and KillaGraham. "Rescue Me" was described as a song exploring themes such as pain, empowerment, faith, and freedom. Critics acknowledged eclectic influences that resonate throughout the track, including elements from dance-rock.
"Rescue Me" was released on June 15, 2018 through Interscope Records, as the third single from the album.
Background.
"Rescue Me" was written and produced by lead vocalist Jared Leto and music producer KillaGraham. It was engineered by Chris Galland and mixed by Manny Marroquin with the assistance of Scott Desmarais and Robin Florent. The song was recorded at The International Centre for the Advancement of the Arts and Sciences of Sound in Los Angeles, California and mastered by Howie Weinberg and Will Borza at Howie Weinberg Mastering. "Rescue Me" was officially revealed on March 22, 2018, at a press release for the announcement of the band's fifth album "America". The band premiered the song on Vevo on March 30, 2018, one week before the album's release. An earlier version of the song is performed by Jared Leto in the documentary film "Artifact" (2012).
Jared Leto explained that the lyrics of the song explores themes such as pain, empowerment, faith, and freedom. He further called it a song about "the brutal war so many of us wage against fear, depression and anxiety in the hope that we might, one day, live a life filled with happiness and dreams". Camille Heimbrod from "Music Times" felt that the song is "all about a person's plea to be saved from the demons in his head". Will Lavin from "Joe" acknowledged eclectic influences that resonated throughout the track, featuring elements from genres as varied as rock, pop and dance music. Alex Lai from Contactmusic commented that "beats, samples and electronics" provides the backdrop to Leto's "unmistakeable" vocals.
Music video.
A music video for the song was directed by Mark Romanek and premiered on June 12, 2018 on MTV. "Rescue Me" is the first video by Thirty Seconds to Mars that was not directed by Jared Leto since "This Is War" (2011). It was released after lead guitarist Tomo Miličević announced his departure from the band. The music video opens with close-up shots of various people of multiple races, ages and abilities, featured against a black background. Throughout the video, each person displays vulnerability through their emotions and feelings. The clip includes appearances from Paris Jackson, Sofia Boutella, Arrow de Wilde from Starcrawler, and one-handed model Julian W. Lucas.
Brent Furdyk from "Entertainment Tonight Canada" lauded the simplicity of the video and wrote that it "runs the gamut of emotions". A "Kerrang!" writer noted that it addresses mental health issues. Mackenzie Cummings-Grady from "Billboard" called it "visceral", while Joe Divita of "Loudwire" referred to it as "powerful". A "Malay Mail" writer considered it as "a message of hope for those suffering from emotional pain".
Live performances.
"Rescue Me" was included in the setlist of the band's Monolith Tour. On May 27, 2018, the band was joined on stage by Shawn Mendes to perform the song at BBC Music's Biggest Weekend. Jon O'Brien, writing for "Metro", deemed the performance a highlight of the festival. Thirty Seconds to Mars performed the song at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park in June 2018, which saw the band playing as headline act.

Treaty of New York (1796)

The Treaty of New York (1796) was a treaty signed on May 31, 1796, after negotiations in the City of New York between the United States and the Seven Nations of Canada. Under it, the Native Americans in question gave up, for compensation, all claim to land in New York State. There were three signed copies: for New York State, the United States, and the indigenous peoples. The United States copy was lost in the fire of 1800 that destroyed the records of the Department of War (the National Archives did not exist until 1934), codified in 1845 in Volume 7 of the United States Statutes at Large as , land cession area enumerated as "28" by Charles C. Royce ("Royce Area 28") in 1899, then placed in a compendium published by the Government Printing Office in a 1904 volume of Indian treaties. In the New York State Archives are receipts from the Seven Nations for money paid under the treaty.

SK Kakraba

SK Kakraba is a Ghanaian musician and performer of the country's traditional music. He makes and performs gyils, a xylophone containing 14 suspended wooden slats stretched over calabash gourds containing resonators. He was taught to build the instruments using a rare wood known by the Lobi as "neura". Kakraba explained: "It's a very hard process, because you have to get the wood from five different places, only found in Ghana’s forests. The trees fall on their own and when they do, you cut them, dry the wood and lay the keys." "LA Weekly" have referred to Kakraba as the "world's greatest" xylophone player, 
and he has toured worldwide playing the gyil.
Kakraba grew up in Saru, a small village in Ghana where the gyil is held in great respect by the Lobi tribe. It is played at funerals to "help the souls of the dead reach the afterlife," and is a primary instrument of other Northern Ghana cultures like the Sisala and Dagara. Kakraba's parents also played the gyil, as did other relatives, including his uncle Kakraba Lobi, who is considered by many to be among the instrument's greatest practitioners. In 1997,Kakraba moved to Accra and began busking, and soon joined the group Hewale Sounds, who aimed to preserve and familiarise the traditional music of Ghana. Kakraba has taught the gyil at the University of Ghana's 'International Centre for African Music and Dance.'
In September 2013, his band the SK Kakraba Band released a self-titled album as a cassette on Holy Page. It was ranked at number 1 on "Fact Magazine"'s list of "the 20 best cassette releases of 2013", with Brad Rose of the publication writing: "This music has serious soul. Everything about these tunes is purely ecstatic." The solo album "Yonye" was released July 2015 by Sun Ark Records, a label run by experimental musician Sun Araw as a splinter label to Drag City. Recorded after Kakaraba's arrival in the United States, it contains solo recordings and traditional pieces.
"Songs of Paapieye" followed in October 2015, released by Awesome Tapes From Africa as the label's first non-reissue release. The album contains six solo, instrumental recordings, spanning Kakraba's "favourite song cycles, funeral dirges, improvised interpretations on traditional songs and original compositions." It departs from "Yonye" in that it is smoother in sound and is an album of solo recordings as opposed to a group recording. "Songs of Paapieye" was recorded in a San Francisco studio belonging to Kakraba's close friend Brian Hogan. As a solo project, the album was recorded by Kakraba entirely by himself, playing live without any overdubs or accompanying guest musicians. This differentiated the project from the traditional setting for gyil music, where two gyil players may play together with accompaniment from drums, bells and sometimes singing. On 10 April 2016, he played an acclaimed performance at The Ampersand Salon.
Kakraba currently lives in Highland Park, Los Angeles, having moved to the city in 2012.

Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University

The Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University () is the sixth oldest medical school in Thailand located in Hat Yai District, Songkhla Province and is the fourth oldest faculty of Prince of Songkla University, opening in 1972 by royal decree.
History.
Due to a lack of medical and healthcare personnel in Thailand, as well as various healthcare issues in Southern Thailand, the council of Prince of Songkla University requested for the construction of a Faculty of Medicine on 11 September 1968. The project was approved on 17 August 1971 and construction began at the Hat Yai campus of the university. The first cohort of medical students was accepted in June 1973, consisting of 35 students. Teaching was done in the Faculty of Science for the preclinical years and Hatyai Hospital and Songkhla Hospital during the clinical years.
On 26 August 1976, King Bhumibol Adulyadej and Queen Sirikit laid the foundation for the construction of the faculty's main teaching hospital. Ten years later on 18 September 1986, the King and Princess Sirindhorn opened the hospital and named it 'Songklanagarind' Hospital. Songklanagarind Hospital has become the main teaching hospital since then.

Archives management

Archives management is the area of management concerned with the maintenance and use of archives. It is concerned with acquisition, care, arrangement, description and retrieval of records once they have been transferred from an organisation to the archival repository. Once records have been selected and transferred to archival custody, they become archives.
Managing archives.
The steps involved in managing archives include acquiring and receiving from the office of the origin, arranging and describing according to archival principles and practices, providing easy retrieval and access to archives.
Archives and accessibility.
An increasingly relevant aspect of archives management is ensuring the accessibility of archives and archive materials to all users regardless of physical ability. Most archivist and library associations now include resources on educating archivists on how to manage their archives to be more accessible. Both archivists and special collections librarians are faced with the issue of making their resources more accessible to the public, as their items were created prior to the consideration of accessibility.

Ann-Mari Kornerup

Emilie Anna Maria Kornerup née Bruzelius (1918–2006) was a Swedish-Danish textile artist who specialized in embroidery and tapestry. She produced works for decorating public buildings and churches, including the Danish Parliament and Roskilde Cathedral. Kornerup was also active as a teacher with the Haandarbejdets Fremme textile guild and the Danish School of Arts and Crafts.
Early life and education.
Born on 9 December 1918 on the island of Lidingö in Stockholm, Sweden, Emilie Anna Maria Bruzelius was the daughter of the pharmacist Niels Idar Carl Johan Bruzelius (1869–1952) and Jenny Maria Sandberg (1877–1961), a teacher. She was brought up in a well-to-do academic environment together with her four brothers and her twin sister. Her initial interest in textiles stemmed from her mother's weaving. From 1935, she studied first at Konstfack, then at the Textile Institute in Borås (1937–39) and finally from 1940 until 1944 at the Högre Konstindustriella Skolan (Higher Art and Crafts School). While still studying, she worked for a time at Elsa Gullberg's textile establishment in Vaxholm.
In 1946, she married the Danish architect Jørgen Ebbe Kornerup (1910–97) and moved with him to Denmark.
Career.
In 1951, Kornerup opened a weaving workshop in Charlottenlund where she produced tapestries and embroidered works, often creating scenes of everyday life, sometimes with children. In parallel, until 1961, she taught composition at Haandarbejdets Fremme, which had become a focus for Danish textile art. She also taught embroidery, sewing and weaving at the Danish School of Arts and Crafts (1960–73). As described in her "Broderiformning" (1969), she engaged in experimental teaching under the Gentofte municipal authority, using new materials for both adults and primary school children. For many years, she taught textile art in teachers training colleges. Her "Embroidery for Children" was published in English in 1971.
She exhibited her work from the 1950s in Denmark and abroad. Study trips until the 1970s in Europe, the Middle East and the United States widened her mastery of embroidery and weaving. She assisted with the management of the Artists' Autumn Exhibitions, becoming a central figure in Danish textile art. Her decorative work was commissioned for banks, hotels, public buildings, schools, churches and the Danish Parliament. Her work can be seen in the Danish Design Museum and in the Cooper Hewitt Museum in New York.
Ann-Mari Kornerup died in 2006.
Awards.
In addition to numerous grants and scholarships, Kornerup received the silver medal for the Venice Biennale in 1946 and first prize for the Haandarbejdets Fremme embroidery contest in 1963.

Magnús Jónsson í Vigur

Magnús Jónsson í Vigur (1637–1702) was a wealthy Icelandic landowner who is best known for his patronage of manuscripts and interest in Icelandic and foreign literature. Magnús is often referred to as Magnús í Vigur because his primary residence during his lifetime was at a farm on the small island of Vigur in Ísafjarðardjúp in the Westfjords of Iceland. He is also sometimes called Magnús "digri" (the stout).
Biography.
Magnús was born on 17 September 1637 in Vatnsfjörður in Vatnsfjarðarsveit in the Westfjords and died at Vigur on 23 March 1702 at the age of 64. Magnús's parents were the Reverend Jón Arason (1606–1673), minister at Vatnsfjörður and educated in Copenhagen, and Hólmfríður Sigurðardóttir (1617–1692). They married in 1636. Magnús was the first of nine children, with a 20-year age span from oldest to youngest. He had four sisters – Helga (1638–1718), Ragnheiður the elder (b. 1639), Ragnheiður the younger (1646–1715), and Anna (1650–1722) – and four brothers – Guðbrandur (1641–1690), Sigurður (1643–1730), Oddur (1648–1711), and Ari (1657–1698).
Magnús came from a powerful and wealthy family. In addition to being the son of a wealthy Lutheran minister, he was the great-grandson of two Lutheran bishops on both parents’ sides: on his father's side, Guðbrandur Þorláksson (d. 1627), Bishop of Hólar and famous for having the first Bible printed in Icelandic, known later as Guðbrandsbiblia; on his mother's side, Oddur Einarson (1559–1630), Bishop of Skálholt. Magnús was also the great-great-great grandson of Iceland's last Catholic bishop, Jón Arason of Hólar (1484–1550).
Education.
Magnús's father Jón Arason was not only a Lutheran minister, but a highly educated man who wrote both poetry (religious, secular, and rímur) and history (Vatnsfjarðarannáll) and also translated religious works into Icelandic. Jón studied at the University of Copenhagen in the 1620s after graduating from Iceland's northern Latin school at Hólar. Upon his return to Iceland, Jón was schoolmaster at the Latin school at Skálholt in southern Iceland from 1632 to 1635, before becoming a minister with his own parish, first at Staður in Reykjanes (1635), and then at Vatnsfjörður, where he settled and established his family.
Magnús himself was also formally educated, attending the Latin school in the south at Skálholt from 1652 to 1653, but he did not remain long enough to complete his studies. His abilities in Latin and other languages like Danish and German are reflected in the library of texts he later had, which included translations from these languages, some of which he is thought to have done himself.
Family and relationships.
On 6 September 1663, at the age of 24, Magnús married Ástríður Jónsdóttir, his 18-year-old second cousin. Their close kinship required a royal dispensation for the marriage to take place.
Both Magnús and Ástríður received substantial gifts of both fixed and moveable property from their families on the occasion of their marriage, including the farms of Ögur and Vigur from Magnús's father. Even so, after the wedding, Magnús lived with his bride and his in-laws for the first three years of the marriage. It was while living at Holt that Magnús translated "Ævintýr af einum mýlnumanni" ('Tale about a miller') into Icelandic from German in 1663, according to a note in the manuscript London, British Library Additional MS 4857. The couple moved away to Ögur not long after that in 1666. A few years later they set up their household in Vigur.
A letter dated 23 January 1672 is often cited as the earliest reference to Magnús and Ástríður living in Vigur, but they must have been there already three years earlier, if the 1669 dedication on the title page of the same manuscript just mentioned (London, British Library Additional MS 4857) is taken at face value.
Children.
Magnús and Ástríður had two daughters together. The first, Þorbjörg, was born in 1667, and the second, Kristín, in 1672. Both girls grew up to be literate women who seem to have appreciated reading and learning, and they both came to be influential in the preservation of their father's library of manuscripts.
In 1696 Þorbjörg married Páll Jónsson Vídalín (1667–1727), who is best known as Árni Magnússon's associate, with whom the Icelandic census of 1703 was carried out. Being of the same age, the two had met at Hólar around 1684, when Páll was studying at the Latin school and Þorbjörg was studying needlework under the tutelage of her aunt Ragnheiður, who then was married to Bishop Gísli Þorláksson of Hólar. Páll would later work closely with the manuscript collector Árni Magnússon. After his father-in-law's death, Páll inherited both property and some of Magnús í Vigur's manuscripts. Some of these manuscripts in turn came, through Páll, to belong to Árni Magnússon.
Magnús í Vigur did not live to see his younger daughter Kristín marry Snæbjörn Pálsson (c. 1677–1767) in 1706. Their time together was short, as Kristín only lived until 1714, aged 42. Snæbjörn came to be known as "Mála"-Snæbjörn (lawsuit-Snæbjörn), due to the several cases he was involved in against various people, including, in 1720, Páll Vídalín.
Divorce.
In addition to children with his wife Ástríður, Magnús was also father to an illegitimate child born in 1673, one year after Ástríður had given birth to their second daughter Kristín. After Magnús admitted to adultery with an unnamed woman working on the farm Vigur, Ástríður left Magnús and went to live with her father at Holt. With his help, she petitioned for a divorce from Bishop Brynjólfur Sveinsson (1605–1675) of Skalhólt, who was also her paternal grandfather's half-brother. Two letters were sent to him, dated 27 and 28 February 1674, just before the end of his time as bishop. Ástríður and Magnús were summoned to the court at the Althing in 1674 but it was still not yet settled. Ástríður wrote again to Brynjólfur in autumn 1674, and his reply of 12 April 1675, only four months before his death later that year, advised her not to return to Magnús. After this, the matter was taken up by Brynjólfur's successor, Bishop Þórður Þorláksson (1637–1697), and during his first visit to the Westfjords the case for divorce was considered and granted. Ástríður later lived at Mýri in nearby Dýrafjörður, eventually together with her daughter Kristín and son-in-law Snæbjörn. Ástríður died on 30 August 1719, at the age of 73.
After his relationship with Ástríður formally ended, Magnús had another child in 1681 with another mistress, Guðbjörg Jónsdóttir. Guðbjörg was then married to Jón Sigurðsson, a farmer who later worked at Skarð (one of Magnús Jónsson's farms, under the control of Ögur) and even at Vigur itself after Magnús's death. Magnús did not, however, publicly acknowledge his paternity of the child, named Sigurður, until 1686. Until then, the boy was considered to be Guðbjörg's son together with Jón Sigurðsson. When the truth was revealed, Magnús was fined and the record of this notes that the offence was Guðbjörg's first, and Magnús's second. Sigurður Magnússon only lived to his mid-twenties, almost certainly dying in the smallpox epidemic that broke out in 1707.
Remarriage.
Soon after his affair with Guðbjörg was made known, Magnús settled on the idea of marrying a second time. He sought a royal dispensation to marry Sesselja Sæmundsdóttir (born 1673), whose father, Sæmundur Magnússon, was magistrate at Hóll in Bolungarvík. Sesselja was one of seven of Sæmundur's children with his second wife Solveig Jónsdóttir. The dispensation for the marriage was issued in Denmark by King Christian V on 27 April 1688, when Sesselja was only 15 years of age; permission must have been sought by Magnús at least a year earlier. The dispensation reached Iceland later and was read at the Althing on 30 June 1691. The following year, 1692, the two were married, Sesselja 19 years old, and Magnús, 55. The couple did not have any children, and this marriage also seems to have been troubled as Sesselja was living again with her family only a few years later. Her uncle Árni Magnússon (c. 1625–1698) of Hóll in Bolungarvík petitioned to take her into his care. After his death, Sesselja appears to have lived with her father again, with her brother Sigmundur (c. 1675–c. 1737) as her legal guardian.
Patronage of manuscripts.
At the time of his death, Magnús had amassed an extensive library of Icelandic and foreign texts from medieval tales and sagas of all literary genres, to modern works on geography and ethnography that were being printed in early modern Europe, to poetry composed by his own family members.
The manuscripts associated with Magnús Jónsson í Vigur are significant because the texts preserved in them are thought to represent a snapshot of the literature available in Iceland at the time, and to provide insight into the country's early modern literary landscape and manuscript production practices: it has been said of just one of the manuscripts commissioned by Magnús Jónsson (AM 148 8vo, the famous miscellany known as "Kvæðabók úr Vigur"), that it "shows as though in a cross-section the type of poetry, both ancient and new, thought to be most current in Iceland in the late 17th century".
Many of the manuscripts in Magnús's library were copied by one or more scribes who worked in his service. However, Magnús himself also copied texts in several of the manuscripts in his library. The manuscripts containing Magnús's own writing are listed here, and all of them now are housed in two institutions in Reykjavík, Iceland (those with the shelfmark "AM" are in the Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies and those with the shelfmarks ÍB, ÍBR, and JS are in the National and University Library of Iceland):
The other manuscripts belonging to Magnús's library, but copied by other scribes, are housed in several different libraries today in addition to those in Reykjavík: these include the British Library in London, the Arnamagnæan Institute in Copenhagen, the Royal Library in Copenhagen, and the Royal Library in Stockholm.

Year of the Snitch

Year of the Snitch is the sixth studio album by experimental hip hop group Death Grips, released on June 22, 2018, through Third Worlds and Harvest Records.
Background.
With the release of "Steroids (Crouching Tiger Hidden Gabber Megamix)", Death Grips announced they were "working on the new Death Grips album". The band has made apparent via social media that they had been working with ambitious collaborators for the creation of the project throughout the promotion of the album, including in-studio collaborations with Australian experimental musician Lucas Abela, New Zealand film director Andrew Adamson and Justin Chancellor, bassist for the progressive rock band Tool.
The band posted a black and white image of text reading "Year of the Snitch - new album coming soon..." on their official webpage on March 22, 2018. Death Grips shared the album artwork for "Year of the Snitch" on April 6, 2018. The band's imprint label Third Worlds' website was also updated with this information.
The tracklist for the album was released on April 11, through a video posted to social media and the band's YouTube channel. The video consisted of the track names being sent via SMS to the user of an iPhone through a screen recorder, while short videos played in the foreground. Accompanying the differing ringtones, screamed vocals of the band's frontman MC Ride can be heard, coming from the album's last track, "Disappointed".
Death Grips uploaded a music video for the track "Streaky" on their YouTube channel on May 5, 2018, as the album's first single, followed by the track "Black Paint" on May 15, and the music video for the third album single, "Flies", on May 22.
The band posted a short video to Instagram on May 23, featuring DJ Swamp performing on a turntable in a recording studio, with the caption stating that "the majority of "Year of the Snitch" features [him]".
The fourth single, "Hahaha", was uploaded by the band to their YouTube page on June 7. That same day, the album's release date was announced as June 22. A music video for the track "Dilemma" featuring Andrew Adamson was uploaded on the Death Grips YouTube channel on June 15. A sixth single, "Shitshow", was uploaded to YouTube two days later. Three days later, on June 20, the official video for "Shitshow" was released. It was directed by Zach Hill and Galen Pehrson.
Interpretations.
The band has been notorious for their invocation of infamous cult-leader Charles Manson, stemming from their sampling of his voice in their debut mixtape "Exmilitary". Prior to the album's release, the title "Year of the Snitch" was speculated to be a reference to the 69th birthday of Manson Family member-turned-key witness Linda Kasabian. This theory is supported by the album's release date on June 22, one day after Kasabian's birthday, as well as the fourth track "Linda's in Custody", which seems to allude to her role in the Tate-LeBianca murders.
Critical reception.
"Year of the Snitch" received generally favorable reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 69 out of 100, based on 8 reviews. In his review for AllMusic, Rob Wacey claimed that "Not one of their releases is the same as another, and with "Year of the Snitch", they continue to break boundaries and expectations. The record is another example of true experimentation with their sound along with an uncompromising work ethic and a thirst for originality." Writing for "The Line of Best Fit", Steven Loftin called the band "one of the more exciting bands currently active" and described the album as "pushing every boundary around them". Ian Cohen of "Pitchfork" called the album "explosive" and "fun as hell", but "lacking in a clear target to give it meaning".
Christopher R. Weingarten of "Rolling Stone" named the song "Black Paint" as his 2018 pick for the magazine's "song of the summer" series.

A Bride for Rip Van Winkle

 is a 2016 Japanese drama film written and directed by Shunji Iwai, based on his novel of the same name.
Release.
After the film had its world premiere in Hong Kong on March 8, 2016, "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" was released in Taiwan on March 11, 2016 and in Hong Kong on March 17, 2016, ahead of its release in Japan on March 26, 2016. The film was released in the United States on November 10, 2017
"A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" was an official selection of numerous international film festivals:
Versions.
Two versions of "A Bride for Rip Van Winkle" were available for theatrical release, a 179-minute "director's cut" and a 119-minute theatrical version. Only the longer version was released in Japan, while both versions were available selectively for international release. Both versions were released in Hong Kong, whereas only the director's cut was released in the United States.
The film was also broadcast as a four-and-a-half-hour, six-episode television series ("serial edition") on the Japanese SKY PerfecTV! service's BS SKY PerfecTV! channel. While retaining the same story and plot, this television series is an alternate version of the film, with extensions for some scenes added and some scenes removed.
Iwai prefers the longer theatrical version, though he has stated that it is "not perfect. Even the TV version, the longest, isn't perfect because it doesn't have a very, very important scene in the climax. You can only see that in the three-hour version."

Palazzo Venturi, Florence

The Palazzo Venturi, once known as "Palazzo Doni" is a Renaissance-style palace located in central Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It located on via de' Banchi 2. The palace differs from the Palazzo Venturi Ginori on Via della Scala.
History.
The site was once the home of some houses belonging to the Bischeri family. In 1599, the Doni Family, who had acquired the site, commissioned the present structure from either Bernardo Buontalenti or Gherardo Silvani. The palace was inherited by the Bourbon del Monte, who sold it in 1667 to Cosimo Venturi, whose family also owned also the nearby palace on via de' Banchi 4. The Venturi family commissioned much of the interior decoration. The palace remained with the Venturi family until 1850, when it was sold to prince Ercole dei Pio of the Savoy Family. The palace is presently occupied by an inn.
The entrance to the palace still houses the heraldic shield of the Venturi, with three golden rocks on a blue background below the sign of the Anjou. The first floor has ceilings frescoed with grotteschi by Bernardino Poccetti.

Di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester

Di-deuterated ethyl linoleate (also known as RT001, di-deuterated linoleic acid ethyl ester, 11,11-"d2"-ethyl linoleate, or ethyl 11,11-"d2"-linoleate) is an experimental, orally-bioavailable synthetic deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), a part of reinforced lipids. It is an isotopologue of linoleic acid, an essential omega-6 PUFA. The deuterated compound, while identical to natural linoleic acid except for the presence of deuterium, is resistant to lipid peroxidation which makes studies of its cell-protective properties worthwhile.
Mechanism of action.
Di-deuterated linoleic acid is recognized by cells as identical to the natural linoleic acid. But when taken up, it is converted into 13,13-"d2"-arachidonic acid, a heavy isotope version of arachidonic acid, that gets incorporated into lipid membranes. The deuterated compound resists the non-enzymatic lipid peroxidation (LPO) through isotope effect — a non-antioxidant based mechanism that protects mitochondrial, neuronal and other lipid membranes, thereby greatly reducing the levels of numerous LPO-derived toxic products such as reactive carbonyls.
Clinical development.
Friedreich's ataxia.
A double-blind comparator-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial for Friedreich's ataxia, sponsored by Retrotope and Friedreich's Ataxia Research Alliance, was conducted to determine the safety profile and appropriate dosing for consequent trials. RT001 was promptly absorbed and was found to be safe and tolerable over 28 days at the maximal dose of 9 g/day. It improved peak workload and peak oxygen consumption in the test group compared to the control group who received the equal doses of normal, non-deuterated ethyl linoleate. Another randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study began in 2019.
Infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy.
An open-label clinical study for infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy evaluating long-term evaluation of efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of RT001, which, when taken with food, can protect the neuronal cells from degeneration, started in the Summer 2018.
Phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration.
In 2017, the FDA granted RT001 orphan drug designation in the treatment of phospholipase 2G6-associated neurodegeneration (PLAN).
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
In 2018, RT001 was given to a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) under a "compassionate use scheme".
Progressive supranuclear palsy.
In 2020, the FDA granted orphan drug designation RT001 for the treatment of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). PSP is a disease involving modification and dysfunction of tau protein; RT001’s mechanism of action both lowers lipid peroxidation and prevents mitochondrial cell death of neurons which is associated with disease onset and progression.
Preclinical research.
Alzheimer's disease.
RT001 has been shown to be effective in a model of Alzheimer's disease in mice.

Die beiden Kalifen

Die beiden Kalifen (The Two Caliphs) is an 1813 opera in two acts by Giacomo Meyerbeer (or as he was then known, Jacob Meyerbeer), to a libretto by Johann Gottfried Wöhlbruch, based on a tale from the "Arabian Nights".
The opera, Meyerbeer's second attempt at this genre, was originally titled "Wirt und Gast, oder Aus Scherz Ernst" (Landlord and Guest, or The Joke which Became Serious). Under this name it was premiered at the on 6 January 1813, conducted by Conradin Kreutzer. Meyerbeer noted in his diary that "I arrived one day before the performance, and was able to supervise two rehearsals, but could do nothing to help really, since in every respect it had been badly and hurriedly prepared. The production was judged as poor by all critical accounts, and the opera was received very tepidly." The local press however reported that the opera "earned a deserved success. The music has striking, genuinely original passages, and the text has been diligently prepared."
The opera was given a single performance as "Die beiden Kalifen" during the Congress of Vienna at the Theater am Kärntnertor in Vienna on 20 October 1814. At this performance the role of Irene was sung by the soprano Cathinka Buchwieser.
The failure of the opera was a major factor in Meyerbeer determining to leave for Vienna in November 1814 and to seek his career outside German-speaking Europe. In a review, the English journal "The Harmonicon" commented: "At this period no music but Italian had a chance of being listened to in the Austrian capital; it is not to be wondered at, therefore, that Meyerbeer's opera, written upon an opposite principle and very nearly in the same style with his "Daughter of Jeptha", failed completely."
The opera received further performances in Prague (22 October 1815), and, under the name "Alimelek, oder die beiden Kalifen", in Dresden on 22 February 1820. Both these performances were conducted by Meyerbeer's friend Carl Maria von Weber, who wrote of its "active imagination. [and] well-nigh voluptuous melody", and praised its instrumentation.

Marlon Bundo

Marlon Bundo, also known as Bunny of the United States (BOTUS), is a rabbit, belonging to the family of Mike Pence, the 48th and former Vice President of the United States.
Bundo was initially adopted for a film project by Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence during her freshman year. His name is a pun on actor Marlon Brando, chosen after Bundo's previous owner said "Make me an offer" when Pence asked about his price. He is the first rabbit to travel on Air Force Two, has a popular Instagram account, and is the subject of two children's books.
Biography.
The rabbit Marlon Bundo was named after actor Marlon Brando and lived with the Pence family at the United States Naval Observatory from 2017 until 2021. Other pets owned by the second couple include an Australian Shepherd named Harley, and two cats named Hazel and Pickle.
Marlon Bundo was acquired via Craigslist by Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence in 2013 when she was a freshman at DePaul University. At the time she needed a rabbit for a short film student project. In the film, Bundo portrayed a "symbol of rebellion in a world of conformity" as a rabbit who repeatedly escapes from his cage. Before this, Bundo was "just another scrappy Chicago bunny".
Pence texted Bundo's owner to ask how much the rabbit cost, and the owner replied, "Make me an offer." In Mario Puzo's novel "The Godfather" and the 1972 film of the same name, Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone says, "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." Pence's friend, a Brando fan, noticed the similarity between the seller and Corleone, and suggested naming the rabbit Marlon Brando. Pence finally decided to name him Marlon Bundo. Speaking to "The Chicago Tribune" Charlotte recalled:
We drove out to the suburbs, my friends and I, and we picked him up. I think he was like $20. He was in the short film, and I just kept him after that.
Bundo lived with Charlotte throughout college in Chicago, for four years, and was part of a student friends group.:2:19 Bundo traveled to Washington, D.C. from his home in Indianapolis, Indiana aboard Air Force Two in January 2017, making him the first rabbit to ever travel on the plane. He made his official debut in May 2017, appearing at an event honoring Military Appreciation Month at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, where he was "admired", according to the official transcript of the event.
Bundo was featured on the White House's Flickr landing page on May 11, 2017, detailing his first trip to the White House. Bundo has not been in the Oval Office, .:7 President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump met Bundo at a dinner at the Naval Observatory. Melania Trump invited Karen and Charlotte Pence to read their book at the 2018 White House Easter Egg Roll, but the Pences did not accept because they – and Marlon Bundo – were taking a "mini-spring vacation". Karen Pence said, "You have to have the bunny on Easter."
The Pence family originally drew criticism online and questions regarding their care for Bundo, based on the observation that his nails were "far too long". As Callie Beusman, a senior editor with Vice Media commented:
The Pence family cannot claim ignorance on these issues because insane rabbit people (including myself) frequently comment on Marlon Bundo's Instagrams with alarm and concern.
The piece went on to observe that "BOTUS otherwise seems well-loved". The White House press office did not respond to a related request for comment on the matter. "The Washington Post" later observed that Bundo "promptly got a pedicure".
Social media.
Bundo has his own Instagram account, which has over 33,000 followers . Charlotte created his Instagram account after her father's inauguration, "not knowing if anybody would follow it". Four former U.S. presidents have had rabbits; Bundo is the first in such circles with a social media account.
According to "The Fresno Bee", Bundo generally avoids partisan politics online, preferring instead to stick to "posting pictures of his bunny life, including being hugged by his mom, Charlotte Pence, the vice president's ... daughter, hopping around the house, and playing hide and seek with Pickle, the family cat". Photographs on Bundo's Instagram account show him "reading the Constitution, taking phone calls, signing documents, and working out on the treadmill". Because of Bundo's popularity on Instagram, Charlotte and Karen decided to create a children's book about him.
Children's books.
Bundo is the main character in two children's books.
"Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President" features Bundo accompanying Vice President Pence through his daily activities as seen from Bundo's perspective. It is written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence. Bundo posed for all illustrations in the book.:28 As of March 2018, Bundo was scheduled to accompany Charlotte and Karen on the press tour for the book. Proceeds from the book benefit Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program, and The A21 Campaign, which works to combat human trafficking. As of late March 2018, the book had sold approximately 100,000 copies, entered the top-ten books on Amazon, and was the No. 7 Children's Picture Book on "The New York Times" Best Seller list.
"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" is a book published by the television show "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver". It was written as a parody of "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President". It details a gay romance between Marlon Bundo and a rabbit named Wesley. Authorship is attributed to Bundo as well as Jill Twiss. In response to the release of the parody, Marlon Bundo's Instagram account made a post featuring a photo of him wearing a bow tie nearly identical to the one worn by the bunny in the book. The photograph was accompanied by comment from the account reading: "Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity. #BOTUS - Marlon" Proceeds from the book benefit The Trevor Project, which operates a crisis hotline for members of the LGBTQ community, and AIDS United. As of late March 2018 the book had sold approximately 400,000 copies, spent several days as the top-selling book on Amazon, and was the No. 1 Children's Picture Book on "The New York Times" Best Seller list.
Reception.
In December 2017, President of the United States Donald Trump reportedly described the presence of Bundo and the other family pets in the Vice Presidential residence as "low class". Writing for "Jezebel", Ellie Shechet acknowledged Bundo's cuteness, but continued that it is "an indisputable fact that underneath his huge blinky eyes and nice fat tummy lies the twisted heart of a dirty trickster", and further accused him of using his "good looks and pleasant demeanor as a fluffy tool of mass obfuscation".
"The Washington Post" praised Bundo as "ridiculously cute" and "a natural actor". Others have called him the "only positive thing in Washington, D.C." Writing in "Vogue", Bridget Read summarized Bundo as "clearly a lover, not a fighter, based on how much he loves snuggling", but also that he is "clearly not new to navigating his own PR, and has demonstrated some media training". Read concluded by saying that Bundo's "social media rollout" may be an indication that he is planning to run for public office. Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres, comedian John Oliver described Bundo as a "fantastic rabbit", adding, "if you have a problem with that bunny you're dead inside".

Campanula (horse)

Campanula (1931 – 1947) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. In 1933 she won two of her five races including the Windsor Castle Stakes and the Moulton Stakes and was rated the best juvenile filly in England. In the following spring she won the Column Produce Stakes and then recorded her biggest win in the 1000 Guineas. In her two subsequent races she finished fourth in the Epsom Oaks and second in the Champion Stakes. As a broodmare she exerted an enduring influence as a broodmare through her daughter Calluna.
Background.
Campanula was a bay mare with a white star bred and owned by George Bullough. She was trained throughout her racing career by Jack Jarvis at the Park Lodge stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. Physically she was described as a "beautiful" and "very charming" filly, but somewhat lacking in size and range.
She was sired by Blandford an Irish-bred stallion who won three of his four races including the Princess of Wales's Stakes. He went to become an outstanding breeding stallion who was a three-time Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland and whose other offspring included Bahram, Blenheim, Brantôme, Udaipur and Windsor Lad. Campanula's dam Vesper Bell was descended from the influential British broodmare Perseverance (foaled 1865) by Voltigeur.
Racing career.
1933: two-year-old season.
After finishing fifth on her racecourse debut, Campanula ran second by a neck to the colt Colombo in the First Spring Stakes at Newmarket in late April. At Royal Ascot in June 1933 Campanula defeated male opposition to take the Windsor Castle Stakes and was described as one of the best juveniles seen at the meeting. She sustained a minor injury in September and missed an intended run in the Champagne Stakes at Doncaster, but returned to the track to win the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket, carrying top weight of 131 pounds.
In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best two-year-olds, Campanula was rated the best filly, seven pounds behind Colombo who was the top colt.
1934: three-year-old season.
Campanula began her second season in the Column Poduce Stakes at Newmarket in April and won by a short head from the colt Bright Bird, to whom she was conceding twelve pounds. On 4 May, ridden by Harry Wragg, she started 2/5 favourite for the 121st running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile. The best of her nine rivals appeared to be Light Brocade who was owned by George Bullough's son-in-law John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. Campanula prevailed by a length from Light Brocade, with six lengths back to Spend A Penny in third.
A month later, Campanula, with Wragg again in the saddle, was strongly fancied to win the Oaks Stakes over one and one-half miles at Epsom Racecourse. Looking "keen and anxious" before the race she started poorly and never looked likely to win and finished fourth behind Light Brocade, Zelina and Instantaneous. After a four-month break Campanula returned in October for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October and finished second to the Aga Khan's colt Umidwar.
Campanula earned a total of £7,433 in 1934.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Campanula a "superior" winner of the 1000 Guineas and the best British filly of her generation.
Breeding record.
After her retirement from racing Campanula became a broodmare and produced at least eight foals between 1936 and her death in 1947:

Koji Komuro

 is a Japanese judoka and amateur mixed martial arts fighter.
Taught by kosen judo master Kanae Hirata, Komuro is a ne waza (ground techniques) expert known for its use of "sutemi" (sacrifice throws) such as variations of tomoe nage, and submission techniques like jujigatame (armlock) and sode guruma jime (circular choke with the sleeves).
He is the author of a book dedicated to ground techniques, "".
Achievements.
Former member of the Japanese national team, Koji Komuro won several international judo competitions including the Veteran World Championship (in 2010 et 2017), the 2010 Kata World Championship with his uke Takano Kenji (in the "katame no kata" category), and was also awarded the bronze medal at the Kodokan Cup in 1999.
Advocating flexible thinking and believing that "one can adopt strategies from other martial arts and learn from many players," Koji Komuro also trained Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) and obtained in 2005 a black belt under Yuki Nakai who happened to be another former student of kosen judo master Kanae Hirata. Komuro does not define himself as a BJJ practitioner, and though he trained and competed in BJJ tournaments he considered it "extra judo ne waza training" where he "concentrated on quick transitions intro groundwork from standing and explosiveness instead of practising techniques which were banned in judo competitions rules such as leglocks." Komuro's achievements in BJJ tournaments include 2nd place (-68kg) at the 2005 Rickson Gracie's Budo Challenge, losing to Leonardo Vieira (Brazil) by points.
Submission grappling record.

Hamster Jovial

Hamster Jovial or Hamster Jovial et les louveteaux was a French comics series created by Marcel Gotlib about a scoutsleader and his three young cubs. It ran between December 1971 and June 1974 in the French music magazine "Rock &amp; Folk". Reprints also appeared in "Fluide Glacial".
Concept.
Hamster Jovial is a tall, naïve scouts leader who is passionate about pop music. He always tries to inspire his young scouts (two boy scouts, one girl) with moralistic life lessons and by teaching them to sing along songs with him, but none of them care. The comic strip was controversial for frequently making risqué jokes, particularly involving the sexual antics of the little girl scout and her boyfriend. Gotlib furthermore made a lot of references to rock artists who were popular around the time these comics were published, from Frank Zappa, Pink Floyd over The Who to Tina Turner. In one series of gags he had Hamster Jovial parody famous album covers.

Rufia gens

The gens Rufia, occasionally spelled Ruffia, was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are not mentioned in history until imperial times, and they achieved little prominence until the late third century, from which time the family rose in importance, gaining the consulship on a number of occasions from the time of Constantine the Great to that of Justinian, and frequently holding the post of .
Origin.
The nomen "Rufius" is derived from the common Latin surname , red, originally given to someone with red hair. It is frequently confounded with "Rufrius", presumably from the related , reddish or ruddy. Chase classifies "Rufius" among those gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else.
Branches and cognomina.
The Rufii used a variety of personal cognomina, which was typical of Roman nomenclature in imperial times. The only distinct family name seems to have been "Festus", joyous or festive, which appears among the Rufii for several centuries. The nomen "Ceionius" suggests that some of the Rufii were probably descended from the Ceionii, and acquired the nomen "Rufius" through a female line, although this is uncertain given the variability of Roman nomenclature under the Empire, in which nomina could be rearranged for political reasons, to emphasize family connections. "Avienus", which appears multiple times among the Rufii from the fourth to the sixth century, was probably acquired in this way; it was the nomen of an obscure plebeian family, while another of the family bore "Postumius", the nomen of one of Rome's great patrician houses; it occurs twice more among the Rufii a century later, once in the derivative form "Postumianus", although whether the latter were descended from the earlier Postumius is unknown. "Volusianus", derived from the ancient gens "Volusia", was also passed down for several generations.

The Happy Pals

The Happy Pals New Orleans Party Orchestra are a New Orleans traditional dance hall jazz band which was formed in 1968 by Clifford “Kid” Bastien, originally named Kid Bastien's Camellia Jazz band.
The Happy Pals are a classic New Orleans style ensemble which includes trumpet, trombone, clarinet, banjo, piano, double bass and drums. They are inspired by the early jazz and blues music of the 1920s and 1930s. The Happy Pals have been playing New Orleans dance hall jazz in Toronto for over four decades. They have also played throughout the United States and tour Europe annually.
History.
Clifford “Kid” Bastien was born in London England's East End in 1937. Bastien immigrated to Canada in 1962 after a brief stint in New Orleans. Bastien earned a reputation as a "guru of New Orleans jazz in Toronto". In 1968 Bastien founded the Kid Bastien's Camellia Jazz band, later to be renamed The Happy Pals. Bastien was now considered to be the foremost disciple of New Orleans trumpet legend Kid Thomas Valentine, whom Bastien had first witnessed playing at a neighborhood dance, at the Westwego Louisiana firehall. Bastien also gained a reputation for outlasting the revolving door of bar owners at Grossmans Tavern, and having personalities such as Woody Allen appear with him onstage.
On February 8, 2003 Bastien died of a heart attack in his Toronto apartment. After Bastien's passing, tenor saxophone player Patrick Tevlin switched to the trumpet in order to take on the leadership of the group.
Repertoire.
The singers and composers whose material they favor include Kid Thomas Valentine, King Oliver, Fats Domino, George Kewis, Johnny Cash, Glenn Miller, Hank Williams, Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan.
Musical Style.
Their music has been praised by music critics for its authenticity.
New Orleans jazz is alive and well and has taken root in, of all places, Toronto, Canada. The setting is live, the music is all New Orleans jazz swing, and the band seems to be having a heck of a party. Bourbon Street beckons for this kind of sound.

Scott attended TriCities High School of Performing Arts in Atlanta, Georgia, transferring to Tri-Cities High School in East Point, Georgia graduating in 1993.
1991–1992: Xscape beginnings.
While attending Tri-Cities performing arts high school in East Point, Georgia, Tamika met Kandi Burruss. The three (along with her sister LaTocha Scott began singing together and recruited a fourth member, Tamera Coggins, though her time with the group was short-lived. Soon Tameka "Tiny" Cottle was asked to audition for the girls, and Xscape was officially formed. After the group's major debut performance at BET's Teen Summit in 1992, the girls were introduced to record executive Ian Burke, who later became the group's manager. Xscape soon caught the attention of Jermaine Dupri, who later signed the group to his So So Def Recordings.
1993–1999: Xscape success.
The group released their debut album "Hummin' Comin' at 'Cha" on October 12, 1993. The album peaked at number seventeen on the U.S. Billboard 200 and number three on the Top R&amp;B Albums chart. It was a critical and commercial success, certified platinum within a year, and launched two hit singles, "Just Kickin' It" and "Understanding"; both entered the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and peaked at number one on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The follow-up singles, "Love on My Mind" and "Tonight", did not achieve the same success. The group later appeared on "The Mask" soundtrack and the soundtrack for the 1995 film "Panther", featuring the single "Freedom".
Xscape released their second studio album, "Off the Hook", in 1995. Much of the album's production was by Jermaine Dupri and featured guest vocals from MC Lyte. Four singles were released.

In early 1998, Xscape was featured on the Keith Sweat-produced single, "Am I Dreamin'", by R&amp;B newcomer group Ol' Skool.
1999: Xscape disbandment.
The dynamic of the group had changed by the third album, which led to LaTocha Scott leaving the group in 1999 to pursue a solo career. Subsequently, the group went on hiatus.
2000–2009: After Xscape.
In 2004, Scott, along with LaTocha Scott, Tameka "Tiny" Cottle, and new member Kiesha Miles, attempted to revamp Xscape. They released the single "What's Up" in 2005, but the reconciliation was short-lived and the group ultimately disbanded in 2005.

When Xscape reunited in 2017, they announced they would be releasing a biopic about the band. In the biopic, Scott plans to be played by her daughter. The band was followed by Bravo as they prepared for the 2017 Essence Festival. The footage was made into a four-part television series called "Xscape: Still Kickin' It". Tensions arose between band members during the show, and when asked about how the band was doing, Scott joked that they needed therapy.
In 2017, Scott had a "wardrobe malfunction" on stage when she tripped over her jumpsuit and fell. Scott revealed on "Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen" that when she got pregnant while in Xscape, her producers threatened to kick her out of the band if she didn't have an abortion.

A Moment in the Reeds

A Moment in the Reeds is a 2017 Finnish romantic drama film written and directed by Mikko Mäkelä in his feature directorial debut. It stars Janne Puustinen and Boodi Kabbani. The film had its world premiere at the 2017 BFI London Film Festival as part of the Love strand. Unusually for a Finnish film, most of the dialogue is in English as it is the only language shared by the two leading characters.
Plot.
Leevi returns to Finland from his university studies in Paris to spend the summer helping his father Jouko renovate the family lakehouse for sale. Leevi is estranged from his conservative father, his only living relative, and hopes to avoid mandatory military service by obtaining French citizenship. Tareq, an architect by profession who has come to Finland from war-torn Syria seeking asylum, has been hired to help with the work.
When Leevi's father returns to town on business, the two young men, speaking English, their only common language, establish a connection. They spend a few days discovering one another during an idyllic Finnish midsummer.
Production.
Mikko Mäkelä, a Finn from Lappeenranta, South Karelia, who has lived in England for ten years wrote the screenplay and directed the film. He explained the absence of a feature-length Finnish film addressing gay relationships saying "Non-commercial documentaries are alive and well in Finland, but full-length fiction cinema is always made with the returns in mind. Production companies don't take risks in countries this small." As a result, most of the film's budget came from private financing with a very small portion coming from crowd funding Indiegogo.
Filming took place in August 2016.
On his decision to choose gay actors for the lead roles, director Mäkelä wrote: "Casting gay actors for gay roles was the only option that made sense for me"."
The film had its world premiere in the Love strand of the BFI London Film Festival on 6 October 2017. It has since gone on to screen at festivals around the world including Goteborg International Film Festival, Seattle International Film Festival and Frameline in San Francisco.
Reception.
A reviewer in "Film Inquiry" called "A Moment in the Reeds" "the biggest surprise of the London Film Festival". He noted the plot's superficial resemblance to that of "God’s Own Country", which was in production at the same time, but found the Finnish film "far more subtle" and, like its British counterpart, "one of the most moving gay romance stories of recent years". In Sweden's "MovieZine", Alexander Dunerfors said the filmmakers turned their low budget to advantage by using just a few actors in an isolated setting and noted that "Most of the dialogue has been improvised by the actors themselves, giving a strong authentic touch–even in broken English." A German reviewer called it "a film pearl that shines with truthfulness and authenticity". He described the principal characters' relationship to Finland, one alienated and the other finding refuge: "Homeland is a strange world for both of them."
"Variety" magazine's Dennis Harvey wrote favourably of the film. "There's an admirable quiet intensity to "A Moment in the Reeds", a first feature by London-based Mikko Mäkelä set in his native Finland. Superficially similar to "God's Own Country", this bittersweet tale of attraction between a prodigal son and a refugee worker is both a more straightforward romance for much of its runtime and a sadder one in the end."

François Morelli

François Morelli (28 February 1833 – 29 May 1892) was a French shipowner and politician.
For a while he ran a shipping service in the western Mediterranean based in Marseille, but it suffered from severe competition and several business mishaps.
After he was elected senator his business declined further, and then was declared bankrupt.
He died in office shortly after its assets were sold at auction.
Early years.
François Morelli was born on 28 February 1833 in Bocognano, Corsica.
He came from a Bocognano family that had caused Napoleon some trouble in 1793.
His parents both worked on the land.
He gained a secondary education, then was employed by various businesses in Corsica.
In 1869 Morelli became special railway commissioner in Nice.
After the fall of the Second French Empire Morelli became director of food and restaurants for the Compagnie de navigation des paquebots de la Méditerranée (Mediterranean Packet Boat Navigation Company), owned by Count Jean Joseph Valéry,
He became one of the main partners of Count Valéry, whose shipping company had 25 ships in the western Mediterranean based in Marseille.
The ships sailed from there to Corsica, Spain, Italy and Algeria.
Valéry was also the Bonapartist general councillor for the canton of Brando from 1871 to 1879.
After he was elected a senator in 1876 his company was poorly managed.
Valery died on 26 March 1879 at the age of 53.
When Count Valéry died in 1879 Morelli became president of the shipping company.
The Valéry family abandoned their business in March 1883 and sold the remaining 11 ships of their fleet to a company organized by Morelli with other Corsican capitalists to fight the Compagnie Fraissinet hegemony on Corsica.
The company was named Compagnie insulaire de navigation à vapeur Morelli (Morelli Island Steam Navigation Company).
It was founded on 9 March 1883 and served the ports of Marseille, Nice, Bastia, Ajaccio, Livorno, Calvi, L'Île-Rousse, Propriano and Bonifacio.
It obtained the concession for postal service between Marseile and Corsica, Sardinia and Livorno.
Morelli ordered two more ships, "Bocognano", delivered in 1884, and "Ville de Bastia".
He was made a knight of the Legion of Honour.
In 1885 the government of Haiti requested four ships for postal service, which Morelli dispatched.
However, due to misunderstanding caused by the very slow communications between Paris and Port-au-Prince, the Haitians made a deal with another company before Morelli's ships arrived.
The ships spent several months at anchor in Haiti before returning to Le Havre.
Morelli took a considerable loss and had to borrow to pay his crews, who were mostly Corsicans.
His ships, which had cost about 1,000,000 francs, were seized and sold at auction for 80,000 francs.
The company suffered from two shipwrecks that made it impossible to conduct the postal service between the continent and Corsica.
The Compagnie Fraissinet started a service that took 15 hours to reach Bastia from Marseille, and took over the postal concession.
Politics.
As Morelli rose in shipping society and in Bonapartist circles he began to become involved in the politics of the French Third Republic.
In 1874 he was elected Bonapartist general councillor for the canton of Bocognano, holding office until 1881.
During his election campaign a bonfire was lit beside his home in Marseille and drinks and food were offered to his supporters according to the island tradition.
After Valéry's death in 1879 Morelli moved to the republicans and became a follower of Emmanuel Arène.
He used his company to reward republican voters, either with free passage during elections or with jobs.
In 1884 the company gave several thousand francs to Emmanuel Arène and Nicolas Péraldi for campaign expenses.
In 1886 Morelli's company was accused by Sampiero Porri (1857–1926) in the journal "Le Pilori" of giving Arène and Peraldi regular monthly cash payments in return for allocation of the postal concession.
Morelli ran for election to the senate in 1888, but was defeated.
In 1889 Arène helped ensure that Morelli was elected senator of Corsica.
He was nominated Moderate Republican candidate in by-election that followed the death of Patrice de Corsi.
He was elected senator of Corsica on 13 January 1889.
He won 363 votes to 356 for François Pitti-Ferrandi.
He sat with the center-left, voted for the draft Lisbonne law restricting the freedom of the press, and abstained from the vote on the process against General Boulanger.
In 1890 he accompanied Marie François Sadi Carnot, President of France, on his official visit to Corsica.
He voted for the law on workplace accidents, for election of deputies in a single-name ballot, for laws penalizing the press for insult and defamation of the President of France, ministers, deputies, senators and public office holders, and for the principle of a tax quota for buildings.
He was a member of the Committee for Petitions.
He did not speak in public.
Business failure and death.
Morelli suffered from poor health, and this coupled with concerns about his Compagnie insulaire de navigation à vapeur kept him away from the senate, particularly from 1891.
His company was in poor financial condition and Morelli did not manage it well while engaged in the senate.
The Compagnie insulaire de navigation à vapeur, F. Morelli et Cie was declared bankrupt by two judgements pronounced by the Marseilles commercial court on 17 April 1891 and 5 May 1891, confirmed by the Aix-en-Provence court of appeal on 5 August 1891.
On 16 May 1892 "Le Phare de la Corse" reported that five steamers of the former Morelli company had been auctioned at the Marseille stock exchange for one million francs.
The Fraissinet company acquired the steamers "Bocognano", "Ville de Bastia", "Comte Bacciochi", "Persévérant" and "Evénement".
The collapse of his company caused the loss of the savings of several small capitalists who had lent money to Morelli.
He died on 29 May 1892 at his country estate in Aygalades, near Marseille, at the age of 59.

Golden Guinea Breweries

Golden Guinea Breweries Plc is a Nigerian brewery located in Umuahia, Abia State. It was founded in 1962 by the Eastern Nigerian regional government as an indigenous competitor to foreign manufacturers in the country. The company produces Golden Guinea beer.
Golden Guinea was originally named Independence Brewery Limited, the location was chosen due to the importance of water which led to the selection of a site in Umuahia, the town of the regional premier, Michael Okpara. Production started in 1963 with an annual capacity of 1 million gallons. The company introduced Eagle Stout to the market in 1967 but between 1967 and 1970 further production was hampered by the Nigerian Civil War. In 1971, the company changed its name to the current one, Golden Guinea Breweries. In 1975, the company was revamped and an extension was built by the German firm Coutinho Caro which later participated in an equity offering issued by the firm.
Production at the brewery was hampered by a fire incident in 2003 but recent attempts have been made to resuscitate the firm. The company held franchise rights to produce and market Holsten Brewery's Bergedorf premium lager beer and Bergedorf Malta in Nigeria.

Battle of Simbirsk

Battle of Simbirsk in 1670 was a decisive battle of Stepan Razin's rebellion.
Prelude.
During the summer of 1670, Razin captured Tsaritsyn and Astrakhan. From there, Cossacks on 200 boats sailed up the Volga, taking Saratov and Samara, massacring nobles and plundering their property. On September 4, some 5.000 Cossacks besieged Simbirsk, a small wooden fort, defended by a small force of professional soldiers ("Regiments of the New Order").
Battle.
Although the rebels were unable to capture the fort, their ranks swelled to 20.000, including local serfs. While Razin was pinned down at Simbirsk, on September 15, government troops started from Kazan to break the siege, dispersing several rebel detachments on the way. On October 11, both armies met near Simbirsk.
While inferior in numbers, government troops were superior in discipline, armament, and tactics, resulting from the military reforms of Tsar Alexis according to Western European standards.
Disciplined units of Reiters and Dragoons attacked first, firing on rebels at point-blank range, then rapidly retreated, luring rebels into firing ranks of infantry and artillery. Razin himself was wounded twice and fled with some Don Cossacks, while most of the rebels scattered, and subsequently died on the run.
Aftermath.
Defeat was decisive for rebellion of Stepan Razin: soon he was betrayed by Don Cossacks and executed on June 16, 1671 in Moscow.

Ellen Nielsen

Ellen Nielsen (' or more commonly ', 17 July 1871-25 July 1960) was a Danish-born teacher and missionary who moved to Manchuria, took Chinese citizenship and worked to establish schools and provide social services in the Qianshan District. She founded the first kindergarten, a girl's elementary school, as well as a middle school, high school and normal school. Providing employment, she established a manufacturing center where women produced textile goods and men learned agricultural skills. Paying workers from her own salary, she created a collective village, where the Gushan Apricot was first cultivated by Nielsen. During the Communist Revolution she was arrested and her belongings and the communal lands were confiscated. When they were redistributed she was assisted by villagers to meet the production requirements. Her helpers were arrested and after her death were tried as counter-revolutionaries. She was rehabilitated in 1980 and is now recognized in China for her contributions to the Liaoning Province.
Early life.
Ellen Kirstine Marie Nielsen was born on 17 July 1871 in Bregninge, a village in the Holbæk Municipality of the Region Sjælland, Denmark to Maren Kirstine (née Jensen) and Jørgen Nielsen. Her father was a chimney sweep, who often failed to provide for his family because of his drinking problem. Her mother raised the six children and worked on the farm raising cattle, horses and sheep. Nielsen, the youngest child, often helped her mother and developed a love of the outdoors at an early age. Because of the family's poverty, from the age eight, she worked to earn money to go to school. When her mother died in 1890, she moved to Copenhagen and began working with prostitutes for the Young Women's Christian Association (. Wanting to work as a missionary, Nielsen was referred to the Danish Missionary Society (DMS) by the YWCA board. The DMS had never sent women to the mission field and initially refused to send Nielsen, requiring her to complete her education. With another woman, Kathrine Nielsen, she enrolled in the teacher's preparatory program of the N. Zahle's School. The training also included nursing courses and instruction in Chinese. Upon their graduation in 1897, both women were referred a second time by the YWCA to the DMS board, which agreed to send them to Manchuria as the first missionary women from Denmark.
Career.
In 1898, Nielsen arrived in China and was assigned to work at the Missionary Church in Dandong, Liaoning Province providing nursing care at the West Street Clinic. Because of an epidemic at that time, she was sent to Dagushan (), a town lying to the southwest of Dandong, where she saw up to 100 patients per day. There were conflicts with the local residents over the missionaries' refusal to accept Chinese medicine and their religious beliefs. In 1902, Nielsen established an industrial boarding school and began teaching the following year, with three students. She established an admittance policy which rejected any student with bound feet. The school taught girls embroidery skills and then sold the handicrafts produced abroad to fund the institution, as well as providing them with classes in reading, hygiene and religion. Two of her first three students were orphans, whom she had adopted.
Nielsen founded the Chongzheng Girls' Primary School () in 1908 and four years later she opened a center for homeless women. The Chongzheng Poverty Relief Center () trained women in textile and embroidery manufacture. It expanded to include unemployed fathers, teaching them farming skills. Recognizing that many of the women had children, which impacted their ability to work, in 1913 she established the first kindergartens in Manchuria. In the spring of 1920, she built 8 homes on the north side of Gushan Mountain, in the Qianshan Mountain Range, to provide for the care of elderly and disabled villagers. Over the next several years, acting as principal of the school, she expanded the curricula to include a middle school, high school and normal school. Deciding that she would live permanently in China, Nielsen gave up her Danish citizenship and applied for Chinese citizenship in 1929, becoming nationalized in 1931 and adopting the Chinese characters "聂乐信" for her name.
Along with her citizenship, Nielsen was allowed to purchase land, and she used funds received from Denmark to create a collective known as Nielsen's Family Village. By 1939, the collective housed more than 300 people; there were 417 students and 18 teachers working in the girl's school from all over Manchuria and North Korea; the poverty center had 370 people enrolled in assistance programs, and there were 175 houses built as part of the collective. Using her salary, she paid each worker seven dollars a month in addition to sharing with them the crop yields and livestock, as well as providing free schooling for their children. She also purchased property on Ludao Island to give the workers a place where they could take holidays.
In 1942, during the Japanese invasion of Manchuria they overtook the school changing the name to Dagushan National University of Higher Education. At the end of the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Communist Revolution began and several missionaries left the area in 1946. In 1947, the Communists arrived in Dagushan and seized Nielsen's personal belongings, as well as the land and properties. She was placed under house arrest and at her trial was convicted of being a landlord. Her two Danish employees, Nanny Brostrøm and Astrid Poulsen were jailed, and her Chinese employees were sent to work camps, leaving the elderly tenants to fend for themselves. After fourteen days, the Danish women were released and returned to Denmark. Most of the Chinese employees died in the camps. Nielsen refused to leave, because she was a Chinese citizen and had a responsibility to care for the villagers. When the communist administrators took over the village, they seized the church school, closed the factory and poor relief agency, and allocated the land and houses to other workers.
In 1949, the new regime promised religious freedom and the church building, four cows, an orchard and a pond were returned to Nielsen. She tried to reorganize the community and revive the church, but her hopes were short-lived when another wave of denunciations was prompted by the government and she was branded as an imperialist. By 1950, Nielsen was the only Danish missionary remaining in China and was forced to live in a small basement room. A faithful helper, Wang Chengren, assisted her in selling milk to meet her production quotas. Neighbors assisted her as she aged and lost her sight, Wang was arrested in 1959 and charged with assisting Nielsen, and then in February 1960, she fell, breaking her arms.
Death and legacy.
Nielsen died on 25 July 1960 at her home in Dagushan. Church members buried her at the foot of Gushan Mountain. Five days after her death, Wang was convicted of being a counter-revolutionary and was sentenced to 15 years in prison. In 1980, she, along with other missionaries, were rehabilitated and a decade later, she was recognized by the authorities in Dagushan for her contributions to the area. The Gushan Apricot, which is now a regional delicacy, was grafted from the yellow apricots Nielsen imported from Denmark and grew at the collective.

San Siro Stables

San Siro Stables, also known as Scuderie De Montel, were built in Milan between 1914 and 1924 by De Montel, a Jewish Milanese aristocrat. In 1938, following the application of racial laws in Italy, the government took possession of the buildings.
Recent developments.
In 2006 Consorzio Stabile SPA, a conglomerate made of local building companies won the public tender issued by the City Council of Milan to rebuild the baths of Milan on the grounds of the former San Siro stables. The project was later abandoned by the same city government that launched it.

Péter Juhász (politician)

Péter Juhász (born 27 February 1971) is a Hungarian telemarketer, cannabis activist and politician, who served as leader of the Együtt party from February 2017 until its dissolution.
Business affairs.
Since 1996, he worked for Budapest Bank as an employer and then head of department. Juhász earned a degree of communications and PR at the Kodolányi János University of Applied Sciences (KJF) in 2000. He was involved in various telemarketing, trade and catering companies since 2001. His firm "Juhász és Villányi Ltd." went bankrupt in 2003, as well as his other companies "Peter, Peter &amp; Partners Ltd." and "Ó 17 Ltd." in 2006 and 2008, respectively. He was labelled that he owned various phantom companies to avoid the successful implementation of the tax regulations. Altogether, he owned 11 companies since 2001, six of them went bankrupt and were phantomized.
Activism.
Juhász founded the Hemp Seed Association ("Kendermag Egyesület") in 2002, which advocated for the legalization of "soft drugs" and the decriminalization of all kinds of drugs. In this capacity, Juhász and other activists organized a so-called "Civil Obedience Movement" in March 2005, under which dozens of cannabis users reported themselves to the police, including Juhász. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) provided legal assistance and representation for all activists involved in the movement. During the trial, Juhász declared that he grew and used cannabis solely to supply his own personal needs, and also presented a five-foot ripe cannabis plant before the court. In January 2006, he was sentenced to a fine of 70,000 HUF at first instance. The court of second instance confirmed the verdict against Juhász in December 2006; the court declared that Juhász "is extremely dangerous to the society, because he wanted to use criminal prosecution, the instrument of law and the court to proclaim the legalization of drug consumption". TASZ refused the argument and claimed "the courts are also places of freedom of expression".
He acted as spokesperson of the Hemp Seed Association until 2009, following that he was elected its president, replacing László Felső. Juhász vocally supported the ban of the Magyar Gárda in December 2007. He was an organizer of the Tarka Magyar! protest against ethnic and racial exclusion in October 2008. He was an anchorman at the Tilos Rádió from 2008 to 2012, and was a curator of its foundation. Simultaneously, he was also involved in the Romani program of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union between 2009 and 2012.
Political career.
Juhász organized a protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's newly accepted Media Act on 20 December 2010. Thereafter he created a Facebook page named One Million for Press Freedom ("Egymillióan a magyar sajtószabadságért"), mostly known by its shorter name "Milla". The movement participated in numerous protests in the following period and, by 2012, the Facebook page reached 100,000 likes. Juhász and some of his followers founded an association behind the Milla on 10 October 2012, and Juhász was elected its president. Former prime minister Gordon Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the Milla. Bajnai, Juhász and Péter Kónya (Hungarian Solidarity Movement) founded Together 2014 as a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations to contrast the Orbán cabinet.
According to plans, Together 2014 would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties, similar to the Olive Tree in Italy which established against Silvio Berlusconi's right-wing coalition in 1995. However Politics Can Be Different (LMP) had rejected the cooperation in November 2012 and January 2013, and the Hungarian Socialist Party led by Attila Mesterházy gradually took over the initiative. The Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, as only parties could take part in the election according to the rules. Three co-presidents were elected: Viktor Szigetvári (Patriotism and Progress Association), Péter Kónya (Solidarity) and Péter Juhász (Milla). The party was registered as "Together – Party for a New Era" because several other organizations overtaken the name "Together 2014" at the National Election Office. After Together entered into an electoral coalition with left-wing parties, including former PM Ferenc Gyurcsány's Democratic Coalition, Juhász offered his resignation and stepped down from his party's national list in the 2014 parliamentary election.
Péter Juhász ran as candidate of the position of mayor of Belváros-Lipótváros (5th District of Budapest) during the 2014 local elections, but received 30.26 percent of the vote and was defeated by Péter Szentgyörgyvölgyi (Fidesz). Nevertheless, he became a member of the local representative body. During his activity, he made public several corruption suspicious real estate transactions from the tenure of the previous Fidesz mayor Antal Rogán.
On 4 February 2017, Péter Juhász was elected as the party's new leader. He resigned as a member of the representative body in the 5th district in April.
Since March, Juhász urged the election cooperation of those "democratic opposition parties", which refuse both the Orbán regime and the former governing left-wing parties, who represent the "world before 2010". Juhász called his concept as "New Pole" ("Új Pólus"), with the possible participation of the Politics Can Be Different (LMP), the Dialogue for Hungary (PM), the Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party (MKKP) and the Momentum Movement, in addition to his party. With that statement, Juhász refused the cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the Democratic Coalition (DK) and the Hungarian Liberal Party (MLP) for 2018 parliamentary election. According to a Medián opinion poll published in July 2017, this hypothetical alliance would receive 16 percent of the vote in the next election. While the Together and the PM renewed their alliance in accordance with Juhász's "New Pole" concept on 4 October 2017, both LMP and Momentum Movement had rejected the election cooperation with other parties. On 23 June 2017, MP Zsuzsanna Szelényi announced that she resigned from her position in the party leadership and quit Together, after losing the election for the party leadership in February against Péter Juhász. She also disagreed with the new direction and method of politics, installed by Juhász and criticized the new president's guerrilla campaign methods and media PR campaigns and "ostentatious performances". She also said that she would retain her parliamentary mandate.
In January 2018, leaders of the party announced that Together will participate in the 2018 national election separately. Former party president Viktor Szigetvári was nominated their candidate for the position of prime minister. Juhász intended to run as a candidate in the 5th district of Budapest, but, following a domestic violence scandal, when it was revealed that he assaulted his former life partner physically, withdrew his nomination in order to support a single opposition candidate against Fidesz politician István Hollik. The Together party failed to reach 5% electoral threshold, receiving 0.66 percent of the vote. According to the laws, Together had to repay the state aid of HUF 150 million to the state budget, as a result Juhász organized a fundraising campaign. The Together ceased to exist on 2 June 2018.

Vide Noir

Vide Noir is the third studio album by American rock band Lord Huron. It was released on April 20, 2018, by Republic Records, their first for a major record label. The title "Vide Noir" is French for "Black Void".
Background.
After recording their second album, "Strange Trails", in 2014, and releasing it in early 2015, the band toured heavily in support of its release during the following few years. This exposure eventually led to the band’s song, "The Night We Met,” being featured in the Netflix show "13 Reasons Why". The feature led to the song breaking into the "Billboard" US all-format Hot 100 chart at number 84. The song's mainstream breakthrough caught the attention of Republic Records. After signing, the band began to work on their third studio album.
Writing and recording.
The album was their first to be recorded on a major record label. The album was mixed by veteran music producer Dave Fridmann, who the band chose to work with due to his previous work with Tame Impala, The Flaming Lips, and Baroness.
Themes and composition.
The album's title, "Vide Noir", is French for "Black Void". Frontman and lyricist Ben Schneider stated that he drew influence for writing the album from wandering around Los Angeles at night. He explained:
Schneider noted a slight change in sound for the band in the album; noting that it was more of a "very bass- and drums-heavy record" and that "There’s plenty of acoustic guitar still on there, but usually, it’s distorted and blown to shit." Spin Magazine and NPR noted that the song "Ancient Names (Part 1)" possessed the band's usual indie folk rock sound, while "Ancient Names (Part 2)" was described as moving into a more garage rock sounding sound. Conversely, "Wait by the River" was described as having a waltz-like sound with the vocals of an obsessive narrator.
Release and promotion.
On January 26, 2018, the band announced the album's name - "Vide Noir " and its release date, as April 20, 2018. The same date, the band also premiered the first two songs from the album, "Ancient Names (Part 1)" and "Ancient Names (Part 2)". A third song, "Wait by the River", was released ahead of the album on February 16, 2018, and another released on March 30, 2018 titled "When the Night is Over." "Ancient Names (Part 1)" would peak at number 45 on the "Billboard" Hot Rock Songs chart, while "Wait by the River" would peak at number 17 on the same chart, number 22 on the "Billboard" Adult Alternative Songs chart.
On March 30, 2018, seven songs from the album were made available to stream at specific geo-locations across the United States, Canada, the UK, and Australia. Using followtheemeraldstar.com and a mobile device with GPS, such as a smartphone, the user was guided to the hand-selected locations, including national parks, hikes, beaches, and even a volcano, where they could then listen to one song.
The band also launched a "Vide Noir" public access television show in select American cities. This was designed to be an immersive program that "expands upon the album's narratives and themes while showcasing the hidden world that inhabits "Vide Noir"". This program was also streamed on Twitch for worldwide viewing on April 19, 2018.
The band began its tour to support the album, starting the day of release, April 20, in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and moved throughout North America until ending in Denver, Colorado in October 2018.
Reception.
"Under the Radar" magazine praised the album, describing it as "easily the band's most musically striking release to date" and stating that it "hold[s] the same grounded grooves fans and critics have come to appreciate from their first two albums...but layered atop and around Ben Schneider's rooted compositions are psychedelic frills, fuzzed out guitars, and foreign instrumentation.

Waterloo Halt railway station was a small halt which served the community of Rudry in Caerphilly, South Wales between 1908 and 1956.
Like other halts on the line, Waterloo was very basic, consisting of a single ground-level platform made from sleepers, a name-board and one lamp (though the halt did have a second lamp for at least some of its later life). There was no shelter, with passengers being confined to a fenced enclosure, whose gate to the platform would be unlocked by the guard when the train arrived.
Located on the original Brecon &amp; Merthyr Loop Line (as opposed to the second line which was built later by the Pontypridd, Newport &amp; Caerphilly Railway), Waterloo Halt was served by 'down' services only. Fountain Bridge Halt on the opposite side of the river (on the PN&amp;CR line) was served by the 'up' trains.
The halt closed in 1956 when the passenger service was withdrawn. The site is now the garden of a private residence.

Peter Dunsby

Peter Dunsby (born 12 November 1966) is a full professor of gravitation and cosmology at the Department of Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. He was the co-director of the Astrophysics, Cosmology and Gravity Centre at the university until 2016. He also serves on the editorial board of the "International Journal of Modern Physics".
Dunsby has published extensively in the fields of cosmology and gravitation, including higher-order theories of gravity and f(R) gravity, and was the founding Director of the South African National Astrophysics and Space Science Programme (NASSP).
In 2006, Dunsby was awarded the silver medal by the Southern African Association for the Advancement of Science for his contributions to theoretical cosmology. The committee called out his research on cosmic microwave background radiation and study of study of Type Ia supernova which increased accuracy of calculation of the Hubble parameter. In 2016 he was presented the award for Human Capacity Development by the National Science and Technology Forum for his work developing postgraduate students and post doctoral researchers. 
In October 2017 Dunsby was elected to the College of Fellows of the University of Cape Town. 
Dunsby briefly received international attention following a 20 March 2018 report of a "very bright optical transient near the Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae" to the "Astronomers Telegram", an internet service for quickly disseminating information about astronomical events. Forty minutes later he posted again, saying that the object in question was "identified as Mars". Dunsby later described the incident to "Newsweek" as "an honest mistake arising from simply not checking what else was in my camera frame, during an automated astrophotography session and of very little consequence in the scheme of things, but agreed it was rather funny. The world needs to smile more, so that’s something good that has come out of this episode.” "The Astronomer's Telegram" editors presented Dunsby with a tongue-in-cheek award as discoverer of Mars.

Voice acting career.
Drama Studio London voice coaches highlighted Edmunds' vocal physiology, describing it as “"very unusual - a deep resonant chest-voice combined with a light resonant head-voice"" - giving him a unique sound. Upon graduating he began working as a voice actor and voiceover artist alongside his acting career.
Acting career.
Edmunds has worked in film, television, theatre, commercials and standup comedy - most notably in the main cast role of Peter, the hapless deputy manager, in the British comedy series "Hotel Getaway" (ITV).

Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos, Skopje

The Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos or Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary () is an Orthodox church in Skopje, North Macedonia. 
According to the legends, there was a medieval church. During the early 19th century the locals in Skopje decided to build there a new church. The project had become possible because the Ottoman building law, which had once limited the construction or renovation of Christian churches, had been changed. The construction works began in 1809 under the direction of the builder and painter Damjan Jankulov. He died during the construction period and the church was completed by his sons, led by Andreja Damjanov. On May 1, 1835, it was consecrated to the birth of the Blessed Virgin. The church is a three-aisled stone basilica with a western extension. The iconostasis is decorated with marble and wood carvings.
One year after the completion of the church, a convent school teaching in Bulgarian was built in its courtyard. Around 1850, the school was converted according to the Lancasterian system and 1895 it was transformed into Bulgarian Pedagogical School of Skopje. According to a Firman issued by the Sultan Abdülaziz on February 28, 1870, after a plebiscite of the Slavic population of Skopje, the first bishop of the Bulgarian Orthodox Diocese of Skopje was appointed in 1874. The Diocese eventually became part of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church. The Church of Our Lady became its local seat. After the incorporation of Skopje in 1912 in Serbia, the church was subordinated to the Serbian Orthodox Church. During Bulgarian occupation of the area in the First and in the Second World War the church was subordinated again to the BOC.
The church was affected by a fire during an Allied bombing raid on April 6, 1944. According to other report, the incident was triggered by accident by the cook of a German military unit stationed in the service premises of the church. Part of the church plate was brought out of the burning building and was subsequently taken over by the Bulgarian church authorities. During the bombing, a number of properties of the BOC's Skopje diocese were seriously damaged. According to the controversial Macedonian historiographycal data the church was burned up deliberately by the Bulgarian "fascistic occupiers".
In 1950s it was subordinated to the Macedonian Orthodox Church. It remained a bishop's church until its destruction during the Skopje earthquake of 1963. From 2005 to 2008 it was completely reconstructed.
In 2018, a report and a photograph of preserved slab appeared in Macedonian media. On the slab was an inscription: "The Main Door of the Bulgarian People's Church of the Nativity of the Holy Virgin, July 20, 1879." The report has revealed that the slab was mounted on the church itself, but later was removed and kept for years in a secret place, as not to be destroyed by the Yugoslav authorities.

John A. Kenney Jr.

John Andrew Kenney Jr. (October 8, 1914 – November 29, 2003) was an American dermatologist who taught at Howard University. He specialized in the study of skin disorders affecting racial minorities. He was one of the first African-American doctors to receive formal training in dermatology, and his mentees often described him as the "dean of black dermatology".
Early life and education.
Kenney was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, on October 8, 1914. He was the oldest of four children of John A. Kenney Sr. and Frieda Armstrong Kenney, both of whom were also influential figures in African-American medicine. His father joined the Tuskegee Institute on the invitation of its founder, Booker T. Washington; he later became medical director and chief surgeon there. His mother graduated from Boston University, making her one of the first black women to do so; she later also took a teaching position at the Tuskegee Institute. After the family was threatened by the Ku Klux Klan, they moved to Montclair, New Jersey in 1923, where Kenney attended Montclair High School. He graduated from Bates College in 1942, where he studied chemistry and biology, and received his medical degree from Howard University in 1945. At Howard, he was a member of both Alpha Omega Alpha and Kappa Pi.
Career.
Kenney was an instructor in biochemistry at Howard from 1946 to 1948, and served as the assistant editor of the "Journal of the National Medical Association" from 1947 to 1952. In 1953, he opened a private dermatology and syphilology practice in Cleveland, Ohio. He joined the faculty of Howard University as an assistant professor in 1961, and continued to teach there for almost four decades. He served as president of the National Medical Association from 1962 to 1963, making him the only president of this association whose father had also previously been its president. By 1973, he had succeeded in creating a separate dermatology department at Howard's Freedmen's Hospital. He served as chief of the division of dermatology there for 12 years, after which he served as founding chairman of the department of dermatology for five years. He stepped down from his position of department chairman in 1980. He remained a practicing dermatologist in Washington, D.C. until 1999.
Honors and awards.
In 1970, Kenney became the first black member of the American Academy of Dermatology, which named him a Master of Dermatology in 1995. In 1988, he received the Dermatology Foundation's Finnerwood Award, and he received the American Academy of Dermatology's Gold Medal in 2001.
Personal life and death.
Kenney married Larcenia Ferne Wood in 1943; they remained married until her death in 2000. They had three children together: Frances Wood Kenney Moseley, John Andrew Kenney III, and Anne Kenney. Kenney Jr. died of heart failure on November 29, 2003, at his home in Washington, D.C.
Influence.
Kenney's obituary in "The Washington Post" estimated that of the about 300 black dermatologists practicing in the United States in 2003, Kenney had mentored or trained about one-third of them.

List of games by Epic Games

Epic Games is an American video game and software developer based in Cary, North Carolina. It was founded by Tim Sweeney as Potomac Computer Systems in 1991, originally located in his parents' house in Potomac, Maryland. After releasing one game under that name, "ZZT" (1991), Sweeney renamed the company to Epic MegaGames in early 1992 "to make it look like we were a big company" even though it had no other employees or offices. Over the next few years, the company continued to make PC games, largely self-published, including the side-scrollers "Jill of the Jungle" (1992) and "Jazz Jackrabbit" (1994). They additionally published titles by other developers such as "Epic Pinball" (1993) by Digital Extremes and "Tyrian" (1995) by Eclipse Software. Epic also slowly expanded in size, reaching 8 employees by 1994.
Beginning with the 1996 game "Fire Fight", Epic ceased its publishing and self-publishing operations, and after the release and success of "Unreal" (1998) renamed itself in 1999 to Epic Games and moved to Raleigh, North Carolina; it and a temporary office in Canada during "Unreal"s development were the first time the company had a central office for their employees. After the name change, the company focused almost solely on the "Unreal" series of shooters for the next few years, and expanded from PC games to console games. In 2006 the company launched its "Gears of War" series of games, and in 2010 the company moved into mobile games with the "Infinity Blade" series after purchasing Chair Entertainment. Epic returned to retail publishing in 2015 for its own titles, and has solely self-published since. In addition to games, Epic develops and licenses the Unreal Engine, which is also used as the game engine for many of its own games.
Sweeney describes the history of the company in four eras: The shareware era from founding through 1997 as the company grew to 15 employees; the "Unreal" era from 1998 to 2005 as the company focused on developing that franchise through external publishers and grew to 25 employees; the "Gears of War" era from 2006 to 2011 as the company shifted focus to console games and grew to around 200 employees; and the current era where the company has moved back to PC games and self-publishing, spinning off or closing some of its subsidiary developers such as People Can Fly and Big Huge Games. Epic Games has worked on over 60 games since 1991, and has multiple games under development.
Video games.
Epic Games has used the names Potomac Computer Systems, Epic MegaGames, and Epic Games; the name given for the company is the one used at the time of a game's release. Many of the games under the Epic MegaGames brand were released as a set of separate episodes, which were purchasable and playable separately or as a group. In many cases the initial episode of a game was freely distributed as shareware to drive interest in the other purchasable episodes. Titles are listed for games that gave individual names to their episodes instead of episode numbers.

Frank Avruch

Frank Bernard Avruch (May 21, 1928 – March 20, 2018) was an American television host who played Bozo the Clown on Boston television from 1959 to 1970. He played the first nationally syndicated version of the clown.
Early life.
Avruch was born in Boston and grew up in Winthrop, Massachusetts. He was named best actor at Winthrop High School and acted in Summer stock theatre in Gloucester, Massachusetts. However, his mother objected to an acting career and he enrolled in Missouri School of Journalism. He later returned to Boston and in 1949 he graduated from the Boston University College of Communication with a bachelor’s degree in journalism.
His first broadcasting job came at WVOM. He then worked at WNEB in Worcester, Massachusetts before returning to Boston. In 1957 he married Betty F. Greenman. In 1959 they purchased a home in Newton Centre, Massachusetts. They had two sons.
Bozo the Clown.
Avruch joined WHDH-TV in 1957 as an announcer. In 1959, WHDH purchased the rights to Bozo the Clown from Larry Harmon and Avruch won the role. In 1966, Harmon decided to replace all of the local versions of Bozo with a single nationally syndicated show and chose Avruch to serve as Bozo. Avruch taped 180 episodes of "Bozo’s Big Top" for national syndication. As Bozo, Avruch toured the world performing for UNICEF. He was given a United Nations Award for his work with children. During his time as Bozo, Avruch also interviewed entertainment figures for "Dateline: Boston". In 1970, WHDH-TV cancelled Bozo in favor of a morning news broadcast.
"Great Entertainment" and "Man About Town".
Following Bozo’s cancellation, Avruch chose to remain in Boston rather than playing Bozo in another city. When WCVB-TV went on the air in 1972, he became the station’s booth announcer, performing on-air commercials and promos. In 1973 he began hosting "Great Entertainment", WCVB-TV’s weekend film series. During its peak the series aired at 11:30 pm on Saturday and Sunday nights and during the afternoons on Sundays. Its popularity inspired WSBK-TV and WQTV to create similar programs – WSBK’s "The Movie Loft" hosted by Dana Hersey and WQTV’s "Those Magnificent Talkies" hosted by Earl Ziff. In 1974, Avruch began co-hosting WCVB-TV’s Sunday public affairs program, known by various names during its run, including, "Sunday Open House", "New England Sunday", "Sunday Best", and "Sunday". He also hosted a weekly cultural news report called "Man About Town". In 1986, Avruch suffered a mild heart attack. He returned to the air after only 17 days. In 1992, WCVB-TV cut "Sunday" from a weekly program to a monthly one. That December, finding it difficult to compete with cable networks, especially after Turner Broadcasting acquired the MGM library that WCVB-TV had long been using, the station canceled "Great Entertainment". Avruch remained with the station as its announcer and an on-air personality for special events and occasional news stories. He retired from the station in 1995, but continued to appear on the stations’ various telethons and represented the station at various public events.
Later life and death.
Following his retirement, Avruch launched his own website – Frank Avruch: Boston's Man About Town (www.bostonman.com), which, like the “Man About Town” segments he did for WCVB-TV news, provided information on special events, hotels, restaurants, museums, and theaters in Boston. He also hosted a classic movie series at the Wang Center for the Performing Arts and the Coolidge Corner Theatre, did voice over work, and represented WCVB-TV at public functions. In 2007 he was inducted into the inaugural class of the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame. The Avruchs spent their later years in Boston. Avruch died on March 20, 2018 in his Boston home of heart disease. He was 89 years old.

Grammothele bambusicola is a poroid crust fungus in the family Polyporaceae that is found in Asia. It was described as new to science in 1984 by Norwegian mycologist Leif Ryvarden.
Description.
Fruit bodies of the fungus are crust-like, measuring up to 1 mm thick, with a pore surface colour ranging from cream to straw to pale yellowish brown. The shallow pores number 2–3 per millimetre.
"G. bambusicola" has a dimitic hyphal system; its generative hyphae have clamp connections. Spores are more or less ellipsoid in shape, thin-walled, and measure 7–8.5 by 4–5 μm. The fungus is similar in morphology to "Grammothele ochracea" (found in Thailand), but differs from that species in having larger pores, more yellowish colour, and spores that are longer and more ellipsoid.
Habitat and distribution.
The type collection was made an altitude of in Ghorepani, in the Gandaki Zone of Nepal, in October 1979. It was found growing on "Bambusa". The species was later reported from Takatsuki, Osaka.

Ponerorchis cucullata

Ponerorchis cucullata, formerly Neottianthe cucullata, is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to temperate Eurasia from Poland to Japan, and also to the Himalayas. It is terrestrial, growing from tubers, to a height of up to 30 cm, with pinkish flowers arranged in a one-sided spike. It was placed in several different genera before a study in 2014 showed that it belonged in an expanded "Ponerorchis".
Description.
"Ponerorchis cucullata" grows from more or less ellipsoid tubers. It reaches a height of around 10–30 cm. It has two basal leaves, 5–7 cm long by 1.5–3 cm wide. One or two smaller bract-like leaves occur further up the stem. The pinkish flowers are arranged in a one-sided spike. The lip or labellum is 7–9 mm long and is deeply divided into three lobes, the middle lobe being the longest. The sepals and lateral petals are about 1 mm shorter than the labellum, and together form a "hood". A spur is present, about 6 mm long, slightly expanded at the tip. The viscidia are not enclosed in a "sac" or bursicle.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 as "Orchis cucullata". It was subsequently transferred to a number of genera, including "Gymnadenia" and "Habenaria", before being placed in "Neottianthe" in 1919. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis cucullata".
Distribution.
"Ponerorchis cucullata" has a very wide distribution in temperate regions of Eurasia. In Europe, it is native to Poland and Eastern Europe. In Asia, it is found in Siberia, the Russian Far East, Mongolia, China, Japan and Korea. It is also found in the Himalayas including Nepal.

Soil moisture velocity equation

The soil moisture velocity equation describes the speed that water moves vertically through unsaturated soil under the combined actions of gravity and capillarity, a process known as infiltration. The equation is another form of the Richardson/Richards' equation. The key difference being that the dependent variable is the position of the wetting front formula_1, which is a function of time, the water content and media properties. The soil moisture velocity equation consists of two terms. The first "advection-like" term was developed to simulate surface infiltration and was extended to the water table, which was verified using data collected in a column experimental that was patterned after the famous experiment by Childs &amp; Poulovassilis (1962) and against exact solutions.
Soil moisture velocity equation.
The soil moisture velocity equation or SMVE is a reinterpretation of the Richards' equation wherein the dependent variable is the position "z" of a wetting front of a particular moisture content formula_2 with time.
where:
The first term on the right-hand side of the SMVE is called the "advection-like" term, while the second term is called the "diffusion-like" term. The advection-like term of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation is particularly useful for calculating the advance of wetting fronts for a liquid invading an unsaturated porous medium under the combined action of gravity and capillarity because it is convertible to an ordinary differential equation by neglecting the diffusion-like term. and it avoids the problem of representative elementary volume by use of a fine water-content discretization and solution method.
This equation was converted into a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using the method of lines to convert the partial derivatives on the right-hand side of the equation into appropriate finite difference forms. These three ODEs represent the dynamics of infiltrating water, falling slugs, and capillary groundwater, respectively.
Derivation.
This derivation of the 1-D soil moisture velocity equation for calculating vertical flux formula_11 of water in the vadose zone starts with conservation of mass for an unsaturated porous medium without sources or sinks:
We next insert the unsaturated Buckingham–Darcy flux:
yielding Richards' equation in mixed form because it includes both the water content formula_2and capillary head formula_7:
Applying the chain rule of differentiation to the right-hand side of Richards' equation:
Assuming that the constitutive relations for unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil capillarity are solely functions of the water content, formula_18and formula_19, respectively:
This equation implicitly defines a function formula_21that describes the position of a particular moisture content within the soil using a finite moisture-content discretization. Employing the Implicit function theorem, which by the cyclic rule required dividing both sides of this equation by formula_22 to perform the change in variable, 
resulting in:
formula_23,
which can be written as:
formula_24.
Inserting the definition of the soil water diffusivity:
into the previous equation produces:
formula_26
If we consider the velocity of a particular water content formula_2, then we can write the equation in the form of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation:
formula_28
Physical significance.
Written in moisture content form, 1-D Richards' equation is
Where "D"("θ") [L2/T] is 'the soil water diffusivity' as previously defined.
Note that with formula_2 as the dependent variable, physical interpretation is difficult because all the factors that affect the divergence of the flux are wrapped up in the soil moisture diffusivity term formula_8. However, in the SMVE, the three factors that drive flow are in separate terms that have physical significance.
The primary assumptions used in the derivation of the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation are that formula_32 and formula_33 are not overly restrictive. Analytical and experimental results show that these assumptions are acceptable under most conditions in natural soils. In this case, the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation is equivalent to the 1-D Richards' equation, albeit with a change in dependent variable. This change of dependent variable is convenient because it reduces the complexity of the problem because compared to Richards' equation, which requires the calculation of the divergence of the flux, the SMVE represents a flux calculation, not a divergence calculation. The first term on the right-hand side of the SMVE represents the two scalar drivers of flow, gravity and the integrated capillarity of the wetting front. Considering just that term, the SMVE becomes:
where formula_35 is the capillary head gradient that is driving the flux and the remaining conductivity term formula_36 represents the ability of gravity to conduct flux through the soil. This term is responsible for the true advection of water through the soil under the combined influences of gravity and capillarity. As such, it is called the "advection-like" term.
Neglecting gravity and the scalar wetting front capillarity, we can consider only the second term on the right-hand side of the SMVE. In this case the Soil Moisture Velocity Equation becomes:
This term is strikingly similar to Fick's second law of diffusion. For this reason, this term is called the "diffusion-like" term of the SMVE.
This term represents the flux due to the shape of the wetting front formula_38, divided by the spatial gradient of the capillary head formula_39. Looking at this diffusion-like term, it is reasonable to ask when might this term be negligible? The first answer is that this term will be zero when the first derivative formula_40, because the second derivative will equal zero. One example where this occurs is in the case of an equilibrium hydrostatic moisture profile, when formula_41 with z defined as positive upward. This is a physically realistic result because an equilibrium hydrostatic moisture profile is known to not produce fluxes.
Another instance when the diffusion-like term will be nearly zero is in the case of sharp wetting fronts, where the denominator of the diffusion-like term formula_42, causing the term to vanish. Notably, sharp wetting fronts are notoriously difficult to resolve and accurately solve with traditional numerical Richards' equation solvers.
Finally, in the case of dry soils, formula_6 tends towards formula_44, making the soil water diffusivity formula_8 tend towards zero as well. In this case, the diffusion-like term would produce no flux.
Comparing against exact solutions of Richards' equation for infiltration into idealized soils developed by Ross &amp; Parlange (1994) revealed that indeed, neglecting the diffusion-like term resulted in accuracy &gt;99% in calculated cumulative infiltration. This result indicates that the advection-like term of the SMVE, converted into an ordinary differential equation using the method of lines, is an accurate ODE solution of the infiltration problem. This is consistent with the result published by Ogden et al. who found errors in simulated cumulative infiltration of 0.3% using 263 cm of tropical rainfall over an 8-month simulation to drive infiltration simulations that compared the advection-like SMVE solution against the numerical solution of Richards' equation.
Solution.
The advection-like term of the SMVE can be solved using the method of lines and a finite moisture content discretization. This solution of the SMVE advection-like term replaces the 1-D Richards' equation PDE with a set of three ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These three ODEs are:
Infiltration fronts.
With reference to Figure 1, water infiltrating the land surface can flow through the pore space between formula_46 and formula_47. Using the method of lines to convert the SMVE advection-like term into an ODE:
Given that any ponded depth of water on the land surface is formula_49, the Green and Ampt (1911) assumption is employed,
Note the "-1" in parentheses, representing the fact that gravity and capillarity are acting in opposite directions. The performance of this equation was verified, using a column experiment fashioned after that by Childs and Poulovassilis (1962). Results of that validation showed that the finite water-content vadose zone flux calculation method performed comparably to the numerical solution of Richards' equation. The photo shows apparatus. Data from this column experiment are available by clicking on this hot-linked DOI. These data are useful for evaluating models of near-surface water table dynamics.
It is noteworthy that the SMVE advection-like term solved using the finite moisture-content method completely avoids the need to estimate the specific yield. Calculating the specific yield as the water table nears the land surface is made cumbersome my non-linearities. However, the SMVE solved using a finite moisture-content discretization essentially does this automatically in the case of a dynamic near-surface water table.

Human (Steve Angello album)

Human is the second studio album by Swedish Greek DJ and producer Steve Angello, released on 27 April 2018 through Size Records. The album, which was debuted at Coachella 2017, was initially teased with the release of three separate EPs titled "Genesis", "Inferno", and "Paradiso" throughout 2017 and single "Nothing Scares Me Anymore" in 2018. According to Angello, "Human" is a concept album inspired by a trip to his hometown church in Stockholm during a period where he considered walking away from music, due to his dissatisfication with the constant chase for attention in the social media world.
Background.
After releasing "Wild Youth" in January 2016, Steve Angello announced on his final BBC Radio 1 Residency show in December 2016 that he will be putting out a new solo album in 2017, which he mentioned was "almost done". In his Coachella 2017 performance on April, Angello played multiple singles from the album, although no official release date was confirmed at that time. The album's release was postponed to the next year following Angello's Tweets on Twitter, where he announced a "100% chance" that the album was coming out ahead of 2018.
On 4 August 2017, Angello released the first installment of the album in a form of an EP titled "Genesis" containing singles "Breaking Kind" and "Rejoice". The theme of "Genesis" revolves around Christmas and gospel influences, based on Angello who commented that the EP was his "electronic church". The second installation of the album titled "Inferno" was released on 13 October 2017 consisting of tracks "Freedom" and "I Know".
In an interview with "Billboard" at the time of the EP's unveiling, Angello revealed that he began to question the future direction of his musical career after "Wild Youth"'s release. Angello, aware of his career success, was unsure if he should continue producing music with passion or to take his music as a business by constantly releasing singles to increase his financial wealth. At that time, Angello was actively using Instagram to promote his album, and spent a lot of his time studying market research to maximise his "likes" and streaming presence rather than focusing on his creative potential. Eventually, he thought of successful music artists including Michael Jackson and Pink Floyd who lacked online presence, but managed to bring in fresh musical concepts after touring.
Angello then decided to delete his social media and retreated to his hometown Stockholm to focus on his family. While on his way to the studio one day, Angello stopped by at a closed Orthodox church and meditated at the pews; repeating this practice daily. Angello also listened to many inspirational speeches, and stumbled upon a sermon from West Virginia pastor T. D. Jakes who was motivating his congregation to change their lives for the new year. This struck as inspirational to Angello and he reached out to the church for an audio file of Jakes' sermon, which was later used in his track "Rejoice" as a feature and was the first track produced in his new state of mind.
"Paradiso", the third and final installation, was released on 17 November 2017. The EP represented the "bright light at the end of the tunnel" in stark contrast to "Genesis" and "Inferno" which symbolised restarting again and the dark, sensual elements of life respectively, and contained tracks "Break Me Down" and "Dopamine".
Musically, Angello commented that he was being a "kid" again, creating music which was honest and in his own way of speech. He revealed that in the making of "Rejoice", Angello entered a destruction phase where he stood "naked and honest all alone" to search for higher powers, which became the orthodox church. He asked himself, "What happens after the future? What are we going to believe in and how does that look and feel? Can it work by design?", and upon receiving the answers in the form of biblical references Angello started to write the track.
Release and promotion.
On 19 February 2018, Angello shared snippets of his album through Instagram which featured him listening to a cassette tape, with the tape marked "STEVE ANGELLO | HUMAN 2018". On 5 March 2018, the album's release date was hinted through a picture posted by Angello and Size Records on Instagram which showed a mass of shredded paper with a cryptic message on it.
Upon the album's release, Angello commented, "Human is a concept album that I love. No compromise, unfiltered, and straight to the point. It was rewarding to be able to express this piece of me. After months of disconnect I felt I had to change the way I made music, change the way I thought of music and the way I felt about music."
To promote the album, a "Lifetime Pass" presented in a credit card form was introduced on 1 May 2018. The pass will allow free access to all of the producer’s live solo shows, meet and greets, and backstage access for one's lifetime.
Critical reception.
Kat Bein of "Billboard" wrote that the record "moves from haunting cinematics to gritty electro and feel-good dance rhythms", thus "showcasing the producer's versatility and willingness to experiment". Dylan Barnabe from "Exclaim!" describes "Human" as a "rousing sermon brought to life with fiery synth" that was "best encapsulated" by single "Rejoice". The critic felt that although the album was "overtly biblical in some respects", it still "extends beyond any religious undertones to highlight Angello's own journey to enlightenment" where Angello "dig deep and experiment with new styles and forms of musical expression". Karlie Powell from "Your EDM" found that "heavy synth work, gospel choirs, eerie vibrations and bass-heavy undertones narrate the album throughout" which tells of Angello's "life-changing experience deliberately and thrillingly from the most intense of builds down to the most delicate notes".

She has given various talks at TEDx conferences in India and is a popular face among IPS officers. She is also a playback singer in Kannada cinemas and has sung a song for Kannada film Bayalaatada Bheemanna, starring Ravichandran in the lead.)
Early life and education.
D. Roopa, was born in Davanagere. Her father is J. S. Diwakar, a retired engineer and mother is Hemavathi. She has one younger sister , Rohini Divakar, who is an IRS officer of 2008 batch and is posted as Joint Commissioner Of Income Tax. Rohini was also an NCC cadet and has authored many articles in prominent national dailies.
She completed her graduation from Kuvempu University Karnataka with a gold medal, and post graduation MA in psychology from Bangalore University. Roopa is a well versed with Hindustani Classical music and a trained Bharatnatyam dancer. She has recently released a music video on 2018's International Women's Day to inspire women.
In 2003, she married Munish Moudgil, an alumnus of IIT Bombay and currently an IAS officer. They have two children Anagha and Roshil.
Career.
Roopa cleared her UPSC exam with All-India-rank 43 in 2000. She underwent training at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Police Academy in Hyderabad, where she was ranked 5th in her batch and was allotted to the Karnataka Cadre.
Soon after the training, Roopa was posted as Superintendent of police (SP) in Dharwad district, north Karnataka. She also served as SP in Gadag district, Bidar and finally in Yadgir district, before she moved to Bengaluru.
In 2007, she was given the role of arresting the then Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister and former Union Minister Uma Bharati in relation to a court case in Hubballi. In 2008, she arrested Mr Yavagal, who was an ex-minister. During this case, she also got her subordinate DSP Mr Masooti, suspended for being in continuous touch with Mr Yavagal and tried to protect the guilty.
She became the first lady police officer in the nation to head the Cyber-Crime police station/division, in 2013. While she was the DCP, City Armed Reserve, Bengaluru, she had withdrawn 216 excess gunmen kept unauthorisedly by 81 politicians. She also had withdrawn 8 new SUVs of the department that unauthorisedly remained with an ex-Chief Minister of Karnataka.
In July 2017, Roopa was transferred from her post as Deputy Inspector General Prisons, a post she took over barely a month ago to the commissioner for traffic and road safety, days after she found irregularities inside the jail. She alleged that AIADMK (Amma) general secretary V K Sasikala was enjoying VIP treatment at Parappana Agrahara central prison.

<doc id="56912213" url="?curid=56912213" title="Moroccan cantillation">
Moroccan cantillation

Moroccan cantillation (also referred to as Moroccan Te'amim, ( or ) refers primarily to the style and tune used by Jews of Moroccan descent when reading the Torah. It may also refer to the tune used when reading the other books of the Tanach, and to a lesser degree, the Mishna. The Moroccan rite is distinct from other Sephardic, Yemenite and Ashkenazic cantillations and is considered to be a category unto itself.
Torah.
The names of the cantillation notes (Te'amim) used by Moroccan Jews are similar to those used by other Sephardic communities, although their tunes are different. Moroccan Te'amim generally fit into the Makam scales of Zidane and Higaz while Yerushalmi Te'amim are considered to be classified as Makam Sigah.
Ta'am Elyon.
In mainstream parlance, Ta'am Elyon refers to the alternate cantillation used to read the Ten Commandments. However, in the Moroccan community, it is also used to refer to the special cantillation used in certain sections of the Torah portions of Beshalach and Yitro. Specifically, Ta'am Elyon refers to the alternate tune in the Tarḥa and Sof Pasuk cantillations at the end of certain verses in those Torah portions.
Tanach.
Haftara.
Moroccan Jews also have a distinct cantillation when reading the Haftara. The Moroccan cantillation for the Haftara can be further subdivided into the tune used by the general Moroccan community and that of the Spanish Moroccan community. Generally, this difference can be observed on ordinary Shabbatot, but on holidays, the Spanish Moroccans use the same tune as the general Moroccan community. Furthermore, there is a custom among some Moroccans to use the Spanish Moroccan tune for the Haftara that is read on Tisha B'Av. There exists a difference between the Darga and Tevir cantillations depending on if they are in the middle of a verse or closer to the end of a verse. If there are two sets of Darga and Tevir, they are always read in the two different tunes.
Tlata DePuranuta.
On the Shabbatot that fall during the Three Weeks, special Haftarot are read whose themes deal with the Jewish exile and other calamities. In the Moroccan rite there is a special, solemn tune used to read these Haftarot, in line with the mournful period of the year. There are some opinions which maintain that such a tune is inappropriate since any public forms of mourning are forbidden on Shabbat, even during the Three Weeks.
Psalms.
The cantillation used for Tehillim can also be subdivided into the Moroccan and the Spanish Moroccan rites. The tune used by Spanish Moroccans is that which is used to read Psalms at funerals by other Moroccans.
Shir Hashririm.
As with other Sephardic communities, Shir Hashirim is chanted during Kabbalat Shabbat as well as at the end of the Seder. This too has its own unique cantillation in the Moroccan community. "Megillat Ruth", which is traditionally read on Shavuot, has a tune which is very similar to that of Shir Hashirim, with some minor differences. The book of Job also has a similar tune.

Myrtle Cagle

Myrtle "Kay" Thompson Cagle (June 3, 1925 – December 22, 2019) was an American pilot and one of the Mercury 13 female astronauts group. She worked as a flight instructor and wrote about aviation in North Carolina.
Biography.
Pre-Mercury 13.
Cagle was born on June 3, 1925 in North Carolina. Cagle had always wanted to fly from a young age. When she was 12, her brothers taught her to fly using the plane they owned. When she "earned her wings" at the age of 14, she was the youngest pilot in North Carolina, and at the time, may have been the youngest in the United States. She joined the high school's aeronautics class, when the school's instructor was drafted to fight in World War II, she finished out her year as the teacher. As a Flight Instructor she was nicknamed, "Captain K". Cagle earned her private pilot's license when she was nineteen.
Cagle joined the Civil Air Patrol and the Ninety-Nines, and wanted to become a WASP. Cagle went on to run an airport near Raleigh and her own charter plane service. In 1950, she earned a trophy in the Powder Puff Derby. She earned her Commercial Pilots license with Airplane Single and Multi-Engine Land ratings and Instrument ratings by 1951. She was also a certified Flight Instructor, Flight Instrument Instructor and Ground Instructor. Her flight school was located in Selma.
Cagle began writing a column called "Air Currents" in 1946 for the "Johnstonian Sun" newspaper in Selma. Later the column was moved to the "Raleigh News and Observer" from 1953 to 1960. When she flew a T-33 jet trainer, she became one of only five women who had "ever piloted a jet."
Mercury 13.
Cagle married former pupil, Walt Cagle, in 1960. Her wedding dress was made from parachutes. She moved to Macon, Georgia, in 1961. Not long after she arrived, she was invited to participate in the new Women in Space Program. Cagle had 4,300 hours of flying time by the time the program started. Cagle and the twelve other women participants eventually became known as the "Mercury 13." During the program, Cagle was warned by the administrators not to become pregnant. Among the multitude of tests she underwent as part of the program, she noted that one of the worst tests she faced was having her eardrums frozen.
Post-Mercury 13.
Cagle went back to teaching students how to fly and also enrolled in Mercer University. She continued to be involved in the Civil Air Patrol. In 1964, she competed in the International Women's Air Race. In 1986, she became a member of the Warner Robins Air Logistics Team. In 1988, Cagle became the second woman to graduate with an airframe and powerplant mechanic's rating from the Georgia Technical Institute. She was still flying her single-engine Cessna in 1998 at age 73, even though she had retired from teaching at Robins Air Force Base. On April 26, 2003, Cagle was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame. In 2007, she and eight of the Mercury 13 graduates earned an honorary doctorate from the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh.
Death.
Cagle died on December 22, 2019.

Career, honours and retirement.
Milne joined the Scottish Office as an Assistant Principal in 1921. After seven years he was promoted to be Private Secretary to the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office. Two years later, he became Private Secretary to the Secretary of State and in 1935 he was promoted to Assistant Secretary to head up the Scottish Office's new Local Government Branch in Edinburgh, which was meant to enable Scottish people and institutions to meet with government officials without having to travel to the Scottish Office in London. Four years later, Milne was promoted to Deputy Secretary at the new Scottish Home Department, and he was promoted to become its Secretary in 1942. Milne's final promotion in the civil service was to be Permanent Under-Secretary to the Scottish Office, in which office he served from 1946 until his retirement in 1959.
Milne wrote "The Scottish Office" in 1958, a guide to its organisation and operation. In retirement, he was a Governor of the BBC in Scotland (1960–65) and Chairman of the Scottish National Orchestra Society (1961–70). He had been appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 Birthday Honours, and was promoted to Knight Commander in the 1947 New Year Honours, followed by Knight Grand Cross in the 1958 Birthday Honours. He died on 4 February 1972; his wife, Winifrede (the daughter of Surgeon-Captain L. Kilroy), had died two years prior, leaving two children.
Assessment.
Milne had what Ian Levitt called in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" a "brand of comfortable unionism ... his administrative style and ability to select deputies of similar mind did much to ensure that Scottish opinion felt able to work and prosper with the United Kingdom government." His obituary in "The Times" remarked that "Only those who were at Dover House in those days [the Scottish Office in London during the minority Labour government of 1929–31] can appreciate how much his sympathy, his tact, and his capacity for getting into the mind of Ministers and acting as an interpreter between them and their civil servants contributed to the smooth running of the administration". Later while Milne was its Permanent Under-Secretary, the Scottish Office grew and increasingly came to argue for the peculiarity of Scotland and the need for its consideration during policy-making. This, Levitt argues, reflected Milne's desire to stem the growth of Scottish nationalism; the result was a series of concessions to Scotland in the 1940s and 1950s in the form of lower tax rates but equivalent spending to England.

In an interview with the Official Charts Company, Steve Garrigan said, "I'm very excited! We worked with Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid on this one. It’s kind of a new sound for us. My comfort zone is in slow ballads – this is not a slow ballad in any sense. Steve Mac was amazing… to share a room with him was an honour really. I think it’s pretty commercial, the single. Every song we’ve done is different, but this is probably the most mainstream."

After School Matters

After School Matters (ASM) is a non-profit organization that provides Chicago high school teens with after-school and summer opportunities. It offers project-based after-school and summer programs in the arts, communications and leadership, sports and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).
History and background.
After School Matters was originally founded by the former first lady of the City of Chicago, Maggie Daley, during her husband Richard M. Daley's term as mayor. Gallery 37 was the predecessor to the organization, which offered after school programs focusing primarily on the arts. In 2000, After School Matters was formed and began offering Chicago teenagers a wider range of programs, including programs from Gallery 37.
When the youth organization first launched as Gallery 37, 260 kids were enrolled that summer. Over 200,000 teenagers have been associated with or members of After School Matters since its launch.
Mellody Hobson has served as the president since 2012.
Demographics.
After School Matters works with the local Chicago adolescent population between the ages of 14 and 19 years old. Over 90% of its participants identify as ethnic minorities.
Programs and partnerships.
Programs are offered in forms of apprenticeships and internships that cover areas such as science, sports, technology, college readiness skills, and communication. Programs are offered in three sessions: Summer, Fall, and Spring.
The organization works with various organizations across Chicago and other corporate entities. Some include, West Town Bikes, Forward Momentum, 1871, The Chicago Fire Foundation, and Bank of America, who further provide teenagers with programs.
Art.
Programs under the arts primarily fall under performing, visual and culinary arts. These include theater, graphic design, choir, catering, and printmaking.
Communications and leadership.
Programs are offered in business, journalism, marketing, media, and social science. Some examples are documentary video, creative writing and debate.
After School Matters and the USC Shoah Foundation partnered to create a program called "iWitness", which teaches leadership skills and in understanding public political discourse. The students were also able to develop their own contributions to the political debate via social media.
Sports.
Sports instruction, stadium management, health and wellness, and sports-related programs such as soccer and lifeguarding are offered via After School Matters.
A partnership with West Town Bikes allows for students to attend a program were they can learn about cycling, rules on the road, transportation, and even how to repair bikes. The program offers students the opportunity to build their own bikes as well as earn a stipend at the end of the program.
STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
Programs offered are applied and natural science, audio/visual technology, industrial technology, and information technology.
A partnership with 1871, a technology and entrepreneurship company, allows students to apply for internship positions at the company and work in event planning and community outreach.
After School Matters Annual Gala.
Every year After School Matters holds a gala to celebrate its members' accomplishments and collect funds to support its programs. This platform has been used as a showcase for many of the teenage members' work and contributions to the general public and outside contributors. In 2016 the program held its 25th annual gala at Navy Pier and raised a total of $4.5 million.
Funding and notable donations.
After School Matters sustains itself through grants and donations.
In 2013 a $25 million donation, given in $5 million increments, was made to the program by filmmaker George Lucas and Mellody Hobson through the George Lucas Foundation. The donation funded a $275 to $425 student stipend, which had been cut during the recession. In 2013 the City of Chicago invested $12.2 million in the program. Donations were also made by former Chicago Bulls players Michael Jordan and Derrick Rose, who donated $1 million in 2014.
Controversies.
Linda Wutton of WBEZ found that teenagers who were paid $5 an hour in 2009 would now make $1.10 due to pay cuts in the program despite an increase in After School Matter's budget. Students who were previously earning a $400 stipend for a program would be receiving $100 for the same program the following year. Board member, Avis Lavele, of After School Matters claimed that the cuts were made to focus on eliminating clubs and bringing in more beneficial programs without reducing the number of students involved with After School Matters.

1892 United States presidential election in Tennessee

The 1892 United States presidential election in Tennessee took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. Tennessee voters chose twelve electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Background and vote.
For over a century after the Civil War, Tennessee’s white citizenry was divided according to partisan loyalties established in that war. Unionist regions covering almost all of East Tennessee, Kentucky Pennyroyal-allied Macon County, and the five West Tennessee Highland Rim counties of Carroll, Henderson, McNairy, Hardin and Wayne voted Republican – generally by landslide margins – as they saw the Democratic Party as the “war party” who had forced them into a war they did not wish to fight. Contrariwise, the rest of Middle and West Tennessee who had supported and driven the state’s secession was equally fiercely Democratic as it associated the Republicans with Reconstruction. After the state’s white landowning class re-established its rule in the early 1870s, black and Unionist white combined to forge adequate support for the GOP to produce a competitive political system for two decades, although during this era the Republicans could only capture statewide offices when the Democratic Party was divided on this issue of payment of state debt. 
White Democrats in West Tennessee were always aiming to eliminate black political influence, which they first attempted to do by election fraud in the middle 1880s and did so much more successfully at the end of the decade by instituting in counties with significant black populations a secret ballot that prevented illiterates voting, and a poll tax throughout the state. This largely eradicated Republican support in secessionist areas as freedmen became no longer able to vote.
At the time of the next presidential election, third-time Democratic nominee Grover Cleveland was extremely concerned with the lack of loyalty to the gold standard by Tennessee Democrats and the growing influence of the James B. Weaver-led Populist Party over the state, especially after Governor John P. Buchanan joined the Populists and ran for re-election under that party’s banner However, the strong emphasis by Cleveland and running mate Adlai Stevenson I on opposing the Lodge Force Bill and on reducing tariffs was able to minimise defections to the Populists or the GOP – which with large Unionist areas was even with incomplete black disenfranchisement more viable than in any other ex-Confederate state. Stevenson’s extensive tour of Tennessee and his campaign against the Populists ensured that the state was won comfortably against incumbent President and Republican nominee Benjamin Harrison, whose vote total declined by thirty-eight thousand or over a quarter due to the loss of black voters.

Jerri Sloan Truhill

Geraldine "Jerri" Hamilton Sloan Truhill (November 12, 1929 – November 18, 2013) was an American aviator. She was part of the "Mercury 13", the group of women who underwent the same physiological tests as the Mercury Seven during the same time frame. She served as the Vice President for Air Freighters International and Air Services, Inc. Truhill died on November 18, 2013.
Early life.
Truhill was first exposed to aviation a young age, but due to the restrictive views on women pilots during the era, she was often discouraged from pursuing the career. When she was 15, she began taking flying lessons without the knowledge of her parents. After this was discovered, she was sent to a Catholic School in San Antonio, Texas.
Aviation career and Mercury 13.
Truhill spent much of her time based out of Dallas, Texas, where she began a partnership with Joe Truhill, who she would eventually marry. She and Joe flew North American B-25's under Texas Instruments, Incorporated. Through this, she helped to develop Terrain Following Radar (TFR) and smart bombs. Truhill also participated in numerous Air Races.
In 1961, she got a call from friend Jerrie Cobb, asking for her interest in a secret government project, which would turn out to be the Women in Space Program run by Dr. William Randolph Lovelace, who ran an astronaut testing center for NASA in Albuquerque, N.M. Through Dr. Lovelace, the women went through the same Mercury era testing as the men.
After the program was halted, the Truhills bought and flew a P-51 Mustang, during which she also modeled a pink lycra flight suit for Monsanto. She bought a house in Richardson, where she lived until her death.
"She Should Have Gone to the Moon".
Truhill was the subject of the 2008 documentary "She Should Have Gone to the Moon" which was based upon a series of lengthy conversations between Truhill an director Ulrike Kubatta in which she tells the story of the Mercury 13 programme in her own words and from her own point of view. The interviews are augmented, supported and illustrated by archive footage and stylised reconstruction sequences. Truhill recounts details of her training, and that of other women trainees, reflects on the achievements of American female pilots and astronauts (notably ignoring Soviet women such as Valentina Tereshkova), and on her personal story including her pre-Mercury 13 work with flight testing new equipment for Texas Instruments up to and during the Bay of Pigs incident, and her personally confronting Lyndon Johnson at a fundraiser to challenge the cessation of the Women in Space programme.

Soviet Indoor Athletics Championships

The Soviet Indoor Athletics Championships () was an annual indoor track and field competition organised by the Soviet Athletics Federation, which served as the Soviet national championship for the sport. Typically held over two to three days in February during the Soviet winter, it was a later development to the national programme, supplementing the main outdoor Soviet Athletics Championships held in the summer.
History.
Indoor athletics at a national level began to take shape in the Soviet Union from 1940 onwards, in the form of winter indoor matches between teams from Moscow and Leningrad, then expanding to cities including Kiev, Kharkov, and Odessa. The early history of event is linked to that of the All-Union Winter Competitions (), which were first held in 1949 and included outdoor throwing events and racewalking.
The event took the form of an indoor track and field championship in 1971 and a total of 22 athletics events (12 for men, 10 for women) were contested. The competition also featured a team element, with athletes' performances counting towards a points total for the Soviet Republic or major city that they represented. By the end of the competition's history, a total of 28 events (15 by men, 13 by women) were contested, with pole vault and steeplechase being the only events to remain for men only. With the exception of the indoor steeplechase, in its later years the championships programme roughly aligned with that of the IAAF World Indoor Championships (first held in 1987).
The last Soviet Indoor Athletics Championships was hosted in Volgograd in 1991 and it ceased thereafter due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. A final shared championships was held in 1992 between the Commonwealth of Independent States, after which point the newly independent nations hosted their own national championship events.
Events.
The following athletics events featured as standard on the main Soviet Indoor Championships programme:
Indoor versions of the 110 metres hurdles and 100 metres hurdles were held at the first three editions, before being dropped. Men and women also competed over 100 metres in 1972 and 1973. Races over 600 metres were contested by men and women in the first two editions, then 1000 metres in 1973, before the events were standardised to the international class 800 m and 1500 m. A one-off men's weight throw was also held in 1975. The 1976 programme had a one-off change, dropping the 400 m in favour of men's and women's 300 m and 600 m races. Women's 3000 m race were held between 1975 and 1977. The 100 m sprint and 110/100 hurdles were also reintroduced between 1978 and 1980. The 200 metres for men and women began in 1982, as did a women's 3000 metres, and a women's triple jump was introduced at the final edition in 1991. 
The 1977 championships featured the 10,000 metres race walk for the first time. A women's race walk over 5000 m was first held in 1981, but both walks were dropped in 1982. The walks returned with 5000 m and 3000 m races for men and women, respectively, in 1989 and remained present until 1991.
The steeplechase had a very varied history at the competition, given limitations at the scheduled venue. It was contested by men only, as the event was not regularly contested by women during this period. A men's 2000 metres steeplechase was added to the programme in 1978. It was extended to the standard 3000 m distance in 1982, reinstated over 2000 m for 1985 and 1986, returned to 3000 m in 1987, 1990 and 1991, and dropped at the 1984, 1988 and 1989 editions.
Combined track and field events were held jointly at early editions of the competitions. A men's pentathlon and women's triathlon were held in 1975, and then moved to the international standard of men's heptathlon and women's pentathlon in 1977. The Soviet Combined Events Championships were contested separately from 1978 onwards.

Tiger (1800 ship)

Tiger was launched at Liverpool in 1800 as a West Indiaman. She made one voyage in 1806-1807 as a slave ship. She then returned to the West Indies trade. She also captured three American merchant vessels in 1813. She wrecked on 30 September 1819 with loss of life.
Career.
"Tiger" appears in "Lloyd's Register" in 1800 with M. Hays, master, W. Goore (or Gore), owner, and trade Liverpool–Jamaica. In 1803 T. Oxton replaced Hays as master. In late March 1805 "Tiger", Oxton, master, put into Savannah. She had grounded while sailing from Jamaica to Liverpool.
In late 1805 Gore sold "Tiger" to Fletcher &amp; Co. Her master changed from Oxton to Kneal, and her trade from Liverpool−Jamaica to Liverpool−Africa. 
Captain Charles Kneale acquired a letter of marque on 21 April 1806. He sailed from Liverpool on 16 May 1806, bound for the Bight of Biafra and Gulf of Guinea islands. "Tiger" gathered her slaves at Bonny and arrived at Montego Bay on 5 December. She had embarked 433 slaves and she landed 389, for a loss rate of 10.2%. She left Jamaica on 7 April 1807 and arrived back at Liverpool on 16 July. She had left Liverpool with 50 crew members and she suffered one crew death on the voyage.
On her return "Tiger" underwent a good repair and Barton &amp; Co. purchased her. Captain William Field Porter became her master and her trade became Liverpool–Barbados.
"Tiger" and , also owned by Barton &amp; Co., left Barbados on 12 March 1808 and were reported on 22 April to have arrived at Liverpool.
On 24 July, "Tiger", Porter, master, sailed from Barbados and was reported on 6 September to have arrived back at Liverpool.
On 29 November 1811 Captain Porter stood trial at London for having taken on board "Tiger" at Carlisle Bay, Barbados, two deserters from the Royal Navy and having concealed them when the Navy sent a Lieutenant to look for them. (Apparently he had concealed more than two, but the charges only related to two.) Porter was found guilty and fined £500 and to be held at Newgate for 12 months or until he had paid his fine. 
On 11 January 1813, "Tiger" sailed from Barbados in company with , which too belonged to Barton &amp; Co. On their way they captured two American vessels that they sent into Barbados: "Lavinia", which had been sailing from Cadiz to Savannah, and "Rising States", which had been sailing from Salem to St. Jago. "Maxwell" and "Tiger" captured a third vessel, "Manilla", which had been sailing from the South Seas to America. However a British sloop-of-war took "Manilla" from them near the Western Isles and sent her into Plymouth. "Maxwell" arrived at Liverpool and "Tiger" at Tuskar. "Lavinia" arrived at Barbados on 29 January. "Rising States" also reached Barbados. "Manilla", M'Clure, master, arrived at Plymouth on 23 February. The British government made a cartel of "Rising States" and sent her to Providence, Rhode Island, with 180 American prisoners from Barbados and St Bartholomews.
In 1813 "Tiger" underwent a large repair. That year her master changed to J. Hull, who sailed her in the Liverpool–Madeira trade. The next year her master changed from Hull to R. Higgin(s), and her trade returned to Liverpool–Barbados.
On 18 April 1816 "Tiger" grounded at Mockbeggar while setting out for Barbados. She was refloated the next morning and returned to the River. By the 24th "Tiger" was at and on her way to Barbados.
In 1818 T. Smith replaced Higgins as master of "Tiger".
Fate.
"Tiger", Smith, master, was lost on 30 September 1819 near the Saltee Islands while returning to Liverpool from Barbados. Only four of the 30 crew and passengers aboard survived.

Sarah Lavalley

Sarah (née Aird) Lavalley (1895-1991) was a nurse, craftswoman, and community leader from Golden Lake Reserve. In addition to her social work, she is known for supporting cultural exchange between the Indigenous community that she was a part of and non-Indigenous people, as well as supporting cultural continuity through her teaching throughout her life. Lavalley was also known as a skilled maker using traditional patterns and stitching techniques, making wearable crafts like moccasins and mittens for instance.
Early life.
Sarah Lavalley was born on April 28, 1895 on Golden Lake (Algonquins of Pikwakanagan First Nation) Reserve. Lavalley attended a day school until grade nine on Golden Lake Reserve, and attended high school in Eganville. Lavalley left school to support her family working as a household servant in Eganville and Ottawa. Lavalley also helped her grandmother Annie Mitchell with midwifery from the age of fourteen. This formative experience led to her completing some training at the Good Samaritan Catholic Hospital in Jersey City, New Jersey, at age nineteen.
Sarah married James Lavalley in 1916. On the occasion of their fiftieth wedding anniversary the couple received letters of congratulations from political figures including Governor General Georges Vanier, Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, Agriculture Minister Joe Greene, and Senator Norman McLeod Paterson, revealing some of the high-profile relationships that Lavalley had established. Other than a couple of brief periods spent in Ottawa and Timmins, Ontario, Sarah lived primarily on Golden Lake Reserve throughout her life. She had eight children and forty-three grandchildren.
Community contributions.
Lavalley developed a reputation as a dedicated nurse at Golden Lake Reserve and Village, serving 600 villagers and 300 inhabitants on the reserve, addressing the inaccessibility of the nearest hospital. Lavalley was president of the Golden Lake Branch of the Catholic Women’s League and the Golden Lake Homemaker’s Club, where she encouraged women from the community to meet and develop skills, particularly in Indigenous crafts. Lavalley fostered cultural exchange when she taught Indigenous and non-Indigenous women craftwork and beadwork. Lavalley’s work appeared regularly since the 1940s in the Indian Crafts Pavilion at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, and was sold nationally, in United States, and in Europe. She also led the Algonquin Crafts project, which provided an opportunity for makers on the reserve to sell their work.
Later in her life, Sarah Lavalley acted as a consultant for linguistics research and was included in several publications, such as “Kinship Terms in Golden Lake Algonquin” by George F. Aubin, and "Restoring the Balance: First Nations Women, Community, and Culture" edited by Gail Guthrie Valaskakis, Eric Guimond, and Madeleine Dion Stout.
Awards.
Sarah Lavalley was awarded the Ontario Order of Good Citizenship Medal in June 1980. Lavalley became a member of the Order of Canada in 1981. Shortly afterwards, Lavalley was awarded the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice medal by Pope John Paul II. She was also one of the recipients of the Union of Ontario Indians Lifetime Achievement Award in 1999.

First Baptist Church (Savannah, Georgia)

First Baptist Church is a historic congregation in Savannah, Georgia, which was first established in 1800. Today, the congregation worships in a Greek-Revival church building on Bull Street, on the western side of Chippewa Square in the historic district of Savannah. This location has been the congregation’s home since 1833 and the building is architecturally significant, being the oldest surviving church building in Savannah.
When initially chartered in 1800, the congregation worshipped at a meeting house on Franklin Square. The church received its perpetual charter the following year by Georgia Governor Josiah Tattnall. The current church building was designed by architect Elias Carter. The cornerstone was laid on February 2, 1831, and two years later, with construction complete, the congregation relocated to its present location. Six years after moving into the current building, the growing congregation began renovations to expand the sanctuary.
By 1947, the congregation was using the name "First" Baptist Church to distinguish itself from other Baptist congregations in the city.
It is one of the few Southern churches to have remained open through the entirety of the American Civil War. The church utilized local architect Henrik Wallin for the notable alterations that occurred in 1922. Renovations included extending the front of the building, cladding the building in limestone, and removing the cupola.
Previous pastors include W. L. Pickard, later president of Mercer University, and Norman Cox, the executive secretary of the Historical Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention.

Small and medium-sized enterprises in Azerbaijan

Small and medium-sized enterprises are called as KOS (kiçik və orta sahibkarlıq) or KOM (kiçik və orta müəssisələr) in Azerbaijan. SMEs have a leading position in the provision of economic growth and employment in Azerbaijan.
Classification of SMEs.
Azerbaijan also gave their categorization both relating to the number of employees work at the company and annual turnover. Categorization of enterprises is indicated like below:
Governmental Statistic Committee defined this classification by taking into account various economic fields as below.
Small and medium-sized enterprises are divided into two groups in Azerbaijan.
In term of the number of enterprises and employees, individual enterprises occupy the main part of the small and medium-sized business field. According to the data of the Statistics Committee for the year 2015, the number of small businesses in all economic sectors of the country, was 196 327. The number of small entrepreneurs has increased in 2015 about 9 429 people compared to 2014. In addition, 178 163 of them were individual entrepreneurs. Individual entrepreneur mostly agglomerated in the sectors, especially trade, and take more revenues instead of minimum investments. Only a small number of entrepreneurs takes part in business activities, which requires high early investments and makes profit in the long-term. On average, individual entrepreneurs employ fewer people and in this way they decrease their expenditures and make more profit.
Legal entities are registered by central administrations of ministries and agencies, and inspected carefully by them. Small enterprise is an entrepreneurship that is controlled by legal entity and indicated in the disposal of the Ministry Cabinet. In this disposal the main principles for small and medium-sized enterprises are indicated.
Programs for SME development.
Direct the development of entrepreneurship in Azerbaijan started in 1990s. On December 12, 1992 government established "Regulations of the Republic of Azerbaijan National Entrepreneurship Support Fund". The approval of this fund let small and medium-sized enterprises take advantage from preferential loans. However, until 2001 the mechanism of the delivery to the entrepreneurship entities did not work properly. Heydar Aliyev’s on August 27, 2002 issued decree resulted the approval of "Regulations on National Entrepreneurship Support Fund of Azerbaijan Republic" and " The use of fund of National Entrepreneurship Support Fund of Azerbaijan Guidelines” was directed to the development of a mechanism for financing of investment projects of entrepreneurs. The began to issue loans with lower interest rates in the national currency, as well as, identification of the grace period to the first two-thirds parts of loans and credit’s low percentage caused arising interest to these credits.

1847 Nagano earthquake

The occurred at about 21:30 local time on 8 May. It had a magnitude of 7.4 on the surface wave magnitude scale. It caused the destruction of many houses in Nagano and at least 8,600 people were killed. The earthquake triggered many landslides, the largest of which dammed the Sai River (a tributary of the Shinano River). 19 days later, the failure of this earthquake dam caused a flood that destroyed many more houses and killed a further 35 people.
Tectonic setting.
During the middle of the Miocene period Japan was affected by the opening of the Sea of Japan as a back-arc basin in response to continuing subduction of the Pacific Plate. This period of extensional tectonics caused the development of rift basins on the western side of Honshu, including the northern part of the Fossa Magna. When the back-arc spreading stopped during the late Miocene, the rifted area started to shorten and the basins became inverted. The western margin of the Nagano Basin, part of the Fossa Magna, is formed by an active reverse fault zone, the West Nagano Basin Fault. The 1847 earthquake was caused by rupture on part of this fault zone.
Landslides.
The earthquake triggered a large number of landslides, due mainly the relatively unconsolidated Miocene sediments. At least seven of these formed dams on rivers in the surrounding area. The largest of these dams was formed at the foot of Mount Iwakura from a landslide with an estimated volume of 20 million cubic metres that blocked the Sai River. The water held back by the dam eventually broke through 19 days after the earthquake, flooding a large area downstream from the dam.

Traffik (film)

Traffik is a 2018 American thriller film directed and written by Deon Taylor and starring Paula Patton, Omar Epps, Laz Alonso, Roselyn Sanchez, Luke Goss, William Fichtner, and Missi Pyle. It follows a group of friends who are terrorized by a gang of bikers in a remote countryside home. It was released on April 20, 2018, by Summit Entertainment, received generally unfavorable reviews from critics and grossed $9 million worldwide.
Plot.
Brea (Paula Patton) is a journalist for the Sacramento Post, who is upset to find that a rival journalist is covering a major scandal story that she had been trying to get published for months. Brea confronts her boss, Carl (William Fichtner), who says her story is just a fluff piece and threatens to fire her.
Brea goes out for a birthday dinner with her boyfriend John (Omar Epps) and their friends Darren (Laz Alonso) and Malia (Roselyn Sanchez). Darren ruins a surprise that John has planned for Brea: to take her on a romantic getaway in the California mountains. The ladies then go to the bathroom and Brea tells Malia she thinks John might propose while they are away, but says she is not ready for that yet.
John surprises Brea with a car he built in his shop as they head off on their vacation. They stop at a gas station where Brea meets a scared-looking woman named Cara (Dawn Olivieri). She says to Brea "Sure feels a lot like the Fourth of July, doesn't it?" before an angry biker guy interrupts and orders Cara to hurry up so they can leave. Outside, another biker from the group is bugging John. John tells him he does not want trouble, leading the biker to spit on his car. John responds by punching him in the face and the biker then pulls out a knife. As Brea rushes over, Sheriff Marnes (Missi Pyle) intervenes and tells the bikers to stay away.
Moments later on the road, one of the bikers starts to follow John and Brea, demanding they pull over. John speeds up then stops suddenly to cause the biker to swerve off the road and roll down a hill. Back at the gas station, the bikers' leader, Red (Luke Goss), chastises his group for drawing attention to themselves and failing to get their hands on Brea.
The couple arrive at their vacation house and spend the afternoon together in the pool. Their evening is disrupted when Darren and Malia make an unannounced visit, despite Darren making Malia believe that John was cool with it. The couples hang out until Darren gets a phone call letting him know that an athlete he represents just got jailed. They then hear a ringing sound coming from Brea's bag. She finds a satellite phone and realizes that Cara slipped it into her bag. Thinking about her Fourth of July comment, Brea figures out that it is a pass-code and they unlock the phone. They find hundreds of pictures of battered women posing for ads, making the couples realize that she is part of a trafficking ring. 
Brea decides to call the police, but Darren stops her, suggesting she only wants to get involved to be able to write about it to get her job back. They argue, and Darren reveals that John and Malia hooked up long before they knew either Brea or Darren. An upset Malia breaks up with Darren and leaves. Moments later, there is a knock at the door, and it is Cara. She asks for her phone back but Brea offers to help her. Cara becomes angry and runs away. John, Brea and Darren attempt to follow her, only to see Red and the biker gang turn on their headlights. When Cara tells Red she did not get the phone back, he shoots her in the head. The three run back into the house and Darren demands that they give up the phone. He goes outside and sees Malia's bag, realising the bikers have her. He tries to make a deal with Red to exchange the phone for Malia but Red declines. Darren tries to pull his own gun on them, but the bikers stab him repeatedly before Red shoots him dead.
John and Brea escape the house through the garage and run into the woods as they are pursued by the bikers. One of them catches up to them and attacks John with a knife, but Brea hits him with a large branch before John gets hold of the knife and stabs him. The couple then run to a cabin where an old man lives. He lets them inside to use the phone to call 911. A biker arrives and shoots the old man before attacking the couple. The biker fights John and shoots him in the side before Brea stabs him in the back. John manages to take the gun from the biker and shoots him in the head, but his own wound is fatal. He tells Brea to get the old man's car keys and reaffirms his love for her before dying. Brea finds the engagement ring that John was planning to propose with, and she wears it for him.
Brea goes outside to try to start the car, but Red and the last biker find her. Before they can take her, Marnes arrives with a deputy following John's phone call. However, Marnes turns out to be part of the trafficking scheme, and she shoots and kills the deputy. She then berates Red and the biker for manhandling the girls since they are products, as well as not deleting the evidence on the phone. They sedate Brea and take her away.
Brea wakes up in a hidden location with other trafficked women, including Malia. Red enters and tells Brea he is keeping her all to himself. He begins to sexually assault her and she responds by sticking a nail in his neck before bludgeoning him to death. The biker attacks Brea but Malia overdoses him with his sedative. Brea promises she will come back for Malia before going to get help. After leaving the woods, she finds herself near the gas station from before. Inside, she asks the clerk to call the police, and Marnes answers the phone. Brea also swipes a cell phone and calls Carl for help.
After dark, Marnes arrives for Brea. She orders her outside to arrest her. Brea asks Marnes if she takes any pride in trafficking women for profit. Marnes responds that everything is trafficked and she is just part of the system. Brea tells Marnes it is slavery and calls her a traitor to all women. Marnes cuffs Brea and takes her outside, only for a whole squad of cops to show up. Marnes is arrested, and the cops rescue all of the trafficked women.
Months later back in Sacramento, Brea returns to work where Carl tells her that the trafficking ring bust will be big news everywhere and that the people involved will most likely go after Brea. She simply replies "Let them come" before walking out.
The film ends with real life statistics about sex trafficking, revealing 1.9 million women are currently being trafficked in the United States.

Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum

Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum (; born 5 December 1985) is an Emirati sheikha and a member of the Dubai ruling family. Her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is the prime minister of the UAE, and her mother, Huriah Ahmed al M'aash, is from Algeria.
She has two half-sisters with the same name. She is the full sister of Sheikha Maitha (born 1980), Sheikha Shamsa (born 1981), and Sheikh Majid (born 1987).
Sheikha Latifa escaped from Dubai in late February 2018 and was forcibly returned from international waters near the Indian coast by a joint India–Emirates operation on 4 March 2018. In December 2018, the Dubai royal court said that she was back in Dubai. She was believed to be held against her will under the order of her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. In August 2021, following her appearance in public spaces in Dubai, Spain, Iceland, and after discussion with Latifa herself, the FreeLatifa campaign was announced as being ended successfully. A call was made to continue to gently monitor her situation.
Early life.
Sheikha Latifa is one of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's children. Her mother is Huriah Ahmed al M’aash.
In a video statement, Sheikha Latifa said that she and her brother Sheikh Majid spent their early childhood under the care of their paternal aunt. Her early education was at the Dubai English Speaking School and later at the International School of Choueifat, with one year at the Latifa School for Girls. Sheikha Latifa is an experienced skydiver, coached by former world champion skydiver Stefania Martinengo, and held accelerated freefall instructor rating.
In 2002, at the age of 16 years, a first attempt by Sheikha Latifa to escape ended in her capture at the UAE-Oman border; she was subsequently jailed for three years and four months. She claimed in the video statement to have been kept in solitary confinement and subject to "constant torture", physically through beatings and mentally, during her arrest.
2018 disappearance.
On 24 February 2018, Sheikha Latifa and her Finnish friend Tiina Jauhiainen left Dubai in a car and crossed the border to Oman. They left Oman on jet skis and joined American–French citizen and former French intelligence officer Hervé Jaubert and his crew on the yacht "Nostromo". Two days later, she made contact with Radha Stirling of Detained in Dubai, notifying Stirling of her departure from Dubai. She also posted a few departing messages on her verified Instagram social media account.
On 3 March 2018, Jaubert made contact with an Indian journalist in preparation for the end of their journey. The following day, Sheikha Latifa, Jaubert and Jauhiainen, along with the crew of three Philippine nationals, were intercepted by Indian authorities while approaching Goa on the U.S.-registered yacht "Nostromo", call sign WDG9847. An investigation by The Guardian and Bureau of Investigative Journalism later revealed that on the same day, Signalling System No. 7 protocol was exploited in an attempt to locate Jaubert's phone.
On 9 March 2018, the "Daily Mail" broke the news of the disappearance of "Nostromo" and those aboard, after being contacted by Sheikha Latifa's representatives.
She had made a 39-minute video before the escape attempt, to be released in case her life was in danger, and it was made public on 11 March 2018. Recorded at Jauhiainen's apartment, the video explains her family background and the circumstances leading to her decision to flee. In the video, she also accuses her father of maltreatment of her and her sister Shamsa along with other serious charges, including murder.
The Finnish National Bureau of Investigation confirmed the disappearance of Jauhiainen and opened an investigation in collaboration with the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The brother of Jauhiainen confirmed her friendship with Sheikha Latifa.
On 20 March 2018, "Nostromo" was spotted at the port of Fujairah in the UAE. It left the next day for Sri Lanka with the released crew, including Jaubert and three Philippine nationals, on board. "Nostromo" reached Galle, Sri Lanka, on 2 April 2018.
On 22 March 2018, Sheikha Latifa's companion Jauhiainen was found, prompting the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs to terminate its search in cooperation with the Dubai authorities. The location where Jauhiainen was found and details of prior events were not shared officially, but according to her family she returned from Dubai to Finland that night.
According to Detained in Dubai, a number of people were detained or interrogated in connection to the event in UAE and Oman, notably Christian Elombo, a French national whose family is living in Luxembourg; Elombo spent more than a month in custody in Oman, from late February to 5 April 2018. After being released without charge, he was again taken into custody in Luxembourg on 6 April 2018 for 41 days under an Interpol Red Notice issued by the UAE. The notice was later retracted without notification or producing any evidence for the cited kidnapping charges.
Interception of the yacht "Nostromo".
According to the testimonies of the crew, the yacht was being actively searched for by Indian Coast Guard search and rescue aircraft SAR CG 782 on 3 March 2018. On the day of interception the yacht was scouted by another aircraft. Before the raid on 4 March 2018, three marine vessels were spotted on radar by "Nostromo"'s crew, tailing it at a speed of less than 5 knots. Two of the vessels were later identified as ICGS "Shoor" and ICGS "Samarth", described in media statements by Jaubert: "The two coast guards vessels had a huge marking on the side of the hull, which read 'Indian Coast Guard' and one had an ID number painted: 11".
After sunset two unmarked speedboats carrying six to eight armed Indian MARCOS Special Forces personnel in full military gear and Tavor assault rifles were launched from these ships to intercept "Nostromo". The raid began with the use of stun and smoke grenades to disorient and incapacitate the crew, who were then handcuffed. After being taken over by Indian Coast Guard, the yacht was boarded by at least ten Emirati special forces personnel, who arrived by helicopter. Sheikha Latifa, despite claiming asylum to Indian personnel and expressing a clear unwillingness to go back to the UAE from where she was fleeing, was forcefully taken away onto one of the ships. "Nostromo" and the rest of the crew were taken to the naval base in Fujairah, escorted by the Indian Coast Guard and then transferred to UAE warship "Baynunah".
According to Radha Stirling's account, she received her last voice message from Latifa during the alleged raid in a panicked state, telling her "Radha please help me, there are men outside" and that she had heard "gunshots". Further attempts of communication from those on-board "Nostromo" allegedly failed due to jamming from an Indian electronic warfare aircraft.
In total, at least three Indian and two Emirati warships, two military planes, and a helicopter were involved in the raid on "Nostromo", about 50 miles off the coast of Goa.
Media reactions and aftermath.
In the early days after the disappearance of the yacht "Nostromo" and its crew, the news was primarily carried on English and Finnish tabloids, backed up by awareness campaigns in social media. Jauhiainen and Jaubert made their first public appearance after the incident in a press conference arranged by Detained in Dubai in London despite facing alleged threats from the UAE government to stay silent.
Following a period without mention in the Gulf media, the Western media reported in mid-April the first reaction from the UAE, originating from an anonymous source close to the Dubai government. According to that source, Sheikha Latifa had been "brought back", that she was now "with her family", and that she was "doing excellent". The source further claimed the incident had been a "private matter" that had been used to "tarnish the reputation of Dubai and Sheikh Mohammed," and said that three of those who had accompanied Sheikha Latifa were wanted in Dubai on previous charges. In May 2018, Human Rights Watch questioned Dubai's story, and asked Dubai's authorities to reveal her location, adding: "[f]ailure to disclose the whereabouts and status of the princess could qualify as an enforced disappearance". Dubai authorities said that they could not comment on her case due to legal reasons. The UN OHCHR Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearance sought responses on allegations from the Governments of India and UAE.
"Ad-Diyaar", a mainstream Arab newspaper, also published calls by Human Rights Watch raising the issue that Sheikha Latifa had been forcibly hidden. Support groups also raised awareness of the campaign at the 2018 Kentucky Derby by flying a banner saying "DUBAI, WHERE IS PRINCESS LATIFA?".
The UAE-controlled media began reporting extensively about the social activities of her half-sister with the same name, who serves as Vice Chairman of Dubai Culture &amp; Arts Authority (Dubai Culture). Many news outlets reported show jumper Sheikha Latifah bint Ahmed bin Juma Al Maktoum as missing, due to similarity in names.
The Indian government was widely criticised for its extrajudicial outreach, citing national interests and disregard of formal legal process. Indian media reported that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his advisers were directly involved in giving the orders for interception at the request of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum and didn't seek any formal request from UAE. An Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson claimed that "[n]o such incident has been brought to our notice." Deputy Commandant Avinandan Mitra of the Indian Coast Guard, in response to media queries about this incident near the Indian coastline, said that "we have no such information or operation." Indian Intelligence agencies said they were trying to verify the claims but had no further comment. On 2 January 2019, Minister of State for External Affairs V. K. Singh denied any involvement of Indian Government in repatriation of emirati princess while replying to a question raised by member of parliament Saugata Roy.
Similarly, the Finnish government was criticised for not raising concerns about a human rights violation of one of their citizens to Indian authorities. A day later, the Finnish Minister of Foreign Affairs, Timo Soini, responded, saying Finland had been in correspondence with UAE and Indian officials about the issue outside of media.
Amnesty International, on 4 September 2018, released a public statement appealing to the government of UAE to disclose the whereabouts of Sheikha Latifa and uphold its international legal obligations, while also calling upon the Indian government to investigate any role of its security forces and officials involved in the raid on "Nostromo" and unlawful excesses that may have been committed.
On 6 December 2018, the release of the BBC Two documentary "Escape from Dubai: The Mystery of the Missing Princess" elicited the first official response on the matter from the Dubai royal court in the form of a brief statement saying that Latifa was safe at home. The documentary covered the escape attempt that Sheikha Latifa had spent seven years planning and also looking into a similar attempt by her sister Shamsa in 2000. In January 2019, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum's wife, Princess Haya al-Hussein of Jordan, half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan, spoke in defense of Dubai's treatment of Sheikha Latifa. After news reports of Princess Haya's alleged separation with Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, human rights campaigners called on Princess Haya to speak out on her stepdaughter Latifa's fate in Dubai.
The matter was referred to the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions by Guernica 37, a London-based law firm representing Latifa and her two friends. Chairman-rapporteur, Bernard Duhaime of the UN's working group on enforced or involuntary disappearances wrote to Dubai's royal family requesting evidence that Latifa was alive and the grounds on which she was being held captive or else they would have to make a public statement.
In February 2021, a UN investigation determined that the princess was exchanged for British arms dealer Christian Michel, who was extradited from Dubai to Delhi to be tried for paying bribes.
Visit from Mary Robinson.
On 24 December 2018, three low-resolution photographs taken on 15 December 2018, showing Sheikha Latifa alongside Mary Robinson, the former United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, were released by UAE authorities. According to Mary Robinson, the meeting was arranged by one of the wives of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Princess Haya. Robinson described Latifa in a BBC Radio 4 interview as a "troubled young woman" who regretted making the earlier video in which she alleged abuse, and was receiving psychiatric care. The comments were criticised by various rights groups and Detained in Dubai's head Radha Stirling for reciting Dubai's official version of the events "almost verbatim". Human rights groups and associates of Sheikha Latifa questioned the nature of the brief visit, calling for independent investigation and assessment of her situation and disputing suggestions of any psychiatric problems and reiterating the possibility of her being held under captivity. Robinson later told the BBC that she had been "horribly tricked".
David Haigh and Marcus Essabri, Latifa's cousin, commenting on the released photos of Latifa, stated that Sheikha Latifa appears to be forcibly medicated while held in Dubai under orders of her father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
2019 court proceedings.
In December 2019, a UK family court ruled that – on the balance of probabilities – Sheikh Mohammed orchestrated the abductions of Sheikha Latifa and Sheikha Shamsa and subjected Princess Haya to a campaign of "intimidation"; the findings were published in March 2020.
2021 documentary.
Human rights activists were able to covertly re-establish communication with Latifa while she was being held captive in a private villa in Dubai for at least a year after her attempted escape from her family in February 2018. They were able to obtain text and video messages from her during this period. After about a year and half the communication abruptly ended on 21 July 2020 when Latifa stopped responding to messages.
In February 2021, smuggled footage obtained by BBC program "Panorama" showed Sheikha Latifa recounting how she fought back against the soldiers taking her off the boat until she was tranquilized and later carried onto a private jet which landed in Dubai. The United Nations human rights office asked the UAE to present a proof that Princess Latifa is alive. Nearly two months later, on 9April 2021, the organization said that while the Emirates stated that Sheikha Latifa was being cared for by her family, the country failed to provide a "proof of life" for her. On the same occasion, a spokesperson said that the Emirates had in principle agreed to a meeting about Sheikha Latifa between senior United Nations officials and the Emirati ambassador in Geneva. On 21April, independent United Nations advisers said in a statement that they were "alarmed" that the Emirates had not provided any concrete information, and that the statement by the Emirati authorities was not sufficient. The United States response to the statement, which said that freedom from arbitrary detention was a universal human right, was described in the "New York Times" as "muted".
2021 Kentucky Derby complaint.
On 28 April 2021, days before the Kentucky Derby in which Sheikha Latifa's father Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum had a horse named "Essential Quality" who was considered a favorite to win, a group of human rights lawyers and students at the University of Louisville filed a complaint with the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission, asking for the Sheikh and "Essential Quality" to be barred from the Derby on the grounds of Sheikha Latifa's alleged situation. The Racing Commission announced on 29 April that as the complaint had not articulated a violation of its regulations, no sanctions would be put in place.
2021 Dubai Mall photo appearance.
On 22 May 2021, a photo that appears to show Princess Latifa alive has been posted online and shared on two public Instagram accounts. The photo appears to be in a Dubai shopping mall, the Mall of the Emirates, as she is seen sitting with two other women. Although the image has not been verified, a friend of Latifa's confirmed that it is the princess in the picture. According to sources, the women who posted the proof of life of Princess Latifa in the May 2021 pictures of her from a restaurant at a shopping mall were paid to do so. Some human rights activists also asked the UK government to help out.
2021 Madrid–Barajas Airport appearance.
The following month in June 2021, pictures of Latifa at Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport were posted on Instagram by former Royal Navy member Sioned Taylor, who had also published photos showing Latifa in the Mall of the Emirates. She mentioned they were on a "Great European holiday with Latifa". David Haigh, co-founder of the Free Latifa campaign stated that they were "pleased to see Latifa seemingly having a passport, traveling and enjoying an increasing degree of freedom", and confirmed that several campaign members had been contacted directly by the princess herself.
2021 UAE Pegasus surveillance leaks.
In July 2021, leaked data from surveillance firm NSO Group Pegasus spyware revealed the presence of Latifa's among UAE-targeted phone numbers, as well as several of her close friends, as being possible targets. Pegasus spyware allows full access, including GPS, to target phones, and may have helped to track Latifa's escape route.
Mobile device of human rights activist in communication with Latifa was also found to be compromised with Pegasus. Activist had been covertly exchanging videos and text messages with Latifa for about a year and a half while she was being held in captivity after her forced returned to Dubai in February 2018.
2021 end of #FreeLatifa campaign.
In August 2021 and after Latifa had been photographed in public places in Dubai, Spain and Iceland, the #FreeLatifa campaign, which had lasted three and a half year, came to an end. Human rights lawyer David Haigh, Latifa's cousin Marcus Essabri and Sioned Taylor, observing her wellbeing, described her situation as "the best position she has been in, in terms of freedom for two decades". The FreeLatifa campaign stated:Following the meeting between Marcus and Latifa in Iceland it has been decided that the most appropriate step at this time is to close the Free Latifa campaign. The primary purpose of the Free Latifa campaign was to see Latifa free leading the life she chooses for herself. We have clearly gone a long way towards achieving that goal over the last three years, with bodies such as the United Nations now monitoring the current and future wellbeing of Latifa.David Haigh, co-founder of the Free Latifa campaign encouraged caution, saying: "It's quite right and understandable that everyone needs to look at everything that's happening now with extreme caution and monitor the situation closely."
Controversy.
In May 2018, Helene Jaubert, ex-wife of former French Navy officer Hervé Jaubert told "The Daily Beast" that Jaubert and Radha Stirling had been in contact with Latifa for five years, and invented the scheme together: "The whole plan was for Hervé to help her escape and once he got her out the daughter was going to get to the dad and say 'I want $3 million or else I'll tell all to the media'. It was a con. It's a corrupt scheme gone haywire". According to Stirling, Latifa phoned her from the boat in the middle of the ambush, saying she feared for her life and "was hearing gunshots". Latifa made the call via WhatsApp and evidence of the call was provided to authorities in the United States and the United Kingdom and made available to reporters. "The Daily Beast" pointed out that a satellite phone is normally needed to call from their alleged location in the Indian Ocean. However, it was established that the "Nostromo" was outfitted with satellite phone.
In August 2019, Tiina Jauhiainen gave her version of events to online magazine "Insider".
FBI's role in her capture.
According to "USA Today", the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), "responding to an urgent plea from the powerful Dubai leader's office, provided assistance essential to her capture." The FBI declined to comment.

Herbert Weissbach (biochemist)

Dr. Herbert Weissbach (born 16 March 1932) is an American biochemist/molecular biologist.
He was born in the Bronx, New York City, where he spent his childhood. He is one of 3 children, having a younger sister Carol and an older brother Arthur, also a biochemist. He obtained his high school diploma from the Bronx High School of Science and a B.S. degree, majoring in chemistry, from the City College of New York (1953).
Upon graduation, he was recruited by Dr. Sidney Udenfriend to the National Heart Institute of National Institutes of Health (NIH) to enter a new joint graduate program between the NIH and George Washington University. He received his Ph.D. from George Washington University (Thesis: Studies on 5-Hydroxyindole Metabolism, 1957) based on research done at the NIH in the Udenfriend laboratory. In 1958 the NIH supported his postdoctoral studies done with Dr. H.A. Barker at the University of California at Berkeley, where he was involved in the discovery of the coenzyme form of vitamin B12.
In 1959 he returned to the NIH as an independent investigator where he continued his studies on the role of vitamin B12 in methionine biosynthesis, research that helped to elucidate the known inter-relationship among vitamin 12, folic acid and one carbon metabolism. The studies on methionine synthesis led to his collaboration with the Nirenberg laboratory at the NIH shortly after the genetic code was cracked.
By 1967 the Weissbach laboratory was deeply involved in protein synthesis (translation) at which time he accepted a position as Associate Director of the RIMB to help found the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology (RIMB) with Sidney Udenfriend, and in 1983 he became Director of the RIMB and a Vice-President of Research at Hoffmann- La Roche, Nutley, NJ. The RIMB was involved in the very early days of the emergence of the biotechnology industry and was instrumental in helping Hoffmann-La Roche enter this field. Weissbach described this period at Roche in a book he co-authored with David Fisher in 2016 titled “A Camelot of the Biomedical Sciences: The Story of the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology”.
After the RIMB closed, in 1997 he accepted a position as Distinguished Research Professor at Florida Atlantic University (FAU) REFF, where he founded, and was Director, of the Center for Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (CMBB) for 20 years. In 2017 he was appointed Distinguished Research Professor Emeritus at FAU. His most recent research has involved understanding the mechanisms that cells use to protect against oxidative damage, based on the observation that cells have a mechanism to protect against oxidative damage to methionine residues in proteins

He argues, that the rhetoric in preaching is a language skill or art of speaking in the presence of others with a systematic and logical verbal to provide understanding and convince others. Rhetoric is also one of the science devices that support the process of implementation of da'wah, so that rhetoric and da'wah bil-lisan is inseparable.

In connection with the professionalism of a da'i, he explained that professional da'i is a da'i who has knowledge and broad insight in the field of da'wah, and know the duty to function as a preacher.

"Hands" has been described as one "Ireland’s favourite" television programs, and has been rebroadcast several times to the extent that it is one of the "most broadcast" RTÉ productions.
Harvey O'Brien, in his "The Real Ireland: The Evolution of Ireland in Documentary Film" (2004), said "The series was marked by its close-up observation of the techniques involved, and though lacking an explicit social commentary always gave the sense that these skills were gradually disappearing.".
For over 20 years, the original film sat in tea chests in a barn in Creagh, County Mayo. In March 2013 archivists packed all 1,800 film cans into storage containers and brought them to the RTÉ Archives.

Apache Celix is an open-source implementation of the OSGi specification adapted to C and C++ developed by the Apache Software Foundation. The project aims to provide a framework to develop (dynamic) modular software applications using component and/or service-oriented programming.
Apache Celix is primarily developed in C and adds an additional abstraction, in the form of a library, to support for C++.
Modularity in Apache Celix is achieved by supporting - run-time installed - bundles. Bundles are zip files and can contain software modules in the form of shared libraries. Modules can provide and request dynamic services, for and from other modules, by interacting with a provided bundle context. Services in Apache Celix are "plain old" structs with function pointers or "plain old C++ Objects" (POCO).
History.
Apache Celix was welcomed in the Apache Incubator at November 2010 and graduated to Top Level Project from the Apache Incubator in July 2014.

Jovica Milijić

Jovica Milijić (; born 20 January 1986) is a Serbian-born Maltese futsal player, currently playing for Valletta, the reigning champions of Maltese Futsal League. In 2017 he won the Malta Football Association's futsal player of the year.
Football career.
Milijić made his first football steps with Timočanin in mid-1990s, becoming a member of the promising generation together with the brothers Marinković, Nebojša Marinković and Nenad Marinković.
Soon after family relocation to Malta in 1999, he joined Pietà Hotspurs, a Maltese club famous for producing talented footballers in its youth school.
Futsal career.
European Pilot Academy.
The first touch with futsal Milijić had in the jersey of European Pilot Academy's futsal club (formerly known as Serbia) where he won his first trophy - Maltese Futsal Cup for the season 2006/07. Also, Milijić was close to win his first championship as that season European Pilot Academy was a point behind the title winner Jeepers Handyman Centre.
Aluserv Futsal Club.
After a successful debutant season, Milijić joined newly promoted futsl top tier Aluserv. The team that were made for an instant success won the league and cup but were defeated in the play-off semi-final, just like in the season 2008–09.
Scandals.
His UEFA competition debut was at 2008–09 UEFA Futsal Cup preliminary round against Slovenian 2008 champion Gorica on 23 August 2008. The match was played in Helsinki and Scandals were heavy defeated (0-11).
Paola Downtowns.
During his stay in Paola Downtowns, Milijić was named for the top scorer of 2010-11 Maltese Futsal First Division with 42 goals. The same season he was nominated for the best futsal player but the award went in the hands of the Romanian Anton Florin.
Lija Athletics.
Before the start of the 2012/13 season, Lija Athletic replaced Naxxar Motors and Milijić became a captain of the newly formed club. He even scored a hattrick on his debut against Valletta (7-1). Although Lija Athletic had the highest ambitions, the cup journey was ended yet in the quarter-final and play-off was missed, for the first time in Milijić's career.
Balzan.
Next season Milijić changed Lija Athletics for Balzan and the first trophy came soon after. Hibernians was heavily defeated (5-1) with Milijić among the scorers. That was the introduction in a very successful season where Balzan won all possible trophies.
Valletta.
Milijić joined Valletta FC Futsal in June 2015 as an experienced player that has won every possible honor.
 He was a key figure in Valletta's march to the national title. His best game in the regular part of the season was in March in a derby against his ex-club Lija Athletic, when he scored four goals in a 7–4 win. During the first season with Valletta he scored 18 goals in the Gatorade Futsal League.
Next season Milijić added 21 goals.
Malta national futsal team.
In 2012 Milijić became a naturalized Maltese citizen and soon after started playing for the national futsal team. He had a debut in a heavy defeat against Georgia (0-9) in UEFA Futsal Euro 2014 qualifying at home ground in Paola, Malta on January 23, 2013. He was also in the starting line up against Moldova recording one more loss (1-4).
In 2014 Malta played only friendly games, three of them against Gibraltar (3-4, 4-2 and 1-0) and Serbia (1-4), Milijić participated in all of them scoring two goals and a few more times he was close to score hitting only the post, most notably against his homeland Serbia.
Next year Malta participated in the qualification for Euro 2016 and then the qualification for World Cup. The team lost all six games, three in each tournament, by the order: England (0-3), Andorra (0-4), Latvia (0-8), then France (2-8), Lithuania (1-2) and Albania (3-6). Milijić took a part in all matches and scored in the last two.
Between two tournaments, Malta went to San Marino and recorded two wins (5-1 and 5-3) with Milijić in the squad. He earned two more caps next year against the same national team, this time in Paola (4-0 and 2-2).
At the beginning of the last year, with Milijić in the starting five, Malta lost all three games in UEFA Futsal Euro 2018 qualifying tournament held in Bulgaria, against England (1-6), Bulgaria (1-6) and Albania (2-3).
Since his debut five years ago, Milijić has not missed any national team match, recording 19 caps and 4 goals in total.

Busari Adelakun

Busari Adelakun was a Nigerian politician from Ejioku area of Ibadan, Oyo State. He was affiliated with the Action Group and Unity Party of Nigeria (UPN) during the First and Second Republic respectively. As a member of UPN and a later NPN in Ibadan during the second republic, Adelakun was an important figure in the turbulent politics of the city.
Adelakun's father was a cocoa farmer from Ibadan and he inherited his father's farm upon the death of the latter. When he began his first political activities, it was to represent his father during meetings of the Ibadan Peoples Party. From there Adelakun joined the Action Group, it was an arduous task for the party to gain support in Ibadan due to the popularity of a single man, Adegoke Adelabu, even after Adelabu's death AG did not gain much support in Ibadan and violence that sprung out after the death of Adelabu targeted many of the party's members. A schism in AG between the regional Premier, Akintola and former premier, Awolowo emerged in 1962. Adelakun sided the Awolowo faction. Thereafter, Adelakun's faction was weakened in Ibadan during a chaotic period in the Western region. After a military coup dissolved the democratic republic, Adelakun returned to farming and also joined a farmer's union, becoming its president.
In 1976, he won the local government elections in Ibadan after a few setbacks which included an initial disqualification. After he was initially disqualified from contesting the election, Adelakun's supporters boycotted the election, while he went to court to declare the election null and void. The court accepted his plea and after the new election was conducted, Adelakun was declared winner. In 1979, Adelakun teamed up with another party leader, Archdeacon Emmanuel Alayande to help UPN clinch majority of votes in Ibadan, it was one of the few times an Awolowo led party was able to win majority votes in the city. In 1979, he was appointed commissioner of local government in Oyo State, two years after, he was redeployed to the Health ministry.
In 1983, Adelakun joined a faction that was opposed to the candidacy of Bola Ige as UPN governor. Adelakun and another member of the faction, Sunday Afolabi later joined the opposition party, NPN
Adelakun was jailed in 1984 by a new military regine headed by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari. He died at Lagos University Teaching Hospital as a result of ill health while still being imprisoned .

The Runaway (short story)

"The Runaway" () is an 1887 short story by Anton Chekhov. 
Background and publication history.
The story was based on real life incidents Chekhov witnessed when working at the Chikino regional hospital as a young doctor, according to Mikhail Chekhov, which was later corroborated by his sister Maria It was first published on 28 September 1887 by "Peterburgskaya Gazeta" (issue No. 266), in the Fleeting Notes (Летучие заметки) section, signed A. Chekhonte (А. Чехонте). In a slightly revised version it was reproduced in the illustrated almanac "Stoglav" in 1889, in Saint Petersburg. It was also included in the collection "Detvora" (Детвора, Children, St Petersburg, 1889). 
Chekhov included it into volume two of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899-1901. During its author's lifetime, the story was translated into Danish, Serbo-Croatian, German, French and Czech languages. In 1893 Y. Tveroyanskaya informed Chekhov, writing from Paris, that her translations of "Gusev" and "The Runaway" were published by "Revue des deux Mondes" to much public and critical acclaim. 
Plot summary.
Pashka (full name Pavel Galaktionov), a peasant boy of seven, who has seen, apparently, little of the world, is taken to a local hospital by his mother, with a sore elbow. The doctor initially seems to him a grim and dangerous man, whose wont is to chide people around him, including his own mother, who'd been neglecting her son's trouble for half a year, until the infection has spread into an elbow joint, so that the arm now was in danger of amputation. The doctor decides that Pashka needs an operation, and suggests that he stays hospital. 
The boy finds the hospital a rich ground for investigation, full of surprises. First he is served a gorgeous dinner, the likes of which he'd never seen in his life. Then he ventures into his surroundings and discovers a host of very strange people in the neighboring wards, each of whom is apparently ill, but in their own, peculiar way. One man, Mikhaylo, lies with a bag of ice on his head, without moving. Overwhelmed by his impressions, Pashka dozes off.
The boy is awaken by a noise and leaves his bed. He sees three figures in the corridor trying to drag somebody through next ward's door, and recognizes the dead body as that of Mikhaylo. Horrified, he rushes out of the hospital in panic. He runs around in the dark, finally falls unconscious at the porch… When he comes to, it is broad daylight. He is inside, and the doctor's voice reproaches him for his silliness.
Reception.
"The Runaway" was one of Lev Tolstoy's favourite stories. "Father greatly enjoyed a little story by Chekhov in the "Stoglav" almanac and he read it aloud more than once," Tatyana Tolstaya informed her brother Sergey in the 6 February 1889 letter. Later Tolstoy recited it for his guests and family at least twice, in September 1907 and October 1909. "It is such a pleasure to read it. Occasionally, when it is poignant or funny, I get excited," he told his friend, the Slovak doctor Dushan Makovitsky. Tolstoy included the story (along with "The Darling") into his compilation "The Select Reading".

Metallyticus fallax

Metallyticus fallax is a species of praying mantis found in Southeast Asia. It has an iridescent appearance. It is very similar to "Metallyticus splendidus".
Biology and Ecology.
"Metallyticus fallax" has several pleisomorphic morphological traits, such as its short prothorax and lack of discoidal spines. It has more ventral cervical sclerites than "Metallyticus splendidus".
This mantis tends to rest underneath the bark of trees, feeding on butterflies, termites, flies, and mainly on cockroaches. They also chase after their prey, rather than ambushing them like most mantis species.

Cathleen M. Crudden is a Canadian chemist. She is a Canada Research Chair in Metal Organic Chemistry at Queen's University at Kingston. In February 2021, she took up the role of Editor-in-chief at ACS Catalysis.
Education.
Crudden earned a Bachelors of Science at the University of Toronto in 1989, working with Mark Lautens, with whom she went on to complete her master's degree. She moved to University of Ottawa for her PhD, working under the supervision of Howard Alper, which she completed in 1995.
Research and career.
Crudden was appointed a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council postdoctoral fellow at University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign working with Scott E. Denmark in 1995. She moved to University of New Brunswick in 1996 where she started her own research group. In 2002, she was appointed a Queen's National Scholar and moved her research lab to Kingston, Ontario.
Crudden was the first to identify an enantiospecific Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reaction of chiral boranes. In 2014 she designed more stable nitrogen-based self-assembled monolayer treatments for metal surfaces. The N-heterocyclic carbene self-assembled monolayers can be used in a range of applications, including biosensors. Her interests lie in hydroboration, organometallic chemistry, chiral materials and persistent carbenes. In 2010 Crudden became head of a Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council CREATE award in chiral materials, worth $1.6 million. She became President of the Canadian Society of Chemistry.
In 2015 she, as Principal Investigator of a group of ten collaborators, was awarded $8.8 million from the Canada Foundation for Innovation for major infrastructure purchases. She won the Queen's University Research Opportunities Fund, which she used to create inexpensive, sensitive biosensors. Her group prepares carbon-based ligands for metal surfaces, which can be used as sensing systems based on surface plasmon resonance. In 2016, she and Dr. Suning Wang held a trilateral Canada-Japan-Germany symposium at Queen's looking at "Elements Functions for Transformative Catalysis and Materials". Crudden is a joint Professor at the Institute of Transformative Bio-Molecules, based out of Nagoya University in Japan, where she runs a satellite lab. She is one of only four international collaborators at this Institute. She was recognised as having made the most distinguished contribution to the field of catalysis by the Chemical Institute of Canada in 2018, when they awarded her the Catalysis Award. Crudden also often comments on developments in the field of organic chemistry in various media outlets.

School of Information Sciences, Wayne State University

The Wayne State University School of Information Sciences (SIS) is a school of information science at Wayne State University in Detroit. Prior to August 2017, the school was known as the School of Library and Information Science. The school has been accredited by the American Library Association since 1967 and offers programs leading to master's degrees in both library and information science and the science of information management. In 2017, the school was ranked 22nd by the U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking among library and information science studies programs.
History.
The school dates to 1918 when the Detroit Normal Training School, as Wayne was then known, began offering librarianship classes. In the 1930s, the school's teacher training program began issuing bachelor's degrees with a minor in library science.
In 1967, Wayne's library and information science program, then part of Wayne's College of Education, was accredited by the American Library Association to grant master's degrees in library and information science.
In 1993, Wayne's library and information science program gained independence as the Library and Information Science Program. Robert Holley served as the director of the program from approximately 1993 to 1998. He was preceded by Patricia Senn Breivik and succeeded by Joseph J. Mika.
In 1997, Wayne opened a new 300,000-square foot undergraduate library, built at a cost of $37-million.
The program became the School of Library and Information Science in 2009. In August 2017, the school changed its name to the School of Information Sciences.
Sandra Yee was the school's dean from 2001 until her retirement in July 2017. In 2004, Yee spoke in opposition to the Patriot Act, arguing that it "could have a chilling effect on research and intellectual freedom, which are critical to our nation’s freedom."
Jon Cawthorn was appointed as dean of the school effective August 1, 2017. Cawthorn was previously the dean of libraries at West Virginia University.
Enrollment and programs.
The school has an enrollment of 426 students in its graduate degrees and certificates programs. Two master's degrees, two joint degrees and four graduate certificates are offered. The Master of Library and Information Science (MLIS) program has three areas of study - library services, archives and digital content management; and information management. The Master of Science in Information Management has five specializations - software tools, web-based information services, data analytics, health and scientific data management and user experience. Graduate certificates include archival administration, information management, library and information science, and public services to children and young adults.
Rankings.
In the 2017 edition of the U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking, Wayne State's School of Information Sciences was ranked No. 22 out of 62 accredited library and information science programs.

Helen Mary Wilson (physician)

Dr. Helen Mary Wilson (1864–1951) was a physician and social purity campaigner.
Wilson was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire and moved to Sheffield early in her childhood. She studied medicine at the London School of Medicine for Women. 
In 1892 Wilson was House surgeon at the London Temperance Hospital. She worked in private practice in Sheffield from 1893 until 1906, when she retired to become actively involved in the Association for Moral and Social Hygiene, previously known as the Ladies' National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts. She took a humane approach to women in and in danger of falling into prostitution, rather than punitive one, and argued against double standards in the law on prostitution. From 1916-1919 she was Chair of the Women's Training Colony in Newbury, Berkshire, a work camp that aimed to provide responsibility, independence and occupation.
Wilson had an interest in women's suffrage, serving as honorary secretary of the Sheffield Women's Suffrage Society in 1909–1910 and also as President. In 1920 she was appointed magistrate in Sheffield, the first woman to hold the role in Sheffield. Wilson died in 1951, in London.
Archives.
Archival materials relating to Wilson are held at The Women's Library at the London School of Economics, including a scrapbook of Dr Wilson's containing ephemera relating to the suffrage campaigns in Sheffield and the Sheffield Women's Suffrage Society.

Reuben Slonim

Reuben Slonim (1914-January 20, 2000) was a Canadian rabbi and journalist.
Early life.
Slonim was born in Winnipeg. After his immigrant father suffered a stroke, Slonim's mother was left to tend to her husband and three children. She and her children boarded at Jewish Orphanage and Children's Aid of Western Canada, where she was the cook. In his memoir Grand to Be an Orphan, Slonim recalled that while the Orphanage offered educational opportunities, some of the staff also dished out beatings.
Education.
With Orphanage support, Slonim studied at a yeshivah in Chicago and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology, where he received his B.S.A.S. in 1933. He then attended the Jewish Theological Seminary, where he was ordained and earned an M.H.L. in 1937. He also attended the Albany Law School, New York, between 1935 and 1937.
Community activism.
Slonim held a variety of community positions, including president of the Toronto Zionist Council (1947–52) and chair of the Synagogue Council State of Israel Bonds (1955–60). Slonim grew angry, however, over the policies of the State of Israel and what he perceived as the uncritical support of Israel within the Jewish community.
Journalism.
In 1955 The Toronto Telegram hired Slonim as associate editor on the Middle East. Until the newspaper's demise in 1971 and later in the Jewish Standard, Slonim often attacked Orthodox influence on Israeli politics and Israel's treatment of Palestinians. He also championed Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories and strongly opposed the 1982 Lebanon war.
Rabbi.
In 1937 he became rabbi at Toronto's McCaul Street Synagogue, one of the first Canadian-born rabbis to serve a Conservative congregation, and he remained there for three years. For the next seven years he occupied pulpits in Cleveland and Troy (n.y.) before returning to Toronto in 1947 to serve the McCaul Street Synagogue until its 1955 merger with the University Avenue Synagogue. He was not named to the senior position in the newly established Beth Tzedec Congregation.In 1960, Slonim was hired by a small and unaffiliated liberal Toronto congregation, Congregation Habonim Toronto, established in the spirit of German Liberal Judaism, by central European Holocaust survivors. Slonim attracted younger, Canadian-born congregants but, to the consternation of some, he also used his pulpit to condemn Israeli policy. After the war in Lebanon, he was dismissed. He described his time as a pulpit rabbi in To Kill a Rabbi (1987). Slonim never at any time expressed anger at the Jewish community where his views were unpopular. He subsequently co-founded the Association for the Living Jewish Spirit, which until 1999 met on High Holidays.
Later life.
Towards the end of his life, Slonim received belated recognition from the Jewish community. Rabbi Gunther Plaut, who had often been at loggerheads with Slonim, later admitted that Slonim was unjustly ostracized by the Jewish community and regretted his own part in the process. In 1998, the Jewish Theological Seminary honored Slonim for his years of service. Slonim died January 20, 2000, at his home, a victim of a stroke and Alzheimer’s disease. He was 85. He had been in ill health for the past year, according to his daughter, Rena Tsur. His wife, Reta, predeceased him by six years.
Other writing.
In addition to his two memoirs, Slonim published In the Steps of Pope Paul (1965), an account of Pope Paul's visit to the Middle East; Both Sides Now (1972) summarizing his career at the Toronto Telegram, and Family Quarrel: The United Church and the Jews (1977) chronicling disputes over Israel between the Jewish community and the United Church.

Damen Stan 5009 patrol vessel

Damen Group, a Dutch shipbuilding firm, has a record for designing a range of patrol vessels, the Damen Stan patrol vessels, that includes the Damen Stan 5009 patrol vessel. Vessels built to the 5009 design are 50 metres long and nine metres wide.
The design is unusual, in having a vertical leading edge to the hull, which Damen calls an "axe bow" - a feature Damen describes as improving habitability in high seas. Vessel of this design have maximum speeds in the 25-35 knot range, and can accommodate crews of approximately 20 to 30 individuals.
Operators of the vessels include the Cape Verde Coast Guard (2011), the Ecuadorian Coastguard (2012), South Africa (2015), Trinidad and Tobago (2016), Somali Police Force (2016), and the Jamaica Defence Force Coast Guard (2020).
Damen offers a design for similar vessels intended to be fast crew transport vessels for off-shore drilling platforms.

John A. Kenney Sr.

John Andrew Kenney Sr. (June 11, 1874January 29, 1950) was an African-American surgeon who was the medical director and chief surgeon of the John A. Andrew Memorial Hospital at the Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama, from 1902 to 1922. He served as secretary of the National Medical Association (NMA) from 1904 to 1912, and was elected president of the NMA in 1912. He was the editor-in-chief of its journal, the "Journal of the National Medical Association", from 1916 to 1948. He also served as the personal physician of both Booker T. Washington and George Washington Carver.
After leaving Tuskegee in 1924, he founded the Kenney Memorial Hospital in Newark, New Jersey. Between 1927 and 1934, Kenney Memorial served 4,543 bed patients, 584 free clinic patients and performed 1,109 operations with only 19 deaths. This hospital was renamed the Booker T. Washington Community Hospital in 1935, and closed in 1953. The building is now the New Salem Baptist Church, and is on the National Register of Historic Places. The site intends to establish a museum honoring Kenney. 
In 1939, Kenney returned to Tuskegee to head the Tuskegee Institute Hospital. In 1944, Kenney moved back to Montclair, New Jersey and saw patients at his home, alongside his son John A. Kenney Jr. The Kenneys were a medical family: sons John A. Jr. and Howard were doctors, and daughter Elizabeth Kenney Quisenberry worked with Dr. M.O. Bousfield, who became president of the National Medical Association. Middle son Oscar Kenney was a Tuskegee Airmen killed in action in World War II. Kenney's wife Frieda Kenney was the first African-American woman to graduate from Boston University.

Evolution of cognition

Evolution of cognition is the idea that life on earth has gone from organisms with little to no cognitive function to a greatly varying display of cognitive function that we see in organisms today. Animal cognition is largely studied by observing behavior, which makes studying extinct species difficult. The definition of cognition varies by discipline; psychologists tend define cognition by human behaviors, while ethologists have widely varying definitions. Ethological definitions of cognition range from only considering cognition in animals to be behaviors exhibited in humans, while others consider anything action involving a nervous system to be cognitive.
Methods of study.
Studying the evolution of cognition is accomplished through a comparative cognitive approach where a cognitive ability and comparing it between closely related species and distantly related species. For example, a researcher may want to analyze the connection between spatial memory and food caching behavior. By examining two closely related animals (chickadees and jays) and/or two distantly related animals (jays and chipmunks), hypotheses could be generated about when and how this cognitive ability evolved.
Animals with high levels of cognition.
Higher cognitive processes have evolved in many closely and distantly related animals. Some of these examples are considered convergent evolution, while others most likely shared a common ancestor that possessed higher cognitive function. For example, apes humans, and cetaceans most likely had a common ancestor with high levels of cognition, and as these species diverged they all possessed this trait. Corvids (the crow family) and apes show similar cognitive abilities in some areas such as tool use. This ability is most likely an example of convergent evolution, due to their distant relatedness.
Selection favoring cognition.
Social living.
Social living is thought to have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. It is hypothesized that higher cognitive function evolved to mitigate the negative effects of living in social groups. For example, the ability to recognize individual groups members could solve the problem of cheating behavior. If individuals within the group can keep track of the cheaters, then they can punish or exclude them from the group. There is also a positive correlation between relative brain size and aspects of sociality in some species There are many benefits to living in social groups such as division of labor and protection, but in order to reap these benefits the animals tend to possess high levels of cognition.
Sex, mating, and relationships.
Many animals have complex mating rituals require higher levels of cognition to evaluate. Birds are well known for their intense mating displays including swan dances that can last hours or even days.
Higher levels of cognition may have evolved to facilitate the formation of longer lasting relationships. Animals that form pair bonds and share parental responsibilities produce offspring that are more likely to survive and reproduce, which increases the fitness of these individuals. The cognitive requirements for this type of mating include the ability the differentiate individuals from their group and resolve social conflicts.
Finding, extracting, and protecting food.
Another hypothesis for the evolution of cognition is that cognition allowed individuals access to food and resources that were previously unavailable. For example, the genetic mutation for color vision allowed for a greatly increased efficiency in finding and foraging fruit. Food caching behavior displayed in some birds and mammals is an example of a behavior that may have co-evolved with higher cognitive processes. This ability to store food for later consumption allows these animals to take advantage of temporary surpluses in food availability. Corvids have displayed incredible abilities to create and remember the locations of up to hundreds of caches. In addition, there is evidence that this is not just an instinctual behavior, but an example of future planning. Jays have been found to diversify the types of food they cache, possible indicating they understand the need to eat a variety of food. Some supporters of this hypothesis suggest that higher cognitive processes require a large brain to body ratio. This higher brain to body size ratio in turn requires a large metabolic input to function. The idea is that the two processes (greater access to food and the brain's growing need for energy) may have snowballed the evolution of these two features.
Technology, tools, innovation, and culture.
The cognitive ability to use tools and pass information from one generation to the next is thought to have been a driving force of the evolution of cognition. Many animals use tools including: primates, elephants, cetaceans, birds, fish, and some invertebrates. Tool use varies widely depending on the species. For example, sea otters have been observed using a rock to break open snail shells, while primates and New Caledonian crows have demonstrated an ability to fashion a new tool for a specific use. The ability to use tools seems to provide animals with a fitness advantage, usually in the form of access to food previously unavailable, which allows a competitive advantage for these individuals.
Some animals have demonstrated the ability to pass information from one generation to the next (culture) including: primates, cetaceans, and birds. Primates and birds can pass information of specific tool use strategies on to their offspring who can, in turn, pass it on to their offspring. In this way, the information can remain in a group on individuals even after the original users are gone. One famous example of this is in a group of macaque monkeys in Japan. Researchers studying this species observed these monkeys feeding behavior in a population in Japan. The researchers witnessed one female, named Imo, realize that by washing potatoes in the nearby river you could remove much more sand and dirt then by simply wiping it off. Over the next few generations the researcher saw this behavior begin to appear in other individuals throughout the group.

Agelanthus rondensis is a species of hemiparasitic plant in the family Loranthaceae. It is endemic to Tanzania.
This species has been found only on the Rondo plateau in Tanzania where the threat is from conversion of habitat for agriculture. 
There is a continuing decline in the extent and quality of habitat. This species has not been seen since its discovery in 1903 in what is a well-surveyed region. Thus, it is possibly extinct.
No information is available on habitat or host preference.

Sabana Grande, Caracas

The Sabana Grande district is divided into several middle class neighborhoods located in the Parroquia El Recreo of the Libertador Municipality, in the geographical center of the Metropolitan District of Caracas and owes its name to the old town of Sabana Grande.
History of Sabana Grande.
Foundation and early years.
Originally, the area where today stands the commercial and financial sector Sabana Grande, was an agricultural town in which there were some coffee plantations, such as Hacienda Ibarra, which extended to the Central University of Venezuela and part of the neighborhoods Colinas de Bello Monte and Las Mercedes. At first, the town of Sabana Grande was connected to the agricultural community of Chacao. Hacienda Ibarra was expropriated during the government of Isaías Medina Angarita to modernize the city and part of the previous house is still conserved in the campus of the Central University of Venezuela. The main house of this hacienda was located in Bello Monte of the financial district Sabana Grande, and this house no longer exists. The town of Sabana Grande was the communication route between Caracas to the large plantations (haciendas) located on the outskirts of the city.
Although PDVSA La Estancia has done a research, they have no consensus on the date of foundation of Parroquia El Recreo. Some say that around 1852, the area was elevated to a foreign parish by the Caracas authorities, which served to overcome its status as a hamlet, given the significant number of inhabitants and buildings. Others say that, Parroquia El Recreo was created on November 22, 1864 and not in 1852. According to the historian Manuel Landaeta Rosales (1847-1920), El Recreo was founded on November 22, 1952 as a civil parish. Later, on February 22, 1964, it was founded as an ecclesiastical parish.
On November 4, 1870, the area was integrated into the city of Caracas by the Caracas authorities in the government of Antonio Guzmán Blanco and was named "The Immaculate Conception and San Jose del Recreo" by the presbyter Jose Botel Peraza. Over time, Sabana Grande became a popular summer destination for college students and that's why the area was known as "El Recreo". Sabana Grande was definitively separated from Chacao when it was annexed as the eastern parish of Caracas.
19th century.
Towards the end of the 19th century, the Hippodrome of Sabana Grande (Las Delicias area), run by the Jockey Club of Caracas, operated in the area, and its executives included the prominent artist Arturo Michelena. This hippodrome was the first in Caracas and worked in the area until 1906 when the racecourse was moved to El Paraíso neighborhood.
This important commercial district of Caracas also had the first two commercial centers of Caracas: The East Shopping Center (on Casanova Avenue) and The Gran Avenida, formerly known as Fifth Avenue Shopping Center. The first one is still open on "Avenida Casanova" and the second one was located at the exit of the Metro Plaza Venezuela, where the bus stop to San Antonio de Los Altos is located. The East Sabana Grande Shopping Center was built by the architect Diego Carbonell, with a ring of shops around a central parking lot separate from the street, which meant that some stores had double access.
Caracas Metro.
In the eighties, the construction of Sabana Grande station of Caracas Metro brought more people to the financial district of Sabana Grande. Since then, Sabana Grande became a place of mass recreation. The financial district of Sabana Grande has three metro stations: Plaza Venezuela, Sabana Grande and Chacaíto. This district is the best covered by the Caracas Metro. The boulevard of Sabana Grande was built from the surroundings of "La Previsora Tower" to the Plaza Brión de Chacaíto. The Plaza Brión de Chacaíto was built according to the commercial and financial district of Sabana Grande, despite belonging to Chacao Municipality today. As a result of the problems of authority between the Caracas Metro and the Libertador Municipality, the Sabana Grande district lost maintenance and surveillance in the 1990s. In 1994, the Caracas Metro finally granted the administration of the Boulevard of Sabana Grande to the Libertador Municipality of Caracas.

Italy competed at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics in Paris, France from 6 to 14 August 2005. The nation sent a delegation of 49 athletes (27 men and 22 women) and won one medal at the competition. Alex Schwazer was the bronze medallist in the men's 50 kilometres race walk and he achieved a national record of 3:41:54 hours in the process. It was an unexpected medal, as Schwazer knocked nearly twenty minutes off his previous best that year. Among other Italian performances, three athletes finished fifth in field event finals: Nicola Ciotti (men's high jump), Giuseppe Gibilisco (men's pole vault) and Zahra Bani (women's javelin throw). Excluding the straight finals in the marathon and walks, six Italians reached the final of their track and field event.
This was Italy's worst performance on the medal table at the World Championships at that point and presaged the outcome of no medals at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics.

History.
As early as the 1920s, Chicago has had gay neighborhoods and nightlife. As the rent increased, gay friendly neighborhoods were pushed up to Northern Chicago and into Boys Town, a well known gay neighborhood. In the 1960s, there were more politically active LGBTQ people who worked with the civil rights movement and had help from Chicago Gay Liberation. The state of Illinois became the first to repeal their sodomy law in 1961. In the 1980s, the LGBTQ Democrats were the main political party being involved in Chicago.
National Youth Pride services was founded in Chicago in 2003. As of July 2012, they had around 1,400 LGBT members ages 13 to 25.

Molasky Corporate Center

Molasky Corporate Center is a 17-story office and retail building in downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. The building was developed by Irwin Molasky's company, The Molasky Group. Construction began in 2005, and the building was topped off in July 2006, before opening in August 2007. The Molasky Corporate Center is a green building designed with energy efficient features which earned it a Gold certification from the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). The Southern Nevada Water Authority is a major tenant in the building, and owns five of the building's office floors.
History.
In December 2004, developer Irwin Molasky was planning a $75 million office building in downtown Las Vegas through his company, The Molasky Group. The project, known as Parkway Center, would be located on property at the intersection of Grand Central Parkway and F Street (later renamed City Parkway), directly south of Highway 95 and Interstate 15. The vacant property was worth $2 million, and the city gave Molasky the land on the condition that he use it for the construction of extensive office space to generate substantial property taxes for the city. The 14 ½-story building would include a 6 ½-story parking garage topped by eight floors of office space. The project, designed by Howard F. Thompson &amp; Associates, would include of office space.
Later in December 2004, the Southern Nevada Water Authority (SNWA) approved plans to lease at least five floors of office space in the building, totaling , with the option to lease further space in the future. SNWA would be the first major tenant in the new building, which would become SNWA's new headquarters. Molasky's company would be headquartered on the top floor, and discussions were underway with other tenants interested in leasing the remaining office space not used by SNWA, which signed a 20-year, $63.3 million lease for seven floors in the new building, totaling . The lease included the option for SNWA to purchase the entire building at the end of its lease. Parkway Center was expected to open in 2007, and would be one of the largest office buildings in Las Vegas. The building was expected to generate $500,000 annually in property taxes for the city.
In February 2005, The Molasky Group sold its 17-story Bank of America Plaza building in downtown Las Vegas for $72 million, which the company planned to use to finance other projects, including Parkway Center. Construction began in 2005, with Marnell Corrao as the general contractor. By April 2006, the project was known as the Molasky Corporate Center, with 16 stories planned. The building was topped off in July 2006. By October 2006, the 1,400-space parking garage was nearly complete. The Class A office building was 80 percent pre-leased up to that point. Notable tenants, in addition to SNWA, included the Las Vegas Valley Water District, Bank of Nevada, a Jason's Deli restaurant, and a 24 Hour Fitness gym. Construction was nearing completion in March 2007, by which point two major law firms had signed on as tenants: Ballard Spahr Andrews &amp; Ingersoll; and Brownstein, Hyatt, Farber, Schreck.
The building opened in August 2007, when the first SNWA employees began working in it. It was the first new office tower in downtown Las Vegas in nearly 40 years and it helped to revitalize the area. It is also the only building by Irwin Molasky to feature his name. The building, located at 100 City Parkway, was built at a cost of $107 million.
In December 2007, SNWA approved plans to purchase five of the seven floors that it leased in the building, at a sale price of $34.6 million. SNWA had the option to gradually purchase remaining parts of the building over the next 15 years. In May 2012, SNWA approved a lease for its first tenant in of its unused office space, which would be occupied by a firm specializing in public relations and government affairs. SNWA had an additional of vacant space on its five floors. As of April 2015, the Molasky Corporate Center was the only Class A office building in the Las Vegas Valley with zero vacancy.
Architecture.
The Molasky Corporate Center is a 17-story green building and was designed with energy efficient features. Upon opening, it was Las Vegas' only Class A green office tower. The building includes of space, including of office space. The building is made of glass and steel, qualifying it as Class A office space. The building includes energy efficient glass solar panels that create electricity for the building, and air vents are situated on the floor instead of the ceiling, providing cleaner air to people inside. Chilled water used for the air conditioner is recaptured and used for the building's landscaping. The building's insulation consists of shredded, recycled blue jeans. The building was constructed with 97 percent recycled steel, and countertops in the building's retail area were made with 95 percent recycled steel and crushed glass. The building's office space includes special tiles that have computer and electrical outlets which can be moved around with ease. Much of the interior is lit by sunlight. At night, the building is lit with green accent lighting and a yellow crown.
Initially, Molasky sought a Silver Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification for the building from the U.S. Green Building Council. Ultimately, the building received a Gold certification instead. As of 2007, the building was among approximately 200 in the world to receive the Gold certification. It was the first green office building in Las Vegas to receive a Gold rating. Between $5 million and $7 million was spent on the building to bring it up to Gold LEED standards, and as of 2007, the cost was not expected to be redeemed for 12 to 15 years. The building uses 35 percent less water and 37 percent less electricity in comparison to a similarly sized, non-LEED certified structure.
In December 2007, footage of the building was filmed for a six-part PBS documentary about green buildings in Nevada. The building helped Nevada become the top U.S. state in 2011 for the construction of green buildings. In May 2014, judges for the Building Owners and Managers Association awarded the building The Outstanding Building of the Year (TOBY) Award, praising the building's environmental design features and writing that the building "is impressive" and "leaves no doubt to its quality. The staff is well-seasoned and experienced."

Treehouse of Horror XXIX

"Treehouse of Horror XXIX" is the 643rd episode of the American animated television series "The Simpsons", the fourth episode of season 30 and the twenty-ninth "Treehouse of Horror" episode. It was released on October 21, 2018.
Plot.
Opening sequence.
The episode starts in Fogburyport, birthplace of Green Clam Chowder. The Simpson family arrive there because a book stated it's a place to visit before they mysteriously disappear.
However, it was revealed to be a trap and that they will be devoured by Cthulhu. However, Homer states that he was promised an oyster eating contest against Cthulhu, and Homer beats him. Cthulhu pukes and asks what Homer wants as a reward. Homer whispers "I want to eat you."
Cthulhu is seen in a giant cooking pot and the Simpsons (except Lisa) enjoy a hot dog made of Cthulhu's tentacles.
Intrusion of the Pod-y Switchers.
The segment begins at the underwater base of Mapple, where Steve Mobbs (on a screen) tells about the new Myphone and the new unfunny version of himself to an excited audience. When everyone is on their phone, the unfunny Steve is revealed to be a plant alien on a mission. Now on the plant planet, they shoot spores to Earth (going right next to the "Futurama" ship with a cloth saying "BRING BACK FUTURAMA" and then getting blown up by The Orville). In Springfield, everyone turns into plant versions of themselves. The transformed citizens are transported to a utopian plant planet with no technology. The Plant People see the citizens with pods (Mapple products) and ask where they found those. Bart says they found it under the living Christmas tree.
Multiplisa-ty.
After a sleepover at Milhouse's, Milhouse, Nelson, and Bart find themselves in a cell, trapped by Lisa, suffering from dissociative identity disorder (similar to James McAvoy's character from "Split"), then closes them in again after they do not ask for an encore on her performance.
Lisa attacks and kills Milhouse and Nelson, before Bart asks her what happened to her to which Lisa tells the story: Bart grabbed Lisa's spelling test, changing her answers, mocking Miss Hoover and granting her a F. Lisa has a last change and gives Bart a last chance to save himself and he redeems himself, saving himself from being killed by trash, while Milhouse was transformed into a "paper boy".
Geriatric Park.
In a parody of "Jurassic Park, Mr. Burns" opens up a Jurassic-themed retirement home, a park filled with elders rejuvenated mixing their DNA with dinosaurs. He brings Springfielders to the park, showing them the new "retirement home". At first they are all human, healthy and feeling young again, with incredible strength too. Once Homer raises the temperature after Grandpa complains about the temperature being too cold with Homer also quoting "I can't read, I'm on vacation" after seeing the warning sign, they transform into dinosaur versions of themselves.
Visitors and Mr. Burns are killed by the elders, Agnes Skinner as a "Ludodactylus" eats off Principal Skinner's arm, Jasper as a "Dilophosaurus" bites off Kirk Van Houten's head, and the Simpson family are threatened by Grandpa and Jacqueline Bouvier (turned into an "Indominus rex"-like theropod and a "Parasaurolophus" respectively). Lisa courageously confronts Grandpa and find out they all just needed to be cherished and respected. In the end, the Simpson family escape alive and unharmed, though their helicopter is being flown on the back of the transformed Agnes.
Reception.
Tony Sokol of "Den of Geek" gave the episode 3 out of 5 points ranking, stating "Ultimately this is a disappointing Halloween installment, not horrifyingly though. We rely on "The Simpsons"' 'Treehouse of Horror' stories to be the high point of any season. They have consistently been immediate classics. But "XXIX" is only lukewarm. The series has been edging closer to the "clever" side of humor over the irreverently silly, and the laughs are increasingly muted. This episode hosts some of the largest creatures of the world of terror, dinosaurs and Cthulhu. It's a shame the laughs aren't bigger.
Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave the episode a C+ ranking, stating "It’s tempting after a dully serviceable outing like this to say it’s time to bury the ‘Treehouse of Horror’ concept as an unnecessary annual disappointment. But then you’d have to say that of the series itself, which, okay, some of you do. I’d maintain that "The Simpsons"’ decades-long role as pop cultural ‘not as good as it used to be’ punching bag could be reversed with some new creative blood in the form of those writers raised on "The Simpsons" who want nothing better than to jolt the lumbering comedy behemoth back to life. But, as the show plods on, it seems that that’s the one thing those in charge of the shambling enterprise are truly afraid of."
Jess Scheden of "IGN" gave the episode a 5.6 out of 10 points ranking, stating "It almost never feels like there's enough room for the writers to really take advantage of these horror parodies. The result is a lot of easy, surface level gags. More and more I find myself wondering if the series would be better off switching to an hour-long format or, better yet, devoting the entire special to one story."
“Treehouse of Horror XXIX” scored a 1.3 rating with a 6 share and was watched by 2.95 million viewers, making “The Simpsons” Fox’s highest rated show of the night.

New Order Regiments

"New order regiments" "(Russian: "Полки иноземного (нового) строя")", also known in the literature as "foreign formation regiments", were professional military units formed in Russian Tsardom in XVII century, armed and trained in line with the Western European armies.
Prelude.
First attempts with Western military training in Russia were made by Mikhail Skopin-Shuisky in 1609, during De la Gardie Campaign.
In 1630 the Muscovite government began to hire mercenary officers in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Scotland to train a new, "foreign formation force" ("inozemskii stroi") in the new tactics. Six regiments of infantry ("soldaty"), a regiment of heavy cavalry pistoleers ("reitary"), and a regiment of dragoons ("draguny") were formed from Muscovite peasant militiamen, Cossacks, service class cavalrymen and free volunteers from various social categories. Unlike the traditional formation troops, the new regiments were outfitted and salaried at treasury expense.
Formation.
After the Smolensk War most, but not all of the expensive "foreign formation regiments" had been disbanded. A few thousand "foreign formation" infantry and dragoons had manned the Abatis Line, but in 1646 the government decided to make "foreign formation" units an important permanent element in the army. A number of officers were hired abroad, especially in the Netherlands; a "war manual" on the exercise of musket and pike was translated into Russian, to help in training Muscovite infantry; a new census was conducted to levy troops by household (one from every 20-100 homes); and Tsar Alexis placed thousands of "state serfs" along the border in standing service as ‘settled’ dragoons and infantry, drilled in their villages year-round under foreign officers.
Organization.
During military reforms in 1648 four types of professional regiments were formed:
Reiters and Hussars wore Western-style armor, at first imported, but after 1654 manufactured in Tula.
Combat service.
During Russo-Polish War (1654–1667), the number of the foreign formation troops grew (7 percent of the Muscovite army in 1651, 79 percent in 1663). With the exception of the better-trained Reiter regiments, the "soldat" infantry was still of limited use on the battlefield. More importantly, though, these infantry regiments were conscripted from serfs and commoners, so it was easier to rebuild them than damaged units of traditional hereditary servitors-Landed cavalry and Streltsy.

Agelanthus atrocoronatus is a species of hemiparasitic plant in the family Loranthaceae. It is endemic to Tanzania. It is known only from the Mufindi Plateau in Tanzania, and was last collected in the 1980s.
Habitat/ecology.
"A. atrocoronatus" is parasitic on various hosts including Vitaceae (the wine-grape family), is bird pollinated, and found in grassland and at the edges of montane forest.
Threats &amp; conservation efforts.
The major threats to this species are from urban expansion, and from the exploitation of the trees which host it. 
Conservation efforts center on local tea estates which currently afford protection to the forests remaining within them.

Omise'eke Natasha Tinsley is Professor of Black Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Previously she was an Associate Professor of African and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Texas at Austin. She is trained in literary critique, and does work in Caribbean Studies, Black Diaspora Studies, Gender and Women's Studies, and Pop Culture Studies. She is the author of "Thiefing Sugar: Eroticism between Women in Caribbean Literature" (Duke University Press, 2010), and "Ezili′s Mirrors: Imagining Black Queer Genders" (Duke University Press, 2018). She received the F.O. Matthiessen Visiting Professorship of Gender and Sexuality at Harvard for the 2018–2019 school year. Her latest work "Beyoncé in Formation: Remixing Black Feminism" (University of Texas Press, 2018) was published in November 2018. It is based on her course at University of Texas Austin entitled "Beyoncé Feminism, Rihanna Womanism", which launched in Spring 2015"."
She received her Ph.D. in Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley in 2003.
"Beyoncé in Formation: Remixing Black Feminism".
Tinsley released "Beyoncé in Formation: Remixing Black Feminism" in 2018 through the University of Texas Press. Tinsley was inspired to write the book after moving to Texas as a new mother and black woman and really connecting to Beyoncé, who herself is a black mother from Texas. She started teaching the course "Beyoncé Feminism, Rihanna Womanism" in 2015, which proved to be very popular with the student body. Tinsley was approached about writing a book sometime after the release of the critically acclaimed album "Lemonade" in 2016 and was inspired by the record to write "Beyoncé in Formation". The book uses songs and lyrics from "Lemonade" to explain feminist theories, specifically ideas surrounding black feminism, as well as including stories from the author's own life that help explain why she (and so many others) have such a strong connection to Beyoncé's work. In the introduction of the book, Tinsley describes it as "a popular music study and a memoir, this book puts "Lemonade" in conversations with representations of black Southern femininities from blues to New Orleans bounce, quadroon balls to the Country Music Awards, and "Love and Hip Hop: Atlanta" to #BlackTransLivesMatter."
The book is broken down into three sections, with each one highlighting a different aspect of black feminism that Beyoncé utilizes in "Lemonade":
In each section, Tinsley cites specific Beyoncé lyrics and music video visuals to support the theories that she outlines throughout the book.

Other interests.
Pierre de Lauzun is also : 
Theoretical contribution.
The author provides reflexions mainly inspired by Thomistic philosophy (Thomism) and by Catholic Social Teaching, as well as by his professional experience in finance, on philosophical, political, economic and financial issues, as well as his action in favour of a more ethical finance.
Philosophical dimension.
The perspective of the plurality of philosophies Philosophy is discussed in his book 'Heaven and the Forest (Beyond Pluralism)' - Le Ciel et la Forêt (Au-delà du pluralisme) (2000) which shows that there is only a restricted and non-contradictory plurality of acceptable points of view, with a common reference given by the tradition of classical thought that culminates in Thomism. He defends the idea that such a plurality reaches to unity thanks to the divine perspective. This book is completed by an examination of the rationality of faith and its legitimate contribution to philosophy with 'Philosophy of Faith' - Philosophie de la foi (2015). In religious matters proper, he addressed the question of the plurality of religions and the central role of Christianity in Volume II of 'Heaven and the Forest (Christianity and Other Religions)' - Le Ciel et la Forêt (Le christianisme et les autres religions) (2000). 
As regards Time, his basic book is 'Time, History, Eternity' -Temps Histoire Éternité (2006). This book relates the diversity of human conceptions of time to the eternity of God, thus offering a reflection on the meaning of personal destiny and of history. From the religious perspective, he examines the issue of Christian Revelation and the development of Christian doctrine in history, considering it as an expression of eternity in time in 'Christian revelation or eternity in time', 2018 - La révélation chrétienne ou l’éternité dans le temps.
Political dimension.
His reflection on politics questions the relationship between plurality, which is inherent to the political debate, and the idea of truth, as a norm for morality. His book, 'The Future of Democracy' - L’Avenir de la Démocratie (2011) focuses on the complexity of the concept of democracy and the tormented history of its emergence. He emphasizes that alongside the political system and the rule of law, a central role has been played by what he calls democratic ideology, which is in fact a paradigm of normative neutrality, based on the rejection of the collective search for a common and objective idea of good, and favoring mere procedures confronting individual choices. He doubts such a regime can be sustainable in the long run. This book has been completed and developed in 2019 by "Pour un grand retournement politique : face aux impasses du paradigme actuel".
In his book 'Survival Guide to an Unstable, Heterogeneous and Unregulated World' -Guide de survie dans un monde instable, hétérogène, non régulé (2017), the multiple effects of this lack of common reference in a fragmented world such as ours, is discussed from various angles: geopolitical, military, financial, economic, political and cultural, and he questions the possible ways to overcome the failures of the Western model.
Pierre de Lauzun is particularly interested in the political role of the nation : in his book 'Nations and Their Destiny' - Les nations et leur destin (2005), he shows both that nations are rooted in their cultural and linguistic characteristics as much as in their history, and their essential role for the constitution of real democracy.
'Christianity and Democracy' (2003) - Chrétienté et démocratie deals with the complex relations in history between Christianity and politics, particularly with democracy (2003).
Economic and financial dimension.
'The Gospel, Christians, and Money' (2004) - L’Évangile, les Chrétiens et l’Argent deals with the general question of economics from a Christian perspective, drawing on the Gospel and Catholic social teaching.
'Economics and Christianity' (2010) - L’Économie et le christianisme (2010) extends and broadens this perspective by emphasizing, on the one hand, the central role of ethics in economics, and on the other hand the importance of the question of risk, a basic limit to human action, which can find a counterweight in the trust in divine providence
At the same time, 'Christianity and economic growth' (2008) - Christianisme et croissance économique (2008) historically shows the key role of Christianity in the economic growth of the Western world
'Finance, a Christian Perspective' (2013) - Finance, un regard chrétien (2013) traces, still from the Gospel, the reflection and experience of the Catholic Church in financial matters, highlighting the incompleteness of finance itself and its need for an ethical perspective. For this book the author was awarded the international prize of the Centesimus Annus Foundation of the Vatican. Published in English in the US in 2021 as 'Finance A Christian Perspective' by Angelico Press. It is followed by "L'Argent, Maître ou serviteur" (2019) dedicated to our relationship to money.
This same question is taken up again without appealing to explicitly Christian references in 'Can Finance serve Man?' (2015) - La Finance peut-elle être au service de l’homme ?, which is completed by reflections on the role of regulation, particularly in view of the 2008 crisis. 
Finally, a small book on the euro raises the question of currency in general, and more particularly the difficulties posed by this single currency : 'Euro: The end of the single currency?' (2017) - Euro : vers la fin de la monnaie unique ?.

Damage (Mýa song)

"Damage" is a song recorded by American singer Mýa. Originally, the track was completed back in 2011, however was placed on hold due to "timing." Described as a "vulnerable" song, "Damage" was written and conceptualized by Lindsay "Mavelle" Gilbert and Mýa, while production was helmed by Los Da Mystro with additional contribution from frequent collaborator Lamar "MyGuyMars" Edwards. Inspired by musicians Prince, The Isley Brothers and Mint Condition, "Damage," musically incorporates a combination of electric guitar, drums and keys. Released March 23, 2018, Damage served as the fourth single from Harrison's eighth studio album "TKO (The Knock Out)" (2018). A music video directed, produced, and choreographed by renowned choreographer Galen Hooks premiered via "Complex" and MTV's "Total Request Live" in July 2018.
Background.
As tradition, on February 14, 2016, Mýa released her seventh studio album "Smoove Jones" (2016) to commemorate the release of her debut single "It's All About Me" and eighteenth anniversary in the entertainment industry. The release paid homage to R&amp;B/soul/hip-hop with old school elements from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was released exclusively through Apple Music. Critically, "Smoove Jones" received "generally favourable" reviews from music critics. In 2017, "Smoove Jones" received a nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held on February 12, 2017. Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, Mýa released a music video for the fan favorite "Coolin'". Filmed in Sydney, director Matt Sharp captures the singer's unmistakable beauty while she lets her vocals do the rest on a sandy beach.
In late 2017, Mýa released the first single from the forthcoming studio album, Ready for Whatever on September 22, 2017. A music video for "Ready for Whatever" was produced and directed by Mýa co-starring R&amp;B singer Kevin McCall as her love interest. Less than two months, its follow up single and sequel, Ready, Part II was released on November 24, 2017. The song paid homage to R.Kelly's It Seems Like You're Ready. A third single, "You Got Me" was released on February 14, 2018 to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of her debut single "It's All About Me."
Recording and release.
Initially, "Damage" was written, produced and recorded back in 2011. A collaborative effort, "Damage" is a four-minute and 43-second contemporary R&amp;B midtempo written by singer-songwriter Lindsey "Mavelle" Gilbert, Torauss Johnson and Mýa, with production overseen by producers Los Da Mystro and My Guy Mars. Pulling from the inspiration of 70's and 90's R&amp;B, "Damage" starts with a couple of very soft inflections in reminiscent of The Isley Brothers, but gradually build vocally like Stokley of R&amp;B band Mint Condition and combines the guitar dynamics of Prince.
To prep for its release, Mýa had announced and previewed "Damage" her Instagram account. Beginning March 16, 2018 fans had the option to pre-order "Damage." Her new single, "Damage" was officially released on March 23, 2018.
Music video.
Background.
The music video for "Damage" premiered televised on MTV's "TRL" and digitally online via "Complex". Speaking with "Complex", Mýa revealed the message behind the song, commenting, "'Damage' is about taking risks, stepping into new territory regardless of the outcome, while further explaining, this thing we call love has always been tricky and as beautiful as it can be, we can potentially lose ourselves in it. With the good often comes the bad. That's life and it's scary, noting lastly, that with an intense passion and yearning, I'm willing to risk it all for that special one who sets my soul and desire on fire, despite the potential damage it may bring."
Synopsis.
"Damage" is described as an eye catching video which was directed, produced, choreographed, edited, and styled by Galen Hooks—a choreographer known for her work with artists like Rihanna, Usher, Britney Spears, and Justin Bieber. Against minimalist industrial backdrops, Hooks' powerful choreography plays up the defiant nature of the song as Mýa delivers a dynamic performance."

Joseph diGenova

Joseph diGenova (born February 22, 1945) is an American lawyer and political commentator who served as the United States Attorney for the District of Columbia from 1983 to 1988. He and his wife, Victoria Toensing, are partners in the Washington, D.C., law firm diGenova and Toensing. He is known for promoting conspiracy theories about the Department of Justice and the FBI. He and Toensing frequently appeared on Fox News and Fox Business channels, until diGenova used a November 2019 appearance to spread conspiracy theories about George Soros, leading to widespread calls for him to be banned from the network.
In March 2018, President Donald Trump announced that diGenova and Toensing would join his legal defense team during the Mueller investigation; the appointments were withdrawn days later, citing an unspecified conflict of interest, though Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow said they might assist in other legal matters. In July 2019, diGenova and Toensing began representing Ukrainian oligarch Dmitry Firtash to assist his efforts to avoid extradition to the United States under a federal indictment, as their associate and Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani sought information in Ukraine to damage Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. In November 2020, Trump named diGenova, Toensing, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis to join a legal team led by Giuliani to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Trump was defeated.
Career in law and politics.
DiGenova was an aide to Republican Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland, eventually serving as Mathias' legislative director. After Republicans won the U.S. Senate in the 1980 elections, DiGenova was named chief counsel and staff director of the Senate Rules Committee and counsel to the Senate Judiciary, Governmental Affairs, and Select Intelligence committees.
U.S. attorney.
As a U.S. attorney, diGenova led the prosecution of Jonathan Pollard, who pleaded guilty in 1987 to spying for Israel.
He also led investigations into corruption in the administration of Washington, D.C., Mayor Marion Barry that led to convictions of 12 officials, including two deputy mayors.
Counsel investigations.
DiGenova later served as Independent Counsel investigating the 1992 preelection search of then-candidate Bill Clinton's passport file by officials of the George H. W. Bush administration. DiGenova concluded that the passport search had been "stupid, dumb and partisan," but not illegal, and that the government should apologize to the officials who ordered the search.
DiGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, started their Washington law firm, diGenova &amp; Toensing, in January 1996.
In 1997, diGenova was named Special Counsel to investigate the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; afterward he was named to an independent review board to monitor the Teamsters.
Trump presidency.
Scooter Libby.
DiGenova called on President Trump to pardon Scooter Libby, adviser of Dick Cheney, who was found guilty of perjury in an investigation revolving around leaks of sensitive classified material. DiGenova is married to Libby's lawyer, Victoria Toensing. Trump pardoned Libby on April 13, 2018.
Russian interference in the 2016 election.
DiGenova, who frequently appears as a commentator on Fox News, has accused FBI officials of trying to "frame" President Donald Trump for "nonexistent" crimes. On March 19, 2018, he and his spouse, Victoria Toensing, were hired to serve on Trump's legal team for the Special Counsel investigation. However, Trump backtracked the hires several days later due to potential conflicts of interest. The president hoped diGenova could function as a stand-in for him on television and spearhead the attacks on Mueller and the investigation.
In April 2018, diGenova called for the firing of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said that special counsel Robert Mueller's team investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election were "legal terrorists" and called former FBI Director James Comey "a dirty cop". In May 2018 tweet, Trump quoted diGenova as saying "The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States."
On February 21, 2019, diGenova stated in the podcast of Laura Ingraham that the US is in a civil war and that he advises friends to prepare for total war by voting and buying guns.
Kavanaugh appointment.
On September 18, 2018, diGenova discounted charges that U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, then 17 years old, had allegedly sexually assaulted a 15-year-old Christine Blasey Ford at a party. The allegations referred to a time when Kavanaugh was attending Georgetown Preparatory School. On Fox News, diGenova said if Ford testified, "she's going to look like the loon that she is."
Ukraine investigations.
In July 2019, diGenova and his wife, Victoria Toensing, were hired by the Ukrainian oligarch Dmytro Firtash, to defend Firtash from extradition to the United States on corruption charges related to a mining permit in India. In 2017, the United States Justice Department described Firtash as an "upper-echelon [associate] of Russian organized crime." As a middleman for the Russian natural gas giant Gazprom, Firtash was known for funneling money to campaigns of pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine and is also a onetime business partner of Paul Manafort, a Trump 2016 campaign chairman. When he was vice president, Joe Biden had urged the Ukrainian government to eliminate middlemen such as Firtash from the country's natural gas industry, and to reduce the country's reliance on imports of Russian natural gas.
In August 2019, diGenova and Toensing met with Attorney General William Barr to argue against the charges for Firtash. Prior to that meeting, Barr had been briefed in detail on the initial Trump-Ukraine scandal whistleblower complaint within the CIA that had been forwarded to the Justice Department, as well as on Giuliani's activities in Ukraine. Barr declined to intercede, according to sources who talked to "The Washington Post".
In October 2019, Lev Parnas, a businessman who was working for diGenova and Toensing's firm as an interpreter in the Firtash case, was one of two men arrested at Dulles International Airport and accused by federal prosecutors of funneling foreign money into U.S. elections. "The New York Times" reported in November 2019 that Giuliani had directed Parnas to approach Firtash with the recommendation to hire diGenova and Toensing, with the proposition that Firtash could help to provide compromising information on Joe Biden, an arrangement Parnas's attorney Joseph Bondy described was "part of any potential resolution to [Firtash's] extradition matter." In November 2019, Bondy told "The Washington Post" that Parnas had been part of "a group that met frequently in spring 2019 at the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., to discuss the Biden matter, among other topics. The group, according to Bondy, was convened by Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and included Parnas, his business associate Igor Fruman, as well as journalist John Solomon and the husband-and-wife legal team of Joe diGenova and Victoria Toensing." After Firtash hired diGenova and Toensing, Giuliani acquired a statement from former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin that falsely alleged Biden had pressured Ukraine to fire him in an effort to cover up corruption by Biden and his son. Shokin's statement noted that it was prepared "at the request of lawyers acting for Dmitry Firtash." Giuliani had presented the Shokin statement during television appearances, and "Bloomberg News" reported that its sources told them Giuliani's publicity of the Shokin statement had greatly reduced the chances of the Justice Department dropping the charges against Firtash, as it would appear to be a political "quid pro quo".
DiGenova and Toensing worked with Rudy Giuliani on opposition research from Ukraine to be used against the 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden, according to Fox News Sunday. All three were working off the books, outside the administration, according to Fox News. "The only person in government who knows what they were doing is President Trump," Fox host Chris Wallace said. DiGenova called the story "categorically false."
DiGenova and Toensing are lawyers for John Solomon, a conservative columnist who has written stories favorable to Trump on scandals involving Ukraine and Russia. "John Solomon has been a client of our firm for a very long time," diGenova told "Politico".
In November 2019, in an appearance on Fox News, diGenova claimed that George Soros "controls a very large part of the career foreign service of the United States State Department" and "also controls the activities of FBI agents overseas who work for NOG's, work with NGO's. That was very evident in Ukraine." The Open Society Foundation, founded by Soros, described diGenova's claims as "beyond rhetorical ugliness, beyond fiction, beyond ludicrous" and requested that Fox News provide an on-air retraction of diGenova's claims, and stop providing diGenova with a platform. Although the network never publicly announced it had banned diGenova, , diGenova had not appeared on Fox following the incident. In September 2020, diGenova said, "I don't know what George Soros has on Suzanne Scott, the head of Fox, but the bottom line is this: that network is compromised when it comes to Soros."
Claims of fraud related to the 2020 presidential election.
In November 2020, President Donald Trump named diGenova, Toensing, Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis to join a legal team led by Rudy Giuliani to challenge the results of the 2020 presidential election in which Trump was defeated.
On November 30, 2020, diGenova used an appearance on "The Howie Carr Show" (released on YouTube) to call for Chris Krebs to be "drawn and quartered. Taken out at dawn and shot". DiGenova's specific criticism was that Krebs "thinks the election went well". Krebs was the former Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency for the United States Department of Homeland Security and had been fired by Trump earlier that month for contradicting Trump's claims of widespread election fraud. On December 8 Krebs filed a civil lawsuit against diGenova, the Trump campaign, and Newsmax TV, accusing them of "defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, aiding and abetting, and civil conspiracy". He said that he has received "a barrage of threats and harassment" as a result of diGenova's comments and "faces a genuine risk of imminent harm."

Dana Lewis (basketball)

Dana Lewis (born October 16, 1949) is a retired American collegiate and professional basketball player. Lewis was a 1st Round selection (#12 overall) of the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1971 NBA Draft out of the University of Tulsa.
Early life.
In 1966, Dana Lewis moved with his mother from New York City to Newark, New Jersey. He attended Weequahic High School in Newark. There he played basketball and was a teammate of future NBA player Mo Layton in a highly successful program. In 1966-1967 Weequahic went undefeated and won the Group 4 State Championship, defending their title from the year before.
Weequahic High School in 1965–66 and 1966–67 had each of the five starters go on to play college basketball. Two reached the National Basketball Association. The five were Layton, Lewis, Leroy Cobb, George Watson and Bill Mainor. Layton played with Phoenix and Portland in the NBA after a college career at the University of Southern California. Mainor played at Fordham, and Cobb and Watson played at Southern California with Layton.
“Yes, that was quite a ballclub,” reminisced Les Fein, the Weequahic coach. “Not only were the boys excellent players, but they were gentlemen.”
College career.
Following his high school career, Lewis was heavily recruited. The Associated Press release on April 19, 1967 read as follows: "NEWARK, N.J. (AP) Dana Lewis, Wcequahic High School's 6-foot-10 All-America basketball player, rejected the recruiting efforts of virtually every major college in the country and announced that he will attend Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Okla., for religious reasons. Oral Roberts, which is only two years old, is named after and administered by the world-famed evangelist, acknowledged spiritual leader of the Pentecostal Church, to' which Lewis' family belongs. Lewis led Weequahic to 40 straight victories and two New Jersey State championships."
As a 6’10" Center playing for Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma as a freshman, Lewis averaged 16.0 points and 10.2 rebounds in 24 games.
Lewis' mother had influenced him to attend Oral Roberts University for his first collegiate season, and after one season he wished to transfer. Deciding to stay in town and transfer to the University of Tulsa, Lewis needed a release from ORU to be eligible. While awaiting a release, Lewis stayed in Tulsa and got a job hauling hay. He eventually paid his own tuition the first semester at Tulsa by working a construction job. Finally, Oral Roberts himself wrote a handwritten release for Lewis to be able to play for Tulsa.
At Tulsa, Lewis averaged 20.3 points and 11.9 bounds in 1969-1970 and 23.3 points and 13.5 rebounds in 1970–1971, while playing under coach Ken Hayes. In 1970, Lewis was named the "Missouri Valley Conference Newcomer of the Year.". In 1970–1971, Lewis led the Missouri Valley Conference in scoring and was First-Team All-MVC in both Tulsa seasons. Lewis still holds the Tulsa record for Rebounds in a game with 26, vs. MacMurray College, on Dec. 27, 1969.
Overall, in 52 games for Tulsa, Lewis averaged a double-double of 21.8 points and 12.7 rebounds over his two seasons.
After graduating from Tulsa, Lewis was selected for the World University Games, where Team USA earned a bronze medal, losing to USSR in the final. George McGinnis was a teammate on the USA team.
Professional career.
Lewis was drafted in the 1st Round (12th overall) of the 1971 NBA Draft by the Philadelphia 76ers on May 9, 1971. Lewis was also drafted by the Virginia Squires in the 1971 ABA Draft. He chose to sign with the 76ers. Originally signing a 6-year $500,000 mostly guaranteed contract, Lewis was cut by the 76ers on Sept. 27, 1972 after the third game of the season, before appearing in an NBA game.
Lewis went on to play four seasons in the Eastern Basketball Association. He played for the Hartford Capitols (1971-1974) and the Cherry Hill Pros (1974-1975). The Capitols won the League title in 1973-1974 as Lewis averaged 12.3 points and 15.3 rebounds.
Later, Lewis played in the Philippine Basketball Association as an "import" for Presto and Great Taste Coffee Makers teams from 1976 to 1979.
Honors.
Lewis was inducted into the University of Tulsa Athletics Hall of Fame in 2019.

Vruće Ljetovanje

Vruće Ljetovanje (English: "Hot Summer Vacation") is an adventure game published by Suzy Soft for ZX Spectrum in 1985. It was written and developed by Ivan Gerenčir and Milan Pavičević, with graphics done by artist Igor Kordey. The game is notable for being the first Yugoslav adventure game with full color graphics, as well as the first adventure game from Croatia. The game depicts the daily life of Srećko, and his family, who are preparing for a trip to their summer vacation on the coastline, and as such portrays the daily life in the former country. It was published simultaneously in Serbo-Croatian and Slovenian language and retailed at 900 Yugoslav dinars.
Plot.
The protagonist, Srećko, lives a daily life with his family in an economically unstable Yugoslavia and is at some point asked by his wife, Milica, to prepare a summer vacation for them to the coastline. He then embarks on an adventure going through daily life attempting to survive and support his family thus running into many obstacles along the way.
Gameplay.
The game's display is divided in three sections, where the first two sections provide the first-person perspective image of the player's location, with the last third conveying text information such as descriptions, current date and time as well as a console for the player to give commands.
The gameplay is based on real-time method, the plot features 13 major autonomous NPCs which move from one area to another depending on time, and an open world, aspects already established in previous adventure games. It also introduces hunger and fatigue as parameters which greatly affect the player potentially resulting in his death. These factors also depend on each other, for instance "run to the store before it closes to get food so you don't starve to death, but your fatigue prevents you from running". The player can travel both by foot or by car.
Financial planning of food, car gas, gifts and vacation is also mandatory for the player's progression, as it could end the game through bankruptcy. You get several sources of income (piggy bank, monthly salary, savings etc.) which you need to spend during the course of the adventure without fully depleting it.
Reception.
It was praised by the Slovenian computer magazine "Moj mikro" as easily one of the better Yugoslavian programs in its November issue. Another prominent magazine Svet Kompjutera, favourably compared it to other games of the genre such as "The Hobbit", "Sherlock", and "Eric", even praising it as having better and more humorous solutions than the aforementioned games. It particularly noted its very fast routine for image display and the large span of words that could be used during play.

King Lear (2018 film)

King Lear is a 2018 British-American television film directed by Richard Eyre. An adaptation of the play of the same name by William Shakespeare, cut to just 115 minutes, was broadcast on BBC Two on 28 May 2018. Starring Anthony Hopkins as the title character, the adaptation is set in an alternative universe, 21st-century, highly militarised London and depicts the tragedy that follows when the sovereign King Lear announces the end of his reign and the division of his kingdom among his three daughters. The adaptation was met with positive reviews, which commended its acting and many singled out Hopkins for his performance in the title role.
Plot.
Set in an alternative universe, 21st-century, highly militarised London, the sovereign King Lear calls his family together one evening in order for him to announce the division of his kingdom among his three daughters. The two elder daughters, Regan and Goneril, make open statements about their allegiance to and love for their father and receive each a share of the kingdom. The king's youngest daughter Cordelia, however, finds the act of making such a verbal statement superficial and declines to make a comparable declaration. As a result, she is refused her share of the inheritance, which is now entirely divided between her two elder sisters, and is left to her own devices to survive.
Goneril later accuses the retired King Lear of dotage. Regan accuses the king's retinue of being riotous.
Production.
In October 2017, the BBC commissioned a new adaptation of the Shakespeare play in a co-production with Amazon Studios, starring Anthony Hopkins as the title character, with Emma Thompson, Emily Watson and Florence Pugh as his daughters. Filming began in the same month in Stevenage. A "first look" image was distributed in February 2018.
Scenes were also filmed in various locations in Dover, Kent, such as at Dover Castle, Samphire Hoe, and Abbot's Cliff.
Reception.
Critical response.
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 91% based on 22 reviews, and an average rating of 7.67/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Led by dual mesmerizing performances from Sir Anthony Hopkins and Dame Emma Thompson and rounded out by a solidly stocked ensemble, this "King Lear" is a highly watchable adaptation." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a normalized score of 76 out of 100, based on 6 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Sam Wollaston of "The Guardian" commended Hopkins' performance as Lear, deeming him "shouty, vulnerable and absolutely mesmerising" and wrote that "Shakespeare on television – a box it wasn't designed for and doesn't necessarily fit – isn't always successful. It only works if it's not just a play on the telly, but something in its own right, too, with its own identity. This one achieves that, with pace and modernity." "The Wall Street Journal"'s John Anderson also commended Hopkins' performance, writing that he enjoyed watching him "gnash his teeth, wail and go gloriously mad opposite one of the best supporting casts imaginable."
"Vulture" Matt Zoller Seitz praised the "terrific" cast and the story's sub-plots, writing "Eyre has cut the text to the bone, sometimes to its detriment, though the edits elevate the play's parallel, secondary story--the bastard Edmund (John McMillan) plotting against his father, the Earl of Gloucester (Jim Broadbent) and his half-brother Edgar (Andrew Scott)--in fascinating ways." Hanh Nguyen of "IndieWire" wrote that the adaptation "starts to break down near the last third with a choppiness that takes a toll on the logic of the piece" but commended the performances and stated "Amazon's King Lear is by no means a definitive adaptation of what is arguably the Bard's finest tragedy, but it is a thrilling and entertaining one."

UNHhhh

UNHhhh is an American comedy web series starring drag queens Trixie Mattel and Katya Zamolodchikova. In the series, Trixie and Katya discuss a topic humorously in front of a green screen. "UNHhhh" premiered on March 25, 2016, one year after Mattel and Zamolodchikova appeared in the seventh season of "RuPaul's Drag Race". The show is aired through World Of Wonder's YouTube channel, as well as through its video-on-demand service WOW Presents Plus. "UNHhhh" has been nominated for four Streamy Awards throughout its run, finally winning Unscripted Series at the 2020 ceremony, which they also hosted.
Production.
The show began in March 2016, and aired 65 episodes before World of Wonder announced the conclusion to the show and the premiere "The Trixie &amp; Katya Show", a television spin-off on Viceland. "The Trixie &amp; Katya Show" was cancelled after one season and the series returned to YouTube for its third season in October 2018. Beginning with season three, new episodes would premiere on WOW Presents Plus uncensored the week before being released on YouTube. A fourth season aired from January 16 to September 12 2019, with a special Christmas episode on December 11, 2019.
On September 20, 2019, Trixie Mattel uploaded a video on her personal Twitter account revealing that the series will return for a fifth season, which premiered on January 22, 2020. The series then went into a brief hiatus from March to August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with "Trixie and Katya Save the World" airing as a replacement series during this time. On July 22nd World of Wonder released a teaser on their YouTube page saying that "UNHhhh" would be returning on August 5th with new episodes filmed during the pandemic and some that were filmed before but not edited. To accommodate social distancing guidelines Trixie and Katya were seated at a distance and filmed with multiple cameras, being edited to look closer together in the final cut. The season concluded on December 30, 2020 with the hosts confirming a sixth season would be produced which premiered on WOWPresents+ on April 21, 2021. Starting with season six, episodes were released on WOW Presents Plus one month before their YouTube debut.

Spin-offs.
Trixie and Katya Save the World.
"Trixie and Katya Save the World" was created as a replacement for "UNHhhh", which was on hiatus due to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

The series premiered on March 30, 2020, exclusively on WOW Presents Plus, although the eighth episode was also released on YouTube.
Reception.
"Vice"'s Rachel Miller stated, "Trixie and Katya’s show is actually my favorite part of all of this ["RuPaul's Drag Race" related fandom], and it totally stands alone; I’d recommend getting into it even if you don’t watch "Drag Race" proper." The show was positively reviewed by Rachel Paulson of "The Queer Creative" podcast.
UNHhhh, the Podcast.
During the COVID-19 filming hiatus, episodes 1-121 were uploaded in podcast format with later episodes being uploaded gradually.

Prior to playing professional football, he was in an orchestra and also performed in a jazz band; playing the trumpet to a grade-8 level.
Club career.
Notts County.
James-Wildin was offered trials at Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa, which were ultimately unsuccessful. He was scouted by Notts County whilst playing in an under-16 match in 2014.

British Cemetery of Bahia

The British Cemetery of Bahia (Portuguese: Cemitério dos Ingleses da Bahia) is a burial ground located in Salvador, the capital and largest city in the Brazilian state of Bahia. Its history dates back to the Navigation and Trade Treaty, also known as the Strangford Treaty, signed by the Kingdom of Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1810. The treated permitted the establishment of churches of the Church of England in Brazil, then a colony of Portugal. Built in 1814 and located in Avenida Sete de Setembro, more specifically Ladeira da Barra, it is the principal heritage site of the British community in Bahia. The British Cemetery was classified a state landmark by the Institute of Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Bahia (IPAC) in 1993.
History.
Anglicanism first arrived in Brazil in the early 19th century, when the Portuguese royal family fled there in 1808. The Royal Navy escorted the Portuguese vessels that sailed from Lisbon on 27 November 1807 after Napoleon invaded Portugal. Therefore, a number of British citizens landed in the country. Some of them decided to stay and open businesses after the Navigation and Trade Treaty was signed in 1810; it guaranteed lower tariffs for British products brought to Brazil. The British had a competitive advantage that led them to dominate the Brazilian market and form significant communities in port cities such as Salvador, Recife and Rio de Janeiro.
The Navigation and Trade Treaty also permitted the construction of Anglican churches in Brazil. However, they had to be built with a different structure from Catholic churches – meaning that they could not have towers or bells – and were forbidden to preach to locals. According to the legend, the treaty was signed by John VI of Portugal on the site where the cemetery was later built. The first burial in the British Cemetery occurred in 1813. The construction of the British Cemetery preceded that of Campo Santo Cemetery, the first public cemetery in Salvador. Before that, Bahians were buried in churches, with the exception of "heretics", that is, non-Catholics. They were forbidden to be interred alongside Catholics according to the Constitution of Bahia.
The Navigation and Trade Treaty changed that situation for the British people living in Brazil; they were the main commercial partners of Portugal and, yet, were having difficulty in practicing their Protestant faith in a country where the state religion was Catholicism. After the treaty was signed, the first Anglican services in Brazil were held in 1810 – in English and exclusively for members of the British community –, initially in private residences. In spite of their newly conquered religious freedom, the British were still in lack of a place for worship and for interring their dead.
Construction and inauguration.
On 8 February 1811, then-Governor of Bahia Marcos de Noronha e Brito authorized the construction of a cemetery in the capital of Bahia for the burial ceremonies of members of the British community. An Anglican chapel was soon built on the location; its first records date back to 1819. Until the inauguration of the Anglican Chapel of Salvador in October 1853, this chapel – known as Saint George's Church – was the only non-Catholic house of worship in the city. In Saint George's Church, the local Anglican community met and organized their practices. After the Anglican Chapel of Salvador was built, Saint George's stopped celebrating regular services and was only used for funerals.
The British Cemetery was built in an area owned by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of São Salvador da Bahia, more specifically to the nearby Church of Santo Antônio da Barra. Such was the influence of the British in Bahia back then that in 1814 Noronha e Brito expropriated the land from the Catholic Church and donated it to the British community, which founded the Saint George's Society to organize its activities. It is believed that the Church of Santo Antônio da Barra and the British Cemetery were connected by a portal until the mid-nineteenth century, which would have been proof of a peaceful relationship between Catholics and Anglicans in Salvador. The Methodist missionary Daniel Parish Kidder described the white walls of British Cemetery among other structures visible from the entrance of the Bay of All Saints in 1839.
According to researcher Francisco de Paula Santana de Jesus, the relationship between Bahians and German Protestants was much more hostile. Until the inauguration of the German Cemetery in 1851, they were also buried in the British Cemetery due to the prohibition of interring non-Catholics in public cemeteries.
Protected status.
The British Cemetery was classified a state landmark by the Institute of Artistic and Cultural Heritage of Bahia in 1993, being registered that same year. After a successful campaign led by the British scholar, Sabrina Gledhill, then a resident of Salvador, the site was restored in 2006 with funding from the State of Bahia and the Clemente Mariani Foundation ("Fundação Clemente Mariani"). Since its restoration, the Saint George's Society has been trying to have it listed by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage.
In 2008, the Saint George's Society, in a case heard by the Supreme Federal Court, was exempted from paying R$41,831.70 in property tax to the city of Salvador. According to the unanimous decision of the judges, non-profit cemeteries are exempt from taxes. In 2009, the British Cemetery hosted the opening of the "Darwin in Bahia "exposition. It marked the bicentenary of Charles Darwin, who visited Salvador during his "Beagle" expedition. Two of his travel companions are buried on the cemetery. In 2009, the Anglican Parish of the Good Shepherd has legally separated from the Saint George Society, who has since administered the British Cemetery as a non-profit organization.
Burials.
The first person interred in the British cemetery was a British slave trader born in Liverpool; he was buried in 1813. Besides him, some notable people were buried in the British Cemetery, such as:
Some British and American Consuls were also buried in the cemetery, along with members of the local Jewish community.

JF Hillebrand

JF Hillebrand is an international logistics company specializing in beer, wine and distilled spirits. The company provides airfreight, inland transport, warehousing, insurance, and inventory management. It's based in Mainz, Germany. Its US subsidiary is located in Napa Valley. Its services range from full container loads of bulk wine to small consignments via airfreight.
History.
The freight forwarder J. F. Hillebrand was founded on 1 July 1844 by 25-year-old Johann Friedrich Hillebrand (1819-1890) as a freight commission business with loading and unloading services including an associated customs agency. It is the world's largest wine and beverage forwarder. 
In the middle of the 19th century the wine trade in Mainz flourished again with the Rhine romanticism. Johann Friedrich Hillebrand acquired lighters for river transport and thus continued the inland navigation business of his ancestors. The Mainz-Ludwigshafen railway line, newly opened in 1853, and the West Rhine Railway, newly built in 1859, formed the basis for the expansion of business to include rail and the eastern markets. In 1875 the generation of sons followed with Dionis and Ludwig Damian Hillebrand and further expanded the Rhine freight traffic. In addition to their core business, they took over the Mainz agency for ship passages of the Hamburg-America Line for the Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Actien-Gesellschaft.
After the Second World War, Karl Hillebrand, Dionis' son, began inter-zone trading between the French occupied zone of Mainz and the surrounding area and the American occupied zone in Mainz-Kastel. Jan W. Hillebrand, who had returned from Allied captivity as a prisoner of war, took over the management of the Mainzer Lagerhaus A.G., which was integrated into the Hillebrand forwarding agency in 1953.
Until the 1960s, the Spedition exported worldwide, mainly German wines. From the middle of the decade more and more intermodal containers were used in the logistics business. The stable, sealed containers offered the advantage that the attractive freight was better protected against transport damage and theft. With Hillebrand's Wine-Line, this concept was also extended to other classic European wine exporting countries. In 1974 the company moved to the new premises in Mainz-Hechtsheim. In 1986 Jan W. Hillebrand left the company and handed over the business to Christof J. F. Hillebrand, the fifth generation of the family-run company.

José Santana (karateka)

José Manuel Guerreiro Santana (born May 17, 1957, in Lisbon) is a Portuguese karateka, twice world champion in kumite.
Biography.
José Santana began practicing martial arts at the age of fourteen with Shotokan Karate teacher Luís Cunha at Ginásio Clube Português (GCP), in Lisbon. Invited by a friend, he attends the training of Goju-ryu Seigokan at the Budo School in Sapadores, created by Mitsuharu Tsuchiya, having immediately joined with heart and soul this traditional style of karatedo when he watched the performing of Sanchin kata by Katsumune Nagai (4th Dan), 4-time Seigokan Champion in Inter-State Championships in Japan. Due to his immeasurable energy, he also practices Boxing, having been National Champion in his category for two consecutive years and been selected for the Olympic Games of Moscow, in 1980. Following the return of Nagai to Japan, and after the temporary interruption of the practice of this style in Portugal, he still practices Taekwondo at Sporting Clube de Portugal with Chung Sun Yong (9th Dan), also being national champion in this modality. She travels five times to Japan and several times to Macau, where he met Kata World Champion Atsuko Wakai, also from Seigokan, to participate in seminars, championships and to take his Dan grading tests at Hombu Dojo of Seigokan, in the city of Himeji, Japan.
In 1998, he became Seigokan Karate World Champion in Kumite and World Vice-Champion in Kata, a feat he would repeat in 2004 when he again became Seigokan's World Champion in Kumite. The year of 2008 marks a new stage in the martial career of this Lusitanian Master, when being graduated in 6th Dan with the attribution of the title of Shihan and been named Chief Instructor of Seigokan for Portugal and Europe, which is a great honor, since it is usually a charge played by Japanese Masters.
In 2012, he is appointed by the Seigokan Japanese Masters collective at the annual meeting at Hombu Dojo in Himeji, a full member of the Nippon Seigokan Board of Directors, and the corresponding Diploma is sent to him.&lt;br&gt;

The Pepperbox

The Pepperbox, also known as Eyre's Folly, is a folly tower that stands at the highest point on Pepperbox Hill, the peak of a chalk ridge about southeast of the city of Salisbury, Wiltshire, England. Built in 1606 by Giles Eyre, the folly is a three-storey hexagonal tower constructed of brick, although the entrances and windows have since been blocked up. The building's original purpose is unknown, though theories include that it was built to provide Eyre with views of Longford Castle or to provide local landowners' wives, including Eyre's wife Jane, with a lookout tower to watch the hunt. The tower is considered one of the oldest follies, and is a Grade II listed building. The tower and hillside are owned by the National Trust.
Origins and purpose.
Although the Historic England listing dates The Pepperbox to the early 18th century, it is accepted that the tower was built in 1606 by Giles Eyre of the nearby Brickworth House, hence the alternate name "Eyre's Folly". Eyre is known for being the father of settler John Eyre and grandfather of Giles Eyre, a judge. The original purpose of the tower is unknown. One theory is that Eyre was envious of the surreal Longford Castle, built by Sir Thomas Gorges, and built the Pepperbox to overlook the castle. Indeed, the epitaph on Eyre's gravestone describes him as "a man much oppressed by publick power." Another is that the tower was built as a hunting stand, perhaps so the local landowners' wives – including Eyre's wife Jane, whom he married in 1603 – could watch the hunt in comfort without being exposed to public gaze. In their book "Follies, Grottoes and Garden Building", Gwen Headley and Wim Meulenkamp consider the hunting stand theory to be "saner" given that the tower lacks a "folly atmosphere". One account states: "It can be counted as a folly but may have been used a lookout so that ladies could follow the progress of the hunt, away from the rain and mud".
Description and location.
The Pepperbox is a hexagonal, three-storey tower constructed of English bond brick, with a low, pyramidal Welsh slate roof that was rebuilt around 1900, topped by a weather vane. The ground floor's doorways are segmental-headed, indicating the building originally stood on open arches. The first floor features three-brick plat bands, while the second floor has a stepped cornice with windows under timber lintels. The building's doorways (one per face) and windows (one per face on the first and second floors) are all bricked in, a change that happened at an unknown time. The name "The Pepperbox" came about due to the tower's resemblance to a pepper pot or pepper box, used in the 17th and 18th centuries, and consequently also inspired the name of the hill that it stands on. The tower bears some similarities with the influential, octagonal Tower of the Winds in Athens, Greece, as does the 1782 folly of the same name at Mount Stewart, although the Pepperbox predates Nicholas Revett and James Stuart's recording of the Athens tower by some 150 years.
The folly stands at the highest point on Pepperbox Hill, the peak of a chalk ridge southeast of the city of Salisbury, Wiltshire. The site is in the northwest corner of the parish of Whiteparish, but is more closely associated with the village of Alderbury, which the tower overlooks. The hill has views far-reaching views both east and west, including over Salisbury. Gwen Headley suggests that the tower was built in the open countryside at such a location because Eyre believed that the land which the hill overlooks would "last forever," and that this potential impetus has been obscured by the changing of the landscape in the subsequent centuries. The folly is surrounded by a diverse habitat boasting many uncommon species including juniper, orchids and yew woodland.
Later history.
In the early 18th century, the Pepperbox was allegedly used as a haunt by highwaymen, who would attack carriages as they reached the summit of the hill, when the horses would be tired by the climb. The tower was used as a lookout post by the local Home Guard during World War II. It was designated a Grade II listed building as "The Pepperbox" in 1960, and today, both the folly and the hill it stands on are property of the National Trust.
Despite the theory that the Pepperbox was used as a lookout tower, it is today considered one of the earliest follies, dating from before the term "folly" was first used. The Pepperbox and the three other follies in and around Salisbury are regarded as the four oldest follies in Wiltshire. Regarding the Pepperbox, Headley writes that due to the tower being "isolated, unprotected, enigmatic and blank," the sudden sight of the "strange, anonymous small building" provokes questions from unfamiliar passers-by. She notes that the tower is considered a folly because it is a "misunderstood building." In their 1976 book "Wiltshire", Nikolaus Pevsner and Bridget Cherry note the Pepperbox as one of several early 17th century "oddments" in the county, alongside the two triangular gatehouses of Amesbury, built in 1600 and 1607, and Newhouse in Redlynch, built in 1619. The Pepperbox is listed in Peter Long's book "The Hidden Places of England".

The Fight Within (album)

The Fight Within is the second studio album by musical artist iskwē. It was released independently on November 3, 2017
Reception.
In an interview with the CBC's Andrea Gin, iskwé stated her three key influences were protecting the planet, community, and future generations. Jim Di Gioia found the album introspective and personal. He particularly cited “Will I See” as a dialogue between the singer and the multitude of missing and murdered indigenous women in Canada.Di Gioia mentions how iskwé says the song came to her immediately following a solidarity walk in Winnipeg that traveled the distance from where Tina Fontaine’s body was discovered to the monument for missing and murdered women in Winnipeg. Another review points to her Irish and Cree/Dené/Métis roots as contributing to her sound. Producers on the independently released album include The Darcys on "Nobody Knows", Hayden Wolf on "Soldier" and "Will I See"; and Keolya on "Sometimes" and "The Storm".
Awards and recognition.
"The Fight Within" was nominated for a Juno Award for Indigenous Album of the Year.
