Church of the Resurrection, Ely

The Church of the Resurrection is a listed Anglican church in the suburb of Ely, Cardiff.
History.
Historically part of the Parish of Llandaff, the hamlet of Ely was transferred to the parish of St Mary the Virgin in 1869. In 1871, the small mission church of St David's was built to serve Ely. In the early years of the 20th Century, a further mission was founded in the shape of a tin tabernacle, staffed by the Community of the Resurrection and members of the Church Army. In 1933, plans were under consideration for St David's to be purchased (subject to the agreement of the parish) by Cardiff Corporation for use by the residents of Ely Lodge Public Assistance Institution (later Ely Hospital, a hospice and mental health facility). If this were to proceed, the plans proposed to replace both St David's and the tin tabernacle with a single new church for the whole of Ely. The original designs of 1933 envisaged a church capable of seating 500 at a cost of £5000, but these were eventually superseded by a grander design by Thomas Roderick seating 600 which Lord Glanely wished to present to the parish as a gift in memory of his deceased wife. The church, built at the location of the tin tabernacle to a Neo-Byzantine style, was consecrated in October 1934. Its apse has five stained glass windows by Francis Spear, installed in 1947.
In the event, St David's continued to be used for public services. The Church of the Resurrection is now in its own Parish of Glan Ely. St David's remained in the parish of Caerau as a daughter church, even though St Mary's was becoming increasingly rundown. An additional church, St Timothy's, was founded in 1957 in response to the growing urbanisation and the poor condition of St Mary's. In 1973, St Mary's closed and St David's became the parish church.
Listing.
The Church became listed in 2001.

Barossa Goldfields, South Australia

Barossa Goldfields is a locality in South Australia. It is on the southwestern side of the Barossa Council, bounded on the southwest by the South Para River. The locality is now essentially rural, but is named for the gold mining and prospecting in the second half of the nineteenth century in the area, on the creeks descending to the South Para River. Part of that area is now preserved as part of the Para Wirra Recreation Park. A total of 778 kg of gold was produced in the area.
Gold was discovered in October 1868 by Job Harris, a publican at Sandy Creek. Within the first week, 2000 people had rushed to the area and 4000 within a few weeks. The town of Barossa was established and survived until the 1950s. A second town of Victoria was established in 1869. By late 1870, the rush had subsided and only 100 miners remained with others having moved on to other fields. There were resurgences in 1887 and 1889 and companies formed to dig for deeper gold leads. None of the companies was successful, despite constructing a large gold battery and tramways to supply it. Alluvial deposits were reworked during the 1930s depression.

Island City Historic District

The Island City Historic District is a primarily commercial historic district which encompass the whole of the island on which stands the central part of Eaton Rapids, Michigan. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012.
History.
The Eaton Rapids area was first settled in 1836, when a sawmill was built about two miles from what is now downtown Eaton Rapids. By 1836, a group of investors had built a dam on Spring Brook in Eaton Rapids, started work on a race, and built a grist mill. The village was first platted, and by 1837/38, houses had been built. In 1840 a considerably larger race was built, along with a sawmill and factory buildings. In 1842, the South Feeder Race that defines what is now the island was cut through. The settlement grew rapidly over the next forty years, spurred by the mills, surrounding agriculture, and the discovery of mineral springs in the area in the 1860s.
In fact, a number of mills and other industries were established along the Eaton Rapids races with in the district, starting in 1840. In 1880 Samuel Horner purchased an already existing woolen mill and brokered it into a very successful venture. He constructed a number of factory and mill buildings now located in the northern part of the district, and his companies flourished into the 1950s. As the mills expanded, so did the commercial ventures in Eaton Rapids. By the early 1860s, there were multiple grocers, shoe stores, hardware stores, and dry goods stores, as well as liveries, milliners, and other establishments. A fire in 1864 destroyed half of the buildings downtown, and major fires in 1874 and 1877 destroyed much of the rest. In response, in 1881 a Fireman's Hall was constructed to house the village's fire station.
Description.
The Island City Historic District contains 139 buildings, sites, structures and objects, of which 92 contribute to the historic character of the district. Most of these are buildings, but mill races, bridges, and parks also contribute to the historic nature of the area. The district encompasses Eaton Rapids' central business district, and is bounded by the Grand River and several mill races that create the island itself. Although the district is primarily commercial, some industrial, residential, and institutional structures are located within the boundaries. The streets in the district are generally in a grid, with wide sidewalks and buildings set back about 15 feet.
The primarily commercial buildings in the heart of the district are between one and four storefronts in width and one to three stories in height. At the northern section of the district are industrial buildings such as the former Homer Mill complex. At the southern end are the visually distinctive First Congregational Church soars alongside the Red Ribbon Hall, a significant cultural anchor of the community. The district also includes a post office, old residences, and school buildings. Architectural styles in the district range from Gothic Revival, and Second Empire structures to later Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, Colonial Revival, and Neoclassical structures, to twentieth century Commercial Brick and Craftsman/Bungalow styles.
Significant structures in the district include:

Alger-class cruiser

The "Alger" class comprised three protected cruisers of the French Navy built in the late 1880s and early 1890s; the three ships were , , and . They were ordered as part of a fleet program that accorded with the theories of the , which proposed a fleet based on cruisers and torpedo boats to defend France. The "Alger"-class cruisers were intended to serve a long-range commerce raiders to attack enemy merchant shipping. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns supported by six guns and they had a top speed of .
After entering service, "Alger" and "Isly" were assigned to the Northern Squadron, while "Jean Bart" operated with the Mediterranean Squadron until 1895, when she, too, joined the Northern Squadron. That year, "Alger" and "Isly" were sent to French Indochina, and they were followed by "Jean Bart" followed in 1898. By that time, "Alger" had returned to France to serve in the Mediterranean. "Jean Bart" was present in the Far East during the Boxer Uprising in Qing China the following year, by which time "Isly" had been transferred to the North Atlantic station. "Alger" embarked on a second tour in East Asia in the mid-1900s, though records of when she left France are unclear. "Jean Bart" was wrecked off the coast of the Western Sahara in 1907 and could not be refloated. "Isly" was converted into a depot ship in 1909 and "Alger" was hulked in 1911; the former was sold to ship breakers in 1914, but "Alger" remained in the French Navy's inventory until 1939.
Design.
By 1886, Admiral Théophile Aube had become the French Minister of Marine. Aube was an ardent supporter of the doctrine, which envisioned using a combination of cruisers and torpedo boats to defend France and attack enemy merchant shipping. By the time Aube had come to office, the French Navy had laid down three large protected cruisers that were intended to serve as commerce raiders: , , and . His proposed budget called for another six large cruisers and ten smaller vessels, but by the time it was approved later in 1886, it had been modified to three large cruisers, two medium cruisers, and six small cruisers. The three "Alger"s filled the requirement for the large vessels, and they proved to be the last of the large commerce-raiding cruisers built for the French fleet ordered by Aube. The French Navy would later return to the idea with and in the late 1890s.
General characteristics and machinery.
The ships of the "Alger" class were long between perpendiculars and long at the waterline, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced . Their hulls featured a pronounced ram bow and a tumblehome shape, along with a sloped, overhanging stern. The ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting primarily of a small conning tower and bridge forward. Their crew varied over the course of their careers, amounting to 387–405 officers and enlisted men.
Reports of the ships' rigging are mixed; according to "Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships", the cruisers carried a pair of heavy military masts fitted with fighting tops for some of their light guns and observation positions. But in an article in "Warship International" quoting the 1905 edition of the "Marine Almanac", Fisher states that the vessels were originally barque rigged, the sails being removed by the mid-1890s. An 1893 article in the "Scientific American Supplement", using an illustration from the French newspaper "L'Illustration", depicts "Alger" with military masts.
The ship's propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines for "Alger" and horizontal triple-expansion engines for "Jean Bart" and "Isly", driving two screw propellers in all three vessels. Steam was provided by twenty-four coal-burning Belleville type water-tube boilers for "Alger", while "Jean Bart" and "Isly" received eight of the older fire-tube boilers. Each ships' boilers were ducted into two funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . Normal coal storage amounted to , but up to could be carried. This permitted a cruising radius of at with the normal load, and at the same speed with the maximum.
Armament and armor.
The ships were armed with a main battery of four 28-caliber guns and six 30-cal. guns. All of these guns were placed in individual pivot mounts on the upper deck; the 164 mm guns were in sponsons located fore and aft, with two guns per broadside. Four of the 138 mm guns were in sponsons between the 164 mm guns, one was in an embrasure in the forecastle and the last was in a swivel mount on the stern. The 138 mm guns were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid cast iron projectiles and explosive armor-piercing shells, both of which weighed . The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of . 
For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried a pair of 9-pounder guns, eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, and eight Hotchkiss revolver cannon. They were also armed with five torpedo tubes in their hull above the waterline.
Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, increasing in thickness to on the sides, where it curved down to meet the sides of the hull. Above the deck, the ships had a wide cofferdam that was extensively compartmentalized to control flooding in the event of damage above the deck. The ships had plating on the conning tower. "Isly" and "Jean Bart" received gun shields that were 50 mm thick; these were fitted to the 164 and 138 mm guns.
Service history.
"Alger" served with the Northern Squadron early in her career, where she took part in routine peacetime training exercises. "Isly" joined her there as part of the Reserve Division, being activated only for maneuvers with the unit. "Jean Bart", meanwhile, initially served with the Mediterranean Squadron before being transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1895. That year, "Alger" and "Isly" were deployed to French Indochina; the latter briefly returned to France the following year before embarking on another deployment to the Far East in 1897 to relieve "Alger". After returning home, "Alger" served with the Mediterranean Squadron while "Jean Bart" was modernized and had her heavy military masts removed.
"Jean Bart" joined "Isly" in Indochina in 1898, though the latter was reassigned to the North Atlantic station in 1899. "Jean Bart" was part of the French fleet that responded to the Boxer Uprising in Qing China later that year. "Alger" had been reduced to reserve by 1901, and in May that year, "Jean Bart" was recalled home, where she was also placed in reserve. In 1902, "Isly" had new water-tube boilers installed. "Jean Bart" was similarly modified between 1903 and 1906. Reports conflict over "Alger"s activities in the mid-1900s; contemporary reports place her in the Mediterranean for fleet maneuvers, but later historians state the ship was on a second tour in East Asia from 1905. Both agree that "Alger" served in Asian waters as late as 1908.
In the meantime, "Jean Bart" had run aground off the Western Sahara in early 1907 and could not be refloated. In 1908, "Isly" was briefly sent to French Morocco, and the following year she was converted into a depot ship for destroyers. "Alger" was similarly reduced to a storage hulk in 1911, while "Isly" was struck from the naval register in 1914 and thereafter broken up. "Alger" survived in the fleet's inventory until 1939, when she, too, was sold to ship breakers.

Amphitrope

Amphitrope () was a minor coastal ("paralia") deme of ancient Attica, belonging to the Antiochis tribe ("phyle"), with two representatives in the Boule.
It was situated in the valley of Legrena, between mount Baphi to the west and mount Spitharopussi to the east, close to the modern settlement of Synterina (Συντερίνα, ), neighboring the demes of Atene to the west, Sounion to the east and Thorikos to the north-east, on the border between the modern Saronikos and Lavreotiki municipalities.
It was one of the smaller demes of the Mines of Laurion district, with eight or nine mines.
According to Aeschines ("Against Timarchus" 101), the father of Timarchus had possessions in Amphitrope which he was forced to sell to pay to cover the expenses of the liturgy.
The site of Amphitrope is tentatively located at Pousipelia Megalo Peuka.

Oberburg, Kobern

The Oberburg at Kobern, also called the "Oberburg" or "Altenburg", is a hill castle above the municipality of Kobern-Gondorf in the county of Mayen-Koblenz in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
Location.
The ruins of the Oberburg ("Upper Castle") stand at a height of about 200 metres above the village of Kobern on a hill ridge that points towards the Moselle. On the same ridge and about 50 metres lower, is the Niederburg ("Lower Castle").
Description.
Apart from the Late Romanesque St. Matthias' Chapel and the "bergfried" little other than a few remains of the enceinte have survived. The castle has a rectangular ground plan and measures about 110 by 40 metres. The ground and upper storey of the roughly 9 by 9 metre, square "bergfried" are vaulted. Access to the second floor is via a staircase in the wall.
The building attached to the "bergfried" was built in 1989.
History.
The castle was built in the early 12th century on a Celtic hillfort site. It is first recorded in 1195, when the then "Burgherr" made it a fiefdom of the Electorate of Trier.
St. Matthias' Chapel was built about 1220/40 by Lord Henry II of Isenburg, in order to serve as a reliquary for the head of Saint Matthias. The castle area was increased in size when the chapel was built. It used the choir of a previous structure, which was probably not finished.
The lords of Isenburg-Kobern held the castle until the mid-14th century. It was then sold to the Archbishop of Trier and fell into ruin.
In 1936, the "bergfried" was covered by an temporary roof to protect it from further decay. From 1989, a restaurant was built next to the "bergfried" on a site that had been built on before. As part of the work, the "bergfried" was increased in height and given a new roof.
Visiting.
The castle is open to the public all year round and may be visited free of charge. There is a restaurant in the "bergfried" and adjacent buildings. St. Matthias' Chapel can be visited at summer weekends. There is an ascent to the castle up a narrow footpath, the "Kreuzweg", through the vineyards, from the Mühlbach valley. There is also a car par immediately below the castle.
Protected monument.
The Oberburg is a protected cultural monument.

Atene (deme)

Atene () was a coastal ("paralia") deme of Attica, belonging to the Antiochis tribe ("phyle"), with three representatives in the Boule.
It bordered Anaphlystus to the north and Amphitrope in the east, in what is now the southern part of Saronikos municipality.
It had an area of about 20 km2, including the valleys of Charaka, Hagia Photini and Thimari as well as Gaidouronisi.
The area had been mostly uninhabited prior to the 5th century BC. The first epigraphic mention of Atene dates to 432 BC.
It prospered during the 5th to 4th centuries BC, with a dispersed settlement pattern,
but was depopulated in the 3rd century BC, probably in the wake of the Chremonidean War.

Asian American and Pacific Islands American conservatism in the United States

Asian Americans and Pacific Islands Americans have given fluctuating levels of support to conservative movements and political parties in the United States, particularly the Republican Party. Many Republican Party members with these origins have obtained posts as elected representatives and political appointments as office holders.
Voting trends.
From the 1940s to the 1990s most Asian Americans were anti-communist refugees who had fled mainland China, North Korea or Vietnam, and were strongly anti-Communist. Many had ties to conservative organizations. In recent years, more liberal Asian-American groups such as newer Chinese and Indian immigrants have greatly changed the Asian-American political demographics, as well as a larger proportion of younger Asian Americans, many of whom have completed college degrees.
During the 1990s and 2000s, Asian American voting behavior shifted from moderate support for the Republican Party to stronger support for the Democratic Party. In the 1992 presidential election Republican George H. W. Bush received 55% of the Asian-American vote compared to 31% for Democrat Bill Clinton. Asian Americans voted Republican and were the only racial group more conservative than whites in the 1990s, according to surveys. By the 2004 election, Democrat John Kerry won 56% of the Asian American vote, with Chinese and Indian Americans tending to support Kerry, and Vietnamese and Filipino Americans tending to support George Bush. Japanese-Americans leaned towards Kerry, while Korean-Americans leaned towards Bush. Democrat Barack Obama won 62% of the Asian American vote in the 2008 presidential election, with the margin increasing during the 2012 presidential election, where Asian Americans voted to re-elect Obama by 73%. In the 2014 midterm elections, based on exit polls, 50% of Asian Americans voted Republican, while 49% voted Democrat; this swing towards voting for Republicans was a shift from the strong Democratic vote in 2012, and had not reached 50% since 1996. The 2016 National Asian American Survey, conducted before the 2016 presidential election, found that 55% of Asian American registered voters supported Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and only 14% supported Republican candidate Donald Trump.
Despite their growing trend of voting for Democrats in national elections, Asian Americans have tended to identify as independents and have not developed strong ties to political parties as a group. Due to the smaller size of the groups population, in comparison to the population as a whole, it has been difficult to get an adequate sampling to forecast voter outcomes for Asian Americans. In 2008, polls indicated that 35% considered themselves non-partisan, 32% Democrats, 19% independents, and 14% Republicans. The 2012 National Asian American Survey found that 51% considered themselves non-partisan, 33% Democrats, 14% Republicans, and 2% Other; Hmong, Indian, and Korean Americans strongly identified as Democrats, and Filipino and Vietnamese Americans most strongly identified as Republicans. In 2013, according to the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, Chinese Americans were the least likely Asian American ethnicity to have a party affiliation, with only one third belonging to a party. The 2016 National Asian American Survey found that 41% of Asian Americans identified as non-partisan, 41% as Democrats (a modest increase from 2008 and 2012), and 16% as Republicans.
Neither the Republican nor Democratic parties have financed significant efforts to the registration of Asian Americans, however much more attention has been focused on contributions from Asian Americans, having once been referred to as potential "Republican Jews". As recently as 2006, the outreach efforts of America's two major political parties have been unbalanced, with the Democratic Party devoting more resources in attracting Asian Americans. In 2016, a majority of Asian-Americans possessed the same political views on racial profiling, education, social security, and immigration reform as the Democratic Party; the efforts to attract Asian-Americans has produced a proportionally significant growth in Democratic affiliation by Asian-Americans from 2012 to 2016 by 12 percent. Political affiliation aside, Asian Americans have trended to become more politically active as a whole, with 2008 seeing an increase of voter participation by 4% to a 49% voting rate.

This is a timeline of significant events in Asian history which have shaped the conservative movement in the United States.

Palace of Spain

The Palace of Spain () or Monaldeschi Palace is a baroque palace that houses the Embassy of Spain to the Holy See since 1647. It does not lodge, on the other hand, the Embassy of Spain in Italy, since this one is in the first floor of the Borghese Palace of Rome.
Origins.
The Embassy of Spain to the Holy See is the oldest embassy in the world. It was created in 1480 by King Ferdinand the Catholic, being its first ambassador Gonzalo de Beteta, knight of the Order of Santiago.
Among the political results of this diplomatic activity are the papal support for the Reconquest of Granada, the sharing of the New World between Spain and Portugal through the "Bull Inter Caetera" in 1493 (see Treaty of Tordesillas), the Holy League for the fight against the Turk culminating in the victory of Lepanto in 1571, among others.
Monaldeschi Palace: headquarters of the Embassy of Spain.
The Spanish ambassadors had rented the Monaldeschi Palace for more than a decade. In 1647, the new ambassador, Íñigo Vélez de Guevara, 8th Count of Oñate, made an offer for the palace, owned by the Monaldeschi Family, an old Roman noble family, through an Italian agent, Bernardino Barber, and later obtained the permission of purchase of the Congregation of Barons of the Pontifical State, that had the power to approve the sale of important palaces. Barber bought it for 22,000 Roman scudos and was immediately transferred to the Count of Oñate. Soon after, four other houses next to the palace were bought to expand the building.
In 1654, the palace was acquired by the Spanish crown as a permanent residence for ambassadors. King Philip IV sent 19,000 ducats for maintenance and repair.
Located in the famous Piazza di Spagna (Spain's Square), in the historic center of Rome, a square that in fact takes its name from the Palace. The area of land occupied by the palace is 3589 m² (38 632 sq ft) with 11 000 m² (118 403 sq ft) of construction between plants and terraces that constitute one of the most beautiful and rich architectural works of the time.
Borromini designed the palace extension and traced the main staircase of the embassy and the lobby. The architect Antonio Del Grande (1625 - 1671) was the one who continued with the works. Between 1827 and 1834 Neoclassical and Pompeian decorations were introduced and a small wooden theater where Vittorio Alfieri premiered his "Antigone" on November 20, 1782, disappeared from the ballroom.
During the 17th and 18th centuries the palace was the center of a lavish and lively world of festivities that also animated the Piazza di Spagna, the scene of the most brilliant events of its time, public spectacles sponsored by the Spanish ambassador.
The embassy houses a collection of gobelin tapestries of the 17th century that belonged to the Bourbon-Orleans family from the Galliera Palace in Bologna, with Roman and biblical motifs. The walls of the formal dining room are adorned with three splendid woolen and silk tapestries from the 18th century, originating from the Royal Palace of Madrid, representing scenes from the life of Telemachus, according to cartons drawn by Rubens.
The halls have the presence of paintings of the Prado Museum of illustrious authors such as Federico Madrazo, Vicente López, Nattier, Mengs, Mario Nuzzi, among others. Among the sculptures stand out two busts by Gianlorenzo Bernini of 1619, "El alma beata" and "El alma condenada".
On September 8, 1857, Pope Pius IX inaugurated the Column of the Immaculate Conception that presides over the Piazza di Spagna in memory of the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate of which Spain was a tenacious defender for centuries.

Phrearrhii

Phrearrhii or Phrearrhioi or Phrearroi () was a deme of the coastal ("paralia") region of ancient Attica, belonging to the Leontis tribe ("phyle"), with nine to ten representatives in the "Boule".
It was situated roughly 30 km (20 mi) south-east of Athens, bordering the deme of Anaphlystos to the south-west, just north of Attic Olympus, close to modern Pheriza (Φέριζα), in the Lavreotiki municipality.
The Athenian statesman Themistocles was a native of Phrearrhioi.
Its site is located east of modern Olymbos.

MV Sinar Kudus hijacking

The MV "Sinar Kudus" hijacking was a maritime event that began on 16 March 2011 with four pirates in the Indian Ocean seizing the cargo ship MV "Sinar Kudus" east of Somali coast. The siege ended after a rescue effort by the Indonesian Navy on 1 May 2011. It was the first pirate seizure of an Indonesian merchant ship off the Somali coast.
Background.
On 16 March 2011, an Indonesian merchant ship, MV "Sinar Kudus", was carrying nickel ore from South Sulawesi to Rotterdam when it was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Red Sea. After negotiations, the ship owner agreed to a ransom demand and restored the ship and crew to Indonesian authorities. It was then hijacked a second time by another group of pirates; after signalling "mayday" the ship's crew were supported by a group of Denjaka and Kopassus from KRI "Abdul Halim Perdanakusuma" which secured the ship. A further group of Denjaka and Kopassus were deployed using a Bo 105 helicopter to strafe the pirates, all of whom were killed.

Sonder (album)

Sonder is the fourth studio album by English progressive metal band, Tesseract. It was released on 20 April 2018 through Kscope, following "Polaris" (2015).
Tesseract began recording the album in 2017, releasing its first single, "Smile", on 23 June, with the intention of reworking it for "Sonder". The album's lead single, "Luminary", was released on 8 February 2018, the same day the album was announced. It is notably the band's first full-length release to not feature a lineup change from the previous album.
Background.
"Sonder" marks Tesseract's second consecutive release and third overall with the original vocalist, Daniel Tompkins, who first appeared on their debut studio album, "One" (2011), and later, "Polaris". A concept album, "Sonder" was described by Tompkins as "exploring a deep and devouring sense of insignificance". "Smile" was released by the band on 23 June 2017, and was described as their "most collaborative track in recent times", but was intended to be reworked and extended for the album.
The album was originally announced on 8 February 2018, with the simultaneous release of its lead single, "Luminary", and the music video for "King" (directed by Kyle Kadow and Steven Cleavland in Wisconsin) being released on 16 March. For the first time, the band acquired the talents of a choir, produced and conducted by Randy Slaugh of White Moth Black Butterfly and recorded at Soularium Studios in the U.S. 
 "Sonder" is the band's shortest studio album at 36 minutes in length.
The inspiration for the album's name came from a fictional word used in "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows".

Catherine Lynch

Catherine Lynch (1880 – 19 October 1908), née Catherine Driscoll, also known as Kate Driscoll, was a petty criminal from Swansea, Wales. Following the death of her father in an industrial accident in 1900, Driscoll took up employment as a domestic servant to a local publican's family. She rapidly descended into crime and alcoholism, and over the next few years was regularly convicted of prostitution, theft, and alcohol-related public order offences. She married in 1906, becoming Catherine Lynch, and although her criminal activity appears to have fallen somewhat following her marriage she continued drinking heavily.
In October 1908, at the age of 28, she collapsed and died at home while preparing to go out for the evening. A subsequent inquest attributed her death to a syncope induced by alcohol. The presiding coroner was harshly critical of her, describing her as "one of a class who were a nuisance to themselves, their husbands and everybody else" and as symptomatic of an increase in drunkenness among Swansea's women. He was also critical of her husband John Lynch for having continued to support her despite her alcoholism, instead of having taken the opportunity to have her incarcerated.
In her lifetime, Lynch attracted little notice beyond official records and local newspaper accounts. Her life was examined by local historian Elizabeth Belcham in her book "Swansea's 'Bad Girls': Crime and Prostitution 1870s–1914".
Early life.
Catherine Driscoll's father Jeremiah Driscoll had emigrated from County Cork to work in the Cwmfelin Tin Plate Works in Cwmbwrla. He married Mary Ellen Sheehan in Swansea in 1876; Catherine was born in Swansea in 1880, the third of the Driscolls' eight children. A drunkard with a history of convictions for brawling and public drunkenness, Jeremiah lived with his wife, children, parents and sister in a single house in Skinner Street, Swansea, later moving to a larger house in Baptist Well Street.
On 7 May 1900 Jeremiah Driscoll was involved in a serious industrial accident. Preparing to ride on a steam crane, he was waiting on the tracks of the crane as it approached, intending to sit on the crane's cab. He mistimed his sitting down, and sat in front of the oncoming crane. The crane's driver, who was positioned at the rear of the crane, was unable to see Driscoll sitting on the tracks, and consequently did not stop. Jeremiah Driscoll sustained a crushed right foot, a broken spine, facial injuries and two broken ribs. He was immediately taken to hospital but died shortly afterwards. His injuries were described as "hopeless from the first", and the coroner's jury ruled that his death was purely accidental.
Adult life.
With the family's breadwinner gone, Catherine, now commonly known as Kate, took a job as a domestic servant to a Swansea publican and his family in 1901. She soon turned to crime; she first appeared in court charged with indecency in May 1903. In June 1904, she was described in court for the first time as a prostitute; her conviction on this occasion was for the public use of obscene language, an offence for which she would be repeatedly prosecuted that year.
By the following year, Driscoll was descending into alcoholism, and on 20 March 1905 she was sentenced to 14 days' hard labour following repeated convictions for being drunk and disorderly. This did little to reduce her criminal activities; on 19 August 1905 she was again sentenced to 14 days' hard labour for "riotous behaviour in Castle-street". On 17 November 1905 she was arrested, along with her friends Selina Rushbrook and Lily Argent, for the theft of a sea captain's purse. (By this time Driscoll had been convicted of indecency, obscene language, four counts of drunkenness and two counts of being a disorderly prostitute.) Although all three were found not guilty on grounds of insufficient evidence, days later Driscoll was convicted yet again of drunkenness, and sentenced to a month's imprisonment.
The increasing severity of her sentences did not deter Driscoll; within days of her release from this sentence she was arrested yet again for riotous behaviour. The case against her was adjourned as she "pleaded that she was willing to go to St. Joseph's Convent". She does not appear to have taken advantage of the leniency of the court; less than a month later, yet another charge of rioting was abandoned by the prosecutor "as she is now serving a term of imprisonment on another charge". Following this sentence Driscoll appears to have evaded the attention of the authorities for a time, her sole court appearance being an allegation of the theft of £4 (about £ in terms) from a sailor with whom she had made a "promiscuous acquaintance", but she was released without charge when it transpired that she had no money on her at the time of her arrest.
In August 1906 Kate Driscoll married John Lynch, and settled with him at 96 Mitchell Row, Swansea. Although she continued drinking, she appears to have given up criminal activity for a time, and she did not come to the attention of the authorities for the remainder of 1906. This did not last; in May 1907 she was once again sentenced to a month's imprisonment, this time for the theft of a purse and four shillings.
John and Catherine Lynch subsequently moved to 6 Michael's Row in the Greenhill district of central Swansea. Catherine Lynch's descent into alcoholism and crime continued, and in June 1908 she yet again was prosecuted, on this occasion for the theft of three half-crowns (about £ in terms) from a coal miner who had been "in the woman's company". (Lynch denied being with him, telling the court that "I don't go with a dirty little scamp like that".) It was noted that Lynch by now had 41 previous convictions, and she was sentenced to two months' imprisonment.
Death.
On the evening of 19 October 1908, aged 28, Catherine Lynch was "preparing to go out to a place of amusement". She was washing her face and hands in her Michael's Row home, when she went to sit on the stairs. At 7.15 p.m. she suddenly fell backwards. John Lynch tried to give her a drink of water but she was unable to drink it; he carried her upstairs to bed, and summoned a doctor. Upon Dr Jones Powell's arrival he found her dead in bed. Jones Powell attributed her death to syncope (fainting) induced by alcoholism.
At the coroner's inquest, John Lynch testified that Catherine had been drunk at the time. Challenged by the coroner as to why he had allowed her to drink herself into such a condition, John stated that she had been an alcoholic for as long as he had known her, and that he felt obliged to give her money for drink as "if I didn't she used to take it off me". Mr. Leeder, the coroner, challenged John Lynch, advising him that he should have contacted the police and have her "put away", stating that this would have been "cheaper than allowing her to ruin the home". Leeder was unsympathetic to Catherine Lynch, describing her as "one of a class who were a nuisance to themselves, their husbands and everybody else". He considered Lynch's death as part of a pattern of increasing drunkenness among women in Swansea, observing that "one woman led others to drink, for she would not drink by herself" and "when one of these women went wrong she dragged six others with her". In line with Jones Powell's testimony, the jury returned a verdict of "death from syncope brought on by excessive drinking". She was buried in Danygraig cemetery on 23 October 1908.

Occult fracture

An occult fracture is a fracture that is not readily visible, generally in regard to projectional radiography ("X-ray"). Radiographically, occult and subtle fractures are a diagnostic challenge. They may be divided into 1) high energy trauma fracture, 2) fatigue fracture from cyclical and sustained mechanical stress, and 3) insufficiency fracture occurring in weakened bone (e.g., in osteoporosis and postradiotherapy). Independently of the cause, the initial radiographic examination can be negative either because the findings seem normal or are too subtle. Advanced imaging tools such as computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and scintigraphy are highly valuable in the early detection of these fractures.
Fractures represent up to 80% of the missed diagnoses in the emergency department. Failure to recognize the subtle signs of osseous injury is one of the reasons behind this major diagnostic challenge. While occult fractures present no radiographic findings, radiographically subtle fractures are easily overlooked on initial radiographs. In both cases, a negative radiographic diagnosis with prominent clinical suspicion of osseous injury will prompt advanced imaging examination such as CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and nuclear medicine to confirm or exclude the clinically suspected diagnosis. The burden entailed in missing these fractures includes prolonged pain with a loss of function, and disability. Early detection, on the other hand, enables more effective treatment, a shorter hospitalization period if necessary, and decreased medical costs in the long run. It will also prevent inherent complications such as nonunion, malunion, premature osteoarthritis, and avascular osteonecrosis (as in scaphoid fracture). Of the three types of occult fractures mentioned above, the latter two, fatigue fracture secondary to repetitive and unusual stress being applied to bone with normal elastic resistance, and insufficiency fracture resulting from normal or minimal stress on a bone with decreased elastic resistance are also described as "stress fractures".
These fractures are often a challenging diagnostic problem in daily clinical practice. Radiologists should be aware of the different situations and mechanisms of these injuries as well as the subtle radiographic signs that can be encountered in each situation. The knowledge of normal images and the consideration of the clinical context are of great value in improving the detection of these fractures either on conventional radiographs or with more advanced imaging tools.
Imaging tools.
Thanks to rapid technological advancement, new and more efficient imaging hardware is constantly released for all imaging modalities including CT, MRI, nuclear medicine, and ultrasound.
Projectional radiography.
Radiography is the first step for detection of fractures. The detection of subtle signs of fracture requires a high standard for the acquisition technique and a thorough and systematic interpretation of radiographic images. Correct diagnosis primarily relies on the reader's experience. Awareness of normal anatomic features is crucial for the interpreter to be able to detect subtle signs of fracture. Fat pads should be carefully examined for convexity, which implies joint effusion (e.g., in the hip and elbow). However, the radiographic technique (positioning in particular) must be optimal for this evaluation to be valid. Osseous lines should be checked for integrity (e.g., acetabular rim in the hip). Trabecular angulation, impaction lines, and sclerotic bands also suggest fracture in osseous structures with a significant proportion of cancellous bone such as proximal femur.
The general rule is to perform two orthogonal views, but more specific views should be added if there is any suspicion of fracture. Moreover, one should be aware of the commonly encountered lesions and their locations. In wrist trauma, for instance, the interpreter should pay close attention to the scaphoid and triquetrum, which are the two most commonly injured carpal bones. The mechanism of trauma may also be helpful to locate the potential fracture. A fall on an outstretched hand suggests scaphoid fracture. Although the classical presentation consists of a radiolucent line and cortical disruption, the radiographic signs will depend upon the time elapsed between the first clinical symptoms and the time of radiographic examination, the location of the fracture within the bone, and the ratio of cortical to cancellous bone. Particular attention should be paid when analysing the subchondral plate, which may be disrupted or deformed. In metaphyseal areas, delayed signs of fracture include a band of sclerosis perpendicular to the trabeculae, while diaphyseal fractures may present as periosteal thickening.
Digital radiography known as tomosynthesis has been shown to be superior to conventional radiographs in the detection of occult fracture of the scaphoid. Tomosynthesis has the ability to demonstrate cortical, as well as moderately displaced trabecular fractures. Thus, the performance of tomosynthesis in detecting radiographically occult fractures is considered as comparable to CT.
Computed Tomography.
Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is a highly valuable imaging tool for the diagnosis of occult fractures. CT has several advantages including short acquisition time (compared to MRI), the ability to acquire volumetric and isotropic image data sets, the opportunity to reconstruct multiplanar reformations in any arbitrary plane, and excellent spatial resolution. Moreover, the image quality for multiplanar reconstruction may be increased by reducing slice thickness and acquisition pitch. In general, bony structures are best demonstrated by using a small focal spot and using a "bone" algorithm. CT contributes much to the diagnosis of occult fractures by depicting subtle fracture lines, depressed, or distracted articular surfaces and by assessing bone loss It also detects late bony changes such as increased medullary density, endosteal sclerosis, sclerotic lines in trabecular bone, and periosteal thickening. Moreover, CT aids in excluding other differential diagnoses, especially in case of isolated bone marrow edema, by confirming the normal appearance of the remaining trabeculae and excluding space-occupying lesions such as malignancy and osteomyelitis.
Newest generation of CT, such as dedicated cone-beam CT (CBCT) system for musculoskeletal extremities, may be beneficial in various conditions, such as arthritis and occult fractures. Although dedicated CBCT for musculoskeletal extremities is still a matter of research, it has been shown to be of potential benefit as an adjunct for CT and MRI. It offers the possibility of volumetric imaging, which may be helpful in case of suspected occult fractures. It also provides higher spatial resolution and a potentially reduced dose compared to CT.
Magnetic resonance imaging.
The diagnostic performance of MRI in the detection of occult fractures has been shown to be comparable, or better than MDCT. Indeed, while the specificity of both CT and MRI for the diagnosis of fracture can be as high as 100%, the sensitivity was reported to be higher for MRI. The superiority of MRI over any other imaging modality including MDCT for the detection of occult hip fractures is now recognised. For instance, an occult intertrochanteric extension of a greater trochanter fracture can be most effectively appreciated on MRI Moreover, MRI is extremely helpful in detecting associated soft tissue abnormalities, especially ligamentous lesions. MRI is now considered as the standard in this context. However, because of its relative unavailability in emergency settings and high costs, MRI may only be performed in "high risk patients" with negative X-rays. For example, when a hip occult fracture is suspected, patients with reduced baseline mobility and pain on axial compression are considered at risk and, therefore, should be examined by MRI. MRI signs of occult fractures are evident several weeks before radiographic signs appear. In the hip, a limited and cost-effective MR protocol, with only T1 weighted () coronal images, may enable a reliable diagnosis or exclusion of occult fracture in very little time, for example, 7 minutes. Typically, a linear hypointensity is observed on T1 W images. MRI is also highly sensitive to marrow abnormalities surrounding the fracture line, which appear as hypointensity on T1 W images and hyperintensity on fluid-sensitive sequences. Such signal changes are thought to be a combination of bone marrow edema, intraosseous haemorrhage, and/or granulation tissue and help to identify even undisplaced fractures. However, in the absence of a history of trauma and linear hypointensities on T1 W images, isolated bone marrow edema may represent other pathologies such as osteoid osteoma and sclerosing osteomyelitis.
Although 1.5 T and 3 T MR is considered as the current gold standard for the detection of radiographically occult fractures, ultra-high field MR provide higher signal-to-noise ratio and, therefore, is expected to be superior to 1.5 T and 3 T. Ultra-high field MR seems to be promising in the diagnosis of a variety of musculoskeletal conditions including trauma, but it is not used in daily routine yet.
Nuclear medicine.
The most traditional method is bone scintigraphy. Although scintigraphy is highly sensitive for the detection of occult fracture, its lack of specificity limits its diagnostic utility. However, when MRI is not available, scintigraphy may be of value, especially in the absence of trauma history, for example, for detection of insufficiency and fatigue fractures. While radiography may show only late signs of bone reaction (such as periosteal thickening and band of sclerosis), scintigraphic examination allows for earlier detection of bony changes. Regarding Fluorine-18 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), it is critical to be aware that occult fractures may be responsible of marked metabolic uptake, and, thus, represent a potential false positive of metastatic disease. Integrated hybrid single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT)/CT combines the detection of abnormal bone metabolism with SPECT, to the precise anatomical detail provided by high resolution CT. For instance, SPECT/CT may be interesting in the detection of radiographic occult fractures of the wrist and other sport-related injuries.
Ultrasonography.
High frequency ultrasound has been shown to be of value, particularly in the pediatric population. In this case, and in an emergency setting, ultrasonography can be more accessible and less time-consuming than radiographs and has high specificity and sensitivity in the evaluation of suspected long bone fractures. The utility of ultrasonography has also been shown for adults with suspicion of wrist trauma or fatigue/stress fracture. Recently, it has been suggested that therapeutic ultrasound may be beneficial as a primary evaluation of bone stress injury; however, its benefit seems to be more evident in selected high-risk patients rather than general population.
High-energy trauma fractures.
Occult osseous injuries may result from a direct blow to the bone by compressive forces of adjacent bones against one another or by traction forces during an avulsion injury. Lesions in the tibial plateau, hip, ankle, and wrist are often missed. In a tibial plateau fracture, any disruption of the posterior and anterior cortical rims of the plateau should be sought. Impaction of subchondral bone will appear as an increased sclerosis of the subchondral bone (Figure 1). In the hip, posterior acetabular fractures also present subtle radiographic findings. The acetabular lines should then be carefully examined keeping in mind that the posterior rim, which is harder to see on X-rays, is more frequently fractured than the anterior rim (Figure 2). In the wrist, detection of carpal bone fractures is often challenging, with up to 18% of scaphoid fractures radiographically occult. Carpal fractures, especially the scaphoid, are associated with the risk of avascular necrosis. In apparently normal wrist radiographs from symptomatic patients, if there is history of a fall on an outstretched hand with pain in the anatomic snuffbox, suggesting scaphoid injury, the initial examination with posteroanterior, lateral, and pronation oblique views must be complemented by other specific views such as supination oblique and the "scaphoid" view A careful examination of cortices for evidence of discontinuity or offset and cancellous bone for lucency is necessary (Figure 3).
Figure 1: A 56-year-old woman presenting with left knee pain after a fall. (a) Initial anteroposterior radiograph was considered normal, however, subtle cortical disruption of the anterior rim of the medial tibial plateau, medial to the tibial spine, is noted (arrow). (b) Coronal T1-weighted MRI confirms the cortical disruption (arrow) and shows extensive fracture through the proximal tibia. (c) Coronal proton density-weighted image with fat saturation shows extensive edema in the subchondral bone. Note also hypersignal adjacent to the medial collateral ligament corresponding to a grade I sprain (arrowheads).
Figure 3: A 26-year-old man presenting with wrist pain after being assaulted. (a) Initial anteroposterior radiograph shows a subtle linear lucency within the scaphoid extending to the scaphocapitate articular surface that was overlooked (arrow). (b) Initial "scaphoid" view was negative. (c) Followup anteroposterior radiographs, 12 days later, shows obvious scaphoid fracture (arrows).
Triquetral fracture usually occurs on the dorsal aspect by impingement from the ulnar styloid or avulsion of strong ligamentous attachment. The dorsal avulsion fracture or "chip fracture" appears as a small bony fragment on the dorsal aspect of the triquetrum and is best detected on the lateral view(Figure 4). When radiography is negative in patients with high suspicion of a fracture, both MRI and MDCT will be of value. However, it has been shown that MRI is superior for detecting trabecular fractures in carpal bones.
Figure 4: Dorsal triquetral fracture of the left wrist in a 30-year-old man after a trauma. (a) Anteroposterior radiograph shows a normal appearance. (b) Lateral radiograph of the same wrist demonstrates a chip fracture off the dorsal aspect of the triquetrum (arrow).
The greater tuberosity of the humerus is also an illustrative location of occult fractures. The osseous injury may follow seizures, glenohumeral dislocation, forced abduction, or direct impaction. They are commonly discovered on MRI in symptomatic patients with suspicion of rotator cuff tear. Coronal images are best suited for detection. They appear as crescentic oblique lines surrounded by a bone marrow edema pattern (Figure 5). The rotator cuff must be inspected since associated ligamentous lesions are common. In the ankle, malleoli and tarsal bones should be checked carefully for any cortical disruptions and radiolucent lines that may reveal a fracture. Awareness of the exact location of the pain will help direct the attention of the interpreter when searching for very subtle signs of fracture (Figure 6).
Figure 6: Subtle anterior talar fracture in a 39-year-old man presenting with ankle pain after a fall. (a) Anteroposterior radiograph shows a subtle oblique radiolucent line through the talus (white arrows). (b) Sagittal CT reformation confirms the presence of an anterior talar fracture with cortical offset (black arrow).
Avulsion fractures, which consist of a detached bone fragment resulting from a ligament or tendon pulling away from the bone, may also present with subtle radiographic signs. Tiny osseous fragments near the presumed attachment site of a ligament suggest this diagnosis. Common sites are the lateral tibial plateau (the Segond fracture), the spinal tuberosity of the tibia resulting from anterior cruciate ligament avulsion, and the ischial tuberosity.
Fatigue fractures.
Fatigue fractures occur when healthy bone is exposed to repeated stress. The bone is a living tissue, with the capacity to repair itself; fatigue fractures occur when repetitive injuries exceed the repair capacity of the bone. This type of fracture does not occur as a single event but rather incrementally as a sequence of cellular events that begin with increased osteoclastic activity. Microfractures occur later and are accompanied by bone marrow edema, which can be detected on MRI. This stage appears on MRI as an isolated bone marrow edema pattern without a fracture line and is called stress reaction. Then, periosteal new bone forms and may be visible on radiography. Full cortical fractures occur if the repetitive stress continues. Only timely detection and appropriate management can interrupt this sequence.
Fatigue fractures are more frequent in women which may be due to the relatively smaller bones of women. Moreover, pregnancy is a well-recognized risk factor for femoral neck fatigue fracture. While fibular and metatarsal fractures have a low risk of complications, other sites including the femoral neck, midanterior tibia, navicular, talar, and other intraarticular fractures are prone to complications such as delayed union, nonunion, and displacement. The site of the insufficiency fracture may be specific to the activity: for example, rugby and basketball players are more prone to navicular fractures, while gymnasts have a higher risk for talar fractures (Figure 7). Long distance runners are at increased risk for pelvic, tibial (Figures 8 and 9), and fibular fractures. In the military, calcaneus (Figure 10) and metatarsals are the most commonly cited injuries, especially in new recruits. Billiard players are at risk for upper limb fractures (Figure 11).
Figure 7: Fatigue fracture of the talus in a 25-year-old male basketball player with right hind foot and ankle pain, without history of trauma, and a normal initial radiograph (not shown). (a) One-month followup lateral radiograph shows normal appearance. (b) Sagittal T1-weighted MRI shows an irregular fracture line (arrow) within an ill-defined area of hypointensity corresponding to bone marrow edema.
Figure 8: Proximal diaphyseal fatigue fracture of the tibia in a 20-year-old man with a history of regular jogging. (a) Lateral radiograph shows no obvious fracture lines but a subtle localized medial tibial cortex periosteal reaction (arrows). (b) Sagittal reformatted CT image acquired 1-month after the radiograph shows a linear hypoattenuation in the tibial cortex (arrowhead), as well as obvious periosteal thickening (arrows). (c) Sagittal T2-weighted fat-saturated image acquired the same day shows an area of hyperintensity spreading over the proximal tibia (arrows), which is consistent with the presence of proximal tibial fracture.
Figure 9: Proximal metaphyseal fatigue fracture of the tibia in a 27-year-old recent male military recruit. (a) Anteroposterior radiograph is within normal limits. (b) Coronal T1-weighted MR image shows a marked linear hypoattenuation along the medial tibial metaphysis (arrow) surrounded by diffuse hypointensity in keeping with posttraumatic edema.

(a) Sagittal T1-weighted and (b) short tau inversion recovery images show a linear hypointensity (arrows) of calcaneal tuberosity within diffuse bone marrow edema, which appears as an ill-defined area of hyperintensity on a fluid sensitive pulse sequence (arrowheads).
Figure 11: Stress fracture of the right radius in a 40-year-old man, a semiprofessional billiard player, with no history of trauma and complaining of pain of the right forearm for one month. (a) Anteroposterior radiograph shows medial radial cortex periosteal reaction (arrow) but no fracture line is seen. (b) Coronal reformatted CT depicts monocortical fracture line through the periosteal thickening (arrowheads). (c) Coronal T2-weighted fat-suppressed MRI shows intramedullary hyperintensity within the bone marrow (arrow) corresponding to bone marrow edema.
Radiographic examination usually shows delayed signs of fracture up to 2 to 3 months after initial injury. In a bony region with a high proportion of cancellous bone (e.g., femoral neck), a fatigue fracture appears as an ill-defined transverse sclerotic band (in contact or close to the medial cortex), with a periosteal thickening appearing at a later stage. In case of continued stress, a fracture line through the thickened cortex and a region of sclerosis may be observed. MRI is of great value for early diagnosis and displaying bone marrow edema, while scintigraphy is useful for showing increased metabolic activity within the bone. However, MRI is preferred since scintigraphy lacks specificity. In case of isolated bone marrow edema in MRI without a fracture line, the diagnosis of fatigue fracture may be more complicated, and other conditions such as transient edema and osteoid osteoma need to be excluded. Additional imaging by CT is warranted in such cases.
Insufficiency fractures.
Insufficiency fractures occur in weakened bones. Although osteoporosis is a classic cause, other conditions resulting in bone demineralization are well-recognized risk factors. These include previous radiation therapy and chemotherapy, especially in a context of gynaecologic malignancy, chronic renal failure, chronic rheumatological diseases, and corticosteroid therapy. In long bones, chronic joint diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are associated with angular deformity and flexion contraction, increasing the stress on the bone around the joints and, therefore, the risk of insufficiency fracture. Pelvic, sacral, and proximal femoral fractures are of increasing significance especially with the aging of the population.
The sacrum is usually masked by overlapping bowel gas in conventional radiographs, and the subtle radiographic findings are usually nondiagnostic and even misleading. The characteristic "H" pattern has been correlated with biomechanical models of patient activities. The vertical parasagittal planes correspond to the region of maximal stress during walking, while the horizontal fracture develops later, secondary to the loss of lateral support by parasagittal fractures. MRI is the primary imaging technique in this case, with the most common MRI pattern showing bone marrow edema and a fracture line (Figure 12). Coronal views are quite contributive in sacral fractures, allowing the detection of the horizontal component, especially with fluid-sensitive sequences. Although the sacrum is the most commonly involved, pelvic insufficiency fractures are often multiple, and other typical locations should be mentioned.
Proximal femoral fractures usually occur in osteoporotic patients, and their signs include subtle neck angulation, trabecular angulation, and subcapital impaction line. A frog-leg lateral view may be helpful if the greater trochanter is short enough. However, positioning can be difficult because of hip pain. In patients with strong suspicion of proximal femoral fracture and negative radiographs, MRI limited to coronal T1 W images and scintigraphy can be highly valuable (Figures 13 and 14). Such an option, with limited examination time, is cost-effective and allows reliable exclusion or confirmation of the diagnosis, preventing an unnecessary stay at the hospital or delayed treatment. Moreover, MRI helps to detect soft tissue abnormalities which are more frequently seen in femoral, acetabular, and pubic injuries than sacral lesions. Concomitant fractures are also frequently seen in typical pelvic sites.
Figure 13: Partial osseous avulsion of the gluteal muscles at the greater trochanter in a 59-year-old man who presented with the right hip pain without a history of trauma. Lauenstein view and anteroposterior and radiographs (not shown) did not show an obvious fracture line or disruption of bony contours in the acetabulum or the right femoral neck. (a) Coronal T1-weighted MRI displays an incomplete fracture line extending partially from the greater trochanter (arrow). (b) Coronal short tau inversion recovery MRI shows heterogeneous hyperintensity in the same region (arrow) as well as hyperintensity within the gluteus medius and minimus muscles (arrowheads) consistent with tissue edema and hematoma.
Figure 14: Subcapital insufficiency fracture in a 55-year-old man with a left hip pain without a history of trauma. Anteroposterior and Lauenstein view radiographs centered on the left hip do not show an obvious fracture line, but mild acetabular osteophytosis was noted consistent with hip osteoarthritis (not shown). (a) Coronal T1-weighted MRI shows a linear low-signal band through the femoral neck corresponding to a fracture line (arrowheads). (b) Bone scintigraphy shows focal uptake (arrow) corresponding to the fracture.

Patrick Martyn-Hemphill, 5th Baron Hemphill

Peter Patrick Fitzroy Martyn Hemphill, 5th Lord Hemphill (born Dublin 5 September 1928 – died 6 April 2012), the late 5th Baron Hemphill succeeded to the title on his father's death in 1957.
Personal life.
He was educated at Glenstal Abbey School during the Second World War and then at Downside School where his father had been educated. After Downside he attended Brasenose College, Oxford. He added the "Martyn" part to his surname after the death of his grandmother in 1958; she was the daughter of Andrew Martyn, of Spiddal, Co Galway. Through the Martyns Hemphill inherited Tulira Castle, near Gort. This was originally a tower house but had considerable additions commissioned by Edward Martyn, founder of the Abbey Theatre. The castle and land were host to John Huston during his stay in Galway between 1960 and 1971 where they spent a considerable amount of time hunting with the Galway Blazers. Due to financial constraints Hemphill was forced to sell Tulira in 1982.
In 1952 he married Ann Rutlidge; they had three children, including Charles who inherited the title Baron Hemphill.
Hemphill died in the Galway Clinic on 6 April 2012.
Career.
Hemphill's first became involved in horse racing when he became Master of the Galway Blazers on inheriting the title. He held the position from 1967 to 1960 and from 1972 to 1986. Hemphill was elected to the Irish National Hunt Society in 1965 and was Senior Steward between 1975 and 1980. He was elected to the Irish Turf Club in 1972 and served as Senior Steward from 1985 to 1988. In that position he was instrumental in modernising the Irish racing industry and amongst other things he found major corporate sponsors that put the industry on a more professional footing. The Lord Hemphill Memorial Handicap Steeplechase is named in his honour.
House of Lords.
He took his seat in the House of Lords for the first time on 11 December 1957, and while he did occasionally sit there is no record of him making any contribution to debates. He remained a member of the House of Lords until the House of Lords Act 1999.

Scott Holmquist

Scott Holmquist (born in Minneapolis) is a conceptual artist who produces books, archives, and multi-media installations. He is best known for his work on African immigrant drug dealers in Berlin and Northern California cannabis growers.
Life.
Holmquist grew up in Minneapolis, where he worked summers in the building trades with his father. Besides the US, he has lived in Sweden and France, residing in Berlin, Germany, since 2011. He reads and speaks French, German, and Swedish.
He studied the socialist economics of Sweden's Löntagarfonderna (Employee funds) at the University of Gothenburg and social theory at the University of California, Berkeley. He has worked as a researcher for the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington DC.
Work.
Holmquist's work has received considerable media and institutional attention. Research on the Swedish raggare led to invitations to speak on the subject at Stockholm's Nordic Museum (Nordiska Museet). In 2013 "The Washington Post" described his work in "Peace.Love.Insurgency." as “political yet whimsical.”
About Holmquist's 2014 solo exhibition, "The Third Wall and the Last Hero" at Berlin's Kreuzberg Museum, Lothar Müller observed in the Süddeutsche Zeitung “[Holmquist has] monumentalised the insurgency of cannabis growers in Northern California against the U.S. government in the form of art books, then moved across the Atlantic and immersed himself in the revolutionary spirit of Kreuzberg.”
In 2016 Artnet reported that Holmquist's petition for a “monument to be erected in a park in the district of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg in honor of African drug dealers […] even gained political support” referring to the Pirate Party, then in Berlin government. Dozens of media outlets in several countries covered the intervention. In 2017 Holmquist's "Other Homelands: Origins and Migration Routes of Berlin Park Drug Dealers" supported by the Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung, provoked outrage and received support across Germany.
In October 2017, CDU Berlin political leaders initiated proceedings in the district assembly to oblige the FHXB Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum to cancel the "Other Homelands" exhibition. These efforts were thwarted by Green and Left Party assembly members.
Holmquist's March 2019 exhibition "DEALER POSES: Photographed and Remembered" at the IG Bildende Kunst gallery,” Vienna, Austria, elaborated on the themes of how public drug dealing is represented in dozens of collages made from press photos including those used to illustrate articles on the artist's exhibitions and interventions, for instance proposing a monument to the park drug dealer.
On 27 October 2019 Holmquist organised a twenty-four hour, “Park Dealer Solidarity Sit-in” art action in Berlin’s Görlitzer Park for which he erected his "LAST HERO" statue. “It's about how the reactions to park drug dealers crystallise fears, temptations, and desires, and at the same time shift the boundaries of control and solidarity,” said Holmquist.
Influence.
German culture critic Andreas Kilb used Holmquist’s "Last Hero" work in his discussion of Burhan Qurbani’s 2020 film adaption of Alfred Döblin’s modernist classic, Berlin Alexanderplatz in the 15 July 2020, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.”

Eonian

Eonian is the tenth studio album by Norwegian symphonic black metal band Dimmu Borgir, which was released on 4 May 2018.
Background.
Production of "Eonian" originally started at least in 2012 but faced many delays for years after. However, it was given an eventual official release date of 4 May 2018, which ended up being their first original studio album in nearly 8 years following 2010's "Abrahadabra". The band self-produced the album while the engineering was handled by Jens Bogren. Dimmu Borgir had to re-sign to their current label Nuclear Blast and reflect on communication during the eight-year gap. During this gap, three of the band members became fathers and focused on their family life. When describing the album's sound, Silenoz stated that the symphonic metal parts are more symphonic while the black metal sound of Dimmu is more black metal this time around. In April, Dimmu Borgir announced limited tour dates for the month of August 2018 with the band playing shows in Las Vegas, Chicago, Toronto, and New York City.
The first single from the album, "Interdimensional Summit", was released on 23 February 2018 on 7" vinyl with an accompanying promotional video. The song received a mixed reception from fans due to its inclusion of folk metal elements to the music. The second single, "Council of Wolves and Snakes", was released on 30 March 2018 with an accompanying music video.
Reception.
"Eonian" received mixed reviews from critics upon release. Jason Deaville of Metal Injection rewarded the album with a perfect 10/10, calling it "a stunning, unparalleled effort that should be heard by any lover of metal, no matter their preferred sub-genre. I'm going to go one further and say that "Eonian" should be heard by any real lover of music." ScreamingSteelUS of Metal Storm gave the album a 6.4/10 stating that "this is just Nightwish with Emperor Palpatine on vocals" while also finding the choirs to be irritating. Axl Rosenberg of MetalSucks gave the album two out of five stars mentioning that: "Yes, Dimmu are a symphonic band, but while "Death Cult Armageddon" used the symphony to paint soaring visions of the apocalypse and northern winds ripping your face off, "Eonian" seems content to use it as a go-to gimmick that does nothing for the atmosphere of the album other than corrode it". He then cited the album as "too happy" and said that if he wanted happy, he would go watch "The Wiggles". Max Morin of Exclaim! gave the album a 6/10 citing that "although frontman Shagrath has one of the most recognizable voices in metal, Dimmu haven't replaced the vocals of ICS Vortex, which were the highlight of their best releases". Morin believes that only on the first single, "Interdimensional Summit", is where the symphonic parts of the album hit as they should. A more positive review came from Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer who gave "Eonian" four out of five stars noting that the songs on the album are complex and memorable. He commented that "where "Abrahadabra" occasionally felt over-egged, "Eonian" is a masterclass in fine details and finesse".

Helena Nelson

Helena Nelson (born 1953) is a poet, critic, publisher and the founding editor of Happen"Stance" Press. She has lived in Fife, Scotland, since 1977.
Early life and education.
Nelson was born in Knutsford in Cheshire, England. She attended the Universities of York and Manchester, achieving a BA Hons in English Literature, and an MA in eighteenth century literature respectively. She worked for 25 years as a tutor in English and Communication at Fife College.
Poetry career and awards.
"Spectrum" magazine were first to publish Nelson's work in 1992, followed by "The Dark Horse". She won the Keats Shelley Memorial Association Millennium Competition in 2000, with an essay about Keats. In 2001, Nelson's debut pamphlet "Mr and Mrs Philpott on Holiday at Auchterawe, &amp; Other Poems" was published by Kettillonia Press, the independent publisher established by novelist and poet James Robertson. Her first full collection, "Starlight on Water", was published in 2003 by The Rialto Press and was a joint winner of the Jerwood Aldeburgh Prize. Her work was also included in the 2003 "Modern Scottish Women Poets" anthology.
In 2005, she created Happen"Stance" Press, using her own pamphlet, "Unsuitable Poems", as the pilot publication. The press receives no public funding, but survives on subscription and sales. It specialises in poetry pamphlets, and has published well over 100 poets, focusing mainly on UK-based authors and first collections. In 2010, Happen"Stance" Press won the Michael Marks Publishers' Award. Nelson also published twelve issues of a magazine called "Sphinx", focused on poetry pamphlet publishing. "Sphinx" still survives as an online repository for poetry pamphlet reviews and articles about pamphlet publishers. In 2013 Nelson published "Fife Place Name Limericks", based on poems written for a Fife Libraries competition in the early 1990s and illustrated by Gillian Rose.
Nelson occasionally runs workshops and talks on small-press publishing and reviewing. In 2004 she took part in "One Thousand Lines", the first schools tour by The Poetry Trust, alongside Matt Harvey and Neil Rollinson. She has delivered a number of workshops on getting poetry published, and her advisory pamphlet "How (not) to Get Your Poetry Published" was expanded to a book-length guide in 2016, and reprinted in 2017. She was an invited guest and speaker at the 2016 Scottish Women's Poetry Symposium organised by the University of Edinburgh.
Poetry in the age of hype and hypermedia.
In 2013, Nelson had a review essay, "Poetry in the Age of Hype", published in the poetry journal, The Dark Horse, which questioned whether poetry can be 'overblurbed'; whereby, in attempting to reach new audiences and create greater interest not just in the book but also in poetry itself, publishers may be overloading their praise to the extent of posing a problem for poets attempting to live up to the 'hype'.
Nelson's thoughtful take caused the writer &amp; poet Kei Miller to riff on this theme in his follow-up article in 2014, "Poetry in the Age of Hypermedia". In his essay, Miller expands the discussion further by examining the role hypermedia (Tweets, Facebook posts, online reviews etc.) plays in carrying the hype to potential readers. Miller contends that the World Wide Web is the most obvious example of hypermedia and that poetry must find a way to live with this world in establishing a place for itself in the future."The age of hypermedia seems to prove there is still an audience hungry for poetry, whether it be the kind of poetry that articulates communal experiences and emotions or the kind that tries to give insight into particular experiences. It will be interesting to see, in the future, how this audience continues to shape poetry and, indeed, to create the poets they need. I think what this large audience demands, as any audience should, is simply a poetry which they can access intellectually, which turns its face towards them and considers them as worthy people to write for... The future seems to want a poet who is as conversant with a perfect line of Shakespeare as they are with a perfect Tweet, poets who might consider adding to their literary craft with knowledge of video and sound production or HTML coding. The future is knocking. Welcome the hyperpoem!"

Barbara í Gongini

Barbara í Gongini (born June 12, 1966) is a Faroese-Danish avant-garde fashion designer from Fuglafjørður, Faroe Islands.
Early life and education.
Barbara í Gongini is a Faroese avant-garde fashion designer who was born in Fuglafjørður and grew up in the old part of Tórshavn, the capital city of the Faroe Islands. 
As a child, she always had an inclination for the arts and design, which led her to study painting, art and textile construction, graduating in 1990.
Gongini completed her design education at Denmark's School of Design, at the Institute of Unica Design, in 1996.
Growing up with the values of the Faroe Islands, a small community that places focus on using the most of raw natural resources, influenced Gongini's approach to fashion, inspiring her to create designs that are rich in multi-functional elements, so that they can be reused and transformed.
Fashion design career.
Gongini's first clothing collection was made from fabric residue and launched in 2000, when she was still part of the Könrøg movement. Könrøg was an artist collective formed by 10 Danish artists between 2001-2006, in response to the Antwerp Six designer collective that existed in the ‘80s.
In the early 2000s, she was also part of the team behind the Könrøg clothing store in Copenhagen, which at the time was known as the capital’s most hip shop with Danish designer clothes and Alternative fashion, for those who dared to stand out. Gongini stopped working for Könrøg in 2004 in order to focus on her design career, while the store closed down two year later, in 2006.
In 2005, Gongini established her namesake label, with the brand name stylised as BARBARA I GONGINI. In the early days, the BARBARA I GONGINI collections were created for both men and women, focusing on androgyny and multifunctionality. The menswear line only became separate starting with the Autumn/Winter 2013 collection, which was presented at the Copenhagen Fashion Week.
In her fashion designs, she makes extensive use of draping and layering techniques, often creating asymmetrical garments that can be worn in multiple ways. Juxtaposition and deconstruction play a central part, with Gongini predominantly using black and non-colors ‘to allow fabrics and textures to speak as color instead’.
She combines a variety of natural and recycled textiles, sometimes mixing several types of materials, such as wool, leather, cotton and plastic, in a single garment. Gongini's leather garments are often treated to give a dramatic texture that is reminiscent of the Faroese landscape. Her designs are available at the BARBARA I GONGINI headquarters showroom in Copenhagen and in specialized avant-garde clothing stores worldwide.
Gongini's avant-garde design philosophy means that the collections are not trend-based, but focus on ‘nurturing a longevity formula’. She often compares her collections to new chapters to turn to in a story, describing them as ‘numerical’. As a proponent of the zero-waste wardrobe, she seeks to lengthen the life-cycle of garments through innovative designs called ‘multiways’.
Although her fashion collections integrate sustainability principles and she has been said to be ‘ahead of her time when it comes to sustainability’, Gongini is known for making exceptions ‘if a few materials do not quite meet the standards’, in order not to compromise on design.
Nominated for the Danish Fashion Award Committee's Ethical Award in 2010, she was also selected to represent Denmark at the Nordic Eco Fashion and Product Design Exhibition in Berlin.
Her runway collections were first shown at the Paris Fashion Week in 2017. At this time, she also presented the film MODULE MODULAR, a video collaboration with director and photographer Mikkel Völcker.
In 2018, Barbara í Gongini was awarded the Faroese Cultural Prize, the highest distinction that a person of culture can receive in the Faroe Islands.
Artistic collaborations.
During her career, Gongini has been an active participant in the Nordic art discourse, joining interdisciplinary collaborations showcased around the world. Notable examples include “The Weather Diaries”, an exhibition which was part of the third Nordic Fashion Biennale, shown at the Museum Angewandte Kunst in Frankfurt and the Nordic Heritage Museum in Seattle, Washington, and “Outer Dark”, a collaboration that saw her work exhibited next to household avant-garde fashion names such as Yohji Yamamoto, Martin Margiela and Alexander McQueen.
In popular culture.
Barbara I Gongini's designs have been spotted on celebrities such as Florence Welch of Florence and the Machine, in her 2012 music video for Never Let Me Go, as well as on Lenny Kravitz, Rihanna and Chelsea Wolfe

David Chapman Farmstead

The David Chapman Farmstead is a historic house at 128 Stoddards Wharf Road in Ledyard, Connecticut. Built about 1744, it is a well-preserved example of a vernacular rural farmhouse of the period, built by a descendant of one of Ledyard's early settlers. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
Description and history.
The David Chapman Farmstead is located in a rural setting, on the north side of Stoddard Wharf Road just west of its crossing of Stoddard Brook. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, the bays set somewhat regularly but not symmetrical. The entrance is near the center, and both door and windows butt against the roof eave. The interior of the house has exposed architectural elements showing its construction history.
The house was built in two stages by David Chapman, the grandson of one of the area's early colonial proprietors, William Chapman. The oldest part of the house, its eastern half, dates to about 1744, and consisted of a single chamber on the ground floor with a loft in the attic, which was accessed by a ladder. In 1756, Chapman added the western half, also probably replacing the original roof with the present gambrel. Chapman may also have built the barn that stands at the back of the property, whose construction methods suggest it dates to the 18th century.

2018 West Virginia teachers' strike

The West Virginia teachers' and school personnel strike began on February 22, 2018 with a call from the West Virginia branches of the American Federation of Teachers and the National Education Association, and the West Virginia School Service Personnel for school employees across West Virginia to strike. The strike, called in response to anger among teachers and other school employees over low pay and high health care costs, involved roughly 20,000 teachers and public school employees and shut down schools in all 55 West Virginia counties, affecting some 250,000 students. It lasted until March 7, 2018.
The strike inspired teachers in other states, including Oklahoma, Colorado, and Arizona, to take similar action. Teachers in other states, including North Carolina and Kentucky have also coordinated protests and walkouts on a smaller scale.
Salary demands.
The strike was called in response to the low pay of West Virginia teachers, whose compensation ranks 48th in the United States. The strike also responded to a pay raise passed by the legislature and signed by Governor Jim Justice that provided only a 2% raise for 2019, and 1% raise for 2020 and a 1% raise for 2021 and a freeze on premiums for 16 months to benefits. The teachers' unions did not release vote totals for the strike. Every public school district in the state closed to avoid confrontations. It was the first such strike since 1990. According to some analysts, West Virginia teachers had a stronger negotiating position in the strike because many teaching positions remain unfilled. Teachers say that because of low pay in West Virginia, the state has difficulty attracting and retaining teachers.
Health insurance costs.
One of the major issues involved funding for the Public Employees Insurance Agency, the state health insurance plan. The West Virginia Legislature had voted to boost state contributions to the plan by using a percentage of the annual state surplus, but the teachers' unions were demanding a more reliable financing plan. Health care costs have increased quickly enough that proposed teacher pay increases cannot match teacher payments for health care.
Strike and negotiations.
The work stoppage took place in defiance of both state law forbidding public employee strikes and union leadership. On February 21, the day before the walkout, state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey warned that a strike "of any length on any ground is illegal” and said his office would support local districts attempting to enforce the state ban on public employee strikes. Nonetheless, on the same day, Governor Justice signed into law a bill offering teachers a 2% pay increase. "We need to keep our kids and teachers in the classroom," Gov. Justice said in signing the law. "We certainly recognize our teachers are underpaid and this is a step in the right direction to addressing their pay issue." Teachers said that the 2% pay raise, and subsequent raises of 1% slated for 2020 and 2021, would not keep up with inflation.
Teachers rejected the pay raise, walking out across the state on February 22. The same day, a crowd estimated at 5,000 demonstrated at the West Virginia State Capitol.
The strike continued on February 23, as all schools in the state were closed once again. Teachers and other workers rallied in front of the West Virginia State Capitol as well as picketed in front of individual schools. West Virginia teachers have a stronger negotiating position in the strike because many teaching positions remain unfilled.
A deal reached by union leaders and Governor Jim Justice was announced on February 27, and union leaders called on teachers and other education-related personnel to return to classrooms on Thursday March 1, after a "cooling off" period. However, during the late evening on February 28, every county announced school closures due to continuing work stoppages, and by this point the stoppage had become a wildcat strike. On March 3, the West Virginia Senate rejected a bill passed by the West Virginia House of Delegates approving the agreed upon 5% pay rise, instead proposing a 4% pay rise, extending the strike into an eighth work day.
A similar strike was proposed by teachers in Oklahoma, where teacher compensation is worse than in West Virginia, at 49th in the United States. On Sunday March 4, 1,400 West Virginia Frontier Communications workers went on strike in response to company restructuring, also citing rising health care costs, and the example of the Teacher's Strike.
West Virginia school personnel returned to classrooms on Wednesday March 7 after the State Senate agreed to the House's position following conference committee negotiations. The strike, while achieving a 5% pay raise, did not provide guarantees to control rising health care costs.
Reactions.
Justice and other Republican lawmakers opposed the strike and asserted that the teachers' absence from the classroom were hurting school children. He also said there was not enough money to fund teachers' demands. “I’m telling you when we should do more is when we know we can do more," Justice said on February 23. "Today we think we can do more, but we don’t know. Our teachers need to be in the classroom. The Legislature has spoken and I’ve signed it into law.” Justice, a billionaire coal magnate, won election in 2016 as a Democrat with the endorsements of the AFT-WV and the WVEA, along with other unions in the state. He subsequently switched to the Republican Party.
Union officials sought backing from prominent state Democratic Party leaders, inviting them to speak at teachers' demonstrations during the strike.
The strike was noteworthy because it emerged from rank-and-file teachers, who began to demand statewide strike action. Pressure to strike was "coming from everywhere," Christine Campbell, AFT-WV president, said in early February. These demands coalesced into a series of rallies and demonstrations held throughout the state. Ultimately the strike became a wildcat when teachers refused back-to-work orders from the unions.
The World Socialist Web Site, daily publication of the Socialist Equality Party, which published many interviews with teachers, argued that the AFT-WV and WVEA would settle the strike on unfavorable terms to school employees. It called on teachers to form rank-and-file committees independent of the trade unions and to broaden the strike to include teachers in other states and other groups of workers in West Virginia.
The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) issued a press release, demanding that the strike continue unless a series of demands were met, including a tax on natural gas production to fund state education. A number of IWW members (Wobblies) were key contributors to the effort, including as building representatives.

<doc id="56666586" url="?curid=56666586" title="Senapati of Mataram">
Senapati of Mataram

Panembahan Senapati, formally styled Panembahan Senapati ing Ngalaga Sayyidin Panatagama (died in Jenar (now in Purwodadi, Purworejo), 1601), was the founder of the Mataram Sultanate. His biography is discovered from traditional accounts, such as Javanese chronicles in the future era.
Origin.
Born with the name Danang Sutawijaya alias Dananjaya was the son of Ki Ageng Pamanahan, a Javanese chief and retainer to Joko Tingkir, who reigned as Hadiwijaya, Sultan of Pajang. It was said that Pamanahan was a descendant of the last Majapahit king. Sutawijaya's mother was Nyai Sabinah who, according to Javanese chronicles, was a descendant of Sunan Giri, a member of Walisanga. It showed that there was an effort of Javanese chroniclers to make a cult of personality toward the rulers of Mataram and its successor states as the descendants of extraordinary men.
Nyai Sabinah had a brother namely Ki Juru Martani, who would be elected as the first "patih" (viceregent) of Mataram. He had an important role in arranging strategy to suppress Arya Penangsang's rebellion in 1549.
Sutawijaya was also adopted by Hadiwijaya as an inducement, because Hadiwijaya and his wife still had no children yet in that time. Hadiwijaya gave him a residence in the north of a market, thus his nickname Raden Ngabehi Loring Pasar.
Early role.
According to Javanese tradition, the Senopati who was Joko Tingkir's foster son assassinated Arya Penangsang of Jipang-Panolan (now in Cepu, Blora Regency), making him the last direct heir of the Sultans of Demak. His death established the legitimacy of the Sultanate of Pajang.
Senapati ing Alaga.
Ki Ageng Pamanahan was granted Mataram region in 1556. After his death in 1575, Sutawijaya succeeded him as a chief of Mataram, styled Senapati Ing Ngalaga (meaning "commander in battlefield").
In 1576, Ngabehi Wilamarta and Ngabehi Wuragil of Pajang came to Mataram to ask for Mataram's loyalty, given that Senapati didn't come to Pajang more than a year. Senapati, who was riding his horse in Lipura village, did't pay attention for them. However, the two senior officials were able to keep Sultan Hadiwijaya's feeling from the report they had arranged.
Divine mandate.
The traditional chronicle "Babad Tanah Jawi" alleges that Senopati, in his quest to become the supreme ruler of Java, had a spiritual alliance with Nyai Roro Kidul, the Javanese goddess of the Indian Ocean. The Babad, however derives Senopati's support from Muslim saint Sunan Kalijaga, who is considered to be one of the Wali Songo or 'Nine Apostles' of Islam in Java. Other than Nyi Roro Kidul, Senapati also contacted the ruler of Mount Merapi. He also built fortification and trained his soldiers.
Rebellion against Pajang.
In his effort, Senapati also dared to divert the journey of "mantri pamajegan" (tax collector) from Kedu and Bagelen who wanted to deliver tax to Pajang. They could be persuaded by Senapati so they swore allegiance to him.
Sultan Hadiwijaya was restless to hear about his adopted son's development. He then sent 3 messengers to investigate Mataram's development, i.e. Arya Pamalad of Tuban, Prince Benawa, and Patih Mancanegara. Senapati welcomed them with party. However, there was a quarrel between Raden Rangga (Senapati's son) with Arya Pamalad.
In 1582, Sultan Hadiwijaya banished Tumenggung Mayang to Semarang because he had helped his son, Raden Pabelan, to enter "keputren" (residence for Mataram princesses) and seduce Ratu Sekar Kedaton, Sultan's youngest daughter. Raden Pabelan himself was sentenced to death and his corpse was thrown away to Jenes River in Laweyan (currently located in Surakarta).
Pabelan's mother was Senapati's sister. Senapati then sent "mantri pamajegan" to liberate Tumenggung Mayang who were on journey to exile.
Outraged by Senapati's action, Sultan Hadiwijaya invaded Mataram with his soldiers. The war then took place. Pajang's soldiers could be defeated although outnumbered Mataram's one.
Sultan Hadiwijaya fell sick in his journey back to Pajang, and died after it. In his deathbed, Sultan Hadiwijaya requested to his children not to dislike Senapati and they had to treat him as an eldest brother. Senapati himself also attended his adoptive father's funeral.
Ruler of Mataram.
Arya Pangiri was Sultan Hadiwijaya's son-in-law who became Duke of Demak. Supported by Panembahan Kudus, he occupied Pajang in 1583 and ousted Prince Benawa by appointing him as Duke of Jipang.
Prince Benawa then allied with Senapati in 1586. They viewed Arya Pangiri's reign had harmed people of Pajang. The war broke out. Arya Pangiri was arrested and sent back to Demak.
Prince Benawa offered Pajang's throne to Senapati, but refused. Senopati just demanded some Pajang's heirlooms to be looked after in Mataram.
Prince Benawa became Sultan of Pajang until 1587. He requested that Pajang was merged with Mataram. He requested Senapati to be Mataram's king. Pajang then became Mataram's vassal state, administered by Prince Gagak Baning, Senapati's brother.
Since that time, Senapati became the first ruler of Mataram, titled Panembahan. He didn't want to use Sultan as a title to honour Sultan Hadiwijaya and Prince Benawa. His royal court was located in Kotagede.
Reign.
During his reign, the kingdom adhered to Javanese traditions, although Islam had already been introduced to Java. The Javanese Muslim state of Pajang (and the ancient Hindu-Javanese kingdom of Mataram, still on the same site) got in trouble when Panembahan Senopati schemed to undermine the authority of the King of Pajang. Senopati had conquered the Mataram district himself and circa 1576 he conquered Pajang, imposed the new religion and established his own court. The Mataram ruler refused to embrace Islam. Many historiographical problems surrounded Senopati's reign. He concentrated his spiritual powers through meditation and asceticism. Senopati's reliance upon both Sunan Kalijaga and Nyai Loro Kidul in the chronicles' accounts nicely reflects the Mataram Dynasty's ambivalence towards Islam and indigenous Javanese beliefs. The straight line between Mount Merapi at the north and the southern sea, with the Mataram kingdom at the center, was a strong concept of cosmology among the Javanese.
Senopati's grandson, Sultan Agung (the Great Sultan, 1613–1645), was described as a great Muslim ruler and was claimed as the greatest of Mataram's rulers, though both Senopati and Sultan Agung established a liaison with the Goddess of the Southern Ocean of Nyai Loro Kidul.
Expanding Mataram's territory.
After Hadiwijaya's death, many vassal states in East Java seceded. The alliance of East Java's dukes were still led by Surabaya as the strongest entity. They were involved in a battle against Mataram in Mojokerto, but they could be mediated by Giri Kedaton's messenger.
Other than Pajang and Demak, Pati was also subjugated peacefully. Pati was led by Duke Pragola I, son of Ki Panjawi. His sister Queen Waskitajawi became the main queen consort of Mataram. It had made Duke Pragola I hoped that Mataram would be led by his sister's descendants.
In 1590, joined troops of Mataram, Pati, Demak, and Pajang attacked Madiun, which were led by Rangga Jumena (the youngest son of Sultan Trenggana), who had prepared a large troops awaiting the invader. With a brilliant trickery, Madiun was conquered. Rangga Jumena fled to Surabaya, while his daughter namely Retno Dumilah was married by Senapati.
In 1591, a coup d'etat took place in Kediri. Raden Senapati of Kediri was driven out by new regent, Ratujalu, supported by Surabaya.
Raden Senapati of Kediri was adopted by Panembahan senapati as his son and he helped him to take over the throne of Kediri. The war ended with the death of both Raden Senapati with Duke Pesagi (his uncle).
In 1595, Duke of Pasuruan intended to submit to Mataram peacefully, but was prevented by his commander, Rangga Kaniten. Rangga Kaniten was defeated by Panembahan Senapati in a duel. He himself was assassinated by Duke of Pasuruan, who swore allegiance to Mataram.
In 1600, Duke Pragola I of Pati rebelled against Mataram. The rebellion was precipitated by appointment of Retno Dumilah of Madiun as second queen consort. Pati military forces were able to occupy some regions in the north of Mataram. A war broke out near Dengkeng River, where Mataram force led by Senapati himself destroyed Pati force.
Death.
Panembahan Senapati alias Danang Sutawijaya died in Kajenar village in 1601. He was buried in Mataram Cemetery, Kotagede and was succeeded by his son Mas Jolang, born from Ratu Mas Waskitajawi.

Laudo Hayes Firm Day

Laudo Hayes Firm Day is an annual provincial holiday in a department of Paraguay celebrated annually on November 12. It commemorates U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes' intervention in an international border dispute between Paraguay and Argentina, arbitrated in favor of Paraguay. The area that became Presidente Hayes Department with its capital city of Villa Hayes was named for the U.S. president who awarded an area that comprises 60 percent of modern Paraguay to the country while arbitrating a boundary dispute between Paraguay and Argentina after the Paraguayan War, which Paraguay lost, and in which hundreds of thousands died, including more than half of Paraguay's population. The dispute over the remote "Chaco Boreal", the Gran Chaco region and Chaco (Paraguay) specifically was settled. The area is sparsely populated and includes many indigenous people. The compromise was reached after 8 years of negotiations on November 12, 1878.

The Darkside Detective

The Darkside Detective is a 2017 point-and-click adventure video game developed by Spooky Doorway, and published by Akupara Games. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS and Linux on July 27, 2017, for Nintendo Switch on February 7, 2018 and for PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X and Series S, Xbox One and Stadia on April 8, 2021. A limited run of 5,000 physical copies for the Nintendo Switch was released on 26 September 2019.
Game Setting.
Darkside Detective is set on the fictional city of Twin Lakes, a metropolis known for its occasional reports of criminal activity though several of them are discovered to be of a supernatural nature, as the city is linked to a outwordly, ghost world reflection of itself known as the 'Darkside'.  Owing to this, the Twin Lakes' police department keeps its own (though underfunded) branch known as the Darkside Division, headed by Detective Francis McQueen and his partner Patrick Dooley, who investigate such cases.
The game is known for its satirical nature, drawing multiple references to pop culture, including its case names such as "Buy Hard" or "Don of the Dead".  It also draws strong influence from buddy cop, science fiction and horror movie genres. All cases but "Buy Hard", "Polterguys" and "Baits Motel" (As these are part of the Bonus Cases) are available at the game.
Cases.
Malice in Wonderland.
McQueen and Dooley are called in to investigate a missing child occurrence in the home of the wealthy Jones family.  The child, Alice, has not been seen for over a day and there was no witnessing of her leaving the house, even though she was under the direct care of her babysitter, Nanny McPhiend.  When McQueen goes to interrogate McPhiend in the master bedroom, he notices something under the bed, discovered to be a page related to occultism.  As McQueen and Dooley search the house, they discover both a blacklight lamp and pencil, which they test at the upper attic, revealing a door-like drawing on the wall.  McQueen completes it using the page as reference, opening a door to the Darkside in which he finds Alice within.
As they prepare to leave, Alice and McQueen are cornered by McPhiend, who knocked out Dooley while he was at door cover duty.  It is revealed that McPhiend intended to use the doorway to trap both Alice's parents and take Alice into custody as a legal guardian, thus gaining access to the Jones' inheritance.  However, Alice, while exploring, unintentionally entered the doorway as the shelf holding paint thinner collapsed and sprayed at the wall, cleaning a part of the drawing and closing the doorway, trapping Alice within.
McQueen manages to fool McPhiend into getting him and Alice to the real world, under the pretense of having to drag Dooley within as well.  McQueen quickly grabs the paint thinner and splashes it on the doorway corner while McPhiend is within, trapping her in the Darkside.  Alice is returned to her parents as McQueen and Dooley, now recovered, return to the precinct musing "what sort of paperwork covers this mess".
Tome Alone.
McQueen and Dooley arrive at the Twin Lakes Library to return some overdue books when they discover a storm with a mysterious purple vortex happening above the building, whose lights are also constantly flickering.  As they ask the local Librarian, Doris, she suspects a frequently visiting child, Devon, is behind the occurrences.  They approach Devon who is talking to a floating book, but he pretends to know nothing on the matter.  They also come across Raxa, an occultism and computer science college student also investigating the occurrences on the Library, who reports a strange glow coming from a stack of microfilm.
As McQueen uses a viewmaster to investigate the microfilm, he spots an old case newspaper report with an eye-like drawing, that suddenly makes McQueen start seeing ghosts of popular literary authors across the Library, including Aleister Crowley, W.B. Yeats, Enid Blyton, Mary Shelley, Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett.  After resolving a dispute between the ghosts of H.P. Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe by using a book Doris was reading, "Guylight", McQueen discovers a secret passageway within the horror section of the Library, finding a clandestine collection of occult books, one of them being a tome charged by faulty electric wiring from the building's lightning rod on the rooftop.  McQueen and Dooley head to the rooftop where they perform a bypass at the rod's wiring, cutting electric supply to the faulty wiring where the tome is.  With the energy cut, the storm passes away and the ghosts all disappear.
McQueen and Dooley confiscate the occult books, making a deal with Doris to not issue a fine as the charges against Devon are dropped.  McQueen also advises Doris to fix the faulty wiring as they return to the precinct.
Disorient Express.
McQueen is called by Dooley to pick him up for a ride after he learns the subway station is closed down.  After learning that the station is closed due to a literal ghost train on the platform, however, McQueen decides to stay and investigate, discovering a portal to the Darkside at the tunnel where the ghost train is as well as other occurrences on the real world, such as a ghost using a toilet and a purple tentacle as well.  Travelling to the Darkside, McQueen and Dooley come across their twisted versions of the Darkside, Agent McScream and Chief Ghouley of the Brightside Division, as well as they find the real world train, with Raxa suspiciously inside.  Investigating the train station on the Darkside, McQueen is able to acquire a key to the control room on the real world, but is unable to get it across due to McScream, forcing McQueen to use the toilet tentacle, through a plunger, to transport the key between both worlds.
Using the key to unlock the control room, they find Tam, a disgruntled intellectually disabled engineer who infected the control systems with a supernatural virus, as retaliation for being fired as he was sleeping on the job (explained by Tam that he attended black magic classes at midnight hour to the morning hours, where it was his shift immediately afterwards).  With Raxa's aid, McQueen and Dooley are able to clean the infection and restore the control systems, allowing both the ghost train and the real world train to traverse to their respective worlds and restore transit.  Tam is arrested and taken to the precinct.
As McQueen and Dooley head out to Officer McNugget's retirement party at the precinct, they enter to discover the gift pile is on fire, which McQueen quickly puts away, revealing a mysterious urn.  McQueen recognizes it as a magical urn meant to hold gremlins which belonged to a previously investigated Chinese store, but Dooley foolishly bought it as a gift and allowed the gremlins to run loose.  McQueen and Dooley are forced to scramble across the precinct to collect all the gremlins provoking mischief (such as in the dispatch station, where a gremlin is eating the server's wiring and another in the shooting gallery is armed), neutralizing them with electricity and tear gas.
As all the gremlins are collected and put back in the urn, Dooley accidentally lets it slip to the floor, breaking it.  Using a clay package from a union worker, McQueen makes a new urn, but requires a tome to enchant it and entrap the gremlins back again, which is in the evidence room, blocked by McQueen's rival, Detective McKing, on a dating attempt.  McQueen spikes a cup of coffee with laxatives to force McKing to the bathroom, allowing McQueen to enter the evidence room, acquire the tome, perform the ritual and trap all gremlins back.
When McQueen and Dooley return to the party, they discover the party is over, with the cake being eaten, and are forced to clean their mess as the department's budget "doesn't allow for both your capers and the custodial staff".
Loch Mess.
McQueen is called by Dooley's "Bloodwolves" scout group to attend an emergency at their camp site (Ironically named Camp Site), during the group's jamboree.  Arriving there, the kids present - including Devon from the Library - inform McQueen Dooley had mysteriously vanished.  When McQueen, accompanied by the scouts, start to investigate, they come across a sentient oscilloscope named BETI (Based on SETI, though "much better" and with a camera lens resembling HAL 9000), which informs Dooley had crossed the camp's lake after receiving a high frequency wi-fi signal.  McQueen uses BETI to track Dooley's location to an island amidst the lake.
As McQueen reaches the isle and finds a cave entrance, he encounters Dooley in the company of the Loch Ness Monster, named Nigel, who has summoned Dooley for aid in evading 'government pursuit', when he is actually being stalked by the sensasionalist reporter Dick Brickman as well as avid conspiracy theorists.  Using an adultered version of the printed map from BETI, McQueen manages to lead Brickman to a wrong location in the island as he uses the reporter's camera to photograph a mockery of the monster (which are the Bloodwolves piled up in a Chewbacca-ish costume) for the conspiracy theorists.  Finally, McQueen crafts a tin foil hat for Nigel to use, to prevent the government from tracking him.
With all this done, Nigel is confident enough to return to the lake and depart while Dooley returns for the jamboree to continue.
Don of the Dead.
McQueen and Dooley are summoned by Chief Scully, along with the entire staff, to attend occurrences during a city-wide riot, where a police officer was already injured.  One detail that gets McQueen's attention is the mindless state of the supposed rioters.  As he's dispatched, he's assigned to occurrences in three locations - The Twin Lakes Museum, a gift store in Chinatown (Revealed to be the store where Dooley had bought the urn with gremlins for the "Police Farce" party) and the mansion of the deceased crime boss Al Corpsone.
At the Mansion, they come across Raxa, now an "Inspooktor", after saving her when she is cornered by a rioter, revealed to be a zombie.  Raxa informs she originally came to the mansion after learning of strange occurrences at the place, and her equipment's readings spiked when unknown creatures entered the mansion, supposedly looking for the Don.  At the Chinatown store, they save the owner, Mister Wang, from his collection of monkey paws that started acting out of control.  Wang tells McQueen that the paws started moving after some "floating goons" had robbed ritual components from the store.  At the Museum, McQueen and Dooley investigate a break-in occurrence when they come across a mummy, which they lure back to its sarcophagus using a brain jar.  McQueen and Dooley realize that a glass case of Osiris' bust was broken, with a gem stone missing.  With what he learns of all three occurrences, McQueen realizes that criminals from the Darkside are intended on resurrecting Corpsone, utilizing the riot as a smoke screen to acquire the ritual components, Corpsone's corpse and the Gem of Osiris to perform the ritual.
McQueen and Dooley race to the graveyard, infested by the zombies but driven away by the gun fire of two gangster ghosts as a ghost priest starts the ritual at the crypt.  Dooley and McQueen split ways, with Dooley headed to the sewers where he encounters an alligator named Jacques, watching television in the sewers, as well as an evil clown, Poundsmart, and a working crew which Dooley confuses for members of a secret organization.  In the graveyard, McQueen comes across Smithy, a British World War I veteran as well as Agent McScream and Ghouley, pinned down within the graveyard's church.  McQueen disguises himself as a zombie and learns their 'language' from McScream to gather a horde and breach through to the crypt.  McQueen arrives too late to stop the ritual, and as the resurrected zombie Corpsone orders the other zombies to kill McQueen, the floor is collapsed by Dooley, who used a jackhammer in a sewer grating.  When Dooley is pinned down in the rubble, McQueen uses a stolen car to collapse a water tower (blessed with holy water) to neutralize all zombies, but Corpsone survives and tries strangling Dooley until McQueen traps him in a lifesaver marked with ritual glyphs, banishing Corpsone back to the Darkside.  McQueen and Dooley leave the crypt as McScream and Ghouley force the priest, Alexander Pope, to reverse his ritual and putting an end to all living dead, and thus the riots.
As they return to the precinct, they are dismayed to learn that McKing has taken all credit for stopping the riots, and the events of the zombie riot are dismissed by leaked water from the graveyard's tower which passed by the graves prior to flowing to the reservoir, provoking mass hysteria.  Regardless, Dooley considers McQueen a hero for saving the city.
Buy Hard.
McQueen and Dooley head to the Twin Lakes Mall in to buy late-Christmas gift while taking Dooley's unruly nephew, Buzz, along to visit Santa Claus.  However, when they go visit Santa's house and briefly leave Buzz behind at the children's line, a sudden quake occurs in the mall which makes McQueen and Dooley race back to the house only to find Santa Claus has been transformed into the Krampus and the children - including Buzz - into unruly green gnomes, which start wreaking havoc across the mall.  McQueen and Dooley are forced to capture and restrain Buzz, who was attempting to reach the Christmas tree's star through the mall's enormous fountain, interrogating him to learn that the Krampus is actually Santa's polar opposite, in which brings out the worst traits from children.  When questioned in how to stop the Krampus, the Buzz-gnome informs that the Krampus is actually a lactose-intolerant, which has McQueen formulate a plan.
With the assistance of Emily, a member of the Bloodwolves who was with her family at the Mall Arcade and attempting to steal the claw machine's prizes, McQueen spikes a cookie with milk and has Emily deliver the cookie to the Krampus.  The plan works as the Krampus inflates and floats away, revealing a ventilation shaft in which McQueen enters to investigate.  Along the vents, he finds pieces of Santa Claus' clothing (And other strange things as a small city and the purple toilet tentacle from "Disorient Express") until he reaches Santa Claus himself, revealed to be the genuine Christmas figure who was kidnapped by the Krampus to jeopardize Christmas' night.  Santa gives McQueen a supply of his Christmas dust to use it on the water supply and return the children to normal.  As Santa tries leaving the mall however, his sleigh's reindeer Rudolph is bootstrapped by Detective McKing for illegal parking, and with all the Christmas dust used, the sleigh cannot lift off.  McQueen however, manages to bring Emily, a non-believer of Santa Claus who starts believing after receiving her wished gift - a blowtorch - and creates Christmas dust around McQueen and Dooley's car.
Santa, McQueen and Dooley strap the sleigh to the police car and thus all take off and start delivering gifts before returning home to a merry Christmas...  And accidentally leaving Buzz, still tied to the chair even after returning to normal, behind.  
Polterguys.
Dooley invites McQueen to his house for dinner (As McQueen usually does so every once in a month), but when they enter the house and into the living room, they find the television possessed by a poltergeist called Paulie, who was trapped within a VHS tape by a team of game developers for no reason and thus made him hell-bent in haunting the house of whichever person that rented him.
Buzz, Dooley's nephew, reveals that Dooley's sister Patricia had rented the tape from Indian Burial Ground Video Rentals Inc., but failed to notice it as she had been busy with the dinner's preparations.  As the VHS cannot be manually ejected nor unplugged (As Paulie shocks any who attempt), McQueen and Dooley set out to find the remote control, finding it within the pantry that became a void portal to the Darkside.  Using a line of sausages and sheets, McQueen successfully grabs the remote and ejects the tape, but Paulie's influence remains within.  McQueen and Dooley use cooked garlic's juices to cleanse the VHS tape of evil influence and put it back in to frighten Paulie away from the house.
With the spirit gone, McQueen and Dooley can finally rejoice for dinner.
Baits Motel.
At Dooley's birthday, McQueen takes him for an off-road trip (Which he lies to Chief Scully that they're headed off-town due to an El Chupacabra appearance) and both arrive at the Baits Motel to see the main attraction which is the salvaged material from Lake Monster stored at the "Trout of This World" museum.  However, as they book their rooms for the motel, leave their luggage and head to the attraction itself, they find it closed under a localized sandstorm, which McQueen decides to investigate about.
Using a carnival truck to block the sandstorm on the way, McQueen and Dooley come across Jamie, the Bloodwolves' camp kiosk attendant, who informs them the sandstorm began after a fisherman briefly passed by the museum and then left.  As McQueen and Dooley dig through and enter the museum, they find an open genie lamp with a recorded message that he's away, leading McQueen and Dooley to start looking for the genie itself.  They find it at the company of a German tourist named Otto, who released him as to wish the 'greatest lake junk' in the world to collect, but nothing else.  The genie itself, named Ash, informs he cannot return to his lamp until all three wishes are fulfilled.
Seeking for guidance, McQueen drinks a 'spiritual mix' (made out of trashed energy drink cans and Dooley's protein supplements) amidst the desert where he comes across an Incan-like temple inhabited by bodybuilding werewolves.  After aiding them in switching their bench weights, McQueen and Dooley suddenly lift-off to space in bubbles where they come across special stamps from "Fed-Xtra Dimensional".  Returning to the normal world, Dooley theorizes the symbols they found must be a combination to release the genie, and suggests stamping them on the lamp, which they do.
Decided to get the genie back in the lamp, McQueen and Dooley start working to disrupt Otto's night, messing with his room's TV signal and sabotaging the kitchen, prompting Otto to wish for food, sabotaging his air conditioner to have him at the swimming pool and then throwing a bag of crows to attack him, having Otto wish for the Genie to save him, and finally ruining his clothing and sabotaging the laundry to have Otto wish for clean clothing.  As all wishes are legitimate and had no other way of solving the issues, the genie is released from his bondage to Otto and returns to his lamp, at the same time a mailman ghost from the Darkside, working for Fed-Xtra, takes the lamp away after being properly stamped.
As McQueen and Dooley prepare to return to their room, suddenly Dooley is teleported away to the Darkside, as a shadowy figure observes and it ends in a cliffhanger.
Development.
The original prototype of The Darkside Detective was created by Paul Conway and Christopher Colston at a short game jam in Galway, Ireland. The demo was made in under eight hours, but received significant attention after it was posted online, prompting them to turn it into a full game. After decided to enter production on the game, writer Dave McCabe and lead developer Tracey McCabe joined the team to assist in the production.
During the development process, the team of four would do group read throughs to discuss issues and ideas, with McCabe then creating an interactive version of any ideas that they had using clipart to allow them to further map out how it would work within the game. Once an idea was decided on, the team would then start creating visuals, animations, interactions, sound and music based around the idea.
Reception.
The Darkside Detective received mostly positive reviews and has a score of 81% on Metacritic. Hardcore Gamer awarded it a score of 3.5 out of 5, saying "The Darkside Detective is a charming point and click adventure with a taste for the sillier aspects of horror." Video Gamer awarded it 7 out of 10, saying "The Darkside Detective has a very distinct sense of humour that you'll either love or hate." Ted Hentschke of Dread Central praised the gameplay and atmosphere but criticising its short length, saying "If the game were 50% longer, I would be in serious danger of genuinely loving it. As it is, it’s just a fun diversion for a few hours." Jimmy Donnellan of Cultured Vultures awarded it a score of 8 out of 10, saying "Funny and offbeat, The Darkside Detective is a joyful but basic point and click game that is simply over too soon." However, CJ Andriessen of Destructoid awarded it a more negative score of 5.5 out of 10, and said "Its lightweight, cornball comedy opts for cheap and easy jokes I never really find funny", although he did praise both the soundtrack and the art style.

Société de l'industrie minérale

The Société de l'industrie minérale (SIM: Mineral Industry Society) is a French association of mineral processing companies and people involved in these industries.
It was created in 1855. 
It supports exchange of information on mining through its journals, website, meetings and congresses, and represents the mining industry in various forums.
Functions.
The Société de l'industrie minérale (SIM) is a non-profit organization that serves all francophone countries and participates in many international organizations.
It has nine districts in France and a group in Belgium.
Its goal is to promote and disseminate scientific and technical knowledge related to mineral substances.
It covers all aspects of the mineral industry from prospecting through extraction and processing to post-use treatment and recycling.
It communicates through its publications, its website and through the events it organizes, which include technical days and an annual congress and exhibition.
As of 2012, there were 250 stands of materials suppliers and service providers at the exhibition.
History.
The Société de l'industrie minérale was the brainchild of the mining engineer Emmanuel-Louis Gruner, who became the first president.
It was founded on 29 April 1855, in Saint-Étienne with the stated goal of contributing to advances in the art of mining, metallurgy and related industries.
Regional districts were created in 1860.
The first congress of the SIM was held in 1875 in Saint-Étienne.
On 5 March 1879, the society was recognized as a public utility.
Édouard Gruner (1849–1933), son of Emmanuel-Louis Gruner, was president of the Société d'encouragement pour l'industrie nationale from 1907 to 1909.
He was also president of the Houillères de la Haute-Loire, Aciéries de Paris et d'Outreau and the Société de l'industrie minérale (1922–1933), and was an advocate at the Musée social for these employer interests groups.
In 1952, the SIM districts organized the first of the annual congresses.
In 1955, on the centenary of the SIM, study days and exhibitions were staged in Saint-Etienne and Paris
In 1985, a French National Committee distinct from the SIM was created for French representation at the World Mining Congress.
The society's head office was transferred to Paris in 19 July 1990.
Publications.
The society's "Bulletin" included papers and reports on subjects of interest to miners and metallurgists.
Gruner published his own work in the Bulletin from 1855 to 1858 and supported it with his advice after leaving Saint-Etienne to become professor of metallurgy in Paris.
The "Bulletin"'s July–September 1855 issue had an article on the goals of the society by Gruner followed by articles on ventilation, fuel efficiency, the mineral trade of Marseille, metal prices and so on.
The "Bulletin" became a monthly publication in 1909.
In 1921, it was renamed the "Revue de l'industrie minérale" (RIM: Mineral Industry Review).
In 1988, it became "Mines &amp; Carrières" (Mines &amp; Quarries), published monthly with a bimonthly supplement "Les Techniques".
The quarterly "Recyclage &amp; Valorisation" ("Recycling &amp; Recovery") was launched in 2003.
Other publications include the "World Mining and Metals Yearbook : Annuaire statistique mondial des minerais et métaux", published in association with the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières.
Presidents.

Neither of the two relied on advertisements and survived mainly on money made form circulation. "Súper Luchas" usually contained less text than "Box y Lucha" and featured more photographs than interviews or opinion pieces. The magazine would do photo shoots with wrestlers such as Chris Jericho when they traveled to Mexico. During the late 1990s the magazine has employed both freelance reporters who were paid per page and staff writers who were paid a salary each month. The magazine would sometimes reveal the real faces or masked luchadors. In 2010 their official site (at the time Superluchas.net) became one of the three first sites to sell Masked Republic lucha masks legally. The magazine became available for US subscribers in 2012.
"Súper Luchas" has also promoted wrestling events.

Legal fake

Legal fake is a phenomenon in the fashion industry wherein a third company precedes the original brand company in the registration of the trademark, running its own business, from production to sales, in another country. By exploiting the products, creativity, marketing and advertising strategies of the original brand, the company misleads consumers, who are not aware of the fake goods. Thus, its typical traits lay upon the question of intellectual property, trademark registration laws among different countries, advertising strategies and consumer behaviour.
Legal fake, like all oxymorons, uses auto-antonym to illustrate a rhetorical point. Legal fake is not a legal term and should not be confused with counterfeit. Although it replicates the original products, its aim is to create a new business parallel to that of the original brand, proposing itself as an authentic brand. Compared to counterfeit products, legal fakes exploit brands that are well-known only to specific groups of people.
The Supreme case.
The term legal fake was first used in reference to a legal case involving the American streetwear company Supreme, and an Italy-based company by the same name. Through this case, several judgments by the Tribunale di Milano have clarified and defined what "legal fake" is.
Supreme Italia was brought to court in 2016 by Supreme New York. The latter company claimed that their trademark and brand image had been damaged.
Judgments and laws.
The existence of a ‘parallel’ Supreme brand was possible due to an ambiguity in the trademark registration process in Italy. Trade Direct Srl (Supreme Italia) filed its application at the UIBM (Italian Patent and Trademark Office) on 18 November 2015 and started producing and selling its products changing little of the original box logo, which was simply made bigger. Supreme NY had registered its trademark on 9 October 2015. 
No new creative elements were added to the legal fake version, as stated by the first judgment from the Tribunale di Milano of 26 January 2017, according to which the Italian company repeatedly used the same brand, advertising images and graphics as the American one. Supreme Italia aimed at targeting a wider range of consumers by looking for more shops and retailers throughout Italy for the products distribution. This process brought Supreme Italia into the spotlight, reaching Supreme NY's attention and leading to the legal case.
After the second judgment of 20 April 2017, the final judgment of 26 January 2018 stated the ‘parasitic’ unfair competition behavior of Trade Direct Srl and its consequences: 120,000 Supreme Italia items had to be withdrawn from the market and the company was to pay €5,500.00 to Supreme NY for fees and legal expenses.
Other cases.
Other brands involved in similar processes include Boy London, Pyrex Vision, and Kith NYC. In all these cases both the brand name and logo, the concept and the items themselves were copied from the original company and sold in another country as if they were the original items, however no legal actions have yet been taken.
Influencers, strategy and cybersquatting.
Legal fakes are possible because they take advantage of the uninformed consumer who can be easily deceived and influenced by the latest trends promoted through celebrities endorsement and social networks or digital platforms.
It's no coincidence that this phenomenon makes use of celebrities endorsement. Indeed, it is now among the most widely used communication strategies which have recently proved to be efficient and able to reach the goal of credibility among consumers. Legal fakes strategy exploits brands fame making their products more easily available on the market and at lower prices unlike the original companies which are niche brands selling limited edition items. A further key point of legal fake related to consumers’ deceit is cybersquatting. This implies the creation of a new website using an almost identical internet domain while adding words such as ‘official’ or ‘original’ which make consumers trust the brand, not knowing it is fake.
Consumer rights.
The question of how consumers can protect themselves from counterfeit and being deceived needs to be mentioned. Information and a corresponding compensation possibility to counterfeit are key points that consumers need to be aware of.
The United Nations General Assembly has itself worked on this issue and provides a list of eight principles.
After J.F. Kennedy employed the term ‘consumer rights’ in his address to the U.S. Congress in 1962, it has been extended to issues dealt by supranational organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations. The latter has adopted in 1985 a set of eight consumer rights as guidelines for consumer protection.
The three most relevant for the topic of legal fake are the following:

Matthew J. Saunders

Matthew J. Saunders (born 5 January 1972) is an English composer, mastering engineer, and visual designer. During the first decade of the 21st century he was signed to 4AD Records — a British major independent label home to The Pixies, Cocteau Twins, Scott Walker and many others. He records and performs as Magnétophone, The Assembled Minds, Rapid Eye Electronics Ltd. and also runs the record label Patterned Air Recordings.
On 4AD, as one half of the art-rock electronic band Magnétophone, Saunders released two albums, three EPs and a 7" single. It was an unusual signing for 4AD, Magnétophone's first album being almost all instrumental, and this departure piqued the interest of journalists and fans of the label and band equally. The band were the first signing after the corporate restructuring of 4AD when co-founder Ivo Watts-Russell departed and the album was seen as a signpost of where the newly reinvented label might be heading
Before signing to 4AD, Saunders released records on several influential record labels including Static Caravan Recordings, Earworm Records, Spaceage Recordings and Ochre Records. He has recorded two Peel Sessions for BBC Radio One, two sessions for BBC Radio One's Rob da Bank, as well as sessions for BBC Radio 3 and XFM.
Saunders has collaborated on record with significant artists such as rock legends Kim Deal and Kelley Deal, Scottish folk legend and Mercury Music Prize nominee King Creosote, infamous drone rock band Spacemen 3's Peter Kember (who also joined Magnétophone as a performing member and manager in 2006–2008), Scottish folk singer/songwriter James Yorkston and others — all tracks that appeared on Magnétophone's second 4AD album, The Man Who Ate the Man or related 12" releases.
He is known for his solo electronic recordings as The Assembled Minds, having released two albums and numerous singles and remixes on a variety of record labels, gaining critical acclaim from magazines such as The Wire and Self-Titled Magazine, from music author and journalist Simon Reynolds, and numerous national radio plays on stations such as BBC Radio 6
Saunders worked on the feature documentary film and is a credited composer on IMDb. He has also had music synced by BBC World News in daily continuity pieces and Sky in cross-network adverts. According to the official website, he is currently composing music for media in addition to running mastering house 808 Hz, where he has mastered albums by artists such as Wire front man Colin Newman, Eva Bowan, Malka Spigel, Anthony Reynolds, and Jon Thorne
In 2007 Saunders contributed a Magnétophone track to a prestigious arts project by New York publishing house Visionaire, a work called Visionaire No. 53: Sound, which saw him appear on record alongside artists such as Yoko Ono, Michael Stipe, U2, Liza Minnelli, Lalo Schifrin, David Byrne, Ad-Rock, Courtney Love and others. Each artist was asked to provide a unique piece of music which was then pressed across five pieces of vinyl and a cd, was housed in a large dome receptical and supplied with a record player in the form of a battery powered car.

Lovelace Health System

Lovelace Health System is a healthcare company which operates six hospitals in New Mexico, five in Albuquerque and one in Roswell. It is one of New Mexico's largest employers with 3,659 employees as of 2020. The company grew out of the Lovelace Clinic founded in 1922, one of the pioneers of group medical practice in the United States. The clinic was best known for conducting physical evaluations of 32 astronaut candidates in 1959 which helped to select the Mercury Seven, the first Americans to travel into space. The clinic also administered testing for an unofficial "women in space" program, during which 13 women—later nicknamed the Mercury 13—were named as prospective astronauts, though they never traveled to space.
From 1947 to 1985, the company was a nonprofit institution owned and operated by the Lovelace Foundation for Medical Education and Research (now a separate entity, Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute). Lovelace was subsequently reorganized as a for-profit hospital network and has been under the ownership of Ardent Health Services since 2002.
History.
The clinic was established in 1922 by William Randolph Lovelace (1883–1968) and his brother-in-law Edgar T. Lassetter (1875–1948), both of whom had originally moved to New Mexico to recover from tuberculosis. In 1946, William Randolph Lovelace II, a nephew of both Lovelace and Lassetter, joined the practice. He had previously worked at the Mayo Clinic and had connections in the aviation industry which helped turn the Lovelace Clinic into a leader in aerospace medicine. Lovelace II quickly took on a leadership role at the clinic and was instrumental in its 1947 reorganization as a nonprofit under the control of the Lovelace Foundation for Medical Education and Research. Another notable physician, Clayton Sam White, was hired as the foundation's first director of research.
In 1950, the clinic moved from its original location on the third floor of the First National Bank Building to a new purpose-built facility at Gibson and Ridgecrest in the Southeast Heights designed by office of John Gaw Meem. By the 1950s, the Lovelace Clinic was considered one of the "Big Six" group practice clinics in the United States along with the Mayo Clinic, Lahey Clinic, Cleveland Clinic, Ochsner Clinic, and Henry Ford Hospital. The medical staff grew from 22 physicians in 1947 to 75 in 1965 and 151 in 1986. In 1959, the clinic conducted physical evaluations of 32 astronaut candidates which helped to select the Mercury Seven, the first Americans to travel into space. At Lovelace II's suggestion, the clinic also administered testing for an unofficial "women in space" program, during which 13 women—later nicknamed the Mercury 13—were named as prospective astronauts, though they never traveled to space.
In 1972, the Lovelace Clinic partnered with the neighboring Bataan Memorial Hospital to launch one of the first two health maintenance organizations (HMOs) in New Mexico, and in 1973 the clinic and hospital merged as the Lovelace Center for the Health Sciences. In 1985, seeking funding to remodel and expand its aging hospital complex, Lovelace reorganized as a for-profit company, Lovelace Inc., which was jointly owned by the Hospital Corporation of America and the Lovelace Foundation. In 1990, HCA's 80% share of the company was acquired by Cigna, which then bought the remaining 20% in 1991. At the time of the sale, Lovelace operated a 235-bed hospital, 16 clinics, and the 120,000-member HMO. Afterwards, the company was no longer affiliated with the Lovelace Foundation, which remains in operation as the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute.
In 2002, the company was purchased by Ardent Health Services, which effected a merger between Lovelace and St. Joseph Hospital. This changed Lovelace's structure from its previous self-contained group practice model to a conventional hospital system, and increased the number of hospitals under its control from one to five. The former St. Joseph Regional Medical Center became the flagship hospital of the system and the original Lovelace hospital closed in 2007.
Hospitals.
Lovelace Medical Center.
Since 2002, the flagship Lovelace hospital has been the Lovelace Medical Center in the Martineztown-Santa Barbara neighborhood of central Albuquerque. The hospital opened in 1902 as St. Joseph Hospital and was expanded with a new building in 1930 which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The current hospital building was completed in 1968 and has 263 licensed beds.
Former hospital.
The original Lovelace Medical Center opened in 1952 as Bataan Memorial Methodist Hospital and was remodeled and expanded in 1987. At the time of its closure in 2007, the hospital had 203 licensed beds. In 2021, the city of Albuquerque purchased the former hospital with the intention of turning it into a "Gateway Center" providing shelter and medical services for people experiencing homelessness.

Jere Behrman

Jere Richard Behrman (born March 2, 1940) is an American economist and the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Economics at the University of Pennsylvania. He belongs to the world's most prominent development and education economists and human capital scholars, with a strong focus on Central and South America.
Biography.
A native of the United States, Jere R. Behrman earned a B.A. in physics from Williams College in 1962, followed by a M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1966 for a thesis on the dynamics of the supply of crops in Thailand between 1937 and 1963. Already before his graduation, Behrman began working at the University of Pennsylvania, with which he has been affiliated throughout his academic career, first as an assistant professor of economics (1965–68), then as associate professor (1968–71), and finally as full professor (since 1971); in 1983, Behrman was honoured with the William R. Kenan Jr. professorship in economics. At the University of Pennsylvania, Behrman additionally serves as an associate director of the Population Aging Research Center, and is a faculty fellow at the Center for the Advanced Study of India, and a research associate at the Population Studies Center, among else. In the past, he has served as director of the Center for Analysis of Developing Economies (1982–95), director of the Population Aging Research Center (1998–99), and director of the Population Studies Center (1998-2005), and chaired the Department of Economics of the University of Pennsylvania (1973–79). Moreover, Behrman performs or has performed editorial duties for the "Journal of Development Economics", "Demography", "Journal of Applied Econometrics", "International Organization", "International Economic Review", "Economics of Education Review", "Asian Development Review", "Journal of Asian Economies", "Journal of Development Studies", "Educational Economics", and the "IZA World of Labor". Finally, he has also worked as consultant for numerous international organizations, including the World Bank, ILO, IADB, ADB, UNDP, and the DfID.
Research.
Jere Behrman's research revolves around the empirical determinants and impacts of human resources such as early childhood development, education, health and nutrition in the presence of unobserved factors (e.g. innate ability or health), the economics of households and imperfect markets, and the economic consequences of imperfect information. As a consequence, a substantial part of Behrman's research involves twin studies. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he belongs to the 1% of highest ranked economists worldwide.
The economics of households.
After early work in agricultural and international economics in developing countries, Behrman turned towards the analysis of households' economic decisions in the mid-1970s. In this area, together with Robert A. Pollak and Paul Taubman, Behrman developed a model for the analysis of parental allocations of resources among their children and finds evidence that U.S. American parents address inequality in their children's earnings by providing more resources to their less able children. Studying whether and how children's order of birth affects how much resources their parents give them, Behrman and Taubman find that parents in the United States give more to firstborns, possibly because of endowment effects, even though they tend to favour later-borns. These differences are then reflected in the relationship between children's birth order and their (age-adjusted) schooling and earnings as young adults. Studying the distribution of food among children within households in rural South India, Behrman finds that parents give preference to their sons when food is scarce, especially among lower caste households, and display only limited aversion for such inequality, thus suggesting that girls may be particularly vulnerable to malnutrition during famines. Using data from rural Pakistan, Behrman, Harold Alderman, Victor Lavy and Rekha Menon analyse the relationship between child health and school enrollment while explicitly modeling child health as determined by household choices in response to unobserved factors such as children's health endowments and find child health (proxied by nutrition) is three times as important for enrollment under that specification.
Using twin experiments, Behrman, Taubman and Mark Rosenzweig find that 27% of the variance in income and 42% of the variance in obesity between individuals in the United States can be explained by individuals' unique endowments. The effect of these individual endowments are further reinforced through schooling, though somewhat diluted as men with high individual endowments tend to marry less educated wives. In another study using twins, Behrman and Rosenzweig find that increasing the schooling of women doesn't increase the schooling of their children once heritable ability and assortative matching are taken into account, and instead reduces the time mothers spent at home.
The determinants and impacts of education, health and nutrition.
Behrman's research on the determinants and impacts of education, health and nutrition (mostly in Latin America) began in the early 1980s. One early theme revolves around nutrition, what it is affected by, and how it in turn affects health, education and earnings. For example, using evidence from south India, Behrman and Anil Deolalikar investigate the relationship between nutrition and income growth and find that the consumption of nutrients is essentially unresponsive to increases in income, even though food expenditure increases more or less in line with income; they conclude that as the poor grow richer, they tend to spend their income on more expensive nutrients rather than simply on more nutrients. Behrman's work on the relationship between health and nutrition in developing countries also features prominently in his and Deolalikar's review of the corresponding literature in the "Handbook of Development Economics". However, though Behrman has called for the provision of public services to improve the health (and nutrition) of poor children based on the conclusion that child health likely has "considerable" effects on adult labour productivity by e.g. improving education, he repeatedly emphasized that the methodological weakness of the literature on the impact of health and nutrition on education (e.g. regarding reverse causality) prevented broader conclusions and called for more research on this issue (in the 1990s). In line with this call, Behrman and Rosenzweig offer evidence that returns in terms of adult schooling attainment (and partly also in terms of higher earnings) to increasing birthweight are high, being underestimated by up to 50% if genetics and family background aren't controlled for. However, they also find that differences in birthweights don't play a large role in determining the world distribution of income. Last, evaluating the impact of improving nutrition during early childhood on education among adults in Guatemala, Behrman, Maluccio, Hoddinott, Martorell, Quisumbing and Stein find that doing so increased the average number of grades completed by women by 1.2 grades as well as both male and female reading comprehension and non-verbal cognitive ability by one quarter standard deviation, thus suggesting that improvements to the nutrient intakes of very young children can have substantial long-term educational impacts.
In a theme often related to nutrition and health, Behrman has conducted research on the determinants and impacts of education, especially in Latin America. One of the most cited examples of such research is his and Nancy Birdsall's critique of education economics' focus on the quantity of schooling at the detriment of schooling's quality. Using evidence on the returns to schooling for young Brazilian men, they find that accounting for differences in the quality of schooling reduces these returns by half, thus suggesting that the social returns to investments into schooling quality may even exceed those to investments into schooling quantity. Moreover, Behrman and Birdsall find that variation in schooling quality partly explains variation in returns to schooling over space and among individuals. Finally, in a prominent programme evaluation, Behrman, Piyali Sengupta and Petra Todd find that the Mexican conditional cash transfer programme PROGRESA, wherein transfers are conditional upon children regularly attending school, effectively reduced dropout rates and facilitates grade progression, especially from primary to secondary school, and thereby increased schooling attainment by on average 0.7 years.

Bailey Olter High School

Bailey Olter High School, formerly Pohnpei Island Central School (PICS), and Pacific Islands Central School, is a senior high school in Kolonia, Pohnpei Island, Pohnpei State, Federated States of Micronesia. the school, operated by the Pohnpei State Department of Education, has about 1,500 students, making it the state's largest high school. Its service area includes Kolonia, Nett, Sokehs (including the FSM capital Palikir), and U.
PICS was the first senior high school on the island of Pohnpei; it was originally the sole senior high school in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and for a period then only secondary school in the Micronesia region.
History.
In 1947 the Mariana Islands' Teacher Training School (MITTS) opened in Guam. MITTS was a normal school serving all areas of the Trust Territory. It moved to Chuuk (Truk) in 1948, to be more central in the Trust Territory, and was renamed Pacific Islands' Teacher Training School (PITTS). The school's function was to develop local Micronesian teaching staff for the Trust Territory.
It transitioned from being a normal school to a comprehensive secondary school, so it was renamed the Pacific Islands Central School. The school moved to Pohnpei in 1959. At the time it was a three-year institution housing students who graduated from intermediate schools.
Additions were built between the late 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, a period when several other public high schools were built in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.

In 1913, he was a member of the crew of the power schooner "Polar Bear", which took part in a scientific expedition in the Arctic Circle. The "Polar Bear" froze in the ice near Flaxman Island (halfway between Herschel Island and Point Barrow). The crew disembarked and walked to Circle City. From there, they went to Fairbanks and then to Valdez, where they took a steamer to Seattle. In 1915 he graduated from Harvard College. After college, he spent two years as a mechanic at the Draper Corporation.

While serving in France, Draper met Red Cross worker Ruth Lawrence Carroll. The couple married on August 30, 1919 in Paul Smiths, New York. They resided at The Ledges, the former home of Draper's father, in Hopedale, Massachusetts. The couple had one daughter, Nancy, born on August 28, 1922. On July 24, 1926, Ruth Draper was granted a divorce in Paris on the ground of desertion. She was awarded custody of their daughter. 
On November 12, 1926, Draper married Hazel Archibald in Rutherford, New Jersey. After their marriage, Draper tore down "The Ledges" and build a new mansion (also known as "The Ledges") for her. In October 1935, Hazel Draper suffered a mental breakdown following an operation. On April 18, she had left the Four Winds Sanitarium in Katonah, New York, where she had been staying for four months.

Boothi Vikramakesari

Boothi Vikramakesari was a Velir Irukkuvel chieftain and a feudatory of the medieval Cholas. He is best remembered for building the Moovar Koil temple complex, a collection of "Three temples" in the village of Kodumbalur, 36 kilometres from Pudukkottai in Tamil Nadu, India. His family was related to the Cholas by marriage. His mother was a Chola princess while his daughter married Chola prince Arindama.
Dating.
Some scholars and historians identify him as a contemporary of Parantaka I while some others like Venkayya identify him as a sub-ordinate of Sundara Chola Parantaka II. It is more likely that he was a feudatory of Parantaka I as a daughter of his, namely Boothi Aditya Pidaari was married to Arikulakesari, the younger son of Parantaka I.
Moreover, the chief and his family members figure in inscriptions of the Pallava King Vijaya Nandivikramavarman and later in inscriptions of Aditya I, so he seems to have initially been a sub-ordinate of the Pallava King and then a feudatory of the Chola King Aditya I after the latter overthrew the former's son Aparajita. Subsequently, he seems to have continued in service of Aditya I's son Parantaka I. Consequently, his period can be fixed between the latter half of 9th century and beginning of the 10th century.
Personal life.
The chief's given name was Boothi and he earned the title "Vikramakesari" through his exploits. He is also called as "Tennavan Ilangovel" and "Parantaka Ilangovelir" in inscriptions. He was born to Irukkuvel chieftain Samarabirama and Chola princess Anupama. Samarabirama is called "Yadu vamsa kethu" that is the "Banner of the Yadu race" in the Moovar Koil inscription Two queens of his are known from the same inscription, namely, Nangai Varaguna Perumanar and Karrali. As mentioned earlier, a daughter of his, namely Boothi Aditya Pidaari was married to Arikulakesari, the younger son of Parantaka I. She is known from an inscription from a temple at Tiruchendurai.
Inscriptions.
An excerpt of the Moovar Koil inscription is as follows,
Another inscription from the period of Pallava King Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman from Kilur, Tirukovilur taluk, South Arcot district. The script and language of the inscription is in Tamil and paleographically the inscription can be dated to the 9th century,
The following is another inscription from Ghrithasthaneswara temple in Tillasthanam, figuring the queen of Boothi Vikramakesari from the period of Aditya I,
It is of interest to note that among the boundaries mentioned in the above inscription there is an embankment called Karikala-karai.

<doc id="56667065" url="?curid=56667065" title="Golden Tour">
Golden Tour

The Golden Tour was the fifteenth concert tour by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue. It was launched in support of her fourteenth studio album, "Golden" (2018) and visited Europe and Australia. It began on 18 September 2018 in Newcastle, England at the Metro Radio Arena and concluded on 17 March 2019 in Mount Cotton, Australia at Sirromet Wines. The tour was first announced in February 2018, consisting of dates in the UK and Ireland. The previously announced European leg was incorporated into the tour in September of the same year, and the Australian leg was announced in November.
The concerts were divided into seven distinct sections: "Desert Sunrise", "The High &amp; Dry", "Nothing Behind Me, Everything Ahead of Me", "The Lovers United", "At the Picnic After the Biker Rally", "New York City" and an encore, "The Nashville Rider." An interval halfway through the show separated the concert into two halves. Acting as creative director alongside Rob Sinclair, Minogue created a show narrative that was set in the 1970s and heavily influenced by Western films, featuring an abstract road movie which was presented on a large video screen. The retro influence of the concerts were also amplified by a "g"-shaped stage with a glittered runway. The tour received acclaim from music critics, who praised the shows for their simplicity in comparison to Minogue's previous tours.
The Golden Tour was also commercially successful. According to "Billboard", the three concerts in London, England at The O2 Arena grossed $3,368,900 with 30,100 tickets sold, placing her at eighth spot for the biggest concerts of September 2018. Footage from the tour was also filmed across several nights, and was released on 6 December 2019 as "Golden Live in Concert".
Background.
In February 2018, Minogue announced a series of concerts in smaller venues as part of the Kylie Presents Golden tour, to coincide with the expected release of the album. Later the same month, a new arena tour was announced with UK and Ireland dates being confirmed. Discussing the development process of the tour, Minogue stated:
In an interview on "Good Morning Britain", Minogue explained that the shows would be split into "two halves", with an interval and a narrative throughout. She continued to say the setlist was mostly concrete at that point, mentioning "Raining Glitter" and "Lost Without You" as definite performances. Minogue’s costumes for the tour were designed by Ralph &amp; Russo, Kolchagov Barba, Paco Rabanne, Jitrois, Stevie Stewart and Wrangler.
Shortly before the tour commenced in September, Sonic Yootha were announced as the support act for the UK and Ireland dates, and the previously announced European dates of the Kylie Presents Golden promotional tour would be incorporated into the Golden Tour. On 7 November, Minogue announced six Australian dates for the Golden Tour, three of which were part of the "A Day on the Green" festival.
Synopsis.
The first act of the show "Desert Sunrise" opened with a guitar instrumental and a howling wind sound effect, showing a projection of a desert at night. A troupe of dancers in cowboy outfits walked onto the stage as the sun began to rise, before Minogue rose out of the floor sat atop of a stack of luggage, singing "Golden". Lights brightened to reveal the "g"-shaped staging and a "glittering golden runway", and Minogue then performed "Get Outta My Way" and "Better the Devil You Know". "One Last Kiss" was performed at the opening night in Newcastle, but removed from the set list after.
The second section "The High &amp; Dry" began with an interlude of "Blue Velvet", with the video screen showing Minogue singing the song at a bar. She emerged, dressed in an all-white ensemble, to continue the rest of the song. Minogue then performed "Confide in Me" and "I Believe in You", in place of "Breathe" (performed only at Newcastle). A short acapella of "Where the Wild Roses Grow" was then performed as Minogue passes a rose through the crowd to the back of the venue, followed by "In Your Eyes". The second act concluded with a performance of "A Lifetime to Repair", with the singer stood atop of a pool table surrounded by her dancers.
The third section "Nothing Behind Me, Everything Ahead of Me" began with a performance of "Shelby '68" and "Radio On", with Minogue explaining the backstory behind both songs to the audience. A rendition of "Wow" was then performed, followed by a mash-up of "Can't Get You Out of My Head" and "The Chain". During this, Minogue wore a bespoke denim jacket, with an image of her and the name of the city being performed in embroidered into the back. A telephone box prop near the stage ramp began to ring and the lights dimmed, indicating the start of the twenty-minute interval. During which, a giant silver disco ball illuminated the venue.
After the interval, the dancers rose from the stage atop of illuminated motorcycles and Minogue appeared at the top of the stage ramp. She performed "Slow", starting the fourth section of the show, "At the Biker Rally". Minogue and her backing vocalists then went on to perform "Kids", before the lights were dimmed and a rendition of "The One" was performed. Minogue then sang "Stop Me from Falling", where the section concluded.
The fifth section, "At the Picnic After the Biker Rally", began with a medley of "Wouldn't Change a Thing" and "I'll Still Be Loving You", where Minogue performed whilst moving around the stage with a male dancer, followed by "Especially for You". She then performed "Lost Without You", complete with a laser show, and "All the Lovers". The section finished with the conclusion of this song, following the use of rainbow coloured lights and multiple confetti drops.
The video screens then displayed the logo of the penultimate "Studio 54" section, with Minogue entering through the stage doors wearing a bespoke golden dress, featuring 120,000 Preciosa crystals. She performed a medley consisting of then-unreleased song "New York City", "Raining Glitter" and "On a Night Like This". A chugging stream train sound effect then followed, as Minogue performed a disco rendition of "The Loco-Motion". Concluding the section, "Spinning Around" was performed, with golden ribbons fired across the audience.
Minogue then thanked the audience and vacated the stage with her dancers, as the lights dimmed. The video screen showed a blue, sparkling background before Minogue reappeared and began the encore of the show, "The Nashville Rider", performing "Love at First Sight". Minogue then performed an extended version of the album's lead single, "Dancing", and concluded the show by thanking her team and audience and exiting through the stage doors.
Critical reception.
The tour has gained acclaim from music critics. Simon Duke from "The Evening Chronicle" gave the opening night in Newcastle five stars with a positive review, saying that "Kylie dazzled in front of a set with visuals that looked like they’d been lifted straight from a picture perfect postcard of the Wild West". Duke stated that the "well executed and deliciously camp choreography [...] is a must see", being one of the best pop shows "ever experienced".
Adrian Caffery from "The Birmingham Mail" gave the Birmingham date 4 stars, stating that it was a "rollercoaster concert showcasing 30 years of Kylie [that] failed to disappoint", yet noted "there was a lot less spectacle than in previous Kylie concerts, with the extravagant stages [...] replaced by giant video screens." He concluded that "Kylie turned 50 this year, and on this evidence it’s clear she still has the Midas' touch."
Jack Hardwick from "The Daily Star" stated that "the pint-sized singer looked hotter than ever as she belted out some of her biggest hits" whilst "wowing fans with her killer vocals and [...] sex appeal. For the opening London date at The O2 Arena, Hardwick gave the show 4 stars, stating that Minogue "wowed fans with a stellar set-list of her biggest hits and a healthy smattering of new album tracks". He commented positively on the simplicity of the show, saying that "Kylie doesn’t need to rely on larger-than-life sets and jaw-dropping water spectacles to put on a killer show". Hardwick went on to praise Minogue's "faultless" vocals, concluding that "the show [was a] nostalgic trip down memory lane [...] [with] disco classics in the form of On a Night Like This, The Loco-Motion, Spinning Around and Love at First Sight." Gemma Sandways of "The Evening Standard" reviewed the same show, giving it 4 stars and stating that "there was a healthy helping of glamour [...] from the glittering gowns to the giant disco ball and metallic streamers unleashed". She concluded by saying that the "performance served as a welcome reminder of Minogue’s generosity as a performer, and of the refreshing lack of cynicism with which she has always embraced all eras of her career".

AImotive

AImotive (formerly AdasWorks) is an autonomous vehicle technology company. The company aims works with automotive manufacturers and Tier1s to enable automated technologies. AImotive describes its approach as "vision-first", a system that primarily relies on cameras and artificial intelligence to detect its surroundings. The technology is designed to be implemented by automobile manufacturers to create autonomous vehicles, which can operate in all conditions and locations. In September 2017, PSA Group teamed up with AImotive.
History.
The company was founded in Budapest, Hungary as AdasWorks by Laszlo Kishonti in 2015. AImotive is a spin-off of the founder's previous company, Kishonti Ltd, which was a computer hardware benchmarking company. In November 2016, the company changed its name to AImotive.
The company has closed four venture capital investment rounds. The first investment round of $2,500,000 was announced on 15 May 2015 and was led by Inventure Oy. In a second round of funding the company received $10.5 million in funding from Robert Bosch Venture Capital, Draper Associates, Nvidia, Tamares Group and others. On 4 January 2018 AImotive announced a Series C round of $38 million funded by investors B Capital Group, Prime Ventures and others. This round made AImotive the second largest Hungarian-based startup based on venture capital investment. In May 2020 the company announced a fourth investment round of 20 million USD. The injection was led by earlier investors. AImotive outlined plans to expand with offices in Detroit (Michigan, US) and Munich (Germany).
AImotive first created a prototype which it tested on the Hungarian Formula 1 Grand Prix track, Hungaroring. 
The company received its first public road test license in Finland in Spring 2017. AImotive has similar test licenses in Hungary, the State of California, and the State of Nevada. As of January 2018, the company tests its technology on Toyota, Citroen and Volvo models. 
The company's headquarters remained in Hungary. AImotive has offices in Mountain View, California and Yokohama Japan.In 2016 Nvidia confirmed it was working with AImotive (AdasWorks at the time) and Volvo within the DriveMe project. In September 2017 AImotive and PSA Groupe announced a partnership to develop a highway autopilot. The same year AImotive announced it was developing an artificial intelligence accelerator, branded as aiWare. AImotive partnered with VeriSilicon and GlobalFoundries to create test chips of the architecture for use in its prototypes. At the Consumer Electronics Show 2018 the Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center announced its DRVLINE platform in which AImotive is listed as a software technology partner.
AImotive was listed as a partner of Sony's Vision-S concept car at CES 2021. The company subsequently announced it was creating L2+ automated driving systems for the concept vehicle.
Technology.
AImotive is developing three branches of technology connected to autonomous vehicles. aiDrive is a software stack for automated driving. aiSim is a virtual simulation environment, and aiWare, a silicon IP for chips that compute artificial intelligence.
aiDrive utilizes artificial intelligence and data from cameras and other sensors. AImotive focuses on processing visual information, this approach is similar to that of Tesla, which some industry experts consider risky. The company tests its technology on highways in the United States and Europe. 
aiSim is a virtual simulation environment for testing autonomous vehicles. In spring 2020 AImotive announced that the simulator had received ISO 26262 tool certification to TCL3.
The hardware architecture by AImotive is a dedicated embedded artificial intelligence accelerator optimized for but not limited to computer vision with high-resolution input. In 2020 the company announced that it was collaborating with Hungarian space technology startup C3S to create neural network acceleration platforms for applications in space. aiWare has also been integrated into NextChip's Apache5 imaging edge processor for automotive applications.
AImotive in popular media.
AImotive was featured on the British television show Guy Martin vs The Robot Car which aired on 26 November 2017. In the show, British motorcycle racer and television personality Guy Martin visits the company's headquarters and participates in a test drive on a Hungarian Motorway.
In December 2020, AImotive CEO, László Kishonti participated in an online international panel discussion about the future of artificial intelligence with renowned researchers such as Niel deGrasse Tyson, Stuart J. Russell, George Tilesch, and György Buzsáki.

Portobello Power Station

Portobello Power Station was a coal-fired power station in Portobello, Edinburgh which was built in 1923 by the Edinburgh Corporation in order to cope with the increasing demand for electricity in the city. Although originally intended to be built in 1913, its construction was delayed because of the First World War, and it was formally opened by George V ten years later. Its electricity was used to power Edinburgh and the surrounding region while waste heat warmed the water of Portobello Open Air Pool.
In 1938 the design of the station was extended by Edinburgh architect Ebenezer MacRae; its six individual chimneys were replaced with a single 365 feet tall stack, which weighed 10,000 tons, was made up of 710,000 bricks and cost in the region of £118,000 to build. 
Between 1952 and 1955, the power station achieved the highest thermal efficiency of any station in the UK, with peak output of around 279 megawatts, although an explosion in February 1953 led to a two-hour power blackout across Edinburgh. The explosion, which could be heard a mile away, was caused by sea spray collecting on high-voltage insulators in the main-grid substation.
The power station closed on 31 March 1977 and demolished in 1980; a new housing estate was built on the site. During demolition, the chimney had to be taken down brick by brick because of its proximity to nearby houses.
The Portobello coat of arms on the power station was rescued during demolition and it was planned to incorporate it into a new sports centre to be built in the area. This never happened and in 2016 the broken coat of arms was located in a council storage facility in the west of Edinburgh.

Bobak (Slavic demon)

Bobak is a demonic creature in Slavic mythology.
Forms.
There are several ways of portraying bobak in Slavic culture. Some people believed that it was a bogeyman of some unspecified features, sometimes taking the form of a white dog or a cat. In the south-eastern region of Łódź bobak was said to be the name of so-called "odmieniec" and it was considered to be a child replaced by a demoness boginka-mamuna What differentiated the demon from one's progeny were its taciturnity, nonmotility and the lack of appetite, at least when home-dwelers were present. Left alone at home, bobaks were voracious, liked also booze. When such a demonic child grew up, it used to be handicapped and mistrustful of people, but it happened rarely as they used to die in their infancy. According to some sources from Wieluń, in turn, bobaks were mischievous dwarves, while in the region of Kutno they were believed to be small devils or diabolic children.

Vanderbilt rape case

The Vanderbilt rape case refers to a case in Nashville, Tennessee, United States, in which on June 23, 2013, four Vanderbilt University football players carried an unconscious 21-year-old female student into a dorm room, gang-raped and sodomized her, photographed and videotaped her, and one urinated on her face.
Three of the rapists were convicted, and received prison sentences ranging from 15 years, the minimum allowed by Tennessee law for their crimes, to 17 years. The fourth player accepted a plea deal which included 10 years' probation, and did not receive any jail time.
Rape.
On June 23, 2013, four Vanderbilt Commodores football team players, Brandon Vandenburg, Cory Lamont Batey, Brandon E. Banks, and Jaborian "Tip" McKenzie carried an unconscious 21-year-old female student into a dorm room in the school's Gilette House dorm. They gang-raped and sodomized her, slapped her, inserted their fingers in her, and sat on her face as she was on the floor in a 32-minute attack. They took over 40 graphic photos, and took videos of the rape with the cell phones of Vanderburg, Batey, and Banks. The victim (who is white) told the court that after Batey (who is black) raped her, he urinated on her face while saying she deserved what he was doing to her because of the color of her skin, saying what sources reported was "That’s for 400 years of slavery you b----."
Case.
The players were dismissed from the football team on June 29, 2013, and banned from campus during the six-week investigation that followed. On August 9, 2013, they were arrested and indicted for aggravated rape and sexual battery. All four men were charged with five counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual battery. 
In July 2016, after being convicted by a Davidson County Criminal Court jury, Batey, 22 years old, received a 15-year prison sentence, the minimum allowed by law for his crimes (while both the victim and prosecutors had asked the judge for the maximum sentence possible of 25 years to be meted out); after he gets out he will be required to be listed on the sex-offender registry for the rest of his life. He is serving his time in Riverbend Maximum Security Institution.
In November 2016, after being convicted Vanderburg was sentenced to 17 years in prison; after he gets out he will be required to be listed on the sex-offender registry for the rest of his life. He is serving his time in Morgan County Correctional Complex.
In August 2017, after being convicted Banks received a 15-year sentence; after he gets out he will be required to be listed on the sex-offender registry for the rest of his life. He is serving his time in Turney Center Industrial Complex.
In March 2018, after testifying against his three co-defendants and pleading guilty to facilitation of aggravated rape, McKenzie, 23 years old, accepted a plea deal which included 10 years' probation and a lifetime registration as a sex offender, and became the only of the four defendants to not receive any jail time. He was not seen touching the victim after he helped his teammates carry her into the dorm room.
A fifth player, Chris Boyd, pleaded guilty in September 2013 to being an accessory after the fact by encouraging his teammates to keep quiet and destroy evidence of the rape, and was dismissed from the team but not the university for his role in helping cover up the rape. He testified against Vandenberg and Batey as part of a plea deal, and was sentenced to a year of unsupervised probation. 
Appeals by Batey, Vanderburg, and Banks to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals in efforts to have their convictions overturned were unsuccessful in 2019. In 2020, the Tennessee Supreme Court declined to reconsider Vandenburg's appeal of his conviction.

Prague–Kbely Airport

Prague–Kbely Airport (Czech: "letiště Praha–Kbely") (ICAO: LKKB) is a military airport located in Kbely, in the northeast municipal district of Prague, Czech Republic. Once Prague's principal airport, it is now used mainly as a military base for the Czech Air Force. It is very close to Letňany Airport, located to the northwest, which has two green runways and is used these days as a venue for air shows and other events.
Kbely airfield is no longer used as a front-line Czech Air Force base, but it is utilised by military transport aircraft of the Czech Air Force, and the VIP aircraft which are used to transport Czech politicians. Prague Aviation Museum is also located at this airport, with a collection that includes 275 aircraft.
History.
Kbely Airport was built in 1918 and was Prague's only airport until the construction of Ruzyně Airport in 1937, on the northwest side of the city. It was the first Czechoslovak military airfield, and during the inter-war period was the venue for several major public air shows. Between 1918 and 1937, it served commercial aviation and was home base of Czechoslovak Airline (ČLS) and Czechoslovak Airlines (ČSA; now Czech Airlines). The first scheduled flight operated by Czechoslovak Airlines departed from Kbely for Bratislava in October 1923.

Roberta Pinna

Roberta Pinna, is an Italian national contemporary art artist and art adviser whose work explores gender, sexuality and identity in the signature palette of gentle tones and monochrome. She is most known for her paintings of flying silhouettes. Pinna is widely associated with the re-emergence of the figurative and decorative in contemporary art.
Career.
Roberta Pinna studied in Italy, France, and at the School of Visual Arts in New York.
"My figures are semi-realistically rendered symbolic representations of the contemporary canonic form of the feminine. My approach to work is minimalist and tended to synthesize elements and forms."
Work.
Roberta Pinna is most widely known for her silhouettes and divers illustrated in a minimalist style. The process of Pinna's work is in the application of a great number of thin paint layers to create the silky, gentle surface that she is known for. Each work is the result of a meditative but rigorous process of applying a layer of color several times to capture a specific tone that recalls an hour, a season, and the weather. Her colour choice is designed to evoke this effect of being suspended in time watching the sky whilst her choice of material and subject are typically indicative of Minimalism.
Featured collections.
Pinna's work has been requested for key collections. Her work is featured in a range of public and private collections, including Rizzoli Publishing, Amazon, Fiat Chrysler, (Sergio Marchionne, automotive executive for Chrysler and Fiat purchased Pinna's painting "Serendipity" through personal viewing for his private collection), J.P. Morgan, P&amp;O Cruises.
Pinna's work "Aquarium" was chosen by Rizzoli Publishing as the cover image for the posthumous book of Italian actress Anna Marchesini'“ E’ Arrivato l’Arrotino”' The aquamarine piece is one which depicts Pinna's signature diving figures.

Officers' Skat

Officers' Skat ("Offiziersskat"), is a trick-taking card game for two players which is based on the rules of Skat. It may be played with a German or French pack of 32 cards which, from the outset of the game, are laid out in rows both face down and face up. As in Skat, tricks are taken and card points counted to determine the winner of a round; game points are then awarded to decide the winner of a game. It is also called Two-hand Skat ("Zweimann-Skat" or "Skat zu zweit"), Sailors' Skat ("Seemannsskat"), Farmers' Skat ("Bauernskat"), Robbers' Skat ("Räuberskat") or Coachmen's Skat ("Kutscherskat")
There are several local variations of the card game, which differ mainly in the number of cards revealed or hidden and the calculation of points.
Method of play.
The game is played between two players, each of whom has two rows of cards placed face down and two rows of cards placed face up on top of them. Thus each player has his 16 cards laid out in two rows of cards facing him, each row containing four pairs of cards, the top cards being face up. The players then play for 16 tricks. Players may agree to play with a trump suit (the game is then known as "Suit"; German: "Farbenspiel"), without a trump suit ("Grand") or without any trumps at all ("Ramsch"). A "Null" game ("Nullspiel"), as in normal Skat, may be also possible depending on the rules.
Dealing.
The dealer shuffles the cards and his opponent – the forehand ("Vorhand"), elder hand ("Ältere") or declarer ("Ansager") – cuts them. The dealer then deals a row of four cards, face down, to the forehand and four to himself. Next, the forehand is given four cards face up on top of his first row of face down cards. Now forehand chooses a suit (Bells, Hearts, Leaves or Acorns) as the trump suit.
After the trump suit has been declared, the dealer deals four cards to himself, face up, on top of his first row. He may double the stakes by saying "Kontra!" if he believes his opponent cannot win. The remaining 16 cards are then dealt; four face down to each player making a second row and then four face up to each player on top of them. (see variations). If the dealer has said "kontra" after receiving his first four face-up cards, the forehand can answer "Re!" after receiving his second row of face-up cards thus re-doubling the stakes and indicating that he thinks "he" will win the game.
Trumps.
As in Skat, one of the four suits is nominated as the trump suit in addition to the jacks (French card pack) or "Unters" (German card pack). Alternatively the players can play "Grand" and only use the jacks/"Unters" as trumps. As in "Suit" in Skat, the four jacks/"Unters" are the highest trumps in the order: Clubs/Acorns, Spades/Leaves, Hearts and Diamonds/Bells. Then follow the Ace/Deuce, King, Queen/"Ober", 9, 8 and 7 of the chosen trump suit.
The trump suit sets the game value at 24 (Grand), 12 (acorns), 11 (leaves), 10 (hearts) or 9 (bells) points. There is also the option to choose "Ramsch" i.e. the winner is the player with the fewest points.
Cards in the trump suit are ordered as follows:
The Jack of Clubs/"Unter" of Acorns is the highest-ranking card in a "Suit" game and is called in German "der Alte" ("the old man").
The non-trump suit cards are ranked A-10-K-Q-9-8-7 (or A-10-K-O-9-8-7 for the German pack respectively).
Playing.
The player who has chosen trumps, the declarer, starts the game by leading to the first trick with one of his face-up cards. The player going second must 'follow suit' if possible. If a player is unable to follow suit, i.e. he is 'skat' or 'blank', he can throw down a card (give up a card of his choice) or in the case of having no cards of the same suit left, he may trump it (play a trump and win the card). The rules are the same as those for "Suit", "Grand" and "Ramsch" in Skat.
After each trick, any exposed face down cards are flipped. The winner of the trick leads to the next trick.
Counting and scoring.
The game ends when all 16 tricks have been taken; then both players add up their 'card points' from the cards they have won. The game is won by the player who has amassed the most card points. Because the total value of all the cards is 120 card points, a winning score is 61 or more card points. The cards have the same values as in Skat: 11, 10, 4, 3 and 2 points (Ace, 10, King, "Ober", "Unter"), the cards 7, 8 and 9 do not count. If both players score 60 card points, then the player who did not choose trumps is the winner.
The declarer receives 'game points' according to his win or loss. These are calculated as in normal Skat. First the number of matadors ("Spitzen") is calculated. This is the either the number of Jacks or "Unters" held in unbroken sequence, beginning with the Jack of Clubs or "Unter" of Acorns or, alternatively, the number "not held" in unbroken sequence. The number of matadors plus one is then multiplied by the base value of the trump suit (Bells: 9, Hearts: 10, Leaves: 11, Acorns: 12 or Grand: 24). For example, if Bells are trumps and the declarer holds the "Unters" of Acorns, Leaves and Hearts, but not Bells, his score is (3+1) x 9 = 36. If his opponent has won less than 30 card points (i.e. he is "in the "Schneider"") or even no card points at all (i.e. he is "black" or "Schwarz"), the declarer doubles or quadruples his game points accordingly ("Schneider": double; "Schwarz": four times). If the declarer loses, he deducts twice the number of game points he would have won.
Note that, as in Skat, game points are quite separate from card points; card points determine whether the declarer wins or loses, whereas game points determine how much is won or lost.
Many people calculate the points using additional matadors ("Spitzen") as in Skat, so that in a game with all four Jacks and the Ace of trumps, the winner gets 5 matador points for a game value of 6 times the base value. The same goes for the calculation of "Unters" or Jacks not held.
In addition there are also simplified forms of scoring:
Variations.
Passing.
If agreed, a game can also be played where players can 'pass' instead of choosing trumps. If the actual declarer passes, the dealer can choose trumps once both players have four cards, face up, before them. If both players pass, the game is played as "Ramsch", i.e. the is to get the lowest score.
Harlequin Skat.
The feature of Harlequin Skat is the fact that a player only sees half his own cards, but also half of his opponent's. His opponent cannot see any of those cards, but can see all the others.
The advantages of harlequin skat are that you need less space to play it, and a greater tactical depth because you know your opponent's cards before they are seen. 
The same rules apply as in Officers' Skat. However, the cards are not distributed on the table, but held in the hand as follows:
The cards are placed in a pile in the middle. Players now take turns drawing one card at a time. The first card is picked up normally. The second card is not viewed, but placed behind the other, so that it is only visible by the opponent. The third card is then picked up 'normally' again, the fourth is placed facing away behind the third, and so on. Players may say: "One to see, one to turn!" to help them remember this. The players pick up their first eight cards, of which they will hold four face up, normally; and the remaining four turned to face away and so only seen by their opponent. The starting player now calls trumps. Then the remaining cards are drawn in the same fashion, so that now both players see eight of their own cards and eight of their opponent's. When a card is played, the card facing the opponent may then be turned over.
In addition, after each player has received eight cards (four face down, four open), the rest may be dealt as in a normal hand (face up to the player); this is called a 'half-open' ("halb-offenes") game.
Admirals' Skat.
In Admirals' Skat, each player is given five cards face down, five face up and five in their hand. The remaining two cards are set aside as the skat or 'stock' ("Stock"). The trump suit and who plays first is then determined as usual in Skat with bidding. This variant is also called "with bidding" ("mit Reizen").
Name.
According to Grupp (1975), the name Officers' Skat ("Offiziers-Skat" ) came from the fact that "officers only socialised with the men when they were in the barracks, but not at the skat table, so often there was no third man." As a result, a variation of skat for two players was derived.
The name Coachman's Skat ("Kutscherskat") comes from the fact that coachmen were supposed to have whiled away their waiting time with this game, while their gentlemen went off to a social event, there being often 2 coachmen (including the postilion) per coach. The cards were laid out between the coaches on the coach box.

Mechanisms of the English common law

In the English system of common law, judges have devised a number of mechanisms to allow them to cope with precedent decisions.
Issues of the common law.
According to Montesquieu, it is Parliament that has the rightful power to legislate, not the judiciary. The legal fiction is that judges do not make law, they merely "declare it". Thus, common law is declaratory, and this is often retrospective in effect. For example, see "Shaw v DPP" and "R v Knuller" In the search for justice and fairness, there is a tension between the needs for, on one hand, predictability and stability, and "up-to date law", on the other.
There is a hierarchy of courts, and a hierarchy of decisions. All lower courts are bound by the judgments from higher courts; and higher courts are not bound by decisions from lower courts.
With one exception, courts of record are bound by their own precedent decisions. The House of Lords used to be bound by its own decisions, but in 1966 it issued a Practice Direction declaring that it would no longer feel so constrained; the Supreme Court is similarly free to depart from earlier decisions. By contrast, the Court of Appeal is bound by its own decisions, although for a period Lord Denning, MR, acted as though it were not. Inferior courts are not strictly courts of record, but some, such as employment tribunals methodically report their own cases, and have built up a specialist body of common law. Courts such as the magistrates court cannot establish precedent.
Even if a court is bound to observe a precedent decision, it does not follow that the whole of the judgment is binding. One must distinguish between "ratio decidendi" and "obiter dicta". "Ratio decidendi" is the "reason for the decision", and forms the crux of the cases; whereas "obiter dicta" is "other things that are said", i.e. matters said in passing, judicial asides, hypothetical issues, and broad issues. "Ratio decidendi" is binding on other courts, whereas "obiter dicta" is persuasive only.
An effective test to see if a part of the judgment is "ratio" or "obiter" is "Wambaugh's Inversion Test", whereby one must invert the question, and ask, "would the decision have been different without this part of the judgment?". In other words, ask, "Is it crucial?". If not, it is "obiter dicta".
If a judgment establishes a broad principle of law, then strictly speaking that principle is too wide to be said to be "ratio decidendi". Nevertheless, if that broad principle is approved and applied by later courts, then the principle will eventually be treated as "ratio". A particular example is the broad "neighbour principle", enunciated by Lord Atkin in "Donoghue v Stevenson" 1932, which has become the basis of the modern law of negligence. When judges may face conflicting precedents, they may select the preferable case.
Dissenting judgments are not "ratio", and so must be "obiter". Sometimes, with the passage of time, more attention is given to the dissenting judgment that to the majority judgment. Scottish decisions (and decisions from the USA and common law jurisdictions in the Commonwealth) are, like "obiter dicta", merely persuasive in England.
The mechanisms.
If faced with a binding judicial precedent, a court has a number of ways to respond to it, and may use the following legal devices and mechanisms:

A. M. Bakalar (born 3 March 1975, birth name: Joanna Zgadzaj) is a Polish author, writing in English. Her novels are "Madame Mephisto" (2012) and "Children of Our Age" (2017).
Early life.
Bakalar was born in Wroclaw, Poland. She studied at the University of Wroclaw, Poland, from which she graduated with a BA and MA in English Literature. In 2004 she emigrated to the UK. Between 2007 and 2011 she was a PhD student of postcolonial studies and comparative literature at Birkbeck College, University of London and University of Southampton. Bakalar wrote the draft of her first novel during her PhD studies.

Her first book, a novel "Madame Mephisto", was published in April 2012. The novel was well received by the critics. In "The Times Literary Supplement", Max Liu noted “Bakalar…captures how isolating London can be for newcomers,” while Lucy Popescu, writing in the "Huffington Post" called it “a darkly-comic account of a Polish immigrant’s experiences in London.” The book was a reader nomination for the 2012 Guardian First Book Award.
Her second novel, "Children of Our Age", published in October 2017, is an exploration of modern-day human trafficking by Poles living in the UK. The novel received a starred review in "Publishers Weekly" which called it “enthralling” and praised it “skillful storytelling.” Mary Rodgers, writing for the "Los Angeles Review of Books", called it an “unflinching yet ultimately compassionate second novel” and “an ambitious work of great scope and power.” In the "Times Literary Supplement", Ania Ready noted “A novel about the power of language to estrange and, occasionally, connect.”
She lives in London, UK.

Best of My Love (album)

Best of My Love is the third studio album by Australian singer Samantha Jade, released through Sony Music Australia on 20 April 2018. It is her second album of covers after her debut album "Samantha Jade" (2012).
Background.
On 10 January 2018, CEO of Sony Music Australia Denis Handlin confirmed that a concept album was due to be released by Jade later in 2018.
In a press release on 22 February 2018, Jade announced the release of the album and stated that “"Best of My Love" was such a fun record to make. I hope it reignites the passion for all disco lovers and helps tell the story of this exciting genre to a whole new audience that may not have experienced the lifestyle first-hand. It’s such an honor to pay tribute to some of the most iconic divas such as Donna Summer, Cher and Diana Ross. I’ve always been inspired by disco, soul funk and dance, particularly the female voices that emerged during this time.” The same month, Jade discussed her inspiration behind the album with "Sydney Morning Herald": "I was really excited about this musical I had seen in London, , I don't know how many times I went back to see it," she says. "I was so obsessed with the story of Diana Ross and I went away from it and listened to more of her music and loved it."
Reception.
David from auspOp said "on first listen, the album doesn’t throw in any surprises and comes across quite flat", adding that "on the majority of songs, things feel polished but a bit too mellow. That being said, when Samantha connects to a song and is given the ability to let loose, she hits a home run." David named "I Feel Love", "Hot Stuff" and original tracks "Roller Skates" and "Let Me Love You" as the best tracks on the album.
Jeff Jenkins from Stack Magazine said "the tracklist doesn't take too many chances... but Jade's voice – breezy and bright – is perfectly suited to the euphoric and exuberant sound. The album concludes with a couple of impressive originals."
Haydon Benfield from Renowned for Sound said "Over its fourteen tracks and forty-seven minutes, "Best of My Love" fails to do anything exciting and a bit more of an adventurous streak would have served Jade well."

General-law municipality

In the systems of local government in some U.S. states, a general-law municipality, general-law city, code city, or statutory city is a municipality whose government structure and powers are defined by the general law of its state. This is contrast to a charter city or home-rule city, whose government structure and powers are defined by a municipal charter.
States may allow only general-law municipalities, only charter municipalities, or both. In states having both, general-law municipalities generally have less autonomy than charter municipalities do. Five states do not allow municipal charters, meaning that every municipality is a general-law municipality. Other states may allow or require charters for all municipalities or may allow charters only for municipalities meeting certain criteria, requiring other municipalities to be general-law municipalities.
California.
In California, a general-law city has only those powers expressly granted or necessarily incident to those expressly granted. Any fair, reasonable doubt is resolved against the exercise of such powers. A general-law city may have only a form of government authorized by state general law.
Michigan.
In Michigan, villages can be general-law villages, governed under the General Law Village Act (Act 3 of 1895), or home-rule villages having charters.
Minnesota.
In Minnesota, cities are either statutory cities or home rule charter cities. Statutory cities may select from three forms of organization, although one form is available only to statutory cities having populations above 1,000. Statutory cities are run according to rules laid down in Chapter 412 of the Minnesota Statutes.
Texas.
In Texas, only cities of more than 5,000 inhabitants may become, upon voter approval of a city charter, home-rule cities; the rest must be general-law cities. General-law cities have only those powers that state law expressly or implicitly authorizes. By contrast, home-rule cities may assume any power not prohibited by the state constitution or state laws. General-law municipalities are classified by population as type A, B, or C, with different options for their forms of government.
Washington.
In Washington (state), a code city is a city operating under the state's Optional Municipal Code rather than a charter.

Pedicar

The Pedicar was a pedal powered quadricycle velomobile developed in 1973 by the Environmental Trans-Sport Corporation in Windsor, Connecticut.
Background.
The Pedicar had a seat and an enclosed body with one door. The vehicle was propelled by a unique linear cable drive train with five forward and one reverse gear. The four wheels were standard bicycle wheels.
The vehicle was designed by Robert L. Bundschuh, a 38 year old ex-Gyrodyne aircraft engineer and his coworker, Lionel Martin, in 1972. They produced 20 models which sold for $500 in 1973. Flyers and TV commercials were produced.
Despite being marketed as a replacement for an automobile during the ongoing oil crisis and being fully enclosed from the weather, the Pedicar was not as commercially successful as the contemporary People Powered Vehicle and manufacturing issues prevented a contract with the U.S. Army from being completed.

John Muir (businessman)

Sir John Muir, 1st Baronet DL JP (1828–1903) was a Scottish businessman who served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1889 to 1892. He founded Finlay Muir &amp; Co, one of the world's largest 19th century companies.
Life.
He was born on 8 December 1828, the son of James Muir (b.1801) and his wife, Elizabeth Brown.
In 1849 Muir joined James Finlay and Co. cotton mill owners. In 1861 he became a junior partner and after buying out other partners became sole partner in 1883. Due to the American Civil War the company had to relocate the main source of cotton to India in 1871. There, with his cousin Hugh Brown Muir, they established the firm of Finlay Muir &amp; Co. In 1882, due to the Indian connection, they branched into tea plantations, and from their into rubber and jute. He became the major world stakeholder in tea growing and packing.
They also acquired plantations in Sri Lanka. By the end of the 19th century they controlled 270,000 acres, 77,000 of which were tea plantations.
The company's Indian headquarters were at Dalhousie Square in Calcutta, alongside the government buildings. The main production building was at Lyons Range next to the Calcutta Stock Exchange.
Muir was elected Lord Provost of Glasgow in 1889 and created a baronet by Queen Victoria in October 1892, his final year in office. He was succeeded as Lord Provost by Sir James Bell. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 4th Volunteer Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) in 1891.
In 1900 he lived at 6 Park Gardens, a grand three storey basement and attic terraced townhouse in Glasgow near Kelvingrove Park, and also had his country property, Deanston House in Perthshire. The Deanston property linked to Deanston Mill , one of the largest cotton mills in Scotland, employing 1000 people (now converted to a whisky distillery).
By his final years Finlay Muir &amp; Co had 90,000 employees worldwide, one of the largest companies ever. Approximately 70,000 were in the Indian subcontinent.
Muir died on 6 August 1903. He is buried in the remote rural burial ground of Kincardine-in Meneith, south-east of Deanston and west of Blair Drummond. The grave lies in a private enclosure accessed from a field to the north. The enclosure attaches to the north-west corner of the burial ground.
Finlay Muir had tea-trading premises in Glasgow until 2007.
Family.
Muir married Margaret Morrison Kay (d.1929). They had ten children, the first six being girls, then four sons.
The baronetcy passed to the eldest son, Sir Alexander Kay Muir (1868-1951).
Artistic Recognition.

Canelo Álvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin II

Canelo Álvarez vs. Gennady Golovkin II was a professional boxing rematch between Canelo Álvarez and Gennady Golovkin which took place at T-Mobile Arena in Paradise, Nevada on September 15, 2018. Alvarez won by majority decision.
The fight was originally scheduled to take place on May 5, 2018. However, in March 2018, two months prior to the fight, Álvarez failed a drug test for clenbuterol and was suspended by the Nevada Athletic Commission for six months. Álvarez formally withdrew from the fight, but renegotiated the rematch to occur in September after his suspension lapsed.
The bout was named "Fight of the Year 2018" by "The Ring" magazine.
Background.
The world's two top middleweights had collided the previous September and had fought a high quality and entertaining contest that ended with a controversial split draw after the full 12 rounds. However, with pundits and fans making cases for both fighters having won the bout, it was not so much the result of the draw that caused the controversy but rather the 118-110 scorecard in favour of Canelo by judge Adalaide Byrd, which was in stark contrast to the scorecards of 115-113 for Golovkin by Dave Moretti and the 114-114 even score by Don Trella.
Immediately after the controversial ending, talks began for a rematch between Álvarez and Golovkin. Álvarez stated he would next fight in May 2018, whereas Golovkin was open to fighting in December 2017. ESPN reported that Álvarez, who only had the rematch clause in his contract, must activate it within three weeks of their fight. On September 19, Golden Boy Promotions president Eric Gomez told ESPN that everyone on their side was interested in the rematch and they would hold discussions with Tom Loeffler in the next coming days. Ringtv reported that the negotiations would begin on September 22. On September 24, Gomez said the rematch would likely take place in the first week of May 2018, or if a deal could be worked, the fight could take place as early as March.
Despite ongoing negotiations for the rematch, at the 55th annual convention in Baku, Azerbaijan on October 2, the WBC officially ordered a rematch. Golden Boy president Eric Gomez told ESPN, "Regardless of if they did or didn't order the rematch, we are going to try to make it happen. We'll do whatever it takes to make it happen." On November 7, Eric Gomez indicated the negotiations were going well and Álvarez would make a decision in regards to the rematch in the coming weeks. It was believed that Golden Boy would wait until after David Lemieux and Billy Joe Saunders fought for the latter's WBO title on December 16, 2017 before making a decision. On November 15, Eddie Hearn, promoter of Daniel Jacobs stated that he approached Tom Loeffler regarding a possible rematch between Golovkin and Jacobs if the Álvarez-Golovkin rematch fails to take place.
On December 20, Eric Gomez announced that the negotiations were close to being finalized after Álvarez gave Golden Boy the go-ahead to write up the contracts. On January 29, 2018 HBO finally announced the rematch would take place on May 5 on the Cinco de Mayo weekend. Both fighters claimed that this time the judges would not be needed, with both men promising to knock the other out. The venue for the rematch was not confirmed until February 22, Madison Square Garden in New York had been in the running to host the event, but it was eventually decided that the stage would be the same as the first fight, the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. According to the WBC, unlike the first bout, Álvarez would fight for their title.
Cancellation.
The fate of the rematch was put in jeopardy on March 5, 2018, when Álvarez failed two random urine tests, collected on February 17 and 20, for the banned substance clenbuterol. The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) opened an investigation, and Álvarez was temporarily suspended on March 23, 2018—pending a hearing on April 10. In the hearing, Álvarez would face the possibility a suspension of up to one year. Loeffler stated that Golovkin intended to fight on May 5, regardless of his opponent. Former two-time light middleweight champion Demetrius Andrade made an offer to fight if Álvarez received a long-term suspension, as well as IBF #1 contender Sergiy Derevyanchenko.
The next day, NAC chief Bob Bennett filed a formal doping complaint against Álvarez, which delayed the disciplinary hearing to the commission's next monthly meeting on April 18. "ESPN.com" writer Dan Rafael felt that this delay made it more uncertain that the fight would go ahead, while T-Mobile Arena had already announced the previous day that it would offer full refunds on tickets. On April 3, 2018, Alvarez officially withdrew from the fight. Gomez explained that "given the current regulations in Nevada, we have been advised, and it is unfortunate, that Canelo won't be cleared to fight in May. We are hopeful this matter will be resolved and we are hoping Canelo will be cleared so we can reschedule the fight for August or September."
Rescheduling.
Álvarez was issued a six-month suspension by the Nevada Athletic Commission. As suspensions are retroactive from the date that the first failed test was collected (February 17, 2018), the suspension ended on August 17, 2018.
According to Golovkin on April 27, before he defeated Vanes Martirosyan, a fight with Álvarez in the fall was still a priority. During a conference call, he stated it was the 'biggest fight in the world and beneficial for all parties involved. Although Golovkin stated the rematch had a 10% chance of happening, Eric Gomez and Tom Loeffler agreed to meet and start negotiating after May 5. One of the main issues preventing the rematch to take place was the purse split. Álvarez wanted 65-35 in his favour, the same terms Golovkin agreed to initially, however Golovkin wanted a straight 50-50 split.
On June 6, Golovkin was stripped of his IBF world title due to not adhering to the IBF rules. The IBF granted Golovkin an exception to fight Martirosyan, although they would not sanction the fight, and ordered Golovkin's team to start negotiating a fight with mandatory challenger Sergiy Derevyanchenko by August 3, 2018. The IBF released a statement in detail. On June 7, Golovkin's team stated they would accept a 55-45 split in favour of Álvarez. The split in the initial rematch negotiations, Golovkin accepted a 65-35 split in favour of Álvarez. On June 12, Golden Boy gave Golovkin a 24-hour deadline to accept a 57½-42½ split in Álvarez's favor or they would explore other fights. At this time, Golden Boy were already in light negotiations with Eddie Hearn for a fight against Daniel Jacobs instead. At the same time, Loeffler was working closely with Frank Warren to match Saunders with Golovkin for the end of August.
On June 13, 2018, it was announced that Álvarez and Golovkin had finalized a deal to hold the rematch September 15, 2018 at T-Mobile Arena. Although it went past a negotiation deadline imposed by Golden Boy, it was reported that an unknown "tweak" employed by MGM Resorts International executives was a "Hail Mary" that had reinvigorated the negotiations. Golovkin revealed to ESPN he agreed to 45%. Álvarez started training for the bout on June 14 and stated his intention to apply for his boxing license on August 18. It was confirmed that both boxers would not physically come face to face with each other until fight week. A split-screen press conference took place on July 3.
On September 3, due to a majority vote of the panel, the vacant "Ring" magazine middleweight title would be contested for in the bout. Doug Fischer wrote, "We posed the question to the Ratings Panel, which, in a landslide, voted in favor of the magazine's 160-pound championship being up for grabs when the two stars clash at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas."
US distribution.
The fight was available for $84.99 in HD on HBO PPV on all major cable and satellite providers in the United States, on the FITE TV streaming service, and on Ring TV. This was the last PPV fight aired on HBO before HBO ended their boxing coverage in November and both fighters signed contracts with DAZN.
Weigh-in.
The weigh-in took place at the T-Mobile Arena in front of 9,000 fans. Golovkin took to the digital scale first and weighed 159.6 pounds. Álvarez weighed slightly lighter at 159.4 pounds. The traditional face-off was not without controversy, as this was the first time the two boxers had been face to face during the build up, with both camps trading insults. Golovkin was calm and collected, however, Álvarez went straight in to the face-off getting as close as he could before both camps intervened, cutting the face-off short. For the WBO junior middleweight title fight, Brandon Cook weighed 153.2 pounds and Jaime Munguia came in at the 154 pound limit. There was also controversy at the David Lemieux-Gary O'Sullivan face-off. Lemieux weighed 160 pounds and O'Sullivan weighed 159.2 pounds. During the face-off, O'Sullivan hung his arm out long in Lemieux's face, which Lemieux did not take kindly to. The two boxers were then separated. Román González weighed 114.8 pounds for his 10-round super flyweight bout with Moisés Fuentes, who himself had to strip and weighed 116 pounds.
Fight details.
In front of a sell out crowd of 21,965, the fight was again not without controversy as Álvarez defeated Golovkin via majority decision after 12 rounds. Álvarez was favoured by judges Dave Moretti and Steve Weisfeld, both scoring the bout 115-113, the third judge Glenn Fieldman scored it 114-114. The result was disputed by fans, pundits and media. Of the 18 media outlets scoring the bout, 10 ruled in favour of Golovkin, 7 scored it a draw, while 1 scored the bout for Álvarez. The scorecards showed how close the bout was, with the judges splitting eight rounds. After 9 rounds, all three judges had their scores reading 87-84 for Álvarez.
The fight was much different to the first bout in terms of action. Álvarez, who was described by Golovkin's team as a 'runner', altered his style and became more aggressive. The first round had Canelo and Golovkin starting more cautiously than in the first fight, attempting to figure out each style. Golovkin attempted to establish his jab as Canelo would throw mostly power punches. Canelo would win the next 2 rounds on each scorecard, landing the harder more explosive shots to the body and head while being aggressive, on the other hand, Golovkin still had not established his jab yet and was on the running side. The next 2 rounds had Golovkin be more active, particularly in round 4 throwing and landing more punches than the Mexican. In rounds 6,7 and 8 Canelo would take control of the fight again, landing harder punches while Golovkin had trouble with the more aggressive style of Canelo. The tide turned in rounds 9-11 as Canelo seemed to tire out, becoming less active while a more fresh Golovkin stunned Canelo multiple times. The 10th round had Canelo start the round strong but Golovkin landed the hardest punch of the fight, hurting Canelo, but the Mexican star showed good defence, dodging a load of power punches from Golovkin. In round 11, a stunned Canelo would lose his aggression, backing up to the ropes while Golovkin seemed strong, having his best round of the fight. The final round was up to grabs on the scorecards, each judge having Canelo up 105-104. Both men slugged it out, landing as many power punches as they could. The final decision had Canelo winning 115-113 on 2 cards as one judge had it 114-114. Álvarez made good use of his body attacks, landing 46 compared to Golovkin's 6 landed. CompuBox stats showed that Golovkin landed 234 of 879 punches thrown (27%) and Álvarez landed 202 of his 622 punches (33%). Golovkin outlanded Álvarez in eight of the rounds, while Álvarez landed more power punches in nine of the rounds.
Post-fight.
In the post-fight interviews, through a translator, Álvarez said, “I showed my victory with facts. He was the one who was backing up. I feel satisfied because I gave a great fight. It was a clear victory.” He continued, “That was a great fight. But in the end, it was a victory for Mexico. And again, it was an opportunity. And I want to shout out to my opponent, the best in the sport of boxing. I am a great fighter, and I showed it tonight. If the people want another round, I’ll do it again. But for right now, I will enjoy time with my family.”
Golovkin did not take part in the post fight interview and made his way backstage where he received stitches for a cut over his right eye. He later responded to the defeat, "I'm not going to say who won tonight, because the victory belongs to Canelo, according to the judges. I thought it was a very good fight for the fans and very exciting. I thought I fought better than he did."
Golovkin's trainer Abel Sanchez, who was very critical of Álvarez following the first fight said, “We had a great fight, the one we expected the first time around. I had it close going into the 12th round. We had good judges, who saw it from different angles. I can't complain about the decision, but it's close enough to warrant a third fight. Canelo fought a great fight. Congratulations.” Both fighters were open to a trilogy.
Reception.
The fight generated a live gate of $23,473,500 from 16,732 tickets sold. This was lower than the first bout, however the fourth largest-grossing gates in Nevada boxing history. The fight sold 1.1 million PPV buys, lower than the first bout, however due to being priced at $84.95, it generated more revenue at around $94 million. In total, the fight grossed about in revenue.
Fight purses.
According to the Nevada State Athletic Commission, Alvarez would earn an official purse of $5 million and Golovkin was to make a $4 million purse. It was reported with profits of the PPV, Alvarez would potentially earn around $40 million and Golovkin could earn $30 million.

The Sciberras Peninsula is a strip of land in the South Eastern Region of Malta, between the Grand Harbour in the south and Marsamxett Harbour in the north. It is called a peninsula, despite the absence of an isthmus, and at the end of this feature stands the Mount Sciberras, which gave its name to the peninsula. During the Arab occupation the peninsula was called "Mu'awiya", which has been taken up in Maltese as "Xagħriet Mewwija" (uncultivated and undulating heaths).
The capital of Valletta is located on the Sciberras Peninsula, as is the suburb Floriana.
The name comes from the old Maltese family name Sciberras or "Xiberras", who would have owned the land.

National Christian Council of China

The National Christian Council of China (NCC) was a Protestant organization in China. Its members were both Chinese Protestant churches and foreign missionary societies and its purpose was to promote cooperation among these churches and societies. The NCC was formed in 1922 in the aftermath of the Edinburgh Missionary Conference.
In its formative years, the NCC became involved in the endeavors of Chinese nationalists. It sided with protesters in the May Thirtieth Incident and went as far as calling for the re-evaluation of "unequal treaties" China had with foreign powers. This angered foreign missionaries working in China. The NCC took an increasingly liberal theological stance, leading some foreign missionary organizations like the China Inland Mission and the Christian and Missionary Alliance to resign from its ranks.
During Nationalist China, the council undertook many projects to improve literacy, education of women, living conditions in the countryside, and disaster management, although the Great Depression hampered them. The Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II further damaged the NCC's efforts, which were reduced to mostly helping war orphans while the leadership of the organization was at large.
After the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, the NCC came under government pressure. It was sidelined from talks with the new rulers, which were instead handled by pro-Communist Party of China (CPC) Protestants. The NCC convened its first national meeting after the war in October 1950, only to approve a pro-communist "Christian Manifesto" and support the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM). Neither had been on its agenda before the meeting, but the NCC was unable to resist the pressure. The NCC ceased to exist and Chinese Protestantism would continue to operate under the government-controlled TSPM, but without foreign missionaries who had to leave China.
Organization.
The National Christian Council of China (NCC) was not a church in itself. It was a liaison and coordination organization among Chinese Protestants of varying denominations and between Chinese churches and foreign missionaries. Exchange of information and ecumenism were key in its activities. The NCC had delegates from both missions and churches and acted as an advisory body to Protestants in China. Its task was to facilitate cooperation among churches and missions of varying Protestant backgrounds. The organization, however, did not have legislative or mandatory authority over its members. Additionally, from its inception, the NCC was to "study the development of the Church in self-support, self-government, and self-propagation". These are known as the Three-self principles. The NCC was based in 169 Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai. It was a member in the International Missionary Council.
The NCC had both Chinese and Westerners as members. Founding members included the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui. Its largest and most powerful Chinese member church was the Church of Christ in China.
The NCC had many sub-committees and published large numbers of Christian materials, including the "China for Christ Bulletin" in Chinese and "The NCC Bulletin" in English, its official organ. In 1923 it set up the Society for the Advancement of Christian Literature that was ran by Chinese Christians and published in Chinese. The NCC campaigned for literacy, and against opium use. The NCC also had programs to better the living conditions in the countryside, and ran charities, but its efforts were hampered by the Great Depression.
History.
In 1913, in the aftermath of the 1910 Edinburgh Missionary Conference, the China Continuation Committee was founded. To finalize the task of the Continuation Committee a National Christian Conference was held in Shanghai in 1922. This meeting brought together more than a thousand delegates. More than half of them were Chinese Protestants, who were struggling for unity amidst theological differences between liberals and conservatives. Despite this backdrop, the Conference almost unanimously decided to form the National Christian Council. The Continuation Committee was merged into the NCC and ceased to exist as an independent body, as did other organizations that had a similar fate, including China for Christ. Cheng Jingyi, who had chaired the conference, became the general secretary of NCC and remained in that position until 1933, while David Z. T. Yui was made the chairman of the organization from its inception until 1928. The first annual meeting of NCC was in 1923. Roman Catholics in China were not members of the NCC and had instead founded their Apostolic Delegation of China, also in 1922. Later, the model of the NCC was replicated in other countries as well, Including India, Japan, Korea, and the Philippines.
During the early years of the NCC, its inaugural chairman David Z. T. Yui sought to balance pressure from both nationalist and anti-nationalist groups, both inside and outside the Church, although he himself favored a synthesis of nationalism and Christianity. A turning point in this regard was the May Thirtieth Incident in 1925. Yu seized the opportunity to bring nationalist issues to the forefront at the NCC. The NCC sided with the nationalist protesters and sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council as well as a statement to foreign missionaries. The NCC stated that Christianity and patriotism are not mutually exclusive, indeed that social conscience of Christians could no longer be based on total disinterest in politics. The NCC also questioned the role of foreign missions in Chinese Christianity. The viewpoint of NCC angered Western powers, including missionaries. In 1926 the NCC passed numerous resolutions calling for revision of the "unequal treaties" between China and Western powers.
By 1926, encouraged by anti-Western sentiments, the proportion of Chinese in the Council had risen to 75% and they held the most important offices. Although most Protestant missionary societies working in China were represented in the NCC, it had liberal theological leanings that did not suit everybody. Conservative mission societies, such as, notably, the Southern Baptists, never joined the NCC. Some that had joined chose to resign later on. In 1926 the China Inland Mission, which had been a member of the NCC from the beginning, resigned from the organization because the it had, in their view, become too liberal. The Christian and Missionary Alliance also resigned the same year, citing the same reasons. Some conservatives founded the League of Christian Churches in 1929, as an alternative to the NCC.
Even during the years of Nationalist China (1912–1949), the NCC suffered from lack of resources and "had no control over the larger economic, political, and security environment", a deficiency that it could not remedy, despite its active members. Some projects that were supported by the nationalist government, such as building clinics and schools, were more successful. The NCC worked on education and health for many years during the Nationalist era. Its efforts to educate women particularly proved effective during wartime years. During that time, the NCC also took part in governmental relief efforts in the midst of many natural disasters that occurred in China in the early 1930s. By 1932, 70% of Protestants in China were represented by the NCC.
During the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, the NCC was forced to temporarily relocate its headquarters from Shanghai to Chongqing. The NCC's activities dwindled, with the exception of continued relief work, especially among refugee children. During the war, the NCC did have radio broadcast operations, in particular introducing to the audience each of its constituent churches. The NCC broadcast from Shanghai on the American station XMHA. The NCC's rhetoric, however, was less controversial than before the war. The broadcasts were of cautious tone, and avoided mentioning the Japanese by name, probably to protect missionaries who were in Japanese-occupied territories.
The NCC's last meeting before the war had been in 1937. Much of the personnel of NCC was unable to work and it took many months after the surrender of Japan in August 1945 to have them back to the formerly Japanese-occupied areas. Eventually, a meeting was convened in December 1946 and S. C. Leung emerged as the new chairman. In the midst of the transition period, the NCC spoke against corruption and social injustice, but considering the handover of all political affairs to the Communist Party of China (CPC), this was "too little too late". Chinese Protestant churches were unable to attain a level of independence from foreign missionaries under the NCC, which would bring their loyalties under question. Part of the problem was leadership. In late 1930s, Wu Yi-Fang had become chairperson, Ronald Rees secretary, Earl H. Cressy secretary of the commission on Christian education, and Edward H. Hume was secretary of the commission on Christian medical work. Edwin Carlyle Lobenstine was honorary secretary, and T. T. Lew was head of the National Committee for Christian Religious Education in China. Chen Wen-Yuan became the general secretary in 1936 and, later, honorary general secretary. Historian Daniel Bays writes: "To me, it seems likely that the NCC sorely missed the leadership of Cheng Jingyi and Yu Rizhang ". Both had died in the 1930s.
The Christian Manifesto.
When the first Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) convened in September 1949, the NCC was not invited because of its ties with Western missionaries. Instead, five progressive Christians with pro-Communist Party tendencies represented Chinese Protestants there: Y. T. Wu, T. C. Chao, Deng Yuzhi, Liu Liangmo, and Zhang Xueyan. The "Common Program" adopted by the CPPCC, the "de facto" interim constitution of the People's Republic of China, guaranteed freedom of religion. In November the Protestant delegates to the CPPCC sent out teams to Northern, Northwest, East, South, and Central China to see how the freedom of religion provision was being met in practice and to explain the United Front policy. For these teams, members chosen by the NCC were included. This marked the first time that the NCC, and indeed Chinese Christians, became involved in the united front controlled by the CPC. Upon their return, they planned to write a report about the situation and present it to the Chinese government. Wu also briefed the NCC, informing them about the imminent founding of the Religious Affairs Division (RAD, later renamed State Administration for Religious Affairs). 
Parallel with these developments the NCC published three open letters to Christians in China, two in 1948 before the PRC was established and one on December 10, 1949. That letter reviewed Christianity’s contributions to Chinese society and called on Christians to uphold social righteousness, support cooperative movements, and participate in reconstruction efforts. NCC leaders decided, in a January 26 meeting, to convene a national congress on August 19-27 to consider how to respond to developments including those involving the CPPCC and the RAD. One proposal, in reaction to the founding of RAD was to consolidate the NCC's powers to form a Christian organization matching RAD. There were concerns that the NCC would turn into a battleground of factions that wanted it either to stay independent or be subjected to the government of China. By late summer of 1950, "The Christian Manifesto" had become part of a campaign to establish the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) to replace the NCC, the TSPM being a more introvert organization.
Proponents of "The Christian Manifesto," in order to further its prospects of success, pushed to postpone the meeting , which eventually was held October 17-25, 1950. The preparatory committee of the meeting tried to fend off attempts to have the manifesto endorsed at the meeting, and even planned writing a counter-manifesto. Their efforts failed, and even though the TSPM was not even on the agenda of the meeting, the committee ended up unanimously supporting the manifesto and the TSPM, effectively ceding leadership to that organization. It was the first meeting in history where all Chinese Protestants were represented, and so its signing of the manifesto was of special importance. From that point on the road was open for both the inception of the TSPM and the acceptance of the manifesto by Protestants. For some, it was this moment rather than the initial publication that marked the manifesto's transforming of Chinese Christianity.
During the course of the early 1950s, the NCC became inoperative as the TSPM took over key positions in Chinese Protestant leadership. Foreign missionaries were surprised by the success of "The Christian Manifesto" and its subsequent impact on the missionary field. They were surprised by the ability of a relatively small number of activists to bypass the NCC, which at the time had massive resources and manpower behind it. The NCC was, after all, the highest Protestant authority in the country. Those most influential in promoting the Manifesto had been Protestants who were not affiliated with mainline churches, but with backgrounds in the YMCA and YWCA and whose role the missionaries consequentially failed to grasp. The NCC's relations with Westerners began to be called into question. In April 1951, the RAD initiated the Denunciation Movement which lasted until 1953. During it, the NCC was outright condemned. Foreign missionaries were no longer tolerated either and they had to leave China. Those who had not left by the time the Denunciation Movement was in full swing were caught in it. Because contacts and funding from foreign missionary boards was cut, the NCC had by the end of 1951 become "for all intents and purposes self-administering, self-supporting and self-propagating" – the Three-self principles of the TSPM.
The history of the NCC has been interpreted in various ways: as either an example of genuine Chinese ecumenism, as a precursor to the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM), or as a tool of Western missionary societies. According to Bays:

Kevin Siers

Kevin Siers (pronounced Sires) is an American editorial cartoonist for "The Charlotte Observer" and is syndicated by King Features. He was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning.
Biography.
Siers was born in Minnesota around 1954. His father was a mechanic who worked in ore mines. Before he could spell, Siers would draw cartoons, then add speech balloons to the drawings in which he would scribble gibberish. In elementary school, a fifth-grade teacher recognized his talent for drawing and encouraged him to create a comic book. Teachers at his high school continued to encourage his development. Initially, his drawings were copied from the style of popular comic strips, including most importantly the daily strips "Dick Tracy", "Lil' Abner" and "Pogo", and then later from the style of Marvel Comics. He was working as an iron ore miner in Minnesota when he began to draw editorial cartoons during a layoff.
Using money from his mining job, he attended the University of Minnesota as a biology major on a part-time basis, and joined the staff of campus newspaper "Minnesota Daily" as editorial cartoonist. While there, he became acquainted with Steve Sack (who won a Pulitzer for Editorial Cartooning the year before Siers), who became Siers' mentor. In 1987 he began drawing for "The Charlotte Observer" as an editorial cartoonist. He was further mentored there by Doug Marlette, the primary editorial cartoonist at the "Observer" at the time.
He was awarded the 2014 Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning for "his thought-provoking cartoons drawn with a sharp wit and bold artistic style." Siers was the third cartoonist from "The Observer" to win the Pulitzer, for "thought-provoking cartoons drawn with a sharp wit and bold artistic style."
Work.
Siers is known for making fun of politics without regard to affiliation. He divides his workday into three parts; the first part of his day is spent researching and assembling ideas, in the second phase he doodles the ideas and determines which combinations have the most potential, and he finalizes his daily cartoon by mid-day. He does not use a computer to create his cartoons, but instead draws in the traditional manner using fine-point pens and a watercolor brush. He does use Photoshop to add color after he has scanned his cartoon to digital format.
Though Siers describes himself as "very liberal", the "Washington Post" said in 2014 about half his cartoons attacked Barack Obama and half lampooned conservatives. He is the only local cartoonist in the Carolinas producing daily cartoons.

Kurunegala railway station

Kurunegala Railway Station (, ) is a major station, situated in the Kurunegala District, North Western Province, Sri Lanka. It is the 5th railway station on the Northern Line and 39th overall from the Colombo Fort Railway Station, at an elevation of above sea level. The station is located away from Kurunegala's town centre.
The station serves as a terminus for several trains, with all trains running on the Northern Line, Trincomalee Line, and Batticaloa Line, stopping at the station, however a number of Intercity express trains do not stop at the station. The station has a one platform with several passing loops or sidings and a crossing loop to facilitate the switching of terminating trains.
History.
The "Jaffna Railway Commission" report published in 1891 recommended the construction of a new railway line (now known as the northern line) from Polgahawela to Kurunegala and a survey of a line to Jaffna. The line would join the "Main Line" at Polgahawela Junction, allowing trains to run to the capital, Colombo. Approval to construct the line was granted in 1892 and the new line to Kurunegala officially opened on 14 February 1894 by Governor Sir Arthur Elibank Havelock. Construction of the rest of Northern Line continued, and on 1 August 1905, the first train from Colombo arrived at Jaffna Railway Station.

Jan Kanty Maszkowski

Jan Kanty Ignacy Maszkowski (1794 – 1865) was a Polish painter; known for portraits, history and genre paintings.
Life and work.
He displayed artistic skills from an early age. A local landowner named Jozef Levitzky took note and helped him enroll in the School of Drawing at the University of Lviv, where he studied from 1813 to 1818, under the pastellist, Józef Buisset (1776-1832). He then spent three years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna. His primary instructors there were Heinrich Füger and Johann Baptist von Lampi.
This was followed by studies in Rome, at the Accademia di San Luca, While there, he also visited Naples, Florence and Venice. In 1824 his patron, Levitzky, demanded that he return home, which he did, after a brief stay in Vienna. Once there, he focused on painting portraits and genre scenes in Volhynia and Podolia, and had his own workshop in Dubno.
From 1834 to 1843, he taught drawing at his alma mater, the University. When they closed the drawing school, he established his own school of painting at his workshop in Lviv. His pupils included Artur Grottger, Juliusz Kossak, Feliks Jan Szczęsny Morawski, Aleksander Raczyński, Henryk Rodakowski, Stanisław Tarnowski, Franciszek Tepa, and his son .
He died at his home in Barszczowice, a few days after his seventy-first birthday.
Family.

The range runs towards Sutlej (Govind Sagar Lake), its north side submerging gradually into Beas Valley, but on the south it has an abrupt fall of 200 and 300 feet and between the main range and the plains. This area, some 24 km in length and 21 km in width, is thickly forested. At a short distance south to Amb, the Solah Singhi Dhar range recedes eastward ceasing to form the boundary of Una district and the plains at this point form a kind of bay in the hills. From Bangana in Una it enters into Hamirpur district.

From 1991 to 1993, 1993 to 1994, 1997, and from 2001 to 2002 she was leader of the Green group in the state parliament. In 1993 she was the lead candidate in the state elections, in which the Hamburg Greens won 13.5% and 19 seats (up from 9). In 1997 Sager was again the lead candidate of the GAL, which was able to improve its result to 13.9% - the best ever state election result in the Greens' history, and a result that the Hamburg Greens were only able to improve in 2020. She subsequently led the negotiations on a coalition government with the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

From 2009 until 2013, she served on the Committee on Education, Research and Technology Assessment. In addition to her committee assignments, she was a member of the Parliamentary Friendship Group for Relations with the Baltic States.
Life after politics.
In 2016, Sager was appointed by Chancellor Angela Merkel to a three-member panel to oversee the implementation of a new law designed to avoid potential conflicts of interest, requiring senior German officials from the chancellor to deputy ministers to observe a cooling-off period if they want to quit the government for a job in business.

Bo LeMastus

James "Bo" LeMastus (born January 8, 1963) is an American businessman, professional racing driver, and former team owner. He races in the Stadium Super Trucks and formerly competed in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and ARCA Racing Series. He was also the co-owner of DGR-Crosley until 2021.
LeMastus is the CEO of Crosley Brands.
Business career.
LeMastus began as an intern at Modern Marketing Concepts in 1983, while studying for a business degree at Western Kentucky University. LeMastus later became CEO of the company. In 1994, the company acquired the Crosley name from the former company operated by Powel Crosley Jr..
In October 1998, LeMastus and a group of investors purchased the defunct Charlestown Motor Speedway stock car track in Indiana, converting it into the Podium One Motoplex motocross track. In 2018, LeMastus purchased Salem Speedway and the adjacent Salem Municipal Airport in Indiana, partnering with fellow ARCA drivers Bill and Will Kimmel in the venture.
Racing career.
Early career.
LeMastus initially competed in the AMA Motocross Championship from 1987 to 1999. He later competed in Sports Car Club of America-sanctioned road course racing.
Stock car racing.
In 2013, LeMastus purchased the equipment of Mark Gibson Racing and made his stock car debut at Daytona International Speedway in the ARCA Racing Series. He ran his first full season in the series in 2015, finishing sixth in points.
In 2018, LeMastus made his debut in the season-opener at Daytona. He was involved in a pile-up, and ended up finishing 30th after starting 16th. LeMastus continued to own DGR-Crosley with David Gilliland until 2021, though he remained involved in the team in a marketing role.
Off-road racing.
In 2021, LeMastus joined the Stadium Super Trucks weekend at the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg. His series debut ended with his truck flipping and sliding into the wall, which resulted in a red flag that cut nearly half the race distance due to time constraints. At the first Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course weekend in June, he was involved in a fight with Bill Hynes in response to LeMastus' aggressive driving style towards Max Gordon, resulting in LeMastus throwing his steering wheel at Hynes before Hynes threw LeMastus' helmet to the ground twice. LeMastus increased his SST involvement for August's Music City Grand Prix as Crosley provided naming rights for the series, dubbing it the Crosley Stadium Super Trucks, and sponsored him and four other drivers (Jacob Abel, Arie Luyendyk Jr., Ricky Johnson, Jeff Ward).

Fresh Start (comics)

Fresh Start is a 2018 relaunch of comic book publications by Marvel Comics, following Marvel Legacy.
Changes to the Marvel Universe.
The relaunch saw the return of Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Logan, Odinson and Bruce Banner to their classic identities of Iron Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Thor and Hulk respectively. All those characters had been replaced by legacy heroes in recent times. Stark ended up in a coma in "Civil War II", and his armor was donned by the reborn-villain Doctor Doom in "Infamous Iron Man" and by fifteen year old genius Riri Williams, who took on the codename Ironheart, in "Invincible Iron Man". Sam Wilson, a longtime ally of Captain America as Falcon, had taken the mantle in "All-New Captain America". Laura Kinney, the female clone of Logan who is also viewed as Logan's daughter, became the Wolverine in "All-New Wolverine". Jane Foster, a secondary character of the "Thor" comics, became a female Thor in "Thor" vol. 4. Bruce Banner died in "Civil War II", with Amadeus Cho becoming the new Incredible Hulk.
The relaunch also saw the return of Marvel's first family, the Fantastic Four, which had broken up following the conclusion of the 2015 "Secret Wars" storyline.
The Fresh Start initiative also includes a new incarnation of the West Coast Avengers, consisting of Hawkeye, Kate Bishop, Gwenpool, America Chavez, Quentin Quire, and Kate's boyfriend Johnny.
The teaser poster featured Jessica Jones and Miles Morales, characters created by Brian Michael Bendis. Bendis had recently moved to DC Comics; the poster confirmed that Marvel would keep publishing them.
On April 18, 2018, a sampler collection – "Marvel Universe Magazine" – was published, similar to "Marvel Legacy" #1 from the previous year. It included previews from several forthcoming new #1 issues.
The relaunch marked Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson resuming their relationship for the first time since their marriage was retconned out of existence in the "" storyline.
Many writers have been assigned with new titles; "The Amazing Spider-Man"s Dan Slott, "Deadpools Gerry Duggan and "The Avengers Mark Waid and others left their title due to the Fresh Start relaunch.
The "X-Men" line was relaunched with six new titles as part of the Dawn of X relaunch in 2019. The time-displaced original X-Men who were brought into the present day during Bendis' run on the 2012 "All-New X-Men" series before starring in their own "X-Men Blue" title, were returned to the past during the "Extermination" miniseries.
Criticism.
David Barnett from "The Guardian" pointed out that most of the characters involved have appeared in recent films or TV series, or are about to do so, and criticized that effort to emulate the feel of those productions instead of taking full advantage of the capabilities of the comic book medium to produce fantasy and sci-fi without the constraints of special effects budgets. He also considered that Marvel may be stepping back from its attempts to make comics featuring diverse female, black, Asian and LGBT characters, trying instead to appeal to its most conservative readership. Graeme McMillan from "The Hollywood Reporter" pointed out that Marvel has been announcing wide relaunches annually since 2012, but have provided limited changes.
Titles.
Digital originals.
Digital comics, first released as miniseries on Marvel Unlimited, and then collected as printed trade paperbacks.
Infinity Comics.
Infinity Comics are weekly stories told in visionary vertical format exclusively released on Marvel Unlimited.

The Vertical Film Festival (VFF) is a film festival held in Katoomba, New South Wales, Australia. Established in 2014, the Festival was conceived to encourage exploration of vertical film and video. This nascent format is variously referred to as tall-screen, portrait format, 9:16 aspect ratio or simply vertical video for short. The VFF was the first worldwide competition to be held for vertical videos and has since become a biennial event with public screenings in suitably vertical venues.
The Festival has been widely cited for its early engagement with the vertical format by Harvard University's Nieman Journalism Lab, in textbooks, in patents for new technologies, in academic papers, by the ProVideo Coalition, and in media sources ranging from Norway's public broadcaster NRK to Wired Magazine, ZDnet, the Huffington Post, Editions Financial, the Chicago Tribune, Guachazh in Brazil to L'Obs in France.
The Festival accepts submissions of moving image works created on film, video, computer or mobile devices providing that the frame is taller than it is wide, and the video is of at least high definition resolution.
Its stated aims include giving amateur and professional filmmakers alike encouragement to explore the aesthetic possibilities of the oft-maligned vertical format in its formative years as commercialisation of the format proceeds apace. As such it screens a broad mix of live action fiction, animation, video art and documentary works. The Festival's website also offers a 'tips &amp; tricks' guide to would-be vertical filmmakers dealing with various practical problems posed by having to work against apparatus and editing software often only designed for shooting horizontally.
History.
Conceived in early 2014 the Festival held its first edition in Katoomba, in Australia's Blue Mountains, on 17 October 2014. It was initially run under the auspices of the Australian Climbing Festival (ACF). Its co-founding directors are brother-sister team Adam Sebire and Natasha Sebire who initially conceived it as an interesting solution to an inherent problem faced by the ACF's film screening event: its principally vertical subject matter felt compositionally squashed by the standard film frame, which had replaced the 'squarer' in the early 2010s. No restrictions were placed on subject matter other than a maximum duration of 3 minutes, and indeed first prize went to an animation film. Entry to the Festival is free, with film submissions previewed for selection via Vimeo. The VFF is run as a not-for profit organisation; nobody is paid except the technicians, venues and the filmmakers who win prizes; the directors run it in their spare time.
The first Vertical Film Festival screened to a capacity audience at St. Hilda's Church, Katoomba in 2014 on a 4 metre high screen suspended above the transept, with the videos rear-projected in HD from behind the altar. The programme followed a formula the Festival has retained in future editions: showing finalist films from a worldwide competition call-out; intermission; a second half of curated tallscreen films from around the world; and finally the presentation of prizes. Finalists are shown online when the filmmakers so agree.
In 2016 the 2nd edition of the Festival moved quite literally across the road to another high-roofed venue, the independent Charrington Brewery, to be projected amidst the beer hops. On this occasion, prizes were chosen by popular audience vote.
In 2018 the Festival presented its 3rd edition on 8 December, also in Katoomba, Australia. The Festival announced that it would not run a 4th edition as scheduled for 2020 due to the logistical and economic challenges facing live screening presenters during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Moscow Circus (band)

Moscow Circus is a post-punk band formed in Long Eaton, Derbyshire in December 1987. The band currently comprises songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist, and vocalist, Jonathan Beckett, Tom Parratt on drums and backing vocals, Pete Temperton on bass Mark Paulson on guitar, and bassist Andrew Mainman who covers for Temperton when he is unavailable. After over 25 years since the band formed, they released their debut album "Resounding" in May 2016 on Echolocation Records.
History.
Early years (1987–1989).
Prior to the formation of Moscow Circus, in 1986, Tom Parratt and Jonathan Beckett formed a cover band called Out of Order. Following the disbandment in 1987, Parratt and Beckett created a band called Great Big Word. This was the first band where the two of them played original songs together. The band produced one album together entitled "Great Big Word!" before splitting up in late 1987. During Beckett's time in Great Big Word, he acquired his first guitar which was a Shergold Activator, after the bassist Rod Tippett pointed it out to him whilst they were shopping.
In December 1987, Moscow Circus (originally called Critical Hippo) was formed by Beckett, Parratt, and Pete Temperton, who, prior to forming the band, had never played bass before, but had some musical background with woodwind and brass instruments; in order to play, the band borrowed a Westone Thunder 1A bass guitar from a friend. Later, in 1988, Temperton purchased his own bass, which was a Marlin Sidewinder.
At first the band rehearsed at home but after frequent complaints from their neighbours; they moved to the local community centre which they could rent for £5.00. But they prioritized buying records from Selectadisc - a music store in Nottingham, and going to the pub over this practice. Three weeks after forming the band, the band performed their debut gig at The Garage in Nottingham in January 1988, supporting The Legendary Dolphins.
The band then changed their name to Moscow Circus, then to Stigmata, and, in May 1988, the trio moved into a shared house in Dunkirk, Nottingham, and did several more gigs around the city before disbanding in 1989.
Bloodsugar (1990–1991).
The band reformed as Bloodsugar in August 1990, it was at this time that Martin Haddelsey was added to the trio. The band recorded demos of various songs on Pete Temperton's 4-track tape recorder; once a week, the band would come together to record the parts - with the drums being recorded at their place of rehearsal, and the guitars, vocals, and keyboards being recorded at Tom Parratt's house. The group continued to perform around various Nottingham venues before splitting up again in 1991.
After the split, Jonathan Beckett penned the song 'Snapshot', and him and Temperton demoed it, this was the youngest song that featured on their later album: "Resounding". Whilst Beckett would work with both Temperton and Parratt on various other musical endeavors, the original lineup wouldn't come back together again for over fifteen years.
"A Parallel Derbyshire" (2007-2011).
In late 2007, Jonathan Beckett had the idea of bringing the band back together in celebration of the fortieth birthdays of two of the band members, himself and Pete Temperton; as Temperton hadn't played bass since the split, Beckett was unsure at first if he would agree. The band played their first gig since 1991, under the name Moscow Circus in 2008 at The Loft. Later on that year, the band performed at Nottingham's punk and alternative music venue: Junktion 7 on Saturday 22 November, which was their birthday celebration gig. Whilst the band only intended to come back as a birthday celebration: the gigs were well received and they realized how much they missed being together.
Prior to the reunion of the band, Beckett went to university to complete his music degree, during this time he took the 4-track demos from the Bloodsugar years and made new mixes of them, then, once the band had came back together, a track list was decided and artwork produced. This album was called "A Parallel Derbyshire", and it was never officially released; instead it was distributed to the friends and members of the band in 2008. Some of the recordings from this album were later made available on Myspace.
Shortly after reforming, the band received their first ever US radio play when 'Princess Rainbow' was featured on a radio show called 'The 80s Underground' on Radio KSCU, Santa Clara, California.
"Resounding" (2012–2016).
Between 2012 and 2013, Moscow Circus began recording their debut album "Resounding" at Hypermonosonic Recordings, the name was suggested by Tom Parratt. All songs on "Resounding" were written between 1987 and 1991; some of the songs from the 2008 demo album "A Parallel Derbyshire" also made an appearance on the new release, such as 'Princess Rainbow', and 'Snapshot'. The band enlisted the help from Tiago Queiroz of Thee Eviltones as a producer as Beckett liked the guitar tones he produced on the Thee Eviltones record; Queiroz also featured on the album as an additional guitarist on two of the songs. The album was fully mixed and mastered by early 2014. Beckett had hoped that Moscow Circus would have the backing of a record label, but this didn't work out. The band decided to create their own label: Echolocation Records in 2015; the album was set to be released in the same year, but was postponed until 27 May 2016 due to the fact they scrapped the cover-art. The new cover-art was produced by Jim Donnelly.
From the album, the band decided to create music videos for two of the songs, these are: 'Princess Rainbow', which was created by Caroline Abbott in 2014, and 'Timebomb', made by Phil Hadley. The music video for 'Princess Rainbow' used footage from Nottingham Green Festival, where they played the song, and various others from their album on Sunday 1 September 2013.
When "Resounding" was released, it was met by praise from critics. The band celebrated the release at the Old Salutation Inn album launch show; before 'My Lifetime', Beckett announced that Mark Paulson had joined the band. Following the release of the album, Moscow Circus appeared on The Smelly Flowerpot on Cambridge 105 for an interview, and to perform some of the songs. At the end of the year, backing vocalist and keyboardist Martin Haddelsey, left the band.
Post-"Resounding" (2017–present).
During the production of "Resounding", three extra tracks were recorded at Hypermonosonic Recordings. These have been set to be released as a download.
The first of which, 'This Train', was officially released on 6 July 2018 on Echolocation Records, although it received its first radio play four days prior. The cover art was produced by Jim Donnelly. The release was covered by Mike Wright from Cambridge Music Reviews who stated that "Beckett [uses] various train metaphors as a platform for philosophical musings on mortality and destiny. The messages are wrapped in some surreal imagery."
'My Lifetime' then was released on 1 March 2019, the download also featured a 1990 demo version of the song.
Musical style and influences.
Moscow Circus' music has been described as post-punk, indie, and folk-rock. According to Kim Harten, Moscow Circus combine "indie rock and pop, psychedelia, vintage synth music, and the brooding atmospheres and emotional urgency of post-punk into a coherent whole."
The members share a lot of common ground regarding tastes in music; R.E.M. and Husker Du were strong influences on 'Ex Genius'. The band also gained influence from post-punk bands such as Joy Division, Echo And The Bunnymen, Wire and Talking Heads - 'Once in a Lifetime' was the first single Jonathan Beckett purchased; as well as sixties psychedelic music, and garage punk. In an article in PennyBlackMusic, a Scottish music magazine, published on 22 December 2016, Beckett describes some of his favorite albums, these include: "Talk Talk Talk" by the Psychedelic Furs, "Systems of Romance" by Ultravox, "Feline" by The Stranglers; and "Computer World" by Kraftwerk - which he received for Christmas in 1981.
Beckett's solo career.
In 2004 Jonathan Beckett released the song 'She's a Vampire', written in 1998, it was released as part of a home-produced five-track EP. Beckett's music attracted the attention of Paul Simpson of The Wild Swans who stated:"I'm a sucker for musical beauty, lyrical sadness and outsiderism, and they don't come more beautifully outsider than Jonathan Beckett. For me, stumbling upon Jonathan's music is a bit like chancing upon the ivy-covered remains of an architecturally significant stately home while out walking in the woods; a little decayed, ever so slightly scary perhaps, but beneath the ivy lie elegant mullioned windows, intricately carved stone bestiary and secret doors in the oak paneling."Later, In June 2010, Beckett released an E.P. which shared the name of the song 'She's a Vampire'; this also featured the song 'Between Two Worlds', which was originally released in 2003 on a home-produced album named "Start Point". "She's a Vampire" was released on the same record label that The Wild Swans were on: Occultation Recordings, as Simpson put Beckett in contact with Nick Halliwell - the owner, the E.P. was later re-released on Echolocation Records as a download. Featured on the E.P. as the bass player was Andrew Mainman, who would later become the bassist for Moscow Circus whenever Pete Temperton is unavailable. Beckett also notes in an interview for PennyBlackMusic that one of his musical heroes Will Sergeant, the guitarist of Echo and The Bunnymen, contacted him in 2010 to state that he loved 'She's a Vampire'.
In January 2012, he sang 'I Lost My Sense Of Humour At The Sacre Coeur' on the compilation album "No Sleep Til Torcross," released on Vollwert Records (a small Indie label based in Berlin).
In March 2013, Beckett performed two Robyn Hitchcock songs on Dave Hammond's radio show on Cambridge 105.

Thomas Schneider (rower)

Thomas Schneider (born 30 March 1932) is a West German rower who represented the United Team of Germany. Together with Gerhard Häge, he won the first European medal for the once dominant rowing nation after World War II.
Schneider was born in 1932 and rowed for Gießener RG 1877 in Giessen. Rowing trainer Ludwig Marquardt enticed him to team up with Häge from the Ruderverein "Neptun" in Konstanz. The scullers won a regatta in Hanover, a three-nation contest in Klagenfurt, and then the German national championships in Hanover. This qualified them for the 1954 European Rowing Championships, held shortly after in Amsterdam, where they won gold in the double sculls. This was the first medal for Germany after the war and was thus the reason for much celebration for the once dominant rowing nation. In December 1954, Häge and Schneider received the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Germany's highest sports award, from the nation's Chancellor Theodor Heuss.
At the 1955 German national championships in Berlin, Schneider and Häge were beaten by Manfred Rulffs and Klaus von Fersen. Schneider then teamed up with Kurt Hipper and competed at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne with the men's double sculls where they came fourth.

Royal Lancer

Royal Lancer (1919 – after 1937) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed little promise as a juvenile when he won one minor race from six attempts. In the following year he made steady improvement, winning three handicap races before recording a 33/1 upset victory in the St Leger. He followed up by taking the Irish St. Leger but never won again and was retired from racing in 1923. He made no impact as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Royal Lancer was a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks bred in County Kildare Ireland by the National Stud and leased during his racing career to Hugh Lowther, 5th Earl of Lonsdale. The leasing arrangement meant that one third of the horses earnings went to the Stud. He was a very late foal, being born towards the end of May and was undersized and unprepossessing as a yearling. The colt was sent into training with Alfred "Flash Alf" Sadler at the Freemason Lodge table in Newmarket, Suffolk.
His sire Spearmint won the Derby and the Grand Prix de Paris in 1906 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose other foals included Spion Kop, Zionist (Irish Derby), Johren and Plucky Liege. Royal Lancer was the first foal of his dam Royal Favour a great-granddaughter of the British broodmare St Cypria (foaled 1888) whose other descendants have included Bold Ruler, The Panther, Touching Wood and Speciosa.
The name "Royal Lancer" had previously been given to a top-class racehorse who won the Sussex Stakes in 1902.
Racing career.
1921: two-year-old season.
Royal Lancer showed moderate ability in his first season on the track. After failing to win or place in his first five starts he eventually recorded a victory in the £275 Leyester Nursery at Warwick Racecourse.
1922: three-year-old season.
On his first appearance as a three-year-old in the Newark Three-Year-Old Handicap over one mile at Nottingham Racecourse and won from twelve rivals under a weight of 118 pounds. He followed up by carrying 109 pounds to victory in the New Stands Handicap over ten furlongs at Pontefract and then finished second to Fred Power in the Dee Stakes at Chester. Royal Lancer first attracted serious attention on 20 May when he won the Royal Windsor Three-Year-Old Handicap over one and a half miles at Windsor Racecourse, performance which saw him being described as a "high-class" horse.
On 13 September Royal Lancer was stepped up sharply in class for the 147th St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse in which he was ridden by the seventeen-year-old apprentice jockey Robert "Bobby" Jones. He started a 33/1 outsider in a twenty-two runner field headed by the French challenger Ramus, winner of the Prix du Jockey Club. The complexion of the race was changed at the start when Ramus missed the break and was left a long way behind the other runners. Royal Lancer was always in contention, went to the front in the straight and won the race "easily" by two lengths from Lord Derby's Silurian, with a further two lengths back to Abe Bailey's Ceylonese in third. Lord Londale was pleased but surprised by the result, stating that the winner had been much inferior to his uplaced stablemate Diligence. Bobby Jones said "Royal Lancer could have gone to the front much sooner than he did had I cared to let him, and once I got there it was smooth going for me and I was confident of winning my first classic."
Eight days after his victory at Doncaster, Royal Lancer won the Irish St. Leger at the Curragh. On 26 October at Newmarket the colt started the 4/5 for the Jockey Club Cup but was beaten into second place by Bucks Hussar.
Royal Lancer earned £14,522 in 1922,making him the most financially successful racehorse in the season ahead of Golden Myth, Captain Cuttle and Pogrom.
1923: four-year-old season.
Royal Lancer remained in training as a four-year-old in 1923 but sustained a serious injury in spring and did not race again. He was retired from racing at the end of the year.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Royal Lancer as a "poor" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
At the end of his racing career, Royal Lancer was retired to become a breeding stallion at Lord Lonsdale's stud at Barleythorpe in Rutland. He had very little success as a breeding stallion and was exported to South Africa where his last foals were born in 1938.

Big Baller Brand International Tournament

The Big Baller Brand International Tournament was a round-robin basketball tournament hosted by Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas of the Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) that featured three teams from different European countries. It began on February 25 and ended on February 27, 2018, with a total of six games and three games per team. The competition took place at Prienai Arena in Prienai, Lithuania, with the games featuring Vytautas being streamed through Facebook.
Wilki Morskie Szczecin, who play in the Polish Basketball League (PLK), claimed the tournament title after winning all three games and defeating runners-up, the Latvian second-tier VEF Rīga Skola, 94–74 in the deciding game. Slovenian team Helios Suns Domžale and hosts Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas finished in third and fourth place respectively.
History.
Following the Big Baller Brand Challenge Games, a series of exhibition games hosted by Vytautas Prienai–Birštonas in January 2018 to feature new American signees LaMelo and LiAngeo Ball, it was announced that the team was planning to hold a similar competition at the end of February. At the time, Vytautas offered several top European youth clubs to participate, and in the following weeks, it was revealed that they had also invited Italian teams. In addition, Vytautas attempted to bring Lithuanian Basketball League (LKL) teams to the competition, but according to team general manager Adomas Kubilius, they turned down the invitations for financial reasons and due to the lack of defense in the exhibition games. On February 19, 2018, Vytautas officially announced the Big Baller Brand International Tournament. The tournament was played in a single round-robin format, with each team meeting all the other teams one time and final standings being determined by record.
The Big Baller Brand International Tournament was sponsored by Big Baller Brand, a sports apparel company owned by LaVar Ball, the father of Vytautas players LaMelo and LiAngelo Ball. LaVar Ball also assumed the head coaching position for Vytautas during the tournament. The games that featured Vytautas were streamed live on Facebook through the Ballislife.com page.

Vytautas led by as many as 29 points in the first quarter, but after the hosts substituted all five starters, VEF Skola quickly reduced their deficit.

FS Class E.420

FS class E.420 locomotive was a third rail electric locomotive built for the operation of the Milan - Gallarate - Varese railway in Italy.
History.
The locomotive was ordered for the operation of the Milan - Gallarate - Varese railway line, electrified in 1901 by the Rete Mediterranea (RM). It was registered by the RM as RM.01 and was used for both passenger and freight traffic. In addition, twenty railcars were ordered.
In 1905 the locomotive was taken over by the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS). In the late 1920s, the locomotive was transferred from the Varese line to the Naples subway, to be used for freight traffic from Naples Campi Flegrei station. With the electrification at 3000 V DC of the Neapolitan line in 1937, it was transferred to the Cumana railway, which had been electrified in 1927. Here, it was converted to the 1200 V DC overhead line system and fitted with a pantograph. It remained in service until 1963.
Technical details.
The locomotive was built by General Electric and was similar to machines already in operation in the United States and Europe. In particular, it was similar to the E1-E8 series supplied to the French Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans and exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1900) in Paris. The four traction motors totalled 440 kW, identical to that of the railcars delivered at the same time. At the maximum speed of 60 km/h, the locomotive could haul a train of eight four-wheel coaches. In appearance, the E.420 resembled the locomotives delivered to the Paris-Orléans railway, known as "salt boxes".

Five Easy Pieces (Milo Rau)

Five Easy Pieces (2016) is a theatre production that the Swiss theatre and film director Milo Rau made with children for the Ghent arts centre CAMPO and that is based on the Dutroux affair.
The Dutroux affair as a starting point.
As with other theatre productions by Milo Rau, testimonies and reconstructions of true facts form the basis of "Five Easy Pieces". In this case they relate to the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux, who kidnapped, raped and murdered with the help of some accomplices a series of children in the 90s in Belgium. Milo Rau says that he is always looking for the traumatic, tragic moments in the lives of both individuals and a country, because we are most affected and changed in those moments.
However, Milo Rau's intention was not to create an accurate representation of the Dutroux affair with "Five Easy Pieces", but a modern tragedy with Dutroux as the starting point. His intention was to make "a children's theatre performance that was risky, unprecedented and virtually impossible." With the life and the crimes of Marc Dutroux as a starting point he searches in "Five Easy Pieces" for the limits of "what children know, feel and do", and explores what is acceptable and unacceptable for the spectators.
Underlying themes.
The essence of "Five Easy Pieces" is not the horror of the Dutroux affair, but the big themes that lie behind this specific case. According to Milo Rau, these are "the decline of a country, the national paranoia, the mourning, and the anger that followed the crimes." It is not the killer and his psyche that interest him, but the history of Belgium and the collapse of Western colonial and industrial powers. In the Dutroux affair a number of important historical events concerning Belgium converge: from the loss of the Congo colony to the closure of the coal mines. In the theatre production Marc Dutroux functions as a kind of collective symbol for Belgium, as a black hole.
With "Five Easy Pieces" Milo Rau fictionalizes the Dutroux affair with the aim of telling something that exceeds the case. According to his own word, Marc Dutroux is a pretext for him to talk "about a government that does not function and about to what extent people have been disconnected from the political system." The Dutroux affair serves as an allegory about how we experience the world and think about it, and about how we deal with the emotional shock and pain caused by an extremely upsetting experience.
Metatheatre (Theatre about theatre).
Milo Rau's "Five Easy Pieces" is also a reflection on theatre. The title "Five Easy Pieces" refers to a series of exercises that Igor Stravinsky composed in 1917 in order to teach children how to play the piano, and that were also called "Five Easy Pieces". The theatre production of Milo Rau is made up of five monologues, each offering a different perspective on how children learn to act and how they learn to grow up. Milo Rau sees his performances as "Lehrstücke", in the Brechtian tradition: his actors learn to play.
Every scene of Milo Rau's "Five Easy Pieces" starts with the projection of a short film in which adults start the scene. The children then take up live, act the scene simultaneously on the theatre stage, and continue playing while the only adult actor - in the role of director - films and encourages them. In this way the children play the role of the old and sick father of Dutroux, a police agent who discovers the murdered children, one of his victims and the parents of one of his other victims. What Milo Rau was interested in was to show the audience that a director, just like Marc Dutroux, is always a manipulator to a certain extent and that there exists a power game between him and his actors (especially if they are children).
Artistic team.
Milo Rau is responsible for the concept, text and direction of "Five Easy Pieces". The actors on stage are Rachel Dedain, Aimone De Zordo, Fons Dumont, Arno John Keys, Maurice Leerman, Pepijn Loobuyck, Willem Loobuyck, Blanche Ghyssaert, Polly Persyn, Lucia Redondo, Peter Seynaeve, Pepijn Siddiki, Elle Liza Tayou, Winne Vanacker, Hendrik Van Doorn and Eva Luna Van Hijfte. However, they form two different casts of seven children and one adult. Peter Seynaeve also takes on the role of directing assistant and performance coach. The actors in the film material are Sara De Bosschere, Pieter-Jan De Wyngaert, Johan Leysen, Peter Seynaeve, Jan Steen, Ans Van den Eede, Hendrik Van Doorn and Annabelle Van Nieuwenhuyse. Stefan Bläske is the dramatic advisor.
"Five Easy Pieces" (Milo Rau, 2016) is a production of the Ghent arts centre CAMPO and the International Institute of Political Murder (IIPM), the theatre and film production company of Milo Rau. Co-producers are the Kunstenfestivaldesarts (Brussels), Münchner Kammerspiele, La Bâtie - Festival de Genève, Kaserne Basel, Gessnerallee Zürich, Singapore International Festival of Arts (SIFA), SICK! Festival (Manchester), Sophiensaele Berlin and Le phénix scene national Valenciennes pôle européen de création.
Performances.
"Five Easy Pieces" premiered on 14 May 2016 at the Kunstenfestivaldesarts in Brussels. An extensive tour in Belgium and abroad followed afterwards, from 2016 until 2018. In Belgium, the production was performed in Aalst, Brussels, Charleroi, Genk, Ghent, Mons, Namur, Ostend, Roeselare, Turnhout, Waregem and Zaventem. In the Netherlands performances took place in Amsterdam, 's-Hertogenbosch, Rotterdam and Utrecht. In addition, the production travelled around the world with an extensive series of performances in Argentina, Australia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Germany, France, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Brasil, U.S. and Japan.
Reception in press.
"Five Easy Pieces" received wide critical acclaim in the press. Based on a poll among about fifty critics, the German specialist journal Theater Heute proclaimed "Five easy pieces" as best production of the year.
Theatre critic Tuur Devens wrote in the Dutch theatre magazine Theaterkrant: "But let Dutroux play by children?! Children who play casual and innocent, you can not let them bring such horror? Milo Rau does it, and in his way in a splendid way: the subject matter of "Five Easy Pieces" is the Dutroux affair, but at the same time it is about playing, about manipulation and abuse of power in the world, outside and in theatre." In the Dutch newspaper NRC culture editor Herien Wensink wrote: "You could blame director Milo Rau - public impact is guaranteed - but the execution is subdued and integer, the result powerful and disruptive." Journalist Magali Degrande wrote in the Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: ""Five Easy Pieces" makes you shiver and smile, a nacre pickaxe that reveals hidden basements and rolls flat over them. Irresponsibly good theater."
Yet there were also some critical reactions, especially from Jean Lambrecks, the father of one of the victims of Dutroux. He was disappointed because Milo Rau's production is insufficiently a factual representation of the Dutroux affair.
Festival selections.
In 2017 "Five Easy Pieces" was selected for the Theater Festival in both the Netherlands and Flanders. Together with "Risjaar Drei" (Olympique Dramatique and Toneelhuis, 2017), it was the only production that was selected for both festivals, which present the most interesting performances of the past season. In its report the jury of the Flanders Theatre Festival wrote: "Its wry humour and its political-social commitment make 'Five Easy Pieces' one of the most captivating theatre experiences of the past season, which the jury voted for as one block". In 2017 the production was also selected for the German Theatertreffen festival, which shows the ten most notable productions of the past season. 
Furthermore, the play was presented at the Schauspiel Köln as part of the Impulse Festival in 2017 (30 June and 1 July). On both dates German and English subtitles were provided and a discussion with Milo Rau and the cast that was open to questions from the audience followed after a short break on the prior date. There it was also addressed that one scene that features a young, fully naked girl was not allowed to be performed as part of the festival. After some back and forth one had agreed to exchange the live scene with a video recording of it. In advance German newspapers already announced this play as one of the festival highlights whilst dropping Milo Rau's name. 
Awards.
In October 2016 Milo Rau received the Special Prize of the Jury 2016 for "Five Easy Pieces" from the Belgian "Prix de la Critique Théâtre et Danse". The jury report stated: "This is not a performance, but a flagellation. [...] This is all the brave, reckless genius of Milo Rau, who never curbs the candour of the young actors but slips in powerful metaphors."
Afterwards, a series of prizes followed outside of Belgium. At the Theatertreffen festival in Berlin in May 2017, Milo Rau was awarded the 3sat prize for the production. The jury praised the director for his trendsetting and artistic-innovative work. The jury report stated: "Rau does not make the monstrous bearable, but he makes it narrative, and asks fundamental questions about violence between minors and adults. In this way, 'Five Easy Pieces' celebrates what the Dutrouxs of this world want to destroy: childlike wisdom, childlike will and childlike pride." The German-speaking theatre magazine Theater Heute awarded the production with both the best production prize in 2017 and the prize for the best dramaturgy in 2017. At the MESS festival in Sarajevo in October 2017, "Five Easy Pieces" received four prizes: the Grand Prix – Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Performance, the Golden Laurel Wreath for Best Director, the Audience Award for Best Performance and the MESS Critics Award. A couple of months later, in December 2017, the production received the Premio Ubu 2017 for the best foreign show in Italy.

Hand of Death (1962 film)

Hand of Death (also known as Five Fingers of Death) is a low-budget 1962 American horror film directed by Gene Nelson, and written and produced by Eugene Ling. The film stars John Agar, Paula Raymond, Stephen Dunne and Roy Gordon. The narrative follows a scientist who develops a military nerve gas. After accidentally exposing himself to it, he not only turns into a grotesque monster, but anyone who touches him dies. The scientist goes on the run but is killed by police before a curative serum can be tried on him.
It was Nelson's directorial debut and the first film produced by Ling.
Plot.
Scientist Alex Marsh (Agar) has invented a powerful paralytic-hypnotic nerve gas for the military that he has been testing on sheep in the California desert. The local mailman (Jack Younger) blunders into the test site and is overcome but recovers without ill effect. A confidant Alex rushes to the Los Angeles home of his mentor, Dr. Frederick Ramsey (Gordon), to tell him about it. Alex's girlfriend Carol Wilson (Raymond) and his colleague Tom Holland (Dunne) are also there. Alex designed the gas as a way to eliminate casualties at war by placing those exposed to it in a trance-like state for a certain amount of time, at which time the exposed are compliant to any commands given to them. Although Carol feels the project is both dangerous and immoral, Alex continues his testing, vowing not to stop until he has found a way to eliminate the loss of life in war.
While working in the lab, Alex accidentally spills a liquefied version of the nerve gas and, in a hast to clean it up, accidentally gets some of it on his hands. The next day, Alex awakens to discover his extremities have darkened, and have become irritating and painful. When his assistant Carlos (John A. Alonzo) touches him, Carlos withers away and dies. Panicking, Alex sets the lab afire to cover Carlos's death and heads to Ramsey's. When Alex stops as a gas station, the attendant (Joe Besser) dies after touching him, causing Alex to flee in horror.
Arriving at Ramsey's house, Alex begs him to find an antidote, which Ramsey eventually agrees to do with the help of Tom. After the first attempted cure has no effect, a desperate Alex consumes the vial of serum Ramsey was working on. Instead of curing his condition like Alex had hoped, the serum mutates him further, bloating and darkening his body until he is unrecognizable. Horrified by his monstrous appearance, Alex accidentally kills Ramsey and flees. Attempting to cover his now deformed features with a trench coat and a fedora, Alex tries to hail a cab but the driver is unable to understand his muffled speech, and when the cabbie tries to get Alex out of the cab he is killed after touching him and Alex flees in the cab.
Alex later abandons the cab and stumbles toward Tom's house, where Carol is staying. Breaking into the house Alex attempts to speak to a terrified Carol, but can only scrawl a note in shaky handwriting that simply reads "TOM SERUM HELP."
The police soon arrive and Alex flees to the beach, where he is surrounded by the armed police. Although Carol pleas for Alex to surrender, the mutated scientist whose mind has become warped lunges towards them and is promptly gunned down.
Production.
Screenplay writer Harry Spalding said that 20th Century Fox initially refused the project but passed it on to Robert L. Lippert's Associated Productions, which had made low budget movies for them in the past. Ling was assigned to write the script for "Hand of Death" because Maury Dexter, a producer/director himself, said that Lippert "owed him a favor." According to Dexter, they could not find an experienced director for the film because the script was so bad. Nelson had acted in the past and was keen to direct, so Lippert gave him the job. Shooting took seven days.
Filming took place in Malibu and Santa Monica. Raymond said in an interview that "shortly after completing" "Hand of Death", she had a serious car crash which severed her nose and resulted in multiple plastic surgeries. At the time of interview, she said she had never seen the film.
The working titles of "Hand of Death" were "Five Fingers of Death" and "The Death Walker". The film was shot in black-and-white CinemaScope with a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1.
Theatrical posters for the film were headlined "He Experimented in HORROR!", "No One Dared Come Too Close" and "DOOM Was Always In His GRASP!"
Release.
"Hand of Death" was released in the US on May 1, 1962 on a double bill with "The Cabinet of Caligari". The latter film is described as "not so much a remake" of the famous 1920 German Expressionist film "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari", but as one "inspired" by it.
"Hand of Death" was granted an X certification by the British Board of Film Censors on 5 March 1962. The X-cert prevented it from legally being shown in theatres to audience members under age 16.
According to "BoxOffice" magazine's "Boxoffice Barometer," the film opened simultaneously in Denver; Detroit; Kansas City; New Haven CT; and Omaha NE. The "Barometer" shows how financially well new releases are performing during their first week, with a score of 100 indicating "normal" gross box office receipts. "Hand of Death" averaged an 85 with scores in the same order as the five cities listed above of 65, 70, 100, 90 and 100, By comparison, the most popular film of the same week, "The Music Man", had an average score of 273.
Critic Bryan Senn writes that "Hand of Death" was part of Fox's TV movie package during the 1960s and early 1970s, but "the company's distribution rights expired in the early 1980s, causing the feature to fall into legal limbo. Consequently, the movie languished unseen for over two decades," resurfacing sometime after the year 2000. As such, it was generally regarded as a lost film. Film historian Bill Warren, however, says that Agar brought a previously unknown VHS copy of the film to his birthday party "a year or so" before his death in 2002.
"Hand of Death" was shown on FXM on 6, 15, 16, 20 and 21 September 2020.
Home media.
The film was released for the first time on DVD by Willette Acquisition Corp. on March 17, 2015.
Reception.
"Hand of Death" received mostly negative reviews upon its release.
"BoxOffice" magazine, in a review in its issue of March 19, 1962, called it "program filler from the word go" and which will cause the more "discriminating" audience members to "squirm with disgust." As for acting, though, the anonymous reviewer says that Agar is "appropriately grim-faced" and "Miss Raymond is a proper feminine foil and the supporting actors are good." Warren notes that the film "begins reasonably well (...) but when the plot becomes clear, with Agar simply killing a bunch of people before he himself is shot, most audiences lost interest. They'd seen it before, and the early promise was betrayed." Similarly, Bruce Elder at AllMovie points out that by the time it was released, "this kind of movie was rapidly losing its traditional audience, as earlier examples from the genre (...) began showing up regularly on television." "TV Guide" was also critical of the film, giving it one out of four stars.
Legacy.
Agar's makeup has gotten some degree of attention over the years. In an interview, Agar said that his son, age 2 or 3 at the time, "came onto the set with his mother and heard his dad's voice coming out of this monster get-up - it scared him half to death! I had a tough time explaining it to him." Raymond recalled it as "grotesque" but "outstanding and frightening to look at." But while Warren comments that makeup artist Bob Mark used "some admirable imagination" in creating the Alex-monster, he also writes that "having [Alex] turn black was a terrible blunder" for the studio because it resulted in the monster looking like "the grossest possible caricature of a black man." Senn agrees, writing that "Though it's doubtful filmmakers intended to send a racial message, this seemingly insensitive device speaks volumes about the way many whites viewed African American men in the early 1960s."

Damnation (comics)

Damnation is a comic book limited series written by Donny Cates and Nick Spencer, illustrated by Rod Reis, and published in 2018 as four monthly issues by Marvel Comics. It was the main story in a crossover event with some plot elements occurring in tie-in issues of related ongoing series also published by Marvel.
Publication history.
"Damnation" builds on events depicted in the 2017 crossover "Secret Empire" by Nick Spencer and various artists and the "Doctor Strange" ongoing series written by Donny Cates. The series was announced as a five-issue limited series on November 16, 2017, but later details reduced the count to four. The first issue was released February 21, 2018.
The crossover plot includes tie-in issues from some of Marvel's other contemporary ongoing series. These include "Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider" #15–17, "Doctor Strange" #386–389, "Iron Fist" #78–80, and "Johnny Blaze: Ghost Rider" #1.
"Damnation" is Cates' last story with Doctor Strange. When the limited series concluded, he left the monthly title, later going on to write his run of "Venom" from 2018 to 2021.
Plot.
Main plot.
In the 2017 crossover event "Secret Empire", Las Vegas was destroyed when HYDRA Helicarriers were dispatched to raze the city. After reclaiming his Sorcerer Supreme status from Loki, Doctor Strange uses his magic to restore it and resurrect the people who died. He is opposed by Mephisto, the ruler of Hell who has already claimed their souls as his own. He orchestrates events that causes his demons to bring Doctor Strange to his recently created Hotel Inferno. Mephisto claims that the remnants of Las Vegas were in his realm before it was restored. Hotel Inferno starts to have an effect on the people of Las Vegas. It also had an effect on Black Panther, Captain Marvel, Falcon, Hawkeye, and Jane Foster's Thor form where they were all turned into Ghost Rider-like creatures. The ghost of Doctor Strange's talking dog Bats sought out Wong so that he can help Doctor Strange. To help Doctor Strange, Wong summoned Blade, Doctor Voodoo, Moon Knight, Elsa Bloodstone, Ghost Rider, Iron Fist, Scarlet Spider, and Man-Thing to form the latest incarnation of the Midnight Sons.
Mephisto has turned Doctor Strange into a Ghost Rider-like creature. While Wong has assembled the Midnight Sons, they were overpowered by the demons roaming around Las Vegas. This attack got Wong and Bats' ghost separated from the rest. While the Midnight Sons were saved from the Ghost Riders by Scarlet Spider, Wong and Bats' ghost ran into Doctor Strange's Ghost Rider form.
Bats' ghost is able to possess the soulless body of Doctor Strange. While the Midnight Sons and Scarlet Spider fight the demons, Ghost Rider rides his motorcycle to the top of Hotel Inferno to confront Mephisto. After Mephisto removes the Ghost Rider from Johnny Blaze, he throws Blaze from the roof.
The Midnight Sons have been fighting the possessed Avengers for hours. Mephisto appeared on the battlefield and gloated on them sending Johnny Blaze to attack him. Just then, the possessed Avengers attack Mephisto as Wong revealed that Mephisto rendering his throne vacant has enabled Ghost Rider to become the new ruler of Mephisto's realm. After Doctor Strange returned from the Realm Between, he assisted the Midnight Sons and the Avengers into preventing Mephisto from returning to his realm to reclaim his throne. Though Doctor Strange defeated him, Mephisto fled back to his realm where he was defeated by Johnny Blaze and the different Ghost Riders from across the Multiverse. After Johnny Blaze sent Mephisto back to Earth, he was kept at the top of Hotel Inferno in countless restraints as Hotel Inferno remained on Earth. As Doctor Strange, the Avengers, and the Midnight Sons left upon Las Vegas returning to normal, Wong remained behind to keep an eye on Hotel Inferno's casino.
Tie-ins.
As Hotel Inferno starts to affect the people of Las Vegas, Doctor Strange fought Mephisto in a game of blackjack. The deal is that Mephisto had to return the souls to Las Vegas if Doctor Strange won and that Doctor Strange's soul would be claimed if Mephisto won. Though Doctor Strange won by cheating, Mephisto found out and had Doctor Strange tortured. After being tortured, Doctor Strange is rescued by Scarlet Witch, Clea and Loki and jump into action when they see the Avengers fighting demons. It's later revealed that the rescue was all an illusion and that Clea was a possessed Captain Marvel who posed as her to trick Doctor Strange. While inside Doctor Strange's body, Bats' ghost and Doctor Strange's mind find themselves in the Realm Between where they find the souls of those that Mephisto has trapped while he controls their bodies. It is here where Doctor Strange finds the souls of the Avengers that Mephisto is controlling as well as Dormammu. With the souls of the Avengers, Doctor Strange's soul plans to find a way out of the Realm Between. Doctor Strange then manages to find a way to escape the Realm Between and helps the souls of the Avengers return to their bodies.
During the rise of Hotel Inferno, Ben Reilly sees the effect that the hotel has caused on the citizens of Las Vegas and springs into action. While fighting demons alongside the Midnight Sons, Scarlet Spider gets separated from the group and faces Mephisto, who tries to trick him into giving up his path to redemption. When Ben refuses, he sends a possessed Kaine Parker after him. After a long fight, Ben manages to free Kaine from his possession and convinces him to help defeat Mephisto.
After being separated from the Midnight Sons, Iron Fist is found by Fat Cobra, who takes him to a fight tournament where the star fighter is Orson Randall, a former Iron Fist who died some time ago. After discovering what forces him to fight, Danny decides to help Orson escape by fighting in the tournament. During this time, the demon fight promoter brings in Danny's long-lost sister Miranda Rand-Kai, who is sent to fight Orson, as well as Fat Cobra's deceased mother. After fighting 12 monster demons, Danny and his friends are able to escape, though Orson dies during the fight. After sending Miranda, Fat Cobra and his mother to his place, Danny heads out to rejoin the Midnight Sons to defeat Mephisto.
After Johnny was thrown off the roof, he passes away. This is all part of Wong's plan. In Hell, Johnny Blaze finds the now-independent Spirit of Vengeance and persuades him to help reach Mephisto's throne. The two of them combine together and make their way through the circles of Hell until they reach Mephisto's throne. After fighting through demons, Johnny manages to claim the throne and becomes the new King of Hell.
Reception.
The series debuted to a mixed critical reception. The first issue received an average score of 6.9 out of 10 according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup. Because the central premise is based on an event that occurred a year earlier, "Comicbook.com" found the plot immediately felt dated. Although Jesse Shedeen felt the issue was too much setup and too little story, he said it captured the charm of the Cates' monthly "Doctor Strange" series. His review for "IGN" concludes that the plot may have worked better if dealt with exclusively within "Doctor Strange" instead of in a crossover. "Bleeding Cool" was less impressed, calling it a "shocking misfire from the top-downwards" that makes the reader hate Doctor Strange. The second issue was received more favorably by Pierce Lydon, who called it "fairly delightful" in a review for Newsarama. David Brooke praised the artwork in his review for "Adventures in Poor Taste".

Euura oblita

Euura oblita is a species of sawfly belonging to the family Tenthredinidae (common sawflies). The larvae feed on the leaves of willows ("Salix" species) and was first described by Jean Guillaume Audinet-Serville in 1823.
Description of the gall.
These are simple galls with the leaf rolled downwards affecting only one side of the leaf. The female forms the gall before she lays her eggs, with the caterpillar feeding inside the fold. It will also feed on ungalled parts of the leaf, or other leaves. In Great Britain the gall is found on white willow ("Salix alba") and crack willow ("S. fragilis"). Elsewhere it has been found on weeping willow ("S. babylonica") and almond willow ("S. triandra").
Redfern et al. state that, in Great Britain, it is safe to identify the galls of this species and "Euura destricta" by the foodplants. "E. destricta" feeds on bay willow ("S. pentandra"). In Great Britain, other "Euura" species do not form galls on these host plants.
Distribution.
The sawfly has been found in Great Britain (England and Wales) and the Netherlands.

Illaunloughan

Illaunloughan is a medieval Christian monastery and National Monument located in County Kerry, Ireland. The site is located on a tiny island of 0.3 acres (0.1 ha) in Portmagee Channel, a channel separating Valentia Island from the Iveragh Peninsula.
History.
A monastery was founded here in the late 7th century AD, but had ceased to exist by the 9th century. Two saints named Lochan appear in the Martyrology of Tallaght (c. AD 800); one could have been the founder, although "lochan" could also refer to seaweed. Illaunloughan may have been a stopping-off point for pilgrims travelling to Skellig Michael, which lies 17 km (9 nm) to the southwest. Excavation revealed middens containing the remnants of meat, oats, seabirds and fish. Also revealed were earthen oratories and casting of fine metalwork.
Up to the 20th century Illaunloughan was used as a cillín for the burial of unbaptised infants and as a graveyard by local people.
Description.
There are 8th-century dry stone oratories and altars ("leachta") and a gable shrine for the relics of the community's saints. These relics were decorated with quartz and scallop shells, perhaps in reference to the use of the shell on the Church of the Holy Sepulchre or the Camino de Santiago.

Bleisure travel

Bleisure travel (UK /ˈbleʒ.əʳ/ US /ˈbliː.ʒɚ/) is a portmanteau of “business” and “leisure”, and, it refers to a trend of business people to add on some sightseeing to a trip
The term bleisure was first published in 2009 by the Future Laboratory as part of their biannual Trend Briefing written by writer Jacob Strand, then a future forecaster working for The Future Laboratory, and journalist and futurologist Miriam Rayman.
In corporate business travel, extending a business trip for personal purposes is also known as “bizcation”
This phenomenon has been studied since 2011, and from this year on, a report shows that bleisure travel has been maintaining a constant growth, accounting for 7% of all business trips.
Bleisure traveller profiles.
Bleisure travellers can be described as “individuals who combine leisure with professional business obligations when abroad”.
The elements characterising bleisure travellers are different, and this makes it difficult to draw a defined profile of these individuals. Bleisure is a widespread practice among US travellers, especially for those working in Technology, Healthcare, Public Administration sectors. A report shows that US traveller adds bleisure in about half of the cases, 52% for International trips and 42% for domestic ones. The main reasons for travelling are conferences and conventions, team building, client meetings and presentations.
Bleisure travellers could be grouped according to various aspects, in particular gender, age and trip frequency.
Research indicates that females would be more likely than males to take bleisure trips. In both groups 20% of travellers would take one or more bleisure trips in a year, however women register higher rate: 8.5% against 6.8% of men.
Younger travellers (between 20 and 25) look significantly more likely to add weekends to their business trips, measuring a rate close to 15%. This result is two or three times higher than those for 45-50 age interval. Millennial travellers deserve a special attention because they appear to be the individuals shaping the future of business travel, nearly twice likely to travel for business than Baby Boomers. Millennials may work from home often or during the evening hours, and dedicate traditional working hours to leisure activities. In comparison to other age groups, Millennials are more likely to take bleisure trips. However, it is not clear whether this reflects unique preferences or transitory life events.
Frequent travellers taking 20 trips or more per year seem to be less than 5% likely to take a bleisure trip during the year, they would account for 8% of all bleisure trips. By contrast, one third of all bleisure trips would be taken by employees travelling once a month.
Factors influencing the phenomenon.
It seems evident that Millennials workers are increasingly demanding bleisure from their work trip. Despite the state-of-the-art technology available nowadays, Millennials still prefer face-to-face meetings to get business done, therefore travel is still important for business companies.
Worldwide, more than one in three business travellers will add a leisure component to at least one of their business trips this year (2021), said Jeanne Liu of the Global Business Travel Association.
Bleisure travel looks as a good opportunity to save on travel expenses, mostly for those who do not take a lot of vacation: 66% of US business traveller spend more money on leisure activities because of the money they save on travel. 60% take bleisure trips because do not have a lot of regular vacations. To decide whether to turn a business travel into bleisure or not, the employee takes into consideration travelling to exciting destinations, additional costs required to extend the trip, how close the trip is to the weekend, the number of nights they must stay for business, how affordable the hotel is, whether they have friends or family in the area, whether they can bring friends or family along. The general trend would indicate the addition of one or two days as the most frequent option, only 23% of bleisure travellers would extend their trips for more than three days. In many cases leisure days equal (37%) or even exceed business days (42%). The length of the business trip seems to be a crucial factor when considering extending the trip in 62% of cases. In particular, when business days are more than three, bleisure travellers are not only likely to extend the trip, but also to visit different cities in the area.
Bleisure in a Post Pandemic World.
A 2018 Expedia study found that more than 60% of business trips were extended for leisure purposes. But the concept of "any" travel largely ground to a halt in 2020 due to the pandemic, uncertainty of how the virus spreads and stay-at-home orders in the US and beyond.
The domestic pattern seems to be the one that will reach major growth in bleisure in the post-corona world. In addition, the new working conditions proved that most employees can effectively work remotely at any time. This contributed to raising the employee-employer trust relation and will allow an increase in bleisure travelling.
To enhance the traditional business travel experience, hotels are incorporating a wide range of technologies, in-app features, Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities, and more. Shoring up holes across a company's technical infrastructure could open up new opportunities for guest engagement and service offerings.
Advantages for employee and companies.
For the employees:
For the companies:
Main activities and destinations.
The more likely bleisure destinations are cities offering a combination of different elements, which could allow the travellers to add leisure time to their business trip, such as sightseeing locations, sport venues and cultural events.
The difference between the origin and the destination city seems to affect bleisure rates: in the case of domestic trips, the amount of bleisure is expected to be low because the two cities should be easily accessible and share similar culture. On the other hand, long intercontinental trips would offer the chance to know realities that are different from ordinary. Researches seem to confirm this trend: bleisure trips would account for 5.2% of the domestic trips and 9.7% of the international ones. The highest bleisure rate (18.4%) appears in international trips when the origin and destination cities are located in different geographical regions.
The top bleisure cities in US are: Honolulu (above 20%), Miami, Orlando, Las Vegas (12-15%) NYC, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego and Fort Lauderdale (9-12%). In Europe rates looks lower, this could be due to the shorter domestic and continental routes: Lisbon, Barcelona, Nice, Istanbul (8-11%), London, Dublin, Amsterdam, Moscow, Rome, Geneva, Paris, Madrid (6-8%).
Corporate policy.
Given that bleisure travel is a rising phenomenon, there is still no official regulation, therefore extending business trips for bleisure would have to be decided by management on a case-by-case basis. Some preventive measures could be followed in advance to avoid misunderstanding.

Bdote Memory Map

The Bdote Memory Map is an interactive online map and website by which the Dakota people trace their history and passed down memory of the region that is now referred to as the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. It allows viewers to explore the history of the region as told from an indigenous perspective. With video, audio, and other multimedia forms, the map provides the voices of Native speakers to tell their personal and ancestral stories of the region at the junction of the Mississippi and Minnesota Rivers, known by the Dakota people as Bdote, meaning "where the two waters come together".
History.
Mona Smith, a Sisseton-Wahpeton Dakota videographer, helped create the Bdote Memory Map in partnership with the Minnesota Humanities Center. The Memory Map grew out of a 2006 multimedia exhibition Mona Smith put on at the Ancient Traders Gallery entitled "City Indians," reflecting the seemingly ironic term attached to Dakota living in the Twin Cities. Smith, however, wished to express how the cities grew in areas that were already their land, the bdote. After the Minnesota Humanities Center extended funding, what began as a map of the region where Native Americans could attach post-it notes of their memories eventually became the online Bdote Memory Map.
Website layout.
When first entering the website, a four sided wheel, representing the traditional Dakota Medicine Wheel, prompts the visitor to explore the map or other writings on the Dakota and information about the website. The map itself is an interactive map of the Bdote region. There are several physical markers on the map that viewers are encouraged to click on, from which a specific memory or story will emerge. These can take the form of videos, audio recordings, writings and more from indigenous writers, artists, elders, students, and experts. Many of these writings will also prompt visitors with questions to reflect on the meaning of what they have learned. The website additionally includes teachers' guides for instruction on indigenous peoples in the classroom, informational resources about the Dakota, American Indian legal histories, as well as a variety of historical maps of both the Bdote and the larger Americas as well.
Current and future developments.
The Bdote Memory Map is still soliciting indigenous memories and stories of the Bdote region today to add to its platform. Smith is hoping to eventually expand the map's area of coverage to include indigenous stories from throughout the entire Mississippi region down to Louisiana.

It was named after Resolved Waterman, an early eighteenth century Greenville resident and landowner. Prior to the creation of the reservoir, the area was swampy, so a dam was constructed to create the reservoir and at the same time a causeway (now part of the Putnam Pike) was built so travelers no longer had to go around the swamp using Austin Avenue, which prior to the 1930s was known as (Old) Killingly Road.

St. Wenceslas (film)

St. Wenceslas () is a 1930 Czechoslovak historical film about Saint Wenceslas by Jan S. Kolár It was the most expensive Czech film to date, with the largest set constructed in Europe to accommodate an all-star cast of over a hundred, together with 5,000 extras for the lavish battle scenes.
Production.
Funding.
The film initially received a loan of 1 million crowns by the government of Czechoslovakia — half of the film's original budget. However the budget has been increased to 4 million crowns due to filming in winter. When the film was on a verge of being terminated the government lent the production another 1 million crowns. The prime minister František Udržal also provided military equipment as well as people from the state services to finish the movie.
Shooting.
The shooting started in September 1929. Exteriors were shot in Prokopské údolí, Šumava primeval forest, Křivoklát, Brdy and Unhošť. Sets of Wenceslaus' and Boleslaus' castles were built at the Strahov Stadium based on designs by Ludvík Hradský, who studied historical sources to be historically accurate. Large reflectors needed to be built for shooting the night scenes. The generators and planes were provided by the Ministry of Defence. Some scenes were filmed using five cameras. In December the production moved to Vinohrady's A-B Ateliers for interior scenes. The last big battle scene with Radslav was shot in March 1930. The whole film was shot over 82 filming days.
Post production.
Orchestral music was composed by Oskar Nedbal and Jaroslav Křička. It was originally thought that the music will be synchronized with the movie, but the lack of funds proved this impossible. 40-piece orchestra accompanied the movie at its premiere. Some of the later screenings were with non-original music.
Release.
The film was planned to be released in 1929, 1000 years after the supposed death of Wenceslaus. Finally released on 3 April 1930, the film wasn't a commercial success, because by that time sound films already replaced silent films in popularity. Another reason was that people were already tired of Wenceslaus celebrations that were occurring since 1929. The most of the film viewers were students at projections for schools who paid reduced admission fees.
Reconstruction.
The film was reconstructed by František Balšán under the director Kolár's supervision in 1971. The music score, long considered lost, was discovered in Czech Radio archives. The film was screened in Rudolfinum accompanied by live orchestra on 28 September 2010. The projection was telecasted live by Czech Television. The film was released on DVD in the same year.

Joseph Hughes (musician)

Joseph Hughes is a British bassist and songwriter, best known for being a member of the punk band The Flys and the new wave duo The Lover Speaks.
Background.
Hughes began his musical career in the mid-1970s as bassist in the band Midnight Circus. In 1976, the band evolved into the punk group The Flys, which also featured Neil O'Connor and David Freeman. The band recorded a number of singles, two EPs; "Bunch of Fives" (1977) and "Four From the Square" (1980), and two studio albums; "Waikiki Beach Refugees" (1978) and "Own" (1979) After the band split in 1980, Hughes went on to play bass in Tearjerkers, a band formed by Roddy Radiation.
In 1985, Hughes reunited with Freeman, who had suggested to him that they form a duo which became The Lover Speaks. The pair began writing material and also recruited the assistance of keyboardist Barry Gilbert. With the help of Dave Stewart of Eurythmics and Chrissie Hynde of The Pretenders, producer Jimmy Iovine received the duo's demo tape, who then helped them sign to A&amp;M Records in early 1986. Later that year, the duo's self-titled debut album, "The Lover Speaks", was released. Produced by Iovine, it contained the single "No More "I Love You's"", which peaked at No. 58 in the UK. A further two singles were lifted from the album; "Tremble Dancing" and "Every Lover's Sign". The latter reached peaked at No. 6 on the US "Billboard" Dance Club Songs Chart.
In 1987, The Lover Speaks would release a cover of Dusty Springfield's "I Close My Eyes and Count to Ten" as their next single, but it was not a commercial success. During that same year, the duo recorded their second album "The Big Lie", however A&amp;M Records decided not to release it. Having worked with Alison Moyet in 1986, the Freeman/Hughes-penned "Sleep Like Breathing" was lifted as the fourth and final single in late 1987 from her album "Raindancing". A duet with Freeman, the song reached No. 80 in the UK. The Lover Speaks would split in 1988.
In 1995, "No More "I Love You's"" was covered by Annie Lennox for her "Medusa" album. Released as a single in February, the song reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart that month and went on to secure Lennox a Grammy Award. The success of Lennox's cover saw Hughes and Freeman each receive a BMI award in 1996, as well as three Ivor Novello award nominations; the "PRS Most Performed Work", "International Hit of the Year" and "Best Song Musically and Lyrically".
In 2000, Hughes formed Cicero Buck with singer-songwriter Kris Wilkinson. The pair had initially met at the Exit/In in Nashville during 1998, and started a long distance relationship before Wilkinson relocated to the UK. The duo's debut album, "Delicate Shades of Grey", was released in 2002, and has been followed by "Humbucky" (2004), "A Taste of Wonderful" (EP, 2012) and "The Birth of Swagger" (2015). For the 2015 re-issue of "The Lover Speaks" album by Cherry Red, both Hughes and Freeman contributed to the album's booklet by providing song annotations.

Mary Esther MacGregor

Mary Esther Miller MacGregor, (August 27, 1872 – February 10, 1961) also known as Marian Keith, was a Canadian author of fiction.
Biography.
MacGregor was born in Rugby, Ontario in 1872. Her parents were John Miller, a schoolteacher, and Mary Brown Johnston. Both parents were of Scottish ancestry. She was the eldest of five children. She attended school in Edgar, Ontario, and the Orillia Collegiate Institute. She received her teacher's certificate from the Toronto Normal school in 1896. Beginning in 1899, she taught for seven years in Orillia.
She began writing in 1905. She contributed a column to Teacher's Monthly and then worked on the editorial staff of the Presbyterian Church's Sunday School Publications. In 1906 when she tried to publish her first novel she learned that her name, "Esther Miller" was already in use by another author so she chose to write under the pen name "Marian Keith". In 1909, she married Donald MacGregor who was one of the founding members of the United Church of Canada. During the time that they were married they moved several times to places in central Ontario to support her husband's ministerial career. She and her husband spent a fair amount of time in London, Ontario where she wrote seven of her novels. While in London, she formed a Sunday school for girls that was called the "Marian Keith Club".
In 1924, she wrote a book called "A Gentleman Adventurer" which she based on the life of a neighbour, Thompson Smith. Canadian literary scholars have cited this as her best work. In many of her novels, MacGregor sought to portray her connection between religious thought and social conscience in order to improve life for the poor and uneducated. She also wrote about tensions produced between Scottish and Irish settlers and the effects of education and urbanization on rural society.
MacGregor authored more than a dozen novels and several biographies, including "Courageous Women" which she co-authored with Lucy Maud Montgomery and Mabel Burns McKinley. MacGregor was a friend of Montgomery who was also married to a minister. She has been grouped with Montgomery and Nellie McClung as contributors to the revival of Canadian writing by women. Her ability to capture regional attitudes and her use of social anecdotes using a style characterized by zest and humour earned her a strong local following.
She and Donald retired to a farm on Georgian Bay but her husband was injured in a train accident and died in 1946. She spent the rest of her life living in Owen Sound, Ontario with her sister and died there in 1961.
Works.
Most if not all were published as by Marian Keith.

Infinity Countdown

"Infinity Countdown" is a 2018 comic book storyline published by Marvel Comics. The storyline leads into the "Infinity Wars" storyline.
Premise.
The story depicts the Ultron/Hank Pym going after the Infinity Gems that were recreated when the Multiverse was restored.
Plot.
Prologue.
Back during the "Time Runs Out" storyline, the Infinity Gems were destroyed during the Incursion that affected the Multiverse. When the Multiverse is restored by Mister Fantastic, it enabled the Infinity Gems to be restored. When the Space Gem was the first to manifest, it was targeted by the Frost Giant Snarr on Loki's behalf. He was killed by a somehow-revived Wolverine who claimed the Space Gem.
The Mind Gem was later found by Turk Barrett who used it for his own personal gain.
A giant-sized version of the Power Gem appeared on the desert planet Xitaung. After its discovery, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Nova Corps work together to guard it.
Captain Marvel later found the Reality Gem in an adjacent unidentified reality.
It was discovered that the Time Gem restored the planet Sakaar. While Amadeus Cho's Hulk form was fighting the Warlord, the Time Gem was unearthed by Super-Skrull who planned to use it to restore the Skrull Empire to its former glory.
Main plot.
At some point in the past, Loki, who wanted to know about the Soul Gem's location, visited Gardener. When Gardener didn't know where it was, Loki infected him with a poison that drove him mad to the point where he shattered Groot and took some of his splinters to grow an army of Flora Colossi. In the present, Gardener and his army of Flora Colossi are attacking Telferina. The Guardians of the Galaxy intercepted the army of Flora Colossi where it was revealed that Groot regenerated from a splinter and couldn't reach his normal size due to Gardener having taken all his splinters. Getting close to Gardener, Groot used his energy to cure Gardener of the poison. After being healed, Gardener's first action was to restore Groot to his original height as well as allowing him to speak in full sentences in the third person. A building-sized Flora Colossus named Scar was, however, still on a rampage. Meanwhile, Warbringer led the Chitauri fleet to the planet Xitaung in order to claim the Power Stone. In Madripoor, the Black Widow clone had traced a dead drop signal left by Wolverine. She found that Wolverine secretly left the Space Infinity Gem in her care.
The Guardians of the Galaxy managed to defeat Scar and join the Nova Corps in their fight against the Fraternity of Raptors and the Chitauri on Xituang. Meanwhile, Adam Warlock starts looking for the Soul Gem which brings him to the planet Saiph. Upon arriving, he finds that the planet has been conquered by the Ultron/Hank Pym and one of his infected victims is Silver Surfer.
After the Nova Corps decided to retreat from battle, Nova secretly thanked Robbie upon figuring out that someone could alter the size of the Power Gem. Using this revelation, Star-Lord shrunk it to the size of his hand. However, it was discovered that the Power Gem was an anchor for Xituang as it starts to crumble. The Guardians of the Galaxy and the Nova Corps use the Power Stone to destroy the Chitauri fleet as they escape from the doomed planet. Meanwhile, Adam Warlock heals Silver Surfer of the Ultron Virus. As the Ultron/Hank Pym is using Saiph as his base of operations and plans to unleash the Ultron Virus on a cosmic scale, Silver Surfer goes to look for Galactus. Even though Galactus is no longer a world-eater, Silver Surfer informs him of what is happening and asks for his help to stop the Ultron/Hank Pym's plot. However, the Ultron/Hank Pym had already launched rockets filled with the Ultron Virus in order to infect the entire galaxy while saving Earth as his last target.
Galactus initially refuses to consume Saiph due to the consequences of destroying it until he agrees with Silver Surfer. This results in Saiph and the rockets transporting the Ultron Virus being destroyed. The Ultron/Hank Pym got wounded in the escape and Adam Warlock claims the Soul Gem. Due to Galactus' hunger returning, Silver Surfer had to take him to an uninhabited planet to satisfy it. After the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Nova Corps regroup on Knowhere, Drax the Destroyer makes off with the Power Stone while Nova plans to rescue his brother from the Fraternity of Raptors. Star-Lord is summoned by Collector and Grandmaster who have with them a Reality Gem from another reality. The Phyla-Vell from an alternate reality where she operated as Captain Marvel appeared to retrieve it. Star-Lord gives the Reality Gem to her without a fight since it won't work outside her reality.
As the Guardians of the Galaxy escape to Oblitus, they are intercepted by Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror. Gamora attempted to take the Soul Gem from Adam Warlock. When Drax the Destroyer held onto the Soul Gem, he discovered that the Soul World inside is corrupted. Drax knocked out Gamora and made off with Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror. As the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy don't want to help Gamora pursue Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, she went off on her own. Doctor Strange tracks down the Mind Gem and finds it in Turk Barrett's possession as Turk managed to evade him. When Black Widow's clone arrives seeking out Doctor Strange where she wants to dispose of the Space Stone, he did not want to take it as he knows what would happen if they are in the same proximity. Using a magic spell, Doctor Strange spoke to the holders of the Infinity Gems and requested a parley to reform the Infinity Watch. He states to Adam Warlock, Black Widow's clone, Captain Marvel, Star-Lord, and Turk Barrett that they need to safeguard them from such calamities even if one of them is Thanos.
Tie-in.
After getting some information from the Contemplator's severed head, Magus found the Soul Gem on the surface of Ego the Living Planet. Before he can make plans to gather the other Infinity Gems and reshape the universe in his image, Magus is supposedly killed by the Ultron/Hank Pym who claimed the Soul Gem. After sending out some aliens that he infected with the Ultron Virus, the Ultron/Hank Pym learned that the ones that were sent after Wolverine were killed by him. Unbeknownst to the Ultron/Hank Pym, a soul fragment of Hank Pym entered the Soul Stone's Soul World where he encountered an elderly version of Gamora. Hank Pym's soul was told by the soul fragment of an elderly Gamora that he was going to be trapped here forever. As for Wolverine following his victory, he was approached by Loki, who warns him of an upcoming war where many villains will be coming after him and those who have the Infinity Gems.
As he now has the knowledge of the calamity that would come if the Infinity Gems were gathered in the same location again, Kang the Conqueror abducts Adam Warlock and convinces him to help secure the Soul Gem in exchange for the Time Gem. Adam is then sent back in time to receive counsel from Kang the Conqueror's Rama-Tut counterpart.
While doing a ride-sharing scam as he is driving through Greenwich Village, Turk Barrett stumbled upon a bunch of Skrulls attacking some monks that were delivering the Mind Infinity Gem to Doctor Strange at the Sanctum Sanctorum. Upon acquiring the Mind Gem during the fight, Turk Barrett begins to establish a criminal empire so that he can fill the void that was left when Kingpin left the criminal business. After briefly confronting Turk, Daredevil finds that he somehow can see again when in his presence. Turk uses the Mind Gem to get the judges to change their verdict on some criminals while gaining their loyalty and money. Daredevil caught wind of Turk Barrett's goals and warned him about playing in the criminal big leagues.
While on a mission in outer space, Doctor Strange discovers that Super-Skrull has the Time Infinity Gem. After a battle with Super-Skrull, Doctor Strange claims the Time Gem.
Sequel.
A sequel series titled "Infinity Wars" was released in 2018.

2016 Hwaebul Cup

The 2016 Hwaebul Cup was the fourth edition of the Hwaebul Cup (홰불, "Torch") celebrating North Korea's Youth Day. The competition was held between 27 July and 28 August 2016, with all matches played at the Sŏsan Stadium in P'yŏngyang. The competition was arranged in two phases, a group stage followed by a single-elimination play-off semi-finals, and a single-game final. April 25 won the title for the fourth straight time.
Group stage.
Thirteen teams took part in the group stage: : Amrokkang, April 25, Chebi, February 8, Hwaebul, Kyŏnggong'ŏp, Myohyangsan, Rimyŏngsu, Ryong'aksan, Ryongnamsan, Sobaeksu, Sŏnbong, and Wŏlmido. The teams drawn into two groups, with six teams in Group A and seven in Group B; February 8 and Ryongaksan were in Group B.
Matches began on 27 July 2016, with Sobaeksu, Sŏnbong, Amrokkang and Ryong'aksan each starting their campaigns with wins; Sobaeksu started off by winning their first two matches, Hwaebul, Rimyŏngsu, April 25, and Kyŏnggong'ŏp each started off with a win and a draw.
Group A.
Table based on known results. The first- and second-placed teams advanced to the semi-finals. Hwaebul won the group, and Sobaeksu finished second.
Known results.
Despite the heavy rain, Sobaeksu dominated Amrokkang right from the start, going up 1-0 early, then extending their lead to 2-0 shortly before the half on a penalty. After the restart, Sobaeksu added another goal to make it 3–0, but Amrokkang spoiled the clean sheet with a late goal, finishing the match at 3–1.
This was one of the last of the group stage matches. Myohyangsan opened the scoring in the tenth minute, with a long cross from number 14 on the left side to centre, where Jong Chol-min headed the ball into the net. They kept the pressure up, making numerous fast attacks. Ryongnamsan managed several attacks as well; towards the half-hour mark, Myohyangsan took advantage of Ryongnamsan's all-men-up posture, with number 10 seizing the ball in midfield to start a quick counterattack. He delivered a long pass to the rushing Ri Hyon-song, who dummied the last defender as well as the goaltender and shot the ball into the undefended net to extend his side's lead to 2–0 on the 30th minute. The second half, however, belonged entirely to Ryongnamsan in terms of ball possession and shots on net, but were unable to convert any of their chances, and the match ended 2–0 in favour of Myohyangsan.
Group B.
Table based on known results. Sŏnbong started out strong, winning their first two matches, but eventually slowed down, with April 25 and Kyŏnggong'ŏp finishing first and second and advancing to the semi-finals.
Known results.
April 25 began the match with an offensive stature, attempting to make quick breaks up either wing; Kyŏnggong'ŏp had set themselves up defensively, looking to take advantage of opportunities for quick counter-attacks. April 25 dominated the first half, having had possession of the ball for 80% of the opening 45 minutes, and having four corner kicks and six shots on goal, compared to Kyŏnggong'ŏp's 20% possession with only a single shot on goal and a single corner. They were, however, solid on defence, and April 25 were unable to take advantage of their superiority. Kyŏnggong'ŏp started the second half off with several bold, but fruitless attacks, but towards the end of the match April 25 was back on the offensive, though remained incapable of breaching Kyŏnggong'ŏp's defence. In the 88th minute, Kyŏnggong'ŏp advanced on a sudden counter-attack to score, but the goal was disallowed as off-side, and the match ended 0-0.
This match was a back-and-forth affair, but neither side was able to convert any of their chances until the 83rd minute, when Kyŏnggong'ŏp managed to break the deadlock with what proved to be the decisive goal.
This meeting between two powerhouses was well-attended by spectators. Two minutes after April 25 kicked off, Sŏnbong attempted a long-range shot from the midfield with Army's keeper (Ri Kang or Kim Ch'ŏl-nam) off of his line, but the shot went wide. April 25 then took control of the midfield area, stifling Sŏnbong's attempts to attack and successfully preventing any shots against their own goal. The first half ended goalless. Sŏnbong came out to start the second half offensively, having switched to a 4-2-4 formation. Both teams pressed their attacks, but it wasn't until late in the game that a goal came. April 25 managed to break out on the wing, taking a shot from left side that was parried by Sŏnbong's keeper. However, the rebound fell to Rim Ch'ŏl-min dashing up the middle, who put the ball up under the crossbar to give April 25 a 1–0 lead. Sŏnbong attacked fiercely over the last few minutes, but they were unable to get past 4.25's keeper. The victory secured April 25's place in the semi-finals.
Right from the start, this match was played with aggressive, attacking football. Ryong'aksan threatened early on with a two-man rush that led to a free kick just outside February 8's box; Ryong'aksan's Kim Ju-song, a free-kick specialist, converted the set piece to give his team the early lead. Ryong'aksan kept the pressure up through the first half, forcing February 8 to play defensively in the midfield. Later in the first half, 2.8 managed a counter, getting a long pass forward to striker number 7, who weaved past a defender and beat the goalie to level the score at a goal a piece; the first half ended at 1-1. February 8 continued to play a tight defensive game in the second half, looking to exploit chances to counterattack. Fifteen minutes from time, they managed to get the ball in midfield, delivering a pass forward to number 7, who scored his second of the game to give his side a 2–1 lead, and proved to be the winning goal for February 8.
Knock-out stage.
Semi-finals.
The top two finishers in each group advanced to the semi-finals, with the first-placed team in Group A playing the second-placed team in Group B, and vice versa. Scores are not known for either match, but Hwaebul won their match against Kyŏnggong'ŏp, and April 25 won their fixture against Sobaeksu.
Final.
Like all the other matches, the final was held at Sŏsan Stadium, on 28 August 2016, between April 25 and Hwaebul; the two domestic powers had each finished the group stage at the top of their respective groups. Right from the opening kickoff April 25 came out with an all-out offensive posture, and already in the 9th minute, April 25's An Il-bom scored from the right side of the box to give his team a 1–0 lead, placing the ball high into the net above Hwaebul's keeper (probably Song T'ae). The goal further energised the Army side, further intensifying their attacks. April 25 were awarded a penalty kick in the 13th minute, which An Il-bom converted to extend the lead to 2–0. Hwaebul then began concentrating on the midfield, trying to stifle 4.25 before they could get into Hwaebul's end of the pitch. These efforts paid off twenty minutes later, when Hwaebul's number 9 sent a long pass from midfield forward to striker number 22, Kim Jin-hyok, who dribbled the ball past the last defender and put it past April 25's keeper (likely Ri Kang) to cut the lead to 2–1 on the 32nd minute. There was no further scoring until the 82nd minute, when Hwaebul were awarded a penalty that was converted by Kim Jin-hyok, his second of the match, to equalise the score. After a goalless extra time, the match was decided on penalties; April 25's keeper made a save on Hwaebul's third attempt, giving his side a 3–2 win, and fourth straight Hwaebul Cup victory.

John Lovejoy Abbot

John Lovejoy Abbot (November 29, 1783 – October 17, 1814) was an American clergyman and librarian.
John Lovejoy Abbot was born in Andover on November 29, 1783. His father for whom he was named was a farmer. Abbot prepared for college at the Academy in his native town, and graduated from Harvard College in 1805. He studied theology in Andover under Dr. Ware. For a year (1807) he held the office of reader in the Cambridge Episcopal church, and the next year he occasionally preached in neighboring pulpits.
In 1811 he was made Harvard College Librarian, and held the office two years. In the spring of 1813, after his resignation from the Library, he was chosen pastor of the First Church in Boston. At his ordination on July 14, 1813, the sermon was by Professor Ware and the introductory prayer by Rev. Samuel Cooper Thacher, (Librarian, 1808–11). Abbot preached in this pulpit only a few Sundays ; the consumption which had been threatening him grew so much worse that in the fall he was obliged to ask a leave of absence. His parishioners had already become deeply attached to their new pastor and they unanimously voted in their resolutions of sympathy and regret, "that the expenses of supplying the pulpit be paid by the Society during the absence of the Rev. Mr. Abbot, and that his salary be continued."
About a month later, he married, 24 October, Elizabeth Bell Warland of Cambridge. In another month he sailed for Portugal in hopes of benefiting by the voyage. But on his return in June 1814, he was so little recovered that he was unable to resume preaching. He gradually grew worse until his death on October 17. At his funeral, which was from his church in Boston, Edward Everett preached the sermon.
He was a member of the American Antiquarian Society.

Arnold Schwarzenegger and LGBT rights

Arnold Schwarzenegger was an early opponent of same-sex marriage in the United States, including during his Governorship of California. He has since wavered in this opposition to reverse his political stance on LGBT rights.
Governorship.
2004.
In February 2004 when San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom ordered a change in the certificate application documents to allow for same-sex marriages, Governor Schwarzenegger opposed the move as being beyond the powers of the mayor but also said that he supports gay rights and has expressed support for a law to grant civil unions to gay couples.
On March 31, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger issued Executive Order S-6-04, which states that "All state agencies, departments, boards, and commissions shall recruit, appoint, train, evaluate and promote state personnel on the basis of merit and fitness, without regard to age, race, ethnicity, color, ancestry, national origin, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, religion, disability or other non-job-related factors."
On September 13, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger signed the California Insurance Equality Act into law, which expanded California's domestic partnership registry to require a health care service plan and a health insurer to provide coverage to the registered domestic partner of an employee, subscriber, insured, or policyholder that is equal to the coverage it provides to the spouse of those persons and would extend this requirement to all other forms of insurance regulated by the Department of Insurance and would deem that all of those policies as well as health care service plans and health insurance policies issued, amended, delivered, or renewed in this state on or after January 1, 2005, or January 2, 2005, as specified, provide registered domestic partner coverage equal to that provided to spouses.
On September 23, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger signs Omnibus Hate Crimes Bill into law, a bill that defines the legal term hate crime for all state and local agencies, encourages the creation of local law enforcement hate-crime protocols and increased hate crime awareness training for law enforcement officers.
On September 25, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger signs Omnibus Labor &amp; Employment Non-Discrimination Bill into law, a bill to unify all state anti-discrimination codes to match the California Fair Employment and Housing Act. In essence it adds sexual orientation and gender identity anti-discrimination protections to the California government, labor, military and veterans, public utilities, unemployment and insurance, and welfare and institutions codes.
On September 27, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger signs SB 1193 into law, a bill to provide a $10,000 death benefit to the surviving spouse or designated beneficiary of a member of one of the state military reserves (California National Guard, State Military Reserve, or Naval militia). The bill, retroactive to March 1, 2003, allows LGBT partners of military personnel be listed as designated beneficiary.
On September 29, 2004, Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed AB 1520, a bill that would have established the California Veterans Memorial Commission. Also that same day, he signed the Domestic Partner Technical Clean-up Bill into law, which makes technical changes to the California Domestic Partner Rights &amp; Responsibilities Act, including effective date of community property, third party obligations, allowing the creation of pre-partnership agreements for previously-registered couples, etc.
2005.

Because moneys in the Public Employees' Retirement Fund would be used for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation, and revise and recast the provisions described above in connection with the extension of the rights and duties of marriage to domestic partnerships that occurred on and after 2005. Because moneys in the Public Employees' Health Care Fund would be used for a new purpose, this bill would make an appropriation and entitle a retired member and his or her domestic partner to the same entitlements as described above, if specified criteria are satisfied, including providing an affidavit signed by the member and domestic partner under penalty of perjury relative to the member's service retirement effective date or disability retirement date and expand those provisions to provide that a conservatee retains the capacity to enter into a domestic partnership, as specified.

Gay Rights Watch commented that: "Governor Schwarzenegger, despite the huge blow he dealt to the gay and lesbian community by vetoing AB 849, has signed more pro-LGBT laws than any other Governor in California history--and probably in the US for that matter."

Amphibia (TV series)

Amphibia is an American animated television series created by Matt Braly that premiered on Disney Channel on June 17, 2019. The series features the voices of Brenda Song, Justin Felbinger, Bill Farmer, and Amanda Leighton.
The series has been renewed for a third season, which is set to premiere on October 2, 2021.
Premise.
The series chronicles the adventures of an independent and fearless 13-year-old Thai-American girl named Anne Boonchuy (Brenda Song). After Anne steals a mysterious music box on her 13th birthday, it magically transports her and her friends Sasha Waybright (Anna Akana) and Marcy Wu (Haley Tju) to the world of Amphibia, a wild marshland tropical island full of anthropomorphic amphibians and threatening creatures, where they are separated (Anne transported to a forest, Sasha to Toad Tower, and Marcy to Newtopia). A month later, Anne is taken in by the Plantars, a family of frogs living in the town of Wartwood: the excitable young Sprig (Justin Felbinger); unpredictable and adventurous baby pollywog Polly (Amanda Leighton); and overprotective and traditional grandfather Hop Pop (Bill Farmer). As she bonds with her newfound family, Anne gradually learns what it means to be a hero and develop a true friendship, all the while trying to find her friends and return home. The matter is complicated when Sasha allies with Captain Grime (Troy Baker), leader of the warfaring toads of Toad Tower, who seek to control their home of Frog Valley. 
In season two, Anne and the Plantars go on a road trip to the Amphibian capital, Newtopia, to learn the secrets of the Calamity Box and find a way to get Anne home. There, Anne reunites with Marcy, who offers to help restore the box's power through a series of ancient trials, unaware that Newtopia's King Andrias (Keith David) secretly has his own plans for them. Meanwhile, Sasha and Grime plot to invade Newtopia and overthrow the monarch, allowing the toads to rule over all of Amphibia.
In season three, Anne and the Plantars are transported to Los Angeles where the frog family will now have to adjust to the human world while keeping their identities a secret.
Production.
Development.
On February 19, 2018, "Amphibia" was greenlit by Disney Channel alongside "The Owl House". The series was created and executive-produced by Matt Braly, previously a storyboard artist on "Gravity Falls" and later a director on both "Gravity Falls" and "Big City Greens". According to his Twitter account, he had been working on the series for almost two years before being greenlit, though he began to conceive the project while work on "Gravity Falls" began to conclude.
On May 15, 2019, Disney Channel renewed "Amphibia" for a second season ahead of its premiere.
On June 23, 2020, the show was renewed for a third season ahead of its second-season premiere. In a Reddit AMA, Braly referred to "Amphibia" as a "three act show" with season two as the "2nd act", implying that Season 3 will serve as the final season of the show.
Writing.
The show was based on Braly's childhood trips to Bangkok, Thailand. The series' tone was inspired by films by Aardman Animations and Studio Ghibli, while its storytelling format was inspired by "Gravity Falls" and "Steven Universe". Braly was also inspired by video games such as "The Legend of Zelda" and "Chrono Trigger" when creating the series. Other inspirations for the series include shows Braly watched in his childhood, such as "" and Disney's "Gargoyles"; he precisely cited "Gargoyles" as an inspiration for the series' story arc. According to Braly, one of the reasons he created the series was because he wanted a show whose lead character had a similar arc to "Gravity Falls" character Pacifica Northwest, as he felt that "to have this character change so drastically was so rewarding, and that's why [he] knew [he] wanted [his] own show to have some of that element as well". The character of Sprig went through several changes through development, with the developers constantly giving him different ages, before choosing to make the character a younger brother-like figure for Anne. Similarly, Anne, Sasha, and Marcy were originally fifteen-years-old because they wanted the series to have a high school-like feel, but were aged down in order to appeal to the series' target demographic; due to this, the trio often realizes actions more akin to high school students, such as driving and having part-time jobs.
The series marks the first animated show to have a Thai-American lead. Braly, who is Thai-American, chose to make the series' lead character, Anne Boonchuy, Thai-American because he wanted more Thai characters in television series. According to Braly, Anne was loosely inspired by his grandmother. He described Anne being Thai-American as "a number one priority", as he wanted Thai-American kids to see themselves reflected on television. Braly also made the character dark-skinned due to his mother's family being tanned. Season 3, which is set on Earth, further delves into Anne's Thai heritage, including an episode set on a Wat Thai temple on Los Angeles. Braly described the temple's representation in the episode as "pretty accurate", as it is important for him to represent Thai culture accurately.
Braly chose to make the series to be centered around a frog-populated world because he felt that, due to how frogs change from tadpoles to frogs, they were perfect for the series' theme of change. Braly also implemented themes involving social classes and environmental awareness into the series, with Anne interacting with frogs of several different social backgrounds and learning to "appreciate the natural world around her".
Three of the series' four writers are women, since Braly felt necessary due to the show centering on a teenage girl. Storyboard artists are allowed to pitch their own ideas for an episode, a practice Braly took from his time at "Gravity Falls". Braly wanted the series to feature intense sequences, yet still being appropriate for all ages, constantly checking-in whether a scene is too terrifying for children and whether is what the scene is intended to be.
Casting and voice recording.
On March 27, 2019, it was revealed that Brenda Song would star in the series as the voice of Anne Boonchuy. In April 2019, it was reported that Justin Felbinger would voice Sprig Plantar in the series. On May 15, 2019, it was reported that Amanda Leighton and Bill Farmer joined the cast as the voices of Polly and Hopediah "Hop Pop" Plantar, respectively. Over 50 actresses auditioned for the role of Anne, including Anna Akana and Haley Tju. While the role ultimately went to Song, Braly cast Akana and Tju as Anne's human friends, Sasha and Marcy respectively, instead. According to Braly, certain roles were written with a specific actor in mind, such as King Andrias, who is voiced by Keith David.
Muppet performer Matt Vogel (as Kermit the Frog) made an appearance in the season 2 episode "Swamp and Sensibility". However, Kermit himself (whom Vogel performed since 2017) was credited for the role in promotional material; Kermit previously appeared in two promotional web videos for the series, as well as in a D23 Expo panel promoting both the series and "Big City Greens".
According to Braly, Song add-libbed several jokes during recording. Similarly, Alex Hirsch improvised several lines for his appearance in the season two episode "Wax Museum". During the COVID-19 pandemic, cast members had to remotely record their lines from their homes, after which they sent their lines to the series' editors.
The guest stars for season three include Whoopi Goldberg, RuPaul, Kate Micucci, Brad Garrett, Anika Noni Rose, Archie Yates, Wallace Shawn, Wayne Knight, Jason Ritter, Dana Davis and Melissa Villaseñor. Rose previously worked alongside David and season 2 guest star Jenifer Lewis on Disney's "The Princess and the Frog", a film Braly is fond of.
Animation.
Rough Draft Korea, Sunmin Image Pictures, and Saerom each provide animation. Braly chose those animation studios due to them still working with hand-drawn animation, a style Braly favored for the series. The animators spend three to four months working on pre-production, with an episode taking about nine months to complete. Forty staff members at Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California also worked on the series.
James Turner, a British illustrator most well known for his work on the "Pokémon" series of games (having created several Pokémon designs and worked as the art director for "Pokémon Sword and Shield"), provided artwork during the initial stages of the project. The series' visuals were inspired by Jim Henson's 1982 film "The Dark Crystal" and the 1977 animated adaptation of "The Hobbit". The series' environments were also inspired by natural settings. According to Braly, storyboarding for an episode begins after its script is finished. Braly said that the different character designs for Anne and Marcy, in spite of both characters having Asian backgrounds, because the producers "never wanted to be trapped into a character design just because of what people might think an Asian person 'should' look like in a cartoon", as the characters "are representations of folks, not caricatures".
By March 24, 2020, Disney Television Animation was closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with work on the series continuing remotely. By that point, the producers had started storyboarding the season 2 finale, while other episodes were only partially completed.
Music.
T. J. Hill composed the score for the series. During production on the series, Leslie Wolfhard, wife of storyboard artist Steve Wolfhard, pitched to the producers a song, which they ended up using in the season 1 episode "Taking Charge". On July 23, 2020, Hill created a SoundCloud playlist featuring 10 tracks from the first season's score. 
A song titled "Welcome to Amphibia", performed by Celica Gray Westbook, was originally intended to serve as the series' theme song. However, the song was later discarded in favor of an instrumental theme. According to Braly, "Welcome to Amphibia" was written due to orders from Disney, but he eventually convinced the studio to use an instrumental theme instead, as he disliked the song because he felt it didn't fit with the show or its main character.
Hyper Potions composed a new version of the instrumental opening for the show's first "Theme Song Takeover" video. A third version of the opening, with lyrics by writer Dan Siegel, was written for the second "Theme Song Takeover" video.
The first season finale, "Reunion", features the song "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers. Braly said that he constantly listened to the song while developing the relationship between Anne, Marcy, and Sasha, so, when work began on "Reunion", Braly chose to use the song for the scene in which Sasha tries to sacrifice herself.
On April 23, 2021, an extended play album, titled "Amphibia: Battle of the Bands", was released. The album features the songs "Heartstomper", written by TJ Hill and performed by Akana, and "No Big Deal", written by Adam Gubman and performed by Song, Akana, and Tju, as well as instrumental covers of both songs by Hill, Todd McClintock and Adam Gubman, respectively.
Season three will feature a Christmas special with a new song written by Rebecca Sugar of "Steven Universe" fame; Braly previously served as a writer and storyboard artist in the "Steven Universe" episode "Lars and the Cool Kids".
Marketing.
On July 19, 2018, during the "Star vs. the Forces of Evil" and "Big City Greens" panel at San Diego Comic-Con, Disney released an early version of the intro for the series. They also gave away a limited-edition plush toy of Sprig Plantar.
On April 26, 2019, Disney FanFest released a music video for a vocal version of the opening theme titled ″Welcome to Amphibia″ performed by Celica Gray Westbrook and a two-minute clip during a livestream. It was discussed to be used as the intro song.
On May 14, 2019, Disney Channel released the trailer, with Disney Channel releasing the final version of the intro 3 days later.
"Amphibia" also included shorts, beginning with "Teen Girl in a Frog World". The shorts premiered on September 3, 2019.

Bekah Burbank of "LaughingPlace.com" praised the series' ability to balance its humor and its terror elements, as well as its pacing, characters, and animation, stating that ""Amphibia" is clever and goofy with plenty of jokes to keep kids laughing and just enough scary content to hold their attention. The show moves quickly and is broken into two 11-minute episodes that, at least for the premiere, form one complete chapter. The animation is bouncy and colorful and the characters are a delight". "Collider"s Dave Trumbore gave the series' first two episodes a 4 stars rating, feeling that they "[served] as a great introduction to the series".

Francis James Browne

Francis James Browne (1879–1963) was professor of obstetrics and gynaecology and first director of the obstetric unit at University College Hospital, London, which was opened in 1926. He was known as "FJ".
Browne was appointed professor at the University of London and the first full-time director of the newly established Obstetric Unit, opened by the Prince of Wales in 1926.
Browne established a modern labour ward service, with one senior sister in charge and improved antiseptic and aseptic techniques. He instituted antenatal and postnatal clinics and recruited many (later distinguished) assistants, including Leslie Williams, Harold Malkin, Chassar Moir, Robert Kellar, Vivian Barnes, Max Rosenheim, Josephine Barnes and Aileen Dickens.
He re-organised the teaching of medical students, and residential accommodation was provided. Systematic teaching of obstetric and gynaecological dressers was introduced. Standards of the district obstetric service were greatly improved, an important service in the days when most deliveries were still domiciliary.
Browne was a fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine and a member of the Gynaecological Visiting Society (GVS), elected in 1927. He became a founding fellow of the College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (1929). He was president of the (RSM) Section of Obstetrics and Gynaecology for the 1945/6 session.
In 1947 he was invited to give the ﬁrst William Meredith Fletcher Shaw Memorial Lecture. His subject was hypertension in pregnancy, summarising his life's work.
Biography.
Browne was born on 1 October 1879 to William and Sarah Browne, in Tullybogly, County Donegal, Ireland, a small community 25 miles west of Londonderry. He was the fourth of eight children, and attended Balleighan Primary school.
He studied medicine at Aberdeen University on a scholarship, starting in 1901. In 1902 he was awarded the Thompson Bursary for medical students entering their second year. He qualified MB ChB, passing his finals in 1906 with ‘highest honours’ and distinctions in pathology, medical jurisprudence and public health.
Browne worked as colliery doctor at the Arrael Griffin (Six Bells) Colliery in Abertillery in South Wales.
The obstetric experience in Abertillery triggered a lasting interest in the subject, and led to the desire to specialize in this branch of medicine. Browne had attended postgraduate courses in London (1911) and Edinburgh (1912 and 1913), and in 1918 he took time off his practice to do a 3-month resident post at the Edinburgh Royal Inﬁrmary.
Following his short period as a gynaecological resident, Browne wrote on 18 November 1918 to Dr. John Ballantyne, one of the teachers on the postgraduate courses he had attended, applying for the post of obstetric resident at the Simpson Memorial Hospital in Edinburgh. Ballantyne (1861–1923) was the outstanding pioneer of antenatal care.
During the First World War he served as an officer with the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was a foundation fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
Browne was admitted to the fellowship of the Edinburgh Obstetric Society in 1919, and became a regular attender and presenter of papers at the society's meetings, later becoming editor of the "Transactions". He was invited to join the Medical Research Council in 1921 and investigated, in collaboration with Dr WR Logan, the causes of abortion and intrauterine death. He wrote on intranatal infection and pre-eclampsia and investigated the fetal age, length and weight of over 600 fetuses delivered at various stages of pregnancy.
In 1923 Browne was appointed assistant physician at the Edinburgh Royal Inﬁrmary and the Simpson Memorial Pavilion. Ballantyne (who died that year) referred to his "sterling quality of frankness, fairness and loyalty. He has an infectious enthusiasm for his work and in his writing he marshals his facts with logical accuracy and force".
Clinical duties and research now became Browne's main priorities. In addition, he was recognised as the outstanding teacher of medical students in Edinburgh. In 1925 he was awarded the Edinburgh DSc (Doctor of Science) degree and promoted to chief physician.
A Royal Commission on university education in London had recommended in 1913 the establishment of clinical professorial units in the London medical schools. In 1919, a generous offer by the Rockefeller Foundation was made, firstly to Oxford University but subsequently to University College Hospital, London, leading to the establishment in 1920 of new medical and surgical units at UCH. A new obstetric hospital was built, the foundation stone being laid by King George V in 1923, and opened by the Prince of Wales in 1926.  Browne was appointed professor at the University of London and the first full-time director of the newly established Obstetric Unit, and held the post until his retirement in 1946.  He established a modern labour ward service, with one senior sister in charge and improved antiseptic and aseptic techniques.  
His first assistants were Leslie Williams and Harold Malkin, both of whom become distinguished consultants in due course. Among the most famous of his assistants were Chassar Moir who joined the UCH obstetric unit in 1929 and Max Rosenheim who came from the medical unit to the obstetric unit in 1934. Other assistants included Norman White and Tim Flew who both became consultants at UCH, Robert (later Professor) Kellar, Vivian Barnett, Fouracre Barnes, Aileen Dickens and Josephine Barnes.
He died on 17 August 1963.

The Owl House

The Owl House is an American animated fantasy television series created by Dana Terrace that premiered on Disney Channel on January 10, 2020. The series stars the voices of Sarah-Nicole Robles, Wendie Malick and Alex Hirsch.
In November 2019, the series was renewed for a second season prior to the series premiere, which premiered on June 12, 2021. In May 2021, the series was renewed for a third season consisting of three specials, ahead of the second season premiere, later announced to be the final season of the series.
"The Owl House" has been highly praised by both critics and audiences and has become particularly notable for its LGBTQ+ representation compared to other Disney media, including becoming the first Disney property to feature a same-sex couple in leading roles. The series also won an award for Children's &amp; Youth Programming at the 2021 Peabody Awards.
Premise.
Luz Noceda is a teenage Dominican-American human girl from Gravesfield, Connecticut who accidentally stumbles upon a portal to another world instead of going to a juvenile detention summer camp. She arrives on an archipelago known as the Boiling Isles, formed from the remains of a dead Titan, and befriends the rebellious witch Eda Clawthorne (alias "The Owl Lady") and her adorable demon roommate King. Despite not having magical abilities, Luz pursues her dream of becoming a witch by serving as Eda's apprentice at the Owl House and ultimately finds a new family in an unlikely setting.
The second season, directly following the events of the first season finale, follows the main protagonists working together to return Luz to the Human Realm, help Eda confront her curse, and search for the truth about King's past while contending with the tyrannical Emperor Belos and his minions.
Production.
Background.
Dana Terrace first began conceiving early ideas for a series about a girl learning to be a witch in late 2016. While working on "DuckTales", Terrace didn't feel "fulfilled artistically or emotionally", so she began to research influences and work from her college years, eventually rediscovering the works of artists such as Hieronymus Bosch and Remedios Varo, inspiring her to create a show for Disney that features strong surreal visual elements.
In 2018, it was reported that Dana Terrace, previously a storyboard artist for "Gravity Falls" and later a director on the 2017 "DuckTales" reboot, was creating and executive-producing an animated series, titled "The Owl House", for Disney Television Animation. The series was set originally for a 2019 release, but it was delayed for a 2020 release. Terrace is the fourth woman to create a series for Disney Television Animation, after "Pepper Ann" with Sue Rose, "Doc McStuffins" with Chris Nee, and "Star vs. the Forces of Evil" with Daron Nefcy.
Development.
Terrace said that the general lore for the series was inspired by art and storybooks by Hieronymus Bosch. According to Terrace, the hardest decision when creating the series was whether to implement potential lore elements in the series. Terrace also stated the lore of the series is "70 percent made up", with writers also drawing inspiration from books about witchcraft for spells and character names, to add depth to its lore. The "Pokémon" franchise served as a strong influence on the series.
Eda was the earliest character created for the show. Terrace said the character is inspired by "the women who raised me. My aunts, my Nana and my mom, they're all in the Owl Lady". The second character created was King, who was described by Terrace as "a little guy that wants to be big", something she related to. Luz was the final main character created and was inspired by consultant and story artist Luz Batiste. Batiste agreed to let Terrace use her name for the series' main character on the condition that she be Dominican-American, which Terrace agreed to. The character's personality was inspired by "stories of each other about what dorks we were in high school", as well as parts from Terrace's own childhood. Alex Hirsch, Terrace's partner and creator of the TV series "Gravity Falls", on which Terrace served as a storyboard artist and revisionist, serves as a creative consultant on the series.
Several of the series' themes are inspired by Terrace's childhood. The series features themes of uniqueness and conformity, which were inspired by Terrace's experience at school, where she was mocked for her habit of drawing roadkill, only to meet people with similarly different personalities when she went to a new school. The series also explores the idea of getting close to fulfilling a dream, yet being unable to completely fulfill it, inspired by how Terrace was told that she wouldn't be a cartoonist, only to "[find her] own path".
Hirsch said that while there was a concern with the Disney Channel over the series' horror elements, Terrace nevertheless chooses to feature horror elements, arguing that "Disney is the full spectrum of emotions, creatures and scary things". Terrace said that Disney "allowed me to do more than I thought they would". Terrace also said that the producers "[don't] want to pull [their] punches on the show" in its horror elements, as she "loved being a little scared" as a child, though she also wanted to balance them with comedy and heartfelt moments. She described the magic elements on the show as "a framing device for the grounded emotional stories" featured in the series.
According to Terrace, the series initially had a darker tone, as she wanted to create a TV series targeted at older audiences "where things like whimsy and darkness can coexist", but had to tone it down during season 1 to find a compromise between her personal ideas and Disney executives' wishes, though she nevertheless was proud of the final product. Season 2 will have a tone closer to what Terrace originally intended.
Animation.
The show is animated by Rough Draft Korea, Sunmin Image Pictures, and Sugarcube Animation. Terrace said that the visual style was inspired by paintings by Remedios Varo, John Bauer and Hieronymus Bosch, as well as Russian architecture. By December 2019, the show had 120 people working on the show, including those in the animation studios, and 50 staffers on the pre-production crew.
Spencer Wan served as animation supervisor during season one. Disney initially refused for the series to have an in-house animator, feeling Wan may not meet their "overseas pipeline", but he was eventually hired. Kofi Fiagome serves as animation supervisor for season two. Terrace also provided rough animation for three season 2 episodes.
Ricky Cometa served as art director for the series. Cometa first became involved with the series when Terrace began working on the pilot, before the series was green-lighted by Disney, and was approached by Terrace, a fan and friend of Cometa's because she "really wanted to work with someone who I vibed with, someone whose style I knew, that could execute the kind of weird junk I wanted to do", and Cometa agreed to work on the series due to being interested in the concept. Cometa said that he wanted to "[t]ry and show the dualities between the Demon Realm and the human realm, and with a little twist of demons and eyeballs and bones and whatnot". He also didn't want all demons on the show to have scary appearances, as they are supposed to represent normal people within the show.
Terrace said that Luz's design was "challenging", as she struggled to create a design for Luz that didn't make her look too old or that felt too much like a costume. Cometa eventually created a t-shirt for Luz to wear that is "low key, and like a nod to all our fellow nerds out there". Cometa said that it was "fun" to design demonic versions of commonplaces. The animators also changed real-life elements to further distinguish the Boiling Isles from Earth, such as making the ocean purple.
On July 19, 2019, Terrace announced that T. J. Hill composed the series' score. On January 10, 2020, Hill said that the score features "interesting and experimental sounds that [he] had a ton of fun cooking up". In the second season, "Gravity Falls" and "Star vs. the Forces of Evil" composer Brad Breeck took over as composer.
By March 2020, Disney Television Animation was closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the production crew to work on season 2 remotely from their homes.
Broadcast.
On June 10, 2019, the trailer premiered during the show's Annecy 2019 panel. It was uploaded to Disney Channel's YouTube channel a day later.
The show's main title sequence was released on July 19, 2019, during San Diego Comic-Con 2019. The show released a sneak peek and an official end credit sequence on October 4, 2019, during a panel at New York Comic Con 2019. The show's main title sequence for season 2 was released on May 17, 2021. A trailer for season 2 was released on June 3, 2021.
Season 1 aired its 19th and final episode on August 29, 2020. On November 21, 2019, the series was renewed for a second season prior to the first season's debut. On May 17, 2021, the series was renewed for a third season, which will consist of three 44-minute specials, ahead of the second season premiere. The episode order was much shorter than the 10-20 episodes they were anticipating, only for Terrace later to confirm in a question to a fan that it will be the final season.
When asked about the series’s future on Twitter, Terrace expressed interest in continuing it in other media. This content could include comics and doing a limited series centering on Eda's past, and other potential spin-offs, while stating the three specials of Season 3 were the end of the main story, persuading fans to ask Disney regarding more content based on the show.
"The Owl House" had its first international debut in Canada on January 12, 2020, in Southeast Asia on March 20, 2020, in Latin America on April 13, 2020, in France on April 15, 2020, in South Korea on May 23, 2020, in Japan on July 23, 2020, in the UK &amp; Ireland on August 10, 2020, in the Netherlands on August 24, 2020, in Spain on October 3, 2020, in Africa on October 26, 2020, and in Romania on January 2, 2021.
The entire first season was added to Disney+ on October 30, 2020. The first five episodes of the second season were added to Disney+ on July 21, 2021, while episodes six through ten were added on August 18.
The show was supposed to premiere on January 2, 2021 in Hungary and The Czech Republic, but it was ultimately not aired in those countries due to the series' positive stances towards the LGBTQ+ community.
LGBTQ+ representation.
"The Owl House" has been praised for featuring several characters who are LGBTQ+, in particular the romance between the characters of Luz Noceda and Amity Blight. On July 7, 2020, series creator Dana Terrace implied this, when responding to a fan who posted a screenshot from the upcoming episode "Enchanting Grom Fright" on Twitter which showed one of the characters in the show, Amity Blight, putting her hands on the shoulders of Luz Noceda, the show's main protagonist, and looking into Luz's eyes. Claiming "there is no heterosexual explanation" for Amity's action, Terrace responded, "there really isn't". On August 8, 2020, the episode, written by Molly Ostertag, aired, and it featured a scene in which Luz and Amity dance together while casting spells to defeat "Grom," a demon that manifests as their deepest fears. The animation supervisor for the show, Spencer Wan, referred to their intimate dance as "the gay thing" and the first time he got to "do anything even remotely queer."
On September 2, 2020, during a Reddit AMA, Dana Terrace confirmed that Amity is intended to be a lesbian and that Luz is bisexual. The two girls represent Disney's second animated LGBTQ+ characters after Sheriff Blubbs and Deputy Derland in "Gravity Falls," and the first to be unambiguously portrayed as such. In the episode "Understanding Willow", one of the main characters (Willow Park) is shown to have two dads. Some noted that beginning of the show's second season, which began airing in 2021, continued to build out the relationship between Amity and Luz, with Luz reciprocating Amity's feelings at the end of "Escaping Expulsion" and both blushing at each other. Others praised Amity's character evolving outside her "relationship with Luz." 
The series was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids and Family Programming in 2021 and won a Peabody Award for "...giving queer kids a welcome template...to explore their own budding creative energies."
On July 10, 2021, the episode "Through the Looking Glass Ruins" premiered, which focused heavily on Gus' development as a character and how much he's grown since his last major appearance. However, the episode received significant attention and press over Luz and Amity's growing relationship and its ending, in which Amity kisses Luz on the cheek. The episode "Eda's Requiem" features a character named Raine Whispers, who goes by they/them pronouns and is voiced by transgender and non-binary actor Avi Roque. Raine is both Disney TVA’s and Disney's first transgender and/or non-binary character. Roque said that the character is based around their own experience, with the character's skin color to reflect their actual skin color, praised the show as normalizing queer identity, and said it was an honor to voice Raine. In the episode, Eda Clawthorne is shown to have feelings for Raine, confirming Eda to be queer. The subsequent episode, "Knock, Knock, Knockin' on Hooty's Door", reveals that Eda and Raine were formerly dating, before breaking up. The episode also has Luz and Amity asking each other out, officially becoming a couple. GLAAD praised the episode, saying they were excited to see a "wonderful and affirming message" from the series. Jade King of "TheGamer" praised the series for having a fictional universe where queer characters can "learn to love themselves without the fear of ridicule," comparing it to the similar approaches in "Steven Universe" and "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power", noting the relationship between Luz and Amity.

Shorts.
"Look Hooo's Talking".
A series of shorts, modelled after the aftershow format, titled "Look Hooo's Talking" premiered on the official Disney Channel YouTube channel. The shorts, which are usually posted a day after an episode's airing but air right after its TV premiere, depict two live-action owls named Horus Herashoo and Owlyvia Kim talking about the events of the most recent episode and pick apart some of the details that potentially will make an impact later in the show. At the end of each episode, the credits quickly scroll by, but when paused reveal the name of the "crew" which consists of names of the actual crew of the show, but with re-imagined bird name puns such as the creator, Dana Terrace, being renamed Danightingale Terrace.
Starting with the episode "Sense and Insensitivity", the format retired.
"Owl Pellets".
In April and May 2020, Disney Channel began releasing a series of comedic shorts called "Owl Pellets" involving Luz, Eda, and King's antics with magic and the exploration of the Boiling Isles.
Reception.
Critical reception.
"The Owl House" has received widespread critical acclaim. Emily Ashby of "Common Sense Media" rated the show 4 out of 5 stars and said putting different elements together made the series quirky and likable. It was also described as well written and animated, and speculated that "[the show] likely will be one you will want to watch alongside your older kids and tweens, giving you the opportunity to discuss these kinds of themes as they come up." "LaughingPlace.com"s critic praised the series for its unique visuals and voice acting, stating "The performances fit together beautifully as the diversity in their delivery showcases the characters’ unique roles in the Demon Realm." "Collider"s Dave Trumbore gave the series' first episode a 4-star rating, feeling that the episode "[has] got a dark, yet darkly comic edge to the whole thing." The conservative evangelical Christian religious television network, called the Christian Broadcasting Network attacked the show, declaring it was part of a "witch agenda to make witchcraft look positive," an assessment that a writer for "The Mary Sue" called "hyperbolic," and stated that a "rebellious Latina witch" is, to those like CBN, "probably the scariest thing," while stating that the show sounds like "a ton of fun." 
Kevin Johnson of "The A.V. Club" was critical of the series, stating that they were not "buying the developments between Amity and Luz," but praised Eda's character. Ben Bertoli was more positive. He wrote that Terrace and those working on the job had done a great job creating a fantasy world, relatable characters, and predicted a "big animation fandom." Nick Venable wrote that fans of "Gravity Falls" and "Steven Universe" would love the series because the "otherworld-ness of the Boiling Isle[s] immediately asserts itself" while the show makes "relationships feel genuine and tactile," following in the footsteps of those shows. At the same time, Colin Hickson of Comic Book Resources praised the series, while noting that the opening of the series would give "any "Gravity Falls" fans a major sense of deja vu." Jade King of "TheGamer" described the show as a "groundbreaking queer adventure" that has broken boundaries in LGBTQ+ representation, noting how it builds off to "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power" and "Steven Universe". King also said that the show could make sure "queer content isn’t merely a footnote to the overall story" but ingrained into the show itself. The first season currently holds a rating of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes.

Samuel Cooper Thacher

Samuel Cooper Thacher (December 14, 1785 – January 2, 1818) was an American clergyman and librarian.
Thacher, who was born in Boston, on December 14, 1785, was sprung from a long line of preachers. His father Peter was the pastor of the Brattle Street Church in Boston, and his grandfathers were both ministers, including Peter Thacher, who in the beginning of the seventeenth century was a clergyman at Salisbury, England. It was not strange, that immediately after his graduation from Harvard College at the head of the class of 1804, he should have "all his hopes and wishes directed" to preparing himself for the ministry. He studied theology in Boston under Dr. Channing and then spent two years in Europe. Upon his return to the United States, he was in 1808 elected Harvard College librarian. This office he held for the term of three years.
At the inauguration of Harvard President John Thornton Kirkland on November 14, 1810, Thacher was appointed to deliver the Latin congratulatory address, a performance for which he received high praise. Not long after this event, Thacher was called to fill the pulpit of the New South Church in Boston, left vacant by Kirkland. His ordination took place May 15, 1811. He began his pastorate with enthusiasm and success, but before many years his health failed, and the remainder of his life was a brave but unavailing struggle against consumption. In August 1816, he sailed for England, hoping to benefit by the change. The first winter he passed at the dreary Cape of Good Hope, and the next fall he went to Moulins, France. Neither of these places helped him much, and at the latter he died, on January 2, 1818. There he was buried and over his grave is a monument bearing a Latin inscription by his friend and classmate Andrews Norton (Librarian, 1813–1821).
Thacher was elected a Fellow of the Harvard Corporation on February 19, 1816, but was present at only a few meetings before his departure for Europe. He was also a member of the American Academy. After his death his library, consisting of 676 lots, was sold at auction. By vote of the Harvard Corporation, the president was authorized to expend $50 at the sale on books for the college Library. Thacher wrote a number of articles for the Monthly Anthology, and published one sermon, preached at the dedication of the new church in 1814. His sermon on the Unity of God, in which he gives a clear exposition of the Unitarian doctrine, was printed in Liverpool in 1816 without his knowledge, and reprinted in Boston and also in Worcester the next year. In 1824, a volume of his sermons was issued, with a memoir by his successor at the New South church, the Rev. F. W. P. Greenwood.

Paula Nicho Cumez

Paula Nicho Cumez (born January 15, 1955) is a Mayan-Guatemalan artist. Cumez is inspired by Mayan tradition and culture and focuses on expressing the context of native women’s experience in her artwork; additionally, Cumez was inspired by the Popol Vuh. Cumez is known for creating an artist community of women within the Tz’uthil Mayan artists, named "Kaqchikel Surrealist Painters.” Additionally, a short film was made about Paula Nicho Cumez’s background called Del Azul al Cielo.
Biography &amp; Tz'utujil Foundations.
Paula is a self-proclaimed Mayan and Guatemalan artist who was a weaver before she became a painter, and whose influence stems from both her contemporary culture and ancestry. Through the encouragement of her grandfather Francisco Cumez (a sculptor himself) to develop her artistic skills and learning from her teacher and future-husband Salvador Cumez Currichich, she began her career at thirty years old in 1985. Paula Nicho Cumez is an artist from the town of San Juan Comalapa and is part of a greater Tz’utujil Mayan artist community. Cumez’s husband, Salvador Cumez Currichich, is also an artist from the same community. Another artist that is internationally known that is from this same town is Andrés Curruchich. Regardless, an interesting distinction between the male and female artists of this community that one should acknowledge is: that where male artists focus more on ritual processions, female artists focus on surrealism. Cumez identifies with her Maya Kaqchikel culture, and this is demonstrated through her various artworks. There are four cities which compose the Tz’utujil: (1) San Pedro de la Laguna, (2) Santiago Atitlán, (3) San Juan de la Laguna, and (4) San Juan de la Comalapa. However, the art from where Cumez’s was raised is in key ways different from the others, as this city is the only one that does not surround Lake Atitlán.
Artworks.
Cumez's work is attributed with surrealist artistic types, and many view her works as being reflective of "art naif" (native art). Many of her works are oil on canvas. One of her more prominent works is, "Processo y Visión de los Acuerdos de Paz" (2007) which depicts the goddess Ixchel and "El Principio de Una Nueva Era" (2012) which represents the end of the indigenous Baktun 5,125 cycle. Additionally, "Corazon del Maiz" (2004) is an oil on the wood painting which is cited in scholarly works. In the introduction section titled "Mayan Women as History," the artwork is used as a way to discuss a contemporary Central American exploited agricultural economy and how this affects working-class labour opportunities in third world countries. To see her works you can visit the following websites: 1 Arte Maya and Novica. Author and researcher Staikidis in regards to Cumez's work state, "the paintings become visual metaphorical windows into Mayan Kaqchikel female cultural worlds." Furthermore, this can be seen through artworks that carry these motifs such as, "Mi Segunda Piel" which is a series of two painting one made in 2002 and one made in 2004. 
The artworks reflect the narratives of Mayan-indigenous culture in Guatemala, and by creating narratives in the story there is a sense of individualized and embraced Tz’utujil Mayan identity. The use of weaving as a motif of female authorship and ownership is seen throughout the works: for example, the "Mother Nature" (1995) with the mountains substituted as guipils. The use of guipils and the acts of weaving relate to not only Cumez's upbringing but Mayan cosmology such as to Ixchel (which is also incorporated in her works). This indigenous clothing appears in works such as "Canto a La Naturaleza", "Nuestra Madre Tierra" as well as "Mi Segunda Piel."
Research.
Cumez has been cited in numerous scholarly articles which discuss the engendering of Latin American art history and has helped improve the visibility of the indigenous narratives at the undercurrent of many Central-American countries. For example, working with Dr Kryssi Staikidis of Northern Illinois University, Cumez is aiding in research of indigenous mentorship-models in aims of restructuring the way in which art is taught today. Additionally, through research, Cumez has, to an extent, both aided in the broadening of European-centered art history as well as stressed the importance of indigenous Mayan art-history. Cumez has worked with professors and students to help them rethink the way in which art is created and utilized as a form of liberation; she helps people acknowledge how in some cases art can bridge groups together, as seen through her ability to mentor others outside of her own culture through indigenous-centred art. Cumez is also profiled in a scholarly book that discusses implementing art and social justice education into the classroom and has a chapter devoted to her own work, which relates her subject matter to the realities of immigration. An example of such artworks that discuss these realities can be seen in Cumez's "Crossing Borders".

The Lost Mile is the seventh studio album by Vertical Horizon. The album was released exclusively on digital platforms on February 23, 2018. It was released by Outfall Records, the independent label headed by frontman Matt Scannell.
Background and recording.
In an interview with Billboard Magazine, Scannell describes "The Lost Mile" as "the most indulgent album I've ever made." The album marks somewhat of a departure from the band's established sound, both in terms of its focus on keyboards and in relation to the length of the songs - of which only one runs for less than four minutes. Scannell cited bands such as Depeche Mode, The Cure and New Order as influences, as well as the Cormac McCarthy novel "No Country for Old Men". The album features a re-recording of "I'm Not Running," a song that was originally co-written and performed with American singer-songwriter Richard Marx. Marx provides backing vocals on the studio version of the song. The first single, "I'm Gonna Save You," was released on February 14.

Eucalyptus County Park

Eucalyptus County Park is a urban park located at 9125 Edgewood Drive in Spring Valley, California, United States.
Named for the many eucalyptus trees on the property, the park frequently hosts birthday parties, horseshoes tournaments, BBQ grills, neighborhood children, dogs on leash, birdwatchers, a pair of hawks, and, often, artists painting the park itself. Eucalyptus County Park is managed and maintained by the Parks and Recreation Department of the County of San Diego. The park's site is one of the oldest in the eastern San Diego County dedicated to public recreational use.
Amenities.
In addition to 6 acres of open space areas, natural vegetation zones, green belts, gardens, and walking paths, it contains restrooms, two children's playgrounds, and the upper-level cement party area (aka Volunteer Area) under pepper trees and black oaks. Additionally, a small runoff/streambed runs southward, along the western portion of the park, en route to the Sweetwater River Spring Valley watershed. Because this park is on the side of a hill, there is limited ADA access.
History.
The eucalyptus trees were planted in 1880 by Charles S. Crosby, an early settler to the area. Bringing seeds from Australia with the intention of planting them as a source of railroad ties, Crosby transplanted a portion of the seedlings he had grown to a picnic area known as the Grove, which ultimately became the heart of the present-day park. Whenever a eucalyptus planted by Crosby in the park dies, it is replaced with a new eucalyptus sapling by the Parks and Recreation Department. Eight such saplings are growing in the park.
The property, afterwards owned by the local businessman Walter S. Lieber, was donated by him "to the County of San Diego ... for the inspiration and pleasure of the people" in 1929 (according to the monument in the center of the park). It is possible that Lieber's donation of this property for the use of the community was due to his admiration of Ellen Browning Scripps's many donations of parklands throughout San Diego County.
The park, placed in reserve in 1929, was dedicated on July 4, 1930, with a community parade, a party with games, picnics, a circus, fireworks and remarks by George Marston, who "expressed trees' importance to society".
Subsequently, the home on the upper lot was removed from the property due to safety issues, but the two original rock staircases and the set of hewn log stairs continues to be maintained.

Description from Seitz.
In ab. icadius [of "icarus"] Gr.-Grsh. (80 g) which occurs particularly in Anterior Asia, the borders of the ocelli are almost of the same colour as the ground and therefore scarcely visible, being much too distinct in our figure. The hindwing, moreover, has a slightly different shape in this form, which is perhaps on the way to develop into a local race.

Rudin's conjecture is a mathematical hypothesis (in additive combinatorics and elementary number theory) concerning an upper bound for the number of squares in finite arithmetic progressions. The conjecture, which has applications in the theory of trigonometric series, was first stated by Walter Rudin in his 1960 paper "Trigonometric series with gaps".
For positive integers formula_1 define the expression formula_2 to be the number of perfect squares in the arithmetic progression formula_3, for formula_4, and define formula_5 to be the maximum of the set . Rudin's conjecture asserts (in big O notation) that formula_6 and in its stronger form that, if formula_7, formula_8.

Jessica Hellmann

Jessica Hellmann is a Professor of Ecology and the director of the Institute on the Environment at the University of Minnesota. She is recognized as "one of the nation’s leading researchers on global change ecology and climate adaptation". Hellmann was one of the first to identify that living with climate change is "just as crucial to the future of humanity and Earth’s ecosystems as slowing and stopping greenhouse gas emissions". Her lab uses mathematical models, genomic techniques to identify the impact of climate change on ecology and evolution. Jessica Hellmann also has a spouse, Larry LaTarte (47) and one daughter, Ada LaTarte (14).
Early life and education.
Hellmann is originally from Indiana and Detroit, Michigan.
Hellmann has said she chose a career in ecology after being inspired by space camp, her grandfather's farm and her father who worked as a mechanical engineer at General Motors. She completed a Bachelor's in Ecology at the University of Michigan in 1996. She holds a PhD in Biology from Stanford. Her doctoral advisor, and role model, was Paul R. Ehrlich. She was a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for International Security and Cooperation, where she argued that the environment was an important part of security. At Stanford University, she was part of the "Leopold Leadership Program". Hellmann also worked as a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Zoology at the University of British Columbia.
Career.
Hellmann joined the University of Notre Dame in 2003, where she served as a faculty member in the Department of Biological Sciences. She received a Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation in 2006. She researched the impact of habitat loss and fragmentation on the distribution of insects and their host plants. She concentrated on the Garry oak species, and how they could spread in a future climate. She founded Notre Dame's undergraduate minor is sustainability.
In 2011 she was awarded a Residential Fellowship from the University of Notre Dame Institute for Advanced Study. In 2012,she published the book "Advancing Adaptation In the City of Chicago". She delivered the 2012 Reilly Forum Lecture, "Fixing the global commons: what humans can and should do to help nature live and thrive through climate change". In 2013, Hellmann helped the Global Adaptation Institute relocate in the University of Notre Dame. In 2015, she became Research Director of the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (ND-GAIN), which measures climate risks and readiness to adapt to climate risks for countries around the world. She was worried about being labelled a "butterfly person", as she studied them extensively as proxy for how climate change impacts insects in general. She was described as an "influential voice surrounding climate adaptation and the environment".
In 2015, Hellmann joined the University of Minnesota as the director of the Institute on the Environment., where she delivered a keynote talk, "Can we save biodiversity from climate change?" She is also the Russell M. and Elizabeth M. Bennett Chair in Excellence in the University's Department of Ecology, Evolution and Behavior. She published her second book, "A Review Of The Landscape Conservation Cooperatives" in 2016. She is co-chair of the University of Minnesota Water Council. She continues to collaborate with ND-GAIN as a core research member and mentors other ND-GAIN researchers.
She has influenced governments and corporations, encouraging them to strategically invest in climate change adaptation. In 2013 and 2014 she co-wrote the National Climate Change Assessment. She is on the Board of Directors of the Great Plains Institute, the Science Advisory Council for the Environmental Law and Policy Center and the governing committee of the Natural Capital Planet. She has contributed to CNN, NPR, Fox News, "The Telegraph" and the "Chicago Tribune." She writes for The Conversation (website). In 2017 she was announced as an American Association for the Advancement of Science Leshner Fellow.
Hellman regularly contributes to the following scientific journals: "Proceedings of the National Academies of Science, Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment, BioScience" and "PLOS ONE." She serves on the editorial board of the journal "Evolutionary Applications" and is an associate editor with both "Conservation Biology" and "Elementa."

2018 Arena Football League season

The 2018 Arena Football League season was the 31st season in the history of the Arena Football League (AFL). Prior to the start of the season, the league contracted from five to four teams with one team folding, one going on hiatus, and one added expansion team. The 12-game regular season began on April 13 and ended on July 7.
League business.
League organization changes.
The offseason was marked by uncertainty until the AFL and Arena Football League Players' Union reached a new deal on a four-year collective bargaining agreement (CBA), nearly doubling player compensation and expanding health insurance benefits, replacing the previous CBA, which had expired after the 2017 season. The deal was finally reached amid rumors that the season and league's existence were in jeopardy when the two sides were failing to negotiate through several proposals and supposed ultimatums.
On March 27, 2018, the AFL announced commissioner Scott Butera would be replaced by Randall Boe. During Butera's three seasons as commissioner, the league had decreased from 14 members in the 2014 season to four for the 2018 season.
Teams.
On August 23, 2017, the week of ArenaBowl XXX, multiple sources revealed that the AFL planned to expand to Albany, New York, and Newark, New Jersey, for 2018. The Albany Empire was confirmed October 24, with the team owned by Hearst Communications executive George Randolph Hearst III and sharing non-football management with the Philadelphia Soul.
On November 28, the Cleveland Gladiators announced that they would have to take a two-year leave of absence while their arena, shared with its primary tenant the NBA's Cleveland Cavaliers, undergoes construction during the basketball offseason. The next month, the longest-tenured AFL team, with franchise roots to the inaugural AFL season, the Tampa Bay Storm, also suspended operations citing higher operating costs combined with lower revenues, but did not rule out returning in the future.
In February 2018, the 2018 season schedule was finalized with only the returning Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Washington teams and the expansion Albany team, but no Newark team, matching the size of the league in the original "demonstration season" in 1987.
Schedule and playoff changes.
The 2018 season consisted of a 13-week schedule during which each team played 12 games and had one bye week. With only four participating members for the season, the schedule for each team decreased by two games, continuing the trend of shortened seasons since the 2015 season. All teams played each opponent four times. Expansion Albany played seven home games, Baltimore and Washington six, and defending champion Philadelphia had only five.
At the end of the regular season, all teams participated in the ArenaBowl playoffs, in which the top seed faced the 4th seed while the 2nd seed faced the 3rd seed in a home and home series. The team in each series with the highest aggregate score advanced to the ArenaBowl. If the aggregate score in either series had been tied after the second game in the home-and-home semifinals, the game would have continued in the AFL's standard overtime format; this was not necessitated. While the semifinals consisted of two games in each pairing, ArenaBowl XXXI was still only one game.
With one week remaining in the 2018 regular season and a then three-way tie for first, the league announced the ArenaBowl would be hosted by the semifinal winner with the higher average attendance through the season instead of using any tiebreakers or home field advantage based on records. However, once the semifinals were completed, the higher-seeded Baltimore Brigade, not the higher-attended Washington Valor, would host ArenaBowl XXXI as the Valor's home field, Capital One Arena, had already scheduled summer renovations to begin at that time.

LeMoyne Normal Institute

LeMoyne Normal Institute was a school for African Americans in Memphis, Tennessee. Alumni include Bert M. Roddy. It was a predecessor to LeMoyne-Owen College.
LeMoyne Normal and Commercial School was founded in 1862 when the American Missionary Association (AMA) sent Lucinda Humphrey to open an elementary school at Camp Shiloh (Tennessee) for free blacks and escaped slaves. This was one of more than ten schools founded by the AMA, an integrated organization led by black and white Congregational, Methodist and Presbyterian ministers. In 1909 it was located at 240 South Orleans.
The school was established soon after the occupation of Memphis by Federal troops during the Civil War. The soldiers were based at Camp Shiloh to the south of the city limits. First known as Lincoln Chapel, the school was relocated into Memphis proper in 1863. In 1866 it was destroyed during the 1866 riots by white residents of Memphis that broke out following the withdrawal of federal troops. The school was rebuilt and reopened in 1867 with 150 students and six teachers. 
In 1870, Francis Julius LeMoyne (1798-1879), a Washington, Pennsylvania doctor, donated $20,000 to the American Missionary Association to build an elementary and secondary school for prospective teachers. LeMoyne, who was a notable abolitionist, traveled from his Pennsylvania home to visit the new school. He donated a clock for the school's tower.
Following a yellow fever epidemic in 1873 that hit Memphis and the school hard, its third principal, Andrew J. Steele, oversaw three decades of growth and development. 
In 1914 the school moved from Orleans Street to its present site on Walker Avenue. Steele Hall, the first building on the new campus, was erected that same year. LeMoyne became a junior college in 1924. After developing a four-year curriculum, it became a four-year college in 1930.

Hijas de Cuauhtemoc

Hijas de Cuauhtemoc was a revolutionary feminist organization founded in Mexico City during the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). The organization was opposed to the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz and the imperialist economic policies during this period, which they felt exploited workers. Hijas de Cuauhtemoc engaged in many forms of activism to promote the removal of Diaz from power. As a feminist organization, Hijas de Cuauhtemoc also sought to connect revolutionary struggle to radical social changes for Mexican women. Specifically, the feminist demands of Hijas de Cuauhtemoc were the abolition of domestic labor, equal pay, educational access, equal rights within the family, and rights for women in agricultural work.
Origins.
The revolutionary ideologies dedicated to the overthrow of Porfirio Diaz were often detailed in newspapers written by revolutionary journalists who sometimes wrote under pseudonyms. Many of these journalists were women who incorporated feminist ideals into their revolutionary rhetoric. Included in these feminist revolutionary journalists were Juana Gutierrez, Dolores Jimenez y Muro, Elisa Acufia y Rosette, and Ines Malvaez.
Juana Gutierrez, Dolores Jimenez y Muro, Elisa Acufia y Rosette, and Ines Malvaez were eventually jailed by the Porfiriato for their revolutionary writings and activism. It was during their time in jail that these feminists joined together united by their similar beliefs and passion for activism and founded Hijas de Cuauhtemoc.
Activism.
The activism of Hijas de Cuauhtemoc took many forms.
The organization was known for collecting 1,000 signatures that called for Porfirio Diaz to step down and for the Mexican government to hold a truly free election.
They are also known to have been a part of a peaceful demonstration during which protesters placed flowers on the graves of those who had died during the often violent revolutionary struggle for independence. Many of these peaceful protesters were arrested

Van made his professional debut for the Ottawa Redblacks, where he won a Grey Cup in 2016. He has also been a member of the Edmonton Eskimos and BC Lions.
Professional career.
Ottawa Redblacks.
After going undrafted in the 2015 NFL Draft Van signed with the Ottawa Redblacks (CFL) on August 10, 2015 to replace Chevon Walker. Van did not see any playing time in 2015, but in 2016 he came into prominence in the Redblacks offense after starting running back William Powell tore his Achilles tendon in preseason. The Redblack employed a running back by committee approach in 2016, which included Mossis Madu (106 touches), Travon Van (100), Nic Grigsby (73), and Kienan LaFrance (49). Van carried the ball 81 times in 2017, for 422 yards with three touchdowns. He also caught 19 passes for 137 yards. Following the season he was not re-signed by the Redblacks and became a free agent. 
Edmonton Eskimos.
On February 16, 2017, Van signed with the Edmonton Eskimos. Van was slated to become the team's backup running back to John White. Two weeks into the 2017 season, White suffered a season-ending injury, meaning Van was the new starter for the Eskimos. Van would play his former team, the Redblacks, on July 14. He would record his first 100+ yard rushing game, finishing the game with 18 carries for 103 yards. However, two weeks later Van would suffer a neck injury during a game against the BC Lions. He would be placed on the six-game injured list. He returned on September 16 against the Toronto Argonauts. Van would go on to record 18 carries for 76 yards and a touchdown before suffering a season-ending injury on September 30 versus the Winnipeg Blue Bombers. He appeared in six games in 2017, rushing for 283 yards and three touchdowns.
On February 16, 2018, the Eskimos re-signed Van to a one-year contract. Nevertheless, Van was released by the Eskimos on May 1, 2018, as the team trimmed their roster down to 75 players in preparation for the 2018 season.
BC Lions.
On May 10, 2018, Van signed with the BC Lions. Van was released by the Lions on October 9, 2018, shortly following the acquisition of Tyrell Sutton. Van played in thee games for the Lions in the 2018 season, rushing 10 times for 43 yards with one touchdown. He also caught four passes for 41 yards. 
Toronto Argonauts.
One week after being released by the Lions Van signed with the Toronto Argonauts on October 16, 2018.

Owen Connellan (politician)

Owen Connellan (1856 – 8 September 1923) was a British politician and trade unionist.
Born in Bristol, Connellan became a compositor and joined the Typographical Association (TA). At aged 13, while working as a printer, he was convicted for theft for stealing 16 shillings, 3 pence from James Allen Francis in Penzance, Cornwall. He was sent Kingswood Reformatory near Bristol for five years.
He moved to Bradford, where in 1880 he became active in the local branch of the TA, and from 1886 to 1888 he was the union's national president. While in Bradford, he led a dispute between the union and the "Bradford Observer" relating to union recognition and the introduction of new technologies.
Connellan moved to Leeds in the early 1890s, and in 1892 he was elected as secretary of Leeds Trades Council. The following year, he was an early member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), despite not being a socialist. He did not remain in the new party for long, and in 1895 he was elected to Leeds City Council in the East Ward as a Liberal-Labour politician, with the support of the Leeds Electoral Association and the local branch of the Irish National Federation. He hoped to stand in Leeds East in the 1900 UK general election, but was unable to attract the backing of the trades council, and the recently-founded Labour Representation Committee (LRC) instead backed William Pollard Byles. Upset by this development, Connellan instead supported J. R. Maguire of the Liberal Party. He resigned as secretary of the trades council, although ultimately he was persuaded to remain in the post.
Against Connellan's wishes, the trades council affiliated to the LRC, and in 1901 he served as its delegate to the committee. He was elected to its National Executive Committee as its first trades council representative. This experience moved him towards a split from the Liberal Party and, though he was re-elected to the council as a Lib-Lab in 1903, in 1904 he decided that he would in future contest elections for Labour. He attempted to become the party's candidate for Leeds East at the 1906 UK general election, but his recent conversion to Labour did not impress the local party, which instead backed ILP member James O'Grady.
Although now less influential in local politics, Connellan remained active. In 1904, the Trades Union Congress was held in Leeds, and Connellan served as chair of the reception committee. He resigned his council seat that year, but won in New Wortley in 1906, serving until 1912, then back in the East ward from 1914. At the 1922 UK general election, he unsuccessfully contested Buckingham for the Labour Party.

Wood B. Kyle

Wood Barbee Kyle (March 3, 1915 – October 25, 2000) was a highly decorated officer of the United States Marine Corps with the rank of major general. Kyle received two Silver Stars for gallantry in action during Pacific Campaign in World War II. He later took part in the Vietnam War and distinguished himself as commanding general of the 3rd Marine Division.
Early years.
Kyle was born on March 3, 1915, in Pecos, Texas, and grew up in Hillsboro, where he attended a local high school. Upon his graduation in the summer of 1932, Kyle went to College Station, where he attended Texas A&amp;M University. While at university, he was a member of ROTC unit and following his graduation in June 1936 with a bachelor's degree, Kyle was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Reserve.
However, Kyle resigned his U.S. Army commission; in order to accept appointment as a second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on July 11, 1936. He was subsequently ordered to the Basic School at Philadelphia Navy Yard for his basic officers' training and graduated in April of the following year. He was in the same class as another future general, Lewis W. Walt.
Kyle was subsequently ordered to attached to San Diego, California, and appointed platoon leader in the 6th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Brigade. He embarked for China in October 1937 and later took part in the guard duties at the International Settlement of Shanghai. His unit was ordered back to the States in April 1938 and subsequently served at Marine Corps Base San Diego until May 1940. Meanwhile, Kyle was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant in July 1939. He then served with the Marine detachment aboard the aircraft carrier USS "Lexington" and took part in the patrol cruises off the coast of Hawaii.
World War II.
With the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Kyle was promoted to the temporary rank of captain and ordered to San Diego, where he was appointed company commander within 1st Battalion, 2nd Marines under Colonel John M. Arthur. The 2nd Marines were tasked with the training of new recruits, before they were ordered to Koro Island in July 1942. Kyle was promoted to the rank of major during the following month and appointed executive officer of 1st Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert E. Hill.
During the Guadalcanal Campaign, 1st Battalion landed on the island at the beginning of October 1942 and immediately took part in the actions against Japanese units. On November 10, Lt. Col. Hill was severely wounded by enemy artillery fire in Matanikau sector and was evacuated from the island. Kyle assumed command of the battalion and although he was wounded, he refused to be evacuated and remained with his troops. He successfully drove through relentless Japanese resistance to capture his objective. In the final assault launched in the same area, Major Kyle further distinguished himself when, by his dauntless courage and expert professional ability, he completed his assigned mission within four hours of its initiation. He was decorated with the Silver Star for his gallantry in action and the Purple Heart for his wounds.
Kyle remained with 1st Battalion at Guadalcanal until the end of January 1943 and subsequently was ordered to Wellington, New Zealand. He was appointed permanent commanding officer of 1st Battalion and spent following several months with training and reorganization for upcoming combat deployment – Tarawa.
The first battalion was designated regimental reserve, but casualties were so high, that Colonel David M. Shoup ordered Kyle and his unit ashore during the first hours of the landing. Major Kyle immediately directed his companies’ in the bitter assault against a fanatic enemy and despite the extreme danger, personally commanded his men in brilliantly executed attacks against the heavily defended central sector of the island. Assuming control of the remnants of one of the battalions of his regiment the following day, he promptly reorganized the unit for further sustained operations against the strongly entrenched Japanese.
Kyle received his second Silver Star for his actions on Tarawa and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in December 1943.

Decorations.
A complete list of Kyle's medals and decorations include:
First Silver Star citation.
Citation:
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Silver Star to Major Wood Barbee Kyle (MCSN: 0-5369), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity while serving as Executive Officer of the First Battalion, Second Marines, Reinforced, in action against enemy Japanese forces in the Matanikau River Sector, Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, from 1 November 1942 to 14 January 1943. Refusing to be evacuated when he was wounded in action during the vital offensive operations of his battalion, Major Kyle assumed command of the battalion after the commanding officer had been forced to withdraw as a result of serious wounds, and with keen initiative and aggressive leadership successfully drove through relentless Japanese resistance to capture his objective. In the final assault launched in the same area, Major Kyle further distinguished himself when, by his dauntless courage and expert professional ability, he completed his assigned mission within four hours of its initiation. His exemplary conduct and unswerving devotion to duty throughout the entire active period were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
Second Silver Star citation.
Citation:
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Silver Star to Major Wood Barbee Kyle (MCSN: 0-5369), United States Marine Corps, for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as Commanding Officer of the First Battalion, Second Marines, SECOND Marine Division, during action against enemy Japanese forces at Tarawa, Gilbert Islands, from 20 to 24 November 1943. Landing with his troops during the initial stages of the fierce hostilities on D-Day, Major Kyle immediately directed his companies in the bitter assault against a fanatic enemy and, despite the extreme danger, personally commanded his men in brilliantly executed attacks against the heavily defended central sector of the island. Assuming control of the remnants of one of the battalions of his regiment the following day, he promptly reorganized the unit for further sustained operations against the strongly entrenched Japanese. By his forceful and inspiring leadership, his daring combat tactics and cool and courageous action in the face of grave peril, Major Kyle contributed materially to the success of our forces in capturing this vital hostile stronghold and his zealous devotion to duty throughout was in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Mirabello Castle

The Mirabello Castle is located in Mirabello di Pavia in the area of the Parco Visconteo. The building today is only a wing of the original castle, which was the seat of the Captain of the Park, the authority administering the Parco Visconteo on behalf of the Visconti family.
History.
Since the 12th century the area had been occupied by a Cistercians monastery. In 1325 the Fiamberti family of Pavia acquired goods and lands in the area and between 1325 and 1341 they built the original castle. In the sixties of the fourteenth century, Galeazzo II Visconti acquired the castle from the Fiamberti.
The castle was completed by the Visconti family and incorporated in the Parco Visconteo.

Burt Distillery

Burt Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery which operated in Burt, County Donegal, Ireland between 1814 and 1841. 
Though of little importance in the context of the Irish whiskey industry, the distillery is remarkable for having existing for over a quarter of a century in an area notorious for the production of poitín, an illicit spirit.
History.
In 1814, William Leathem established a small distillery at Bohillion, just outside Burt, Co. Donegal. The distillery, though not large, was notable for being the only licensed distillery to have operated with any degree of success in Donegal, an area renowned for the production of Poitín, an illicit spirit. To differentiate his product from the Poitín produced by the illicit stills, Leathem produced a high quality whiskey from grain, which was aged for a least a year. This contrasted with the local Poitín, which although of good quality, was generally produced from a mix of barley and molasses and sold within a few weeks of being distilled. In addition, Leathem developed an export trade with England. 
The precise history of the distillery is difficult to piece together. However, records show that in 1821, the distillery was operating a 49 gallon still, and that output in 1828, reached 53,873 gallons of proof spirit.
In 1834, Leathem gave important first-hand testimony before a Government inquiry on illicit distilling practices. In his testimony, Leathem was very critical of the excise administration, in particular, on their practice of posting incompetent English officers to Ireland. 
Although Burt Distillery had initially succeeded in competing against its illicit rivals, by the 1830s, it also faced competition from two large scale legal distilleries which had emerged in nearby Derry. As a small scale operation without economies of scale, it appears that Burt Distillery could not compete on both fronts, and the distillery closed in 1841.
It is not known what happened to the distilling equipment. However, the distillery buildings themselves were retained in use well into the 20th Century. One of the distillery buildings, is still extant, and is currently used as a farmyard building. With a prominent chimney, it can be seen by passing motorists on the N13 from Derry to Letterkenny, a silent reminder of Burt’s distilling heritage.

Afghanistan–France relations

Afghanistan–France relations refers to the diplomatic relations between Afghanistan and France. Both nations are members of the United Nations.
History.
Afghanistan and France established diplomatic relations in 1922. In 1923, France opened a diplomatic legation in Kabul as well as an office for the French Archaeological Delegation in Afghanistan (DAFA). Initially, relations between both nations were underdeveloped. In 1928, Afghan King Amanullah Khan paid an official visit to France.
In January 1943, during World War II, France closed its diplomatic legation in Kabul. As a result, Afghanistan closed its diplomatic legation in Paris in 1944 when Vichy France declined Afghanistan's diplomatic legation dual accreditation to France and Switzerland. Soon after the war, both nations re-opened their legations and upgraded them to embassies in 1949.
In 1965, Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah paid an official visit to France and met with President Charles de Gaulle. In 1968, French Prime Minister Georges Pompidou paid an official visit to Afghanistan. 
In 1979, the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan starting the Soviet–Afghan War. For the next 25 years, relations between both nations became nearly nonexistent. After the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan, the French government announced in January 1990 that it would reopen its embassy in Kabul. Years later the Civil War and Taliban stopped relations once again. 
Since the NATO led War in Afghanistan, France has participated in multiple military excursions and battles throughout the country. In 2002, France re-established diplomatic relations with the Afghan government under President Hamid Karzai. Under the International Security Assistance Force, France has played a leading role of providing security within the North-East part of Afghanistan, especially in the Kapisa Province.
In August 2021, France closed its embassy in Kabul due to the return of the Taliban in power. Afghanistan has an embassy in Paris.
High-level visits.

Bilateral relations.
Throughout the years, both nations have signed numerous bilateral agreements such as an Agreement of Cooperation between the University of Paris and Kabul University (1960); Agreement on Health Cooperation (1963); Cultural and Technical Cooperation (1966); Agreement on Agriculture Cooperation (1969) and a Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (2012).
Trade.
In 2015, trade between Afghanistan and France totaled €27.8 million Euros. France's three main exports to Afghanistan are agricultural products, pharmaceuticals, rubber and plastic products.

Canada at the 2020 Summer Olympics

Canada competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the Games were postponed to 23 July to 8 August 2021, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the nation's debut in 1900, Canadian athletes have appeared in every edition of the Summer Olympic Games, with the exception of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the country's support for United States-led boycott.
Before the official postponement, the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee initially announced their intention not to send teams to both the Olympics and Paralympics. Following the announcement on the postponement, the COC and CPC issued a statement that says, in part, that Team Canada "will rise to the challenge to showcase our very best on the international stage," without explicitly saying that Canadian athletes will take part in the games.
As part of the Canada Day celebrations held on Parliament Hill, Ottawa in 2019, former three time Olympic gold medalist in rowing, Marnie McBean was named as the Chef De Mission for the team.
On July 13, 2021, the Canadian Olympic Committee officially announced the full team of 370 athletes (145 men and 225 women) competing in 30 sports, the largest team the country has sent to the games since Los Angeles 1984 and an increase of 56 from Rio 2016. 131 coaches will also accompany the team. A total of eight squads qualified in team sports, tied for the most ever with Montreal 1976. A total of 227 athletes competed at their first Olympics, and 134 of them returned from Rio 2016. On July 15, 2021, Vasek Pospisil withdrew from the tennis competitions, which reduced the team size to 370. On July 24, Annie Guglia received a reallocated spot in the women's street skateboarding event after an injury to a competitor from South Africa. This increased the team back to 371 athletes (145 men and 226 women).
Due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the International Olympic Committee announced in July 2021, that travelling alternates would be allowed to compete in the following team sports: field hockey, football (soccer), handball, rugby sevens and water polo. The alternates for these team sports are listed below and consisted of a further nine athletes (two in field hockey, four in soccer, one per rugby sevens and water polo teams). However, these nine do not officially count towards the team size. Canada's Olympic team will contest all sports on the Olympic program except handball, modern pentathlon and surfing. Alternates in soccer, rugby sevens and water polo competed, and are refelected in the table below. This increased the team size to 378. Two athletes in fencing and one in triathlon was added during the competition due to injury replacements. This meant the final team size was 381 athletes (148 men and 233 women).
On July 19, 2021, basketball player Miranda Ayim and rugby sevens athlete Nathan Hirayama were named as co-flagbearers for the Parade of Nations during the opening ceremony. On August 8, 2021, gold medalist and Olympic record holder in the decathlon, Damian Warner was named as the flagbearer during the closing ceremony.
The 24 medals won at the 2020 Summer Olympics mark the country's best-ever total medals result after the 1984 Games, surpassing the 22 medals won in 1996 and 2016, while also equalling the most number of gold medals won in 1992. At the 1984 Summer Olympics, which were boycotted by the Soviet Bloc, Canada won 44 medals.

Thomas Staniforth (priest)

Thomas Staniforth (1807–1887) was an English clergyman who resided at Storrs Hall, Windermere, England. He is notable as the first crew captain for Oxford at The Boat Race 1829.
Early life.
Thomas Staniforth was the son of Samuel Staniforth and Mary Littledale, and the grandson of Thomas Staniforth, another former Lord Mayor of Liverpool, descended from the Staniforths of Darnall Hall. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, matriculating in 1826 and graduating B.A. in 1830. He captained the first Oxford crew at The Boat Race 1829, a team that included Charles Wordsworth, Thomas Garnier amongst others.
Career.
During his working life, Staniforth was a rector at Bolton-by-Bowland in Lancashire between the years 1831–1859.
Staniforth retired and moved into Storrs Hall at Windermere in 1859, after it was passed down to him by his godfather John Bolton. He remained there until his death in 1887. He never had any children and the property was sold. In his will he left a large sum of money to his grand-nephew Edwin Wilfred Greenwood, the son of politician John Greenwood.

North of the Border (film)

North of the Border is a 1946 American western film.
The movie was directed by B. Reeves Eason and based on a story by James Oliver Curwood. Many of the same cast and crew also worked on "'Neath Canadian Skies".
Although the film credits James Curwood, TCM states that "the film does not appear to have been based on one of his stories."
Synopsis.
American rancher "Utah" Nyes (Hayden) comes to Canada to meet his partner, Bill Lawton. He finds that Lawton has been murdered by a gang led by "Nails" Nelson (Fowley). With the help of Mountie Jack Craig (Talbot), and fur-trapper Ivy Jenkins (Jolley), "Utah" manages to clear himself of the murder of Lawton, and also to break up Nelson's gang.

Joseph Scott Fullerton

Joseph Scott Fullerton (December 3, 1835 – March 20, 1897) was an American lawyer, officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War, and a leader for a short time at the Freedmen's Bureau during the Reconstruction Era. In his later years he was a National military park manager and real estate developer..
Life and career.
Fullerton was born in December 1835 in Chillicothe, Ohio to Elizabeth Thompson "née" Scott and Humphrey Fullerton Jr. The Fullerton family had been patriots in the American Revolution and had large landholdings in Pennsylvania near Lancaster. He was educated at Chillicothe Academy and then enrolled in Miami University where he graduated in 1856. He graduated from Cincinnati Law School in 1858 and for a while worked in the office of a Chillicothe attorney before settling in St. Louis, Missouri where he continued to practice law.
During the Civil War he was given the rank of Brevet Brigadier General after refusing an appointment as major citing his lack of experience, enlisting as a private, and quickly receiving an appointment as a 1st Lieutenant. He was part of the 2nd Missouri Infantry. He rose to be Assistant Adjutant General with the rank of Major on the staff of General Gordon Granger and was also Lieutenant Colonel, A.A.G. and Chief of Staff of the 4th Army Corps, Army of the Cumberland. Fullerton was brevetted Brigadier General March 13, 1865 for his service during the Atlanta Campaign.
Fullerton helped organize and lead the Freedmen Bureau but he did not stay in that role for long. President Andrew Johnson sent him to help settle strifle in New Orleans between free Blacks, "colored" veterans, and white supremacists after riots in 1866.
On his return to St. Louis in 1867, Fullerton became the Postmaster General of the city. He acquired large tracts of land in suburban St. Louis and as a real estate developer was the driving force behind the housing developments in Westminster Place and Portland and Westmoreland Places. In the 1890s he was also Chairman of the Chickamauga &amp; Chattanooga National Military Park.
Fullerton died in a railroad accident on March 20, 1897 near Oakland, Maryland. The train on which he was riding jumped the tracks while crossing a bridge over the Youghiogheny River. His carriage fell into the river and broke in two. His body was carried downstream and was not found for three weeks. He was the only fatality in the accident. Fullerton was buried at Grandview Cemetery in Chillicothe in a funeral attended by many dignitaries from Washington, including General Stanley under whom he had served in the Civil War.

Disability in Zambia

People with disability in Zambia face many unique challenges. The country has been passing laws and policies to help people with disabilities in Zambia, however, social stigma and other factors sometimes interfere in people being able to access services and assistance. In addition, the HIV epidemic in Zambia also has a significant impact on the lives of people with disabilities.
Demographics.
As of 2008, it was estimated that around 256,000 in Zambia have a disability in some form and around 5.4% of that number have an intellectual disability. In 2011, it was estimated that the numbers may actually be somewhere between 1 and 2 million people with disability in Zambia. Sixty percent of Zambians live in rural areas where they have limited access to healthcare. People with disabilities have an employment rate of 45.5%, which is lower than the 58% rate for people without disabilities, according to 2005 statistics.
Care-giving roles for people with disabilities in Zambia has shifted to a younger demographic than in previous years. This is in part due to the drop in life expectancy in Zambia.
Cultural attitudes towards disability.
In general, people with disability often face social stigma in Zambia. Zambian people with disability can be thought to be the victims of witchcraft by others. Modern Zambian religious beliefs have come to accept and embrace individuals with disabilities over time. Some Zambians attribute a shift to Christianity to the new, more positive, views on people with disability in Zambia. In the workplace, individuals still face discrimination.
Relatives are expected to care for individuals who have a disability. However, there are boarding schools for children with disabilities, and these are often utilized when the children had been orphaned or abandoned. People with disabilities and who are also HIV positive are further marginalized by their communities. People with disability are often expected to rely on charity.
People with disabilities, especially women and those who are HIV positive are assumed to have no sexuality or sex lives by others in Zambia. Disabled women attempting to access health care are often discouraged from visiting health centres, especially for sexual and maternal health needs.
Policy.
Disability issues in Zambia fall under the control of the Ministry of Community Development and Social Welfare, now known as the Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health (MCDMCH). However, overall, there is a lack of government support for individuals with disabilities. Individuals who have an intellectual disability cannot receive social welfare benefits. A trust fund, managed by the Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities, give out funds to mostly individuals with physical disabilities.
Zambia's Fifth National Development Plan has made some progress in helping people with disabilities in Zambia achieve equal status.
Infrastructure.
Laws requiring ramps for schools and public buildings were passed in 2012. However, many of the ramps that have been built are not suitable for people with physical disabilities. The largest museum in Zambia, the Livingstone Museum, installed a ramp and other accessibility features in 2006.
Education.
The Ministry of Education in Zambia handles special education in the schools. The Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training Authority (TEVETA) is also involved in both education and employment. People with disabilities in Zambia experience difficulty accessing educational opportunities. Special education services have been very limited in Zambia. Parents of children with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Lusaka reported that there were challenges to meeting the social needs of their young adult children.
Non Governmental Organisations.
The first organisation focusing on helping people with disabilities, The Northern Rhodesia Society for the Blind, was formed in 1952.
The Zambia Association for Children and Adults with Learning Disabilities (ZACALD) is one of the most prominent organisations to advocate for individuals with intellectual disabilities in Zambia. The Zambia Agency for Persons with Disabilities (ZAPD) works with the government to advise on policy and advocate for people with disabilities. In addition, the Zambia Federation of Disability Organisations (ZAFOD) has been cited by the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa (OSISA) as an active and influential organisation in Zambia. ZAFOD advocates for disability rights and promotes teaching issues relating to people with disabilities in tertiary schools in the country.
Legislation.
In 1996, the Zambian government passed the Disability Act of 1996. This act bans discrimination based on disability. This act was repealed in 2012 and replaced with the Persons with Disability Act of 2012. The new act is meant to implement the UN Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
In 1998, the Technical Education, Vocational and Entrepreneurship Training (TEVET) Act was passed and a provision considers the needs of people with disability. The Workers' Compensation Act of 1999 changed the law relating to workers' compensation for injuries on the job.
Unique challenges.
People with disabilities and HIV status.
Zambia is affected by a generalized HIV epidemic. Individuals with disabilities face unique challenges in getting access to HIV testing and treatment. There is also a lack of information and education available in formats such as Braille, large print or via sign-language interpreters. Children with disabilities also have trouble accessing HIV prevention information. In addition, the social stigma of disability and having HIV means that some individuals prefer to die at home rather than receive treatment for HIV. People who are both HIV positive and have a disability have reported that "they were seen as 'other' and 'less than human' by" health care providers. They report "disability-related stigma that became heightened by the presence of HIV."
Many disabled individuals have reported losing their jobs after discovery of their HIV status has been revealed. These individuals turn to begging for money, which is also frowned upon in most Zambian communities. Those who do have jobs find that it is difficult to take their HIV medications on time outside of the home.
People with disabilities who are also HIV positive are generally assumed to not be engaging in sexual activity, when in fact, they "may be equally as sexually active as others and at increased risk of sexual abuse." Assumptions about their sexuality can impact their health. They have also had their privacy disregarded by health care workers who were shocked to discover a person with disabilities who was also HIV positive: "whenever they find a person with disability who is positive, it becomes a shock to them. They share it with other counsellors, and then it get broken into society."
Children with intellectual disabilities.
Parents of children with intellectual disabilities (ID) in Zambia have found that healthcare professionals do not have an "understanding of their child's condition" and the effects the condition can have on the caregivers.
Disability culture.
Arts.
A project to train disabled Zambians in filmmaking was launched in 2016.
Sport.
Disabled sport in Zambia is organised by the National Paralympic Committee of Zambia since its establishment in 2005. Zambia has participated in Summer Paralympic Games in 1996, 2000, 2008, and 2012. They have yet to win any medals.
Special Olympics Zambia has sent teams to the 2007, 2011 and 2015 editions of the Special Olympics World Summer Games.

Edlingham railway station

Edlingham railway station served the village of Edlingham, Northumberland, England from 1887 to 1953 on the Cornhill Branch.
History.
The station was opened on 5 September 1887 by the North Eastern Railway. It was situated at the end of an approach road that runs north from the B6341. To the west of the station was a goods yard, which had two sidings, one serving a cattle dock and the other serving a small goods shed. The goods traffic at the station was never large: only six wagons of livestock were loaded in 1913. The station was downgraded to an unstaffed halt on 23 August 1926 and closed to passengers on 22 September 1930. The name was changed to Edlingham Siding on 14 February 1938; it finally closed completely on 2 March 1953.

Leiden Draft

The Leiden Draft is the translation used in Anglophone historiography of the Dutch-language concept "Leids Ontwerp", a draft-manifesto discussed by the Holland congress of representatives of "exercitiegenootschappen" (Patriot militias) on 8 October 1785 in Leiden in the context of the so-called Patriot revolution of 1785 in the Dutch Republic. This draft resulted in publication of the manifesto entitled "Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken, Leiden, aangenomen bij besluit van de Provinciale Vergadering van de Gewapende Corpsen in Holland, op 4 oktober 1785 te Leiden" (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of Regent and Citizen). It contained an exposition of the Patriot ideology and arrived at the formulation of twenty proposals of political reform in a democratic vein. 
The ideas were only realized to a large extent under the Batavian Republic, when they inspired the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, but they were earlier also influential in the intellectual history of the French Revolution thanks to the French translation the journalist Antoine Marie Cerisier, a collaborator of Mirabeau, published in 1788. According to American and British historians Jeremy D. Popkin and Jonathan Israel this French translation may have influenced the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.
Background.
The American Revolution made a deep impression in the Dutch Republic of the 1770s. Intellectuals like Joan Derk van der Capellen tot den Pol and his friend François Adriaan van der Kemp disseminated the ideas of Thomas Paine, Richard Price, Andrew Fletcher and Joseph Priestley, and generally news about the accomplishments of the American revolutionaries. On the one hand this helped convince Dutch public opinion to support the American Revolution, but on the other hand undermined the autocratic government of stadtholder William V and his Orangist party of "Regenten". The public support of the American revolutionaries helped bring about an armed conflict with Great Britain, the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, which was mishandled by the stadtholder to such an extent that the criticisms of his regime gained wide support under the population. His opponents were found in circles of the old anti-Orangist ("States party") faction among Dutch regents, and among adherents of democratic ideals. These came together as a political movement that called themselves "Patriots". As the stadtholder controlled the armed forces: the Dutch States Army and the Dutch Navy, the Patriots started to arm themselves by forming citizen militias, known as "exercitiegenootschappen" (so-called, because they liked to train themselves by the performance of military drills). These were local militias, overlaid by a federal association that bound them together and made them a national force to be reckoned with. The regime saw this as a threat and tried to discourage their operations where possible. On 23 July 1785 (as one example) the city government of Leiden prohibited the activities of the Leiden "exercitiegenootschap" and fined its drill master. This elicited a reaction by both the local and the provincial militia: they organised a congress of representatives of Holland militias that convened on 8 October 1785 in Leiden in the meeting room of the Society "Kunst wordt door Arbeid verkregen" (Art is the result of Labour), one of the Patriot clubs in Leiden
Genesis of the manifesto.
At this congress a draft of a manifesto was adopted that became known as the "Leiden Ontwerp" (which is often translated into English as "Leiden Draft"). Who exactly wrote this draft was not entirely clear. However it is likely that the members of the commission that was charged by the congress with the writing of a final document, also had had a hand in the original draft. These were the journalist Wybo Fijnje, the Leiden textile manufacturer Pieter Vreede, and the Overijssel aristocrat Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck; less known are François Adriaan van der Kemp, Jacob Blauw and Cornelis van Foreest. On 4 October 1785, after four sessions they edited the final draft that was published as "Ontwerp om de Republiek door eene heilzaame Vereeniging van Belangen van Regent en Burger van Binnen Gelukkig en van Buiten Gedugt te maaken, aangenomen bij besluit van de Provinciale Vergadering van de Gewapende Corpsen in Holland" (Design to make the Republic inwardly contented and outwardly feared by a salutary union of interests of Regent and Citizen, Leiden, adopted by resolution of the Provincial Assembly of the Armed Forces in Holland) by the publisher Leendert Herdingh. Colonels of the exercitiegenootschappen from Alkmaar and Westzaan were present. The design became so popular that in May 1786 a third edition was necessary. The journalist Gerrit Paape later wrote that a copy of the manifesto was in almost everybody's hand.
Main points.
In the 68 pages of the document first an exposition was given of the main ideas behind the "design" into which the argument issued. That argument may be summarized by giving the headings of the sections of the paper (in translation):
 1. Necessity of the preservation of the originally good Constitution, by correction of the abuses that have slipped in
 2. The stadtholderate not a sufficient means for the repair of the original Constitution
 3. The detrimental and offensive fact of the independence of the Regents from the people, whose representatives they are
 4. What has much contributed in later times to enlarge the detrimental effects of the independence of the Regents
 5. Dangers to which the Regents are subject in case they don't want to enter into the project of reform
 6. Dangers to which the independence of the Regents subjects the liberty of the Citizen
 7. Advantages of this Reform for the Regents
 8. Rights of the People in relation to Petitions
 9. Necessity of the Constitutional Reform in relation to National Defense
 10. Necessity of a Constitutional Reform for improvement of public morals and for economic growth
 11. Conclusions from the above arguments as foundations of the Reform, and correct stipulation of everybody's rights
The argument resulted in an enumeration of twenty numbered articles:
 I. Freedom is an inalienable right of all Dutch citizens. No power on Earth can impede them to make use of that Freedom
 II. This Freedom would be illusory if it would not be founded on the right to be governed under laws to which the citizens have consented, either in person, or by their representatives
 III. These representatives must not be independent of those they represent, and their appointment by the People according to a constant and regulated system is an appropriate means to prevent such independence
 IV. The return of this right of appointment to the People must consist of either annual election by the People of municipal magistrates, or at least the nomination of the candidates from which the magistrates co-opt new members of the magistracy
 V. Though sovereignty ultimately belongs to the People, for practical reasons government must be left to state colleges and departments. The People retain the right to influence government by petitions and addresses. To enable the People to do this in a reasoned form they have to be informed by a Free Press and have to enjoy Freedom of Expression that may not be subject to prior restraint, though it may subject to judicial sanction after the fact
 VI. Everywhere the Regents promote this Constitutional Reform they may not be deprived arbitrarily of their existing offices, unless those offices contravene this new Constitution, or one person holds two incompatible offices
 VII. The People will have to leave the officers they have elected to do their job during their time in office and to give them their trust
 VIII. The officers of the Municipal Militias will be elected by their members and in case the regulations declare government and military offices incompatible, those regulations will be scrupulously observed
 IX. Nobody will be eligible for government office who has not served in a militia
 X. Citizen-commissioners will be appointed to audit the public accounts and to guarantee the exercise of rights
 XI. There will be regular accounts of the Public Finances on all government levels
 XII. Citizen-commissioners will have the right and duty to investigate matters concerning industry and trade and to recommend policies pertaining to those matters to the government
 XIII. Citizen-commissioners will not step down from their posts all at once, but only a part of the membership will be renewed periodically
 XIV. Though the state has to make expenditures for the maintenance of infrastructure and those expenditures must therefore not suffer undue austerity, the People have the right to demand the abolition of useless and costly institutions and practices, with just compensation for the holders of the abolished rights and offices
 XV. The electors of Magistrates must be the members of the militias, unless this right of election belonged to the Guilds
 XVI. To avoid the problem of electors selling their vote, the right of election will be reserved to people with a certain position of wealth, depending on local circumstances
 XVII. Regulations may be made as to the qualifications of both electors and their representatives
 XVIII. Petty offices should preferentially be given to people of exemplary behavior, military veterans, and people originating locally (instead of people from abroad)
 XIX. Civic militias should be promoted so as to support the Army against foreign enemies and to oppose that Army in case it becomes the instrument of domestic tyranny
 XX. To serve those two purposes the citizens should be divided in three classes, whose members, selected by drawing lots, will have to serve in the militia in rotation
Influence.
A close reading of the "Design" will teach that the editors of the document revered the existing "constitution" of the Dutch Republic (in the sense of a body of foundational charters and treaties, like the Great Privilege, the Pacification of Ghent, the Union of Utrecht, the Twelve Years' Truce, and the Peace of Münster), but rejected a number of "abuses" that had recently "slipped in" like the so-called "Regeringsreglementen" (Government Regulations) that had been adopted in the course of the Orangist Revolution of 1747 to give the stadtholder a right of appointment, or at least approval, of city magistrates. The Patriots wanted to roll back these recent reforms and replace them with the right of the citizenry, just below the caste of "Regenten", but above the "lower classes," to elect those magistrates, or at least nominate candidates for co-option by the "vroedschappen" that traditionally had the right to elect them. In other words, they implicitly accepted the existing "constitution", with its special political rights for the "Regenten", but put a new "reading" on it, "clawing back" so to speak the "ancient" rights of the guilds and "schutterijen" to influence local government, and through its intermediary, regional and national government. To justify this they proclaimed a popular sovereignty that was to replace the sovereignty claimed by the provincial States and the States-General (another of those "abuses", as the sovereignty of the States was always supposed to be derived from "the People").
The Leiden Draft therefore was not only a declaration of principles, but also a political program of overturning, not the political structure of the Republic, but the composition of the "personnel" occupying the magistracy with the use of more or less "democratic" elections. The Patriots soon started to put this program in execution, beginning in the city of Utrecht where the old government was replaced with a democratically elected one. Soon other city governments in especially Holland, Utrecht province, Overijssel and Friesland went over to the Patriot side, usually, however, by having Orangist regents replaced by adherents of the old States party, whose families had been driven out in 1747, but had taken up the explicit invitation in the Leiden Draft to cast their lot with the democrats. Sometimes, however, even those old-style regents were replaced by representatives of the middle-class citizenry (like in Utrecht, Leiden, Delft and Rotterdam), breaching the traditional monopoly of political office of the Regent class. This "attack" on their position started to disturb the Patriot regents, who gradually started to drift away from their more radically "democratic" brethren in the Patriot movement. But the wave of democratic reform seemed unstoppable when in the Summer of 1787 the Amsterdam "vroedschap" was overturned after large street demonstrations of the local Patriot clubs and the Patriot "exercitiegenootschap". This went too far for the old-style regents, a number of whom started to move over to the camp of the stadtholder. However, it took military intervention by the king of Prussia, brother of the wife of the stadtholder and hence his brother-in-law, to suppress what had become the Patriot Revolution in the Fall of 1787. After this the personnel changes in the city governments and the States were reversed and the post-1747 system restored, in a more severe form, under the 1788 Act of Guarantee that seemed to cast the stadtholderate in stone.
The Patriot Revolution therefore seemed to be stopped in its tracks, and rolled back, but that did not imply that the influence of the Leiden Draft also had forever dissipated. The 1770s and 1780s were a time of intensive contact and exchange of ideas across European frontiers by like-minded intellectuals. Among those involved were the French journalist Antoine-Marie Cerisier, who had been in the center of the Patriot Revolution, and therefore, like many other leading Patriots had to go into exile in France. There he became a close collaborator of Mirabeau, the trailblazer of the French Revolution, who took a keen interest in political developments in the Dutch Republic. Cerisier did not write the Leiden Draft himself as Popkin has it, but excerpted it in French in an article in "Analyse des Papiers Anglais" in 1788. According to Popkin, who conducted extensive archival research into the matter, this excerpt eventually influenced the formulation of the "Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen" of 1789, one of the foundational documents of the French Revolution. In a 2007 oration, Jonathan Israel supported this thesis.
And so the "path of influence" of the Leiden Draft eventually doubled back to the Netherlands, because the exiled Patriots returned with the triumphant armies of the Revolutionary French Republic in 1795 and this time definitively overturned the old Dutch Republic and its institutions. Again, the political method of the Leiden Draft program was used by working ostensibly "within" the old constitution, by taking over the personnel of the old institutions like the States of Holland that was in a "constitutional" way replaced by the Provisional Representatives of the People of Holland, and the States-General that for a while became the States General of the Batavian Republic, before it legislated itself out of existence at the end of 1795 to be replaced by the National Assembly of the Batavian Republic. One of the first official acts of the Provisional Representatives was the promulgation of the Dutch Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, that was drawn up by a commission, chaired by Pieter Paulus, which certainly took the Leiden Draft into account as one of its inspirations.

The Auctioneer (film)

The Auctioneer is a 1927 American silent comedy drama film directed by Alfred E. Green and starring George Sidney, Marian Nixon and Gareth Hughes. It was originally planned for Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell to appear in supporting roles in the film, before both had become stars by that point and other actors were cast. The film was adapted from a (1901) David Belasco stage play of the same name.
Premise.
Simon Levi, a Jewish immigrant pawnbroker builds up a successful business. His daughter Ruth marries stockbroker Richard Eagan. They are swindled by stockbroker Paul Groode, and forced to labor in the streets to make financial ends meet. Eventually, they achieve retribution against Groode and the movie ends happily for the stockbrokers.
Release.
The film was a serious financial disappointment for the Fox Film company. Made on a budget of $304,000, it took $317,000 worldwide which led to a $106,000 loss once distribution cost are factored in. This was the worst performance by a Fox film that year.
Reception.
"The Film Daily" wrote, "The David Belasco stage play became famous more for the acting of David Warfield than for the importance of the play itself and so the picture becomes entertaining because of the characterization of George Sidney rather than for the story it tells. The theme is slight and of the familiar "Abie's Irish Rose" variety. But Sidney's fine acting, his typical Jewish humor, plus a quantity of first class comedy incident, makes the picture satisfying. The introduction of the kangaroo offers one of the best laugh sequences of the picture. There is the usual heart interest twist and the happy ending."
"Moving Picture World" said, "So far as the plot interest is concerned it is considerably drawn out and moves forward rather slowly. More emphasis has been placed on the comedy but it is principally on the characterization of George Sidney that the audience appeal depends, and he certainly gives an excellent performance... This simple little story is rich in human interest and emotional appeal and George Sidney gives a performance that alternately plays upon the emotions and keeps the spectator in smiles."
"Variety" wrote, ""The Auctioneer" has enough in its favor to make it a worthwhile major house booking. It is a wholesome picture, has comedy and pathos. Photographically it is splendid [...] Sidney stands out all the way and the continuity gets a gouge here and there to permit him a few extra comedy bits. The theme is deftly handled".
Writing for "Chicago Daily Tribune", Mae Tinee wrote, ""The Auctioneer" is a homely, heartsome picture that will linger pleasantly in your memory" and commented that a fighting kangaroo was the funniest thing in the film.
A review in the "Woodward Daily Press" of Woodward, Oklahoma said, "Alfred E. Green, who directed the production, took advantage of every opportunity to make the picture more life-like and human, at the same time losing none of spirit of the original play. It is, according to advance reports, one of the best pictures of its kind ever produced and promises to create as big a sensation as the play".

Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida

Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida () is a 2004 Brazilian fantasy adventure children's film, written by Flávio de Souza, directed by Moacyr Góes, produced by Diler Trindade and distributed by Warner Bros. and Globo Filmes. Starring Xuxa Meneghel, Marcos Pasquim, Juliana Knust, Paulo Vilhena, Sérgio Hondjakoff, Natália Lage, Zezé Motta, Bruna Marquezine, Milton Gonçalves and Sérgio Malheiros. Xuxa lives a biologist in a town near the Amazon Rainforest. Alongside the brothers Riacho and Manhã, she seeks the lost city of Igdrasil, which according to legend was founded by descendants of Vikings who crossed the Atlantic Ocean and ventured down the Amazon River.
Director Góes developed the script based on influences from films such as Indiana Jones "Raiders of the Lost Ark", other influences include Allan Quatermain's "Lost City of Gold"s and William Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream". In addition to containing references of Inca and Scandinavian mythology, Brazilian folklore (in the figure of Curupira) and patriotic-environmental pedagogy, used in the territorial defense of the Amazon.
The film debuted on December 17, 2004, in 320 rooms in Brazil. It performed well at the box office, grossing R$7 million reais with more than 1,331,652 million box offices. "Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" received widespread criticism from critics and audiences.
Plot.
Barbara (Xuxa Meneghel), a timid and monosyllabic biologist, lives in Beirada D'Oeste, a fictional city bordering the Amazon rainforest. She leads a gang of heroes who will stop at Igdrasil, a legendary underground city, populated by descendants of Vikings that crossed the Atlantic and plunged into the Amazon River. Barbara confronts Igor (Marcos Pasquim), her ex-husband, with whom he restrains his passion and interrupted romance, and leads the heroes, with two brothers of 8 and 9 years, dangerous, dangerous and disgusting to reach Igdrasil. in the capture of the villain, who stole from Igdrasil the sacred treasure, which is astonishing as well as valuable. As a token of the encounters and disagreements of the heroes and villains that lead to the lost city and its treasure, there is the Curupira, a magical personage of the Brazilian folklore, that fulfills the functions of Puck, personage of the Nordic folk of the piece A Midsummer Night's Dream, of William Shakespeare, the basis of our plot. In addition to being a (well) free adaptation of this classic Shakespeare comedy, "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" is also an adventure film with elements of fantasy mixed with historical facts and events, as well as moments of danger, suspense, emotion, romance and mood fit for people of all ages.
Production.
After the release of "Xuxa Abracadabra", Xuxa started working on the concept of his new film as early as February 2004, the production of the new feature film, would have to go through the choice of Xuxa, began in the first week of the month with casting, although the new film did not have the title defined yet at that time. Once again the direction is of Moacyr Góes, also responsible for the previous film of Xuxa, "Abracadabra". The script is by the playwright, writer and director Flávio de Souza. Souza and Góes became influential in Indiana Jones' "Raiders of the Lost Ark" to create the concept of the film, other influences include Allan Quatermain's "Lost City of Gold"s and William Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream". In addition to containing references of Inca and Scandinavian mythology, Brazilian folklore (in the figure of Curupira) and patriotic-environmental pedagogy, used in the territorial defense of the Amazon. Xuxa struggles against the clandestine exploitation of biodiversity in the role of a scientist with divine powers. The main message of the film is the defense of biodiversity, with attacks on the covetousness of Americans in relation to the Brazilian Amazon. "The ecological theme is fundamental and is of interest to Xuxa. Today, nothing is as important as the appreciation of the ecosystem," reflects Góes. The name of the fictional underground lost and legendary city of Igdrasil, populated by descendants of Vikings. It was created on the basis of a Norse mythology, which means "Tree of Life". On criticism of his films, Xuxa countered. "If my films are blockbusters because they are seen by a lot of people, then I want to continue doing this. I do not want to make a movie that is praised (for criticism) but nobody wants to review it," says TV hots.
According to the producer, Xuxa is silent on the new film for a script option." Xuxa questioned this:"I, who speak so much, will be monosyllabic?...," she said, and she was even a little worried. In a booklet of "O Tesouro da Cidade Perdida", the presenter philosophizes on the question: "The message I want to spend in this film is not so expensive, since having a respect for nature is one of the lines I did not have in any dialogue, I want to make it clear that when we respect every living thing, every little animal, every plant, everything in general, we are respecting everything that God has done and gave us the best. "Xuxa has enjoyed this story of being an introverted woman who suddenly discovers that she is a woman, and that she is a very goddess." The scriptwriter has his version: "In "Abracadabra", Xuxa played a character who spoke a lot, this time Barbara is very shy and monosyllabic. Xuxa liked this story of being an introverted woman who suddenly discovers that she is a goddess. The total budget "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida", was R$6 million reais and debuted in 320 rooms in the country. Director Góes (2003) says that although she does not consider herself an actress, he likes her interpretation: "Xuxa has a great presence on screen, lending her characters a lot of authority. Since she does not pretend to be an actress, she puts a lot of her personality into her characters." Actress Natália Lage, who lives Helena in the film, pointed out that children's audiences are seldom targeted by national film productions: "The responsibility for making films of this category is much greater because it is a public in formation," he notes.
To interpret Igor, the love interest of "Tesouro da Cidade Perdida", was chosen the actor Marcos Pasquim. Before filming the scene of the kiss, says Xuxa, she asked Pasquim how he would like her to do, how could be the kiss. The actor decided on the famous technical kiss and when he approached Xuxa she said: "Do you smoke?". Unappealing, Pasquim left the scene and came back with a bunch of bullet in his mouth. "The first time was like kissing an ashtray, but then I kissed the actor," Xuxa said. Other actors that participate in the cast are Juliana Knust (Jéssica), Paulo Vilhena (Lisandro), Natália Lage (Helena), Sérgio Hondjakoff (Demétrio), Zezé Motta (Aurora Hipólito), Milton Gonçalves (Hélio Hipólito), Sérgio Malheiros (Thor).

Reception.
Critical reception.
"Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" received low critical acclaim. Mario Fanatic Abadde of the site "Omelete" gave a bad note to the film, justifying that the script of the film is "weak and insipid" because according to him "tries to put together a handful of images played with perfunctory performances." Perhaps the screenwriter Flávio de Souza, knowing that with this (Juliana Knust), Lisandro (Paulo Vilhena), Helena (Natalia Lage) and Demetrius (Sergio Hondjakof). It's a lesson in how to assassinate a William Shakespeare classic." A "Cineclick" critic also criticized the script for the film, writing that "it shows a series of ill-explained parallel stories and poorly constructed characters." praising only the participation of the character Curupira, in which he defined as "a Gollum (Lord of the Rings) tupiniquim." Giving a five-star. Jurandir Filho of the site "Cinema com Rapadura", criticized the script of the film for being "Very bad! On paper it looks beautiful, but on the screen of the cinema is horrible.It is a mixture of parallel stories without notion and in the end you do not understand anything". For him the script is "extremely childish, can not be charismatic for adults (can not even swallow) and in the end, the older (13 years and above) will realize that it is just another Slot machine, as well as the films of former hit artist Didi. He defined Xuxa's performance as "lousy," and Bruna Marquezine as "pitiful." Writing that the actress "is badly used in this film, as are most of the actors." just praised the performance of actor Sergio Malheiros writing that "he fulfills his role reasonably. Like Milton Gonçalves and Zezé Motta who are there just to give some credibility to the production. Cléber Eduardo of "Contra Campo", wrote that "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" "reaffirms and accentuates the heroine's condition of the hots-actress: if in two previous films she saw elves, already sketching a mystical trait of the goodness of her persona, mysticism is promoted to divinity, but without any rupture with reason."
A "Cineweb" writer, he criticized the influence of William Shakespeare in the script writing that "it suits just for pretext to tell a love story involving the persongaens of the film." Paulo Santos Lima, of IstoÉ, criticized the director of "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida", writing that he "dared, but he did not do it. And whose fragmentation of approaches creates distancing with the public, which he does not even know what it is; the infantile fable of "Duendes" and "Abracadabra" and also not sagacious enough for adolescents." he still wrote that "Xuxa is lost between the children's audience and the youth in a plot run by Moacyr Góes." Claudio Szynkier, writing to "Folha", criticized the concept of fatherhood set out in the film "full of disappeared, rejected or cretin parents: a dark and strangely symptomatic idea of culture in which there is an authority of the image (in this case, Globo TV) playing paternal role. a system that also provides for the collage of synthetic fragments of a film imaginary: "Indiana Jones" grafted here, "The Goonies" there, all as fuel structural, fast consumption, for the film floor. The audiences surveyed for Adorocinema gave the film 4 stars out of five, with a score of 3.8 points. The "Filmow" site gave an average rating of 1.9 points to "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida".
Box office.
The Xuxa box office forecast and the "Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida" was to account for between 2 million and 3 million viewers. However, the film reached a lower number than expected with 1,331,652 million box offices, the second most watched national film in the year after "Two Sons of Francisco", and the 20th most viewed of the year in Brazil, with a gross of more of 7,108,730.00.

W. Ian McDonald

William Ian McDonald (15 March 1933 – 13 December 2006) was a New Zealand neurologist and academic. Having taught and practiced in New Zealand and the United States, he was Professor of Neurology at the Institute of Neurology of the University of London, England, from 1974 to 1998. He was the world leading authority on multiple sclerosis (MS) in the second half of the twentieth-century: the McDonald criteria used to diagnose MS are named after him.
He earned Bachelors of Medical Science at the University of Otago in Dunedin (1955), MBChB with Distinction (1957) and PhD (1962). MBChB is a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees a degree awarded after 5 years of what is analogous to a combined undergraduate-graduate course of study. Such degrees can be awarded in the U.K. and other countries (such as New Zealand and South Africa). McDonald's doctoral thesis work dealt with experimental neuropathy in cats induced by diphtheria toxin. It was conducted at the Department of Physiology under the supervision of Professor Archie McIntyre. 
He lectured widely both in the United Kingdom and abroad. He received, in 1968, a fellowship of the Royal Australian College of Physicians, in 1972 of the London Royal College of Physicians, in 1989 of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists in 1989, and in 1999 of the Academy of Medical Sciences. Accolades for his work included 15 prizes for multiple sclerosis research, a dozen honorary fellowships, and honorary membership of 10 overseas neurological associations.

Suki (song)

 is a song recorded by Japanese band Dreams Come True for their seventh studio album, "Delicious" (1995). It was released as the album's lead single by Epic/Sony Records on November 4, 1994. An English version of the song, dubbed "Suki (Worldwide Version)", was featured on the 1996 film "Shichigatsu Nanoka, Hare", starring Alisa Mizuki and Masato Hagiwara.
Composition.
"Suki" was written and composed by Miwa Yoshida, arranged by Masato Nakamura and co-produced by the band and Mike Pela. The song is written in the key of F-sharp major with a common time tempo of 65 beats per minute. Yoshida's vocals span three octaves, from F3 to C5 in modal voice, and up to F6 in head voice.
Critical reception.
CDJournal critics called "Suki" a gospel-tinged love song. Yoshida, who is accompanied by a live piano only, unlike on the album version which also includes a strings section, was praised for producing a vocal performance that serves as the "main instrument" of the track. The backing gospel choir was also praised for delivering the lyrics with gravitas and style. Gackt, who covered the song in 2017, has praised Yoshida's lyrics about heartbreak and considers "Suki" to be his favorite love song.
Cover versions.
In 2005, Mink recorded a cover of "Suki" for her eponymous debut album, "Mink". In 2010, Juju recorded her rendition of the song for the cover album "Request". Crystal Kay has covered the song twice, once as a dance-pop rendition, included as a B-side to the single "One" (2008), and a second time, as a piano ballad in the vein of the original song, which was also included as a B-side to the single "Lovin' You" (2016). She also performed the song live at the tribute concert Minna de Dori Suru? Do You Dreams Come True Special Live held on March 10, 2009 in celebration of their 20th anniversary.
Chart performance.
"Suki" debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 181,000 copies sold in its first week. It dropped to number five the next week, selling 103,000 copies. The single stayed in the top ten one last week, ranking at number nine and selling 66,000 copies. "Suki" then slid to number eleven, where it stayed for two consecutive weeks, before dropping to number 17 on its sixth charting week and out of the top twenty entirely the following week. With only three weeks worth of sales counting toward the tally, "Suki" ranked at number 77 on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart for 1994. The single charted in the top 100 for sixteen weeks and sold a reported total of 591,000 copies.

North Wales Water Authority

The North Wales Water Authority (NWWA) is a water utility and municipal authority providing drinking water to portions of Bucks and Montgomery counties in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania, centered around the borough of North Wales. The authority serves over 25,000 customers in seven municipalities and also provides wholesale water to other water authorities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. The NWWA was established by the borough of North Wales in 1951 and has expanded its service area since then.
Service area.
The NWWA serves over 25,000 customers across seven municipalities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. In Montgomery County, the NWWA serves the borough of North Wales, most of Montgomery Township, most of Upper Gwynedd Township, most of Lower Gwynedd Township, part of Whitpain Township, and part of Upper Dublin Township. In Bucks County, the NWWA serves part of New Britain Township.
In addition to providing water to customers in its service area, the NWWA provides wholesale water to other water authorities in Bucks and Montgomery counties. Water authorities that receive wholesale water from NWWA include the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority, the Doylestown Township Municipal Authority, the Horsham Water and Sewer Authority, the Warminster Municipal Authority, the Warrington Township Water and Sewer Department, and the Warwick Township Water and Sewer Authority.
Governance.
The NWWA is a municipal authority that consists of a five-member board of directors appointed to staggered five-year terms by the North Wales Borough Council. The authority is governed by an executive team that consists of an Executive Director, a Solicitor, and Engineer of Record. As of 2018, Robert C. Bender is the Executive Director of NWWA.
Water supply.
Much of the water delivered to customers by the NWWA is treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont, a facility that is owned jointly with the North Penn Water Authority (NPWA). The water treated at this plant comes from the North Branch Neshaminy Creek, which flows into Lake Galena, a reservoir for the water treated at the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. Water released from Lake Galena flows down the creek to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant. During the summer months and times when water levels are low, additional water is pumped from the Delaware River at Point Pleasant and diverted to the North Branch Neshaminy Creek near Gardenville. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant is the largest water treatment plant in Bucks County and processes up to 40 million gallons water a day for delivery to NPWA and NWWA customers. From the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant, a main carries water to the NWWA service area, where it is delivered to customers.
History.
The NWWA was established as a municipal authority by the borough of North Wales in 1951 to take over the privately-owned North Wales Water Company, which served 1,200 customers at the time. The NWWA expanded its service area into Upper Gwynedd Township and Lower Gwynedd Township in order to provide water service to those areas. After a drought hit the area in 1964, the authority expanded its service territory into Montgomery Township. In the late 1960s, the NWWA acquired the Blue Bell Water Company, which added Whitpain Township to its service area. The authority acquired the Upper Dublin and Delaware Valley Industrial Water Companies in 1979, which expanded its service area into Upper Dublin Township, including the office parks in Fort Washington. The NWWA expanded its service area into New Britain Township in Bucks County in the 1980s. In 1987, the NPWA and the NWWA began construction of an Interim Treatment Plant at the present location of the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in Chalfont. The interim plant opened in February 1989 and supplied 3.2 million gallons of water a day. Construction of a permanent Forest Park Water Treatment Plant to supply 20 million gallons of water a day began in June 1991. The Forest Park Water Treatment Plant began operation on June 21, 1994. An expansion to the Forest Park Water Treatment Plant in 2007 increased the output to 40 million gallons of water a day to keep up with the growing water use of the area. On July 30, 2019, Warrington Township agreed to sell their water system to the NWWA for $17 million.

List of accolades received by Darkest Hour (film)

"Darkest Hour" is a 2017 war drama film directed by Joe Wright and written by Anthony McCarten. It stars Gary Oldman as Winston Churchill, and is an account of his early days as Prime Minister, as Nazi Germany's "Wehrmacht" swept across Western Europe, threatening to defeat the United Kingdom during World War II. The film also stars Kristin Scott Thomas, Lily James, Ben Mendelsohn, Stephen Dillane, and Ronald Pickup.
The film had its world premiere at the Telluride Film Festival on 1 September 2017, and also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival. It began a limited release in the United States on 22 November 2017, before expanding on 22 December, and was released on 12 January 2018 in the United Kingdom.

Max M. Axelrod

Max M. Axelrod (February 22, 1911 – March 30, 2004) was a businessman, sports pioneer, and social welfare activist from Cleveland, Ohio. He is known for founding the "Cleveland Jewish News" and Lake Forest Country Club and his charitable work with the Jewish Welfare Fund Appeal, Cleveland State University and the United Negro College Fund.
Early life.
Axelrod was born in Cleveland, Ohio in 1911 to Russian immigrants Peter and Mary Axelrod. Peter Axelrod founded The Cleveland Dairy, as farming and the production of kefir was the family business in Russia. His great uncle was Russian Menshevik revolutionary Pavel Borisovich Axelrod , the founder of Pravda, the official newspaper of Russia and inventor of keifer.
Max Axelrod graduated from Western Reserve University during the Great Depression with degrees in mathematics and law. Axelrod served in WWII with the U.S. Army in Eritrea, Somalia and throughout the Middle East, as both a lawyer and an intelligence officer for the US government.
Career.
Axelrod founded The Cleveland Concession Co. in 1929 and held concession contracts with venues such as The Cleveland Municipal Stadium, The Cleveland Arena, The Cleveland Convention Center, Old League Park, The Public Auditorium and the Akron Rubber Bowl. He also served concessions at special community events, such as the Great Lakes Exposition in 1937.
For three years, Axelrod was chairman of the Cleveland Boxing Commission and ran the Cleveland Arena. He was an avid supporter of young African-American boxers and legitimized the sport by moving it from underground, Mafia-run warehouses to the Cleveland Arena. The most notable of these boxing matches was Jake LaMotta vs. Laurent Dauthuille in 1950. The fight was profiled in the 1980 film "Raging Bull".
He bought several delicatessens in Cleveland, most famously the New Yorker Deli on Chester Avenue.
In the 1960s, Axelrod partnered with Yankees owner George Steinbrenner in an attempt to buy the Cleveland Browns. The pair also worked together to restart the Cleveland Air Show in 1964.
Axelrod founded and later served as president of Lake Forest Country Club in Hudson, Ohio. Prior to WWII, country clubs didn't allow Jews or African-Americans to join, so Axelrod created his own that did not discriminate in employment or membership.
Jewish Community activism.
In the late 1950s Axelrod began his social welfare and charitable work in the Cleveland area.
He became a lifelong trustee of the Jewish Federation of Cleveland. In 1972 he headed the Jewish Welfare Fund Appeal, helping to raise millions and making numerous trips to Israel to serve on the board of the National Conference of Christians and Jews. Together with Lloyd Schwenger and several other Cleveland community leaders, Axelrod founded the "Cleveland Jewish News" in 1964 and served as the paper's first president. Max is listed as "President Emeritus" in the papers history.
Legacy.
Following his death in 2004, Axelrod's daughter Lisa Axelrod fulfilled his wishes by scattering his ashes below what was remaining of the wall of Old League Park in a private ceremony. Max wanted his final resting place to be where his business and love of the game first started. The City of Cleveland reopened the Old League Park to the public on August 23, 2014 as the Baseball Heritage Museum and Fannie Lewis Community Park at League Park. It features murals of the great Cleveland League and Negro league players who worked with Axelrod.

Esterra Park

Esterra Park is a transit-oriented development under construction in the Overlake area of Redmond, Washington. The , project is near major regional shopping and employment centers and multiple modes of transportation, including the future Overlake Village light rail station scheduled to open in 2023. The Esterra Park campus is expected to be home to a combined 8,000 residents and workers.
Description.
Esterra Park is part of the new, 175-acre Overlake Village neighborhood in the Overlake area of Redmond, Washington, near Bellevue. The original plans for Esterra Park include of office, 25,000 square feet of retail, 1,400 residential units, a 250-room hotel, and a public park. Combined commercial space would be about . Changes to the plans have increased the number of housing units to 2,900 while reducing office space.
Home to the headquarters of Microsoft and Nintendo of America and 46,000 jobs, Overlake is the 3rd-biggest regional growth center by number of jobs in the Central Puget Sound area, as established by the Puget Sound Regional Council. Overlake is expected to add 25,000 jobs and 5,000 residential units by 2030. Overlake Village is expected to be approximately half the size of Seattle's South Lake Union neighborhood and home to up to 40,000 people when finished. The Overlake Park &amp; Ride and Overlake Transit Center are in the immediate area as well as numerous major employers and of retail within a 1-mile radius, including the Overlake Shopping Center.
Transportation.
As a transit-oriented development (TOD), Esterra Park is in close proximity to multiple modes of transportation, including pedestrian, bicycle, auto, bus, as well as light rail under construction. These modes include the King County Metro RapidRide B-Line bus service, the State Route 520 freeway to downtown Redmond and Seattle, and the Sound Transit East Link light rail extension project.
History.
The Esterra Park site was formerly a suburban medical campus of a regional health care provider, Group Health. The Overlake Village neighborhood was originally built in the 1960s and '70s and in recent years was zoned for higher density development as part of the City of Redmond's vision for the Overlake Urban Center. A master plan submitted to the city by Group Health for the redevelopment of the site, known as the Group Health-Overlake Village (Zone 4) Master Plan, was completed in December 2011. The Esterra Park project is "the first major redevelopment of Overlake Village."
Capstone Partners purchased the property from Group Health in March 2013 and during the same season began demolition of existing buildings on the site. Construction of the first building began around June 2014 and began on two further buildings as part of the first phase by the end of 2014. The entire project is expected to take several years to complete.
In 2017, it was reported that 500 residential units were already completed with an additional 1,000 units under construction and up to 1,400 more units planned in lieu of office space due to a simultaneous reduction in office demand and an increase in housing demand locally. The additional housing units would bring the community to a total of 2,900 homes.

Adventure in Washington

Adventure in Washington is a 1941 American drama film directed by Alfred E. Green and starring Herbert Marshall, Virginia Bruce and Gene Reynolds. The plot is about an unlikely U.S. Senate page boy whose misadventures in Washington, D.C., cause a Congressional scandal.
Based on a story by Jeanne Spencer and Albert Benham, the film was originally conceived in 1940 as a sequel to Columbia Pictures' hit film of the previous year set in the United States Senate, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", with Mickey Rooney in mind for the part of a juvenile delinquent who becomes a Senate page.
Gene Reynolds eventually got the role of the page when filming began in 1941. Virginia Bruce plays a female radio reporter covering the Capitol Hill beat, who fights for acceptance as a legitimate journalist in a male-dominated arena. Herbert Marshall's character as a prominent Senator eventually comes to appreciate her insights into human nature as well as her skill and they become close friends.
The film's sets designed by art director Lionel Banks were acclaimed for their attention to detail. It was released in Britain under the alternative title of Female Correspondent.
Plot.
Jim O'Brien (J. M. Kerrigan), an old friend of highly regarded U.S. Senator John Coleridge (Herbert Marshall), prevails upon the Senator to take under his wing a streetwise orphaned delinquent, teenager Marty Driscoll (Gene Reynolds), and appoint the youth as a Senate page boy. Because the boy's father had once helped Coleridge get his start in politics, the Senator reluctantly agrees.
Driscoll continues to be a troublemaker as a Senate page, acting as a smart-aleck around the other pages and in their school classes. He resents having to wear the knickers required as part of the Senate pages' uniform at the time, contending "I gave up short pants years ago". Told that it's a Senate tradition, he says, "I always thought knickers was for kids" "(a scene depicted in the movie poster)". He even gets into a fistfight with another page on the Senate floor (when the Senate is not in session) over a harmless initiation prank the other boys had played on him, resulting in a scolding by senior page Collins (Charles Smith) for his disgraceful behavior. Driscoll's attitude improves markedly, however, when he is befriended at a bowling alley by female radio commentator Jane Scott (Virginia Bruce), who counsels him to take advantage of the privileged opportunity he has been given as a Senate page.
Despite his reformed behavior, Driscoll is later wrongly accused by page headmaster Bundy (Vaughan Glaser) of eavesdropping on a private meeting of Senators and leaking confidential information. As a result, he is dismissed as a page by Coleridge, who disbelieves his protegé's tearful protestations of innocence. Distraught at being unjustly terminated, Driscoll decides to get his revenge by turning over privileged information about an upcoming major defense appropriation bill being considered by Coleridge's committee to businessman Frank Conroy (Pierre Watkin). The unscrupulous stock trader gives Driscoll a bribe for this inside information. When the confidential bill's provisions are subsequently publicized and the stock prices of certain defense-related companies soar, the resulting uproar embroils Sen. Coleridge in controversy and he is investigated by his Senate colleagues for sharing nonpublic information with investors, a violation of Federal law.
When Driscoll learns that his misconduct has landed his mentor in serious trouble, he is conscience-stricken and hitchhikes back to Washington, where he bursts into the investigating committee's hearing room to explain that he alone is to blame for the scandal. Although his full confession exonerates Coleridge, there remains the issue of what to do about Conroy's illegal conduct and Driscoll's complicity. The committee votes to indict Conroy and, at the urging of Coleridge, agrees to allow Driscoll's fate to be decided by his fellow pages. Meeting in the empty Senate chambers, one of the pages calls for his dismissal as unfit to be a page. But another page, Abbott (Dickie Jones, who also played a page in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"), comes to his defense, pointing out that, unlike themselves who came from privileged backgrounds with loving parents who set a good example, Driscoll's lack of these advantages and his voluntary confession should be taken into consideration.
After the pages decide that Driscoll may continue as one of their own, the film's final scene concludes as he rises to express his gratitude for their forgiveness. The erstwhile delinquent gives a tearful peroration, saying he's learned from those he's met there how to be an upstanding citizen, and especially that American representative democracy is government "of the people, by the people, for the people", as he recites from memory "The American's Creed".
Production.
The film was originally conceived in 1940 with Mickey Rooney in mind, as a sequel to Columbia Pictures' hit film of the previous year, "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington".
 The Senate gave permission for its pages to travel to Hollywood for filming in the summer of 1940, but those plans fell through as World War II engulfed Europe. After Mickey Rooney turned down the role of Marty Driscoll, 17-year old Gene Reynolds was cast for the part by the time shooting began on February 12, 1941.
Considerable attention was paid to authentic set design for the Senate chamber, including accurate reproduction of the Senators' desks and other furnishings, down to the snuff boxes at the Vice President's rostrum.
Female lead Virginia Bruce prepared for her role as a radio commentator by practicing the delivery style of fast-talking radio personality Floyd Gibbons. For the bowling sequence, she spent two days in a bowling alley rehearsing and shooting the scene, using a special, lightweight ball made of balsa wood.
Filming wrapped on March 24, 1941. "Adventure in Washington" was released on Memorial Day, May 30, 1941.
Critical response.
Not all members of Congress were pleased with the film's depiction of life on Capitol Hill, especially its scenes of fistfights and eavesdropping by pages. Congressman Donald McLean (R-NJ), in a speech in the U.S. House of Representatives, denounced the film's portrayal of things that didn't happen in real life. Having once been a Senate page himself 40 years before, he said it "undermine[d] the confidence of the electorate". International distribution of the film was not allowed by the Office of Censorship because of concerns that the storyline's portrayal of the bribing of a Senate page would "hinder the war effort".
The Ames (Iowa) "Daily Tribune" praised the cast's performances and the film's relevance about defense spending "at a time when the eyes of the nation are centered on defense", as WWII raged in Europe and tensions were rising between the U.S. and Japan. The newspaper lauded the cast as "splendid ... [having] roles calling for the utmost in their not inconsiderable talents". Actors Herbert Marshall and Gene Reynolds ("a new boy star") "possess roles of exceptional merit and provide performances to match", and Virginia Bruce gave a "memorable characterization" of the assertive reporter, the review said. "The Jackson Sun" gave a glowing review, saying that Marshall portrayed his Senator character as "both dignified and human" and Roynolds was "splendid". Bruce was singled out for praise, for her "wise-cracking role ... faintly satiric" of some radio reporters.
The "Atlanta Constitution" in a June 1, 1941, review called "Adventure in Washington" "thrilling" and complimented the production for the extent of detail in the sets representing the Senate chamber and page classrooms, down to the desks "and even the snuff boxes at the rostrum".
IMDb gives the film an aggregate score of 5.8/10, as of July 24, 2018.
Home media.
"Adventure in Washington" was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment as part of Sony's "Choice Collection" in 2013.

The Lords of Tantrazz

The Lords of Tantrazz is a 1996 adventure video game published by Atlantean Interactive Games.
Plot.
The player is an agent named Veronika Callahan who is tasked with fighting against an unimaginable evil named "The Hunger".
Gameplay.
The game is played in first-person 360° view. The cutscenes take place in the form of comic strips.
Development.
The game includes the voice of former Alice Cooper guitarist Kane Roberts and well as Alice Cooper himself. Post-retirement from the music industry, Roberts began production on three computer games, one of which was "The Lords of Tantrazz." In April 1996, a press release wrote that the title was set for the 3rd quarter of that year. When the game was released, Alice and Kane did promotional appearances for the game, though no word on Kane's other two projects was ever offered to the public.
Reception.
A reviewer for "Next Generation" remarked that "The game is so static it comes across more like a CD-romic than an actual game, especially since you can count the number of puzzles on the fingers of one hand." He found the non-interactive elements of the game to be insultingly poor as well, particularly that the story has no ending, only a teaser for a sequel. "Gamezilla" recommended the game only to fans of Alice Cooper, though cautioned that Cooper doesn't really have an impact until the very end. CDMag described it as a B level game. Techtite thought the game had the core design of "Myst", but with all the enjoyment stripped away. Four Fat Chicks felt that the game was an ego trip comparable to that of Queensryche's "Promised Land."

Glen Roy Conservation Park

Glen Roy Conservation Park (formerly Glen Roy National Park) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Glenroy about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north of the town of Penola.
The conservation park occupies land in sections 276, 279 and 479 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Comaum on the eastern side of the portion of the Riddoch Highway between Naracoorte in the north and Penola in the south. The following two adjoining sections have been excluded from the extent of the conservation park and thereby form indentations to its northern and southern boundaries – to the north, Section 389 was used in 1990 as a stone reserve by the then District Council of Penola for roadworks and to the south, Section 275 was used as a sand quarry.
It was proclaimed as a national park on 12 November 1970 under the "National Parks Act 1966" with the name, "Glen Roy National Park". On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the "Glen Roy Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. , it covered an area of .
In 1980, the conservation park's listing on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate argued it to be significant because it was a “remnant of open forest and seasonal swampland, displaying considerable diversity” and “provides important habitat for a wide range of species typical of the faunal assemblage of south-eastern South Australia.”
In 1990, the conservation park was described as consisting of three areas each with their own vegetation associations:
Fauna species observed within its boundaries as of 1990 included the red-tailed black cockatoo, the Yellow-footed antechinus and the common wombat.
As of 1990, visitation was described as “low” and that “most” of these visitors were “field naturalists.”
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Piano Concerto No. 6 (Ries)

The Piano Concerto No. 6 in C major, Op. 123, by Ferdinand Ries was composed around 1806. Composed in a proto-Romantic style, similar to the concertos of Johann Nepomuk Hummel, it also shows evidence of the influence of Beethoven's C minor Piano Concerto, Op. 37 which Ries had performed at his public debut in 1804.
Composition date.
The manuscript bears the notation "Bonn 1806", suggesting it was completed there. Allan Badley, in the notes to the Naxos recording comments that this would most likely make it the first of Ries's eight piano concertos to be written. Further evidence for this lies in the fact that this is the only piano concerto by Ries to provide for a cadenza at the end of the first movement, as was traditional. Publication, as the composers Op. 123 by firm of Sauer &amp; Leidesdorf did not take place until around 1823/24.
Structure.
The concerto follows the traditional three-movement structure:
Recordings.
To date the concerto has only been recorded once, by Uwe Grodd with the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra and soloist Christopher Hinterhuber, this was released by Naxos Records in conjunction with a publication of the score in a critical edition prepared by Allen Bradley.

Robert Bunch

Robert Bunch KCMG (born September 11, 1820, died March 21, 1881) was a British diplomat, who was a secret agent present in the United States South during the American Civil War. Before the outbreak of Civil War, he had served as a diplomatic representative, first in the North, and then replacing George Buckley-Mathew in Charleston, who was causing diplomatic problems. In particular, Mathew was vocally against South Carolina's recent rule of incarcerating British African sailors while in port.
Life.
Robert Bunch was from 1841 to 1845 attaché and private secretary of William Pitt Adams in Bogotá and Lima. In September 1844 he was sent together with Captain Sir Thomas Thompson as Joint Commissioner to the Supreme Junta of Government of Peru to Arequipa. On December 16, 1845 he was appointed Consular Agent in Lima. On February 6, 1846 he was appointed acting consul in Callao (Peru). Robert Bunch was vice-consul in New York City from October 25, 1848 to 1853. From 1853 to 1864, Bunch was consul in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1864 he became Consul General in Havana.[3] From 1866 to 1878 he served as Minister Resident and Consul General in Colombia. He then took on diplomatic posts in Venezuela and Peru. Robert Bunch had been married to Charlotte Amelia Craig since 1853. [4]
Family and early life.
Though Bunch was a diplomat and a spy for the British, he and his sister were actually born in America. The two were even baptized in New York's Trinity Church. However, he did all of his schooling in England and attended Oxford University. His mother's side was very well-connected, and respected as a prominent family who had close ties to the Roosevelt and Van Cortlandt families. In addition to this, his mother's lineage also includes Tories who spied for the British in the American Revolution and the War of 1812. [1]His first foreign service related job was as a secretary for the British envoy in Columbia, then in Peru. In 1848, he moved to New York City and began working his way up to diplomatic positions. He married Emma Craig, his first cousin, in 1853, just before coming to Charleston. [1]
Diplomacy in Charleston.
In 1853, Bunch worked at the office of British council in Charleston, then he served as the deputy consul in New York City, and then, the Foreign Office placed him in Philadelphia. Finally after much moving around, London had him trade positions with the consul in Charleston. In Charleston, the previous diplomat, George Buckley-Mathew, created disarray and confusion regarding the treatment of Negro-British sailors.[1] As a result, Bunch's main issue during his time as a diplomat was to fix Mathew's mess. At the time, most of the black seamen were free men. The law denied them from even entering the harbor because these seamen had so much influence on local slaves. If the seamen were caught, they were to be incarcerated, and sometimes killed. The white Southern slave owners feared that their slaves would be inspired to run away to freedom. The Southerners also despised Britain's policies regarding abolishing slavery, and Bunch strongly disagreed with the people south. From Charleston, Bunch was to supply the London Slave Trade Department with meticulous and detailed letters about any American's attempting to oppose Britain's policies in the Caribbean as well as the Atlantic.To do this, he became very close with the people from South Carolina so he was able to keep track of anything from cotton trade to quarantines. However, there was much more to his job.[1]
Secrecy in Charleston.
To the eyes of the Carolinians, Bunch only took reports of various items going out or coming into the port on ships, however, the main aspect of his diplomacy was a secret. Britain had consuls in most of the states in the United States. Bunch was included in the select few that worked in slave states. The overall purpose of his job was to keep Britain informed about the matters and affairs in the United States that would only be known by an insider.[1] Bunch had to find out about confidential information regarding politics and the military. However, the most important part was every detail they could find about slavery. Though Bunch was unsuccessful in modifying the Negro Slave Act, he was an asset to the British. Since he befriended many influential Southerners, like William Henry Trescot, he was able to provide the British with information about where slaves were being traded, if and where illegal slave trade was occurring, and the number of people being traded, sold, and much more.

Jim Dennistoun

James Robert Dennistoun (7 March 1883 – 9 August 1916) was a New Zealand mountaineer, explorer and airman in the First World War. He is known in particular as the first person to climb to the top of Mitre Peak / Rahotu.
Early life.
Dennistoun was born the middle of the three children of Emily (née Russell, 1856–1937) and George James Dennistoun (1847–1921) who farmed at Peel Forest Station which is located near the settlement of Peel Forest near Geraldine on the South Island of New Zealand. His siblings were older sister Barbara and younger brother George Hamilton Dennistoun (23 September 1884 – 16 June 1977).
Dennistoun attended the Collegiate School in Whanganui and later from 1894 to 1901, Malvern College in England. 
After he left school, he took up sheep farming, while his younger brother George eventually went into the navy. 
He bought a farm at Hawea in April 1910 but ended up selling it in September 1910. He then bought another farm near Lumsden, in the South Island.
Mountain climbing.
Attracted by the nearby mountains he became passionate about mountaineering, climbing Little Mount Peel at the age of 12, Big Mt Peel at the age of 14, Ben Nevis at 15, Ben Lomond at 16 and later a number of other of peaks in the Southern Alps including Mt Cook.
In 1908 he and 1905 All Black Eric Harper were the first to cross the 1899 m high pass in the Southern Alps that now bears his name.
In March 1910 with Jack Clarke and Lawrence Earle he made first ascent of the Mount D'Archiac in the Southern Alps.
Mitre Peak.
Undoubtedly his most famous climb, was the first known ascent of Mitre Peak / Rahotu.
While only 1692 metres high, the mountain rises almost sheer from Milford Sound and up until that time was considered to be unclimbable.
In 1911 Dennistoun walked in to Milford Sound from Lake Te Anau over Mackinnon Pass, and inquired among the track porters in the hope of finding someone to climb the peak with him. None of the porters had any climbing experience, but one of them, Joe Beaglehole (1875–1962), had read "Scrambles among the Alps" by noted climber Edward Whymper and was thus chosen by Dennistoun to accompany him.
During a sea voyage in the area with brother George in HMS Pioneer in 1909 Dennistoun had identified what he thought was a possible route but as he wasn't able to reconnoitre it he instead decided to take a route recommended by Donald Sutherland. Sunderland had in 1883 unsuccessfully attempted to climb the peak.
After rowing across in a boat to the mouth of Sinbad Gully at the base of the peak they starting climbing at 7.30am on 13 March 1911. Dennistoun and Beaglehole climbed via the south east-ridge through the bush until 300 metres short of the summit Beaglehole decided it was too difficult to continue and stopped. Dennistoun continued on alone up steep, smooth slabs of granite, to reach the summit at 1.15pm.
Descending back down Dennistoun rejoined Beaglehole and they continued with the descent. Unfortunately to avoid climbing back over the Footstool, they decided to descend straight into Sinbad Gully, which meant they had to resort to using a rope to lower themselves down bluffs. They eventually reached the valley floor in darkness, and it soon commenced to rain. With no camping equipment, they had no choice but to continue on until they reached the boat at 9.45pm, cold, wet and exhausted. They then rowed back across to spend the night at the hotel operated by Elizabeth Sunderland.
Dennistoun's claim to have reached the top was disputed by Donald Sutherland, who had bluntly claimed that Mitre Peak could not be climbed. In 1914 Dennistoun's handkerchief was found in a small cairn on the top of the peak by Jack Murrell (1886–1918) and Edger Williams (1891–1983) when they completed the second ascent of the peak.
When J.H. Christie and G. Raymond completed the third ascent in 1941, they found remains of the handkerchief, as well as two halfpennies left by Murrell and Williams.
Antarctica.
In 1911 Lieutenant Harry Pennell of the Royal Navy visited Peel Forest station. He was assigned to the research vessel Terra Nova. After having transported the Terra Nova Expedition (1910–1913 ) under the command of British polar explorer Robert Falcon Scott to Cape Evans on the Ross Island in the Antarctic, the ship was wintering over in New Zealand prior to returning with supplies for the expedition. Pennell mentioned that he wanted someone to take charge of the seven Himalayan mules donated by the Indian government which they would be carrying south to the expedition. The mules had arrived in September 1911 and were quarantined on Quail Island which is located 3 km from the port of Lyttelton.
Pennell could offer no pay, but the adventure was enough to attract Dennistoun and he signed up. While some clothing was provided, Dennistoun had to supply much of his own. As well as caring for the mules Dennistoun was also responsible for 14 Siberian dogs being transported south.
The Terra Nova arrived at Cape Evans on 22 February 1912. After offloading the mules and other supplies Dennistoun returned to New Zealand arriving on 1 April 1912. 
Instead of being used on a second attempt on the Pole the mules were used later that year to pull the sledges of the search party for Scott. The mules struggled in the harsh environment and all were eventually put down. 
For his services to the expedition he received the Polar Medal in silver and the medal of the Royal Geographical Society.
Return to farming.
He returned to his farm near Lumsden but eventually sold it in April 1914.
During an expedition in the Southern Alps in January1914 by Dennistoun, his brother George and Sydney King they discovered and named the Terra Nova Pass which overlooks the Havelock and Godley Valleys.
In July 1914 he bought yet another farm, this time at Mangamahu, near Whanganui, but his business partner hadn't seen it. When he did eventually see it, he didn't like it. In a panic, Dennistoun tried to get out of the deal as he risked being declared bankrupt and to his relief, he was able to find other partners.
World war I.
Following the outbreak of the First World War, Dennistoun travelled as a deckhand on a ship to England where he enlisted. By mid-May in 1915 he was commissioned as a 2nd lieutenant and had joined the North Irish Horse. Arriving in France with his squadron in November, he was immediately promoted to lieutenant. At first he served as an intelligence officer but after a few months was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps, joining the newly-arrived No.23 Squadron as an observer. Another member of the squadron was Dennistoun's cousin, pilot officer Herbert Bainbrigge (Herbie) Russell (1895–1963), and the pair were permitted to fly in the same plane.
Ten days later on 26 June 1916 Dennistoun was observer and bomb thrower in a FE2b biplane being piloted by his cousin, which departed with four other FE2bs on a bombing sortie against the Biache railway junction in Germany. Their aircraft encountered engine problems and they returned to base only for their commanding officer to demand that they take another airplane and continue with the raid. That aircraft was fitted with no bomb racks or sights so there was little chance of hitting the target. Dennistoun was instead instructed to instead throw the bombs over the side by the commanding officer. 
While flying alone they were attacked near Fampaux by three Fokker Eindeckers. While firing the rear gun Dennistoun was hit three times in the stomach and soon after the main fuel tank was hit and caught fire. Russell despite being shot in the shoulder was able to flatten the aircraft's dive out enough to crash landed near the German trenches, with both being thrown out by the impact with Russell severely burnt. They were captured. Dennistoun was taken to a hospital at nearby Hamblain where he had two operations and appeared to be on the way to recovery. One of the nurses, Lili Eidam, spoke English and wrote a letter dictated by Dennistoun to his mother.
The two airman were reunited at Biache and taken on 5 August to the hospital in the Ohrdruf prisoner of war camp in central Germany. On 9 August Dennistoun's condition deteriorated and he had a third operation. He survived the operation but soon after rapidly declined and he died at 12.05pm the same day.
Russell survived his injuries, was repatriated to England in 1918 and later attained the rank of Air Vice-Marshal in the RAF.
Dennistoun was first buried at Ohrdruf, before he was reburied after the war in the Niederzwehren Cemetery near Kassel.
Legacy.
Dennistoun Glacier in Ross Dependency is named after Dennistoun, as is New Zealand's Dennistoun Peak, which is located close to the headwaters of the Godley and Havelock Rivers in the Southern Alps. Nearby Dennistoun Pass and Dennistoun Glacier also bear his name. 
St Stephen's Church in Peel Forest has a stained glass window donated by Dennistoun's mother, Emily in 1923. It commemorates Dennistoun and his father George. The face of St Michael is a portrait of Dennistoun and in the bottom pane is a small representation of Mitre Peak.
In 1999, Guy Mannering of Geraldine, whose father, also named Guy, was a friend and climbing companion of Dennistoun, compiled and published "The Peaks and Passes of JRD", using letters, diaries, photographs and notebook entries held by the Dennistoun family through three generations.

Dorr Ranch

The Dorr Ranch was established by William and Mabel Dorr in 1910 in Converse County, Wyoming along Woody Creek. William had left home at the age of 8 or 9 and worked for the 71 Quarter Ranch and as a horse wrangler at Pony Express stations in Wyoming. He met Mabel McIntosh and married her in 1904. Mabel's parents had established the successful Hat Ranch near Split Rock and had significant resources to assist the young couple. The Dorrs filed for their first homestead in 1910 and expanded it in 1915, and again in 1917 and 1919, with a separate 1919 filing by Mabel. The Dorr's properties were not contiguous, and the present ranch house on Woody Creek was not built until 1915. In 1919 the Dorr School was built on the ranch. The same year the community of Bill was established, named after the shared name of four of the founders. The main ranch house was built in 1926–27. 
The Dorrs raised cattle and horses, running up to 700 horses for sale to the U.S. and Mexican armies. From about 1929 the property was leased and sold to a series of companies associated with the Dorrs, apparently to cover financial trouble. In 1939 the Dorrs moved to Miles City, Montana and the Morton family operated the ranch as part of their extensive holdings, using the Dorr ranch house as an overseers residence. 
The ranch was finally sold to the Mortons in 1947, part of a transaction.
Description.
The ranch includes the 1925 main house, two 1915 log cabins, a stable, corral, windmill, cistern and the site of the schoolhouse. The main house is a two-story frame house on a sandstone foundation, with nine rooms, measuring about by . One log cabin has two rooms, the other one. The windmill has a functioning Aeromotor. Other structures include a two-seat privy.
The Dorr Ranch was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in on December 22, 2014.

Michael Joseph Dooley (born 13 December 1961) is a New Zealand prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was appointed as the 7th Bishop of Dunedin, New Zealand on 22 February 2017, ordained bishop on 26 April 2018 and installed on 27 April 2018.
Dooley was born in Invercargill, the son of Joseph Dooley and Mary Hogan. He was educated at Heddon Bush Primary School and Central Southland College, Winton. He completed an apprenticeship as a fitter and turner before studying for a Bachelor of Theology at Otago University while he was at Holy Cross Seminary, then located at Mosgiel. He then completed a Master of Theology at Melbourne College of Divinity.
Dooley was an assistant priest at St. Mary's Basilica, Invercargill and at Gore. After completing his master's degree in theology in Melbourne, he was parish priest of Mosgiel where he was also Director at the Holy Cross Formation Centre. He then became Formator and Spiritual Director at Holy Cross Seminary in Auckland. On returning to Dunedin, he was again parish priest of Mosgiel and Green Island. He was appointed vicar general of the Dunedin diocese in 2016. On 22 February 2018, Dooley was appointed by Pope Francis to succeed Colin Campbell, on his retirement, as the 7th Bishop of Dunedin.
Dooley has said that he follows Pope Francis' views that instead of having a fortress mentality, it was better to engage with the world with a positive message of what the church may offer, like the gospel, to people in their everyday lives and to help the vulnerable in society and the poor which are "definitely what [Pope Francis] would want us to be more concerned about." Dooley has expressed his opposition to euthanasia.
Dooley was ordained Bishop at the Dunedin Town Hall on 26 April 2018 and installed the next day. The principal consecrator was his predecessor, Colin Campbell and the principal co-consecrators were Cardinal Dew and Archbishop Martin Krebs, the Apostolic Nuncio.

La Loche River (Ashuapmushuan River tributary)

The La Loche River is a tributary of the Ashuapmushuan River, flowing into the unorganized territory of Ashuapmushuan Lake, into the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada.
"La Loche River" flows in the townships of Le Ber, Cazeneuve, Mignault and Denault. The lower part of the river crosses the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The forest road R0203 (North-South direction) serves the lower part of the La Loche river valley; this road begins at the junction of route 167 which links Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec. Going up north, the R0203 road branches off to the northeast to reach the Hilarion River.
The surface of La Loche River is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
Formerly, this river has been designated "River aux Aulnes".
The toponym "La Loche River" was formalized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Kimberly Daniels

Kimberly Daniels (born 1961 or 1962) is an American minister, religious author, politician, and mother of four from Jacksonville, Florida. She served on the Jacksonville City Council and as the representative for Florida House of Representatives District 14 (part of Duval County) as a member of the Democratic Party. She lost renomination to the House in 2020.
Personal life.
Daniels is a graduate of Florida State University where she obtained a bachelor's degree in Criminology. Daniels has a master's degree in Christian Education and a Doctorate in Christian Counseling from the unaccredited Jacksonville Theological Seminary. Daniels' book "Breaking the Power of Familiar Spirits" is now a class textbook at JTS.
Daniels has expressed thankfulness to God for slavery and for her time in a crackhouse (she is a self-described former sex worker and drug addict), which she saw as ultimately leading to her religious conversion: "If it wasn’t for slavery, I might be somewhere in Africa worshipping a tree." Daniels also said, "You can talk about the Holocaust, but the Jews own everything."
In 2011 Daniels was elected to the Jacksonville City Council as an at-large member. On March 9, 2015, then-City Councilwoman Daniels was involved in a profanity-laced squabble with council candidate Sirretta Williams, also a local minister. She lost her bid for re-election in 2015, 55% to 45%. Her Republican opponent received support from LGBT groups and white liberals due to Daniels' controversial views and financial problems.
Daniels and her husband Ardell were divorced in 2015/6.
Florida House of Representatives.
Daniels was first nominated to the House in 2016 (incumbent Mia L. Jones could not run due to term limits), winning the Democratic nomination with 6781 votes (35.99% of the vote) in the primary election, defeating attorney Leslie Jean-Bart (31.32%) and three other candidates. In the general election she easily defeated Republican nominee Christian Whitfield, taking just over two-thirds of the vote.
In March 2017, it was reported that Daniels was under investigation by the Florida Elections Commission after it found probable cause that she used campaign funds for personal expenses and later falsely reported information on finance reports.
In early 2018, Daniels introduced HB 839, a bill that requires public schools to display the motto "In God We Trust" in a conspicuous place. On Tuesday, January 23, 2018, the bill received unanimous approval from the House PreK-12 Innovation Subcommittee. Later, in a vote on February 21, 2018, the bill passed 97 to 10 in the House. The measure was eventually adopted as law in March 2019 as part of an education bill.
On August 28, 2018, Daniels defeated educator Paula Wright in the Democratic primary for her seat. She did not have a Republican opponent, and conspicuously drew campaign support from Republican officeholders and donors.
In early 2019, Daniels sponsored legislation to require schools to teach courses on the Bible. The Florida House PreK-12 Quality Subcommittee approved the measure.
Daniels championed a $1 million-dollar contract for SCLC World Wide, run by Reverend Gary Johnson. In the summer of 2019, Florida Department of Juvenile Justice sued SCLC World Wide for not delivering on its commitments. The following day, Daniels was sued by a former staffer, Karen Riggien, who claimed to have been wrongfully fired in February 2018 in connection with interactions with Gary Johnson, a man Riggien described as Daniels' boyfriend.
On July 23, 2019, the Freedom from Religion Foundation wrote to Representative Daniels requesting that she stop blocking users on Facebook.
On August 18, 2020, Daniels lost renomination in the Democratic primary election to Angie Nixon.

Doundou Chefou

Ibrahim Doundou Chefou is a Nigerien militant and a mid-level commander in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara. Code named "Naylor Road" by the United States.
Background.
Chefou is believed to have the led the ambush of a convoy of U.S. and Nigerien troops in October 2017 that left four American and five Nigerien soldiers dead. Formerly a Fulani herder in the Niger-Mali border region, he initially took up arms to battle Tuareg cattle thieves. According to "The New York Times", U.S. troops were attempting to locate Chefou in October 2017 when at least fifty militants purportedly led by him attacked them near the village of Tongo Tongo in southwestern Niger.
Chefou is believed by African officials to be one of the main propagators of unrest in the Sahel region. Niger's defense minister labeled him a "terrorist" and a "bandit."

1942 Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football team

The 1942 Iowa Pre-Flight Seahawks football team represented the United States Navy pre-flight aviation training school at the University of Iowa as an independent during the 1942 college football season. The team compiled a 7–3 record and outscored opponents by a total of 211 to 121. The 1942 team was known for its difficult schedule, including Notre Dame, Michigan, Ohio State, Minnesota, Indiana, Nebraska, and Missouri. The team was ranked No. 2 among the service teams in a poll of 91 sports writers conducted by the Associated Press.
The Navy's pre-flight aviation training school opened on April 15, 1942, with a 27-minute ceremony during which Iowa Governor George A. Wilson turned over certain facilities at the University of Iowa to be used for the training of naval aviators. At the time, Wilson said, "We are glad it is possible to place the facilities of this university and all the force and power of the state of Iowa in a service that is today most vital to safeguarding our liberties." The first group of 600 air cadets was scheduled to arrive on May 28.
Bernie Bierman, then holding the rank of major, was placed in charge of the physical conditioning program at the school. Bieman had been the head coach of Minnesota from 1932 to 1941 and served as the head coach of the Iowa Pre-Flight team in 1942. Larry Snyder, previously the track coach at Ohio State, was assigned as Bierman's assistant. Don Heap, Dallas Ward, Babe LeVoir, and Trevor Reese were assigned as assistant coaches for the football team.
In June 1942, Bierman addressed the "misconception" that the Iowa pre-flight school was "merely a place for varsity athletics." He said: "Our purpose here is to turn out the toughest bunch of flyers the world has ever seen and not first class athletes."
Two Seahawks were named to the 1942 All-Navy All-America football team: George Svendsen at center and Dick Fisher at left halfback. In addition, Bill Kolens (right tackle), Judd Ringer (right end), George Benson (quarterback), and Bill Schatzer (left halfback) were named to the 1942 All-Navy Preflight Cadet All-America team.

The Titan (film)

The Titan is a 2018 science fiction thriller film directed by Lennart Ruff and starring Sam Worthington, Taylor Schilling and Tom Wilkinson. The screenplay was written by Max Hurwitz, with the story by Arash Amel. The film is an international co-production between the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, and Spain.
"The Titan" was released for some countries by Netflix on March 30, 2018. It was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on April 13, 2018, by Signature Entertainment, and direct to video in Germany on May 8, 2018, by EuroVideo.
Plot.
In 2048, on an Earth overpopulated and driven by violent conflicts, scientists are looking to Saturn's moon Titan as a new home for humanity, spearheaded by Professor Martin Collingwood.
Rick Janssen, a fighter pilot, volunteers to be a part of an experiment on 14 test subjects that forces human bodies to adapt to the super-cold methane liquids and the ultra-low oxygen atmosphere of Titan. He is joined by his wife Abigail, a medical researcher, and their son Lucas, at the Titan I research area. The initial results are promising. Rick becomes able to swim at incredible speeds and stay underwater for 42 minutes.
Rick's training becomes increasingly intense as he and the others adapt to increasingly Titan-like environments. Rick finds that some of his hair is falling out, and one of the team members starts convulsing and dies. Abigail notices the blood veins of all the test subjects becoming darker. Fellow volunteer Zane has a mental breakdown which causes him to attack his wife, Rayenne.
Rick takes a break by sitting at the bottom of their swimming pool, where large amounts of his skin are shed. Abigail's concern grows, and she begins experimentation on a sample of his blood, finding that it is indeed becoming darker. Rick undergoes corneal surgery to accommodate the low light on Titan. When he later has complications, Abigail confronts Collingwood about Rick's changes, but he divulges nothing.
Zane suffers another mental breakdown and throws Rayenne through a window, killing her instantly. He is shot and killed by military police. While visiting Rick in the medical facility, Abigail steals his key card and sneaks into Collingwood's office. She finds reports of autopsies of the numerous deceased test subjects, discovering that they were having their DNA infused with animal DNA in an attempt to create the next human species, "Homo titaniens".
During a meeting with NASA, Collingwood is chastised for doing forced evolutionary experimentation without proper evidence or ethical reasons, and is threatened with having his operation shut down. Abigail confronts him on the same issue, and he admits to her and Rick that he does not actually know what the surviving subjects will eventually become.
Rick willingly undergoes major surgery to adapt to his new senses and become fully ready for Titan. He and Tally, the only other surviving test subject, complete their training and finish their transformations into "Homo titaniens". Abigail is horrified when the significantly-transformed Rick loses the ability to talk, now communicating in a low frequency that is undetectable by normal human ears.
Tally kills her husband, later visiting Rick at his home. Abigail and Lucas hide while military police surround Tally and Rick. Tally kills a member of the police before she is killed, and then Rick easily kills many more. When Abigail and Lucas confront him, Rick flees, realizing what he has become. The military hunt for Rick, but it is Abigail who finds him on a hill they often jog to. The military arrives and arrests them.
Abigail wakes to find Rick in critical condition, due to his newly evolved incompatibility with Earth's atmosphere. Abigail is forced to give him a chemical solution that acts similarly to a lobotomy, erasing all of his memories. However, she actually gives him a harmless saline solution instead, allowing him to escape. Rick begins killing soldiers as Abigail and Lucas flee with Dr. Freya Upton, an assistant to Collingwood who disagrees with his methods.
The group find a heavily wounded Rick before they give him first aid. Collingwood arrives but his men disobey an order to fire upon Rick, Abigail, Lucas and Dr. Freya. The colonel, who has been vocally against Collingwood's experiments, soon arrests Collingwood for his treachery. Abigail and Dr. Freya become researchers at the Titan II facility, using more ethical methods than Collingwood had. Rick is shown exploring Titan, flying under his own power over a methane lake.
Production.
In August 2015, Sam Worthington, Ruth Wilson and Sofia Boutella signed on to star in the film to be directed by Lennart Ruff. Voltage Pictures would handle international rights sales while CAA would handle domestic sales. Producer Arash Amel spoke of his enthusiasm for the project:
In October 2015, Tom Wilkinson joined the cast with Voltage Pictures planning to sell international rights to the film at the 2016 American Film Market. In December 2015, Taylor Schilling signed on to replace Wilson, who, alongside Boutella, dropped out of the film. In January 2016, Diego Boneta, Aleksander Jovanovic and Agyness Deyn joined the cast. In February 2016, at AFM, Voltage Pictures managed to sell international distribution rights in multiple countries. However, in February 2018, it was reported that Netflix had picked up worldwide distribution rights to the film. The film has also been released on Blu-ray in several European countries including the United Kingdom. Principal production was slated to commence on January 18, 2016, in Europe but was pushed back to February 1, 2016, where shooting began in Gran Canaria.
Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18%, based on 28 reviews, and an average rating of 3.7/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 33 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".
Jake Nevins from "The Guardian" gave the film only one out of five stars, criticizing its script and Worthington's performance: 
Matt Fowler from IGN gave the film 5 out of 10: 
David Ehrlich from "IndieWire" also gave the film a negative review:

Ludvig Munthe (bishop)

Ludvig Hanssøn Munthe (August 2, 1593 – December 3, 1649) was the Bishop of the Diocese of Bjørgvin from 1636 to 1649. 
Life and work.
Munthe was born in Tikøb, Denmark. He was the son of the parish priest Hans Ludvigssøn Munthe (1560–1601) and Anne Catharina de Fine (1566–1601). Munthe came from a family of priests. Both of his parents died from the plague in 1601, and Ludvig was educated at his uncle's residence in Lund.
In 1613 he was admitted to the University of Copenhagen, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1616 and master's degree in 1619. He became a teacher at Lund Cathedral School in 1616, but resigned shortly after to privately teach several of the sons of the nobleman Otto Lindenov. This involved two long trips abroad. He spent six years at German universities and became familiar with contemporary theological and religious orientations.
In 1624 he was appointed parish priest at Nordre Borreby in Scania, and in 1634 senior court priest ("hoffpredikant") at the court for King Christian IV.
In 1636, Munthe was named Bishop of Bergen and he arrived in the town in March 1637. He was the first member of the Munthe family to arrive in Norway, when he took the office of his diocese. As bishop, he worked intensely to develop schooling and popular education through the liturgy and religious life. After the town fire of 1640, he rebuilt Bergen Cathedral School and expanded preaching and teaching activities.
Bishop Munthe published an exposition of the catechism in 1644. Munthe's views represented the widespread Lutheran orthodoxy of his time. Some of his effort was directed against "pagan and papist customs" in the form of carnival customs and processions. He criticized popular customs, including the use of images of the saints and the pilgrimage to Røldal.
Family and descendants.
In 1624, Munthe married Ingeborg Sørensdatter Friis, daughter of the court scribe Søren Friis. They were the parents of twelve children.
Munthe died at Bergen in 1649; his wife died in 1654.
Munthe's daughter Elisabeth Munthe ( 1630 – c. 1649) was the wife of Christen Paus, mayor of Bergen. His daughter Birgitte Munthe (1634–1708) married Christopher Morgenstierne (1619–1679).
His daughter Abel Munthe (1628–1676), who was married to university professor Peder Lem (1617–1663), was the grandmother of Ludvig Holberg.

Robert H. Mohlenbrock

Dr. Robert H. Mohlenbrock (born September 26, 1931) is an American botanist and author. He is an authority on the plants of Illinois, with expertise in floristics, plant taxonomy, endangered species, and wetland flora.
Early life and education.
Mohlenbrock began his studies of the flora of southern Illinois at an early age. During childhood walks in the woods and along the banks of the Big Muddy River, he recalls mentally noting the diverse flora and fauna around Murphysboro, Illinois. He names his greatest influence to be his high school biology teacher, Esther Smith. At Murphysboro High School, Smith led excursions to high quality natural areas and encouraged her students to work on natural history projects that yielded valuable contributions to the knowledge of Illinois flora and fauna. Mohlenbrock has described her as "a dedicated soul, a serious scientist who would provide for those who were serious." Mohlenbrock's first project was presented at a 1948 science fair, called "Field Survey of Trees" of southern Illinois, completed with Kenneth Stewart. At least 7 students in Smith's classes, including Mohlenbrock and Kenneth Stewart, went on to attain PhDs in biology.
Mohlenbrock received both his bachelor's and master's degrees from Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIU). As a master's student under John W. Voigt, he completed his thesis on "The vegetation of Giant City State Park: a floristic and ecological study" in 1954. Between 1956 and 1957, Mohlenbrock was briefly a research chemist for Pressite Engineering Co. in St. Louis, Missouri. He completed his PhD in 1957 at Washington University. His PhD thesis was titled "A revision of the genus "Stylosanthes"" (a genus in the legume family).
Career.
Soon following the completion of his PhD work, Mohlenbrock was hired at Southern Illinois University Carbondale to fill in for a single quarter for a faculty member who had taken an unexpected leave. The faculty member never returned, launching Mohlenbrock's long career as a botanist at SIU. He stayed at SIU for 33 years until his retirement in 1990, having served as chair of the botany department for 16 years. He was also curator of the SIU herbarium between 1960-1965. Mohlenbrock's department at SIU provided one of the few places in the country that encouraged students to conduct floristic studies in pursuit of a PhD. Mohlenbrock advised 90 graduate students during his tenure at SIU and has received numerous awards in recognition of his instruction. In 1985 he was named Chairman of the North American Plant Specialists Group of the Species Survival Commission of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, a position he held for 15 years. He is the author of 69 books about plants.
Mohlenbrock has consulted for many organizations including the Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Illinois Nature Preserves Commission, and U.S. Forest Service. Since retirement, he has continued to teach wetland plant identification and other courses throughout the United States under his consulting company, Biotic Consultants (in partnership with his wife, Beverly A. Mohlenbrock). He has taught 328 of these week-long wetland plant classes in 32 states.
Legacy.
In the 1960s and 70s, Mohlenbrock and Voigt continued their studies of southern Illinois to develop a conservation program for its natural areas. Through their surveys, they found that all of the bald cypress swamps in the area, with the exception of Horseshoe Lake, were privately owned. The land was primarily owned by a lumber company called Main Brothers, which had only left the land unlogged because the water had been too deep to drain. Partnerships between the state of Illinois, the Natural Land Institute of Rockford, and the Illinois chapter of the Nature Conservancy led to the purchase and protection of many of these remnant areas. The protected areas include Heron Pond – Little Black Slough Nature Preserve, a designated National Natural Landmark and wetland of international importance.
In 1982, with his son Mark W. Mohlenbrock, he co-founded the Southern Illinois Native Plant Society, an organization dedicated to "the preservation, conservation, and study of the native plants and vegetation of Southern Illinois." In 1986, it expanded to become a state-wide organization, now known as the Illinois Native Plant Society, with 7 active chapters, including the Southern Chapter.
Selected publications.
Mohlenbrock has published numerous technical reports as well as articles in popular magazines such as Outdoor Illinois and a regular column in Natural History magazine called "This Land" since 1984. Below is a selected listing of his published books.

2018 Lashio bombing

The 2018 Lashio bombing was a bomb blast in the town of Lashio, in northern Shan State, Myanmar, that killed two employees of Yoma Bank and injured 22 others.
Background.
Bombings are not uncommon in Shan State, where there is an ongoing conflict between the government of Myanmar and various insurgent groups. However, bombings tend to be small-scale and civilian casualties are rare.
Bombing.
At around 4:30 pm (MMT) on 21 February 2018, a bomb exploded between two banks, Yoma Bank and Aya Bank, immediately killing two employees of the former. Twenty-two others were injured in the blast.
Aftermath.
On 23 February 2018, the government of Shan State announced it would compensate victims of the bombing, offering 500,000 kyats ($375 USD) to the families of the two deceased and 200,000 to 300,000 kyats to those injured.

Steel industry in Nigeria

Iron and steel industry in Nigeria developed as a public funded integral industry. Between 1979 and 1983, Nigeria government jump started iron and steel production with emphasis on the importance of iron and steel in developing and driving local production of goods. A strong iron and steel industry was also projected to reduce demand of foreign currency used towards the importation of steel products.
History.
The iron and steel industry in Nigeria started by government intervention through the construction of various steel rolling mills. After iron ore deposits were discovered in old Kwara State in the 1950s, the Nigerian First Republic government began active planning and mapping of strategies for local production of iron rods and steel. However, many proposals presented by foreign companies were less enthused on steel production due to concerns about local technical know how and market demand. But in 1967, a technical group from the Soviet Union proposed the use of direct blast furnace process as a viable method of production in the country. Further exploration of iron ore deposits by Soviet firm Technopromexport yielded commercial quantities around the Itakpe region of present Kogi State. In 1971, a Nigeria steel development authority was created to design plans for iron and steel projects and train students in iron and steel making.
In 1979, the Nigerian government signed an agreement with soviet group Technopromexport for the construction of a steel plant in Ajaokuta.
Steel making infrastructure reached an advanced stage in 1982 with the commissioning of Aladja Steel complex, the first phase was built at a total cost of 922 million naira. The factory's process utilized electric arc furnace steel making technology. The mill was planned to produce finished billets more than it could process into wire or iron rods. The remainder of the billets were distributed to three rolling mills in Jos, Osogbo, Katsina, these mills then produced rods between 6mm and 40mm. The production capacity of the rollings mills were divided into phases, the first phase with an estimated hourly production of 80 tonnes of finished products was 210,000 tonnes per year, a second phase projected a production rate of 420,000 tonnes per year and a final phase production of 720,000 tonnes per year
Katsina rolling mills.
Katsina rolling mills was constructed by Kobe Steel of Japan. One of the Nigerian project coordinators was Mahmud Kanti Bello who later became a senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Upon completion, the country agreed to a 36 months technical assistance programme with Kobe to train Nigerian employees. The mill produced plain and ribbed rods between 6mm to 40mm in diameter and the finished products were primarily associated with wire industries.
Jos steel rolling mill.
The rolling mill in Jos was constructed by a consortium of German firms; Mannesmann Demag, AEG Telefunken, Ofenbau Union and Bilfinger + Berger.
Osogbo steel rolling mill.
The mill was commissioned on April 30, 1983. The construction phase was handled by a consortium of Eisenbau Essen, Schloemann Siemag, Strabag and MFB Ferrostal. The government and the builders signed a technical assistance programme to train workers who will later takeover daily operations of the mill. The steel mill complex also had housing facilities for select worker within the complex.

Superfly (2018 film)

Superfly is a 2018 American action crime thriller film and a remake of the 1972 blaxploitation film "Super Fly". The film was directed by Director X, written by Alex Tse and stars Trevor Jackson, Jason Mitchell, Michael K. Williams, Lex Scott Davis, and Jennifer Morrison. Rapper Future produced alongside Joel Silver, as well as writing the film's original songs.
"Superfly" was released in the United States on June 13, 2018 and received mixed reviews from critics, who praised the movie's style but ultimately found a lack of substance.
Plot.
Youngblood Priest is a young Atlanta cocaine kingpin, working the streets since he was brought in by his mentor Scatter at age eleven. He lives with his two girlfriends, Georgia and Cynthia.
Juju, a member of rival gang Snow Patrol, hits on Cynthia and, shooting at Priest, accidentally hits a bystander. The Snow Patrol members leave while Priest gives the victim money and directs them to the trauma center.
Priest confides in his second-in-command Eddie that he wants out of drug-dealing, and has a plan. Eddie has his back but Scatter refuses to help. Juju suspects Priest of a hit on Snow Patrol and plans to retaliate. Snow Patrol deduces that Priest's colleague, Fat Freddie, was one of the assailants.
Fat Freddie is pulled over by corrupt cops Franklin and Mason. They discovers cocaine and find Eddie in Freddie's contacts. With Mason's gun at Freddie's head, Freddie's girlfriend reveals his criminal history and Priest's identity. Franklin kills Freddie and Rochelle.
Mason threatens to expose Priest's dealing if he does not work with her. Fighting over recriminations about Freddie's death, Priest leaves Eddie unconscious. Scatter surprises Priest at Freddie's funeral, ordering him to meet with his supplier Adalberto, after finding out Priest cut a secret deal for more product. Adalberto kills Scatter, having realized he was stealing from him. Adalberto threatens Priest, telling him that he can never get out of the game.
Snow Patrol members led by Juju shoot up Priest's mansion. Cynthia is killed, and Priest and Georgia set fire to the mansion. Chasing Priest, Juju is injured and Q is killed in a car crash. Eddie feigns allegiance with Snow Patrol, and tricks them into an ambush where they are killed by Mason and other cops alerted by Priest.
Priest thanks Eddie for his help and prepares to leave the country with Georgia. He blackmails the mayor with a sex tape and promises the mayor will win the upcoming election. Adalberto is executed at his mother's order after she receives proof that he framed his brother for a crime. Instead of paying off Mason, Priest tips off police and she is arrested for cocaine possession.
Priest meets Franklin and beats him to avenge Freddie's murder. Having settled his business obligations, and with his enemies either dead or in custody, Priest and Georgia relax on a cruise in Montenegro.
Production.
Production began in December 2017, with Future announcing the project and confirming Director X as director. Principal photography started in Atlanta, Georgia in January 2018. Filming wrapped in March 2018, a process that "Deadline Hollywood" called an "unprecedented turnaround".
While Sony and other publications reported the film was made on a net production budget of $16 million, "Deadline" stated their sources insisted the actual cost was "well north of $20 [million], near $30 [million]". The site compared the situation to "Proud Mary", a film released in January 2018 that Sony reported cost $14 million to make but other sources listed at as high as $30 million.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack for the film was curated by American rapper Future, who also acted as a producer on the film. It features 13 new and previously released songs, as well as guest appearances from Miguel, Lil Wayne, Khalid, Ty Dolla Sign, Young Thug, PartyNextDoor, H.E.R., Gunna, Sleepy Brown, and Yung Bans, among others.
Release.
"Superfly" was initially scheduled to be released on June 15, 2018. Three weeks prior, it was moved up two days to June 13, 2018, in order to avoid direct competition with "Incredibles 2".
The film was released on digital and iTunes on August 28, 2018 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. It was released on Blu-Ray and DVD on 11 September 2018.
Reception.
Box office.
In the United States and Canada, "Superfly" was projected to gross $7–12 million from 2,200 theaters over its five-day opening weekend. The film made $1.2 million on its first day, $938,583 on its second and $1.8 million on its third. It ended up grossing $6.9 million in its opening weekend (a five-day total of $9 million), finishing sixth at the box office. It dropped to $3.4 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth, and after being pulled from 1,064 theaters in its third week made $1.3 million, finishing 12th.
Critical response.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 50% based on 101 reviews, and an average rating of 5.29/10. The website's critical consensus reads, ""Superfly" updates the blaxploitation original with a stylish remake that's exciting and visually arresting enough to offer its own slickly staged action rewards, but disappointingly short on social subtext." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 68% overall positive score.
"Variety"s Owen Gleiberman wrote: "Shot in a functional, slammed-together manner that's less sensually stylish than you'd expect from a music-video auteur, the film is a competent yet glossy and hermetic street-hustle drug thriller, less a new urban myth than a lavishly concocted episode. It holds your attention yet leaves you with nothing."

Oreoleptidae

Oreoleptidae is a family of flies (insects in the order Diptera). The family was established in 2005 on the basis of the type species Oreoleptis torrenticola placed in the monotypic genus Oreoleptis. The only known species was collected from the Rocky Mountains where the larvae grow in torrential streams. Larvae have also been found in groundwater wells. The larvae are similar to those of Athericidae and Tabanidae but with long crocheted false-legs (prolegs) arising from abdominal segments 2-7. The larvae have hollow mandibular hooks.
The aberrant larvae had been collected in the past in the United States and considered as Athericids but entomologists had been unable to identify the adult stage until 2005 when adults were reared from larvae. The adults were found very similar to Pelecorhynchidae when identifying using the key in McAlpine's 1981 "Manual of Nearctic Diptera" but they stand apart due to the aedeagal tines and other male reproductive parts which indicate a clear similarity to the Athericidae and Tabanidae. The adults are dull grey with stylate antennae. The wing has cell r1 open.
The name is said to be derived from Greek "oreos" (mountain) and "leptos" (thin, delicate). The proper word for "mountain" is "oros" (ὄρος) in ancient Greek.

Discuba

Discuba is a Cuban record label founded in 1959 by RCA Victor. It released music by several internationally successful artists such as Beny Moré, Orquesta Aragón and La Lupe. Following the end of the Cuban Revolution and the nationalization of the music industry by the Cuban government in 1961, Discuba relocated to Hialeah, Florida, as did many Cuban independent labels. Since the late 1980s the label has mostly reissued its back catalogue, now headquartered in North Bergen, New Jersey.
History.
Victor began its operations in Cuba in 1904 in collaboration with the Spanish-Cuban company Humara y Lastra, originally a pottery business. Headquartered in Havana's Muralla Street, Humara was in charge of the manufacture, distribution and A&amp;R of Victor's Cuban operations. For over 30 years Victor's only competition in Cuba were other major labels such as Columbia. In 1935, some of Victor's old recording equipment was purchased by the CMQ Radio Station, and in 1937 they were taken over by the new Radio Cadena Suaritos, as CMQ moved location. This marked the beginning of independent recording in Cuba, although such radio material was generally not in circulation. In the 1940s, with the emergence of Panart, the Cuban music industry began a shift that peaked in the late 1950s with the appearance of numerous independent record labels such as Puchito, Kubaney and Maype. Facing such competition, RCA Victor decided to create a new label to consolidate its Cuban operations. Thus Discuba was created, under the direction of Jesús Humara, and with Eliseo Valdés serving as A&amp;R manager; both had been involved with Victor for many years. The establishment of Discuba was part of larger strategy to strengthen RCA Victor's position in the Latin American market, which included multiple manufacturing deals in Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Colombia, Ecuador, Jamaica, and Trinidad.
On May 29, 1961, Discuba was forced to relocate to the United States following the nationalization of the Cuban record industry by Fidel Castro's government and the transfer of its assets to the Imprenta Nacional de Cuba (INC). Between 1961 and 1964, the INC was responsible for manufacturing and distributing already recorded albums by Discuba, Puchito, Panart and Gema. Discuba continued its operations stateside, although its number of yearly releases dropped over the course of the 1960s. In 1963, the newly established Real label began issuing Discuba's LPs in Colombia.
Roster.
From its inception, Discuba's roster featured several high-profile Cuban acts, such as Beny Moré, Pacho Alonso, Orquesta Aragón and Felipe Dulzaide's group. The latter served as the backing band for La Lupe's first recordings, released by Discuba under the title "Con el diablo en el cuerpo". Moré came into the label already as an "RCA-exclusive artist", and continued his previous success obtaining a Golden Record for his guaracha "Se te cayó el tabacó" in 1961.

<doc id="56672611" url="?curid=56672611" title="List of pinnipeds">
List of pinnipeds

Pinnipedia is an infraorder of mammals in the order Carnivora, composed of seals, sea lions, and the walrus. A member of this group is called a pinniped or a seal. They are widespread throughout the ocean and some larger lakes, primarily in colder waters. Pinnipeds range in size from the and Baikal seal to the and male southern elephant seal, which is also the largest member of Carnivora. Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism, such as the southern elephant seal, where the males can be more than three times as long and six times as massive as the females, or the Ross seal, which has females typically larger than the males. Four seal species are estimated to have over one million members, while seven are classified as endangered with population counts as low as 300, and two, the Caribbean monk seal and the Japanese sea lion, went extinct in the 20th century.
The 34 extant species of Pinnipedia are split into 22 genera within 3 families: Odobenidae, comprising the walrus; Otariidae, the eared seals, split between the sea lions and fur seals; and Phocidae, the earless or true seals. Odobenidae and Otariidae are combined into the superfamily Otarioidea, with Phocidae in Phocoidea. Extinct species have also been placed into the three extant families, as well as the extinct family Desmatophocidae, though most extinct species have not been categorized into a subfamily. Nearly one hundred extinct Pinnipedia species have been discovered, though due to ongoing research and discoveries the exact number and categorization is not fixed.
Conventions.
Conservation status codes listed follow the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species. Range maps are provided wherever possible; if a range map is not available, a description of the pinniped's range is provided. Ranges are based on the IUCN red list for that species unless otherwise noted. All extinct species or subspecies listed alongside extant species went extinct after 1500 CE, and are indicated by a dagger symbol "".
Classification.
The infraorder Pinnipedia consists of 3 families containing 34 extant species belonging to 22 genera and divided into 48 extant subspecies, as well the extinct Caribbean monk seal and Japanese sea lion species, which are the only pinniped species to go extinct since prehistoric times. This does not include hybrid species or extinct prehistoric species.
Pinnipeds.
The following classification is based on the taxonomy described by "Mammal Species of the World" (2005), with augmentation by generally accepted proposals made since using molecular phylogenetic analysis. This includes splitting the monk seal genus "Monachus" into "Monachus" and "Neomonachus", the reorganization of grey seal subspecies, and the removal of the Laptev walrus subspecies.
Prehistoric pinnipeds.
In addition to extant pinnipeds, many prehistoric species have been classified as a part of Pinnipedia. Morphogenic and molecular phylogenic research has placed them within the extant families as well as the extinct families Desmatophocidae and Panotariidae within the Otarioidea superfamily. Within Pinnipedia, prehistoric species have been placed into both extant genera and separate extinct genera. The list of fossil taxa is primarily based on the historiographical data from Valenzuela-Toro and Pyenson (2019), itself largely based on data from the Paleobiology Database, unless otherwise cited. Where available, the approximate time period for the species is given in millions of years before the present (Mya), also based on data from the Paleobiology Database. All listed species are extinct; where a genus or family within Pinnipedia comprises only extinct species, it is indicated with a dagger symbol .

Richard Caples

Richard Robert Caples (December 23, 1921 – April 28, 2002) was an American politician who served as Massachusetts public safety commissioner.
Early life.
Caples was born on December 23, 1921 in Boston. He attended the Brighton High School, Princeton University, and the Boston University School of Law. He served in the United States Navy during World War II and was a member of the Naval Reserve for 27 years.
Political career.
Caples was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives from 1951 to 1959 and the Massachusetts Senate from 1959 to 1963. He then served as a legislative aide to Massachusetts Governor Endicott Peabody.
Public safety Commissioner.
Peabody lost his reelection bid in 1964 and spent his final days appointing aides to government positions. Peabody had until December 31 to legally make an appointment that could not be recalled by his successor, but due to Christmas break, this deadline was pushed to midnight on December 23. Men who held Caples position were usually appointed to judgeships, however there were no vacancies available. On December 22, it was announced that public safety commissioner Robert W. MacDonald had resigned and Caples would succeed him. Caples and his family arrived at the Governor's office for his swearing in, however, MacDonald showed up and announced that he never intended to resign. MacDonald's wife, however, convinced her husband to return to his law practice and at 11:35 pm on December 22, Caples was sworn in.
Caples appointment was to fill the unexpired term of Frank S. Giles, who had been suspended since his indictment on charges of conspiracy, larceny, aiding and abetting in making false reports, and conflict of interest. However, Giles resigned on September 27, 1965 and Governor John A. Volpe appointed Leo L. Laughlin to succeed him. Caples claimed that he could not legally be replaced until the expiration of Giles' term on July 20, 1966 and refused to give up his office. Laughlin instead took a temporary office in the agency's headquarters while Caples pursued legal action. On September 30, 1965, Suffolk County Superior Court Judge Harry T. Kalus refused to issue an injunction to prevent the Secretary of the Commonwealth from issuing Laughlin's commission and Laughlin moved into the commissioner's office. Kalus later ruled that Laughlin was "the legally and duly qualified Commissioner of Public Safety". His decision was affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.
Later career.
Caples practiced law in Boston for many years and during the 1970s also served as an assistant attorney general under Robert H. Quinn. He later retired to Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, where he worked as a real estate broker.
Caples died on April 28, 2002 in Lebanon, New Hampshire.

Piano Concerto No. 8 (Ries)

The Piano Concerto No. 8 in A-flat major, Op. 151 "Gruss an den Rhein" () (), by Ferdinand Ries was composed around 1826 and published in 1829 by Simrock. While still showing the structural influence of Beethoven's piano concertos, the writing for the piano is more akin to that of later composers such as Chopin, Mendelssohn &amp; Schumann.
Composition history.
Ries composed this work in 1826, some two years after his return from England and approximately two years after the publication of the last of his early piano concerti (Opp. 123 &amp; 132). Allan Badley comments that this would most likely make it the seventh of Ries's eight piano concertos to be written. As he was no longer an active concert pianist publication by N. Simrock, bearing a dedication to Godefroi Weber followed within a year.
Structure.
The concerto follows the traditional three-movement structure:
A typical performance of the work lasts around 28 to 30 minutes.

Frances Baker

Frances Baker (3 May 1873 — 14 November 1944), also known professionally as Frances Cahill, was a British painter who was active in Ireland in the early years of the 20th century.
Biography.
Frances Baker ("née" Davies-Colley) was born into a prominent family of medical professionals: her father, John Neville Davies-Colley, was chief surgeon at Guy's Hospital, London, her brothers, Robert Davies-Colley and Hugh Davies-Colley, also became surgeons at Guy's, and her sister, Eleanor Davies-Colley, was the founder of the South London Hospital for Women and Children and the first woman elected to the Royal College of Surgeons. 
Frances, the eldest child, studied at the Slade School of Art, taking a certificate in figure drawing in the 1894-95 session. She married Cecil Cautley Baker in 1897; a surveyor by profession, he had taken first prize honors at the Royal Agricultural College in 1877 and passed the professional examination of the Institution of Surveyors in 1885. The couple had two daughters: Lettice Cautley Baker (later Ramsey), born in Guildford, Surrey, England in 1898; and Frances Cautley Baker (later Trench; later Farrell), born in Thakeham, Sussex, England in 1902. The family moved to Rosses Point, County Sligo, where Cecil Baker leased oyster farming rights in the Sligo estuary. He died suddenly in 1903, and his widow and young family moved to Ballysadare, where Frances had a farm, worked as a photographer and continued painting.
Working both in oil and watercolor, producing portraits and landscapes, Baker exhibited regularly with George William Russell (AE). In Dublin, Baker was acquainted with Irish activists and artists including Constance Gore-Booth and her second husband Casimir Dunin Markievicz. She exhibited paintings in a joint show at the Leinster Lecture Hall in 1911 with Markievicz, Russell, and Paul and Grace Henry. She also showed work in exhibitions at the Royal Hibernian Academy, Dublin, and the Royal Institute of Oil Painters.
Frances Baker married a second time in 1915 to Dublin physician Francis Kennedy Cahill. Her husband was active in amateur theatrical circles, and they were involved with the United Arts Club in Dublin.
In 1919, she opened a textile weaving workshop called the Crock of Gold in Dublin. The firm became well known as part of the craft revival of handwork and exhibited at the Irish Decorative Art Association exhibitions pre-Partition and the Arts and Crafts Society shows throughout the late 1920s and early 1930s. As with other successful handcrafting businesses at the time, the firm’s traditional handmade textiles sold to modern fashion designers, including French designer Coco Chanel. Baker's daughter Frances and her husband, the writer Michael Farrell, later managed the highly successful business.
Baker's second husband Dr Francis Kennedy Cahill died suddenly in 1930 in Dublin, while Baker was in England attending the funeral of her son-in-law, the Cambridge mathematician Frank P. Ramsey. Baker lived in France for a time but settled in Cambridge by the late 1930s. She died in Cambridge in November 1944.
Paintings.
After her second marriage, Baker was known as Mrs Kennedy Cahill and Frances Cahill; she signed her work with the initials “FB” and “FC.”

Glen Tomasetti

Glenys Ann Tomasetti (1929–2003), known as Glen Tomasetti, was an Australian singer-songwriter, author and political activist. During the 1960s she appeared weekly on commercial television, performing satirical political songs. She became a household name in 1967 after refusing to pay a portion of her taxes in protest against Australia's involvement in the war in Vietnam. Although best known for her folk music and political activism, she was also an esteemed novelist and poet.
Biography.
Early life.
Glen Tomasetti was born in Melbourne on 21 May 1929.
Musical career.
Tomasetti began performing as a singer-songwriter and guitarist in the late 1950s. In the early 1960s she organised folk music concerts at the Emerald Hill Theatre in South Melbourne, a centre of the 1960s Melbourne folk scene. Later in the 1960s she appeared weekly on Channel Seven TV, performing a topical political song after the general news broadcast.
Anti-war activism and 1967 court case.
Australia entered the war in Vietnam in 1962 in support of the USA, and in 1965 began sending conscripted servicemen to Vietnam. Tomasetti became involved in the Save Our Sons organisation, a group of women opposed to military conscription, and in December 1965 she helped to organise the "Songs of Peace and Love" protest concert at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl in Melbourne, described as "the first major response of the folk scene" to Australia's military involvement in Vietnam.
In 1967 Tomasetti was prosecuted after refusing to pay one sixth of her taxes on the grounds that one sixth of the federal budget was funding Australia's military presence in Vietnam. In court she argued that Australia's participation in the Vietnam War violated its international legal obligations as a member of the United Nations. Public figures such as Joan Baez had made similar protests in the USA, but Tomasetti's prosecution was "believed to be the first case of its kind in Australia", according to a contemporary news report. Tomasetti was eventually ordered to pay the unpaid taxes.
Feminist activism.
Many of Tomasetti's songs dealt with feminism and the situation of Australian women. Perhaps the best known is "Don't be too polite, girls", a call for equal pay and a feminist call to arms. Sung to the tune of a classic 19th century Australian shearing ballad ("All among the wool, boys"), it was inspired by the first ruling on equal pay in Australia, a 1969 Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration ruling that granted equal pay to only 18% of Australian women. The song was still being sung by the Melbourne Trade Union Choir at the time of Tomasetti's death in 2003.
Writing.
In 1967 Tomaestti organised the first poetry readings at La Mama Theatre in Carlton, Melbourne, a program that continues today.
She published her first novel, "Thoroughly Decent People", in 1976. It was the first book published by the notable independent Australian publishing house McPhee Gribble. The poet and literary scholar Chris Wallace-Crabbe described it as "one of the break-through novels in portraying ordinary suburban life without a supercilious sneer". She later published poems and another novel, "Man of Letters".
Marriage and children.
Glen Tomasetti had three children.

Yamba, South Australia

Yamba is a locality in the eastern Riverland of South Australia. It is the last place in South Australia on the Sturt Highway before crossing into Victoria. It is the site of a permanent fruit fly inspection checkpoint, and a large advertisement in the shape of an arc of a vehicle tyre spanning the road.
Yamba was previously served by a station on the Barmera railway line.
Fruit fly checkpoint.
On the westward journey, Yamba is the first place in South Australia on the Sturt Highway, and is usually a mandatory stop at the fruit fly biosecurity checkpoint as fruit is not permitted to be carried into South Australia to preserve the state's fruit-fly-free status. The checkpoint has operated since 1957, when it was quickly established in response to a fruit fly outbreak at Mildura. The primary threat on this route is Queensland fruit fly.
