Plot.
Isabel Andersen, co-founder of an orphanage in India, must travel to New York to meet a potential benefactor, millionaire CEO Theresa Young. Isabel is unwilling to travel due to her responsibilities at the orphanage and because she does not want to leave Jai (Vir Pachisia), a boy whom she found on the street when he was at age 1. He is the closest child in the orphanage to Isabel, and doesn’t want Isabel to leave, but Theresa insists on an in-person meeting. Reluctantly, Isabel agrees and goes to the meeting, which takes place the day before the wedding of Theresa’s daughter Grace. Theresa invites Isabel to the wedding as a courtesy and Isabel feels obliged to attend.
At the wedding, Isabel is surprised to see Theresa's husband is her teenage sweetheart Oscar Carlson, now a renowned visual artist. During Grace’s wedding toast, she discovers that Grace is not Theresa’s biological daughter, but is Oscar’s. Isabel soon realizes that Grace is in fact her own daughter by Oscar, whom they had given up for adoption as teenagers. Isabel returns to the house the day after the wedding to confront Oscar and learns that after giving the baby up for adoption, he changed his mind within the 30-day grace period and reclaimed the infant Grace without informing her. Isabel then forces Oscar and Theresa to also inform Grace, who had always been told her biological mother had died.
Theresa encourages Isabel to get to know Grace and reconnect with Oscar, and eventually decides to dramatically increase her donation to the orphanage, thereby forcing Isabel to extend her stay in New York. Eventually, Theresa makes her donation, as well as a newly established fund in Isabel and Grace’s name, contingent on Isabel moving to New York permanently.
Mistrustful of Theresa’s real motives, Isabel angrily confronts her and learns that Theresa is dying. Theresa admits she has known about Isabel’s link to Oscar and Grace all along and arranged the whole charade to install Isabel as a new mother figure to both Grace and Theresa's own eight-year-old twin boys. Oscar discovers his wife’s illness around the same time and eventually tells Grace, who is already struggling with doubts about her recent marriage and the news that Isabel is her biological mother.
Theresa dies soon after and the family scatter her ashes. Isabel then returns to India for a visit to the orphanage and Jai.
The movie ends with Jai and his friends playing football in the orphanage.
Production.
In February 2018, Julianne Moore was set to star in an American remake of the Danish film by Susanne Bier, and will see the leading roles changed from male to female. Diane Kruger was also cast. However, in April 2018, Michelle Williams replaced Kruger. In May 2018, Billy Crudup and Abby Quinn joined the cast.
Principal production began in May 2018.
Release.
The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 24, 2019. Shortly after, Sony Pictures Classics acquired U.S. distribution rights to the film, and set it for an August 9, 2019, release.
Reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 45% based on 155 reviews, and an average rating of 5.76/10. The site's critical consensus reads: ""After the Wedding" benefits from solid casting and strong source material, yet proves stubbornly resistant to spark to emotional life." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100, based on reviews from 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Variety's Peter Debruge wrote: "This sensitive remake of Susanne Bier's overcooked Danish Oscar nominee has shrewdly been flipped from a male-driven meller to an emotional showcase for Michelle Williams and Julianne Moore." Debruge praises the film for its subtlety, as it "strips away anything excessive, allowing subtext to surface in the quiet spaces between dialogue."
David Rooney of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: "Bart Freundlich's American remake of the Bier film flips the gender of the main characters, yielding predictably strong performances from Julianne Moore and Michelle Williams but otherwise removing the teeth from a melodrama that grows increasingly preposterous as it crawls toward its weepy conclusion."
Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2 out of 4, and wrote: "It's a morose and slow-paced and off-putting drama, in which even the joyous moments seem brittle and draped in melancholy."
David Fear of "Rolling Stone" gave the film a mixed review but praised Williams: "This is Williams’ spotlight, and it's worth slogging through some of the soapier-to-sludgier aspects to watch her ply her craft."

Antonia Bruha

Antonia "Toni" Bruha (born Antonia Spath; 1 March 1915 – 27 December 2006) was an Austrian resistance activist. After the war she became a translator and author.
Provenance and early years.
Antonia Spath was born in Vienna shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. During the first six years of her life she and her elder sister grew up with their grandparents in Bohemia because their parents could not afford to feed them. Back in Vienna, once the financial situation improved for the girls' parents, she found her mother very strict. She grew up bilingual in German and Czech, later also adding Russian to her repertoire of languages. Her father, the son of an Erdberg coachman, who himself worked as a master-brewer at the Ottakringer Brewery, saw to it that she attended a , and she was keen to pursue Slavic studies at a higher level, but this time her mother's uncompromisingly conservative convictions prevailed.
In the end she embarked on an apprenticeship with Joseph Schindler, as a hairdresser and beauty therapist. She had made contact with Schindler through a Quaker Youth Group. Alongside her formal apprenticeship, the Quaker group provided English lessons. In return, she taught her colleagues, who had plans to set up a Quaker group in Prague, Czech. She was fascinated by the pacifist attitudes adopted by the Quakers: she found they fitted in well with the socialist precepts she had picked up from her father who had been politically active at the time of the Dual Monarchy. According to her own later recollections, Antonia Spath learned almost nothing about hairdressing, but she did manage to make three visits to Prague during her apprenticeship.
Gymnastics, politics and marriage.
She became a member of a . The times were becoming increasingly politicised, and membership of the club was restricted to Social Democrats. In 1933 Antonia Spath began writing, under the pseudonym Tanja Spatová, for the Czech language labour movement press, contributing to "Vídeňské dělnické listy" ("Vienna Workers' Pages") and ""Mladý dělnik" ("Young Worker"). It was at the that she met Josef Bruha, whom she later married. Bruha was a gifted gymnast and employed by Siemens as a factory foreman. He was also a former Republican Protection League ("... Schutzbund") member. In February 1934 he participated in the disturbances around the vast and, as a result, lost his job. When the two of them married in 1935 their financial situation was dire, since Bruha had still been unable to find employment, and his wife's work as a hairdresser was poorly paid. Nevertheless, supported by her husband Antonia Bruha was able to fulfill "her life's dream" in 1936 when she enrolled at the university to study languages. It was partly in order to supplement the household income that she continued to provide poems and short stories, now under the pseudonym Tana Bruhova, to the Czech-language (and later also German-language) socialist press. However, an early casualty of the German annexation of Austria in March 1938 was the university's Faculty of Slavonic Studies which was closed down by the Nazis. Antonia Bruha never completed her degree.
Inspired, no doubt, by developments in Germany, during 1933, Austria was also becoming increasingly fascist and dictatorial even before the German invasion. Josef and Antonia Bruha actively opposed Chancellor Schuschnigg's government. Together they would bicycle to the frontier with Czechoslovakia, in a wooded area near Preßburg, in order to collect bundles of Socialist and Communist publications, banned in Austria, that had been left for them by comrades. They then distributed the contraband publications in Vienna.
Anschluss and opposition.
After the annexation Austria quickly became incorporated into an enlarged Nazi German state. Opposition activism became both more dangerous and, for the politically committed, more urgent. However, for the Bruhas the situation was complicated by Josef's work situation. Fourteen days after the Nazis arrived he was re-employed by Siemens not in his previous post as a foreman, but as a divisional head, in charge of a department containing 300-400 women, two mechanics and his own typist (according to his wife). In financial terms the Nazi take-over triggered a hitherto unknown level of prosperity for the couple. The Bruhas nevertheless joined the resistance group around Alois Houdek. Initially the group was restricted to members of the Czech minority, but it subsequently expanded to include members of the German speaking community who had not previously been politically engaged. Toni Bruha wrote and distributed leaflets encouraging opposition to the government. Group members escorted Jews, escaping from the evolving hardships and dangers of state-mandated antisemitism, to the Swiss frontier. Members also engaged in acts of sabotage. Josef Bruha believed that it was impossible to be certain that no one would be hurt when a target was attacked, so refused to engage in sabotage actions, but the time came when he was sent to Berlin on a training course: Antonia took advantage of his absence to participate. An action in which she took part involved setting fire to – one source uses the term "blowing up" – army facilities. Already pregnant, she cycled with comrades, carrying a large quantity of chemicals that had been smuggled out of a factory, to a block of ten military storage depots containing uniforms, weapons and food rations, in Lobau. No lives were endangered, she later maintained with evident satisfaction.
Welcoming members from beyond the confines of the Czech minority made the group more vulnerable to infiltration, and towards the end of 1940 the group of worker-gymnast activists was penetrated by a Gestapo spy. Most would pay for their actions with their lives. The arrests began during the first part of 1941. By 1943 the authorities had detained one hundred group members of whom sixty-nine had not survived. Among those who perished, shot or beheaded, were Alois Houdek himself and Franz Narkowitz, who had been one of those involved, with Bruha, in the Lobau "event".
Antonia Bruha had always wanted to have a child, but the timing of her pregnancy and of her daughter's birth, on 5 July 1941, was unplanned. It was shortly after Sonja's birth that Bruha became aware that their group contained a Gestapo informer. Her own arrest, together with that of her husband and her infant child, occurred around 15 October 1941. Josef Bruha was "of interest" to the authorities because of his former involvement with the Republican Protection League. However, they seem to have decided quite early on (and probably wrongly) that he was not involved in recent resistance activism, and after four days he was released for "lack of evidence". If fellow detainees had known of his involvement, they had stayed silent over it. Antonia Bruha was detained, however.
Under arrest.
For two days following her arrest Bruha was held at the Gestapo headquarters in Vienna's Hotel Metropol in the . Those first two days consisted of an unbroken series of interrogation sessions during which she was beaten "... with sticks. With all means possible". Soon after the interrogation began the infant Sonja was violently removed from her mother and taken away by a female member of the interrogation team. When Bruha moved to get her daughter back she was blocked, pushed and then beaten by two guards using their revolvers to hit her. For around a year the mother, whose parting memory was of Sonja's anguished yelling as she saw her mother beaten back by interrogators, was unaware of the child's fate. At least once she was told that her child was dead. Only after she had been transferred to Ravensbrück concentration camp, at least a year later, a fellow inmate would pass her a copy of a photograph sent by her husband from which she would be able to see that Sonja was alive. Then, on 8 October, she was placed in solitary confinement for around eight months in a building in which the Gestapo were using the fourth floor. Her period of regular interrogations lasted around three months, during which time she was not permitted to change her clothes or wash herself. The sessions involved serious beatings which often left her unconscious. Sessions took place every two or three days. At the end of that she was required to sign both her own death warrant and those for twenty men and four women who had been in the resistance group with her.
It later transpired that after being taken from her mother Sonja had been taken to the . There the chief nurse, without any authorisation, had sent the child to a foster family. This meant that Josef Bruha would be able to maintain contact with her. For the Gestapo Sonja was valued chiefly as a means to apply pressure to her mother, forcing her to testify against resistance comrades. Sources insist that Bruha resisted the pressure, however, and never betrayed anyone, despite being uncertain of her daughter's fate throughout the interrogations period.
Ravensbrück.
In September/October 1942 Antonia briefly faced a tribunal before being returned to the jail in Vienna. In October 1942 she was transferred to the Ravensbrück concentration camp in the damp flat countryside to the north of Berlin. She was one of thirteen women from the Czech and Slovak resistance sent together from the Vienna area. One of them was her friend Irma Trksak, sister to Franz Narkowitz who had been a member of the Lobau team (and paid with his life for his involvement). The journey lasted around for weeks. She was accompanied by a "Rückkehr Unerwünscht" ("Do not send back") instruction, which amounted to a death sentence. Through the mediation of Hermi Jursa they remained together on arriving, accommodated in the "Political Block" in which was "Block senior" ("Blockälteste"). Jochmann's leadership went some way to mitigate the horrors of concentration camp life and, above all, to encourage camp inmates to coordinate opposition to the SS personnel running the camp on behalf of the Nazi authorities. Inmates were also encouraged to display practical solidarity with political detainees, the old and the weak.
At the start Toni Bruha was set to work pushing "Lore", heavy little trucks on rails, after which she was sent to join the "tailoring" workshop. The camp medical centre was her third workplace. Her experiences here were the most horrendous she faced in the concentration camp. Nevertheless, thanks to her language skills her secondment here was probably what saved her life. A camp doctor, faced with the challenge of investigating 200 newly arrived prisoners from Poland, asked for a . Antonia Bruha filled the vacancy. When a camp commandant came to collect her for "liquidation", the doctor exploded, "I can shoot her for myself. [Right now] I still need her!" ("Erschiessen kann ich sie selber. Ich brauche sie noch!"). Bruha lived through numerous brutal crimes by the SS "gynaecologists", and : agonising pseudo-medical experiments on the legs of Polish women, forced sterilisations, murders of newborns and recruitments for forced sex work. And yet, she was able to risk her life by smuggling drugs to internees in the political block and by carefully switching index cards in the medical centre. As a message-courier for the medical centre Bruha was also able to contribute in other important ways to the forced labour regime operating inside the camp, acting on behalf of the illegal international camp committee. She was, for example, involved in rescuing Toni Lehr, Gerti Schindel and Edith Wexberg. These three Jewish communists activists arrived at Ravensbrück from Auschwitz: they faced death. Death was also a major risk for any inmate caught helping them. Nevertheless, for weeks, while the SS personnel tried to find them among the inmates, they were successfully hidden in ever changing locations, while a Yugoslav inmate who was also a doctor operated on the arms of two of them to remove numbers from Auschwitz. (The third of them was too ill, with Typhus, to face the hazards of an operation at this point.) In the end all three were kept away from the camp authorities until, shortly before the war ended, they were smuggled out in a Swedish Red-Cross transport.
As the Soviet army drew relentlessly closer from the east, a succession of so-called "evacuation marches" from the concentration camp at Ravensbrück set off on 28 April 1945, quickly becoming death marches. Those who could go no further were shot by the SS. Those too ill to march were simply left behind. Bertl Lauscher, Irma Trksak and Toni Bruha agreed that their best chance of survival would be to join one of the last columns to leave the camp, and then take the first opportunity to escape. By this point even the guards were simply running off, and the three succeeded in escaping through Poland and Czechoslovakia back to Vienna. The journey was not without adventure: it took them nearly four weeks to get home. Much of the city had been destroyed by bombs. The Bruhas' house was still standing, but it had no roof. Both with regard to family life and in respect of earning a living, re-establishing a "normal" existence presented huge challenges for the concentration camp survivors.
After Ravensbrück.
By the time she arrived home Toni Bruha weighed just 20 Kg (44 pounds). The baby snatched from her back in 1941 was a toddler a few weeks short of her fourth birthday. The reunion was a fiasco as the child complained to her carer, "Auntie, this ugly old woman says she is my mother. My mother in the photo is a beautiful blonde lady! Send this one back, that's not my Mum". It would be some time before something approaching a normal mother:daughter relationship could be established. During her first year at home Toni Bruha was permanently ill as a result of her treatment and the conditions at the concentration camp. Nevertheless, once Sonja had started school, in 1946 she took a job with the "Russian Hours" section at "Radio Vienna" service of the , translating German texts into Russian and Czech. She remained with the radio station for approximately ten years. (The Soviet occupation of eastern Austria ended early in 1955, after which audiences for Russian language radio programmes were no longer present in significant numbers.) She also wrote contemporary history contributions for the book "Österreich April 1945" (produced by und ) as well as providing contributions to the press, notably for ), the newly established Czech language newspaper in Vienna.
Against amnesia.
Very soon after the collapse of Nazi Germany, Bruha was demonstrating a determination to ensure that the horrors of those times should not be forgotten. In 1947, as victim groups began to splinter along political lines, women who had survived the cells and concentration camps came together to form the "Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community" ("Oesterreichische Lagergemeinschaft Ravensbrück"). Toni Bruha was one of the founders. Fifty years later, along with fellow survivors and supporters, she was able to look back on some of the achievements to which she had contributed: an Austrian Memorial space set up at , a Ravensbrück exhibition during the 1960s which was staged successively in Vienna, Innsbruck, Klagenfurt, Salzburg and other population centres, an accompanying Exhibition Booklet on Ravensbrück, designed principally for young people, which reached 40,000 copies, the organisation in Austria of international Ravensbrück meetings and much more. Antonia Bruha was also engaged over many years as the meticulous treasurer of the "Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community". Especially remarkable was her volunteer work after 1968 to create and built up the Ravensbrück Archive section in the Documents Centre of the Austrian Resistance. A collection of more than 800 files – documents, written memory pieces, trial documents covering the Ravensbrück and Uckermark concentration camps – provided and will continue to provide scholars and academics an important research resource.
Long before 1978, after which visits by contemporary witnesses to the Nazi horrors were included on school curricula and organised by the Ministry for Education, Antonia Bruha was making her own arrangements to speak to groups of young people about her resistance and concentration camp experiences. She believed these presentations were hugely important. Her lively and direct narrative style penetrated the hearts of many young listeners and inspired the political and personal commitment in new generations, necessary to avoid any tragic repeat of those Nazi years. She also backed up her message with written contributions to magazines and newspapers. Finally, in 1984, her autobiography, "Ich war keine Heldin" ("I was no heroine"), appeared. Its focus was on the period between her arrest and the reunion with her daughter, four years later.
By the time she addressed the annual "Austrian Ravensbrück Camp Community" meeting as a ninety year old Antonia Bruha was suffering badly with Diabetes and undergoing regular hospital stays, though friends insist that her willin assertiveness of an energetic commitment to democracy and freedom remained impressive. She died on 27 December 2006, some weeks short of what would have been her ninety-second birthday. Her body is buried in Vienna's misleadingly named Central Cemetery.

 is a micro-asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter. Its official first observation was made by the Catalina Sky Survey at Mount Lemmon Observatory, Arizona, United States, on 4 February 2018. Two days later, the asteroid crossed the orbit of the Moon and made a very close approach to Earth.
Orbit and classification.
 belongs to the Apollo asteroids, which cross the orbit of Earth. Apollo's are the largest group of near-Earth objects with nearly 10 thousand known members. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.84–1.73 AU once every 18 months (531 days; semi-major axis of 1.28 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.35 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. With an aphelion of 1.73 AU, it is also a Mars-crosser, as it crosses the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU.
The body's observation arc begins with its first recorded observation by Pan-STARRS on 20 January 2018.
Close approaches.
The object has a low minimum orbital intersection distance with Earth of , which corresponds to 0.078 lunar distances (LD). On 8 February 2034, it will approach Earth to a distance of or 8.2 LD.
2018 flyby.
On 6 February 2018, it passed at a nominal distance of from Earth (0.49 LD). One hour earlier, it passed the Moon at .
Physical characteristics.
The body's physical parameter remain largely unknown. Based on a generic magnitude-to-diameter conversion, and for an absolute magnitude of 26.541, the asteroid measures 15 and 40 meters in diameter, assuming a carbonaceous and stony albedo of 0.057 and 0.20, respectively. No rotational lightcurve has been obtained from photometric observations, and no rotation period, shape or pole has been determined.
Naming.
As of 2018, this minor planet has not been numbered or named.

Samira Winter

Samira Winter (born May 9, 1991) is a Brazilian singer and songwriter, best known as the vocalist of the bi-lingual indie rock band Winter.
Career.
Winter was born in Curitiba, Brazil, to a Brazilian mother and an American father. She moved to Los Angeles, California, in order to get into college. Her band, Winter, named after her last name, was conceived in Boston in 2012, and they soon released their first EP, "Daydreaming", on the next year, through Lolipop Records. The 4-track EP consists of dreamy-pop, indie rock compositions written by Winter. The band's next release was 2014's "Tudo Azul", also a 4-track EP; mostly of the lyrics on this release are sang on Portuguese.
Winter's debut album, "Supreme Blue Dream", was released on March 10, 2015. Even though the album had moderated commercial success, it was critically acclaimed and spawned three singles: "Some Kind of Surprise", "Crazy" and "Pretender", all of whom had music videos released. The band embarked on a 2-year international tour to support the album, touring mostly through the USA, Brazil and Argentina.
Between 2016 and 2018, while still touring to support Supreme Blue Dream, Winter released several singles with accompanying music videos, including "All the Things You Do", "Jaded" and "Dreaming". The latter has reached over 200,000 plays on Spotify, becoming the band's most successful song so far. Meanwhile, the Winter band was joined by American duo Summer Twins, formed by sisters Chelsea and Justine Brown.
Winter's second studio album, "Ethereality", was announced in February 2018, and is set to be released on April 6, 2018. "Ethereality" also marks the debut release by Everything Blue Records, Winter's official record label.
Samira's Infinite Summer.
While working with the Winter band, Samira also gave birth to a solo project entitled "Samira's Infinite Summer" in mid-2015. All of the demos for the project were recorded on Samira's bedroom and posted on Samira's Infinite Summer's Bandcamp page. A studio-recorded single, "Café", was released on December 2016 and promoted mainly through the Brazilian press, since its lyrics were written in Portuguese. However, the project's Facebook and Bandcamp pages were deactivated in 2017.
Artistry.
Samira is regarded for having a glittery, holographic aesthetic, which has accompanied her since her very first release as Winter. Her lyrics are known for mixing both English and Portuguese languages, which helped her to develop a following in Brazil and in the United States simultaneously. She also has a cult following in Japan.

OnePath Network

OnePath Network is an Australian Islamic-themed original content video production studio and media outlet based in Sydney, Australia. It was established in 2014 as a not-for-profit organization and da‘wah media network. It publishes videos, articles, news, and interviews, and produced the short film Last Chance.
History.
OnePath network was founded in March 2014 in Sydney as a non-profit by Malaz Majanni as a da‘wah initiative; the goal was to create "values based" video content to counter negative views of Islam and Muslims and to generate news, documentaries, and commentary from a Muslim perspective. The network was started with $1M in donations from the Muslim community, and sought to grow by selling advertising aimed at young Muslims. It aimed to distribute its content through its website and apps, YouTube, Facebook, and occasionally in other outlets like movie theaters. The project was endorsed by Ibrahim Abu Mohamed, the Grand Mufti of Australia, and in April 2015 Irfan Yusuf endorsed the network in an editorial published in the Sydney Morning Herald.
Guests have included Brian McDonald, the head of the AFP counterterrorism team, and in 2016 they interviewed Oliver Bridgeman, who alleged that he had been trapped in Syria after the Australian Government cancelled his passport.
In October 2016 the OnePath Network produced Last Chance, a 45-minute film about a young Muslim man tempted into a life of selling drugs and violence, which was shown in movie theaters in Australia. By February 2018 the network had made and released around 400 videos.
Awards.
At the 2016 Australian Muslim Achievement Awards, OnePath Network won Media Organisation of the Year, and one of its hosts was a finalist for Role Model of the Year. The following year, in 2017, the network won the award in the "media" category of Dubai's Islamic Economy Awards.

He studied at Charles University in Prague, and worked at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences for a while in 1956. At Charles University, he was gradually promoted to associate professor. However. Between 1954–1964, he was doing university research in Khartoum in Sudan. Between 1964–1965 he returned Prague but the Institute of Advanced Studies in Canberra, Australia attracted him between 1965 and 1968.
After the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he wasn't quite embraced with open arms. So in 1971, he left for Ottawa, Canada where he founded and led a department of modern mathematics at Carleton University that has significantly influenced the world of algebra, probability, and statistics.
Because his father was ill in the early 1980s, Dlab – as an alien – was allowed to visit Czechoslovakia and he restored his relationship with Charles University. In the late 1980s, he taught some courses again there, and he regained full professorship in 1992.
Academic ancestry and collaborators.
Dlab was a postdoctoral student of renowned Czech mathematician Eduard Čech.
While in Canada, Dlab worked as the editor-of-chief of mathematical journals and chairman of assorted organizations and institutions. In 1977, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.
Claus Michael Ringel was the co-author of some of the most famous academic works by Dlab, such as the 1976 book "Indecomposable representations of graphs and algebras". Dlab helped to educate numerous students of mathematics who became successful by themselves.
Teaching of mathematics.
In recent years, Dlab was very active in efforts to improve the mathematics education. In the Czech Republic, he's been often quoted as an authority that is skeptical towards modern methods to teach, e.g. the method of Milan Hejný. He emphasizes the key role played by the quality of teachers.

Rochelle Blumenfeld

Rochelle Blumenfeld is an American artist from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Her paintings have been exhibited in many public and private collections, including the Carnegie Museum of Art. Her work has been included in the Bicentennial Exhibit of “American Painters in Paris” in Paris, France, Copley Society of Art, Boston, Dunfermline Fife, Scotland, and the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, Greensburg, Pennsylvania.
Biography.
Rochelle Blumenfeld was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1936. Her grandparents were immigrants from the Soviet Union. Her father, Lawrence Reznik, was a sign painter, also making window displays. Blumenfeld's grandfather, Harry Fairman, was an artist and a decorator for the wealthy neighborhoods in the East End of Pittsburgh. He encouraged her to start painting and inspired her to pursue art.
Blumenfeld started taking art classes at the Carnegie Museum starting in 5th grade. In High School, she took an advanced art class in painting at the Carnegie Tech, which later became known as Carnegie Mellon University. After graduation, she applied and was accepted as a Painting and Design student at Carnegie Mellon University. She completed one year and left the university to get married. Blumenfeld missed painting, and she enrolled in a class at the Young Men and Women's Hebrew Association, which was taught by Samuel Rosenberg (artist), who also taught Andy Warhol. Samuel Rosenberg was a big influence on her future as a painter.
Rochelle Blumenfeld married Irving Blumenfeld in 1955. He was a co-founder of Gateway Paint Company in the Strip district of Pittsburgh. Together they had 3 children and 5 grandchildren.
Life as an artist.
Samuel Rosenberg (artist) introduced Blumenfeld to the world of abstract art. She was inspired by life around her to reflect and make statements in her paintings. Blumenfeld used bold colors, light, and movement in her art to express herself. She was inspired by the natural shapes of the world around her, and paintings represent a period of changes. The artist stated "Life continually alters its course on an unknown journey, and coping is not always easy".
In 1958, Rochelle Blumenfeld started exhibiting professionally, when she was accepted into the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh. This started a long career of exhibiting her work through the United States and Europe.
In the 1970s Rochelle Blumenfeld had a one-person show at the Carnegie Museum of Art. In 1976 her paintings were included in the Bicentennial Exhibition, “Americans in Paris”, Paris, France. Blumenfeld showed her work with the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh in Dunfermline Scotland to honor Andrew Carnegie at his birthplace.
In the 1990s, Blumenfeld started a series of paintings representing Jewish holidays and Shabbat. Some of her Judaica paintings were included in the Hallmark Cards "Tree of Life" series in 1999.
In 2000, Blumenfeld was inspired by seeing Revelations (Alvin Ailey), Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. She wanted to keep and share her memories of the dance, which started a series of paintings she named "Celebration of Spirit". In 2004, in conjunction with the Three Rivers Arts Festival, she had a one-person show of her ballet paintings at the One Oxford Centre in Pittsburgh.
In 2017 Blumenfeld exhibited "Hill District Paintings" which was very different from her other exhibits, as it tells a story of her family and the streets of the city where she grew up.
In 2011 Blumenfeld had a conversation with her grandchildren that inspired the artist to use her paintings to recreate memories of diverse neighborhood with people of different ethnic backgrounds, all struggling to make a living during the Great Depression and World War II. Her grandson wanted to know where the cash register came from that he played with. Blumenfeld said that the cash register came from her grandfather's store on Logan Street, Pittsburgh. It came to her house after the store closed. Cash register became her first painting in this series. 
Painting the cash register triggered her other memories and she completed a total of 14 Hill District Paintings. The last painting in the series is her memory of a patriotic parade on Fifth Avenue during World War II, honoring the soldiers.
Blumenfeld's "Hill District Paintings" were included in the documentary by Kenneth Love "Jewish Memories of the Hill District". Her grandfather Sam Reznik ran a store on Logan Street, where clothes hung from the ceiling.
In 2020 Blumenfeld was included in the Master Visual Artists VII: Preserving the Legacy exhibition. It was hosted at the Heinz History Center of Pittsburgh in partnership with the Master Visual Artists Project – a local group dedicated to recognizing the lifelong achievements of influential artists in Southwestern Pennsylvania. The featured artists stories were documented to be preserved for future generations.
Publications.
Blumenfeld's work has been published by Hallmark Cards, Kennedy Publishing, Allied Publications, and Hachai Publishing.
Awards.
As a member of the Associated Artists of Pittsburgh, Rochelle Blumenfeld received many awards including a Carnegie Museum of Art purchase award for their permanent collection in 1960.,
In 1966, Blumenfeld won first prize in a nationwide art contest, sponsored by Enjay Chemical Company.

Springfield Traction Company

Springfield Traction Company was a company that operated surface Horse, Steam, and Electric Trams and Streetcars across the Springfield Metro from around 1869 to August 1937.
Lines run.
The only known name of a line that the Springfield Traction Company ran is the Woodland Heights Line, However, the whole city was covered by the system by 1929. Two other names have been suspected to have been named the "Downtown Line" and the "Commercial Street Line".
History.
The original horse and mule powered street railway in Springfield, Missouri began operation around 1869. It operated on a line connecting the Square to the Commercial Street district along Boonville, then down Benton to what was then the passenger train depot.
By 1929 the electric streetcar system covered what was then the entire city limits, giving citizens universal access to public transportation. Streetcar lines radiated in four directions from Park Central Square, creating a beehive of activity in the heart of the city.
In 1936, the Springfield Traction Company announced that the next year the electric streetcars would be replaced by gasoline-powered buses. To them, it seemed “the modern thing to do.” A final streetcar parade was held on August 2, 1937, with people cramming into the cars for one last ride.

Matsui Nursery

Matsui Nursery is a California-based producer of potted orchids.
History.
Toshikiyo Andy Matsui was born in Japan in 1935. He was raised on a small farm where his family grew starch products. Matsui decided to join a farm program in the U.S. and moved to Mountain View, California in 1961, where he apprenticed in growing chrysanthemums (the national flower of Japan). He moved permanently with his wife and first daughter to California soon thereafter. In 1969 he bought 50 acres of land near Salinas, California building greenhouses for flowers. He grew chrysanthemums, then roses. In 1998 at age 63, Matsui switched to Orchids when stiff competition from other countries arose in traditional flowers. He is now the world’s largest potted orchid farmer.
In March 2015, Matsui's daughter Teresa Matsui became the president of Matsui Nursery.
Operations.
Matsui Nursery switched from cut flower to potted orchids on a large scale in 1998. Matsui Nursery started the country's first grocery retail program for potted orchids. It grows millions of orchids, with hundreds of varieties, yearly. It is one of the world's largest potted orchid growers.
It takes two to three years for the plants to grow from sprouts to store shelves. Matsui Nursery has about 10 million potted orchids continuously in production in 75 acres of greenhouse. The orchids are shipped across the U.S. and globally.
Matsui Foundation.
In 2004 Matsui formed an educational foundation to make grants to students among the company's workforce and their families.
In 2013, the Foundation donated one million dollars to the CSin3 Program, which was developed to allow farm-worker children to attend college and obtain a degree in computer science. The program was developed by CSUMB and Hartnell College. The first class graduated in May 2016 with 22 students. In the process, Salinas hopes to turn into an agricultural technology hub.
On November 2, 2017, Teresa Matsui, on behalf of the Matsui Foundation, made a gift of 215 acres of land north east of Salinas to the local Junior College. This is agricultural land on which strawberries are grown under lease, which generates about $500,000 in annual income, and expires in 2019. The land is valued at $20 Million. This gift is the largest that the Hartnell College Foundation has ever received.

Songs of Paapieye

Songs of Paapieye is the fourth album by Ghanaian musician SK Kakraba, released in October 2015 by Awesome Tapes From Africa, becoming the first album of original material released by the typically reissue-centred label. The album showcases Kakraba's mastery of the gyil, a type of wooden, 14-slatted xylophone originating from Kakraba's native Ghana that features a distinctive, buzzy rattle with a slow decaying sound caused by spiders egg sac silk walls pulled across the gourds' holes, known in Kakraba's Lobi language as , which gives the album its name. It is smoother in sound than his previous album "Yonye" and is fast-paced, showcasing complex, intricate rhythms, drones and dialogue between lower, buzzing basslines and higher, syncopated notes. Many tracks feature several modes and move between different sections.
Kakraba recorded the album by himself without overdubs or accompaniment from other musicians, and used only the gyil. The tracks are song cycles, mostly drawing from Ghanaian traditional music, although there is original material on the album. Among the tracks, there are three funeral pieces. Upon release, where it was made available on a variety of formats, the album was one of only several albums of gyil music. It received critical acclaim, with critics highlighting the instrument's unusual sounds and timbres, the album's skillful pacing and Kakraba's virtuoso technique.
Background.
SK Kakraba is a master of the gyil xylophone, a Ghanaian instrument composed of calabash gourd resonators with 14 wooden slats strung across them. The buzzy rattle which sounds with each note, and with a decay pattern longer than the note, emits from the spiders' egg sacs' silk walls pulled across the gourds' holes, known in Kakraba's Lobi language as . While one hit is followed by another, the rattle from the first hit has yet to fully decay, creating a style of West African rhythms that are more complex than those of solitary notes. Kakraba performs, builds, teaches and sells the instrument. He first developed his skills on the instrument during his childhood days spent in Saru, Ghana, a farming village, and went on to become one of the most renowned and famous gyil players, especially after moving to Accra in 1997 around the age of 20, where Kakraba played his instrument around the zongos (Muslim ghettos) and Central Accra, which helped Kakraba get his "daily chop." He later began teaching the instrument at the University of Ghana's "International Centre for African Music and Dance."
After marrying his American-born wife, whom he met in Accra, Kakraba moved to Los Angeles in 2011, where he began releasing albums. Prior to recording "Songs of Paapieye", his latest album was "Yonye", released via Drag City in July 2015. He had known Awesome Tapes From Africa founder Brian Shimkovitz since 2002 when the latter was a student in Ghana, and over the years the two stayed in contact with each other. When "hanging out" in 2015, they decided "it would be cool to release a record" for Shimkovitz's label. "Songs of Paapieye" was recorded in San Francisco in a studio owned by Kakraba's close friend Brian Hogan. Unlike "Yonye", which features occasional added drums and bells, "Songs for Paapieye" is a solo project, recorded by Kakraba entirely by himself, playing live without any overdubs or accompanying guest musicians. This is unlike the traditional setting for gyil music, where two gyil players may play together with accompaniment from drums, bells and sometimes singing, and instead showcases Kakraba's "polyrhyhtmic force and creativity." He used the album to showcase music that he had taken with him to Los Angeles from the central Accra ghettos. Shimkovitz has been credited by one writer for producing the album.
Composition.
"Songs Of Paapieye" contains six solo, instrumental recordings, and features Kakraba's "favourite song cycles, funeral dirges, improvised interpretations on traditional songs and original compositions." Haydon Spenceley of "Drowned in Sound" called the album "a series of six song cycles." Besides being an album of solo recordings as opposed to a group recording, "Songs of Paapieye" also departs from "Yonye" in that it is smoother in sound. The tracks nonetheless sound like ensembles, via the "animated dialogue" between the deep buzzing, looping basslines and the syncopated higher, clearer notes. The album includes three funeral songs, each with a rapid, stop-start nature, although these tracks are not dissimilar, however, to "Sopka," which Kakraba claims is "happy hour music" played to "please your soul." Jon Pareles of "The New York Times" felt that the majority of the album, including funeral pieces, displays a propulsive but unpredictable style of dance music. The album has been described as "a big wash of complex rhythms," though the music does frequently exude melody.
The tracks approximate contrapuntal work in that they keep a rhythmic pace, boasting a shifting bassline, and then "work around the 'lead' line." Sections of phrases become emphasised with "parallel attacks", such as octaves but typically other intervals, and the pieces' pattern is highlighted with improvisatory waves. The pieces, which typically feature a couple of modes each, are complex and fast, and the paapieye rattles compound the rhythmic complexity and avoid creating phase relationships. "Aquarium Drunkard" noted that although harmonic elements of the album's pulsing drones are shared with the works of minimalist composers Terry Riley and Steve Reich, Kakraba's feel is "jazzier, earthier, and more folk focused."
The album opens with the short track "Lubile Prai," which was inspired by birdsong, and boasts stop-start shifts in tempo, working to build up anticipation for the succeeding tracks. The final third of the track features propelling cascades of melody. Kakraba says the nine-minute "Banyere Yo" is about a drunken blind man. The piece opens with a frantic yet intricate rallentando and diminuendo section that showcases the musician's virtuosity, with sounds akin to the paradiddle exercises (16th-note roll) of a drummer, before leading into a section based on a highly rhythmic riff, where extra elements are added and subtracted every time the riff cycles. The final section of the song features a shift in tempo. A two-note pattern resembling a siren emerges in the middle register at one point, surrounded by offbeat accent lines. "Dairfu" is similarly frenetic, yet features a permeating mournful tone and timbre, with offset bursts of cascading notes between bass-note patterns.
By contrast, "Darikpon Variations" features a riff which, according to Spenceley, bears harmonic and melodic similarity to the "straight-ahead grooves" of rock guitarist Jimmy Page. The groove is built upon and variations soon appear, with the pulsing lower end allowing room for the higher melodic echelons of the gyil to dominate. The track is also a funeral piece and features several sections with a loping bass-note in 6/8. "Sopka" is a shorter piece which places more attention on the gyil's lower tones, while "Guun" is "a funeral song to dance to, a final send-off for the recently departed," and displays the full potential of the gyil, with, as is characteristic of the album, tempo shifts and flowing melody. It features Kakraba's polyrhythms anchored by a singular loping bassline which alternates with "more exposed, almost scat-like improvisations." The track's "fluidity and flexibility of gesture" have been compared to jazz, despite the gyil far predating the genre, and as such, the track has been described as a bridge between the musical elements of gyil music and jazz.
Release.
Titled in honour of the gyil, "Songs of Paapieye" was first announced in August 2015, the same time "Guun" was made available for streaming to promote the album. The album was then subsequently released by Awesome Tapes From Africa on 2 October 2015 on CD, vinyl, cassette and digital formats, complete with liner notes containing biographical and track-by-track information. It is the label's first release of new material, as up until that point, it had focused on re-releasing obscure African albums only initially issued as cassettes in the continent. "Afropop Worldwide" noted that there have been very few releases of gyil music over time, so it was likely that "[t]wo things about Ghanaian gyil music are likely to grab a first-time listener: the deep, resonant buzz of the bass notes, and the polyrhythmic virtuosity—the right-hand/left-hand limb independence of master players."
Critical reception.
"Songs of Paapieye" received critical acclaim, especially for its unusual sound and Kakraba's virtuoso technique. Jakob Baekgaard of "All About Jazz" wrote that the music "embraces all aspects of life, from pieces meant to accompany a funeral to a type of ancient lounge music." While he noted that information about each track is detailed in the liner notes, the music can nonetheless be enjoyed "simply as an exotic journey into an unfamiliar world of sound. The many tones and textures of the gyil, both muffled and clear, are captivating and the lively percussive rhythms speak about the life-affirming quality of the music." Haydon Spenceley of "Drowned in Sound" wrote that "SK Kakraba won't, by any means, provide here an album for mass consumption, but, for the brave, or for the one who is much more a connoisseur, dig in. You might just come upon something special here." Minna Zhou of "Pitchfork" described the effect of the paapieye as "somewhere between drone and a more stripped-down, rhythmically intricate Konono Nº1."
Ian Sinclair of "Morning Star" said: "Fascinating and mesmeric if a little repetitive — to my Western ears at least — it’s unlike anything you’ve ever heard before." Jason Woodbury of "Aquarium Drunkard" called Kakraba's style "direct, sublime and utterly captivating," and concluded that "Kakraba’s polyrhythms are enveloping, and Awesome Tapes’ first foray into modern sounds is as essential as its archival releases." Stewart Smith of "The List" said that Kakraba's interpretations of Lobi songs impress throughout the album. He was impressed by the unlikely sound of the album's instrumentation: "Listeners could be forgiven for thinking there’s some Konono-style electronic processing involved, but the gyil is entirely acoustic." "Afropop Worldwide" wrote that ""Songs of Paapieye" captures the richness of the traditional gyil repertoire, the sonic depth of the instrument, and the polyrhythmic complexity of Kakraba’s playing." In their 2016 Bradt Travel Guides book "Ghana", authors Philip Briggs and Sean Connolly wrote that both "Yonye" and "Songs of Paapieye" are "genuinely exciting documents of a centuries-old tradition that continues to impress in the modern era."

You Got Me (Mýa song)

"You Got Me" is a song recorded by American singer Mýa. It was written by Sydnii Raymor and Mýa, while production was helmed by Lamar "Mars" Edwards. A sexy, sultry millennial slow jam similar to "Ready for Whatever" (2017), "You Got Me," is a blend of steady drums and sensual synths reminiscent of 90's R&amp;B featuring Harrison's signature breathy coos. Released February 14, 2018, "You Got Me" serves as the third single from "TKO (The Knock Out)" and commemorates the twentieth anniversary of her debut single "It's All About Me."
Background.
As tradition, on February 14, 2016, Mýa released her seventh studio album "Smoove Jones" (2016) to commemorate the release of her debut single "It's All About Me" and eighteenth anniversary in the entertainment industry. The release paid homage to R&amp;B/soul/hip-hop with old school elements from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s and was released exclusively through Apple Music. Critically, "Smoove Jones" received "generally favourable" reviews from music critics. In 2017, "Smoove Jones" received a nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, which were held on February 12, 2017. Two days later, as a gift to her fans and commemorating her nineteenth anniversary, Mýa released a music video for the fan favorite "Coolin'". Filmed in Sydney, Australia, director Matt Sharp captures the singer's unmistakable beauty while she lets her vocals do the rest on a sandy beach.
In late 2017, Mýa released the first single from the forthcoming studio album, Ready for Whatever on September 22, 2017. A music video for "Ready for Whatever" was produced and directed by Mýa co-starring R&amp;B singer Kevin McCall as her love interest. Less than two months, its follow up single and sequel, Ready, Part II was released on November 24, 2017. The song paid homage to R.Kelly's It Seems Like You're Ready.
Composition.
"You Got Me" is a song written by Mýa and Sydnii Raymor while production was handled by Lamar "MyGuyMars" Edwards. Described as a sexy, sultry slow jam, "You Got Me" features a combination of steady drums, sensual synths reminiscent of 90's R&amp;B and finger snapping with Harrison's signature breathy coos. Lyrically, the song embraces that sentiment painting a vivid image of love making with straightforward lyrics and a serene voice.
Music video.
Shot in Glendale, California, the simple, sexy, and energetic visual features Mýa seducing her love interest dressed in athletic attire at a dance studio equipped with mirrors that is reminiscent of the '80s fitness craze. Subsequently, Mýa turns up the heat when she's joined by her two female dancers.

Coal-fired pizza

Coal-fired pizza is a pizza style in the United States. New York-style pizza and New Haven-style pizza are often cooked in coal-fired pizza ovens. A coal-fired oven can reach and cook a pie in two to three or five minutes.
Pizzerias outside of the Northeastern United States that feature coal-fired ovens are uncommon enough to be noted in travel guides: for instance, Black Sheep Pizza with the first coal-fired oven in Minneapolis, or URBN in San Diego. As of 2007, coal-fired ovens were quite uncommon in the Western United States with only five west of the Mississippi: four in an Arizona chain and one more in Las Vegas.
Coal Fire Oven has now opened up in Windsor, Ontario, Canada as the only oven in Eastern Canada. It is renowned for their coal fire pizza and wings - The Chelsea Coal Fire Pizza. They are now doing coal fire frozen pizzas too.
The growing popularity of coal-fired pizza in the 2010s was identified as a major market for anthracite coal suppliers, most of whom are in Pennsylvania's Coal Region, who generally see a declining market due to alternate industrial and home heating fuel sources.
Health concerns.
Concerns have been raised about particulates, sulfur dioxide and CO2 emissions from coal-fired pizza ovens.

Midshipman Prayer

The "Prayer of a Midshipman" was written by William Nathaniel Thomas in 1938. Thomas (1892-1979) was the Chief of Chaplains of the United States Navy. He wrote the "Prayer of a Midshipman" at the request of the midshipmen while Command Chaplain at the United States Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland. It is said to encompass much of his theology and his ideal of a Naval Officer." He never sought credit for the prayer. There is an original version and an ungendered interfaith version. The prayer has been used at Divine Services at the US Naval Academy Chapel ever since 1938. A bronze plaque of the prayer resides in the chapel.
During Plebe summer 2013 the US Naval Academy Chaplain Center conducted a Midshipman Prayer Sermon Series. “Each Sunday during the Plebe Summer of 2013, the preacher for that week addressed one of the petitions of the Midshipman Prayer. The scripture readings were specially selected to complement and expand on the petition rather than follow the traditional Revised Common Lectionary.”
Criticism.
The Constitution establishes that there are no religious tests for office, and that the government may not make an establishment of religion. While mandatory chapel attendance at the Naval Academy ended in the 1970s, mandatory, 100% Christian noon meal prayer continues every day, and religious tracts with the Midshipman Prayer on them are passed out by uniformed Naval officers at secular USNA events. Noon meal prayer has been discontinued at USMA and USAFA. The oath of office taken by midshipmen and officers may be affirmed and is to "support and defend the Constitution," not to serve the "almighty god / thee" specified in the prayer. 
While USNA claims the Midshipman Prayer is "interfaith," the text is specific to a monotheistic abrahamic religion. Members of other traditions at USNA, such as polytheists, members of dharmic religions, atheists, freethinkers, secularists, humanists, and a small group of satanist midshipmen, are excluded. USNA so far has declined to adopt more inclusive prayers and has had exclusively Christian noon meal prayer for several years. A proposed inclusive midshipman prayer is

Married to Lionel (Wally) Naylor in 1982 with one daughter, Jacqueline (Nicki) Naylor, they pursue an active outdoor lifestyle in their free time.
Research.
Although trained as an economist, Naylor collaborates widely with scholars in the natural and physical sciences
Early work studying wheat systems.
The field of global food security and agriculture-environment interactions is vast. Naylor’s early work centered on field experiments and surveys on intensive wheat systems of the Yaqui Valley, Mexico (the home of the Green Revolution for wheat). Naylor, along with Stanford’s Pamela Matson, launched the project focused on fertilization practices in a highly intensive agricultural system, and the outcomes of such practices on farm incomes, wheat yields, and the environment. The study was followed by a decade of work in the Yaqui Valley among a growing team of faculty and students at Stanford (and partner institutions).
Orphan crops role in feeding the poor.
In addition to working on intensive, high-yield cropping systems, Naylor has researched orphan crops – classified as those that do not receive much investment and breeding effort, despite being critical for food security among the world’s poorest and most marginalized communities. In a collaborative effort she and several members of the McKnight Foundation Collaborative Crop Research Program including economists, geneticists, and ecologists addressed the question: Why are investments in biotechnology for orphan crop improvement important for food security? The research found that investments in genetic research in orphan crops can have positive spillover effects for major crops such as rice, what, and maize and vice versa. This paper was rated in the top ten "Food Policy" papers for several years following its publication.
Aquaculture.
Naylor is widely published on aquaculture-environment interactions research dating back to the late 1990s. “Effect of aquaculture on world fish supplies” represented a global analysis and synthesis of the impacts of aquaculture on ecosystems and fish supplies. Over the course of the 2000s, the work by Naylor, colleagues, and many other researchers in the aquaculture field, helped to motivate industry improvements on feed efficiency and sustainable farming practices, and provided a foundation for the expanding literature on sustainable aquaculture practices (including the introduction of the journal "Aquaculture Environment Interactions", which was launched in 2009). Naylor continues to publish on aquaculture and fisheries issues in prominent journals, and in 2017 her paper on "Opportunity for Marine Fisheries Reform in China"” with Cao et al. was nominated for the PNAS Cozzarelli Prize. In 2021, Naylor was the lead author on “A 20-year retrospective review of global aquaculture”, published in "Nature""."
Climate impacts on food security.
As the impacts of El Niño events became more prominent, Naylor examined the effects on food security in Indonesia and what the government might do to alleviate episodes of food insecurity during El Niño events. This study became a core component of Indonesia’s food security division of the Ministry of Agriculture. Naylor also conducted a study on how rising temperatures due to climate change will affect food systems and what adaptation measures will be necessary. Naylor continues to collaborate on research examining the implications of climate variability and climate change on global food security, a focus area at The Center on Food Security and the Environment.
Water resources potential in poverty alleviation.
Naylor has also focused on the potential of water resources to improve food and nutrition security. Working with FSE fellow Jennifer Burney, Naylor led a multi-year survey to measure the impacts of solar market gardens in Benin, West Africa. The introduction of distributed irrigation improved nutritional and social outcomes, and the research resulted in several publications outlining the effectiveness of the intervention including nutritional improvements, equity between and among households, marketing expansion, and educational impacts.
Improving food and nutrition security.
In a culmination of collaborative work with colleagues at Stanford over the past two decades Naylor published "The Evolving Sphere of Food Security""." Designed primarily for university teaching purposes the book provides three novel approaches to understanding global food security. First, the individual chapters show how food security is tightly linked to many other forms of security: water, health, energy, environmental, climate, and even national security. The most effective intervention points for improving food security may not be in the agricultural sector "per se", but instead in the water, energy or health sectors. Second, the chapters show that all countries, including the U.S., have food security challenges, but that the challenges change over the course of economic development. The third important aspect of the book is that it delves into food policy, integrating science and policy to understand the complex field of global food security.
Tropical Oil Crops.
As global incomes rose, diets changed, and new global food systems emerged, Naylor turned her attention toward tropical oil crop systems. She has studied the effects of biofuels on food security and the environment, the impacts of soybean production in Brazil and palm oil production across the globe. Working closely with the Stanford Graduate School of Business, Naylor and a team of Stanford faculty, scholars, and students with expertise in sustainability launched the Poverty Alleviation through Sustainable Palm Oil Production project. In 2017 Naylor co-authored "The Tropical Oil Crop Revolution" which examines the major supply and demand drivers in oil crop production; the economic, social, and environmental impacts; and the future outlook to 2050.
Blue Foods Assessment.
Naylor is now the co-chair of the Blue Foods Assessment (BFA), a comprehensive review of aquatic foods and their role in tackling food security and environmental degradation, led by a team of international researchers. The assessments includes a series of reports on topics such as nutrition, environmental impacts, and justice, and small-scale producers, that will inform policy and the 2021 United Nations Food Systems Summit. The BFA is a collaboration between the Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions, the Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment, the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment, the Stockholm Resilience Centre, the EAT Forum, and Springer Nature.
Role at Stanford.
For the past 30 years, Naylor has taught courses at Stanford including: World Food Economy, Human Society and Environmental Change, Fundamentals of Sustainable Agriculture, Food and Security, and The Evolving Sphere of Food Security. Naylor has also participated in and mentored students on numerous field-level research projects across the globe.

Kizuna AI

 is a Japanese virtual YouTuber (VTuber) currently part of Kizuna AI Inc., a subsidiary of digital entertainment company Activ8. From her debut in 2016 until 2021, she was the most subscribed VTuber on Youtube, with more than 4 million subscribers across three YouTube channels, 1 million subscribers on Chinese video platform Bilibili. Kizuna AI posted her first YouTube video on her "A.I.Channel" on 29 November 2016. A second channel, "A.I.Games", was opened in March 2017 for gaming content, and a third, "A.I.Channel China", opened in June 2019 for a Chinese audience.
Although the first channel to use a CG avatar for vlogging purposes on YouTube was the channel of English-Japanese Ami Yamato, who debuted her first video in 2011, Kizuna is the world's first virtual YouTuber with the characteristics as we know today, much like the one who coined the term Virtual YouTuber. Kizuna's video content is similar to many other YouTubers, consisting primarily of discussions, Q&amp;A videos, and more traditional "Let's Play" videos, although in years later, she also began to livestream at least one time per week. Because Kizuna primarily communicates in Japanese, fans contributed translations for her videos, and there were entire unofficial communities built around these translators, filling the void of an official English community until 2020 when official subtitles began to be done. Kizuna has performed at various anime conventions, at real concerts, and has also worked with many game companies. She has also appeared on television shows and has starred in commercials not limiting herself to YouTube, to the point of appearing in mid-Shibuya. She has become a popular virtual celebrity worldwide.
Starting in 2016, Kizuna AI was originally managed directly by Activ8, the company that created her, under the name Project A.I. In 2018, the project was moved to in-house agency upd8. Following an announcement on 24 April 2020, Activ8 announced that Kizuna AI was moved from upd8 to a new subsidiary company dedicated exclusively to her, called Kizuna AI Inc. With the announcement, Japanese voice actress Nozomi Kasuga (春日望) also disclosed her role as the voice model of Kizuna AI and advisor of the new company. Kizuna AI Inc. formally started activities on 11 May 2020, with Eriko Matsumoto (松本恵利子) as the CEO.
Production.
Kizuna is an online virtual character completely constructed using software. As the identities of producers in the background are not revealed, video animators, producers, video editors, and players of games are unknown. Kizuna's YouTube channels are thought to be managed by an entire production crew, and the choice to remain anonymous comes from the wish to keep the concept of a virtual idol intact. Though this has caused speculation regarding the operation crew and technology. Kizuna's videos are produced by Tokyo-based digital production company Activ8.
All crew members known so far to be involved in Kizuna's design are already well known. These include En Morikura in character design, Tomitake in 3D modelling, and Tda in modelling supervision. Morikura is an artist well known for illustration. Tomitake has designed many 3D models, and works alongside Tda, an expert in the MikuMikuDance 3D modelling field.
The identity of Kizuna AI's voice model had long been unknown; however, on 24 April 2020 it was announced on Twitter that voice actress Nozomi Kasuga provides her voice.
Personality.
Kizuna is aware that she is a virtual character, and claims that she is an independent artificial intelligence (hence the "AI" in her name). The main concept of a character in a virtual setting was created through Kizuna, so she is publicly recognized as the world's first "virtual YouTube user". An October 2018 article from BBC Capital noted a Mattel advertisement campaign for Barbie in 2015 with the same concept.
In her first video, Kizuna introduces herself. Apart from the general meaning of "artificial intelligence", "AI" is also a pun on the kanji "愛", meaning "love" while "Kizuna" (絆) means to bond, bind and/or connect. Kizuna is designed as a young and beautiful 2.5D animated girl with moe elements, which attracts many YouTube users. Kizuna's appearance age is roughly 16 years old, though she revealed that she is only five, with her birthday on 30 June. She has a height of 156 cm (~5'1"), a weight of roughly 46 kg (101 lbs.), and her three measurements are 85-59-83 (34-24-33).
Kizuna's overall appearance uses a pink and white color palette. She has long flowing hair, coupled with a futuristic gradient hair dye of pink. She wears a pink wobbly hairband with a butterfly knot. The hairband has a double-leaf heart-shaped design, corresponding to the word "Ai", meaning "love", in her name. Kizuna's sleeveless white top brings about a futuristic feel as well. It is designed to put emphasis on her back and body, as well as to make her appear slimmer. Embroidered above her chest is the letter "A". Her arm sleeves and thigh highs are decorated with lace, while her thigh highs and shorts form a "Zettai Ryoiki" area in her design.
Kizuna is a huge fan of "Love Live!" and "Love Live! School Idol Festival"; her favorite character is Nico Yazawa. During an interview with Panora, Kizuna mentioned that she pays close attention to idol groups such as Keyakizaka46 and Nogizaka46. Kizuna likes how idols follow their dreams just like herself. In her character design, she also likes to spend time in virtual space playing video games.
Technology used.
Kizuna is able to livestream and record videos in a virtual environment; this is generally considered to rely on the freeware MikuMikuDance. After the production crew designs a 3D model, they manually control the model to make certain movements. Then, they hire a voice actor to give the animation a voice. MikuMikuDance has often been used in the videos of Vocaloid pop music, allowing users to import and control the 3D models of virtual characters such as Hatsune Miku.
On the other hand, some netizens think that Kizuna's facial expressions and eye changes are done through facial tracking using facial recognition software such as FaceRig. The technology of FaceRig Live2D modules has already existed for a considerable amount of time. Some feel that Kizuna is a result of applying this technology to 3D models, similarly by projecting facial expressions onto a virtual reality model, thereby hiding the identities of creators and actors involved. At the same time, some think that omni-directional motion capture technology is being used. After recording the actions of real actors, this data is used to simulate movement of the character in a virtual reality setting. Both methods allow Kizuna to resemble real people more closely in terms of expressions and actions, overall making Kizuna's videos more similar to those of other female YouTubers. In 2017, Activ8 showcased a real-time animation system that enables a person to operate an animated character by attaching a sensor to the body and lip-sync the character according to the spoken words by analyzing the sound waves picked up by a microphone.
Activities.
The YouTube channel "A.I.Channel" was created on 18 October 2016, though Kizuna only started posting videos on 29 November 2016. She creates, designs and hosts a series of videos with a mix of wacky and serious elements. These videos are designed to break the boundaries between virtual and real spaces, and involves activities such as television-like show-hosting and virtual reality. The production crew also wishes for the audience to get in touch with and experience the newest technology, even allowing users to interact directly with Kizuna in virtual space.
Kizuna posts videos almost every day on YouTube, and is recognized as an active user of the video-sharing platform. With over two million subscribers as of October 2018, Kizuna is the most popular virtual personality on the site and one of its most-watched Japanese content creators. She is also gaining traction in regions around the globe.
In January 2017, Kizuna joked that because her clothes are merely holographic projections, she is technically always naked. YouTube detected the use of the word "naked" and decided that the video contained inappropriate content, so "A.I.Channel" was banned. The content had to be posted on another video sharing site, Niconico. After several weeks, the channel was unbanned in February. Despite the ban, Kizuna's popularity grew tremendously and her subscriber count reached 100,000 on 25 February.
By the end of March, Kizuna had already uploaded more than 60 videos. "A.I.Channel" had exceeded 200,000 subscribers and 5 million comments. On 31 March, Kizuna even started releasing gaming content on a new channel named "A.I.Games". "A.I.Games" was blocked for unknown reasons on 17 April but was unblocked and resumed posting videos within a day.
"A.I.Channel" reached 2 million subscribers on 15 July 2018. "A.I.Games" also reached 1 million subscribers on 14 August 2018.
Other activities.
Apart from her YouTube channels and official website, Kizuna has also created Twitter, Instagram and TikTok accounts to facilitate interaction with fans. She also holds limited-time events occasionally, such as a Valentine's Day chocolate giveaway in 2017.
Kizuna accepted an interview by PANORA, a website focusing on the topic of virtual reality. The interview was divided into four parts and posted on Kizuna AI's official website. Then, on 25 and 26 March 2017, Kizuna performed and then interacted with fans live on the stage of AnimeJapan.
In April 2017, a collaboration between Kizuna and Japanese video game development company Asobimo was announced. On the newly-created "A.I.Games" channel, Kizuna would periodically post videos of her doing a commentary while playing "Avabel Online", a MMORPG designed by Asobimo for smartphones. Kizuna would also appear directly in the game. Afterwards, there would occasionally be video advertisements for the game.
Kizuna is the ambassador for one of the Japan National Tourism Organization's "Come to Japan" campaign and appeared in endorsements for SoftBank. She has also hosted a television variety show titled , which aired on Japan's BS NTV channel from 6 April 2018. She also voiced Website Manager Hachi in the anime television series "Magical Girl Site", which aired from the same day.
To celebrate reaching 2 million subscribers on "A.I.Channel" on 15 July 2018, Kizuna released her first eurodance digital single "Hello, Morning".
On 1 March 2019, Dutch music duo W&amp;W released a song called "The Light" in which Kizuna features as a vocalist and as a dancer.
In October 2020 Active8 Inc. and Gemdrops Inc. released a rhythm VR game based on Kizuna AI called Kizuna Ai – Touch The Beat.
On 6 November 2020, she appeared as herself in season 2, episodes 4 and 5 of the Australian web series Meta Runner. In the episode, she is a guide for "Pocket Gakusei", an in-universe online anime dating simulator.
On 30 January 2021, Kizuna AI released a clothing collaboration with the Dutch streetwear brand Kaomoji.
Between March and May 2021, Kizuna AI will be holding a virtual tour with the intention of exploring and creating new virtual possibilities. This tour will consist of 2 shows, one set in Los Angeles and one set in New York. An online DJ event "CONTACT YOU presented by DJ Kizuna AI" is expected to be held by DJ Kizuna AI. Guests for the Los Angeles live show will include TeddyLoid and Nyanners who have a large number of followers in the US.
Videos.
Similar to other YouTubers, Kizuna acts as a host on her YouTube channels, creating and uploading various original types of entertainment-related videos, thereby attracting viewers to subscribe to her channels. Kizuna's videos contain much content similar to other video bloggers. Kizuna will also imitate the interesting behaviour of other YouTubers. The style of these videos is comedic and uses technology to let Kizuna move smoothly. Videos sometimes add content of a more imaginative or animated style, though bugs in the software may cause her to move rather unnaturally.
On average, Kizuna's videos are about ten minutes long. Video content includes chatting, sharing life stories, answering questions, fulfilling requests, hosting discussions on trending topics, interviews, "Let's Plays", dancing, challenges, and drawing. She has discussed artificial intelligence, virtual reality, games, things she likes, and how she wants a Wikipedia page dedicated to herself. She has also talked about buying friends with money, and what furniture she wants to have.
Games.
Kizuna often posts videos of herself giving commentaries while playing games on YouTube. As a virtual Let's Play show host, Kizuna's game operating techniques seem a little clumsy, though like other gaming YouTubers, she makes seemingly real comments and reactions to the games that she likes. The most viewed and most popular gaming video by Kizuna is her Let's Play of popular indie game "Inside".
Some of Kizuna's videos involve augmented and virtual reality games. Using omnidirectional motion capture technology, a 3D model of Kizuna playing a game can be developed. Virtual reality games played by Kizuna include extreme sports game "The Climb", first-person shooter game "Superhot", drawing software "Tilt Brush", and more. Kizuna has also attempted to describe English words in "Quick, Draw!", explore Tokyo virtually using Google Maps, and talk with other AI such as Apple's iPhone Assistant Siri.
Subtitles.
The language used in all of Kizuna's videos is Japanese. This made it difficult for a large portion of viewers to understand specific content of videos. Afterwards, "A.I.Channel" and "A.I.Games" allowed bilingual fans to translate Japanese in videos to other languages. With the help of translations offered by fans, Kizuna's channels were able to offer content in many different languages including Japanese, English, Korean, Spanish, and many others. This has allowed global audiences to understand the comments made by Kizuna in her videos, and has helped to grow her audience outside of Japan. Korean and English comments take up similar portions in the comments section of Kizuna's videos.
Impact.
Kizuna, also known, "AI-chan" among her fans, is the spearhead of the virtual YouTuber trend. Kevin Allocca, YouTube's head of cultural trends, singled out the meteoric growth of A.I. Channel over 10 months as an example of the growth of virtual personalities on the platform. Allocca also noted that the trend's popularity was mostly contained to Japan. Character designs such as Kizuna are seen as a revolutionary concept, and could be the precursor of a new trend in virtual reality, virtual YouTube users and live-streamers.
2D virtual characters such as Hatsune Miku have been getting more popular, and the audience of 2D has been widening. Therefore, the concept of Kizuna as a YouTube video host is becoming more widespread. The profession of live-streaming usually requests for the constant production of original or exclusive content for the audience, and 2D live-streaming can be a method of doing so. Also, in the regular YouTube market, virtual streaming can be an alternative for those who are unable or do not wish to reveal their face in front of the camera, because exquisite character designs can make up for the imperfections in real people. Virtual streaming also allows the production crew to create more than one character. For example, Black AI is another artificial intelligence who appears several times in Kizuna's videos, and seems to be animated in the same fashion.
"Tubefilter" writer Sam Gutelle thinks that even though characters like Kizuna may be seen as oddities now, they will become more common in the future. "The Verge" columnist Rich McCormick feels that Kizuna is different from other content creators as she can technically play games as long as she wants without the need for food and sleep. This will bring channels more flexibility, and these types of videos may even be the future of YouTube. The BBC thinks that the selling point of virtual characters is that they are not like other YouTubers, as their appearance will never age and related development is still in its beginning stages.
In 2018, Kizuna appeared on a program on NHK interviewing the Japanese Nobel Prize winners, which sparked debate on social media over female objectification, with several scholars deeming her appearance as inappropriate. Yuki Senda, a professor at Musashi University, claimed that Kizuna nodding along with the panel instead of contributing constructively to the conversation was more of an issue than her character design, due to her mannerisms reinforcing gender roles in women. Junko Saeki, a professor at Doshisha University, also suggested that Kizuna's quietness may be perpetuating a new wave of orientalism because of her role as one of Japan's primary cultural exports.
Fandom activities.
On 25 December 2016, Kizuna's producers decided to put up her MikuMikuDance 3D model for free download and edits on her official site. This was to allow interested fans to produce "doujin" products. The 3D model can be used in MikuMikuDance, Unity, Unreal Engine and other spaces. The developers even made the model compatible with virtual reality. The virtual model is allowed use in videos and games, but for business purposes it is required that the developers are contacted. Finally, the use of the model in political, racial or religious settings or to create other models is prohibited.
The derivative work of some fans is shared to the rest of the fanbase on Kizuna's social media accounts. On YouTube, there are many users who name their accounts "Kizuna AI", "" or other related names. Some repost her videos but only the official "A.I.Channel" offers subtitles for many languages. There are also dancing-related videos.

1989 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament

The 1989 Big West Conference Men's Basketball Tournament was held March 8–11 at the Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California. This was the first tournament after the Big West Conference renamed itself from the Pacific Coast Athletic Association (PCAA) in July 1988.
Top-seeded defeated in the final, 68–62, and captured their fifth PCAA/Big West championship. This was the Runnin' Rebels' fifth title in seven seasons.
The Rebels, in turn, received an automatic bid to the 1989 NCAA Tournament, where they would advance to the Elite Eight.
Format.
There were no changes to the tournament format from 1988. All ten conference members participated in the field, with teams seeded in the bracket based on regular season conference records.
The top six seeds were given a bye into the quarterfinal round while the four lowest-seeded teams were placed into an initial preliminary round.

Marriott Fawckner Nicholls

Sir Marriott Fawckner Nicholls CBE, FRCS, (12 May 1898 – 25 August 1969) was an English surgeon who specialised in the genitourinary tract. He served in the British Army in both the First and Second World Wars and was dean of the medical school at St George's Hospital for 20 years. At the age of 64 he became professor of surgery at the University of Khartoum in Sudan, where he maintained the position until his death five years later.
Early life and family.
Marriott Fawckner Nicholls was born in London on 12 May 1898, the son of Marriott Edwin Nicholls. He received his basic education at the City of London School after which he attended Clare College, Cambridge. His studies were interrupted due to the First World War during which he served in the Royal Fusiliers. He was demobilised in 1919 with the rank of captain. He finally graduated in 1921.
In 1925 he married the pathologist Norah Schuster (1892-1991). In 1939 he married Mary Edith Harrison (died 1972).
Also known as "Nick", he was fond of fishing and cricket and supported his medical school cricket club.
Career.
Nicholls undertook his clinical training at St George's Hospital, qualifying in 1923. He became a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (FRCS) in 1926, and graduated with a bachelor of surgery degree in 1928. He received a master's degree in surgery in 1932. He won the Allingham Scholarship in surgery at St George's in 1925 and the Sir Francis Laking Research Scholarship in 1928–29 and in 1929–30. Some of his happiest times were when he became assistant curator of the museum there in 1926.
He joined the consultant staff at St George's in 1932 and began a successful career in surgery with a specialism in genito-urinary work. He was visiting surgeon at the Atkinson Morley's Convalescent Hospital in 1936, replacing Bryan Burns. He was dean of the Medical School from 1936 to 1956, whilst still actively at work as a surgeon. One of his major difficulties stemmed from the move of St George's Hospital from Hyde Park Corner to Tooting, and he was successful in being the first to effectively transfer his department to this new site. He was a consultant to the Belgrave Children's Hospital and the Royal Chest Hospital and held the position of general surgeon at the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital. In addition, he was chairman of the Court of Examiners at the Royal College of Surgeons for 2 years. He also stood for the 1952 Royal College of Surgeons Council elections, however, Price Thomas received most votes. Despite this, he served on the council of the British Association of Urological Surgeons and was president of the Section of Urology of the Royal Society of Medicine in 1960–61.
He served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during the Second World War (1940-1946), starting as a lieutenant-colonel running a surgical division in Freetown, Sierra Leone, before becoming a brigadier with the Fourteenth Army, serving with South East Asia Command. He was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire in 1946.
In 1962, Nicholls became professor of surgery at the University of Khartoum, Sudan, in succession to Julian Taylor. He was knighted in 1969.
Death and legacy.
Nicholls died of coronary thrombosis in Khartoum, Sudan, on 25 August 1969. He received an obituary in "The Lancet" and is recorded in Plarr's Lives of the Fellows. The "Nicholls Ward", at St George's Hospital, London, is named in his honour.

Sextus Hermentidius Campanus

Sextus Hermentidius Campanus was a Roman senator, who was active during the Flavian dynasty. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of July to August 97 as the colleague of Lucius Domitius Apollinaris. He is known entirely from inscriptions.
His "gentilicium" "Hermentidius", derived from the god Hermes, suggests that Campanus' origins lie in Cappadocia, where there is evidence of a number of names incorporating the name of that deity. In any case, he is the only member of his family known to have acceded to the consulate.
The only office Campanus is known to have held, other than his consulate, is "legatus legionis" or commander of the Legio X Fretensis between the years 93 and 97, which was stationed during those years in Jerusalem. Command of this legion also made Campanus the de facto governor of Judea.
Edward Champlin has restored his name in the "Testamentum Dasumii", which would attest that Campanus was alive at least as late as the year 108.

Rocco is a 2016 French documentary film, co-directed by Thierry Demaizière and Alban Teurlai.
Plot.
A dive into the pornographic film industry through the eyes of Italian pornographic actor, producer, and director Rocco Siffredi.
Reception.
Boyd van Hoeij from The Hollywood Reporter, called it a "fascinating and beautifully crafted work that tries to paint a nuanced picture of the man himself and, to an extent, the industry in which he worked" E. Nina Rothe from The Huffington Post, wrote: "From its opening shot, it’s clear that Rocco is not a film for the faint of heart. It is raw, hard-core, violent and savage. And yet, hidden beneath this world of porn and Rocco Siffredi — the film’s anti-hero with a Faustian secret — lies a message about how empowered we each are, when it comes to our own sexuality."
Rocco won the "NIN Award" at the FEST International Film Festival.

Isaac Buxton

Isaac Buxton (6 May 1773 – 1 July 1825) was an English physician who specialised in the treatment of asthma, consumption and other pulmonary diseases. In 1814 he founded an eight-bed infirmary that became the Royal Chest Hospital.
Early life.
Isaac Buxton was born on 6 May 1773 in Grange Walk, Bermondsey. He was a foundation scholar at St Paul's School and then was apprenticed for five years to his brother-in-law, a seed merchant named Wrench.
He was probably a dissenter and may have practiced as a dissenting minister but the evidence in unclear. In 1800 he went to the University of Göttingen to study medicine under J. F. Blumenbach. He acquired his doctorate in 1802, with a thesis likely to have been on a study of man as a ruminant, a topic possibly inspired by the enthusiasm in Göttingen at the time for comparative anatomy. While there he took the medical oath.
Buxton married Janet Travers, the first cousin of the surgeon Benjamin Travers.
Career.
On his return to London in 1802, Buxton became dresser to Astley Cooper at Guy's Hospital and in 1805 received his medical licence from the Royal College of Physicians. He then spent time at the Surrey Dispensary in south London where records indicate there was "no rowdiness" in his clinics. He was then elected physician to the London Hospital in 1807 and began a successful practice in New Broad Street. He also promoted the chest hospital in Spitalfields.
In 1810 he wrote an essay on heating and ventilation for invalids, the deficiency of which he had experienced during his time in Germany. It included a case study sent in by Edward Jenner and was abstracted in a French journal. The essay features in two histories of heating and ventilating. The topic preoccupied him at a time when it was not a common concern among physicians and he tried to keep his sick rooms at a constant temperature of 60-65 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter months for any patient with a cough or consumption.
In 1817 and 1818 an outbreak of fever in London's East End was causing concern at the London Hospital over the number of cases they were receiving. Buxton went back over the records of the last 70 years and compiled statistics showing the trend of admissions to the hospital from the disease. He concluded that although there had been a recent increase, the long term trend in cases was down.
In 1814 he founded the Infirmary for Asthma, Consumption and other Pulmonary Diseases which subsequently became the Royal Chest Hospital. At first it had only eight beds and Buxton was its only physician for the first six years of its existence. It was located in Union Street, Spitalfields, before moving to City Road in 1849. He was elected to the Hunterian Society council in its second year but did not attend any meetings due to ill health. He retired for health reasons in 1822.
Death and legacy.
Buxton died on 1 July 1825 at Grosvenor Place, in Camberwell, and was buried in Bunhill Fields. He was criticised in E. W. Morris's "History of the London Hospital" (2nd edit., London, 1910) for having arranged his election to the London Hospital by some sort of trick but Norah Schuster writes in her article on Buxton's life that she found no evidence to support that claim or other criticisms of Buxton's character.

Gladys Chesir Kiptagelai

Gladys Chesir Kiptagelai (born 20 February 1993) is a Kenyan female long-distance runner who competes over distances from 3000 metres up to the marathon. She was a gold medallist at the Youth Olympics and a silver medallist at the African Games in 2015.
Career.
Chesir won her first international medal at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, where she topped the podium in the 3000 m. This was Kenya's first ever medal at the new competition. She began to make her mark as a senior around late 2014 in road running events, having top three finishes at the Zevenheuvelenloop, Egmond Half Marathon and World 10K Bangalore. She set a personal best in the half marathon in Yangzhou, running a time of 1:09:17 hours. After a third place finish at the Kenyan Athletics Championships, she was chosen for the 10,000 metres at the 2015 African Games and ultaimtely won a silver medal on her senior international debut, behind compatriot Alice Aprot Nawowuna. Her ability was further proved with a win at the Grand 10 Berlin, where she moved up to ninth on the all-time 10K run lists with a time of 30:41 minutes.
Chesir continued to improve with a time of 68:36 minutes for third at the Delhi Half Marathon, then 66:57 minutes for fifth at the RAK Half Marathon. This led to her selection for the 2016 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, where she was sixth in a time of 68:46, but outside of the team rankings behind compatriots Peres Jechirchir, Cynthia Jerotich, and Mary Wacera Ngugi, who swept the top three positions. She placed third in the 10,000 m at the 2016 Athletics Kenya Olympic Trials, but did not get added to the Kenyan team as she had not achieved the required qualification time. She continued on the roads, with top five finishes in Delhi, Copenhagen, and Prague before winning the Lille Half Marathon with her second fastest ever time at that point with 67:49 minutes.
Chesir had her marathon debut in October 2017, and gave a strong performance with 2:24:51 hours for the runner-up spot at the top level marathon behind Ethiopian Tadelech Bekele.

Conrad Malaspina (The Old)

Conrad Malaspina, also known as L’Antico or The Old was an Italian nobleman who lived in the 12th century.
There is no certainty about Conrad's birthdate but most historians agree that it is around 1180, his death date is also uncertain but it is speculated to be around July 1254.
Conrad was the forefather of the "Spino Secco" ("dried thorn" in English) branch of the Malaspina family.
Conrad Malaspina's achievements were of fundamental importance for the way Italian territories were shaped.
He had very close relationships with Emperor Frederick II as well as many intellectuals and political figures of the time. 
Biography.
He was born approximately around 1180, his father was Obizzo II Malaspina (died circa 1193).
He started his diplomatic career in 1198 when he himself confirmed the attornment of the knolls of the “Court of Gondola” to the city of Piacenza.
The juridical procedures needed for this attornment had started to be composed years before by his uncles Alberto Malaspina and Morroello Malaspina.
His diplomatic career hence began under the supervision of his uncles, who, until he turned 18, were acting in his name, he also worked alongside his cousins, they were tied by their common ancestor, the marques Obizzo I. 
In the period they worked together they had an intense diplomatic activity trying to solve the contrasts that arose with the Count-Bishop of the diocese of “Luni”, consequentially they signed agreements with the cities of Genoa, Milan, Piacenza, Tortona and Modena.
The controversy with the Count-Bishop of the diocese of “Luni”.
Starting from the last decade of the XIIIth century the Malaspina family began to have some contrasts with the Count-Bishop of the diocese of “Luni” because of the considerable richness in lands they had acquired from the d’Este family, that had previously stolen them from the da Vezzano family.
By 1202 a compromise was found: the parties agreed on reciprocal defense within the borders of the diocese of “Luni” as well as the equal division of the contended lands, under the promise that the bishop would pay an initial amount of money plus a yearly tax.
Other Agreements.
Between 1210 and 1218 Conrad signed several agreements.
Between 1210 and 1212 he signed pacts with Piacenza, Milan and Tortona to ensure the safety of Lombard merchants traveling on the Apennine roads.
The Malaspina family was a strong supporter of Emperor Otto von Brunswick in his contrast against pope Innocent the third, Pavia and the marquessate of Monferrato.
Even if Emperor Otto von Brunswick lost in the battle of Bouvines in 1214 the Malaspina family kept fighting against Pavia, which was impeding pilgrims from reaching Rome, siding with Milan and afterwards Piacenza.
Between 1215 and 1216 Conrad tried to seize some strategic positions on the eastern coast of Liguria thus causing Genoa to react.
On both the Genovese and Pavia’s front peace was achieved between 1217 and 1218.
The birth of the “Spino Secco” branch.
Between April and August 1221 Conrad and his cousin Obizzo, son of Conrad’s uncle Gugliemo, carried out the first separation of the family’s patrimonial assets.
The Malaspina’s family domain was divided in two parts, one belonged to Conrad, who is the founder of the Spino Secco branch, the other belonged to Obizzo, who started the Spino Fiorito branch (Blooming Thorn).
Such division was preceded by the preventive splitting of Alberto Malaspina’s heredity between uncle Guglielmo Malaspina and Conrad.
Upon request, Emperor Frederic the second in 1220 confirmed the validity of the solution regarding the division of the land owned by Conrad and Obizzo in the territories of Liguria, Lombardy and of Lunigiana.
Conrad was entrusted with lands in the “Appennino Lombardo”, amongst which: Val Trebbia (valley of the river Trebbia) and the castle of Pregola; in Lunigiana he occupied Mulazzo and the lands on the right of the Magra river.
The relationship with Emperor Frederick the second.
The relationship Conrad and his cousin Obizzo started with Emperor Frederick II was very prolific, even though they didn’t have a prominent position in his court, they followed him in northern and central Italy during his campaigns.
Conrad was at Frederick’s side in the battles of Monterosi (1220), Capua (1222) and Pontremoli (1226).
Conrad’s alliance with Frederick II was briefly interrupted in 1226, because the two cousins sided with Milan and Piacenza, against the Emperial Party.
While Obizzo’s schism lasted even after the conflict, after a few months, Conrad went back to the emperor’s side.
Hence in 1248 Frederick II gave all the Lunigiana to Pisa, except for Conrad’s land and the castle of Pontremoli, to thank him for his loyalty.
After the emperor’s death (1250), Conrad went back to his family and managing his possessions, he then helped the Spino Fiorito branch to reestablish its position of power, as reported in a document stating that in 1253 the two cousins occupied for a short period Pontremoli.
After July 1254 there are no documents about Conrad’s actions but it is known that in 1259 his wife (at the time) Agnesina was widowed (implying his death to be between 1254 and 1259).
Marriage and Offspring.
Conrad had 7 children in total: Moroello, Franceschino, Albert, Manfredi, Federico, Selvaggia and Beatrice, he also raised as his own the illegitimate child of his cousin Frederik I Malaspina, Conrad Malaspina (the young) (also known as Corradino).
His first wife is thought to be Costanza (daughter of Frederick II) but there is no written document confirming this, in 1259 the existence of a new consort is confirmed, Agnesina.
The Malaspina family and Patronage.
The common management of the family’s assets and the political strategies, pursued by Conrad, and his uncles Alberto and Guglielmo Malaspina, reflected the spirit of the courtly period in which the family lived.
The Malaspina family became patron to several Provençal Troubadours that were travelling to the northern Italian courts.
Some of the most famous were: Raimbaut de Vaqueiras, Aimeric de Pegulhan, Abertet de Sisteron and Guilhelm de la Tor.
To the family members were dedicated several songs, sirventes and tensos, many of which had a political topic.
Dante’s Homage.
In the eighth chant of the Purgatory, Dante Alighieri celebrates their courtly values, especially liberality and hospitality, that were well known in the entirety of Europe.
Original version.
La fama che la vostra casa onora,grida i segnori e grida la contrada,sì che ne sa chi non vi fu ancora;
e io vi giuro, s’io di sopra vada,che vostra gente onrata non si sfregiadel pregio de la borsa e de la spada.
English translation.
"“Oh!” said I then to him, “I ’ve never beenin your domains, but where throughout all Europedwelleth a man who knows them not? The famewhich honoreth your house, proclaims its lords,proclaims its district, so that even heknows of them, who hath never been there yet.I swear to you, so may I go on high,that of the glorious use of purse and swordyour honored race doth not despoil itself.")

2017 Moscow municipal elections

The 2017 Moscow municipal elections took place in Moscow on 10 September 2017. Elections took place for deputies of the municipal councils in 124 of 125 districts of Moscow and in one administrative okrug, for a total of 1,502 seats, which were contested by around 7,500 candidates. The voter turnout was 14.82%. Although the post of municipal council member is relatively powerless, candidates for mayor of Moscow are required to obtain support from municipal deputies to stand in elections.
While United Russia gained the majority with 1,153 seats, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (KPRF) was replaced in second place by the liberal opposition party Yabloko with 176 seats. The Communist Party only received 44 seats, while 108 went to independents, ten to A Just Russia, five to the Party of Growth, four to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), and two to the People's Freedom Party (PARNAS). Because of the large number of seats that went to opposition parties and independents, and the fact that in several districts they obtained the majority, the elections were regarded as progress for the liberal opposition in Russia. Dmitry Gudkov, opposition politician and former member the State Duma who organized the effort to get opposition candidates on the municipal councils, stated that "our victory wasn't complete, but it is a victory."
Results.
Overview.
In multiple districts in the center of Moscow as well as some on the periphery of the city, the ruling party United Russia suffered defeats to opposition candidates, who in total received a combined total of nearly 20% of the seats. The opposition had formed a coalition called 'United Democrats' to get candidates elected to municipal councils of deputies.
In the Gagarinsky District, where President Vladimir Putin voted, twelve out of the twelve seats went to members of the liberal party Yabloko. In the Tverskoy District, where the Moscow Kremlin is located, Yabloko received ten of the twelve seats.
Dmitry Gudkov stated after the municipal election that his intent was to run for mayor of Moscow in the 2018 election, but Yabloko did not pass the minimum requirement for the municipal filter, according to Moscow Election Commission.

Sandra Elaine Greene

Sandra Elaine Greene is an historian of West Africa and professor. She is Stephen '59 and Madeline '60 Anbinder Professor of African History and Chair of the History Department at Cornell University.
Early life.
Greene grew up in southwestern Ohio; her interest in education was encouraged by her mother, an elementary school teacher. Greene expected to study medicine, but found herself drawn to textual analysis as an undergraduate and ultimately majored in philosophy at Kalamazoo College. She also studied abroad in University of Ghana, Legon via a program that had influenced her choice to enroll at Kalamazoo, then one of the only colleges in the U.S. to offer study abroad in Africa. Her study abroad experience as well as the late Civil Rights Movement and rising Black Power movement on-going while she was an undergraduate in the late 1960s and early 1970s confirmed Greene's decision to pursue African history for her graduate work.

Davies Commission Inquiry

The Davies Commission Inquiry or Davies Commission Inquiry into the Death of Frank Paul (2007 - 2011) was an inquiry under Commissioner William H. Davies a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC), Canada. The final report was submitted in May 2011. 
Context.
Davies, who had served as Supreme Court of British Columbia (BCSC) from 1982 until his retirement in 1999, was called from his retirement to act as Commissioner of the Davies Commission Inquiry in 2007. 
The Inquiry focused on the 1998 death by hypothermia of Frank Paul, a homeless Mi'kmaq man originally from Elsipogtog First Nation, New Brunswick. According to the report, Paul died of hypothermia in an alley in east side Vancouver where he had been released by Vancouver police. 
Interim Report (2009).
In his 446-page report, which was published on February 12, 2009, Justice Davies was "harshly critical" of the actions of Vancouver Police Department (VPD) in relation to Paul's death.
Alone and Cold (2011).
In his May 2011 report, "Alone and Cold: Criminal Justice Branch Response", he questioned the decision "on the part of the crown prosecutors to not proceed with criminal charges against Sergeant Sanderson and Constable Instant in the death of Frank Paul." Davies "ruled that the B.C.’s Criminal Justice Branch needed an overhaul to its conflict-of-interest policies that were brought up during the inquiry" The Inquiry "resulted in the recommendation to establish the Independent Investigations Office which investigates officer-related incidents of death or serious harm in BC."

The Copa América of Beach Soccer (named natively in Spanish as the "Copa América de Fútbol Playa") is a biennial international beach soccer tournament contested between the senior men's national teams of the 10 members of CONMEBOL. It is beach soccer's version of the better known "Copa América" in its parent sport, association football.
Along with the longer running World Cup qualification tournament, it is one of the main two beach soccer championships disputed exclusively by South American national teams.
The tournament is organised by the governing body for football in South America, CONMEBOL, who established the event in 2016 following their declaration of commitment a year prior, to develop beach soccer on the continent. Exhibition-style events also held under the "Copa América" title took place in 1994–99, 2003 and 2012–14, but this fully competitive incarnation of the Copa América is the first to be officially sanctioned and organised by CONMEBOL, who also organise the other official Copa América events in association football and futsal.

Liz MacDonald

Elizabeth MacDonald is a space weather scientist who works at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. She is a co-investigator on the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron Spectrometer on the NASA Radiation Belts Storm Probe mission.
Education.
Elizabeth MacDonald was born in Walla Walla, Washington, to Bill and Alice MacDonald. MacDonald received a BSc in physics from the University of Washington, funded by a NASA Space Grant scholarship, in 1999. Her mentor, Ruth Skoug, encouraged her to remain in research. MacDonald completed her postgraduate studies at the University of New Hampshire, earning her PhD in physics in 2004.
Career.
MacDonald specializes in plasma mass spectrometry, and has 23 years of expertise in instrument development and data analysis and interpretation.
After completing her PhD, MacDonald joined Los Alamos National Laboratory. At LANL she was the Principal Investigator for the Z-Plasma Spectrometer on the Department of Energy Space and Atmospheric Burst Reporting System geosynchronous payload. She also led the "Innovative Research and Integrated Sensing" team. She was principal investigator for the Advanced Miniaturized Plasma Spectrometer. She received the Los Alamos Awards Program recognition three times.
Between 2009 and 2011 she led the Department of Energy funded "Modular Advanced Space Environment Instrumentation". In 2012 she became a New Mexico Consortium-affiliated researcher, working on the prototype for the Aurorasaurus citizen science project. She has served on scientific review panels for the National Science Foundation and Los Alamos National Laboratory grants. Today MacDonald works in the Goddard Space Flight Center.
In 2018 MacDonald and her team announced the discovery of a new aurora called Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE). STEVE is farther from the poles than the aurora is typically seen. The European Space Agency Swam A satellite was used to identify that the charged particles in STEVE were around 6000 °C. It was observed by Canadian aurora enthusiasts in 2015. MacDonald attributes the faint purple glow to a subauroral ion drift. MacDonald published the finding in "Science". She is working with NASA to crowd source sightings of STEVE.
Awards and honors.
In 2018, MacDonald was named as a Walla Walla Public Schools Graduate of Distinction as a "pioneer in citizen science initiatives and mentor for aspiring scientists of all ages""."
Public engagement.
In 2016 in the journal Space Weather, MacDonald and co-workers reported that "citizen scientists are regularly able to spot auroras farther south of an area where prediction models indicated". MacDonald leads an interdisciplinary citizen science project called Aurorasaurus, which uses social media to predict the Northern Lights during the current solar maximum. To fund the program, she won a $1-million INSPIRE grant from the National Science Foundation together with Andrea Tapia of Pennsylvania State University and Michelle Hall of Science Education Solutions.
After noticing a spike in tweets about an aurora borealis in October 2011, she established Aurorasaurus to track such geolocation information in order to improve forecasting, such as that done by NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center.
In August 2017, she spoke at the Carl Sandburg Home National Historic Site about the 2017 solar eclipse. MacDonald regularly speaks to high school students and community groups.

Russian gunboat Sivuch (1884)

Sivuch (Russian - Сивуч; "sealion") was a "Sivuch"-class gunboat of the Imperial Russian Navy. She entered service in 1884 and was powered by sail and steam. She took an active role in mapping the northern Pacific Ocean and nearby seas as well as periodically being stationed in Chinese and Korean ports and protecting seal rookeries, principally from American poachers. She also took part in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion (1899–1901).
"Sivuch" spent the winter of 1903-1904 iced in with the Royal Navy sloop-of-war and a United States Navy gunboat at Newchwang at the mouth of the Liao River on the Gulf of Pechili coast of Manchuria. The three vessels were there when the Russo-Japanese War broke out in February 1904. When the ice broke up in the spring of 1904, "Espiegle" and the U.S. Navy gunboat left, but "Sivuch" remained. Newchwang and the Liao River were in Chinese territory, so initially the Russians disarmed "Sivuch" in recognition of Chinese neutrality, but as their concern over the possibility of a Japanese landing in the vicinity of Newchwang grew, they occupied the Newchwang area and rearmed "Sivuch". "Sivuch"′s presence at Newchwang and on the Liao River was a matter of concern to the Imperial Japanese Navy during the early months of the war. As Imperial Japanese Army forces advanced on Newchwang and the Liao River in the summer of 1904, her presence became a concern for Japanese ground forces as well. 
Imperial Japanese Army cavalry occupied Newchwang on 25 July 1904, and "Sivuch" withdrew up the Liao River accompanied by a flotilla of four armed steam launches. On 1 August 1904, an Imperial Japanese Navy force consisting of the gunboats "Atago", "Tsukushi", and "Uji" and a division of torpedo boats arrived at the mouth of the Liao River with orders to assist the Japanese Second Army in guarding the river and to destroy "Sivuch" and her accompanying launches if possible. With "Sivuch" trapped in the upper reaches of the river by superior Japanese forces, her crew scuttled her by blowing her up on 2 August 1904.

Pinewood Hospital

The Pinewood Hospital was a hospital in Pinewood, near Crowthorne, England, for the treatment of people suffering from tuberculosis. It was located in a pine wood as pine trees were thought to be beneficial in the treatment of the disease. It opened as the London Open Air Sanatorium in 1901 before becoming the Pinewood Sanatorium. It treated casualties of the First and Second World Wars and after the second, began to treat general thoracic patients as tuberculosis became less prevalent. It closed in 1966.
History.
The London Open Air Sanatorium was opened by the National Association for the Prevention of Tuberculosis in 1901 for the treatment of tuberculosis patients. They had purchased the 82-acre site in 1898, following a meeting convened at Marlborough House by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII). It was sited in a pine forest at Pine Wood (later Pinewood) in Berkshire as pine trees were thought to be beneficial for tuberculosis patients, and initially accommodated 64 male patients.
During the First World War the sanatorium was used to treat victims of gas warfare.
The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913, authorised the Metropolitan Asylums Board to treat those with tuberculosis. They acquired the organisation in 1919 and renamed it Pinewood Sanatorium. It opened on 7 July 1919.
The Metropolitan Asylums Board was taken over by the London County Council in 1929 and the sanatorium became a Special Hospital under the council's public health department. During the Second World War, it took some civilians, but was used predominantly for servicemen and by the Canadian Red Cross and Air Force who enlarged it by building wooden huts.
After the war, it became a cottage hospital. In 1952, a student rehabilitation unit was opened at the hospital. Up to 18 male students with tuberculosis from around the British Isles were offered convalescence in a "detached and self-contained ward". Entry criteria included being full-time, male and non-infectious, that is, sputum culture negative. The student patients were visited by their tutors so that their studies were not interrupted. In the main building, the first floor was used as the women's ward while the ground floor was used for surgical cases and the men accommodated in wooden huts.
In 1954, Norah Schuster set up the first pathology department at the hospital, in a wooden hut adapted for the purpose, as tuberculosis became less prevalent and the hospital began to see more patients with general thoracic disease. For instance, over three years the hospital saw about 20 cases of aspergillosis. In 1960, the hospital had 230 beds including a specialist unit for bronchitis patients and the student unit.
Buildings.
The main buildings were laid out to form a south-facing arc with a medical residence in the middle and two-storey wings with 16 rooms per floor, each with large windows to provide patients with light and fresh air. At the back was a corridor allowing access to toilets and a kitchen, and a dining-hall which was also used for recreation. The kitchens and female staff accommodation was to the north with the disinfecting rooms, laundry, and boiler-house. To the east was an isolation block reserved for cases of acute exanthemata. Patients were charged three guineas per week and typically stayed for at least six months.
Clinical staff.
Pathologist Norah Schuster worked at Pinewood Hospital from 1954 until her retirement in 1959.
Lauriston Elgie Shaw, an anatomy demonstrator who played an active part in the origins of the National Insurance Act 1911, became manager of the Metropolitan Asylums Board in 1916 and was chair of Pinewood Sanatorium sub-committee.
Closure.
The last patient left in January 1966. A proposal that the hospital should be turned into a detention centre did not go ahead. The building known as Canada House was sold to Hewlett Packard and other buildings and land to the local authority. In 2011, efforts were underway to turn the remains of the hospital into a museum.

Kosmos 154

Kosmos 154 ( meaning "Cosmos 154"), also known as L-1 No.3P, was a Soviet test spacecraft launched from the Baikonur aboard a Proton-K rocket. It was a prototype Soyuz 7K-L1 launched by Proton. It was a crewed precursor to the Zond series.
History.
The spacecraft was designed to launch a crew from the Earth to conduct a flyby of the Moon and return to Earth. The primary focus was a Soviet circumlunar flight, which help document the Moon, and also show Soviet power. The test ran from the Zond program from 1967-1970, which produced multiple failures in the 7K-L1's re-entry systems. The remaining 7K-L1s were scrapped, ultimately replaced by the Soyuz 7K-L3.
Objectives.
Two test flights of the UR-500K/L1 system were performed in March and April 1967 under the designations Kosmos 146 and Kosmos 154. In April 1967, under the cover name Kosmos-154, the third model of the L-1 was placed into near-Earth orbit. Because of a control system failure that resulted in the premature jettisoning of the ullage motors, the main propulsion system of the Block-D did not ignite. Kosmos 154 was one of the first Zond attempts. It was supposed to flyby the Moon but achieved Earth orbit only.
Mission.
Kosmos 154 was launched using a Proton-K carrier rocket, which flew from Site 81/23 at Baikonur. The launch occurred at 09:07 GMT on 8 April 1967. Kosmos 154 was operated in an Earth orbit, it had a perigee of , an apogee of , an inclination of 51.6° and an orbital period of 88.5 minutes. Kosmos 154 had a mass of .
Kosmos 154 reached Earth orbit but the Blok D translunar injection stage failed to fire (ullage rockets, which had to fire to settle propellants in tanks before the main engine fired, were jettisoned prematurely). Kosmos 154 burned up two days later when orbit decayed, on 10 April 1967.

Marguerite Wyke

Marguerite Wyke OBE (May 1908 – 1995) was an African-American-born Trinidadian teacher, poet, artist and politician. After growing up in Jersey City, New Jersey, and working as a teacher, she married and moved to Canada for a decade and then relocated to Trinidad. Writing for various journals and newspapers, and cultivating the artistic community in Trinidad, she became active in local politics. Renouncing her U. S. citizenship, Wyke became a Trinidadian citizen in 1953 and became active in the island's governance. With the establishment of the West Indies Federation she was appointed as one of two Senators from Trinidad and Tobago and one of only two women Senators to serve in the Federal Parliament of the West Indies Federation. When the Federation dissolved, Wyke returned to her artistic endeavors, publishing poetry and participating in various art media.
Early life.
Marguerite N. Abrams was born in May 1908 in New Jersey to Jessie B. M. (née Wardlaw) and James Edward Abrams. She was the oldest child of the Pullman porter, James, having younger siblings James Jr. and Bessie (or Jessie). Abrams graduated from Lincoln High School in 1926 and then went on to study at New York University. Simultaneously taking art courses at the Grand Central School of Art, she graduated with a degree in English literature. Continuing her studies, Abrams completed a teaching degree at the New Jersey State Normal School at Jersey City.
Career.
By 1929, Abrams was working as a teacher in the Jersey City Public School System. Abrams began publishing poetry, in such journals as "Opportunity Magazine" and taught until her marriage on 18 February 1933 to David Arnold Wyke. He was a Trinidadian physician who at the time of their marriage was working in Toronto, Ontario, Canada as the only black physician in the city. The young couple moved to Toronto after their marriage where David continued his work as a doctor and Marguerite continued publishing, contributing to the "Canadian Forum". The couple were part of the politically active West Indian community living in Toronto. While her husband was politically conservative, Wyke's politics were leftist and she joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) while living in Canada.
In 1946, the couple relocated to Trinidad, where Wyke became affiliated with the Caribbean Socialist Party. Continuing her writing, she published articles for "The Teachers Herald", the journal of the Teacher's Economic and Cultural Association (TECA). In 1952, she and her husband traveled to Europe for further education. While he studied in Scotland, she attended courses at the Sorbonne in Paris and also studied under Étienne Martin at the Académie Ronson. Wyke also took courses and graduated from the University of the West Indies. She actively cultivated development of the arts in Trinidad, serving as a committee member of the Trinidad and Tobago Art Society, of which she became vice president in 1956. She brought artists and writers, like Karl Broodhagen and Langston Hughes to Trinidad.
In 1953, Wyke renounced her US citizenship to become a Trinidadian citizen, with the intent of helping Eric Williams in his rise to prominence. She was involved in the PNM from early days, making speeches, serving on committees and writing for the newspaper. In the mid-1950s, she worked with working-class women through the projects of the Women's League for the People's National Movement (PNM). She assisted in the compilation of reports evaluating the Trinidadian economy and society and served on the committee which analyzed appointing West Indians to positions to govern their own affairs. During the same time frame, Wyke worked on the planning of the Caribbean Festival of the Arts and made several trips to other islands to attend music and art festivals.
When the West Indies Federation was established in 1958, Wyke was appointed as one of the two women Senators to serve in the national parliament of the new federal state. Wyke represented Trinidad and Tobago along with Deonarayan Maharajh and the other woman Senator was Bertha Higgins of Antigua and Barbuda. She actively pursued legislation to secure the rights of West Indians, working on legislation to fight racism, including urging the British parliament to protect Caribbeans living in Britain and protect workers from exploitative recruitment policies. Wyke was opposed to free movement among the Caribbean islands, fearing that large influxes of people would over-tax limited resources. She also worked to establish the first art scholarships on the island to help young artists gain their education and protested the use of women in beauty contests held to improve tourism prospects.
After her service in the Senate, Wyke returned to artistic pursuits and promoting development of the arts, as well as heritage protection programs. In 1961, she exhibited works for the opening of Nina's Art Gallery, one of the first galleries to open in Trinidad. She was chair of the committee organized to prepare for the celebrations of Trinidad and Tobago's Independence, which featured a calypso competition. Wyke was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1963 for her service to Trinidad as chair of the Independence Celebrations Committee. In the 1970s, Wyke served as the chair of the advisory board to the Central Library of Trinidad and Tobago.
In her lifetime, though Wyke worked in multiple artistic media, including fused glass, mosaic, painting, and pottery, she was most known for her sculpture. She produced works which are held in private collections throughout the Caribbean, Canada, Denmark and the United States.
Death and legacy.
Wyke died around 1995. In 2002, the Cultural Center Art Gallery of the Inter-American Development Bank in Port of Spain, hosted an art exhibition for the country's 40th anniversary of independence. Wyke was one of several featured artists included in the show.

Lima Group

The Lima Group (GL; Spanish and , French: Groupe de Lima) is a multilateral body that was established following the Lima Declaration on 8 August 2017 in the Peruvian capital of Lima, where representatives of 12 countries met in order to establish a peaceful exit to the ongoing crisis in Venezuela.
Among other issues, the group demands the release of political prisoners, the end of human rights violations, calls for free elections, offers humanitarian aid and criticizes the breakdown of democratic order in Venezuela under Nicolás Maduro.
Background.
Following the death of President Hugo Chávez, Venezuela faced a severe socioeconomic crisis during the Presidency of his successor Nicolás Maduro, as a result of their policies. Due to the state's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and chronic shortages of basic goods attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls, civil insurrection in Venezuela culminated in the 2014–17 protests. Protests occurred over the years, with demonstrations occurring in various intensities depending on the crises Venezuelans were facing at the time and the perceived threat of being repressed by authorities.
The discontent with the United Socialist Party of Venezuela saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1999 following the 2015 Parliamentary Election. As a result of that election, the lame duck National Assembly consisting of United Socialist officials filled the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal (TSJ) with allies. Into early 2016, the Supreme Court alleged that voting irregularities occurred in the 2015 Parliamentary Elections and stripped four Assembly members of their seats, preventing an opposition supermajority in the National Assembly which would be able to challenge President Maduro. The Assembly nevertheless swore in 3 of the members in question, in response to which the Supreme Court ruled that the Assembly was in contempt of court and in violation of the constitutional order. The TSJ court then began to approve multiple actions performed by Maduro and granted him more powers.
After facing years of crisis, the Venezuelan opposition pursued a recall referendum against President Maduro, presenting a petition to the National Electoral Council (CNE) on 2 May 2016. By August 2016, the momentum to recall President Maduro appeared to be progressing, with the Council setting a date for the second phase of collecting signatures, though it made the schedule strenuous, stretching the process into 2017 which made it impossible for the opposition to activate new Presidential Elections. On 21 October 2016, the Council suspended the referendum only days before preliminary signature-gatherings were to be held. The Council blamed alleged voter fraud as the reason for the cancellation of the referendum. International observers criticized the move, stating that CNE's decision made Maduro look as if he were seeking to rule as a dictator.
Days after the recall movement was cancelled, 1.2 million Venezuelans protested throughout the country against the move, demanding President Maduro to leave office, with Caracas protests remaining calm while protests in other federal states resulted in clashes between demonstrators and authorities, leaving one policeman dead, 120 injured and 147 arrested. That day the opposition gave President Maduro a deadline of 3 November 2016 to hold elections, with opposition leader, Miranda Governor Henrique Capriles stating, "Today we are giving a deadline to the Government. I tell the coward who is in Miraflores ... that on 3 November the Venezuelan people are coming to Caracas because we are going to Miraflores".
Days later on 1 November 2016, then National Assembly President and opposition leader Henry Ramos Allup announced the cancellation of 3 November march to the Miraflores presidential palace, with Vatican-led dialogue between the opposition and the government beginning. By 7 December 2016, dialogue halted between the two and two months later on 13 January 2017 after talks stalled, the Vatican officially pulled out of the dialogue. Further protests were much smaller due to the fear of repression, with the opposition organizing surprise protests instead of organized mass marches.
Other actions by President Maduro and his Bolivarian officials included a 7 February 2017 meeting which announced the creation of the "Great Socialist Justice Mission" which had the goal of establishing "a great alliance between the three powers, the judiciary, the citizen and the executive", with Maduro stating that "we have been fortunate to see how the judicial power has been growing and perfecting, carrying a doctrine so complete with the constitution of 1999" while stating that the opposition-led National Assembly "took power not for the majority not for the people but for themselves".
History.
The Lima Declaration.
The Lima Declaration established outlines and goals of the Lima Group in their attempt to mediate the crisis in Venezuela.
2018 Venezuelan presidential election.
The Lima Group has overtly condemned the presidential elections called for by the Bolivarian government, describing them as unobserved, unjust and undemocratic. Days before the planned election date, the Lima Group – alongside the United States and the European Union – called for the cancellation of the election and prepared for responses should the election be held. Following the election which strengthened President Maduro's position, the fourteen member nations of the Lima Group recalled their ambassadors from Venezuela.
2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis.
During the presidential crisis, the Representative of Peru in the United Nations Security Council condemned what was described as an "illegitimate socialist regime," stating "We have received 700,000 Venezuelan refugees and migrants due to the crisis that is the responsibility of Maduro." During the 2019 Venezuela uprising, groups members Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay and Peru supported Guaidó's actions and condemned the actions of "the illegitimate and dictatorial regime of Nicolás Maduro."
On 4 February 2019, in a meeting in Canada, it was agreed to include Juan Guaidó's interim government as a member of the Lima Group. Previously, Guaidó has designated Julio Borges as ambassador of the Lima Group. On the day of Maduro's second inauguration as president of Venezuela (10 January), Canada's Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland, one of the leading voices in the Lima Group, issued a statement that summarizes the Canadian government's position on Venezuela: "Today, Nicolás Maduro's regime loses any remaining appearance of legitimacy. Having seized power through fraudulent and anti-democratic elections held on 20 May 2018, the Maduro regime is now fully entrenched as a dictatorship. The suffering of Venezuelans will only worsen should he continue to illegitimately cling to power. Together with other likeminded countries in the Lima Group, Canada rejects the legitimacy of the new presidential term of Nicolás Maduro. We call on him to immediately cede power to the democratically-elected National Assembly until new elections are held, which must include the participation of all political actors and follow the release of all political prisoners in Venezuela."
Membership.
Twelve countries initially signed the declaration: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru. Guyana, Saint Lucia, Belize, Bolivia and Haiti joined later.
Observers and support.
The organization is supported by Barbados, the United States, Ecuador, Grenada, Jamaica and Uruguay, who attended the initial meeting, as well as organizations such as the Organization of American States and the European Union. In addition, the Venezuelan opposition has given their support.
The Lima Group supported the sanctions Panama placed against high-level Venezuelan officials, which the Panamanian government accused of money laundering, supporting terrorism and the funding of weapons of mass destruction, and defended Panama after the Bolivarian government retaliated.
Argentina's Peronist government, headed by Alberto Fernández, left the Lima Group in March 2021 on the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice, criticizing the participation of Juan Guaidó in the bloc. In 2021, President Pedro Castillo of host Peru promised to "deactivate" the group, and his government announced Peru would leave the Lima Group in August. However, after the resignation of foreign affairs minister Héctor Béjar and the appointment of Óscar Maúrtua, who has expressed support for the group, political analysts expect a backtrack of the withdrawal decision. On 9 August Saint Lucia announced preparing to exit the group, a decision confirmed the following day.
After left wing parties took power in Mexico and Bolivia, both countries begun to distance themselves from the group, criticizing their interventionist nature. Until 2021 Bolivia had not officially left the group, despite as they recognize Nicolas Maduro as the legitimate president of Venezuela.

Aulus Gabinius Secundus (consul 35)

Aulus Gabinius Secundus was a Roman senator and general who was active during the reign of Tiberius. He was suffect consul for the second half of the year 35 as the colleague of Decimus Valerius Asiaticus. 
Following his consulate, Secundus was appointed "legatus" or commander of the army in Germania Inferior. In 41, Secundus led a successful campaign against the Germanic tribe of the Chauci, who had settled on the North Sea coast between the Elbe and Ems rivers. These Germans had made themselves unpopular with the Romans by their raids and their connection with the neighbouring Frisii. The Chauci had also fought on the side of Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in the year 9, in which the Germans destroyed three Roman legions, a vicious defeat the Romans remembered well. Secundus gained much prestige by recovering the last of the three battle eagles that had been lost in the battle. For this achievement, and Sulpicius Galba's victory against the Chatti that same year, the emperor Claudius took the title imperator. Gabinius was awarded the right to use the surname "Chaucius".
Despite Secundus' victory, however, the Chauci did not submit. Within six years, they resumed their raids and with their light pirate ships plundered the Gallic coast. 
The homonymous consul of the year 43 is likely his son.

Mathilde Emma Halse (born May 2, 1999) is a Danish curler from Gentofte. She competed in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Currently she is the skip of the Danish National Women's Curling Team.
Career.
Halse became the skip of the Danish National Junior Women's Curling Team in 2019 where she skipped the team at the 2019 World Junior-B Curling Championships (January). They lost in the quarterfinals and would not qualify for the World Juniors. She became the skip of the National Women's Team later that year and represented Denmark at the 2019 European Curling Championships where they went 2–7. This qualified them for the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship, which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the 2019 World Junior-B Curling Championships (December), the team was successful in qualifying for the 2020 World Junior Curling Championships in Krasnoyarsk, Russia where they went 4–5.
Halse competed at the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship as third for the Danish team skipped by Madeleine Dupont. The event was played in a bio-secure "bubble" to prevent spread of the virus. There, the Danish team qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 2011, finishing the round robin with an 8–5 record.

De Post van den Neder-Rhijn

De Post van den Neder-Rhijn ("The Post of the Nether Rhine") was a Patriot magazine from 1781 to 1787, at the end of the Dutch Republic. It was one of the first opinion weeklies in the Netherlands, and was edited by Pieter 't Hoen (1744–1828).
Through the first publication of "De Post van den Neder-Rhijn" in January 1781 the periodical political opinion press was born in the Netherlands.
After the Prussian invasion of Holland in September 1787 and the following Orange Restoration, the paper initially tried to placate the stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange by welcoming his return, but shortly thereafter the publication was discontinued, and 't Hoen fled abroad (probably France or the Southern Netherlands). In March 1795, after Revolutionary France's successful Flanders campaign and the proclamation of the Batavian Republic, he returned and resumed the publication of what was now called "De nieuwe post van den Neder-Rhyn" ("The New Post of the Nether Rhine") until December 1799. A separate editorial staff without 't Hoen published a few more issues in 1797 en 1798 using the magazine's old title.

Tsaigumi

The Tsaigumi UAV is an unmanned aerial vehicle designed and used by the Nigerian Air Force. It is one of the first UAVs indigenously developed in Nigeria.
This is in furtherance of the ongoing drive to produce and incorporate made-in-Nigeria military weapons.
History.
Former President Goodluck Jonathan claimed that the Tsaigumi is actually the same as the GULMA drone developed by Nigeria in 2013, and hence not the first domestic Nigerian UAV. Air Vice Marshall Olatokunbo Adesanya disputed this, claiming that the GULMA drone "was not operational", and that the Tsaigumi was thus the first completed Nigerian UAV.
Operations.
Air Vice Marshal Olatokunbo Adesanya stated that the Tsaigumi would be used for operations including disaster monitor, law enforcement, weather forecasting, protecting wildlife, and monitoring Nigeria's exclusive economic zone.
Design.
The Tsaigumi UAV's airframe was built by the 431 Engineering Group of the Nigerian Air Force, with the avionics and telemetry equipment were developed by UAVision of Portugal. The designer was reported to be Nkemdilim Anulika Ofodile, an aerospace engineer in the Nigerian Air Force.
Tsaigumi means 'surveillance' in the local Hausa language. It is a twin-boom UAV spotting a pusher propeller configuration. It is fitted with an Electro-Optical Forward Looking Infra-red System (EO FLIR).
For take-off and landing, the Tsaigumi UAV is fitted with a tri-cycle landing gears which has two main wheels and a steerable front wheel attached to the nose of the vehicle.
Its maximum take-off weight is 95 kg.

Lavina, Rezzo

Lavina is a "frazione" (and parish) of the municipality of Rezzo, in Liguria, northern Italy. Up to 1928 it was a self-standing comune.
Geography.
The village of Lavina is located close to the Giara di Rezzo, mostly on its right banks, while the hamlet of "Borghetto" is on the opposite side of the creek. The former comune of Lavina also encompassed woodland and meadows on the surrounding mountain slopes, thus permitting some cattle breeding.
The area of Lavina is prone to landslides, which caused heavy damages both in the past and in recent years.
History.
A first document referring to Lavina is of 1320 and mentions the parish church of "Sant'Antonio Abate". The "Statuti di Lavina" ("Statutes of Lavina") were written in 1357, when the village was part of the Maro feud. Those statutes regulated several mattere like the use of pastures and waters, municipal and judicial offices and several aspects of property transferts. In 1455 Lavina was given by the House of Ventimiglia to the Lascaris, along with the rest of the valley, and so it passe under the control of the "Contea di Tenda" ("Tende's county"). Generally speaking Lavina followed the fate of Rezzo and of its valley, which was later absorbed by casa Savoia. The village was originally located in a place high on the river but it was destroyed by a landslide and had to be reconstructed in the present-day location. Between the 18th and 19th century, during the period defined by some historians as the "French Regime", the comune of Lavina was united with the neighbouring comune of Cenova. Both the villages obtained their autonomy at the end of the First French Empire and maintained it until 1928. In that year they were both absorbed by the comune of Rezzo, so that the whole Giara valley was unified from the administrative point of view.
Culture.
Three architects who worked in Liguria and Piedmont between the 16th and 17th centuries were born in Lavina:

2018 Copa América de Beach Soccer

The 2018 Copa América de Beach Soccer (known natively in Spanish as the "Copa América de Futbol Playa") was the second edition of the "Copa América de Beach Soccer", an international beach soccer competition in South America, contested between the men's national teams of the members of CONMEBOL.
The competition was organised by South American football's governing body, CONMEBOL; other beach soccer events under the "Copa América" title took place during 1994–99, 2003 and 2012–14, however this incarnation is the first to be officially organised and sanctioned by CONMEBOL.
The tournament was hosted by Peru in the Asia District, around 100 km south of the capital, Lima, between 3 and 10 March. The event was held in cooperation with the local organisers, the Peruvian Football Federation (FPF).
The matches were watched by over 3.5 million people through the FPF's use of Facebook Live to transmit the games worldwide, to the delight of CONMEBOL who claimed the figures demonstrated beach soccer's continued growth under its investment.
Brazil were the defending champions and successfully reclaimed the title, beating Paraguay in the final in what was a repeat of the concluding match in the last edition.
Teams.
Teams representing all 10 members of CONMEBOL took part.
Venue.
One venue was used in the Asia District, Cañete Province.
Squads.
Each team had to submit a squad of 12 players, including a minimum of two goalkeepers (Regulations Article 4.1).
Draw.
The draw to split the ten teams into two groups of five took place on February 15 in the Asia District of Peru at the "Centro Deportivo del Boulevard Asia," (Sports Centre of Boulevard Asia).
The teams were seeded based on their final ranking in the previous edition of the Copa América de Beach Soccer in 2016.
Initially, two teams were automatically assigned to the groups:
The remaining eight teams were split into four pots of two based on their seeding, in order from the highest seeds placed in Pot 1, down to the lowest seeds placed in Pot 4. From each pot, one team was drawn into Group A and the other team was drawn into Group B.
Group stage.
The top two teams of each group advanced to the semi finals. The teams finishing in third through fifth proceeded to play in consolation matches against the teams finishing in the same position in the other group to determine their final rank.
Each team earns three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows (Regulations Article 6.2):
If two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above criterion, their rankings are determined as follows:

Sagephora phortegella is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1888. This species is endemic to New Zealand.
The wingspan is 8–13 mm. The forewings are ochreous-white, the dorsal half suffusedly streaked with whitish-ochreous. There is a thick, gradually-dilated, blackish streak along the costa from base to three-fourths, the apex pointed, the lower margin with a slight projection before the middle. There is sometimes an irregular blackish line below the middle from near the base parallel to the inner and hind-margins to the apex, and a similar almost marginal line along the inner margin to the anal angle, then as a hindmarginal streak to the apex, where it is confluent with the first. Sometimes, there is a defined narrow blackish streak along the inner margin, and a moderate blackish hindmarginal fascia attenuated at the extremities. The hindwings are grey or whitish-grey, rarely rather dark grey.

Frederic Apcar

Frederic Apcar (born Frédéric Stefan Apcar; September 16, 1914 – August 2, 2008) was a Russian-born French acrobatic dancer and producer/impresario best known for his pioneering "Vive Les Girls" and long-running "Casino de Paris" shows at the Dunes. These Parisian-inspired productions offered a colorful variety of acts featuring singers, dancers, magicians, comedians, acrobats, animal trainers and more.
Biography.
Frederic Apcar was born September 16, 1914 in the French Embassy in Russia (today known as Tiflis, Georgia) of Parisian parents and later raised in Paris, France. Apcar first took interest in theater performance after watching the well-known opera, "Le Spectre de la Rose!" at the young age of 10. Between the ages of 12 and 16, Apcar tried his hand at several professions, working as a market laborer, coal stoker, bookkeeper, printer's devil, waiter and dock boy. Displeased with his last position, he turned his interest back to theater. 
After working briefly as an usher in the Rex Theater in Paris, Apcar then went on to study classical, modern, and tap dancing. At the age of 16, Apcar became a professional dancer, performing first as a chorus boy at the Folies Bergère. Apcar quickly became principal dancer in Folies Bergère after demonstrating his talent and formed his own act, "Florence and Frederic", just four years later. Together at Bal Tabarin (Paris), Florence Waren and Frederic Apcar became one of the most renowned ballroom dance teams in Europe, occasionally performing with Édith Piaf and Maurice Chevalier. In 1955, the adagio act expanded to a 14-member ensemble known as The Florence and Frederic Ballet, later making its American debut on Ed Sullivan's variety show. In 1959, producer Lou Walters brought Apcar and his troupe to the Tropicana to join the U.S. Edition of the Folies Bergère.
A fan of his work, Dunes owner Major Riddle tested Apcar's production abilities before offering him the Dunes' main showroom. It was in 1961 when Apcar conceived and produced in entirety, his very first musical revue, "Vive Les Girls." After proving wild success with it, Apcar launched "Casino de Paris" in December 1963, in a brand new theater built by Dunes management expressly for the new French spectacular. "Casino de Paris" ran for two decades at Dunes hotel, headlined by legendary French singer Line Renaud
Beyond "Vive Les Girls!" and "Casino de Paris," Apcar went on to produce other hit shows in Las Vegas, including “Bare Touch of Las Vegas,” “Hot Streak,” “Showbiz” and many more. Apcar continued to conceive, produce and direct shows throughout the United States until his retirement in 1993. He maintained Las Vegas as his home base until his death. In 2006, Apcar received a lifetime achievement award from the Nevada Entertainer/Artist Hall of Fame at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Apcar died on August 2, 2008 at the age of 93.
Frederic Apcar is survived by his wife Olga, daughter Elisabeth, and son Frederic Apcar II, who carries his father's legacy producing shows in Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada.

Ocean Elders is a worldwide group of activists dedicated to protecting the ocean, wildlife, and nature itself. The group promotes the expansion of existing marine protected areas and the creation of new ones. The group maintains that this will allow marine ecosystems to recover from the effects caused by human activities. The group includes scientists, musicians, business leaders, royalty, and country leaders.
History.
The group was formed in 2011 by Gigi Brisson.
Recent activity.
In 2016, members of the group visited Cuba as part of a delegation to meet leaders from government, academia and civil society. The goal of the visit was to learn about the measures that have been taken to protect the local marine ecosystems.
In 2017, Ocean Elders wrote to Malcolm Turnbull (then Prime Minister of Australia) with petition to reject the Carmichael coal mine, proposed by Adani Group. The activists argued that the coal mine would have a devastating impact on the Great Barrier Reef.

<doc id="56598639" url="?curid=56598639" title="Innate immune defect">
Innate immune defect

An innate immune defect is a defect in the innate immune response that blunts the response to infection. These defects may occur in monocytes, neutrophils, natural killer cells, basophils, mast cells or complement proteins.
Types.
Toll-like Receptor (TLR) immunodeficiencies.
Several TLR immunodeficiencies have been described in which cellular proteins that should transmit the message from the TLRs to the nucleus are abnormal. These signaling defects result in a failure of cytokines to be produced in response to bacterial infection. Disorders of this type include MyD88 deficiency, IRAK-4 deficiency other UNC93B deficiency and TLR3 mutations.
MyD88 deficiency.
Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 deficiency (MyD88) is a disorder of the innate immune system. It belongs to rare primary immunodeficiency characterized by an increased susceptibility to certain types of bacterial infections. Patients suffer from abnormally frequent and severe infections by a subset of bacteria known as pyogenic bacteria such as "Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae" and "Pseudomonas aeruginosa". However, affected individuals have normal resistance to other common bacteria, virusesfungi, and parasites. MYD88 deficiency is caused by mutations in the MYD88 gene and is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. MYD88 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in stimulating the immune system to respond to bacterial infection. The MyD88 protein is part of a signaling pathway that is involved in early recognition of pathogens and the initiation of inflammation to fight infection. This signaling pathway is part of the innate immune response. Most people with this condition have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood. Infections become less frequent by about age 10.
IRAK4 deficiency.
Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase deficiency is an inherited disorder of the immune system. This immunodeficiency leads to recurrent infections caused by the pyogenic bacteria, for example "Streptococcus pneumoniae", "Staphylococcus aureus" and "Pseudomonas aeruginosa", but not by other infectious agents. Most patients with IRAK-4 deficiency suffer from invasive bacterial infections, which can cause sepsis, meningitis or they affect the joints that can lead to inflammation and arthritis. These invasive infections can also cause areas of tissue breakdown and pus production (abscesses) on internal organs. In addition, patients are characterized by infections of the upper respiratory tract, eyes or skin. Although fever is a common reaction to bacterial infections, many people with IRAK-4 deficiency do not at first develop a high fever in response to these infections, even if the infection is severe. Most patients have their first bacterial infection before age 2, and the infections can be life-threatening in infancy and childhood. Infections become less frequent with age.
UNC93B and TLR3 deficiency.
UNC93B1 is very important signaling molecule involved in the production of interferon which plays a key role in the killing of viruses. Signaling through TLRs 3, 7, 8, and 9 normally induces production of interferons that are binding to viral RNA and destroy the virus. Deficiency of UNC93B1 or TLR3 leads for example to susceptibility to encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV-1) due to decreased production of interferons in the central nervous system.
Defects in IFN-γ/IL-12 signaling.
Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)/interleukin-12 (IL-12) pathway deficiencies belongs to rare innate immune defects. They are characterized by susceptibility to salmonella infections and also mycobacteria. Mycobacteria is the family of bacteria which cause tuberculosis and other related infections. This deficiency usually occurs in children's after tuberculosis vaccination. The other typical symptoms may be different skin infections, swollen lymph nodes or blood stream infections with an enlarged liver and spleen.
Diagnosis.
Patients with innate immune defects have generally intact adaptive immune systems with normal antibodies and T-cells. The main symptom is increased level of eosinophils in the blood, but elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels may also be present. The diagnosis is made in suspected patients by measuring cytokine production by white blood cells, after stimulation by bacterial products. Testing of TLR function is becoming available through commercial reference laboratories. By abnormal tests is usually made repeat testing and also genetic testing.
Treatment.
The common treatment for these defects usually involves antibiotic therapy to treat acute infections. Prophylactic antibiotic therapy is also used. Some patients require immunoglobulin treatment.

Marcello Ferrada de Noli

Marcello Ferrada de Noli (born 25 July 1943) is a Swedish professor emeritus of epidemiology, and "medicine doktor" in psychiatry (Ph.D. Karolinska Institute, Sweden). He was Research Fellow and lecturer at Harvard Medical School, and was later head of the research group of International and Cross-Cultural Injury Epidemiology at the Karolinska Institute until 2009. Ferrada de Noli is known for his investigations on suicidal behaviour associated with severe trauma. He is the founder of the NGO Swedish Doctors for Human Rights, SWEDHR.
Academic career.
"Studies": in Philosophy, Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaiso, 1962. University of Concepción, 1962–1968. degree, University of Chile, 1969. Licentiate in Medical Sciences (psychiatry), 1994, and PhD in psychiatry in 1996, Karolinska Institute, Sweden. Postdoctoral in Social Medicine, Harvard Medical School, 1997–1998.
Ferrada de Noli was full Professor of Psychology at the University of Chile, Arica, 1970. Invited Professor at Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León, México, 1972. At the time of the 1973 Chilean coup d'état he was full Professor of Psychosocial Methods at the University of Concepción.
Ferrada de Noli held various research positions at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, from assistant researcher at the Social and Forensic Psychiatry Department (1987) to Senior Research Scientist at the Department of Clinical Neuroscience, Psychiatry Section (1997). Professor of Health Psychology, University of Tromsø, Norway 1997. He qualified as a full Professor of Health promotion, and as a Professor of Cross-cultural psychology, at the University of Bergen, Norway, 1999, and was thereafter Invited Professor of Cross-Cultural Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Norway, 2000. In Sweden he was Full Professor of Public-Health Epidemiology at the University of Gävle, position shared at Karolinska Institute, Department of Social Medicine 2002–2007. Invited Professor of International Health, University of Gävle, 2007. Professor Emeritus (title), 2007. He was appointed Affiliate Professor at the Medical Faculty, University of Chile, 2006.
His scholarly work has been cited in about 800 scientific articles and books, In the journal "Clinical Psychology Review" (2009), three authors wrote that Ferrada de Noli and co-workers had found a new pathway in the pathogenesis of suicidal behaviour associated with PTSD. The review concluded that Ferrada de Noli and his co-workers "demonstrated that among refugees with PTSD, major depression was not substantially associated with heightened levels of suicidal behaviour". Meaning that the path to severe suicide attempts in PTSD victims was not mediated by depression - as it was thought before - but linked directly to PTSD. The discovery indicated modifications in prevention and treatment of suicidal behaviour. Another finding was significant correlations between specific methods in suicidal behavior and methods used in torture inflicted to prisoners later diagnosed with PTSD. In the book "Suicide and the Holocaust" Professor David Lester referred to that finding, and summarized: "for example those subjected to water torture thought of using drowning". He established ethnicity as significant risk factor for suicidal deaths in Sweden, and found statistically significant markers associating Socioeconomic Status (SES) and suicidal behaviour in Sweden. From 2004 to 2007 and 2007-2012 he was appointed by the Swedish government alternate scientific member of the Swedish Central Ethical Review Board for research.
Political activism.
The Swedish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter" (2008) described Ferrada de Noli as "left-liberal", and newspaper (2013) writes, "Left-liberal. But his conservative past continued to chase him". In newspaper Expressen (2018) Ferrada de Noli declared he participated as "social-libertarian" in the foundation of the guerrilla organization MIR in 1965, besides having been briefly active in the Swedish Liberal Party during the 1980s – which at the time had a social-liberal profile in Swedish politics.
In an op-ed in "Dagens Nyheter" (2015) de Noli advocated for Sweden to return being a neutral country "as it was in Olof Palme's times", and "resuming an active role in the work for peace and respect for human rights in the world". Ferrada de Noli has been referred to as one of the founders of the Revolutionary Left Movement (Chile), MIR (1965), and co-author of the "Political-Military Thesis" approved in the foundation congress. MIR was a far left guerrilla organization with roots in the Socialist Party of Chile, where he had participated in the regional board of its youth organization in Concepción. MIR was considered Pinochet regime's "number one counterinsurgency target". 
 He was detained several times by the government authorities, and was among the 13 leaders of MIR listed in the national arrest warrant issued by the Chilean authorities prosecuting MIR's subversion activities in 1969. He was finally captured and held incommunicado in Concepción's Prison.
After the aborted MIR resistance to the military in Concepción ensuing the 1973 Chilean coup d'état, Ferrada de Noli was captured and held prisoner in Quiriquina Island. In a photo of the epoch in newspaper "La Tercera", he appeared among prisoners described as "extremists that have attacked the military forces with fire weapons".
In 1974 he went to Italy to participate as a witness at the Russell Tribunal in Rome, which reviewed human rights transgressions by the Government Junta of Chile.
In Sweden, he continued in MIR until 1977 as head of MIR and Junta Coordinadora Revolucionaria counter-intelligence activity in Scandinavia, undertaking aimed the monitoring of Operation Condor. In 1976 he started working as psychotherapist at health services for political refugees in Stockholm County, and 1989 in crisis therapy provided at the Swedish Red Cross Project for traumatized and torture-survivor refugees. During mid-80s he participated in the Swedish Liberal Party.
Following retirement, Ferrada de Noli founded the online magazine "The Indicter" , dealing with "human rights and geopolitical issues", as read in the magazine's banner.
Controversies.
Early controversies.
Earlier academic controversies have involved articles in Swedish medical journals and media on his public opposition to the Swedish diagnose "utbrändhet" (work-related stress 'burnout'), which he said didn't have epidemiological ground. After he wrote in DN that one risk factor for "utbrändhet" in women could be stress caused by a double working load, at the job and then at home –contradicting the notion of an advanced Swedish gender equality, Minister Mona Sahlin commented that his thesis was "a bid insulting, to say the least". Later in 2005, "Aftonbladet" published a half front-page headline, "Professor in attack against the burned-out". It referred an interview where Ferrada de Noli stated that to be displeased with a job cannot be equated with a medical diagnosis, and a new debate ensued in the Swedish media.
In 1998, at that time professor in Norway, De Noli requested the legal extradition of General Augusto Pinochet, to be judged in a European court on allegations of torture and war crimes.
Assange case.
De Noli has been criticized in the Swedish media for his public defence of Julian Assange. He published the book "Sweden vs. Assange. Human Rights Issues", claiming that the case was instead political. In 2011, via Jennifer Robinson, he submitted to the London Court deliberating the extradition of Assange, a testimony based on his investigation "Swedish Trial by Media". In 2012, Swedish Radio said in a broadcast that Ferrada de Noli has implicated "a social democratic feminist working together with 'arms-(exports) companies' trying to get Assange". Ferrada Noli denied that and asked Swedish Radio for a retraction.
In a reportage about Ferrada de Noli's human rights undertakings done by the Italian newspaper "L'Eco di Bergamo" (January 2019), he was asked why he defended Assange's deeds "instead of regard it illegal or criminal". De Noli replied, "According to International Law, what could instead be considered as criminal is what Assange has denounced", In 2019, he published his second book on the case, "Sweden's Geopolitical Case Against Assange 2010-2019".
Questioning of reported evidence on the alleged gas attacks in Khan Shaykhun.
In 2017, Ferrada de Noli elicited international controversy over his publications and statements questioning the evidence around allegations of gas attacks in Syria by government forces. In December 2017, the Russian permanent representative to the UN submitted to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) an article by him in his magazine "The Indicter", in which he alleged epidemiological bias in the report issued by the OPCW-UN Joint Investigative Mechanism on the Khan Shaykhun chemical attack of April 2017 in Syria. SWEDHR publications in "The Indicter" authored by de Noli have been cited or included in documents submitted at the UNSC by the Russian and Syrian ambassadors, added the Russian envoys at the OPCW or the ambassador to the UK.
European mainstream media, e.g. "Le Figaro", ARD/BR, and Der Spiegel, raised criticism of his geopolitical articles published by SWEDHR and in "The Indicter". "Dagens Nyheter", together with other Swedish newspapers, e.g. Aftonbladet Expressen, Göteborgs-Posten, Västerbottens-Kuriren, Uppsala Nya Tidning, also addressed Ferrada de Noli's "frequent interviews in Russian media and Russian-government international propaganda channels", and questioned the mentions of his work and his organization SWEDHR at press briefings of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation. Ferrada de Noli contested the media criticism in the journal of the Swedish Medical Association Läkartidningen, claiming that SWEDHR is "absolutely independent". In an interview on the subject, he declared, "We only have our own line. Whether that coincide or not with the positions of different countries, that is not our intention".
Geneva Press Club.
The Geneva Press Club ("Club Suisse de la Presse") organized a conference in November 2017 to debate events in Syria. Reporters Without Borders (RWB) called for its cancellation, arguing against an invitation to Ferrada de Noli to hold a keynote address, being "president of an organization that, according with our information, acts as a tool of Russian propaganda." De Noli called RWB on Twitter to "publish your evidence now, or shame". Guy Mettan, president of the Geneva Press Club, dismissed the attacks as "not worth of journalism". The conference ultimately took place with police protection due to reported threats. Earlier that year the Russian TV network Rossiya-24 had also reported on alleged threats to Ferrada de Noli, to which he commented in the interview, "SWEDHR is not afraid and will continue its work".
Skripal case.
At early events around the Skripal poison incident in Salisbury, de Noli was subject of new criticism in Danish TV and Swedish media (e.g. Danish newspaper "Dagens Nyheter"). De Noli's thesis was that the poison Novichok would have been developed in Uzbekistan, not in Russia, and its possession by other countries could not be ruled out. According to "Dagens Nyheter", he would have declared in an interview done with him by the newspaper April 2, 2018, that the Skripal incident could be a case of False flag in anticipating an eventual confrontation sought by the United Kingdom against Russia.
Family.
Marcello Ferrada de Noli was born in Copiapó, Chile, in family of Italian origin, descendants to the nobleman and navigator Antonio de Noli. His father was a company owner and retired officer in the armed forces, and his mother was a professor at the University of Concepción. He is the father of Swedish authors and , and lives in Bergamo, Italy.

Rudolph M. Hunter

Rudolph Melville Hunter (June 20, 1856 – March 19, 1935) was an American inventor, engineer, patent attorney and entrepreneur. Hunter was granted 299 US patents, over 140 of them for electric railway apparatus. He played a key role in the development of "mixed control," long the standard method of controlling the speed of electric streetcars and locomotives. Hunter later largely abandoned his work as a practical inventor and devoted himself to a futile (despite his claims of success) quest to transmute silver and other metals into gold.
Early life and education.
Hunter's father, Robert, was a physician specializing in respiratory disorders. Canadian by birth, he married Sarah Barton, also Canadian, in 1846. Rudolph was born in New York City, the fifth of the couple's eight children who survived infancy.
Robert Hunter, an inventor in his own right, was granted seven US patents for marine propulsion systems (including one for a mechanical toy fish). The last of those patents (No. 150,956), issued in May 1874, was for an innovative design that he had introduced in a canal boat in 1872. Lured by a $100,000 prize, he entered the boat in a New York State-sponsored contest to design a viable steam propulsion system for use on the state's canals. Hunter's design featured two stern-mounted, vertically oriented paddlewheels that rotated in opposite directions, in order to control wake. The pitch of the wheels' blades could be adjusted to steer the boat without the use of a rudder or to move it in reverse without reversing the engine. Unfortunately, the system proved impracticable, and the boat failed to complete its trial runs.
From childhood Rudolph was strongly encouraged to invent, and one of his early inventions appears to have been inspired by his father's canal-boat work. In 1878, at age 22, he sketched a rudderless submarine equipped with two side-mounted screw propellers. The propellers could be pivoted to point backward, forward, up or down, thereby moving the vessel in any direction. He refined the design and in the 1880s tried to sell it to the US Navy and foreign governments. He failed to find a buyer, however, and he did not patent the design.
Hunter attended schools in England, France and Canada before embarking, at age 15, on his career path. In 1871 he started work as a draftsman for Frank Millward, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Millward did engineering and patent work, and Hunter, while in his employ, diligently studied engineering. In 1874 Hunter took his newfound engineering skills to Olive Foundry &amp; Machine Shops, in Ironton, Ohio, where he designed and built machinery. By 1876 he had moved to Chicago, Illinois, in part to seek proper care (most likely from his father, who had moved there from Cincinnati) for respiratory troubles. Later that year he moved to Philadelphia, where he resumed his formal education. He studied mechanical engineering at the Polytechnic College of the State of Pennsylvania, earning a bachelor's degree in 1878. He settled permanently in Philadelphia and in October 1879 married Emilie Phillips, daughter of a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, physician.
Career.
By late 1878 Hunter had established an office in Philadelphia to offer his services as a consulting engineer and patent attorney. In June 1879 he secured his first patent (No. 216,519), for a "process and apparatus" for making illuminating gas. He eventually held 299 US patents, 279 of them issued by 1902. He also secured seven Canadian and six British patents, all for inventions on which he also held a US patent. His inventions ranged from mechanical toys to industrial machinery, but most were for electrical devices and systems. Throughout his career as an inventor, he continued to work as a patent attorney, representing himself in numerous patent interference cases, in addition to serving outside clients.
Electric railways.
Hunter's primary focus, early in his career, was on the development of electric railways. From 1881 to 1886 he struggled to secure financing to patent and commercialize his many inventions in the field. But with the formation of Electric Car Company of America (originally named Hunter Electric Co.), in 1887, he finally had the resources to build and market electric street-railway systems. Electric Car's prospects quickly dimmed, however, largely due to the success of other inventors and to the efforts of major electrical firms to develop their own street-railway businesses. In 1888 Frank J. Sprague completed the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, widely considered the first successful large-scale electric street-railway system. Sprague had close ties to Thomas Edison's organization, and in April 1889 his company became part of the newly incorporated Edison General Electric Co. Over a year earlier, Thomson-Houston Electric Co. had bought out Sprague's chief rival, Charles Van Depoele, and in August 1889 Thomson-Houston bought partial rights to Electric Car's patents, the bulk of which were Hunter's.
Edison General and Thomson-Houston were locked in fierce competition, one aspect of which was costly and time-consuming patent litigation. By early 1892 both companies were eager to end the rivalry, and in April they did so, by merging. One of the merger's key benefits was to consolidate control of the Sprague, Van Depoele, and Electric Car patents (and many other patents) in the resulting corporate giant, General Electric Co.
The sale of Electric Car's patent rights, though it may have dashed any grand hopes Hunter had for the company, made him a wealthy man. In a December 1894 letter to Franklin Institute secretary William H. Wahl, Hunter intimated that the deal had netted him more than $600,000 (more than $15,000,000 in 2018 dollars). That figure is unverified and may be exaggerated, but there is little doubt that Thomson-Houston considered his patents valuable. In an 1891 publication, the company listed the 82 "most important" electric railway patents under its control. A surprising 27 of them, more than for any other inventor, were Hunter's. And it is clear that his financial situation and lifestyle improved dramatically at about the time of the sale. In December 1889, after years of living in rented quarters, he moved into a castle-like mansion he built in West Philadelphia. By 1893 he had crowned the structure with a rooftop street-railway line, which he used, he told "The Philadelphia Press", to test and apply new designs.
In 1894, hoping to gain recognition for his electric railway work, Hunter entered an annual competition conducted by the Franklin Institute's Committee on Science and the Arts. In a June 26 letter to Wahl, he audaciously claimed to have invented the "modern electric railway" virtually in its entirety. On his official entry forms, submitted a few days earlier, he was more realistic, claiming credit mainly for two of the electric street-railway's key elements: the "trolley system" (specifically, a viable underrunning trolley assembly) and the "series-multiple controller" (a speed- and torque-control switch, better known as the "series-parallel controller").
A report on Hunter's entry concluded that other inventors had received at least partial credit for the underrunning trolley and that it was up to "the courts," not the Committee on Science and the Arts, to determine priority of invention. The committee declined, therefore, to give him an award. Hunter was outraged, though the committee's decision clearly was justified. Nearly two years earlier, the US Patent Office had granted priority of invention to Van Depoele, who had prevailed against both Sprague and Hunter in a landmark interference case. Van Depoele's patent (No. 495,443), issued posthumously and assigned to Thomson-Houston, was extremely valuable and, not surprisingly, hotly contested in the courts. In a string of infringement suits brought by Thomson-Houston on GE's behalf, the courts repeatedly affirmed the patent's validity, thereby giving GE a virtual monopoly on the practical underrunning trolley.
The series-parallel controller had also been the subject of an interference battle. Hunter held a US patent (No. 385,055), issued in June 1888, for the device, but a British patent (Great Britain No. 2989 of 1881) had been granted to electrical engineer John Hopkinson over six years earlier. Hopkinson applied for a US patent in 1892, triggering an interference case. Hunter presented evidence that he had conceived his controller before Hopkinson's formal (for purposes of the case) date of invention, but Hopkinson nonetheless was granted priority of invention. Hunter, the examiner of interferences explained, had failed to show sufficient diligence in reducing his device to practice, prior to Hopkinson's date of invention. Hopkinson's British patent expired, however, before the case was resolved. That made him ineligible for a US patent (which, if issued, would have expired concurrently with his British patent), and Hunter's patent therefore remained in force.
Hunter's contribution to electric-railway motor control did not consist entirely of the series-parallel controller, however. Before the adoption of series-parallel control, rheostats were widely used to control the speed of cars. In November 1888 Electric Car's general manager, George H. Condict, secured a US patent (No. 393,323) for a switch that improved on Hunter's series-parallel design. His most important advance (though neither he nor Hunter, who acted as his patent attorney, realized it at the time) was to integrate the series-parallel and rheostatic methods in a single control mechanism. Condict's patent was among the many that Electric Car licensed to Thomson-Houston, and in 1892 (just after the Thomson-Houston—Edison General Electric merger was consummated) GE introduced a controller based largely on his design. The new device was extremely successful and, as a result, closely imitated by other companies. Thomson-Houston (on behalf of GE) and Electric Car countered with at least four suits for infringement of Condict's patent. The courts fully upheld the patent at first, but a US circuit court, in a 1901 ruling, partially invalidated it. The court found that "mixed control" (the joint use of series-parallel and rheostatic control) had been anticipated in two Hunter patents (Nos. 431,720 and 385,180). Those patents describe the use of both control methods, but not by way of a single control mechanism. The court therefore recognized the contributions of both Hunter and Condict to mixed control: Hunter for the broad method; Condict for the method’s practical implementation, using a single switch.
Electric power transmission.
Hunter again entered the Franklin Institute competition, In 1896, claiming nothing less than to have invented the " 'step up and step down' transformer system of electrical distribution." He based that claim largely on patent No. 460,071, issued to him in 1891, and on drawings indicating that he had conceived such a system by 1881 and reduced a system to practice by 1884.
The Committee on Science and the Arts, in its report on Hunter's entry, noted that, as early as 1838, Joseph Henry had used transformers to step a current up to higher voltage and back down to lower voltage. Hunter had not, therefore, been first to conceive the broad method. Nor, the report added, had he been first to demonstrate the method's practical utility. Marcel Deprez and Jules Carpentier, in a French patent application dated March 1881, had described the use of a step-up and step-down system to remotely activate a platinum filament. Hunter's claimed conception date was August 1881, several months after Deprez and Carpentier had filed their application. The committee again, therefore, denied him an award.
Electric automobiles.
In 1898 prospects for the electric automobile seemed bright, and Hunter, armed with his electric-railway expertise, joined forces with prominent Philadelphia businessmen to launch General Electric Automobile Co. The new company (which was not affiliated with GE) touted its control of 69 patents, over half of them Hunter's, that it claimed to cover virtually every element of value in battery-powered vehicles. But they were more properly electric railway patents, the rights to which Electric Car had transferred to GE Auto. Their value, for purposes of making automobiles, was therefore at least somewhat open to question.
GE Auto produced passenger and commercial vehicles but apparently had little success selling them. In an April 1900 ad in "The New York Times", John Wanamaker &amp; Co. offered two passenger models for sale. But the automaker was by then in deep financial trouble. A committee had been appointed, in late March, to seek consolidation partners or secure "adequate working capital," and by mid May the company's stock price had collapsed. The committee's efforts, and those of a second reorganization committee, failed, and in July rights to the 69 patents were sold at auction. The $29,000 sale price reportedly covered "less than half" of GE Auto's debt. There is evidence of at least one more reorganization attempt, but the company does not appear to have conducted any significant business after the sale of its patent rights.
Motor Trucks.
In 1901, on the heels of GE Auto's demise, Hunter briefly turned his attention to non-electric vehicles. By the following year he had secured two patents (Nos. 670,405 and 696,143) for motor-trucks powered by gasoline engines (or other means). Both patents were assigned to Tractor Truck &amp; General Power Co., yet another of his enterprises.
The second patent, issued in March 1902, is for a self-contained (i.e., independently operable) truck designed to tow a semi-trailer. Hunter was probably not first to conceive such a vehicle; by 1899 Cleveland, Ohio-based Winton Motor Carriage Co. had converted an automobile into a tractor designed to tow a semi-trailer. But the Winton design was not patented, and Hunter's patent appears to be the first, in the US or elsewhere, for a vehicle that embodies all the basic features of the modern semi-tractor. His key innovation was to position the driver's seat on the tractor, not the trailer (as in previous patents). In so doing, he transformed the tractor from a source of motive power and directional control (essentially, a replacement for the horse) into an independent vehicle.
Transmutation.
In 1903 Hunter largely turned his back on practical invention and turned to a much more speculative pursuit, the transmutation of elements. In a flurry of newspaper articles, the first appearing in July, he announced that he had discovered a process for changing silver (and other metals) into gold. He also announced plans for a $500,000 plant capable of producing "thousands of dollars worth of gold … daily," and he established two firms, Mirabile Corp. and United States Assay and Bullion Co., to implement the venture.
Hunter's claim to have mastered transmutation, though far-fetched, was at least tenuously grounded in advanced (for the day) atomic theory. He had embraced the theory that atoms, instead of being fundamental units of matter (and therefore immutable), consist of yet smaller particles that, depending on their number (and other factors) comprise the different elements. That led him to more or less accurately describe transmutation as a process in which the atom is "divided into its component ions [subatomic particles], and the ions reassembled in new combination." He apparently failed to appreciate, however, how little he (or anyone in 1903) actually knew about the atom and subatomic phenomena. To create gold, he asserted, one needed only to deactivate the particles in silver atoms (by "de-electrifying" them), then "gather up 137,620 of them and impress upon them the proper electric charge … and set them into motion with new orbital range." But that formulation, realistic as it may have seemed to Hunter, was highly speculative and based on faulty assumptions. He had, for example, badly miscalculated the numbers of particles in atoms of silver and gold, and he had assumed all subatomic particles to be the same, except for their electric charge, which he thought could be changed at will.
Just as Hunter was unveiling his transmutation claims, chemists William Ramsay and Frederick Soddy reported one of the most important findings of early atomic science. Their study of radium radioactivity had revealed that radium, as it decays, transmutes into helium. Hunter, in response to that news, wrote Ramsay to tell him that he had already achieved the transmutation of silver into gold. Ramsay, intrigued, wrote Hunter "several times" and in September 1904 visited him in Philadelphia. In letters to his wife and, later, a good friend, Ramsay reported that Hunter was "no swindler" and had "based his conclusions on actual experiments." But his enthusiasm no doubt waned as he observed, for years, samples of processed silver that Hunter had sent him. Hunter claimed that gold was "growing" in the silver, but Ramsay (and others he recruited) found no evidence to support that claim.
Hunter continued to insist, however, that his process worked. In 1916 he went so far as to claim that he could make gold from "common mineral substances, even from water and stone." But the gold-manufacturing plant never materialized, and Mirabile reportedly slipped, more than once, into controversy. There are reports of two 1905 lawsuits (one filed against the company and one on its behalf), both of which state that the transmutation process was invented not by Hunter, but by one of his associates at the company (a different associate was named in each suit). It does not appear, however, that either suit resulted in a judgement or settlement. Some 11 years later, in May 1916, the "Galveston Tribune" reported that Hunter had earlier been obliged to purchase more than $33,000 in Mirabile stock from disenchanted investors, and that his elder son, Rudolph Harding Hunter, was currently trying to seize control of the company. There is no hard evidence, however, that Mirabile (or US Assay and Bullion) intentionally misled or defrauded investors. So it is at least possible that the gold-making venture, no matter how misguided, was legitimate. It is hard to imagine, on the other hand, how someone with Hunter's expertise and experience could have failed to realize that his process did not work, so the possibility of fraud cannot be dismissed.
Later years.
Even as he clung to his transmutation dreams, Hunter never fully abandoned his work as a practical engineer and inventor. He secured 20 US patents after 1902, nine of them for hydraulic equipment: nozzles, valves, and regulators. His last patented invention was a mold for reflective prism-glass; the patent (No. 1,925,096) was issued in September 1933.
Hunter died March 19, 1935, at his home in Philadelphia, having never gained the level of recognition he sought as an inventor, and having never, apparently, renounced his transmutation claims. A stroke, "The New York Times" reported in its obituary, "contributed to his death." His remains lie in Chelten Hills Abbey, a notable (but sadly deteriorating) art-deco mausoleum at Philadelphia’s Chelten Hills Cemetery.

Esther E. Baldwin

Esther E. Baldwin (November 8, 1840 – February 26, 1910), known as "Chinese Champion", was an American missionary, teacher, translator, writer, and editor. She understood the religious and political problems of China, and the Chinese people, as perhaps no other woman in this country did at that time. She labored constantly to bring about a better understanding between the two nations. Baldwin was courageous in her advocacy of whatever appeared to her to be true, by whomsoever it might chance to be condemned or approved. She served as president of the New York Woman's Missionary Society for two decades.
Early years and education.
Esther E. Jerman was born in Marlton, New Jersey, November 8, 1840. Her father, the Rev. Mathias Jerman, was for many years an honored and successful member of the New Jersey Annual Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Esther was constitutionally frail, sensitive and studious.
Her first schooling was given her at home, where was laid the foundation of all her future usefulness. To this was added instruction in the public schools and in an excellent private school in Salem, New Jersey, followed by a full course in Pennington Seminary, New Jersey. She was graduated from that institution in 1859, or 1860, taking the highest honors. Baldwin became a Christian at the age of ten, and united with the church of her parents.
Career.
In 1860, she became a teacher of higher mathematics, Latin and French in a seminary in Virginia. At the beginning of the Civil War her sympathies were with the North, and she resigned her position and returned home.
In the summer of 1861 she met the Rev. Stephen Livingstone Baldwin, of the Foochow Mission, then at home on furlough, and in April, 1862, they were married, and sailed for China the following June, arriving in November, after five months at sea. Besides her domestic responsibilities, she was soon entrusted with the supervision of several day schools and of a class of Bible women who were sent out to read the Bible to their country-women. In her thoughtful survey of the condition of woman and childhood in China, quickened by her personal observation and experience, she became deeply impressed with the need of educated Christian woman physicians. She saw that through this means, access and confidence could be gained and the way opened for missionary work. She was the first to ask for a medical woman to be sent to China. When the hospital for women and children was opened in Foochow, the first for such a purpose founded in that empire, she gave it her cooperation. For several years she translated the Berean Lessons into the Chinese language for the use of the Methodist Mission and of the American Board. For two years, she edited in the same language the "Youth's Illustrated Paper". She saw the missions grow from small beginnings into strong churches.
After eighteen years of this work, she became gravely ill, and her physician declared that a change of climate and entire rest were essential to recovery. The American pulpit was freely open to Dr. Baldwin, and his pastonal services were eagerly sought. For some years, he was the recording secretary of the Board of Missions of the M. E. Church. Baldwin's health was largely restored since her return to the United States, and she spent her time in active benevolence. She was extensively employed in the interests of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, being president for two decades of the New York branch of that society in the Methodist Church, of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, in lectures on various subjects, and in many charities. She was an ardent advocate of the equality of women with men, both in the State and in the Church.
The "Chinese question" in all its aspects had her sympathies. The misrepresentation and abuse of the Chinese kindled her indignation. She was called to speak before large audiences in many places on the "Chinese question" and contributed numerous articles on the subject to various city papers. She carefully collected and forcibly stated both the laws and the facts bearing on the subject, and published them in a volume entitled "Must the Chinese Go?" which had three editions. She won the distinction of being the "Chinese Champion."
Baldwin was one of the ablest debaters of the Methodist Episcopal Church. She spoke at Chautauqua in the early 1880s.
Personal life.
Baldwin was the mother of seven children, six of whom were born in Foochow, and two of whom died there. She died suddenly at the family home in Brooklyn, New York, February 26, 1910.

David Locke Hall

David Locke Hall is a highly decorated former Assistant United States Attorney, Naval Intelligence officer, and author.
Early life.
Hall was born in California in 1955. He received a BA from Dartmouth College, an MBA from Yale, and JD and MA degrees from the University of Pennsylvania. After law school, Hall served as a law clerk to the Honorable Walter King Stapleton, United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
Career.
Assistant United States Attorney.
Hall served for 23 years with the United States Department of Justice as an Assistant United States Attorney, retiring in 2013. He tried a large number of significant cases to verdict, including mobster Roy Stocker of the K&amp;A Gang. Hall also prosecuted the Leath Cocaine Trafficking Organization, the leaders of which were involved in shooting Philadelphia Police Officer Donald McMullin. 
A significant focus of Hall's prosecutorial career was the investigation and prosecution of weapons proliferation and technology transfer offenders. In the 1990s, he prosecuted the Armaments Corporation of South Africa (Armscor), Kentron, Fuchs Electronics, and others for violations of the Arms Export Control Act during the apartheid era. The ARMSCOR case was a significant point of contention between the United States and the Republic of South Africa because ARMSCOR and Kentron were state-owned corporations. After lengthy negotiations, the dispute was resolved by the pleas of ARMSCOR, Kentron, and Fuchs to criminal charges and the payment of fines in excess of $11 million.
From 2004 to 2009, Hall investigated and prosecuted Amir Hossein Ardebili, an Iranian arms procurement agent working in Shiraz, Iran, acquiring components for the F4, F14, and other military aircraft, as well as microchips for use in phased array radar. The years-long investigation resulted in an undercover meeting between Ardebili and U.S. agents on October 1 and October 2, 2007, in Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia, where Ardebili was arrested by Georgian authorities. He was extradited to the United States in January 2008. Ardebili pled guilty to violations of the Arms Export Control Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, smuggling, conspiracy and money laundering in May 2008. The Ardebili case is the subject of a book, Operation Shakespeare: The True Story of an Elite International Sting, written by John Shiffman.
From 2009 to 2013, Hall led the undercover investigation and prosecution of Xiang Li, a Chinese software pirate. Xiang Li's Chengdu, China-based operation sold over $100 million in cracked software products with multiple high-tech applications, including telecommunications, explosive simulation, aerospace, satellite tracking, and flight simulation. The undercover investigation led to a meeting on Saipan between federal agents and Xiang Li in June 2011. At that meeting, Xiang Li delivered 20 gigabytes of proprietary data hacked from a defense contractor. Xiang Li was charged with trafficking in more than $100 million in stolen copyrighted software. He pled guilty in January 2013 and in June 2013 was sentenced to 12 years incarceration.
Hall has testified before the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, Committee on Foreign Affairs, United States House of Representatives on "Examining the Effectiveness of the Kingpin Designation Act in the Western Hemisphere." 
Hall also served as the Special Prosecutor for the FBI Art Crime Team. During this time, he worked closely with FBI Special Agent Robert King Wittman. Hall negotiated the return of three stolen Norman Rockwell paintings from Brazil in 2001. In 2009, he led the successful undercover investigation and prosecution of Marcus Patmon, an art thief who sold stolen works by Picasso. Hall forfeited and returned to Iraq a collection of Mesopotamian artifacts in 2010. In 2011, Hall effected the return to Peru of a gold Moche monkey head (circa 300 A.D.) that had been looted from the royal tombs of Sipan. In 2013, Hall seized and forfeited the Rosenberg Diary, the long-lost diary of Alfred Rosenberg, Nazi propagandist and Reich Minister for the occupied eastern territories. The Rosenberg Diary is now part of the Holocaust Museum collection.
Military Service.
Hall served in the United States Navy and Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer for thirty years. Commissioned in 1984, he retired at the rank of captain in 2015. He commanded three intelligence units and served with the Defense Intelligence Agency, the Office of Naval Intelligence, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in addition to numerous Navy commands. He was a third-generation naval officer, his father having served as a Marine Corps officer with the Second Marine Division in World War II.
Awards and recognitions.
Throughout his career, Hall has received numerous awards in recognition of his outstanding professional and military service including:
2013- ""Meritorious Service Medal" by the United States Navy
2012- "International Achievement Award" by the Department of Homeland Security
2010- "SAFE Beacon Award" by Saving Antiquities for Everyone

He is one of the foremost experts in Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, especially for anxiety disorders Since 2012, he has been editor in chief of the journal Cognitive Therapy and Research
Education.
Hofmann was born on December 15, 1964 in Bietigheim-Bissingen, attended Ellental Gymnasien and studied clinical psychology at the University of Marburg where he received his terminal degree (Dipl.-Psych.) in 1990 and his doctorate (Dr. rer. nat) in 1993 under the mentorship of Anke Ehlers. After a doctoral fellowship funded by the German Academic Exchange Service at Stanford University and post-doctoral work with David H. Barlow, he joined Boston University as a faculty member in 1996.
Scientific contributions.
Clinical Translational Research.
Hofmann has been studying the nature of emotional disorders and the processes through which psychological treatments alleviate suffering by translating discoveries from emotion research and neuroscience into clinical applications.
Pharmacological Augmentation of Psychotherapy.
An important mechanism of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders is extinction learning. Hofmann has shown that d-cycloserine, a partial agonist of the glutamate receptor can augment extinction learning and speed up exposure therapy of anxiety disorders.
Emotion Research.
Some of his other major contributions are on Mindfulness and research on Emotion in therapy. In particular, he advanced the concept of Interpersonal emotion regulation.
Processes-Based Therapy.
In collaboration with Steven C. Hayes, he has been developing Process-based Therapy, an idiographic treatment approach based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that combines insights from evolution theory and complex network theory to target processes that underlie effective psychological treatments.
Neuromarkers of Psychotherapy.
He has been using Magnetic Resonance Imaging to predict the response to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).
Awards and recognition.
Hofmann has published more than 400 peer-reviewed scientific articles and 20 books and is listed by Clarivate Analytics and the Institute for Scientific Information as a ISI Highly Cited Researcher. He was awarded a 2021 Alexander von Humboldt Professorship. Hofmann was president of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies from 2012-2013. He was the recipient of the 2018 Humboldt Prize and the 2015 Aaron T. Beck award for significant and enduring contributions to the field of cognitive therapy. Hofmann became a member of the Academia Europaea in 2018 and was elected to the rank of AAAS Fellow in 2020 "for distinguished contributions to the study and practice of cognitive behavioral therapy, especially for anxiety disorders." He is also a Fellow of the American Psychological Society, and the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies.

Patent Application Information Retrieval (PAIR) is an online service provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to allow users to see the prosecution histories of United States patents and patent applications and obtain copies of documents filed therein. There are two services: Public PAIR, which allows the general public to access information regarding patents and published applications; and Private PAIR, which allows authorized persons to access information regarding applications regardless of publication status.
Displayed tabs.
When a patent application is accessed through PAIR, the following tabs are displayed:
Public PAIR.
Anyone may use Public PAIR to access the prosecution histories of patents and of those applications that have been published. Unpublished applications are unavailable through Public PAIR. To access Public PAIR, one must verify through a reCAPTCHA process that one is not a robot. Non-patent literature cited in a patent application is not available for viewing or downloading through Public PAIR because of concerns over copyright infringement.
Private PAIR.
Users may use Private PAIR to access the prosecution histories of patents, published applications, and those unpublished applications that they are authorized to see. Private PAIR is accessible to registered patent attorneys and agents (and those working under their supervision) who have customer numbers. In 2019, the authentication changed from the use of PKI certificates to the use of two-factor authentication. For an unpublished application, the customer number must match that associated with the requested data.

Angel in the Wings

Angel in the Wings is a musical revue with songs by Bob Hilliard and Carl Sigman and sketches by Hank Ladd, Ted Luce, Paul Hartman, and Grace Hartman.
In addition to contributing sketches, the Hartmans headlined the original Broadway production at the Coronet Theatre (now the Eugene O'Neill Theatre) which ran for 308 performances, from December 11, 1947, to September 4, 1948. The production was considered a surprise hit, with the comic dancing couple Paul and Grace Hartman both receiving the first ever Tony Awards for Best Actor in a Musical and Best Actress in 1948. In her Broadway musical debut, the 22-year-old Elaine Stritch delivered the most notable song of the revue, "Civilization," which went on to become a standard. Although she only had one song in the revue, Stritch was said to have gotten the loudest applause. Also in the cast were Eileen Barton, Eugenie Baird, Nadine Gae, Peter Hamilton, Robert Stanton, Viola Roache, Johnny Barnes, Janet Gaylord, Alan Green, and

Jessamyn Lovell (born 1977 in Syracuse, NY) is a visual artist who primarily uses photography, video, and performance. She has a BFA from Rochester Institute of Technology and an MFA from California College for the Arts. In 2007 Lovell won the first Aperture Portfolio Prize for her work entitled "Catastrophe, Crisis, and Other Family Traditions". However, Lovell is most well known for her work entitled "Dear Erin Hart," in which she found, followed, and photographed her identity thief, Erin Hart. More recently Lovell obtained her private investigator license, as part of her artwork entitled "D.I.Y. P.I." ("Do It Yourself Private Investigator").
Lovell resides in Albuquerque, New Mexico where she teaches at the University of New Mexico and is represented by Central Features Contemporary Art.
Dear Erin Hart,.
For her artwork "Dear Erin Hart," Jessamyn Lovell found, followed, and photographed her identity thief Erin Hart. Lovell's wallet and phone were stolen, but in February 2011, when she was summoned to appear in court for a petty crime for which she was not involved, she learned her identity was also stolen. She tracked down Hart with the help of a private investigator, incorporating the photographs and experience into her art practice. Lovell speaks about not being sure if she wanted to confront Hart and, through the process of making art, begins to empathize with her. She eventually decided to not confront her but did send her a letter including an invitation to the exhibition, to which Hart never responded. The images that resulted reference surveillance photography and ask questions about the ethics of photography in a situation where the subject initially violated the privacy of the photographer.
"Dear Erin Hart," has been exhibited at San Francisco Camerawork, Center for Contemporary Arts Santa Fe, CENTER, Central Features Contemporary Art, Colorado Photographic Arts Center, Carol Calo Gallery, and Sorenson Center for the Arts. A book of the work was published by SF Camerawork in 2015. "Dear Erin Hart," has received international recognition and has been written about by numerous publications including Wired, Hyperallergic, SF Gate, Money Magazine, and many more. "Dear Erin Hart," has also been featured on This American Life.

Mount Carmel West

Mount Carmel West was a primary care hospital located in Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio on a 37-acre campus. Mount Carmel West was the oldest hospital in the Mount Carmel Health System founded in 1886 by the Sisters of the Holy Cross. The hospital was situated between Ohio State Route 16 and U.S. Route 62, and accessible from exits on Interstate 70 and Ohio State Route 315. The Mount Carmel College of Nursing is located on hospital grounds. "U.S. News &amp; World Report" regionally ranked Mount Carmel East and West Hospitals the number 18 best performing among hospitals in Ohio and high performing in four specialties and procedures.
Mount Carmel West was a tertiary hospital with many specialties located on its grounds, but in late 2016 a $46 million plan was announced to transform it into an outpatient facility with a fully functioning emergency department in a new location on the premises. The inpatient services will be moved to a new location under construction in Grove City while the Level II Trauma Center will be moved to the existing Mount Carmel East hospital near Reynoldsburg. The majority of the hospital will be demolished with demolition plans to be completed in 2020. This will see the expansion of the College of Nursing and closure of the inpatient Psychiatry unit with it being moved to a new facility near Mount Carmel East.
History.
What would become Mount Carmel West was first known as Hawkes Hospital of Mt. Carmel, and was founded by Dr. W. B. Hawkes (1812–1883). Before the building was completed, Dr. Hawkes died and was buried in Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. Dr. John W. Hamilton (1823–1898) was tasked to finish construction, and secured the services of the Sisters of the Holy Cross to operate the hospital.
The hospital was formally opened in 1886. The hospital was opened intending to serve the needs of infants and women. In 1906, a second building adjoining the old one containing a chapel and 120 additional patient rooms was started. The Training School for Nurses was opened in 1903 to train nurses including eight sisters in the first graduating class. It has since become the Mount Carmel College of Nursing. It was not until 1921 that an additional 120 patient rooms were added on as well as 20 rooms with recreation halls, three classrooms, and a library to help to the Mount Carmel School of Nursing which is what the nursing school was known as at the time.
From 2014 to 2018, one of the hospital's doctors, William Husel, allegedly overdosed 35 patients at Mount Carmel West and Mount Carmel St. Ann's. Husel is charged with the murder of 25 of them, for prescribing large doses of fentanyl, administered by nurses with no oversight. The hospital fired the doctor, paid $13 million to families in settlements, and the hospital's CEO and chief clinical officer resigned. About 20 employees were fired over the incidents.
In late 2016, a plan was agreed that will begin in 2019 of the transformation of Mount Carmel West from a full inpatient hospital to a facility based on outpatient services while still retaining a full-service emergency department. Mount Carmel Health System plans to begin demolishing the majority of Mount Carmel West hospital by spring 2019 after moving inpatient services will be moved to a new 210-bed hospital being constructed in Grove City. The Emergency department is being rebuilt in a new location. The College of Nursing will also be expanded. All planned work should be finished by 2020.
Mount Carmel College of Nursing.
The Mount Carmel College of Nursing was founded by the Sisters of the Holy Cross in 1903. It has since become one of the largest baccalaureate nursing programs in the state of Ohio. It is still located to this day on the campus of Mount Carmel West. Both freshmen and sophomores are required to live on campus with both coed dorms and single student apartments. Today, it is a private, coeducational and Catholic church affiliated institution with around 1100 full-time students.
It was accredited with the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools (NCA) until that body was dissolved in 2014. It has since maintained accreditation with NCA's successor organization, the Higher Learning Commission. The courses offered on campus include a Bachelor of Science in Nursing, Nursing Administration, Family Nurse Practitioner and Nursing Education, Master of Science in Adult Health, and a Dietetic Internship. During the 100 year anniversary of the College of Nursing it was announced that a Graduate program would be started with a Master of Science degree.
Services.
Mount Carmel West was a tertiary hospital with many specialties including:
Transformation.
In late 2016 a $46 million comprehensive and controversial plan was agreed that will begin in 2019 of the transformation of Mount Carmel West from a full inpatient hospital to a facility based on outpatient services while still retaining a full-service emergency department in a new location on campus. Mount Carmel Health System plans to begin demolishing the majority of Mount Carmel West hospital by spring 2019 with all demolition work to be completed by the end of 2020.
Inpatient services are being moved to a new 210-bed hospital being constructed in Grove City. The Emergency department is being rebuilt in a new location with the Level II Trauma Center being moved to Mt. Carmel East. Plans for how to redevelop the 37-acre campus are still be being finalized while receiving local and community input. The existing plans call for Mount Carmel to keep the four parking garages, some of which directly connect to outpatient offices, and their 2011 parking spaces. The plans call for the equivalent of 1,500 full-time employees will transfer to the Grove City hospital with just 300 staying at Mount Carmel West.
This will also involve the inpatient Psychiatry unit which is being demolished and a new facility to be built on the east side with plans to build a new 80-bed behavioral-health hospital quadrupling the amount of beds at Mount Carmel West.
Investments will also be made to the College of Nursing whose enrollment is expected to grow by 200 to 400 students over the next three to five years from the 1,100 students it currently has enrolled.
Some in the community have welcomed the proposed changes to develop the college of nursing, the possible public park spaces and considerations for affordable housing on the existing hospital grounds. Not everyone in the community have welcomed the possible changes. Some of expressed concern for the amount of full-time staff Mount Carmel will keep in its Mount Carmel West emergency department and about older residents who will soon have to travel longer distances to receive treatment especially in emergencies.
The plan for the West campus is to ensure access to behavioral-health and substance-abuse treatment in Franklinton, and the surrounding area but it was unclear how those services would be provided after the transformation.
Mount Carmel Medical Group.
Mount Carmel West was part of Mount Carmel Medical Group, representing more than 250 primary care and specialty care providers. This is a network of providers for care that is not of an emergency nature. The hospital was also affiliated with Mount Carmel Health Partners – a network of up to "1,200 primary care and specialty physicians" – and with Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield. This expanded the network of care providers in the central Ohio area that were associated with Mount Carmel, although unlike the situation with providers in the Mount Carmel Health System, items such as medical records may not be transferred automatically.
Transport.
The hospital was accessible by public transport via COTA bus services operating throughout metropolitan Columbus, Ohio. Mount Carmel West was also situated between Ohio State Route 16 and U.S. Route 62 and close enough to be seen from Interstate 70 and Ohio State Route 315 allowing for multiple points of access in downtown Columbus. It was also able to be served by a variety of airports in the region supporting medical evacuation flights and an on-site helipad.

Taco trucks at every mosque

Taco Trucks At Every Mosque (also #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque) is a community initiative started in Orange County, California that aims to bring together Muslim and Latino communities through sharing food. The events were the idea of Rida Hamida and Ben Vazquez. The first event took place on June 3, 2017 and have taken place throughout California, in Mexico and Milwaukee.
History.
While Latinos currently make up around a third of Orange County's residents and there are 120,000 Muslims, both minority groups do not have much political power. In 2016, both groups of people saw an increase in documented hate crimes against their communities. Also in 2016, Marco Gutierrez of the "Latinos for Trump" group, said, "You're going to have taco trucks on every corner." When Donald Trump won the presidency, there was an increase in the amount of both anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim feelings in American culture. After Trump won, Rida Hamida, a Muslim from Anaheim, and Benjamin Vazquez, who is a Latino from Santa Ana, met and began a discussion about what Muslims and Latinos could learn from one another. Hamida and Vasquez thought about the taco truck idea and about bringing Muslims to Mexican restaurants. In the end, they decided to bring taco trucks to mosques. Using the taco trucks (or "loncheras") was also a way to empower Latinos. Taco Trucks At Every Mosque is also a way for the two minority communities to get to know one another and combat the fear of immigrant communities.
The first event, an iftar, took place on June 3, 2017 at the Islamic Center of Santa Ana and was attended by 600 people. The halal tacos were given free to people attending the iftar. The second event, a few weeks later at the Islamic Society of Orange County, was attended by 1,400 people. The groups raise money to pay for the tacos and in 2017, visited every mosque in Orange County during Ramadan. Because Ramadan is also a time of charity, the taco truck plan was a good fit. Even though the events focus on the Latino and Muslim communities, everyone is welcome. One person attending the second event hoped that Taco Trucks At Every Mosque would inspire more Muslims to come to Latino events. Hamida and Vazquez promoted the events on Twitter with the hashtag, #TacoTrucksAtEveryMosque.
Legacy.
The Taco Trucks At Every Mosque events have taken place in communities from Baja California in Mexico to Sacramento. They have also taken place during Eid al-Adha. The events have inspired a mosque in Milwaukee, the Islamic Society of Milwaukee, to copy the idea. Marco Gutierrez even posted a video on his Instagram, saying "I tried to warn you people. #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorning has mutated into #TacoTrucksatEveryMosque!"

Kylie Presents Golden

Kylie Presents Golden was a promotional tour by Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue, in support of her fourteenth studio album, "Golden" (2018)"." The tour comprised five shows in Europe and one show in North America.
Background.
In contrast to Minogue's previous tours (with the exception of the Anti Tour), the singer conducted the tour as a short strip of concerts in small venues, performing to reduced crowds and in an intimate setting.
Speaking on the tour, Minogue stated: "I'm so excited to perform songs from my new album "Golden" in these iconic European clubs. Each of these venues is very special and—just as I found making the new album in Nashville to be so energising—these shows will be new, intimate and fun. I just can’t wait to bring these new songs to life and of course, throw in a few surprises for my fans."
In July 2018, Minogue announced an additional thirteen European concerts, which were planned to be a part of the promotional tour. These shows were scheduled to take place in November, consisting of her and her band "sharing the new album" with "a few surprises". However, in late September, Minogue announced that these dates would instead be part of the Golden Tour.
Setlist.
The following setlist was obtained from the concert held on 13 March 2018, at Café de Paris in London, England. It does not represent all shows.

ACF Fiorentina–Juventus F.C. rivalry

The ACF Fiorentina–Juventus F.C. rivalry is an inter-city football rivalry contested between Florence-based Fiorentina and Turin-based Juventus. Unlike most other football derbies, this one is borne not out of geographical proximity (such as the Derby della Madonnina); political differences (El Clásico); or longstanding competitiveness (Liverpool–Manchester United rivalry), but rather is a development from the latter decades of the 20th century based on local patriotism, or "campanilismo", bitterness and accusations of 'thievery'.
The rivalry has been fuelled by their controversial meetings in cup finals, and competition in the transfer market. A player transferring from one club to the other, especially from Florence to Turin, is usually branded a 'traitor' by fans.
Juventus is the most successful team in Italian football, winning 36 league titles, 14 Coppa Italia titles and nine Supercoppa Italiana titles, all national records. Fiorentina, meanwhile, has won two league titles, six Coppa Italia titles, and one Supercoppa Italiana.
Background.
To some extent the rivalry has its origins in the fans of the local teams in Tuscany, as in many other areas of Italy, growing tired of seeing people from their towns heading off to support the country's most successful teams, primarily Juventus. Like many of Europe’s biggest clubs, the "Bianconeri" have attracted followers from far and wide, but the Renaissance town of Florence remained true to Fiorentina. In addition to this and the typical aspect of pride between the residents of two important cities, Juventus had beaten Fiorentina 11–0 in their first league meeting in 1928, a humiliating result which had not been forgotten by either set of fans despite the passage of time. They also contested the 1960 Coppa Italia final, won by "Juve".
1981–82 Serie A title.
In 1980, Fiorentina was bought by Flavio Pontello, a man from a rich house-building family who had aspirations to bring the "Viola" its third title and built the team around Italian star, Giancarlo Antognoni. On the final day of the 1981–82 Serie A season, with both teams competing for the national championship, a series of debatable decisions in two different matches intensified the rivalry. Heading into the last game, both teams were level on 44 points at the top of the table; Fiorentina went to relegation-threatened Cagliari, who needed a point to survive, while Juventus headed to Catanzaro, in seventh position with nothing to play for. Fiorentina had a goal disallowed for a push on the opposing goalkeeper as Cagliari managed to play out a 0–0 draw to steer clear of relegation. In Calabria, Catanzaro were denied a penalty while Juventus were awarded one, from which they scored to win 1–0 and claim their 20th "scudetto" In the aftermath, Fiorentina's playmaker Giancarlo Antognoni famously remarked, 'Ci hanno rubato il titolo', meaning 'They have stolen the title'. The "Viola" tifosi soon coined a saying, 'meglio secondo che ladri', meaning 'better to be second than thieves'.
1989–90 UEFA Cup final.
Juventus won two more championships in the 1980s, while Fiorentina had inconsistent fortunes. In 1985, Fiorentina bought Roberto Baggio, an 18-year-old striker, from Vicenza, for 2.7 billion lire (£1.5 million). Considered one of the leading players of the league, he led Fiorentina to the final of the 1989–90 UEFA Cup, setting up the first all-Italian final in the history of the tournament against their arch-nemesis Juventus. Both sides had had close encounters with German teams in the semi-finals, Fiorentina beating Werder Bremen on away goals, and Juventus pipping 1. FC Köln 3–2.
The final was to be played over two legs, with the first leg to be held in Turin, while the second was held in Stadio Partenio in Avellino – Fiorentina's home stadium was under renovation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, and the fixture was originally moved to the Stadio Renato Curi in Perugia, fairly close to Florence, but was then moved further away as punishment for supporters having staged a pitch invasion during the Werder Bremen tie. Avellino, despite being in Southern Italy, was a town with many fans of the "Bianconeri" and this concerned the "Viola" supporters. However, worries turned to anger when, with the score tied 1–1 in Turin, officials missed an apparent push by Juventus' Pierluigi Casiraghi on Fiorentina’s Celeste Pin, allowing Angelo Alessio's deflected shot to fire the home side in front. Juventus ended up winning 3–1, and during the post-match interview, Pin was heard shouting 'ladri' (thieves) at Juventus' manager Dino Zoff. Between the two legs, Juventus' goalkeeper Stefano Tacconi reminded Fiorentina that, while they might win the war of words, his side would win on the pitch. The second leg ended 0–0, and Juventus became the first Italian team (sixth across Europe) to win two UEFA Cup titles.
Transfer of Roberto Baggio.
Pontello was suffering from economic difficulties by this time, and was considering the sale of the club's prized asset: Roberto Baggio. Juventus were the club willing to pay a then world-record fee of 25 billion lire (£8 million), the world record transfer for a footballer at the time. His transfer led to severe riots in the streets of Florence and fans laid siege to the club’s headquarters; reports described bricks, chains and Molotov cocktails being thrown. In the two days following the transfer, Pontello was forced to take refuge in the Stadio Artemio Franchi, while 50 injuries and nine arrests were recorded. Baggio was called a 'traitor', but he still held the city of Florence and its football team close to his heart. On his return to his former home, he refused to take a penalty awarded to Juventus and was seen embracing a Viola scarf thrown by the Florentine supporters while waving it in the direction of the Curva Fiesole, the stronghold of the club's ultras. While this endeared him to the Fiorentina followers, it caused a rift between him and Juventus supporters.
1990s and 2000s.
Fiorentina were relegated in 1993, and although they made it back the very next year, the rivalry took on a somewhat one-sided dimension in the following years. Both sides had scandals to deal with in the 2000s, as Fiorentina declared bankruptcy in June 2002 and was re-established by the della Valle brothers in August 2002 as "Associazione Calcio Fiorentina e Fiorentina Viola", playing in Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. Former Juventus player, Angelo di Livio, was the only player to remain at the club as they returned to top-flight football in two years. Both teams, among others, were implicated in the 2006 Calciopoli scandal, which relegated Juventus to Serie B, and revoked their last two titles. Fiorentina meanwhile were given a 15-point penalty applied to the next season.
In 2012, the hierarchies of the two clubs clashed after Juventus made a late bid to hijack Fiorentina’s pursuit of Dimitar Berbatov. In the end, the Bulgarian snubbed both clubs for Fulham, but this did not stop the Fiorentina owners from claiming their rivals 'knew nothing of the values of honesty, fair play and sporting ethics.'
Transfer of Federico Bernardeschi.
History repeated itself for Fiorentina in the summer of 2017, with the della Valle brothers looking to sell the club but with no takers. Many top players, including Matías Vecino, Gonzalo Rodríguez, Borja Valero, and Ciprian Tătărușanu were released or sold as the owners wanted to recoup funds rather than invest in the club. They wished to renew the contract of local star, Federico Bernardeschi, but he was unwilling to renew his deal with the "Viola" and instead secured a transfer to rivals Juventus for €40 million on a five-year deal. Fans responded with vulgar banners saying 'A chi non piacerebbe sputarti in faccia... Bernardeschi gobbo di merda', which translates to 'Who wouldn't like to spit in your face, Bernardeschi you shitty hunchback'. On 9 February 2018, Bernardeschi returned to Florence, receiving vulgar insults throughout the match. He scored a free kick in the second half to silence the crowd.

Dear Life (High Valley song)

"Dear Life" is a song recorded by Canadian country music duo High Valley for their fifth studio album of the same name (2016). Group member Brad Rempel co-wrote the song with Seth Mosley and Ben Stennis, while Mosley co-produced the track with Mike "X" O'Connor. The song was first released digitally as the second promotional single on October 28, 2016, and was later released to Canadian country radio July 17, 2017 as the album's third Canadian single and fifth overall single.
Composition.
"Dear Life" is a Bluegrass-inspired song that features a "percussive" chorus and acoustic verses. The song's lyrics address making choices as one grows up and was inspired by the duo's kids. Drums feature prominently in the song's instrumentation, and "Dear Life"'s production has been compared to Avicii's "Hey Brother", which combines elements of country music with electronic dance music.
Chart performance.
"Dear Life" peaked at number five on the Canada Country chart, earning the group their ninth consecutive top-10 single.

Placid Olofsson

Dr OSB Placid Olofsson (born as Károly Olofsson, Rákosszentmihály, Hungary, 23 December 1916 – Budapest, Hungary, 15 January 2017) was a Hungarian Benedictine monk, priest, teacher and Gulag victim.
In 1946, he was interned in the [[Soviet Union]] in a [[Gulag]] labour camp on the basis of fake charges, where he spent ten years. He found there his new vocation: to keep the other prisoners in countenance. After his return to [[Hungary]] with his teachings, lectures and books, he gave faith and hope for life to thousands of people.
Life.
Early years.
On his father's side he was of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent, on his mother's side of [[Danube Swabian]]. His father, Gusztáv Olofsson, was a professor of [[descriptive geometry]] at the [[Technical University of Budapest]] and later high school teacher in Budapest, who converted from [[Lutheranism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]]. His mother was Jusztina Reihardt. He had only one sister, Jusztina who became a nun in [[Pressbaum]], [[Austria]].
After completing the four years of elementary school, his father enrolled him in the Szent Benedek Benedictine Secondary School. His head teacher was the famous Benedictine monk Ferenc Xavér Szunyogh. During his high school years, the spirit of the school and scouting greatly influenced him. In 1933, he took part on the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in [[Gödöllő]], [[Hungary]].
Studies.
As a teenager Olofsson did not want to become a monk. His role models were his teachers at school, whom he looked up to. But over time he realised that he should join monasticism, so he applied to the [[Pannonhalma Archabbey]]. His [[noviciate]] started on 6 August 1933. He enrolled at the [[University of Budapest]] and besides [[theology]] studied [[Germanistics]], [[Hungarian studies]] and [[humanities]]. He also received a doctorate.
In 1935 Olofsson studied at the [[University of Munich]] for two semesters.
He was ordained on 18 June 1939 and took the monk name "Placid" after [[Saint Placidus]], a disciple of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]] on [[Monte Cassino]]. His motto became:
Second World War.
Olofsson worked as a [[chaplain]] for a year in [[Győr]], but shortly afterwards became a priest in the army because the [[Second World War]] broke out. He gave the injured people spiritual support in the [[field hospital]] of [[Komárom]]. One time during his time preaching in the church he sharply criticized the officer corps with examples he heard from the injured. As a consequence of that he was brought before the military court and was officially decommissioned.
Then Olofsson became a teacher in [[Sopron]] where, besides teaching humanities, he held worldview lectures on [[Capitalism]], [[Socialism]], [[Fascism]], [[Nationalsocialism]], and [[Christianity]], until the [[Operation Margarethe|occupation]] by Germany. Then he was relocated to [[Budapest]] where he also worked as a teacher until the end of the war.
Soviet occupation.
In 1945, [[Jusztinián György Serédi]] named him as the cardinal advisor of [[Margit Slachta]]'s [[Sisters of Social Service]]. So he candidated at the first free election after the end of the German occupation on the party list of the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party]] under Slachta's political party, the [[Christian Women's League]]. He campaigned hard for the organisation. The [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1945|election]] was a great success for the conservatives. After winning one seat, Olofsson passed it on to another candidate of the Christian Women's League. After the [[Russian–Hungarian relations, 1945–1991|Soviet occupation of Hungary]] the majority of the media came under Soviet control. Articles appeared in the news criticizing Placid Olofsson and his activity.

Piotr Dunin Wolski

Piotr Dunin Wolski of the Łabędź coat of arms (1531 - 20 August 1590) was bishop of Płock from 1577 and Przemyśl from 1576, chancellor of the Crown from 1574 and chancellor of the Crown from 1576, diplomatic representative of the Republic in the Kingdom of Spain in 1561, internuncio of the Republic in Spain in 1569.
Family.
He was the son of Paweł Dunin-Wolski, the grand crown chancellor, the Poznań bishop (1544-1546) and Dorota Wiewiecka h. Jastrzębiec. He had four brothers and six sisters.
Early life.
He studied abroad (Padua, Rome, Madrid). In 1545 he received the Poznań canon. After returning from Italy, he stayed at the court of King Zygmunt August, where he became known as a man especially talented for foreign languages and for service in diplomacy. Hence, in 1560, after the death of Queen Bona, he was sent to Madrid in Spain, where he spent 10 years, trying to regain the so-called. Neapolitan sums. After returning to Poland, he was again sent to Spain after the death of Piotr Barzego, the castellan of Przemyśl and a Polish deputy who made wrong decisions in state matters, which required immediate intervention and repair. As a member, he was also sent to Pope Gregory XIII. His diplomatic successes were due to very good knowledge of Italian, French and Spanish. Canceled from Spain, he returned to Poland in 1573.
Episcopal career.
In recognition of his diplomatic talent, Henryk Walezy appointed him in 1574, at the coronation sejm of the Crown Deputy, and then Stefan Batory as the Grand Chancellor of the Crown in 1576 and the Bishop of Przemyśl. Shortly thereafter, he submitted the chancellor's seal to Jan Zamoyski, and having not yet approved the papacy for the diocese of Przemyśl, he was nominated for the bishopric in Płock, where his rule lasted from 5 July 1577 until his death on 28 August 1590.
In 1575 he signed the election of Emperor Maximilian II Habsburg. In 1589, he was a signatory of the ratification of the Bytom-Będzin treaty at the pacification parliament.
As a bishop of Płock, he twice conducted a diocesan synod in Płock and Pułtusk (1586 and 1589), which contributed to the reception of the reform undertaken at the Council of Trent in the diocese of Płock. He built the bishop's palace in Wyszków (1589); he renewed the collegiate church in Pułtusk.
He was also known as a bibliophile - imported from abroad books he had set in light yellow parchment and brown skin. Accumulated books were donated by the Kraków Academy (about 1000 volumes) and the library of the Płock chapter (130 works).

Dodge T-, V-, W-Series

In 1939 Dodge presented a completely new designed line of pickups and trucks. Formally the T series for 1939, V series for 1940, and the W series from 1941 through 1947, the trucks became mostly known as the Dodge Job-Rated trucks.
With streamlined, Art Deco styled front sheetmetal, and introducing the concept of "Job-Rated" truck configurations, Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit the job they were buying it for.
As a result, the 1939 to 1947 Dodge pickup / truck range was offered in a bewilderingly large number of available variants and model codes.
Six different payload classes, a wide range of bodies, and more than twenty different wheelbase-lengths were manufactured, and fitted with different sized versions of the Chrysler-sourced inline six-cylinder side-valve engines — from the half-ton TC pickup on a 116-inch wheelbase to three-ton tractor cabs. Nevertheless, mechanically, the trucks were all very similar, with solid axles front and rear and leaf springs at all four corners. With World War II taking up most of production capacity from 1942 to 1945, the 1939 styling continued largely unchanged through 1947, as engineering and production became the main focus.
The Dodge trucks enjoyed some popularity before the war, and the last of them built in 1942, before Dodge turned to mostly military production, had progressed to the
W-series model name. When they resumed sales post-war, they continued as the 1946 Dodge W-series.
Historic author on Dodge trucks, Don Bunn, noted that the 1939 to 1947 Job-Rated trucks represent a very significant segment in Dodge history. They were the first to be mass-produced in the new, huge (Mound Road) Warren truck plant. The Job-Rated trucks also formed the basis for Dodge's first light-duty military four-wheel drives, the 1940 half-ton Dodge VC series, which in turn further developed into the world's first factory 4WD commercial pickups: the Dodge Power Wagon. And lastly, Dodge was the first of the Big Three U.S. auto manufacturers to offer a diesel powered truck — all the more exceptional, given that Chrysler engineered and built their heavy-duty diesel engines all in-house. Today, this series is the most popular pickups with Dodge truck collectors.
General.
After Dodge joined forces with Graham Brothers trucks from 1925 onwards, Dodge and Graham trucks, marketed through Dodge's vast dealer network, were offered in various capacities, ranging from a half ton to three tons. In May 1928 "Power Wagon" magazine already computed a "truly impressive" 1,842 possible configuration combinations, of available models, styles, payload ratings and other options.
For 1939, Dodge rolled out a striking, modern design, new from the ground up, except for the updated drivetrains – and, as before, offering an exceptionally large number of available variants. In the later 1930s, streamlined styling had become a virtual requirement for anything from appliances, cars, boats, planes — even trucks, trains, and architecture. The new, 'Job-Rated' Dodge trucks followed suit, and were completely representative of the 'Streamline Moderne', Art Deco based style, inspired by aerodynamic design, and characterized by elongated horizontal lines and curving forms, to give the impression of sleekness and modernity.
The all new, all-steel cabs featured a front-end design with a barrel-shaped base, and a sharp V-shaped grille; long, sleek, crowned front and rear fenders, with embossed "speed lines" on the lower rears of each fender – and a new sloped, two-piece windshield, that could be opened for increased airflow. The headlamps were still free-standing, but were mounted in bullet-shaped pods. From the half-tons to the three-ton models, the new trucks all featured the same distinctive design – the heavy-duty models only stood out taller, on larger wheels and tires.
The unique styling of the trucks, was only really changed in 1940, when Dodge trucks began using sealed-beam headlamps and were equipped with marker lights mounted on the headlamp housing. For the most part, after 1940, year-to-year appearance changes were very minimal. The grille design was slightly changed again in 1941, and this style continued through 1947, except for the lower chrome strips, which were omitted post war.
The Job-Rated trucks had stronger frames than previous Dodge trucks, using steel with a higher tensile strength, and the frame-rails extended further forward past the engine than before, such that the truck's beefy, channel-type bumpers tied the rails together, reinforcing the frame. After World War II, several changes were made to production truck chassis parts, based on reliability experience gained during military service – for instance stronger differentials and larger axle shafts were used in post-war trucks, and steering boxes were beefed up as well.
All in all, Dodge advertised as many as 175 basic chassis models, and seven engine variants, as well as different "job-rated" choices of clutches, transmissions, axles, gear ratios, springs, tires and brakes. In 1941, General Motors introduced new trucks for Chevrolet and GMC, that literally became known as their Art Deco trucks, and advertised them as "The Right Trucks for all Trades". Both Dodge's 'job-rated' trucks, and GM's 'Art-Decos' are recognized as prime truck examples of the 1930s Streamline Moderne architecture and design style.
Model name codes.
Introduced as the T-Series for the 1939 model year, the line evolved into the V-series for 1940, and W-series for 1941, but the 'W' was retained until the end of sales in 1947.
The bottom of the range TC, and its successors VC and WC, were -ton rated, on a wheelbase. As the second letter in the model code progressed in the alphabet, the payload rating typically also went up, however this was not implemented consistently. Although the TD-15, VD-15 and WD-15 were -ton rated, the TD-20 and -21 and its later VD and WD versions were one-tonners. The -15s and the -20s had a wheelbase, but the 1-ton could also be had with (the TD-/VD-/WD-21). Second letter 'E' models only existed in the form of the 1939 TE versions. TF-, VF-, and WF-models were either 1-ton or -ton, ranging in wheelbase from . Second letter G- and H-models were consistently -ton and 2-ton rated, respectively, ranging in wheelbase from . The -ton rated J-models weren't introduced until the 1946 WJ-55 through WJ-59, ranging from in wheelbase. The K-lettered models were consistently 3-ton rated, but the L-lettered models went against the naming pattern – they were only 2-ton rated. Both were offered in wheelbases ranging through 1942. From 1946 instead there were 3-ton WK- and WR-models ranging in wheelbase from .
Engine.
Dodge's Job-Rated trucks used flathead sixes, originally developed by Plymouth, throughout the 1939–1947 range. In the light half-ton trucks initially a 201.3 cu.in. engine was standard; with in 1939, but uprated to in 1940, and by 1941. The three-quarter and one-ton trucks used a 217.8 cu.in. engine from 1939 to 1941, rated at initially, then at 82 Hp, and at in 1941.
Starting in 1942 (just before civilian production ended), the 201.3 cu.in. engines were dropped from the range, and the -ton light-duty models received the larger 218 cu.in. six, like the 3/4-ton pickups, going up to gross after the war, while the one-ton trucks got a larger 230.2 cu.in. (instead of the 218), with , until the line-up was replaced in 1947.
A three-speed manual was standard issue, while a four-speed with a compound first gear was an option.
The 1939–1947 TK- and TL- through WK- and WL-models were also available with a diesel engine – Dodge's own diesel engine – Dodge and Mack Trucks were the only two American automakers of the period before World War II, to have their own diesel engines. An additional 6-volt auxiliary generator debuted in 1941 on the diesel engines. The unit furnished power for lighting, instruments, and horns. Diesel sales were extremely limited however, counting as many as 75 units sold in 1939, 134 units in 1940, and 195 rigs in 1941.
Bodies and options.
Besides with the "Express" pick-up bodywork, the Job-Rated trucks were available in cab/chassis, cowl/chassis, or bare chassis (for third party custom body) versions.
At the bottom of the range, Dodge offered the three now common pick-up classes (-ton, -ton and one-ton), as well as a 1-ton pick-up. Dodge's half-ton pickups, on a wheelbase with a 7-foot box, were changed to the 70 HP 201 cu.in. L-head straight-six. The 3/4- and 1-ton models kept the 75 HP 218 cubic inch L-head six, either on a wheelbase with a 7-foot box, or a wheelbase with a 9-foot bed. Dodge's 1-ton pick-up, offered from the Job-Rated trucks launch in 1939 until the 1942 switch to all-wartime production, consisted of the long-wheelbase one-ton model with 9-foot bed, but on bigger wheels and tires.
Aside from as pickups, the lightest models in the range, the wheelbase TC/VC/WC half-tons, were also offered as a delivery truck, either with solid steel "panel" van body, or open canvas-covered canopy or screenside configuration.
After the war, both the 1-ton pickup, and the long one-ton pickup with the nine-foot bed were dropped.
Post-war available equipment options included a larger clutch, four-speed transmission, oversize tires, electric driver's wiper, heater, chrome windshield frame, adjustable visor, driver's armrest, dome light, turn signals, "airfoam" seat with leather upholstery, and an AM radio.
Models used by the military.
Purpose-built four-wheel drive.
After Dodge supplied the U.S. Army with its first four-wheel drive truck in 1934, more modern -tonners were developed, and 1,700 RF-40-X-4(USA) trucks were supplied in 1938, and 292 TF-40-X-4(USA) in 1939. In 1940, Dodge gained an Army contract to design and build -ton 4×4 military trucks in several styles using many commercial truck parts. Based on the VC-Series, and internally called the T-202 series, the VC-1 through VC-6 came with essentially stock front-end sheetmetal. Similarly, their 116-inch wheelbase and 201-cubic-inch 79-horsepower six-cylinder engine shared much with Dodge's civilian -ton VC. The following year, the T202 was replaced by the T-207 series trucks. Again rated as -tonners, they featured a military-specific hood, grille, and fenders. These trucks were powered by the 218-cubic-inch six of 85 horsepower taken from Dodge's - and one-ton commercial models. Eventually, the military trucks were substantially redesigned, and uprated to -tons with a 230-cubic-inch engine with 92 hp. Together with the 1941 -tons, these were built from 1942 until the end of the war as the Dodge WC series military trucks. Some 30 were modified as armored trucks by the French in Syria prior to WWII and known as the "Automitrailleuse Dodge Tanake". The Tanake was fitted with a 37mm cannon M1916 and two or three FM 24/29 light machine guns and a crew of 5. The vehicles served with French Foreign Legion, both Vichy and Free French units during WWII and post-war used by the Syrian government in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.
Stock models and specifications.
The U.S. military also used some of Dodge's light truck models in mostly stock, two-wheel drive form. Technical manuals of U.S. Army military vehicles offer some more detailed specifications on three such models: the 1947 model year WC and WD-15 models, and the 160 inch wheelbase version of the SNL G-number 618 aka the WF-32.
Additionally there were 4x2, civilian based variants built either as Canadian "Modified Conventional Pattern" or "Canadian Military Pattern trucks", called the D15 (15cwt, or ¾-ton – engineering code T-222), and the D60S and D60L (60cwt, or 3-ton, engineering code T-110, with a short or long wheelbase). The Canadian models were built with a engine with a 25" block, that was unique to them, and they had beefed up rear axles. Chrysler Corporation of Canada produced a total of 180,816 military Dodge trucks during 1939-1945.
Dodge T-234 "China / Burma" truck.
A special case in between stock commercial and dedicated military trucks, was the T-234 "China / Burma Road" truck, which was built as part of the Allied cooperation with China against Japan, in the war and just thereafter. From October 1944 through March 1946, Dodge built 15,000 trucks, that used a special order combination of their most heavy-duty off-the-shelf components, to overland supplies from India to China over the very rough Ledo Road (later renamed after Joseph Stilwell), to an extent to specifications personally drawn up by Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, then president and commander of the Nationalist Chinese forces. Chiang Kai-shek asked Roosevelt himself for 15,000 two-and-a-half-ton trucks capable of handling the Burma Road, requiring them to have an engine of at least 300 cubic inches and a 5-speed transmission.&lt;br&gt;
The trucks were built with a near standard civilian closed cab – right-hand drive because Burma was under British rule – but fitted with a flat, military-style grille &amp; brush guard, and wide open, almost flat fenders, to avoid mud build-up clogging the wheels rotating, and otherwise stood out by having a 60-gallon fuel tank. In order for the trucks to function on the gruelling journey over the Himalayas, Dodge fitted not only heavy-duty springs and steering gear, but went sofar as to fit tri-metal aircraft grade bearings and aeroplane-type shock absorbers. Radiators were fitted with an overflow tank, to return the cooled water to the sealed cooling system. Ground clearance was , with a 50° approach angle, and 28.5° departure. Front axles were widened to give wider tread. Nevertheless, the average life of the trucks was only about five trips.
It has been commented that the front sheet metal design of the T-234 Burma Dodge shows remarkable resemblance to that of the post-war Dodge Power Wagons, and may well have influenced it.

James Hall Mason Knox

Reverend James Hall Mason Knox D.D., LL.D (June 10, 1824 – January 21, 1903) was a Presbyterian divine and educator, serving as the 8th president of Lafayette College.
Early life.
Knox was born in New York City in 1824. His father, Rev. John Knox D.D., was the head pastor of the Collegiate Dutch Church for forty years, and his mother was the eldest daughter of John M. Mason.
Knox attended Columbia College, graduating in 1841, before studying theology at the Seminary of the Reformed Church in New Brunswick, New Jersey. In 1845, he was licensed to preach by the classis of New York, and was ordained in September 1846 by the presbytery of Newton, New Jersey.
Career.
Following his ordainment, Knox led an illustrious career as a pastor throughout the northeast. For the first five years, Knox preached at the Presbyterian Church in German Valley, New Jersey, where he was described as "one of the most popular and efficienct pastors that the church ever had." He then went to the Reformed Dutch Church in Easton, Pennsylvania, for a period of two years, where he began a relationship with nearby Lafayette College, eventually joining its board of trustees. Following this, he was the pastor for sixteen years at the First Presbyterian Church in Germantown, Pennsylvania, before being transferred to Bristol, Pennsylvania where he spent the next ten years.
Knox was called out of the ministry while at Bristol to accept the role of president of Lafayette College as its eighth president in 1883. The board of trustees at Lafayette had chosen Knox unanimously upon the resignation of his predecessor, William Cassady Cattell. Cattell, who has just resigned after a long twenty-year tenure, was a popular figure in the city as he helped steady the very financially troubled college during his term. Knox continued in his predecessor's success, by making sure the college's endowment was filled and interest in the school was still high.
In an attempt to raise the college's endowment, Knox was instrumental in securing a donation from Daniel B. Fayerweather, who ran the world's largest leather manufacturing business in the world, known as Fayerweather &amp; Ladew. Fayerweather left many small fortunes to colleges around the country, and to Lafayette he left the amount of $100,000 (equivalent to $ in dollars), and later had a dormitory on campus named after him.
Knox resigned the presidency in June, 1890, and spent the next two years in Europe before returning to the United States, choosing to live in Baltimore. He was elected as vice-president of the Presbyterian Historical Society in 1890, a position in which he served until his death.
Personal life.
Knox was married twice. His first wife was Louise Wakeman, whom he married on September 17, 1846. Together they had two children, and in 1871 Louise died. On December 16, 1869, Knox married Helen R. Thompson, and together they had one son.
In 1861, Knox received the honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity from his alma mater, Columbia College. Later, he received the honorary degree of Legum Doctor from the same college in 1885. He was also a member of the Victoria Institute in London.
After his presidency at Lafayette, the college recognized his service by dedicating to him a building, named Knox Hall.
Knox died of pneumonia on January 21 in his home in Baltimore.

FS Class E.431

The FS Class E.431 was a class of three-phase AC electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS).
History.
The E.431 was a class of 37 locomotives, built between 1922 and 1925 by Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB), divided into three batches, the last in collaboration with Ansaldo. The locomotives were designed and constructed to be suitable for hauling heavy trains at 100 km / h which, at the time, was considered the limit for the three-phase system. The extension of the electrified network with the three-phase system had come to involve the regions of Piedmont, Liguria and part of Lombardy. This included the cities of Turin, Genoa and indirectly Milan. With associated lines, international transits were possible. These lines were used by fast and important international trains with heavy loads (up to 20 carriages) hence the need for machines suitable for this type of service.
In practice, the E.431 did not live up to expectations. In particular, the cascade connection of the motors at the lower speeds gave insufficient tractive effort, affecting performance during starting and uphill travel. They were not, therefore, used on the Frejus and Brenner lines, while on the remaining climbs, in particular on those that lead from the Ligurian coast to the hinterland, they were always used in multiple. These problems were solved, even if not definitively, with Class E.432 which had different control systems. On the flat, the E.431s could show off their speed, hauling the trains for which they were designed, but even here they sometimes worked in multiple. Some attempts to improve performance when running in cascade mode were made during the early years of service but they were not very successful.
With the conversion of the three-phase lines to direct current operation, the E.431s were progressively withdrawn but some locomotives remained in service on local trains until the end of the three-phase system occurred in 1976.
Technical features.
Mechanical part.
The E.431 was the first three-phase locomotive for passenger trains to have four-axle drive, to increase the adhesive weight. Each end drive axle was linked to the adjacent carrier axle by a Zara bogie. This arrangement, also adopted in many other locomotives, allowed better curve registration given the generally tortuous route of the lines in Italy. The two motors drove through a triangular connecting rod and horizontal coupling rods transmitted the motion from the driving axle to the coupled axles. The wheels were of the type used on steam locomotives, with balance weights and cranks at 90 degrees.
On a sturdy frame there was a central cabin in which the two traction motors, which were dismountable from below, were placed. At the ends there were two short bonnets which contained the auxiliary equipment, including fans, rheostat, compressors and brake reservoirs, as well as a reversing switch for the selection of the direction of travel.
Electrical part.
The electrical part consisted of two traction motors whose stators were switchable between six or eight poles. With the cascade connection, in which the current induced in the rotor of one motor fed the stator of the other motor, both motors ran at half speed. The available speeds were:
The current limitation during starting and switching was obtained through a liquid rheostat containing a 2% solution of sodium carbonate in water as electrolyte. The electrolyte was cooled by a heat exchanger which transferred heat to another liquid circuit containing fresh water.
Current was picked up from the overhead line through two trolley poles with "spades" - a pattern common in three-phase locomotives of the time.
Multiple unit control.
After the encouraging results obtained with the small-wheeled locomotives FS Class E.551 and FS Class E.554, it was decided to extend the experiment with "Ligurian" multiple unit control to some large-wheeled locomotives. The locomotives chosen for the experiment included two Class E.333 and E.431.023 and 026. The chosen machines, modified in the early months of 1960, behaved well in multiple control, demonstrating the validity of the solution adopted. 
The success of the "Ligurian" multiple control led to the idea of adopting it as standard equipment on all three-phase locomotives, excluding only the oldest types. For Class E.431 the transformation of a further eight units was arranged, but it was only performed on two of them. These were E.431.018 and E.431.036. On this pair of locomotives, a high voltage coupling was added which allowed the second unit to operate with lowered trolleys, in order to avoid a speed limit imposed on double-traction locomotives on the Turin - Fossano - Ceva line.
Preservation.
E.431.027 is exhibited at the Savigliano site of the Piedmont Railway Museum (MFP) and E.431.037 is in the Technical Museum of Speyer, in the Rhineland-Palatinate.

Jan Doliwa

Jan of the Doliwa coat of arms (died 17 March 1335) was Bishop of Poznań from 1324 - 1335.
Little is known about his youth. We know that before taking over the bishop's throne in Poznań he was the office of the Archdiocese of Poznań.
In July 1324, the Poznań chapter elected him another bishop. This election was approved by Janisław - Archbishop of Gniezno, who made episcopal ordination in the autumn of the same year in Sochaczew. Belonging to the Doliwów family, Jan belonged to the trusted king Władysław Łokietek. In the last months of 1324, Bishop Jan sent food to reinforce Pyzdry, and in June 1325 he belonged to the signatories of a covenant between the king and the West Pomeranian princes against Brandenburg in Nakło. In the same year, Pope John XXII appointed him the conservator of the Owińska monastery, ordering him also to extort Prince Bolesław III the Spendable to separate the Duchy of Legnica's brother. In February 1326 Jan took part in the synod of the Gniezno metropolis, and in 1329 during Łokietek's stay at the Poznań castle, he belonged to his immediate surroundings.
In March 1331, the bishop, together with the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Cracow bishop, were appointed by the Pope to be the executors of the atonement to be given to the Chełmno bishopric for the losses suffered, and in the event of a refusal they had the right to lay a curse on the order. In July of the same year, the Teutonic invasion ravaged the bishop's estate - destroying Słupca and many villages belonging to the bishop, as well as many other cities in Greater Poland, such as Pyzdry, Środa Wielkopolska and Kostrzyn, where churches were burnt. In the Warsaw trial, the court found that the damage, without the temptation of the temples, amounted to 8,200 silver fines. After the death of Łokietek, the bishop concelebrated the coronation mass of Casimir the Great.
During his term of office, the parish church in Krerów was founded, the estate of the bishops lying in both Greater Poland and Mazovia was merged, several villages were located, and a privilege for millers in the estate of the diocese was issued. The modern bishop calendar of Włocławek described him as a good and generous man, while Jan Długosz showed him in a negative way, accusing him of extravagance and lack of care for those in need.

Robert Black (Canadian politician)

Robert Black (born March 27, 1962) is a Canadian Senator from Ontario. He was named to the Senate by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on February 15, 2018. Prior to his appointment, Black was a leader in the agricultural community. He has been chief executive of the Rural Ontario Institute since 2010 and has also been involved in the 4-H farm youth organization since the 1970s. He subsequently joined the Independent Senators Group and, on November 4, 2019, he joined the Canadian Senators Group.
Black has also been a councillor on the Wellington County council from 2014 until his appointment to the Senate and was a civil servant with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture for fifteen years. He has also served on the Ontario Agricultural Hall of Fame's board of directors.

Professional career.
Redman turned professional following the 2018 NCAA Golf Championship and made his professional debut at the Memorial Tournament. By turning pro, he forfeited his exemptions into the 2018 U.S. Open and 2018 Open Championship which he earned via his U.S. Amateur win.
In June 2019, Redman shot a 62 to Monday qualify for the Rocket Mortgage Classic. In the tournament, he shot 68-67-67-67 and finished solo second to Nate Lashley, who ironically got into the field as an alternate after failing to secure his spot through the same qualifier. This earned him $788,400, entry into the 2019 Open Championship and Special Temporary Membership on the PGA Tour for the rest of the season, after starting 2019 on the third-tier Mackenzie Tour. Although he played in only six PGA events during the 2018–19 season, the 400 points he earned as a nonmember were just enough to surpass the 376 points needed to qualify for PGA Tour membership in the 2019–20 season. In 2020, he qualified for the FedExCup Playoffs, where he ranked number 71, just missing the BMW Championship. In 2021, Redman tied for third in the Safeway Open.

Da zhidu lun

The Dà zhìdù lùn (abbreviated DZDL), (Chinese: 大智度論, Wade-Giles: "Ta-chih-tu lun"; Japanese: "Daichido-ron" (as in Taishō Tripiṭaka no. 1509); "The Treatise on the Great Prajñāpāramitā") is a massive Mahāyāna Buddhist treatise and commentary on the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra (The Sūtra of Transcendental Wisdom in Twenty-five Thousand Lines). The title has been reconstructed into Sanskrit as *Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa. It is an encyclopedic compendium or summa of Mahayana Buddhist doctrine. 
The "Dà zhìdù lùn" was translated into Chinese by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva (344–413 CE) and his Chinese team. The colophon to this work claims it is written by the Buddhist philosopher Nāgārjuna (c. 2nd century), but various scholars such as Étienne Lamotte have questioned this attribution. According to Hans-Rudolf Kantor, this work was "fundamental for the development of the Chinese Sanlun, Tiantai, Huayan, and Chan schools."
Textual history.
The DZDL survives only in the Chinese translation of 100 scrolls made by the Kuchean monk Kumārajīva from 402 to 406 CE. According to the primary sources, the Indic text consisted of 100,000 gāthās (lines), or 3,200,000 Sanskrit syllables, which was condensed by Kumārajīva by two-thirds to obtain the 100 scrolls of the Chinese translation. Kumārajīva translated the first 34 scrolls in full, and abridged the rest of the material. It was translated by Kumārajīva, working together with his student Sengrui, who “stopped writing, argued for the right translation,” and “checked his translation against the original for the entire day” as well as with the Qin emperor Yao Xing. 
The DZDL became a central text for the East Asian Sanlun ( J. Sanron) or Madhyamaka school and also influenced all the major schools of Chinese Buddhism. The DZDL acted as a kind of Mahāyāna encyclopedia for East Asian Buddhist thought, similar to the status of the "Abhisamayalamkara" in Tibetan Buddhism. 
Traditionally, it is held that the text is by the Indian Madhyamaka philosopher Nagarjuna. Against the traditional attribution of the work to Nagarjuna, Étienne Lamotte as well as Paul Demiéville, concluded that the author must have been a Buddhist monk of the Sarvāstivāda or Mulasarvāstivāda school from Northwest India, learned in Abhidharma, who later converted to Mahāyāna and Madhyamaka and then composed "a voluminous exegetical treatise which is like a Mahāyāna reply to the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma". This is because the Abhidharma and Vinaya material found in this text coincides with that of the north Indian Sarvāstivāda tradition. This is a widely accepted view among modern scholars. Lamotte also remarked on the internal evidence of the text which shows that its author was likely from a region that was within the Kushan Empire. 
Hikata Ryusho however argues that there is an ancient nucleus of material in this text that could be attributed by Nagarjuna (as well as a large amount of later accretions). R. Hikata argued that while a part of the text was by Nagarjuna, it also included many “additions or insertions by Kumārajīva.” The Chinese scholar Yin Shun meanwhile, argues for the traditional attribution to Nagarjuna. In a recent study, Po-kan Chou has argued that the DZDL is a product of the editorship of Sengrui (352?-436?), Kumārajīva's student, co-translator and amanuensis. 
Content.
The text is primarily Mahayana and explains basic Mahayana doctrines such as "Prajñāpāramitā", and the other bodhisattva paramitas, but also includes much Sarvastivada Abhidharma, Jataka and early Buddhist content. As noted by Lamotte, "the Treatise cites, at length or in extracts, about a hundred sūtras of the Lesser Vehicle; the majority are borrowed from the Āgama collections". It also cites various Mahayana sutras, such as the Lotus Sutra and the Vimalakirti Sutra, the Dasabhumika Sutra, Gandavyuha Sutra, as well as various Jataka stories and Avadana literature. According to Akira Hirawaka, "The arguments of the "Ta-chih-tu lun", are primarily directed against the Vaibhasikas of the Sarvastivadin School."
The DZDL contains 90 chapters ("p'in") in 100 rolls ("kiuan"). It comprises two series of chapters, according to Lamotte the first series of 52 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 57c-314b) "appears to be an integral version of the Indian original" while the second series of 89 chapters (Taisho. 1509, p. 314b-756c) seems to be an abridgement. 
The content of the first series, which has been translated by Etienne Lamotte (Fr.) and Karma Migme Chodron (Eng.) is as follows:
Translations.
One third of this work was translated by Etienne Lamotte as "Le Traité de la Grande Vertu de Sagesse". This translation is regrettably replete with mistakes. An English translation from Lamotte's French was completed by Gelongma Karma Migme Chodron as "The Treatise on the Great Virtue of Wisdom".
Bhiksu Dharmamitra has also translated sections of this work into English, including chapters 17-30 ("Nagarjuna on the Six Perfections", Kalavinka press, 2008) and a collection of 130 stories and anecdotes extracted from the text ("Marvelous Stories from the Perfection of Wisdom", Kalavinka press, 2008).

Africa Aerospace and Defence Expo

The African Aerospace and Defence Expo (AAD) is an aerospace and defence exhibition held every two years at AFB Waterkloof, in Centurion, Gauteng, South Africa. The exhibition combines a trade exhibition and an air show. 
The AAD began in 1975 when the South African based aviation magazine World Airnews determined that a professional aerospace exhibition was appropriate, as distinguished from the traveling "barnstorming" air shows that were then prominent.
The first event was held October 1975 as "Aviation Africa", at Lanseria Airport near Johannesburg, South Africa under the sponsorship of the Commercial Aviation Association of Southern Africa. The same year, Lt. General Bob Rogers of the South African Air Force instituted an open day at AFB Waterkloof, in Centurion, which eventually turned into the Defence Exhibition of South Africa (DEXSA).
In 2000, Aviation Africa and DEXSA combined to become AAD. In 2006, the exhibition moved to AFB Ysterplaat in Cape Town. It returned to AFB Waterkloof in 2012.
The next AAD is scheduled for 16-20 September 2020.

Mikołaj II of Górka

Mikołaj of Kórnik (died 1382), was bishop of Poznań from 1375-1382.
Biography.
His family were of the Łodzia coat of arms. He was a son of Mikołaj from Będlewo, nephew of the bishop of Poznań, Jan of the Łodzia coat of arms. He studied law in Italy, finishing his doctorate with decrees, which he obtained before 1365. After returning to Poland (between July 9, 1365, and January 27, 1368) he became a cantor in Poznań. He also related to the court of Bodzanta, Bodzanty, who appointed him the court judge, in 1359 a canon of Cracow, and in 1364 as the vicar of Bishop.
In 1366, the Pope appointed him a canon of Gniezno, and in 1368 he received the provost of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Kraków. He was also a papal sub-collector, and from 1365 or 1366 to 1372 he was the office of the Chancellor of Greater Poland. Thanks to this last office, he established close relations with the court of King Ludwik Węgierski, which allowed him to remove political opponents, the most powerful of which was the Crown Deputy Chancellor Jan of Czarnków. Probably Nicholas contributed to accusing him of profaning the tomb of Casimir the Great and stealing the coronation insignia, which meant that Jan was deprived of office.
After the death of Jan of Lutogniew, the Poznań bishop's office slowed down. On May 7, 1375, he received the sacrament and sat on the throne of the Poznań bishop. As a bishop he began reconstruction in the Gothic style of the Poznań Cathedral and surrounded Słupca with walls. In politics, he was asking for favors and further assignments for the bishopric of the Mazovian Piasts, but otherwise he did not show any particular political line. In the consciousness of successive generations, his negative picture was fixed by Janek of Czarnków, who described him as a dishonest and corrupt man. He died on March 18, 1382, in Ciążeń, he was buried in the Poznań cathedral.

Last Night All My Dreams Came True

Last Night All My Dreams Came True is a live album by British indie rock band Wild Beasts. It was released 16 February 2018, under Domino Recording Company.
Production.
The album was recorded live over a two-day period at RAK Studios.
Critical reception.
"Last Night All My Dreams Came True" was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 73, based on 12 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 72 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 9 reviews.
Andy Gill from "The Independent" wrote: "It's a burly collection, with the band's flanged guitars and proggy synths asserting their refusal to follow any set style, and Hayden Thorpe's bristling vocals similarly stretching indie constraints; but when the only "new" track is jerry-rigged together from two old tracks, it all seems a bit unnecessary." Steven Loftin from "The Line of Best Fit" praised the vocals from the album, by saying: "The vocals of Hayden Thorpe and Tom Fleming, entwining with their falsetto and baritone beauty respectively, have always been impeccable in a live setting, and it's great to hear this forever immortalised as they run through key cuts from their back catalogue here." Phil Mongredien from "The Observer" stated: "It's unfortunate that [the album] draws rather so heavily on material from 2016's "Boy King", the first Wild Beasts album on which memorable moments were in short supply. It all adds up to a slightly anticlimactic exit for a great band."

James Christopher Monger of AllMusic explained "Written in the wake of a breakup with fellow Kiwi crooner Aldous Harding, the 11-track set is awash in post-midnight reverb and spilling over with the myopic despondency of heartbreak." Hal Horowitz of American Songwriter noted "singer-songwriter Marlon Williams creates a lasting, durable and above all emotionally poignant work that makes the inherent self-doubt, confusion and frustration of his split feel universal and distinctive."

Alan Loehle

Alan David Loehle (born 1954) is an American contemporary artist and professor of art at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, Georgia.
Education and career.
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Loehle received his B.F.A. from the University of Georgia in 1975 and his M.F.A. from the University of Arizona in 1979. He began exhibiting his paintings in Atlanta and New York City in 1983, and his work was featured in a 1999 print exhibition in "the Paris Review". He has been teaching at Oglethorpe since 2001, and received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Painting in 2007.
Paintings.
Loehle's work, which includes both paintings and drawings, is characterized by its ambiguity and disturbing images. A 2004 "Creative Loafing" article stated that his paintings are characterized by a "triumvirate of flesh: dogs, dwarfs and meat", describing his paintings as "...masterful ruminations on the slender cord separating life from death and humanity from debasement." His specific works include a series of three oil paintings and one small ink-and-brush work, which he produced from 1997 to 2002 as part of a series centered around an achondroplastic dwarf model. These works include "Walking Man", depicting an anonymous man walking on a desolate background landscape, and "the Head", depicting the same model standing over a severed pig head. He has said that the images in these paintings are meant to symbolize the human condition.

Tinea accusatrix

Tinea accusatrix is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1916. However the placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as "Tinea" (s.l.) "accusatrix". This species is endemic to New Zealand.
The wingspan is 8–10 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous with a short fine white median longitudinal line from the base and oblique white streaks from the costa at one-fourth and the middle reaching more than half across the wing, and shorter oblique marks from the dorsum opposite. There are seven white wedge-shaped marks from the costa on the posterior half, anteriorly somewhat oblique, posteriorly direct, one from the tornus and a dot on the termen beneath the apex, the space between these with violet and bronzy reflections. There is also a round deep black spot at the apex. The hindwings are light grey, with bronzy and purple reflections.

Uriel Górka

Uriel Górka of the Łodzia coat of arms (born around 1435 - died 21 January 1498) was bishop of Poznań and chancellor of the Crown. He was one of the most powerful men in Poland of his generation.
Early life.
He was the son of Łukasz I and Katarzyna Szamotulska. As a child, he was destined for the clergy. In spite of poor health, he studied at the Kraków Academy until 1453, and then in Italy and Germany, to study again in Bologna in 1463. The father tried for him numerous church prebends: in 1449 he became a Poznań canon, in 1453 Gniezno and Łęczyca, in 1467 Płock, Sandomierz and Kraków. In 1454 he received the position of Poznań provost, and in 1468 Gniezno. Such accumulation of dignity in the hands of one person required a special permission from the Roman Curia.
In 1473, thanks to the support of his father, he was appointed royal chancellor, even though he had no previous experience relating to that office. In 1478 he was in Rome as a royal deputy. During this stay, he received from the Pope the office of a papal payments collector for the Archdiocese of Gniezno, which he probably held until 1486. During this period, he established numerous relations with the Western European, and especially Nuremberg, banking houses, and Polish and Italian burgers in Polish cities. In the years 1473 - 1474 he was the administrator of the Archdiocese of Gniezno and, at the request of the king, he called a provincial synod to Łęczyca, who established the payment obligations of the clergy to the state.
After the death of Andrzej Bniński in 1479, he took the Poznań bishopric promised to him, while at the same time resigning from the office of the Crown Chancellor. His period of office on the bishop's throne in Poznan is poorly documented, but it is known that he was patron of the artists. He also brought records from Vischer's factory to his and his father's graves. He also ordered a service at the Albrecht Dürer plant.
He witnessed the release of the Piotrków Privilege in 1496.
In his estates he tried to grow vines. His only heir was his nephew, Łukasz II Górka. He died during a curative stay in Karlovy Vary on 21 January 1498.

Kincardine, Aberdeenshire

Kincardine was a burgh in Scotland, near the present-day village of Fettercairn. It served as the first county town of Kincardineshire.
The settlement gradually developed around Kincardine Castle. The origin of the castle is not known, although it has been popularly identified as the place of death of Kenneth II. The Carnegies were made stewards of the castle during the reign of William the Lion. In 1296, it was the location where John Balliol confessed to rebellion against Edward I of England. It was kept in good repair over the following centuries, and was visited by Mary Queen of Scots.
By 1532, the castle was a secondary residence of William Keith, 4th Earl Marischal, and appears to have been at the centre of small town, occupying about two hundred yards between gates on the main road. The Earl petitioned for Kincardine to be declared as a free burgh and county town for the Mearns. The petition claimed that the sheriff courts for the Mearns were already being held in the town, and that it was reputed to have previously been made a free burgh, but that the charter had been lost. He was successful, and on 27 January 1531/2, Kincardine became the county town of the newly created county of Kincardineshire.
By 1600, the burgh was in decline, and the sheriff and his deputes complained to the king that the accommodation for them was unsuitable, no tolbooth having been constructed; they were successful in having the county town moved to Stonehaven.
Without county town status, Kincardine quickly dwindled, and the castle fell into ruin. By the 1830s, it was described as a "mere hamlet" and it was noted that "only the foundations of the [castle] walls can be traced", and by 1870 there were no surviving houses. The castle foundations survive today, forming a Scheduled Monument. The cemetery of the former St Catherine of Siena Chapel also survives, with part of its wall and an 18th-century gravestone.

Javier Milei

Javier Gerardo Milei (Buenos Aires, Argentina; 22 October 1970) is an Argentine libertarian economist, author, radio conductor and public speaker sympathetic to the Austrian School of economic thought. He became widely known for his regular TV appearances where he has been critical of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Mauricio Macri and Alberto Fernández administrations. Milei considers himself to be a "short-term minarchist", although "philosophically an anarcho-capitalist".
The economist will compete for a place in the Chamber of Deputies for Buenos Aires for the Avanza Libertad coalition. He said "Before raising a tax, or creating a tax, I'll amputate my arm".
Biography.
Early life and youth.
He was born in 1970 to a bus driver, in a family of Italian descent. Milei did high school at Cardenal Copello and decided to pursue a career in economics at the age of 12 after José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz's Economy Administration led the country to a devastating hyperinflation. In late adolescence and early adulthood he was a goalkeeper for Chacarita Juniors until 1989. He also sang in the band "Everest," which played mostly Rolling Stones covers. In a TV show he declared that he currently never visits his parents and that "both of them are dead" to him. To support this view he recalled his college time in which his parents made his life miserable.
Career.
Having obtained an economics degree at the private Belgrano University (Licentiate) and received two Master's Degrees at the Instituto de Desarrollo Económico y Social (IDES) and the private Torcuato di Tella University. He became a chief economist at Máxima AFJP (a private pension company), a head economist at Estudio Broda (a financial advising company) and a government consultant at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. He used to be a senior economist at HSBC as well.,
Since 2012, he leads the division of Economic Studies, Fundación Acordar, a think tank of national scope. He is also a member of the B20, the Economic Policy Group of International Chamber of Commerce (an advisor to the G20), and the World Economic Forum. He is a specialist in economic growth and has been professor of several economic subjects in Argentine universities and abroad. He has authored 9 books. Currently, he works for Argentine tycoon Eduardo Eurnekián.
For more than 21 years he has been University Professor of Macroeconomics, Economics of Growth, Microeconomics and Mathematics for Economists. Since 2016 he has been trying to merge Austrian economics concepts with Monetarism concepts, as he understands Ben Bernanke was the greatest central banker ever, a point of view rejected by austrian economists." Besides his academic career, Milei is the host of his own radio show named "Demoliendo mitos" ("Demolishing myths"), with frequent participations of the alberdian economist and businessman Gustavo Lazzari and other personalities such as the also alberdian lawyer Pablo Torres Barthe and the libertarian political scientist María Zaldívar.
Personal life.
Milei has been nicknamed "el Peluca" (the Wig) because of his eccentric hairstyle. 
 He has repeatedly said he does not comb his hair, and for this reason his hairstyle has received significant media attention. Regarding his romantic life he has suggested in a La Nación interview that he is a champion of free love, and in a local TV program stated that he took part in several threesomes and that he is a Tantra instructor, in his words being "capable of remaining three months without ejaculating" (sic). Nevertheless he identifies as a Catholic, who rejects the Magisterium of the Church. With regards to abortion, he has publicly expressed a strong pro-life position.
He owns five english mastiffs, the progenitor being 'Conan,' whom he regards as his 'son', and four of Conan's pups called Milton (for Milton Friedman), Murray (for Murray Rothbard), Robert and Lucas (both for Robert Lucas).
Criticism.
It has been pointed out that one important issue is that Milei makes constant use of mathematical formulae and charts throughout his writings to illustrate his points, which clearly contradicts the skeptical Austrian views on the usage of mathematics in economics, regarded by them as a social science. This is the main obstacle to frame Milei as an 'Austrian' economist. Although his conceptual framework is decidedly Austrian, his methodology is overall not.

Andrzej Łaskarz

Andrzej Łaskarz (Laskary) from Gosławic of the Godziemba coat of arms (born in 1362, died in 1426) was Bishop of Poznań from 1414-1426, diplomat, doctor of rights, participant of the Councils, and reformer.
Biography.
His father was Łaszcz z Gosławic from , the Konin castellan - performing the function of a subordinate lądzko-Koniń, and his mother Dorota (probably related to the Poznań bishop Piotr Wysz).
He began his education in Brodnica, then in 1379 he studied at the Charles University in Prague, where before 1392 he obtained the title of a bachelor in the field of decrees, however he graduated in 1393. He then went to the University of Padua, where he obtained the same field in 1405. PhD title.
Already in 1392 he became a provost of Włocławek and held this office until 1414. Also in 1392 he began his diplomatic career by serving the great master of the Teutonic Knights Konrad von Wallenrode. In 1397 he became the chancellor of Queen Jadwiga, and a year later (in 1398) the Włocławek Chapter wanted to be elected a bishop, but Andrzej himself abandoned the throne supported by King Mikolaj Kurowski. Before 1402 he became a canon of Płock, and in 1405 he was the chaplain of the German King Ruprecht Wittelsbach. In 1409 he became a papal collector in Poland and also took part, together with his relatives, the Poznań bishop Piotr Wysz, in the Council in Pisa and pilgrimage to the Holy Land. In 1411, together with Jakub Śledz, he sent John XXIII to the anti pope-John Paul II, complaining to him about the Teutonic Knights breaking the First Peace of Toruń.
His spiritual career was also developing. Already in 1413 he was the dean of Kracow Cathedral, the canon of Gniezno and Poznań. A year later (in 1414) he became a papal protector and bishop of Poznań.
In the meantime, from 1412 to 1414 on behalf of Władysław Jagiełło he appeared as a prosecutor in the trial between Poland and the Teutonic Order and then went as a member of the official Polish delegation to the Council of Constance, where he mainly participated in the work of the commission for faith and in the trials between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. He also became known there as a supporter of church reform and conciliarist. In 1419 he was in the procession of the king during his congress with the emperor in Nowy Sącz, and in 1420 he was in the legation to the Diet of the Reich, which took place in Wrocław, during which the emperor considered Polish-Teutonic disputes. In the same year he took part in a synod called by Mikołaj Trąb to Wieluń. In 1422, he again took part in the trial with the Teutonic Knights, appearing as a witness this time, and in 1423 he took part in the Council in Pavia.

John Dougall (politician)

John Dougall (born April 2, 1966) is an American politician from the state of Utah who has been serving as the Utah State Auditor . A member of the Republican Party, he previously served as a Utah State Representative from 2003 to 2013. Dougall assumed office during the 55th legislative session, replacing David Litvack. Dougall has received bipartisan praise for his accomplishments as state auditor.
Early life and education.
Dougall was born in Hollywood and raised in Portland, Oregon. He graduated from Brigham Young University in 1990 with a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering, and he earned his Master of Science in electrical engineering from BYU the following year. He earned his MBA from BYU in 2000. 
Dougall has worked at various technology companies in Silicon Valley.
Political career.
Dougall was first elected to the Utah House of Representatives in 2002, winning against a crowded field of Republican Party primary opponents. During his 10-year tenure in the House, he sponsored various bills related to transportation, government transparency, and tax reform, including tax cuts in 2006 under governor Jon Huntsman. He also sponsored the controversial HB477, which would have amended the Government Records Access and Management Act to increase restrictions on public access to government documents. The bill was signed into law in March 2011 by governor Gary Herbert, but it was repealed two weeks later after public backlash and harsh criticism from The Salt Lake Tribune. Despite this, Dougall has generally been regarded as an advocate for transparency in the Utah state government.
Dougall was elected Utah State Auditor in 2012, defeating fellow Republican incumbent Auston Johnson. As state auditor, Dougall has led audits that have revealed mismanagement and unethical or illegal behavior at various levels of government in Utah, and some of his investigations have targeted members of his own party.

Basics (Houston Person album)

Basics is an album by saxophonist Houston Person recorded in 1987 and released on the Muse label in 1989.
Reception.
Allmusic reviewer Scott Yanow noted "Tenor saxophonist Houston Person has stuck to his singular musical path throughout his career, playing uncomplicated but soulful and swinging renditions of blues, ballads, and jazz standards for a couple decades, ignoring current (and usually short-lived) musical trends. ... the songs sound brand new and almost as if they were written for him. Recommended".

Colinton War Memorial

Colinton War Memorial is a heritage-listed war memorial at the corner of the D'Aguilar Highway and Emu Creek Road, Colinton, Somerset Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built in 1917. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 15 July 2016.
History.
The Colinton War Memorial (1917), located in road reserve on the southwestern corner of Emu Creek Road and the D'Aguilar Highway at Colinton in the upper Brisbane Valley, is a sandstone and marble memorial to the men of Colinton and district who served during World War I (WWI). This stone memorial board by well-known monumental masons F Williams and Co. is the earliest WWI memorial monument known to be erected in Queensland. It is important in demonstrating Queensland's involvement in a major world event and has a special association with the upper Brisbane Valley community.
The upper Brisbane Valley was settled by squatters in the 1840s and was initially used for depasturing sheep, but later for cattle. Colinton Run, taken up by the Balfour Brothers (John, Charles and Robert) in 1841, included the site of Colinton War Memorial. The original Colinton Station was made up of six leases: Colinton East and West, Mt Stanley East, Mt Stanley West, Diaper and Altyre, comprising covered .
Closer settlement in the Brisbane Valley began in the 1870s. Colinton Run was reduced when the resumption of from Colinton East and West took place in 1876. As a result of land clearance by the selectors in the upper Brisbane Valley, a timber industry flourished, with one of the first sawmills being established at Colinton in the 1870s.
Sufficient settlement of the Brisbane Valley had taken place by 1877 for inspection of the land for a rail route from Walloon, via Esk and Nanango, to Gympie. The first section of the Brisbane Valley railway line, to Lowood, opened on 16 June 1884 while the second section, to Esk, opened on 9 August 1886; where the terminus remained for 17 years. During the 1880s closer settlement of the Brisbane Valley intensified with more land resumed from pastoral stations and settled. Further reduction of Colinton Station took place in 1904 when the Colinton Estate was sold as 145 farms ranging from in size and suitable for dairying and agriculture.
Dairy farming had commenced in the Brisbane Valley in the late 19th century, aided by the advancing Brisbane Valley railway line, which transported farm produce to dairy factories. The first of these was established at Lowood in 1890.
As a result of closer settlement, the township of Colinton formed as a service town for its surrounding agricultural community. In the Queensland Post Office Directory of 1900, three people were listed as residents of Colinton. In 1907 Colinton Provisional School opened nearby in Emu Creek Road, and T H Moore of nearby Colinton Station helped establish the Standard Dairy Company Limited condensery, when he presented the company with its factory site at Colinton.
The Standard Dairy Company became a well-known condensed milk producer in Queensland early in the 20th century and played an important role in the settlement and progress of the Colinton district. It had opened a condensed milk factory at Wyreema on the Darling Downs before 1906. Its second factory opened at Colinton on 15 February 1908, located on the north bank of Emu Creek beside the main road between Kilcoy and Blackbutt. The company stated that "thousands of pounds have been invested in the building and plant [and the condensery was] one of the most complete, largest, and fully equipped in the Commonwealth… capable of treating 10,000 gallons of milk per day". The condensed milk factory made "Prairie" milk from the district's dairy produce. From December 1909, nearby Nurinda railway station loaded goods to and from the factory.
At the outbreak of WWI, Colinton was a growing township. In that year, 27 people were listed there for postal purposes, of which 22 were dairy farmers. The 1911 census for Colinton district had recorded a population of 213. The Standard Dairy Co. Ltd's condensery in the township received the produce of about 44 dairy farmers and provided employment at the factory for at least 40 locals. Photographic evidence of Colinton from 1914 and 1915 shows: about a dozen houses; two stores; and a School of Arts (1911-12), which was located north of Emu Creek, opposite the condensery.
Given its population of a little over 200, Colinton's enlistment response was substantial. By January 1917, 44 Colinton men had successfully enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).
The plan to establish Colinton War Memorial to recognise their war service was initiated in May 1916. "[A] meeting was held to decide in what way to best place on record the excellent response the district has made to the call of the Empire, there having been 46 [sic] good men accepted for service from Colinton and the surrounding district. It has been practically decided to erect a marble slab, bearing the names of those who have volunteered". In August 1916 Joseph H Frisby, secretary of the Colinton Honour Board Committee, was granted permission by the Esk Shire Council to erect an honour board at the Colinton School of Arts, which was the social hub of the town and district, where meetings, dances, balls, and send-offs and memorials for soldiers were held.
On 18 January 1917, the Colinton Honour Board (now known as the Colinton War Memorial) was unveiled by the local member of parliament, Henry Plantagenet Somerset, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. The stone honour board was located directly in front of the Colinton School of Arts, facing north.
Colinton War Memorial is the earliest WWI memorial of the monument type known to have been erected in Queensland. At the time of its unveiling, the memorial was "believed to be the first of its kind in the state". The stone honour board was described as follows:"[t]he base, pillars and crown are of sandstone, the centre being of white marble, on which are inscribed the names of the volunteers."'It is between 10 and 11 feet in height [3-3.3 m], the slab in the centre being marble, and the rest sandstone. The cost was subscribed by the residents of Colinton (Queensland)."No state government other than Victoria's made direct grants for local WWI memorials except for the building of halls, hospitals and schools which were eligible for public money whether or not they were memorials. Fund-raising for local war memorials was thus a voluntary community effort, as was the case at Colinton.
The decision about whose names should appear on a war memorial varied across Australia. While some only listed the dead, many also listed those who returned from service. War memorial committees were also lobbied to consider including people who missed military service for various reasons. In Colinton's case, the memorial was created to honour all the men of their community who volunteered to serve, and they were affectionately called "Our Boys" on the memorial.
WWI memorials took a variety of forms in Australia, including honour boards (from 1915), stone monuments (including obelisks, soldier statues, arches, crosses, columns, urns, or slabs - such as the one at Colinton), tree-lined memorial avenues, memorial parks, and utilitarian structures such as gates, halls and clocks. In Queensland the "digger" statue was the most popular choice of monument, while the obelisk predominated in southern states. Australia's first permanent WWI memorial to honour the men from a particular community was unveiled at Balmain in Sydney, New South Wales on 23 April 1916.
The Colinton War Memorial was designed and executed by Frank Williams, of F Williams and Co. monumental stone masons, of East &amp; Limestone Streets, Ipswich. Frank Williams was a well-known and respected monumental mason whose firm operated from 1901 until 1945. The firm was noted for ecclesiastical marble work and supplied memorials throughout Queensland. It was responsible for about 15 war memorials in southeast Queensland and was also commissioned to create 179 headstones for the graves of WWI soldiers and sailors throughout Queensland. Frank Williams' reputation as a monumental mason was such that well-known sculptor Daphne Mayo learnt the art of carving from him in 1919, prior to travelling to London on Queensland's first traveling art scholarship.
Like all Australian communities, Colinton was affected by the impact of WWI. Of the 330,770 Australians who embarked for overseas service in WWI, 58,961 died and 170,909 were wounded, went missing or became prisoners of war. This meant that around 69% of embarked personnel became casualties - or 21% of eligible Australian males. To date, no previous or subsequent war has had such an impact on Australia in terms of loss of life; almost every community in every Australian state lost young people. Even before the end of hostilities, memorials were being erected by Australian communities to honour local people who had served and/or died. These memorials were a spontaneous and highly visible means of honouring those who served and expressing national grief; substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East.
The Colinton War Memorial lists 43 men who enlisted from the district, although 44 had enlisted. Of these, only 13 returned to Colinton or its adjacent districts at the end of WWI and in 1922 only five of these were still working in the district.
Following WWI, enormous change occurred at Colinton. The Standard Dairy Company Limited announced in December 1919 that its Colinton condensery would be moved to Nerang. However, in August 1920 it was reported as still operating at Colinton. The move was completed by June the following year, when Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Co. (Australia) Ltd was formed to acquire the Australasian business of Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, as well as Bacchus Marsh Concentrated Milk Co. Pty Ltd, the Standard Dairy Co. Ltd (with factories at Wyreema, Wellcamp and Nerang) and Australian Milk Products Ltd. The Nestle Company condensery at Toogoolawah took over the Colinton factory's milk supply.
The closing down of the Colinton condensery impacted upon the township. In 1919-20 there were 37 residents listed for Colinton in the Queensland Post Office Directory. Despite the continuation of dairying as an important industry in the Brisbane Valley, the 1933 census showed a decline in the Colinton district's population to 181.
The decline of dairy farming dates from the 1950s as factories closed and dairymen turned to cattle production. After World War II dairy production in Queensland followed the national shift from cream, butter and cheese production to the supply of pasteurized bulk milk, made possible by improvements to rural roads and in road transportation. Stricter regulations for the running of dairies, lower prices, the loss of the British market, and foreign imports also took their toll. Many farmers either switched to bulk milk production or left the dairy industry altogether.
By the 1950s there were only a few homes and businesses left at Colinton. This decline was no doubt exacerbated by the re-alignment of the Brisbane Valley Highway (now D'Aguilar Highway) in the late 1950s further to the south of that part of the township lying southeast of Emu Creek. By 1971 there were no houses left in the township, although a general store operated beside the re-aligned highway.
Following the 1974 flood - which did not affect the Colinton War Memorial, but did result in upgrading of the adjacent highway - the Esk Shire Council relocated the war memorial from its site near Emu Creek to its current position in the road reserve at the corner of Emu Creek Road and the D'Aguilar Highway.
Today the locality of Colinton has a service station on the southern side of the highway and the Colinton Memorial Park, where the Colinton War Memorial stands. The Colinton area and the neighbouring town of Moore have a combined population of about 315. Colinton War Memorial, although lacking a surrounding township, is the focus of occasional community commemorations and is recognised and visited by passing motorists travelling the adjacent D'Aguilar Highway. It has been the subject of artistic rendition by well-known photographer, Richard Stringer and artist, Lyn Felman.
Description.
The Colinton War Memorial is located within Colinton Memorial Park, a triangular shaped (approx.) area on the corner of D'Aguilar Highway (to the northeast) and Emu Creek Road (to the northwest), at Colinton, in the upper Brisbane Valley. The open park setting contains grassed areas and shade trees of various species, and is bounded to the south by paddocks. Set back from the intersection, the memorial is orientated east-west and faces north.
The memorial stands approximately three metres high and comprises a white marble panel framed by a carved sandstone base, columns and aedicule.
The moulded, stepped base is 'I'-shaped in plan and has bevelled corners. The square columns are stop-chamfered and flank the marble panel, which is visible from two sides. The front of the panel reads "COLINTON HONOUR ROLL" and lists the names of 43 men from the district who served in WWI, in two columns (25 on the left and 18 on the right) roughly in the order they enlisted.
The decorative aedicule has a moulded cornice and is mirrored on the north and south faces. It comprises an arched pediment with the inscription "OUR BOYS" above a laurel wreath set within the tympanum, and a gabled ridge, which is capped with an edge roll and terminates with tracery infills above the columns. The aedicule is topped with an urn that has bevelled corners.
The modern concrete slab, flagpole, metal posts and chains surrounding the memorial are not heritage-listed.

Swidger

Świdger (died 1156) was a semi-legendary bishop of Kruszwice. The chronicle of Jan Długosz indicates that he was a bishop in Kruszwice in 1129-1156. He was buried in the Kruszwick cathedral.
Swidger or Swidgerus is the first historical bishop of Kujawy. He was probably a German from the Norbertine Order.
The only certain reference to his subject is the entry in the obituary of the Benedictine monastery of St. Michał in Bamberg, which may indicate his connection with the mission of Otto of Bamberg.
Jan Długosz in his chronicle ascribes to him the consecration of the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno on March 16, 1133, but there is no consensus on the reliability of this entry. In any case, in the bull of Innocent II from June 4, 1133, is the first reference of the diocese of Kujawy, which allows us to assume that Swidger was actually a bishop of this diocese this year.
The exact date of Swidger's death is unknown. The Bamberg obituary only gives March 10 without an annual date. His successor Warner is certified for the first time on April 4, 1148, in the protection bullave of Eugene III.

Mary Wagner (Canada)

Mary Wagner (born 1974) is a Canadian anti-abortion advocate who has served prison sentences for entering abortion clinics to counsel mothers against abortion without consent of the facility staff.
Biography.
Wagner protested in private abortion clinics in Toronto. She was arrested for the first time in 2012. Following a nearly two-year-long trial, Judge Fergus O'Donnell found her guilty of mischief and probation violation, sentencing her to nine months in prison and two years away from abortion clinics. 
On December 23, 2014, after entering the Bloor West Village Women's Clinic abortion facility in Toronto, Wagner was arrested again and charged with disruption of business operations.
In 2015, Wagner argued in court that violating her probation order by entering an abortion clinic and distributing anti-abortion materials to patients was a necessity to protect the lives of unborn children. This was rejected by the court and upheld on appeal.
In April 2016, Wagner was released from prison after serving a sentence for counselling women at a clinic. On December 12, she was detained inside the abortion center in Bloor West Village, after dissuading one of the women from aborting. She was charged and sentenced to nine months in prison. In August 2017, Telewizja Polska reported that Wagner's mother appealed to Poles to send letters of support to a Canadian judge considering her sentence. In September 2017, Polish right-wingers staged a demonstration in support of Wagner in front of the Canadian Embassy in Warsaw.
Political support.
In 2012, Conservative Member of Parliament Maurice Vellacott presented a Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal to Wagner. Some 60,000 medals were handed out, with each member of Parliament allocated thirty medals to disburse as they saw fit. Vellacott protested the honouring of Henry Morgentaler and hailed Wagner as a "hero of humanity". Interim liberal leader Bob Rae criticised the award as potentially illegal incitement.

Action of 15 February 1918

The action of 15 February 1918 was a naval engagement which occurred during the First World War. The action was fought between an Imperial German destroyer squadron and the lightly armed ships of the Dover Patrol in the Strait of Dover, English Channel.
Background.
By the beginning of 1918 a deep mine barrage across the Dover Strait from Folkestone to Cape Gris Nez, on the French coast was in place. The Germans didn't know of its existence as any U-boats that came across it were destroyed. The minefield worked in combination with a squadron of Royal Navy trawlers who, upon sighting a submarine, would drive it into the minefield by means of gunfire and flares. Between 18 December 1917 and 9 February 1918, five German submarines had been sunk in the minefield. The Germans didn't know about the minefield and thought the Royal Navy ships were sinking the submarines. The Imperial German Naval command decided to send a Destroyer unit to attack the Royal Navy ships.
Action.
British forces in the Channel sighted a submarine around 1:00 AM on 15 February 1918. As drifters attempted to force the submarine into the minefield in the usual manner, they were attacked by a force of German destroyers. The German ships appeared to use one destroyer to illuminate the target with a searchlight long enough for the other ships to get the range at which point the entire group would fire. The German destroyers enjoyed a considerable advantage in firepower over the smaller and scattered enemy craft and moved from one British vessel to the next, destroying each in turn.
In a similar fashion the "Violet May" was attacked and heavily damaged. Two Enginemen, Ewing and Noble, were able to launch a boat and row to safety. When the Germans left, they rowed back and re-boarded their burning ship, treated wounded and brought the fires under control, thus saving their ship. When dawn broke the drifter "Courage" towed them to Dover. The two engineers each were awarded the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal.

Tinea aetherea

Tinea aetherea is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Charles E. Clarke in 1926. However the placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as "Tinea" (s.l.) "aetherea". This species is endemic to New Zealand.
The wingspan is 9–10 mm. The forewings are purplish fuscous with grey-ochreous markings. The hindwings are purplish grey with a dark-fuscous subbasal shade.

Onold (died between 1180 and 1187) - the third bishop of Kujawy. According to tradition (unconfirmed by documents), it was precisely in his time that the seat of the diocese of Kujawy moved from Kruszwica to Włocławek.
It is not known when Onold took over the rule in the Włocławek diocese. He is documented for the first time as a bishopric on 21 May 1161. While his predecessor Warner is known only from the Papal Bull of Eugene III from April 1148. It is also unknown how long Onold held his office. He certainly lived in 1180, when he took part in the synagogue in Łęczyca, where the first immunities for the clergy were passed. His successor Stefan has been documented since 1187.

Aleksandr Babaev

Aleksandr Ivanovich Babaev (; 6 September 1923 22 May 1985) was a Soviet Air Force fighter pilot in the 196th Fighter Aviation Regiment during the Second World War who later went on to become a Colonel-General of Aviation. He was one of the first people to be awarded the Honoured Military Pilot of the USSR medal in 1965 and was later awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1978.
Early life.
Babaev was born on 6 September 1923 to a working-class Russian family in the city of Kaluga of the Russian SFSR. In 1930 the family moved to Voronezh. After graduating from secondary school in 1940 he studied aviation at the Voronezh Aeroclub until he joined the Red Army in December 1940.
Military career.
After enlisting in the Red Army in December 1940, Babaev graduated from the Bataysk Military Aviation School in 1941. From 1941 to April 1942 he served in the 16th and 27th Reserve Aviation Regiments until he was sent to the front of the Second World War.
Upon the German invasion of the Soviet Union, Babaev was deployed as part of the 196th Fighter Aviation Regiment of the 13th Air Army on Leningrad Front. During the war he rose up through the ranks from pilot to senior pilot and link commander until he was promoted to the rank of deputy squadron commander in November 1944. His regiment was later reorganized in September 1944 into the 7th Air Army on the Karelian Front. By the end of the war he held the rank of captain, having made 260 combat sorties on P-40E, R-39, and Yak-1 fighters which involved 48 aerial battles in which he scored nine individual shootdowns and one in a group.
Babaev remained in the military after the war. In 1947 he graduated from the Higher Officers Airborne Tactical Air Force courses in Lipetsk, and in 1948 he returned to the 196th Fighter Aviation Regiment as squadron commander until he was briefly reassigned to the 274th Fighter Regiment in 1950. In 1951 he was reassigned to the 234th Fighter Aviation Regiment where he was the commander until he was assigned to be the deputy commander of the 9th Fighter Aviation division in 1954. After graduating from the Military Academy of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the USSR in 1958 he was put in command of the 126th Fighter Aviation Division of the 16th Air Army in East Germany. From 1963 to 1965 he was the deputy commander of combat training and from 1965 to 1967 he was the First Deputy Commander of the 24th Air Army. From 1967 to 1968 he served as the First Deputy Commander of the 26th Air Army of the Belorussian Military District until he was reassigned from April 1968 to August 1973 as commander of the 76th Air Army of the Leningrad Military District. From then until September 1978 he was commander of the 16th Air Army, during that time he was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for both his service in the Second World War and the training of troops. From September 1978 to April 1980, he was again put in command of the 76th Air Army until it was abolished in 1980. From then to January 1985 he was the commander of the Leningrad Military District Air Force and was a consultant at the S.M. Kirov Military Medical Academy. He passed away on 22 May 1985 and was buried in the Bogoslovskoe Cemetery in St. Petersburg.

Stefan, Bishop of Kujawy

Stefan (died between 1198 and 1206/7?) was chancellor of the prince Kazimierz the Just, and bishop of Kujawy.
Biography.
Stefan's nationality is unknown. Jan Długosz once considers him a Pole, sometimes as a German, while contemporary sources do not give any guidelines to establish this.
Initially, he was to be the provost of the cathedral chapter of Włocławek. During the reunion in Jędrzejów, with the participation of princes and nobles, he appeared as the chancellor of the prince Kazimierz the Just. This congress dates back to the end of 1167 or the beginning of 1168. In Jędrzejów he performed as a chancellor in Wiślica, after Kazimierz became a chancellor of the district in 1173, and from 1177 he was the chancellor of the same prince. It is not known how long he operated on this office, in 1189 sources mention his successor in the person of Chancellor Mrokoty. Prior to this event, Stefan took over the new office.
As a bishop of Kujawy, he is certified for the first time in the document of Kazimierz the Righteous from 1187.
He probably became a bishop in support of the same prince after the death of Bishop Onold (died after 1180). In 1187 he took part in the settlement of the dispute over the chapel in Płock, in 1191 he participated in the dedication of the collegiate church in Sandomierz. He supported the Norbertine monastery in Strzelno with tithing, he gave the nuns a mill in Kwieciszewo in exchange for the village of Otłoczyn. The Oliwa Cistercians gave the right to free burial. Before 1198, he consecrated the church of Saint. Of the Trinity in Lubiszewo and tithed from two villages. In 1198 he consecrated the church in Świecie and had some participation in donations for the benefit of the Knights of St. John in Starogaradzie Gdanski.
Jan Długosz and the cathedral tradition give the erroneous date of the bishop's death on 1197 and the Włocławek cathedral as the place of burial. He died for sure after November 11, 1198 (the date of the consecration in Świecie), and before 1206/7, when his successor Ogierz was documented.

Society for Consciousness Studies

The Society for Consciousness Studies (SCS) is a professional scholarly organization founded in San Francisco. The Society aims to promote a multidisciplinary approach to human and animal consciousness studies. Allan Combs is the founder and president, and founding members of SCS include Combs, Imants Barušs, Julie Mossbridge, Jeffrey A. Martin, Ben Goertzel, Stephen A. Schwartz, Chris Fields, Laurel McCormick, Stanley Krippner, Carolyn Cooke, Frank Echenhofer, Jayne Gackenbach, Eugene Taylor, Etzel Cardeña, Zoran Josipovic, James Clement van Pelt, and Kate Noble.
History.
The SCS began in 2012 as a collaboration among a group of scholars in the nascent field of consciousness studies who were seeking a professionally rigorous but philosophically open forum for communication with each other and for collaborating on research and scholarly projects.
During its first year, the SCS held several informal meetings in the San Francisco area to discuss the teaching of consciousness studies. It held its first full conference in June 2014 in San Francisco at the California Institute of Integral Studies. Fifty talks and were presented at this conference. During subsequent years the ISCS has held yearly conferences alternating between the West Coast in San Francisco and the East Coast at Yale University. Presenters have represented a wide range of research and scholarship, including the original founders of the Society and world-renowned speakers in the field such as Deepak Chopra, Nancy Ellen Abrams, Bernard Baars, and Ervin Laszlo.
The 2019 Conference, "Consciousness and Spirit II", was held at the Graduate Institute (Bethany, Connecticut) and at the []Yale Divinity School]\ (New Haven) May 31-June 2, 2018. The first "Consciousness and Spirit" conference was presented at Yale in 2008 by the Society for the Anthropology of Consciousness.
Membership and Publications.
Over the past three years, membership in the Society for Consciousness Studies has grown to nearly 200 present members, including doctoral students and scholars from Europe, North and South America, Africa, and Asia.
As of 2018, notable members on the Society's board of directors include Combs, Imants Barušs, Deepak Chopra, Ben Goertzel, and Stanley Krippner.
The Society has a two-tiered membership that includes "incidental short reports" on research, scholarship, and application fields that are influenced by consciousness studies.
The Society also is available to publish and review programs and courses on consciousness studies in North America and elsewhere, as well as publishing incidental reviews of important publications.

Albierz

Albierz (Alberus) (died in 1283) was a semi-historic bishop of Włocławek (Kuyavian-Pomeranian).
There is not much information about him. He came from a non-fraternal, probably bourgeois family. The first mentions about him, talk about Albierzu as a chaplain of Michał the Bishop of Włocławek. Around 1250, he became archdeacon. From 1258, he was dean of Włocławek. He became the Bishop of Włocławek in 1275.
The then bishopric of Włocławek also included the area of Gdańsk Pomerania. Hence Albierz took part in the settlement of border disputes between the Pomeranian prince Mściwoj II (Mestwin II) and the Teutonic Knights. At the same time, he assured the Włocławek bishopric of a number of new princely broadcasts in the archdiocese of the Pomeranian bishopric.
The Kujawsko-Pomorskie diocese also had fortunes in the Chełmno land of the Order. Albierz managed to conclude an agreement with the Teutonic Knights on the use of the bishopric of these properties.
Albierz died in December 1283. He was buried in either the Włocławek cathedral or in the Dominican church in Brest Kujawski.

Emily St. John Bouton

Emily St. John Bouton (February 13, 1837 – February 9, 1927) was an American educator, journalist, author and editor.
Bouton was educated for a teacher, and took the highest position awarded to any lady as teacher in high school at Toledo, Ohio and Chicago, Illinois, but resigned them to engage on journalistic work on the Toledo "Blade", which position she held for many years. She also wrote works on health and beauty for women which were published, and one on etiquette, beside pamphlets, all of which won for her an enviable reputation as a writer of books as well as for the newspaper press. She served as editor of the "Household," the "Saturday Salad", and the "Home Talk" columns of the Toledo, Ohio "Daily Blade". She was the author of "Social Etiquette", "Health and Beauty", and other works more or less directly relating to women.
Early years and education.
Emily St. John Bouton was born in New Canaan, Connecticut, February 13, 1837 (or February 15, 1837). Her parents were Daniel Webb and Almina (St. John) Bouton. On her father's side, she traced her ancestry to one of the partisans of William the Conqueror, who was knighted for saving the king when in danger. The family bore a prominent part in the American Revolution among the Connecticut patriots. Her father moved to the West when she was yet a child.
She was educated at Binghamton, New York, and graduated at sixteen in the Sandusky High School as valedictorian in 1857, but had previously taught a primary school in Sandusky, Ohio, when only fourteen years of age.
Career.
After graduating, she became assistant high-school teacher in Milan, Ohio, then in Tiffin, Ohio, and then, for several years, she filled the same position in the Toledo High School. She occupied the chair of English literature in the Chicago central high school for two years, but relinquished her work on account of failing health, going to California for rest and recuperation.
In 1877, she returned to Toledo and became a member of the editorial staff of the Toledo "Blade". To many American households, she was endeared as the "household editor" of the paper. She was also a literary critic, and an "all round" newspaper worker. She did much regular editorial writing in political campaigns in the columns of the paper with which she was connected. Her leaders on political topics were marked by direct and close reasoning, her diction was clear, and her logic was convincing. In her later years, she was not called on so frequently to do that kind of writing, leaving her time free for the, to her, more congenial fields of purely literary work and the management of her own department of the paper. Her special field was in work for women. She was a believer in equal rights for women, and her labors were directed to the advancement of woman's sphere through the personal advancement of every women. Her literary style was so clear and pleasing that it seemed to convey an idea of her personality to her readers. She wrote several successful books on topics pertaining to the home circle. Besides her work upon the Toledo "Blade", she wrote stories, letters and essays for other papers and magazines. Bouton's family circle consisted of her mother, her widowed sister and two nephews.
Bouton worked in societies advocating religious freedom. She was one of the founders and supporters of the Industrial Home for Working Girls, Toledo. She lectured upon literary subjects and their influence upon great movements for humanity’s good. Bouton was a member of the Executive Board of Toledo Suffrage Society. She was the author of "Health and Beauty", "Social Etiquette", "Life's Gateways", and "The Life Joyful". She was a member of the Toledo Woman's Association, Ohio Newspaper Association, honorary member of the Educational Club of Toledo, the Wauseon Woman's Club, Sorosis, and Emerson Class and Writer's Club of Toledo.
She died in Toledo on February 9, 1927.

Tiruvadi Sambasiva Venkataraman

"Rao Bahadur" Sir Tiruvadi Sambasiva Iyer Venkataraman CIE, FNI, FASc (15 June 1884 – 18 January 1963) was an Indian botanist, agronomist and plant geneticist who specialised in the study and hybridisation of sugarcane. He developed or supervised the development of numerous high-yield sugarcane cultivars, which established India as the world's second largest sugar producer and sustained the sugar industries of numerous other nations, including South Africa, Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan, and the United States.
Early life and career.
Venkataraman was born in Salem, Madras Presidency (now in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu) to an orthodox Tamil Brahmin family; though initially religious, he renounced religion by the age of 16. After graduating from a secondary school in Tiruchirapalli, where he was a brilliant scholar, he enrolled at Presidency College, Madras, where he decided to study botany over zoology, as he strongly disliked dissecting insects and other animals. In 1905, he graduated with a first-class honours B.A. in botany and briefly studied for an M.A. at Madras University before his appointment to the Agricultural College, Saidapet (now a constituent college of Tamil Nadu Agricultural University) as an assistant to Charles Alfred Barber, then a botanist in the Madras Presidency government service. In 1908, the college was moved to Coimbatore, where Venkataraman would spend the rest of his career. He soon demonstrated an aptitude for research, attempting to grow hybridised varieties of eggplant in his spare time.
Research and development of the Coimbatore sugarcane cultivars.
In the early 1900s, the extremely poor yields of Indian sugarcane varieties necessitated the import of sugar from the Netherlands East Indies, which was a heavy burden on the government exchequer. The British government eventually decided to establish a Sugarcane Breeding Institute to study sugarcane breeding and to develop an indigenous sugarcane industry. Coimbatore was selected due to its ideal climate, and Barber was appointed Government Sugarcane Expert in October 1912, with Venkataraman as his assistant. According to Venkataraman's biographer and sole graduate student, J. Thuljaram Rao, the two scientists' observation of wild sugarcane ("Saccharum spontaneum") growing near the Agricultural College campus inspired them to use it in their trials.
Though the first hybrid sugarcane crosses between the wild sugarcane and a cultivated sugarcane species, "Saccharum officinarum", did not survive, by 1914, Venkataraman had succeeded in producing viable hybrid seedlings. As sugarcane breeding was a new field of research, Venkataraman relied on meticulous planning and observation along with the pioneering of new techniques, including artificial induction of flowering through photoperiodic treatments, nobilization and outcrossing plants to improve their genetic diversity. He also pioneered the detailed study of sugarcane root systems, which became vital in understanding the plants' yield potentials. In 1918, the first hybrid sugarcane variety produced by the Institute, Co. ("Coimbatore") 205, was recorded as generating yields 50% greater than those of indigenous varieties, which were entirely replaced by Co. 205 within 6–8 years. Along with another variant, Co. 285, the new varieties were soon commercially marketed in the Punjab, where they also proved capable of being cultivated under stressed conditions, including in waterlogged fields. Following those successes, Venkataraman developed a tri-species hybrid by crossing "S. spontaneum" and "S. officinarum" with "Saccharum barberi", a North Indian variety which Barber had researched. The resulting hybrid, Co. 244, became commercially cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Subsequently, tetra-species hybrids were also produced after a fourth parent, "Saccharum robustum", was incorporated into the breeding programme. The hybrid cultivars, with a sugar content nearly 35 times that of their parent stocks, were soon recognised for being fast-maturing, for their ease of propagation and their resistance to waterlogging, drought and the red rot ("Glomerella tucumanensis") and sereh diseases.
In 1918, Venkataraman was promoted to full gazetted rank; he succeeded Barber as head of the Institute the following year, initially in an acting capacity while the British Indian government attempted to locate a European replacement to serve as director. After this proved unsuccessful, Venkataraman was eventually confirmed in his post and served as the permanent head of the Institute until his retirement. Over the next two decades, Venkataraman and his two research assistants, P. Thomas and N.L. Dutt, developed many more hybrid sugarcane varieties suitable for a wide range of environments and climatic conditions. While initial research had focused on developing hardy varieties that could sustain the colder winters in northern India, in 1926 research commenced into breeding plants for the South Indian and similar tropical climates. Apart from the successful Co. 205 and Co 285 cultivars, Co. 213, 421, 427 and 453 became popular in North India, notably in present-day Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, while Co. 419, developed by Dutt, achieved tremendous success across South India and supported the region's sugarcane industries for four decades after its commercial introduction.
In 1927, the Viceroy of India, Lord Irwin, visited the Sugarcane Breeding Institute and praised Venkataraman's work, subsequently ordering all those connected with sugarcane cultivation to pay a visit. In 1928, Venkataraman presided over the agricultural section of that year's Indian Science Congress, delivering a lecture on "The Indian Sugar Bowl." He visited Java the following year to attend the annual meeting of the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists, presiding over the varietal section. In 1932, he was appointed to the Indian Agricultural Service.
By the 1930s, Coimbatore sugarcane cultivars were in high demand and were being successfully grown around the world. In the United States, Co. 281 and Co. 290 supported the sugar industry in Louisiana; Co. 281 also sustained production in South Africa and Cuba as it was readily adaptable and high-yielding even in poor soils and less forgiving climates. Co. 290 achieved popularity in Australia, while the tropical-friendly Co. 419 and Co. 421 became mainstays of sugarcane growers in Barbados, Trinidad and British Guiana (now Guyana). In later years, N. Co. 310, first cultivated in South Africa from seed exported from the Sugarcane Breeding Institute, became the most popular commercially-grown sugarcane cultivar in the world. At one point in the 1960s, Coimbatore-developed varieties were supporting the sugarcane industries of 22 countries. In the 21st century, Coimbatore cultivars continue to be cultivated and used as breeding stocks in Australia, Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan.
Research into intergeneric sugarcane hybrids.
In 1930, Venkataraman successfully developed intergeneric hybrids of sugarcane and sorghum with the objective of producing short-duration sugarcane hybrids. Though the project was ultimately a commercial failure due to issues with sterility, his work subsequently helped inspire Janaki Ammal to develop a sugarcane-maize hybrid. In 1936, he attempted to develop a further intergeneric hybrid of sugarcane and the indigenous "Bambusa arundinacea" bamboo, intended to combine the height of the latter with the sugar percentage of the former. Under controlled conditions, sterile male sugarcane cultivars were used as pistil parents, which were dusted with bamboo pollen. Though some seedlings were produced to much acclaim amongst plant geneticists, with Venkataraman presenting his findings at the 1939 International Genetics Congress in Edinburgh, studies later suggested the seedlings were the result of apomixis, which was less understood at the time. In his researches, however, Venkataraman anticipated the modern development of intergeneric hybrids on a far wider scale.
Later career and life.
Venkataraman was elected President of the 1937 Indian Science Congress, delivering his address on "The Indian Village" and discussing the improvement of villages in the country as a priority: "Our duty then is clear, namely, to improve the village, the nucleus of our country life and inject its chief agent, the villager, with a chosen culture of the virus of [the] modern age through education and industrialisation." He again presided over the agricultural section of the Indian Science Congress in 1938, delivering a lecture on sugarcane hybridisation, and attended the 1939 International Genetics Congress at Edinburgh, where he was recognised as a "wizard" of sugarcane.
Though he was scheduled to retire as head of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute in 1939, Venkataraman obtained a three-year extension and finally retired in 1942, when he was succeeded by his assistant Dutt. The year of his retirement, a "Current Science" article observed "the breeding work carried out by Venkataraman – aided by ample tariff protection – has been responsible for converting India from an importer of white sugar (1 million tons) to a position where the future of the Indian industry is in urgent need of securing export markets." By the end of his tenure at Coimbatore, it was estimated Venkataraman's efforts had saved India roughly 15 crore (150 million) rupees.
Following his retirement, Venkataraman agreed to conduct a survey of sugarcane research in India, but gave it up on health grounds. He subsequently retired to Madras, where he spent his time reading philosophical works and frequently writing letters to "The Hindu" on various subjects. When the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists decided to hold its 1956 conference in India, he chaired the section on cane breeding; during the conference, a plaque commemorating the development of the Co. 205 cultivar was unveiled at the Sugarcane Breeding Institute.
Venkataraman died in Madras on 18 January 1963, aged 78. He was married, and had one son, Ramamurti, who later became an assistant director of the National Physical Laboratory of India.
Awards and honours.
Venkataraman was extensively recognised for his achievements. In 1920, after the commercial success of the Co. 205 cultivar, he was given the title of "Rao Sahib" by the British government, and was raised to the title of "Rao Bahadur" in 1928. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Indian Empire (CIE) in the 1937 New Year Honours list. In the 1942 New Year Honours list, he received a knighthood, becoming the first Indian agricultural scientist to be thus honoured, and was formally invested with his knighthood at the Viceroy's House (now Rashtrapati Bhavan) in New Delhi on 21 February 1942 by the then Viceroy, the Marquess of Linlithgow. In 1956, he was conferred the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government.
Among his other distinctions, Venkataraman was conferred an honorary D.Sc. by Andhra University. In 1941, he was elected the first President of the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding, serving a single one-year term. He was elected as a Fellow of the Indian Academy of Sciences (FASc) in 1934, serving as its Vice-President in 1934–35, and was elected as a Foundation Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences of India (FNI, now the Indian National Science Academy) in 1935. He was also a member of the International Genetics Congress Association, the Indian Society of Genetics and Plant Breeding and the International Society of Sugarcane Technologists, and was an Honorary Fellow of the South African Sugar Technologists Association.

Group-scheme action

In algebraic geometry, an action of a group scheme is a generalization of a group action to a group scheme. Precisely, given a group "S"-scheme "G", a left action of "G" on an "S"-scheme "X" is an "S"-morphism
such that
A right action of "G" on "X is defined analogously. A scheme equipped with a left or right action of a group scheme "G" is called a G"-scheme. An equivariant morphism between "G"-schemes is a morphism of schemes that intertwines the respective "G"-actions.
More generally, one can also consider (at least some special case of) an action of a group functor: viewing "G" as a functor, an action is given as a natural transformation satisfying the conditions analogous to the above. Alternatively, some authors study group action in the language of a groupoid; a group-scheme action is then an example of a groupoid scheme.
Constructs.
The usual constructs for a group action such as orbits generalize to a group-scheme action. Let formula_6 be a given group-scheme action as above.
Problem of constructing a quotient.
Unlike a set-theoretic group action, there is no straightforward way to construct a quotient for a group-scheme action. One exception is the case when the action is free, the case of a principal fiber bundle.
There are several approaches to overcome this difficulty:
Depending on applications, another approach would be to shift the focus away from a space then onto stuff on a space; e.g., topos. So the problem shifts from the classification of orbits to that of equivariant objects.

Joseph Luke Cecchini (born 25 May 1982) is an Italian skeleton racer. He competed in the sport skeleton in the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Cecchini was originally a member of the Canadian skeleton team, but was unlikely to make an Olympic team and so switched to Italy, of which he was eligible for citizenship, as his mother is Italian. Although considered an outside contender initially, an injury to Cecchini's national team teammate prior to the Olympic season paved the way for Cecchini's selection to the Olympic team.

Us and Them (film)

Us and Them (, lit. "The Future Us") is a Taiwanese romantic drama film directed by Taiwanese singer-actress Rene Liu in her directorial debut and produced by Zhang Yibai. The film stars Jing Boran and Zhou Dongyu, and was released on April 28, 2018. The films explores the relationship between a man and a woman who share the same rural hometown and try to find personal and professional fulfillments together in Beijing in the face of economic, social, familial, and romantic adversity.
Plot.
The story is told between the past and the present, the "us" and the "them". The scenes in the past are presented in color while scenes in the present are in black and white.
During the Chunyun period, two strangers, Lin Jianqing and Fang Xiaoxiao, meet on the train while traveling home. They become friends and find out that they are both living in Beijing, trying to find success. Jianqing wants to become a game-maker but has to deal with financial issues as well as lack of time. Xiaoxiao lives with her boyfriend in Beijing, but she leaves him due to an issue with his mother. Xiaoxiao then moves into Jianqing's tiny room in a complex. The two of them make money selling computer software and Japanese porn.
In the present day, Jianqing coincidentally encounters Xiaoxiao during a Chunyun flight. They room together for the night due to a flight delay and reminisce about their relationship. The story then goes back to the past. During Chinese New Year, Jianqing and Xiaoxiao get drunk and have sex, thus beginning their relationship. At the onset, things were good as they both got new jobs. At the next New Years party, Jianqing spends a lot of money to impress his friends back home. The two of them return home during the Chunyun period, and spend time with Jianqing's father. Jianqing's father tells him that he doesn't need to act rich to his friends if he is not.
One day, the manager evicts the couple from the complex. While at work, Jianqing picks a fight with a caller and gets beat up. The couple begins to disconnect as Jianqing becomes increasingly angry and distant, picking fights with strangers and arguing with his father. Xiaoxiao breaks up with Jianqing while he was gaming. When Jianqing notices Xiaoxiao's absence, he runs out and finds her on a subway train. They stand in silence as the train departs. He becomes determined to work finishes his game, which becomes a big hit and lands him a job. Xiaoxiao sees Jianqing on the news where he talks about the inspiration of the game's story and how it ties back to her.
That year, during the Chunyun festival, Jianqing asks Xiaoxiao if she will go together with him to their hometown, which she does. Jianqing's father informs them that he is slowly becoming blind. He refuses to move to Beijing when Jianqing berates the family restaurant and tells him to move to Beijing so that Jianqing can take care of him. Jianqing leaves, with Xiaoxiao following him. On the street, Jianqing asks Xiaoxiao give him a second chance now that he's successful. Xiaoxiao tells Jianqing that she didn't stay with him because she hoped he would get rich and buy her a house, but because she liked him. She tells him that he doesn't understand her and never has, and then leaves.
The story then returns to the present. It is revealed that Xiaoxiao is single whereas Jianqing is married with a child. The two tearfully ask each other if the young love they had years ago was real, and Xiaoxiao admits that she really loved him. She tells him that maybe they were destined to meet on the train home, and maybe they were also destined to not be together. 
Jianqing drives Xiaoxiao home. They hug and formally say their goodbyes. Jianqing tells Xiaoxiao that she will find true love again one day.
While returning home with his wife, Jianqing's father mistakenly calls her Xiaoxiao, to which Jianqing tries to not react. It is later revealed that Jianqing's father was already blind and thought his son had married Xiaoxiao, but quickly realized it wasn't her. He writes Xiaoxiao a final letter, telling her that he wishes she would have ended up with his son, but life doesn't go according to plan. He called Jianqing's wife Xiaoxiao because he wanted Jianqing to marry her so badly. 
After Jianqing's father died, Jianqing goes to the restaurant and reminisces. 
At the end, Xiaoxiao plays through the Jianqing's game, finding the hidden messages for her at the end. Color returns to the present timeline as they reconcile with the past.
Production.
The script was created by Zhang Biyai based on a short story "Home for Chinese New Year". Jing Boran claims to have first read the script "by accident and immediately fell in love with it. Then I met René and we talked about my views on the script and my ideas. We found that we agreed with each other, and therefore I decided to take up the role."
The film was shot in Hailar, one of China's coldest places, in winter 2017. Liu remarked that shooting scenes in minus 40 degrees Celsius weather was painfully cold.
Taihai Publishing released a 288-page book by the director and her thoughts throughout the production, including on-set photography.
Music.
Hong Kong pop singer Eason Chan sang the theme song for the film. The song was composed by Chen Chien-ci and written by Ge Dawei, and the music video was directed by Shen Xiaowei. The music video was released on April 10, 2018, receiving 2 million views in just two hours.
Release.
The film premiered on April 23, 2018 in Beijing.
At the 2018 Cannes Film Festival, Netflix bought exclusive distribution rights to the film everywhere outside of China. The film was released on the service on June 22, 2018. Liu remarked, "I am honored that the film was chosen as Netflix’s first Chinese language original film."
Reception.
Box Office.
Us and Them was a hit in China, earning $191 million over its first two weekends. There was controversy over its $88.8 million May Day weekend opening, and whether ticket sales were inflated through refundable tickets with a rival studio suing over the allegations. Maoyuan, the online ticket sales platform accused of malpractice, attributed the abnormal refunds to high-demand for pre-sale tickets and scalpers. The success of the movie made Liu the first female Chinese filmmaker with a film earning over one billion yuan.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 100% based on reviews from 6 critics. 
It holds a score of 5.9/10 based on 224453 user ratings on Chinese-language Douban and 6.3 on Chinese-language Mtime. Eddie Strait of the Daily Dot remarked that, "[Liu] is a generous storyteller, unafraid to let her characters make mistakes but never vilifying them.". Joe Reid of "Decider.com" described it as "a simple but beautifully filmed love story that touches upon the economic realities of the world [...]" John Berra of "Screen Daily" commented on how, "Liu deftly handles the peaks and troughs of young love, eliciting winning performances from Jing and Zhou." Bhaskar Chattopadhyay of "First Post" highlighted the parental dynamic between Jianqing's father and Xiaoxiao: "It is the sort of writing, the kind of performance that one hopes to see in a film, and it literally saves the film from being just another love story, elevating it to a whole new level altogether." On October 19, 2018, Vulture ranked it as #43 in its list of "Every Netflix Original Movie, Ranked".

Anthony Watson (skeleton racer)

Anthony Watson (born 2 November 1989) is an American-born skeleton racer who competed on behalf of Jamaica in the 2018 Winter Olympics, becoming the first athlete to represent the Caribbean nation in the winter sport.
Biography.
Born and raised in Vineland, New Jersey, he is the son of Basil and Gloria Watson. Watson attended Cumberland Christian School, from which he graduated in 2008. He attended Roberts Wesleyan College before transferring to the University of the Arts in Philadelphia and had competed in track in the 100m, 200m and the 4x100m relay at the junior level until an injury prevented him from advancing to the top levels of competition in track and field. 
Watson found the United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation after checking out the tryout pages for every sport in which the United States was represented in international competition and chose skeleton after seeing a series of videos. An aspiring Olympian from the time he was a child, Watson participated for three years in the American training program for bobsled and skeleton, but "left on peaceful terms". Given that his father had been born in Jamaica, Watson was eligible to compete on behalf of his father's native country. Ranked 79th in the world based on his competition results, his qualification standards with the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation were not sufficient for him to be eligible to receive one of the 30 guaranteed berths granted for male competitors to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, but Watson was given the final slot to represent Jamaica after nations with individuals who had better times turned down spots, making him the first athlete from Jamaica to compete in skeleton.
With finishing times of 53.13, 54.04 and 53.35 seconds in the Olympic skeleton competition, Watson finished in 29th place in each of the three first heats. His top speed was , reached during the first heat. His total time in the three heats of 2:40.52 meant that he did not qualify for the final race; he placed him almost 10 seconds behind Yun Sung-bin of South Korea, who went on to win the gold medal.

George Dury

Friedrich Julius Georg Dury (1817–1894) was a well-regarded portrait artist who worked in both oil and pastel. Born in Würzburg, Bavaria, he emigrated to the United States in 1849, and became a bespoke gallery artist in Nashville, Tennessee. 
An 1870 review said Dury was an artist "who has caught his inspiration from the old masters". Dury typically did not sign his paintings. Dury's work is on display in the US White House, the Cheekwood Botanical Garden and Museum of Art and the Tennessee State Museum.
Early life and education.
George Dury was born in Würzburg in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1817, the first of Nicholas and Augusta (née Lommler) Dury's three children. Showing early talent, Dury was admitted as a student at the age of 13 at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich (Akademie der Bildenden Künste München) in Munich. He graduated eight years later at the age of 21. 
Early artistic acclaim.
While a student at the Academy of Fine Arts, Dury developed a technique of using encaustic painting that closely resembled the then highly popular portraiture on ivory. Miniature paintings on ivory are particularly vulnerable due to fading from sunlight and ivory's ability to absorb contaminants. Dury's novel technique was hailed as "widely superior to ivory pictures and even more durable than oil-paintings". 
Using his new technique, Dury became known for his talent in painting small cabinet portraits, including his paintings of Prince Adalbert of Bavaria and Queen Consort Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen. 
Early European career.
King Ludwig I of Bavaria, became Dury's patron, hiring Dury as court painter and charged Dury to paint Ludwig I's Irish-born mistress Eliza Gilbert (better known by her stage name Lola Montez). Dury brought a copy of the painting of Gilbert with him when he emigrated to the US. Dury also painted a miniature of Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia.
Later career in America.
Dury emigrated to the United States in 1849, with his 19-year old fiancée Katherine Schaeffer, his sister Josephine and her fiancé Augustin Gattinger. Both couples were married April 24, 1849 at the American consulate in Le Havre, France before sailing to America.
Arriving in New York City, they took a train to the "end of the line", Dalton, Georgia and a stagecoach from there to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where Dury first settled in Wartburg, Morgan County, Tennessee, and quickly relocated to Nashville, Tennessee in 1850. Initially Dury taught oil painting at the Nashville Female Academy. Dury also set up a second story studio at No. 43 Union Street, accepting commissions as a portrait artist.
US Civil War disruption.
Dury lost his job teaching at the Nashville Female Academy when it closed at the beginning of the US Civil War.
The Dury family home was often a target for Union soldiers who occupied Nashville for three years. Soldiers "regularly raided the kitchen - stripping hot bread from the oven and taking milk from the children". The Union army billeted soldiers in the Dury home where one soldier died of typhoid fever in Mrs. Dury's arms, thinking she was his mother.
Nevertheless, Dury continued to paint portraits of both Union and Confederate officers during the Civil War, including Gen. Robert E. Lee. It is thought Dury painted the portrait from a sculpture Dury made of Lee. The Lee portrait is in a private collection in Virginia. A smaller copy painted by Dury hangs in Lee's Washington D.C. home "Arlington".
State of Tennessee commission.
In May, 1866, the Tennessee state legislature passed a resolution to pay Dury a $ 1,000 commission for a portrait of Gen. George H. Thomas, commander of Union forces during the Battle of Nashville. The state legislature later commissioned Dury to paint portraits of presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson.
Nashville's "Academy of Fine Arts".
In 1872, Dury met with professional "artists and amateurs" in the studio of artist Robert Loftin Newman, where he joined fellow artists who were trying "to establish an Academy of Fine Arts for the purpose of... advancing the cause of art in our midst" in Nashville. Dury was elected vice-president during the meeting. Plans were discussed to purchase and display copies of important European works of art, including statues and paintings.
List of Dury portrait subjects.
Many Dury's early and most important portraits were donated to the Tennessee State Museum by his grandson Robert Dury of Melbourne Beach, Florida. Dury's portraits of William Walker and Lola Montez are in the Tennessee State Museum. He also painted James D. Porter, Robert Armstrong, William Gannaway Brownlow, Andrew Johnson, Queen Consort Therese of Saxe-Hildburghausen, and William Brimage Bate. A portrait of Randal William McGavock is also attributed to him.
Dury portraits of Sarah Childress Polk.
In 1878, during a conversation in Dansville, New York, it was noted the White House did not have a portrait of President Polk's wife Sarah Childress Polk. Frances Willard, national president of Woman's Christian Temperance Union, created a committee, empowering it to commission Dury to paint a life portrait of Mrs. Polk who was seventy-five years old when she sat for the artist.
Dury completed another portrait of Sarah Childress Polk in 1883, 34 years after President Polk's term ended. Dury modeled his oil on canvas portrait after George P. A. Healy's 1846 portrait of Mrs. Polk. Dury's painting hangs in the East Wing of the White House.
Death and burial.
Dury died of "old age", December 2, 1894 at the home of his daughter Augusta Brengelman at 711 Russell Street in Nashville, Tennessee. His body was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

The Nintendo Entertainment System controller is an oblong brick-like design with a simple four button layout. It consists of two round buttons labeled "A" and "B", a "START" button, and a "SELECT" button. Additionally, the controllers utilized the cross-shaped joypad, designed to replace bulkier joysticks used in earlier gaming consoles’ controllers. The NES controller could also be unplugged as the NES featured two custom 7-pin ports on the front of the console.
Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
The controller used for the SNES introduces two face buttons X and Y. The four face buttons on the right side are arranged in a diamond shape. Two shoulder buttons are also added and is more ergonomic over the NES controller. The controller was designed by Lance Barr. The Japanese and PAL region versions incorporate the colors of the four action buttons into the system's logo. The North American version's buttons are colored as follows: the X and Y buttons are lavender with concave faces, and the A and B buttons are purple with convex faces. Several later consoles derive elements of their controller design from the SNES, including the PlayStation, Dreamcast, Xbox, and Wii Classic Controller.
Virtual Boy.
The controller for the Virtual Boy has 4 surface buttons: select, start, B, and A. The face also includes dual directional-pads meant to be used for controlling games in a 3D space. Finally, two small shoulder buttons are placed on the back of the controller's grips and the system's power button is placed in the center of the controller. The Virtual Boy system is powered by 6 AA-batteries held in the battery pack on the controller or by an AC power adapter which also connects to the back of the controller. Additionally, the power cable used in the power adapter is the same power cable and power supply used for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. While the Virtual Boy controller differs greatly in design from Nintendo's other controllers, the directional pads closely resemble the directional pad of the Game Boy but larger and with a steeper slope inwards. Since the Virtual Boy was designed for single player use, the system only has a single controller port on the underside of the console. Due to this single port, the Virtual Boy only ever sold with one controller per unit.
Nintendo 64.
The Nintendo 64 controller is Nintendo's fifth generation controller and features ten buttons, an analog control stick, and a directional pad. The controller is in the shape of an "M", and was designed to be held in three different positions. First, it can be held by the two outer grips, allowing use of the D-pad, right-hand face buttons and the "L" and "R" shoulder buttons (but not the "Z" trigger or analog stick). It can be also held by the center and right-hand grip, allowing the use of the single control stick, the right-hand buttons, the "R" shoulder button, and the "Z" trigger on the rear (but not the "L" shoulder button or D-pad). Finally, the controller can be held by the center and left-hand grip, allowing for a combination of the D-pad, L-shoulder, analog stick and Z button (but not the "R" shoulder button or right-hand buttons).
The design is versatile, but it is also controversial because a player is unable to access all the buttons with the player's hands in any one position. Accessing all buttons would require the player to switch hand positions. The controller also includes four "C buttons" on the top, which were originally intended to control the camera in the N64's three-dimensional environments. However, since the pad only contains three other face buttons, the C-buttons often became assigned to ulterior functions.
GameCube.
The GameCube controller is Nintendo's sixth generation controller, released along with the GameCube in 2001. The standard GameCube controller has a wing grip design and features a total of six digital buttons, two analog sticks, a d-pad and two hybrid analog triggers/digital buttons.
The primary analog stick is on the left, with the D-pad below it. The four main face buttons are to the right of the controller. The face buttons include a large green "A" button in the center, a smaller red "B" button to its bottom left and the kidney-shaped "X" and "Y" buttons to the right and top of the "A" button, respectively. There is also a yellow "C" stick below the main face buttons. A Start/Pause button is located in the middle of the controller. On the shoulders of the controller there are two analog triggers marked "L" and "R," as well as a "Z" button above the "R" trigger.
The standard GameCube controller provides haptic feedback by way of a built-in rumble motor rather than using an external Rumble Pak add-on like the Nintendo 64 controller.
Wii.
The Wii Remote ditches the traditional gamepad controllers of previous gaming consoles for a one-handed remote control-based design. This was done to make motion sensitivity more intuitive, as a remote design is more optimal for pointing. Another goal with this design was to help the Wii appeal to a broader, non-gamer audience. The body of the Wii Remote measures long, wide, and thick. The controller communicates wirelessly with the console via short-range Bluetooth radio, with which it is possible to operate up to four controllers as far as 10 meters (approx. 30 ft) away from the console. However, to utilize pointer functionality, the Wii Remote must be used within five meters (approx. 16 ft) of the Sensor Bar. The controller's symmetrical design allows it to be used in either hand. The Wii Remote can also be turned horizontally and used like a Famicom/NES controller or steering wheel.
The Wii Remote has a large "A" button in the front, and a curved "B" button in the back resembling a trigger. Under the "A" button is a plus and minus, and at the bottom of the remote is a "1" and "2" buttons. In the middle of the Wii Remote, between the plus and minus button is a small "home" button that resembling a home/house. There are also blue LEDs indicating player number that are labeled using small Braille-like raised dots instead of Arabic numerals, with "1" being "•", "2" being "••", "3" being "•••", and "4" being "••••".
The blue LEDs also show how much battery power remains on the Wii Remote. By pressing any button, besides the power button while the controller is not being used to play games, a certain number of the four blue LEDs will light up, showing the battery life: four of the LEDs flash when it is at, or near, full power. Three lights flash when it is at 75%, two lights when at 50%, and one light flashes when there is 25% or less power remaining.
The Wii Remote also features an expansion port at the bottom which allows various functional attachments to be added. The most popular attachment are the Wii Nunchuk and Classic Controller. The nunchuk connects to the Wii Remote via a cord that is about long. It features an analog stick similar to the one found on the GameCube controller and two trigger buttons(oval-shaped "C" and rectangle-shaped "Z") and works in tandem with the main controller in many games(including Mario Kart Wii). The Classic Controller, which plugs into the expansion port, emulates the basic design of the SNES controller. It is designed for use with the virtual console, but is also compatible with many standard Wii games.
Wii U.
The Wii U GamePad is the standard controller for Nintendo's eighth generation video game console. It incorporates traits from tablet computers and also has traditional input methods, such as buttons, dual analog sticks, and a D-pad. It also features touchscreen and motion controls. The touchscreen can be used to supplement a game by providing second screen functionality or an asymmetric view of a scenario in a game. The screen can also be used to play a game strictly on the GamePad screen, without the use of a television display. Conversely, non-gaming functions can be assigned to it as well, such as using it as a television remote.
There is also a Wii U Pro Controller.
Nintendo Switch.
The Joy-Con are the primary controller(s) of the Nintendo Switch video game console. They consist of two individual units, each containing an analog stick and an array of buttons. They can be used while attached to the main Nintendo Switch console unit, or detached and used wirelessly. When detached, a pair of Joy-Con can be used by a single player, or divided between two as individual controllers. When the Joy-Con are removed from the console, two shoulder buttons, SL and SR, are revealed on the inner side of the railing. Notably, there is some controversy surrounding the quality of the joysticks used on the Joy-Con. Specifically, after extended use the joysticks often cease to sense certain directional inputs or sense directional inputs when none are given. This problem is colloquially known as Joy-Con drift.
There is also a Nintendo Switch Pro Controller, Poké Ball Plus controller made for and Pokémon Sword and Shield, and a Nintendo Switch GameCube Controller made for Super Smash Brothers Ultimate and Super Mario 3D All-Stars.

West's Furniture Showroom

West's Furniture Showroom is a heritage-listed former shop at 620 Wickham Street, Fortitude Valley, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Karl Langer and built from 1952 to 1953. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015.
History.
The former West's Furniture Showroom, completed in early 1953, was commissioned by Laurence (Laurie) West (1918–2013) as a modernist purpose-designed furniture showroom. Located at the northeast end of Fortitude Valley, one of Brisbane's busiest shopping centres at the time, it was designed by architect Dr Karl Langer (1903–1969) to attract attention and provide a setting for West's modern furniture. As the only Australian business licensed to make and sell Knoll furniture between 1956 and 1962, West's Furniture Showroom supplied architects with modern furniture for their buildings, and promoted Modern design both within the design community and to the general public. Sold by the West family in 1964, the building had several owners until its purchase by architect Robert Riddel, who in 2008 instigated and managed restoration and reconstruction works.
Fortitude Valley, located on the north side of the Brisbane central business district (CBD), developed over several stages to become one of Brisbane's most successful shopping centres, concentrated in Ann, Brunswick and Wickham Streets. A major building boom took place there in the 1880s, reflecting the widespread economic and population growth typical of the decade. Old timber buildings were replaced with larger, more impressive buildings, marking the growing sophistication, confidence and population of the suburb. Access was improved by the introduction of public transport in the form of horse-drawn trams (replaced by Brisbane's electric trams in the 1890s). By the close of the 1880s the Valley (as Fortitude Valley is often called by Brisbane residents) had become intensively settled and was beginning to grow rapidly as a secondary retail centre to the city centre. In 1891 the train line from the city was extended to Fortitude Valley, fuelling the growth of industry in the area, with large factories and warehouses established beyond the retail centre, close to workers' dwellings.
It was during the 1880s and 1890s that three major retailers were established in the Valley – Overell's drapery (est. 1883), TC Beirne's drapery (est. 1891), and McWhirters (est. 1898) – whose ongoing expansion reflected the wealth and optimism of Valley retailers, and attracted further activity and capital to the area.
Another building boom took place throughout Brisbane in the 1920s; and the Valley in particular, with its success as a commercial and industrial hub, expanded even further. Connection to the city was improved, and electric trams, which passed the busy corner of Brunswick and Wickham Streets, brought thousands of shoppers to the Valley. In 1949, the year that Fortitude Valley celebrated its centenary of European settlement, the turnover of Valley retailers alone was estimated at £15 million each year, of which the three biggest firms, McWhirters, T C Beirne and Overells, accounted for more than a third.
In the early 1950s the Valley underwent a facelift, with investment of more than £1 million in expanding and modernising buildings in order to compete with "uptown" Queen Street, bringing a "modern slickness" to the area. Old shopfronts were replaced with stainless steel and plate glass, dozens of shops were renovated inside and out, and larger stores were constructed, with new features such as escalators proving very popular with customers. Unlike Queen Street, the Valley had ample room for expansion and plenty of parking space, making it a desirable location for a "shopping centre of the future".
In addition to the major stores, the Valley was home to hundreds of medium and small-scale businesses, including numerous furniture manufacturers and retailers. In the post-World War II (WWII) period, a growing percentage of goods sold in the Valley were coming from factories in close proximity to the main shopping centre, including printing, textiles, timber, domestic machinery, motor car assembly, hardware and furniture factories. Fortitude Valley was one of the main hubs for furniture retailers in Brisbane, along with Woolloongabba, South Brisbane and the CBD. The 1951–52 Brisbane Metropolitan Trade and Business Directory lists 18 "furnishers and furniture dealers" in the Valley, most concentrated at the southwest end of Wickham Street. The types of retailers ranged from the large department stores, to shops selling mass-produced furniture at affordable prices, to more specialist retailers who designed and/or made furniture to order.
The most important feature of furniture shops were their showrooms: large, flexible spaces where the furniture was displayed, often in room-like configurations so that customers could visualise the furniture in their own homes. Most furniture showrooms at that time were housed within a variety of commercial or warehouse-type buildings; many in older buildings adapted for display purposes. Showrooms also ranged in size, from single-storey shops to multi-storey complexes of adjoining buildings.
One of the Fortitude Valley furniture businesses was West's Furniture Emporium (West's) at 132–134 Wickham Street, established in 1937 by Frank Presnell West (father of Laurence West). Frank West had purchased the property in 1922 and in 1927–28 a 4-storey building was constructed on the site for Crafti &amp; Co. Ltd, well known furniture retailers. After Crafti &amp; Co. experienced financial difficulties in the mid-1930s and moved out, the building was occupied by West's. Advertisements from the 1930s and 40s show that West's sold a wide variety of furniture, in both "period" and "modern" styles, and their motto was "West's for the Best". Promoting themselves as a small family concern, their furniture was made in a chain of small factories, each specialising in varied classes of furniture.
By the early 1950s, Frank West's son Laurence (Laurie) West had joined the family furniture business. Born in 1918, Laurie became well known in musical circles as a fine baritone singer, and performed in many concerts and singing competitions as a young man in the 1930s and 40s. During WWII he served in the Australian army, attaining the rank of sergeant. After his discharge in April 1946, he and his wife Mary (née Quine, married in 1943) moved into their new, architect-designed residence at Fairfield. While still active in performing and musical circles, Laurie spent a short time studying architecture at the Brisbane Central Technical College. During his studies, Laurie was struck by the lack of local consideration given to the "world scene," especially in terms of interior design. Extending his own knowledge of this field through "extensive reading in libraries and [of] purchased books" – including subscriptions to journals from America, Sweden and Europe – and contact with like-minded individuals, including the architect Karl Langer in Brisbane and Harry Seidler in Sydney, Laurie developed a desire to supply Brisbane (and Australia) with modern furniture. This desire grew in ambition and scale, and in the early 1950s he began planning a new purpose-designed showroom for displaying and selling modern furniture.
The site chosen for the new showroom was at the northeast edge of Fortitude Valley, in a predominantly residential and industrial area. Frank West sold his property at 132–134 Wickham St in 1951 and in the same year purchased 618 Wickham Street (now known as 620 Wickham Street). At the time, the property consisted of an old timber residence with a shop at the front, and had rear access from Knapp Street. In 1951, Laurie West himself drew up some concept plans for a modern showroom on the site, which included a fish pond inside the front display window, a side arcade and entrance, an open-plan showroom with regularly-spaced posts painted bright primary colours, and a flat roof with rooftop garden.
The architect engaged to design West's new furniture showroom was Dr Karl Langer, who had designed Laurie and Mary West's house at Fairfield. Born and educated in Vienna, Langer immigrated to Australia with his wife, artist and art critic Dr Gertrude Langer, in 1939; bringing direct experience of the European Modern Movement to Queensland. In addition to working as an architect, Langer lectured part-time in architecture and architectural design at the University of Queensland from 1940, publishing his influential booklet "Sub-Tropical Housing" in 1944. From 1945 Langer was employed as an assistant town planner by Brisbane City Council and was also commissioned to work on a range of town planning projects around Australia. Concurrently, he completed a wide variety of architectural projects ranging from small, economical domestic work to large commercial and institutional work.
Langer had a pronounced impact upon the built environment of Australia and set new standards for design in Queensland until his death in 1969. His body of work is a clearly-distinguishable exploration of a sub-tropical Modernism and is important in the evolution of Queensland architecture. Langer's designs were typified by modern, highly-functional spaces lit by high levels of natural daylight, naturally ventilated, and incorporated gardens and water features for the occupation and enjoyment of users. They were fit for purpose, while having a degree of flexibility of use. Other important examples of Langer's architectural work include: Langer's residence at St Lucia (1950); the Sugar Research Institute at Mackay (1953); St John's Lutheran Church at Bundaberg (1960); St Peter's Lutheran College Chapel at Indooroopilly (1968); and the former Department of Main Roads Building at Spring Hill (1967).
Langer's design for the new West's showroom comprised a modern display area at the front of the site, with a workshop at the rear housed in the existing residence. This followed the pattern of a new type of small, combined showroom/industrial building which emerged in Queensland in the 1950s. Located in inner city areas on small sites, and built up to the street alignment to match adjacent buildings, these showrooms were usually a single structure of two to three storeys, with large expanses of glazing to the front elevation acting as showcases. They had a clear division between public and private space, with the ground floor area fronting the street housing display and administration areas, while production and storage areas were located to the rear or on upper levels. Detailed attention was given to the design of entry ways, as access to the building was directly off the footpath; and features such as controlled illumination levels, climatic control features and sheltered street frontages reflected a sense of responsibility to the public to provide a comfortable environment.
Completed in early 1953, West's Furniture Showroom was "designed with the utmost economy in the contemporary manner". The showroom comprised a rectangular space with a cantilevered, upswept awning that extended over the Wickham Street footpath. The building was predominantly of masonry construction, with a glass shopfront, a concrete floor, and a shallow-pitched, asbestos- and bitumen-lined roof constructed from timber trusses. The roof-top was used as garden area for displaying outdoor furniture and some furniture assembly operations. The existing timber residence was relocated to the rear of the site and converted for use as a workshop for the assemblage and storage of furniture. The workshop enabled access to the roof-top display area, and was level with Knapp Street for the loading of goods to transport vehicles. Its ground floor consisted of a woodwork shop, and the upper floor was designated for polishing and inventory storage. Public access to the showroom was through a single timber door at the northeast end of the Wickham Street shopfront, adjacent to a random rubble stone wall. Projecting from the angled shopfront, the door frame was supported by glass, so that it appeared to float.
As the furniture showroom was located on the edge of the Fortitude Valley shopping area, the shopfront was designed to be dramatic and striking, to catch the attention of potential customers. Supported by timber beams, three floor-to-ceiling windows, measuring high by wide, angled in toward the interior at 60 degrees. They were designed to eliminate the reflections of traffic, adjacent buildings and the sky onto footpath pedestrians; while simultaneously attracting the eye of passing traffic by catching reflections of the sky. Along the southwest side of the building, vertical plate glass walls returned into the site and created a pedestrian arcade. This arcade, combined with the absence of a building at the front of the adjacent property, meant that West's furniture collection was noticeably visible when approached from the city and the potential customer had a clear view of the showroom. A concrete-edged, serpentine fish pond meandered around the base of the angled windows and glass return. Supported below the water-line by concrete pads with rubber cushions, the glass appeared to float atop the pond. The pond was decorated with water-plants and fish; and, through its half-interior, half-exterior location, it conveyed the notion of easy access to the furniture inside.
The interior of the showroom comprised a large open space, with a steep set of concrete stairs in the centre of the rear wall through which furniture was transported from the workshop. Hardwood timber columns supported the ceiling – five of which stood in a row, exposed within the showroom and just outside the shopfront. The columns were supported on metal pin-joints, and their timber was crafted to hide cables that led to power outlets at their base. A 1953 article in the publication Architecture Building Engineering explains that there were no fixed partitions or obstructions within the showroom to allow complete flexibility in arranging the displays. Aquariums were planned to flank the rear staircase, set within the rear wall, although it is unclear whether these were ever constructed (new windows line the rear wall in 2015, of similar proportions to those shown in a 1952 plan). Despite the length of the showroom, it was designed to be lit by natural light during the day by three large, rectangular light-wells (featuring a curved southwest edge, and running the length of the showroom), as well as three oval-shaped ventilator-skylights (arranged parallel to the shopfront windows). Both the light-wells and the skylights were covered by corrugated, transparent plastic roofing. The deep roof trusses were designed to ventilate the ceiling space, and Laurence West recalls that the showroom was kept cool by air movement in the large space above the curved plaster ceiling (within the rectangular light-wells).
Construction work for West's Furniture Showroom was carried out by Ajax Builders (concrete and brick works), H Packman (timber), and G McKinnon (skylights and fibrous plaster, ceiling work). West's completed the timber joinery themselves. Installation of the glass within the sloping display windows proved to be a technical challenge. Ten men were required to ease each of the three panes out of their frames and into position, and two panes were broken in the process.
Both the design and function of the showroom demonstrated the shifting tastes and values of post-war Queensland and the strong desire within the design community and beyond to move the state towards new and modern ways of living. Modernist architecture, which developed in pre-World War I Europe and gained popularity in Australia after WWII, was notable for rationalised planning and simplicity of form and detailing. Distinguished by their extensive use of steel, reinforced concrete and glass, Australian buildings in the Modern or "International" style were heavily influenced by American and European examples. Characteristics included sleek, glossy, prismatic forms, cubiform shapes clad with curtain walls and selective expression of structural systems.
Sharing the ideals of the Modernist movement, both international and Australian furniture designers of the mid-20th century sought to revolutionise the contemporary interior. Mid-century modern furniture turned away from traditional, ornate and "over-stuffed" designs that had previously been fashionable, and instead opted for pieces that were lightweight, practical, comfortable, easily rearranged, and scaled to fit within post-war houses. A 1954 article in "Home Beautiful" advocated that Modern furniture met the needs of the day and rejected the use of ornamentation. Modern furniture was designed to be pared-back and sculptural, and was ideally suited to Modernist architecture.
Influenced by international furniture trends, Australian contemporary furniture designers of the post-war period also promoted a philosophy of innovative "good design" that was both functional and beautiful. An influx of European immigrants introduced specialised skills and knowledge in fine furniture making to Australia; and production techniques developed in war-time manufacturing industries encouraged experimentation in furniture design. Post-war furniture designers, both in Australia and internationally, became innovative in their use of materials, due to an increased availability of some materials and a shortage of others. This experimentation led to the use of unconventional materials in furniture design, such as: curved plastics, fibreglass and aluminium; bent and laminated plywood; spot welding that joined timber to metal, rubber and plastics; sleek and narrow steel rods; cast aluminium; polyester resins; acrylics; and foam rubber. These materials were durable, lightweight and maintenance-free, reducing the burden on everyday living.&lt; They were manipulated to create minimalist, clean lines and, following the Bauhaus principle of "form follows function", framing elements were often showcased.
When the new West's Furniture Showroom began operating in 1953 it stocked a wide variety of high-quality, designer Modern furniture, including those from prominent Australian designers: Douglas Snelling (architect, designer of the "Snelling Line", which utilised parachute webbing), Clement Meadmore (industrial designer and sculptor, known for his simple and economical designs that used readily-available materials) and Grant Featherston (designer of the "Contour" line that used bent plywood, which was moulded to the human form). The work of these designers was heavily featured in home-decorating magazines throughout the 1950s.
As well as stocking Australian designers, West's was the first known retailer in Australia to obtain the licence to manufacture and sell the furniture of Knoll Associates (1938–present). Established by Hans Knoll (1914–1955) in New York as the Hans G Knoll Furniture Company, the first Knoll furniture manufacturing plant was opened in Pennsylvania, USA, in 1941. Florence Schust (1917– ), a space planner and designer who had befriended and studied under prominent Modernist architects Eliel Saarinen, Charles Eames, Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer, was employed by Knoll in 1943. In 1946 Hans and Florence married, and the company changed its name to Knoll Associates. A wide range of prominent architects, designers and artists were engaged to design furniture for their company, including Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Harry Bertoia, Eero Saarinen, Jens Risom and Marcel Breuer. Influenced by Bauhaus ideals, their furniture was technologically innovative, exceptionally designed, made of high-quality materials and easily mass-produced.
In 1946, Florence established the Knoll Planning Unit – a department which designed interior spaces for corporate clients – and later designed Knoll showrooms to allow the customer to experience their furniture and test potential purchases. The showrooms were distinctively modern, open-planned and generally featured bright interiors of primary colours. The first Knoll showroom opened in New York in 1951 with a coloured ceiling grid, artificial pond, and open layout that allowed for a changing layout of products. As Knoll Associates continued to expand, showrooms were opened in eight other locations throughout America. A subsidiary of the company, Knoll International, was established in 1951 and set about opening Modernist showrooms around the globe in places such as Paris, Stuttgart, Stockholm, Madrid, and Milan. A index released by Knoll Associates lists West's as the only retailer with a licence to sell genuine Knoll furniture in Australia, and as one of only 13 stores selling Knoll furniture outside of America. West's remained the only known licensed manufacturer and retailer of Knoll products in Australia until William Latchford and Sons, a Melbourne firm, obtained a licence in 1962.
Following its opening, West's was featured in various periodicals, including a 1953 Cross Section article, a 1954 issue of Architecture (the Royal Australian Institute of Architect's journal), and on the front cover of Queensland publication Architecture Building Engineering. The showroom was radically different to any other retail building in Brisbane at the time. It was described as having a striking street presence and its planning embraced unique solutions to display problems. Accounts from the West family recall the building being so eye-catching that tourist buses would regularly stop outside, and that Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh briefly stopped the Royal Cavalcade to view the building during the Queen's visit in 1954. A few years later, the Queensland Art Gallery showcased furniture from the showroom in their contemporary living room display in the 1958 exhibition, "Interiors Past and Present".
West's was "...instrumental in introducing mass-market designer furniture into Brisbane", and sold high-quality furniture not available elsewhere in Australia to a range of prominent architects and well-known personalities. Notable clients included: architects Harry Seidler, Robin Gibson, James Birrell (for the Chermside and Annerley Libraries), Karl Langer (Broadbeach Hotel) and David Bell (Chevron Hotel); interior designer Langdon Badger; federal politician Harold Holt; and institutions including the Queensland Government, the Canadian Embassy, and the University of Queensland (Student Union Building). At the time, licensing restricted imports to a few sample pieces of furniture, so West's organised a large group of skilled sub-contractors to make parts, which were assembled at the showroom workshop. High quality Australian wools and yarns were used to upholster the furniture made, including those from Ipswich manufacturer, Morrisons.
West's operated from the building until the business closed in November 1963. This was due to a variety of factors, including the loss of its exclusive licence with Knoll in 1962. In 1964 the property was sold to Arthur Walter Barrs, who owned the adjacent building (then 620 Wickham Street, now 622 Wickham Street) from which he ran a car radio business. The former West's showroom remained in the ownership of the Barrs family until the late 1970s, and was at one point leased to Philips Industries Holdings, an electrical products company. Between and 2008, Queensland Used Appliances, now Queensland Appliances, occupied the building (listing their address as 616 Wickham Street).
Over time, the Wickham Street facade of the showroom was converted into a more conventional shopfront – the sloping, front display windows were removed, and new vertical windows that spanned the full width of the site were installed. The pond was concreted in, the glass walls removed, a section of the front awning's ceiling painted over and the light-wells roofed over (although their locations were still visible). The workshop at the rear was demolished between 1974 and 1986, and a skillion-roofed shed was constructed in its place.
In 2008, architect Robert Riddel purchased the building and carried out extensive renovations and conservation work. This was completed with the guidance of Laurence West himself, contemporary documentation, and the evidence provided by original fabric remaining within the building. Marks in the front stone wall and the ceiling lining enabled Riddel to reconstruct the front window at the original angle. A new front door was also installed, replicating the original design. The side pedestrian arcade was re-established with new glass walls, and a new wide glass door and metal ramp were added to the end of the arcade to provide a secondary entrance and equal access. Concrete that had filled the serpentine pond was removed, revealing some early edging and concrete pads. The pond was waterproofed, with the edging reconstructed, and it was once again filled with water. Light-wells were uncovered and re-glazed, with the original arched framing re-sheeted. Paint was removed from the hardwood timber posts and front awning's soffit cladding, and the showroom ceiling was sheeted with new plasterboard. The shed at the rear of the site was gutted, re-lined and its roof was raised; and a new carport was added facing Knapp Street.
Construction was carried out by John Speare Builders and was completed in 2009. In early 2010, the building was converted for use as an office through the addition of lightweight partitions, and was occupied by Riddel Architecture until 2012.
Riddel's restoration and reconstruction of West's Furniture Showroom received both national and international praise and recognition. In 2009 it was awarded a Gold Medal award at the National Trust Heritage Awards, and in 2010 it received the Australian Institute of Architects State and National awards for Heritage. The Jury Citation for the National Award for Heritage praises the Showroom as "...a rare example of the restoration of a mid-century modernist commercial building", and that the reinterpretation and rebuilding process was:
...painstaking but practical and economical. The architects have helped to demonstrate the economic and environmental benefits of preservation over new build. This is not a museum frozen in time. The spirit is faithfully captured; details restored with rigour, energy, affection and wit; and the building revitalized as viable commercial premises.
The project also appeared in publications including "IndesignLive" (12 August 2009), "Brisbane Modern" (Issue 3, 2009), Architecture Australia (vol. 99, January–February 2010), Feminity (6 August 2010), and Architecture and Urban Design in Brisbane (vol. 1, 2012). Brisbane Open House, an event launched in 2010 to promote the 'hidden wealth of architecture, engineering and history in buildings and places around Brisbane city', featured West's Furniture Showroom in 2011, 2012 and 2013. The building was also included in the 2014 exhibition Hot Modernism: Building Modern Queensland, 1945–75 at the State Library of Queensland, along with furniture pieces from the Wests' collection.
After a short period of vacancy, in September 2015 the former West's Furniture Showroom is being renovated for use as a retail tenancy, with the rear additions converted into living quarters.
Description.
The former West's Furniture Showroom occupies part of a urban block on the northeast edge of Fortitude Valley, Brisbane. Addressing the major thoroughfare of Wickham Street to the southeast, the building is bounded to the northwest by Knapp Street, and to the northeast and southwest by commercial properties of a similar scale. The terraced block is divided into three distinct sections, with the showroom occupying the southeast end. Buildings to the rear of the showroom are outside of the heritage boundary and are not of cultural heritage significance. A cantilevered awning projects from the showroom, over the Wickham Street footpath.
The showroom is a long, lowset, masonry and timber structure with a narrow street frontage. Primary access to the building is via a door at the northeast end of the main shopfront. A pedestrian arcade, running part way along the southwest side, allows access to the rear of the showroom via a secondary entrance. The shallow-pitched roof, constructed of deep timber trusses, is clad in metal sheeting.
The Wickham Street shopfront is largely transparent and sheltered by a large, cantilevered awning that has a tongue-and-groove, v-jointed timber board-lined soffit with a stained finish. The timber entrance door is painted yellow and set within a timber and glass frame, adjacent to a masonry wall clad in random rubble stone. The shopfront comprises reconstructed floor-to-ceiling, steel-framed angled windows, standing on concrete and rubber pads and supported by timber mullions. Angled at 60 degrees, these windows reduce the reflection of light from the glass to pedestrians on the exterior footpath, and reflect the sky from a distance. An irregular-shaped shallow pond with a raised concrete kerb forms the base of the shopfront, with the bottom edge of the glass panels set just below the water's surface. The pond continues around at a right angle to follow the base of a reconstructed glass wall that defines the side pedestrian arcade. The pedestrian arcade has an exposed concrete floor and rectangular ceiling voids which allow light to enter the space. It is partly enclosed by the adjacent property's masonry wall, which is painted in a contrasting colour to distinguish it from original walls.
Shopfront features added as part of the 2008 reconstruction works that differ from the original design include: a metal entrance gate to the pedestrian arcade; a wide glass door at the end of the arcade; metal grates set below the surface of the pond; and a signage display outlining the building's reconstruction. These features are not of cultural heritage significance.
The showroom comprises a large, open space with plasterboard-lined walls and ceilings, and a polished concrete floor. A single row of hardwood timber columns, stained dark brown and standing on metal pin-joints, runs from the front to the rear of the space. These align with plaster-lined pilasters along the northeast wall. The space is naturally spot-lit by skylights: a row of three small, oval-shaped skylights are located just inside the shopfront windows; and three large, rectangular skylights with a curved southwest edge run the length of the showroom along its central axis. The lower portion of the rear wall of the showroom acts as a retaining wall, with banks of aluminium-framed awning windows above. In the centre of this wall is a steep concrete stair with tubular steel handrail, which leads to the rear building. Separating the showroom and the rear building is a wide, earth-floored void and a second retaining wall. This void is protected by a roof overhang, and access is gained from the stair, through openings in the walls. The showroom roof overhang is set at a steep angle to allow natural light to enter the space, and louvres within its soffit are part of the original ventilation system for cooling the roof space.
Showroom features that are not of cultural heritage significance include: partition walls at the rear of the showroom; a curved partition at the front of the space that defines an entry foyer; recent fit-outs and joinery; and air-conditioning units and vents.
Heritage listing.
West's Furniture Showroom was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 4 December 2015 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The former West's Furniture Showroom (opened in 1953) is important in demonstrating the evolution of architecture and design in the 1950s in Queensland. Purpose-designed as a showroom for Modern furniture, it was influential in the promotion of contemporary design both within the design community and to the general public. It is a distinctive example of a 1950s showroom in Queensland, reflecting modern design principles and aspirations.
The former West's Furniture Showroom is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a 1950s showroom, with its carefully detailed shopfront and entrance; large display windows; well-lit, open-plan interior; and clear division between public and private space, with functional and storage spaces located at the rear of the building. It is a fine example of a purpose-designed furniture showroom designed in a bold, modernist style that complemented the furniture it sold.
The place is a good example of the work of architect Dr Karl Langer, and is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of his work. Most notably, it features an open, functional plan; the expressive use of simplified, angular forms to create a dramatic main shopfront; the manipulation of the effects of natural light, both within the showroom and from the perspective of the viewer outside; a restrained use of high-quality materials, including stone, concrete, glass and timber; and the integration of the interior with the exterior by utilising the effects of glass, water and reflections.
The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.
The West's Furniture Showroom has aesthetic significance as a distinctive building of exceptional architectural quality. In its extensive use of concrete and glass complemented by simple primary colours, stained timber and stone, the showroom illustrates the honest use of materials and minimal aesthetic that characterises the mid-20th century modern movement. This is further complemented by the transparent shopfront with subtle framing, open plan interior supported by a single row of columns, and the emphasis on natural lighting.
The main shopfront, with its bold composition of slanted display windows, curvilinear concrete pond and large angled awning, makes an important contribution to the streetscape, standing out dramatically from the adjacent commercial buildings.

Fillan (municipality)

Fillan is a former municipality in the old Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. The former municipality existed from 1886 until its dissolution in 1964. It is now part of the municipality of Hitra in Trøndelag county. The municipality included the northeastern part of the island of Hitra surrounding the Fillfjorden, plus about 100 islands, islets, and skerries—including Fjellværsøya and Ulvøya. The administrative centre of the municipality was the village of Fillan. Other villages in the municipality included Ansnes, Nordbotn, and Ulvan.
The former municipality had a church and a chapel in it, both of which now form a parish within the present-day municipality of Hitra. The Fillan church is located in the village of Fillan and the Nordbotn chapel is located on the island of Fjellværsøya.
History.
The municipality of Fillan was established on 1 January 1886 when it was separated from the municipality of Hitra to form a municipality of its own. The initial population of the new municipality was 2,241. On 1 July 1914, the southern district of Sandstad was separated from Fillan to form its own municipality, leaving 1,543 residents in Fillan. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, the neighboring municipalities of Fillan, Sandstad, Kvenvær, and Hitra were merged to re-form the old pre-1886 Hitra municipality. Prior to the merger, Fillan had 1,759 residents.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Fillan, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads.

Werner Roch (bishop of Płock)

Werner Roch (died 5 February 1170) was bishop of Płock in the years 1156-1170.
Biography.
He was probably a German.
He witnessed, on the privilege of Princess Salomei, for the abbey in Mogilno (around 1143) as a chaplain (canon) of the collegiate church of St. Peter in Kruszwica. He was a close associate of Prince Bolesław Kędzierzawego, who in 1156 appointed him a bishop of Płock. In 1161 he participated in a rally in Łęczyca.
In 1165 he presided over the message to Emperor Frederick I in Aachen. He brought relics from Germany from Germany. Zygmunt Burgundzki, later patron of Płock. He was an advocate of the imperial antipopes of Victor IV, Paschalis III and Kalikst III, he represented the Polish Episcopate at the canonization celebrations of Charlemagne in 1165, led by Paschalis III.
He died a martyr's death, murdered on the orders of the magnate, who lost a court dispute with him about the village of Karso (Szarsko?). He was worshiped by the faithful after death and placed in the lists of saints and blessed at the time, but due to his support for the anti-Pope his cult did not gain the recognition of the Church after the schism.
In the older literature, his martyrdom is sometimes erroneously dated to 1172.
Some contemporary historians identify him with Warner, Bishop of Włocławek, mentioned in the papal bull of Eugene III from 1148. This identification, however possible, is not supported by any positive source message.

Vladimir Polevanov

Vladimir Pavlovich Polevanov (; born 11 November 1949, Kharkov, Ukrainian SSR, USSR) is a former Russian politician who served as a Deputy Chairman of Government of the Russian Federation during the administration of President Boris Yeltsin. He was also chairman of the State Property Committee and governor of the Amur Oblast.
In government.
Originally he had been the governor of the Amur Oblast (1993–1994) who had supported Yeltsin during the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis. The fall of the Russian ruble against the dollar in October 1994 brought about a shakeup in Yeltsin's economic team. Polevanov was recommended by Anatoly Chubais, although he was originally a geologist by profession. He was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Russia and chairman of the State Property Committee (Russia's privatization agency) on 15 November 1994. Polevanov was removed from those positions on 24 January 1995 after advocating for the re-nationalization of certain sectors after their "improper privatization," including energy and defense; objecting to the influence of foreign investment; and barring Western advisors from the Committee, to protect national secrets. In effect, Polevanov was criticized for being against privatizing key sectors of the economy, which he believed was threat to national security–something that damaged the confidence of foreign investors. This cooled his relations with Chubais, who later engineered his removal from the post.

As of 2018, he is a senior writer at "Tablet" magazine, where he covers politics, culture, and religion, tackling topics ranging from American Jewish responses to modern critical scholarship of the Bible, to contemporary Islamophobia to the forgotten history of Mormon-Jewish relations. In particular, he has chronicled the resurgence of anti-Semitism in Europe and in America. He is also known for his parodies of antisemites on Twitter, and more serious efforts to combat abuse on online platforms.
A frequent speaker and commentator on these topics, he has addressed audiences in locales as varied as New York, Seattle, Austin's South By Southwest, Jerusalem's Global Forum for Combating Anti-Semitism, and the Limmud conference in Melbourne, Australia. Rosenberg has been interviewed and cited by "The New York Times", "Washington Post", Associated Press, CNN, Fast Company, CBC News, and "The Rachel Maddow Show", among others.
Rosenberg's writings have received awards from the Harvard Center for Jewish Studies and the Religion Newswriters Association. In 2017, he was named as one of "36 Under 36" by New York's "Jewish Week" newspaper.
Target of anti-Semitism.
In 2016, a report by the Anti-Defamation League's Task Force on Journalism and Harassment identified Rosenberg as the second-most targeted Jewish journalist receiving online anti-Semitic abuse due to his critical reporting on Donald Trump's candidacy, following conservative writer Ben Shapiro, and ahead of journalists Jeffrey Goldberg, Sally Kohn and Jake Tapper. "My parents didn't raise me to be number 2," he later wrote in "The New York Times". "Fortunately, there's always 2020."
Since the report's publication, Rosenberg has focused extensively on the issue of online harassment and antisemitism, including through the creation of the "Impostor Buster" Twitter bot that exposed neo-Nazi trolls masquerading as minorities on the platform, which received coverage from "The New York Times" and other global news outlets. Rosenberg also wrote about his experience and efforts to combat online abuse in the "Times".
Music.
Rosenberg is a singer and composer of original Jewish music. In March 2020, he released his first two singles, "Shalom Aleichem" and "Lecha Dodi", and announced a forthcoming album. His collaborators include singers Arun Viswanath and Abbaleh Savitt, as well as producer Charles Newman. "Rosenberg is not the only musically inclined member of his family," reported "Jewish Insider", "his grandfather was a Hasidic composer who, as a young man, escaped Nazi Europe with the assistance of Japanese diplomat Chiune Sugihara, who issued him a visa. In time, Rosenberg’s grandfather ended up in China, eventually making his way to the United States."

Early life.
Cutler was born in Boston to Roger W. and Leslie Bradley Cutler. His father was a noted rower who had been captain of the Harvard Crew in 1911 and competed in the 1914 Henley Royal Regatta as a member of the Union Boat Club.
Athletic career.
Cutler attended the Noble &amp; Greenough School, but later transferred to Kent School. He did not make the Kent varsity crew as a starter, but in 1932 went to the Henley Royal Regatta as a substitute. He went on to Harvard College. During his sophomore year (1935) he was promoted from No. 2 on the junior varsity crew to varsity pace setter. He returned to the JV squad in 1936, but was promoted to varsity No 2. in May. That same year, Cutler was also a member of a Riverside Boat Club crew (which consisted of himself, his brother Robert, William Haskins, J. Paul Austin, and Edward Bennett) that sought to make the U.S. Olympic team. On July 4, 1936, The Riverside Boat Club qualified for the Olympics by defeating the Washington Huskies.

Utopia (internet forum)

Utopia () is a Chinese internet forum noted for its strong support of Maoist and communist ideology. The forum is notable for its promotion of Maoist philosophy and for its occasional clashes with the Chinese Communist Party.
History.
Utopia was founded in 2003 by Fan Jinggang, who owned a bookstore (also named Utopia, ) in Beijing, China. The forum was created with the stated intent to be “a patriotic website for the public interest", and soon acquired a political lean towards Maoism.
In 2011, Utopia organized a campaign against Chinese writer Mao Yushi and historian Xin Zilin who wrote and published critical histories of Mao Zedong. The campaign involved organizing of a petition of 40,000 signatures, including those of Liu Siqi (the widow of one of Mao's sons), former vice-minister Ma Bin, and Peking University professor Kong Qingdong.
In April 2012, following the arrest and prosecution of Chinese politician Bo Xilai, Utopia along with several other leftist Chinese websites was temporarily shut down.
In 2013 the forum supported Bo Xilai during the Wang Lijun incident in which Xilai and a number other Chinese politicians were investigated under suspicion of corruption. Utopia continued to support Bo Xilai when the Maoist was removed from his position as Communist Party Secretary of Chongqing, after which the forum was shut down for several months. However, Utopia continued to announce its support for Bo.
Utopia played a prominent role in the Jasic incident of 2018, in which striking workers, student activist and neo-Maoists protested poor working conditions of the Jasic Technology Co., Ltd. factory in Shenzhen, Guangdong. The website was used as a platform to organize supporters of the Jasic workers.

Lieutenant Governor Athletic Awards

The Lieutenant Governor Athletic Awards, formerly known as the Borden Ladner Gervais (BLG) Awards and Howard, Mackie Awards, are given annually to top male and female athletes in Canadian universities that are members of U Sports. Each of the 56 member schools nominate a female and male athlete of the year which are further narrowed down to representatives from each of the four athletics conference of U Sports (Atlantic University Sport, Canada West Universities Athletic Association, Ontario University Athletics, and Réseau du sport étudiant du Québec). The eight nominees each receive a commemorative durilium ring and the two winners receive $10,000 post-graduate scholarships and are awarded the Doug and Lois Mitchell Trophy. The nominees must have participated in their sport for at least two years and cannot win the award more than once.
History.
The awards were founded in 1993 by Douglas Mitchell who wanted to provide more recognition for Canadian university athletes. They were initially named after Mitchell's law firm Howard, Mackie in Calgary, Alberta. After a merger of law firms in 2000, the awards were renamed the BLG Awards after the new law firm Borden Ladner Gervais. The awards were further rebranded as the Lieutenant Governor Athletic Awards in 2019 while continuing to be championed by Mitchell and his wife, Lois Mitchell, the 18th Lieutenant Governor of Alberta. The women's winner was awarded the Jim Thompson Trophy as of 2003 and the men's winner was awarded the Doug Mitchell Trophy as of 2009. Starting in 2020, both winners are awarded Doug &amp; Lois Mitchell Trophies while the Jim Thompson Trophy is now given to a distinguished alumni beginning in 2021.

<doc id="56601158" url="?curid=56601158" title="Genode">
Genode

Genode is a free and open-source software operating system (OS) framework consisting of a microkernel abstraction layer and a set of user space components. The framework is notable as one of the few open-source operating systems not derived from a proprietary OS, such as Unix. The characteristic design philosophy is that a small trusted computing base is of primary concern in a security-oriented OS.
Genode can be used as a basis for a desktop computer or tablet OS or as a virtual machine monitor for guest operating systems. The framework has been used as trusted component of secure virtualization systems for both x86 and ARM.
The small codebase of Genode makes it a flexible alternative to more complex Unix-derived operating systems. For this reason the framework has been used as a base system for research in such fields as virtualization, inter-process communication, IP stack isolation, monitoring, and software development.
History.
Genode was first conceived as the Bastei OS Architecture research report at the Technical University of Dresden (TU Dresden). The focus of the report was to determine the practicality of a component-based OS using capability-based security. This report was motivated in part by research into L4 microhypervisors conducted during the same time. Following the success of an early prototype, the authors of the report founded the company Genode Labs to develop Bastei as the Genode OS Framework.
Releases.
The project is developed publicly as an open source project released under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License with a commercial entity offering alternative licensing. Releases are scheduled at three-month intervals to make changes to the system application binary interface (ABI), application programming interface (API), and issue documentation. The OS framework is available in source code form and following the 18.02 release a general purpose derivative named Sculpt is provided with on-target binary deployment.
Architectural features.
Genode builds on the general philosophy of microkernels: the smaller and simpler the code, the easier it is to verify for trustworthiness and correctness. Genode extends this philosophy to user space by composing complex applications from small components. Each component exists in a strict hierarchy of parent-child relationships. Any component acting as a parent may apply resource and inter-process communication (IPC) access policies to its children. This hierarchical system layout yields intuitive partitioning and privilege deescalation as specialized subsystems are nested within more general subsystems, mitigating the confused deputy problem endemic to centralized or superuser system policy.
The framework is designed to be hosted by microkernels, however the features of any given microkernel fall mostly within a common set, and monolithic kernels implement a superset of those features. Abstracting these features allows Genode to act as user space for variety of L4 microkernels, and Linux.
Criticism.
C++.
Genode is often criticized for the choice of its implementation language, C++ (a few other operating systems implemented in C++ include BeOS, Fuchsia, Ghost, Haiku, IncludeOS, OSv, Palm OS, ReactOS, Syllable, and all major browser engines). This critique usually asserts that C++ is a poor choice for implementing system libraries and APIs because of the inherent complexity of C++ and the difficulty in analyzing code for correct behavior. While Genode does make use of multiple inheritance and templates in its system library, the use of the C++ Standard Library is not allowed and language features that rely on implicit global state, such as thread-local storage and the global allocator, have been removed from the language runtime. Comprehensive static analysis of C++ is not possible. However, the Genode project publishes unit tests for empirical analysis.
XML.
Genode components consume and publish state using structured data serialized in XML, in contrast to the plain text model of Unix derivatives. The Genode framework makes use of XML in effectively all of its components because XML is easily parsed and generated programmatically while still being possible to understand and edit manually.
Local namespacing.
Genode lacks any practical global namespace; there is no global file system or registry of processes or IPC endpoints. This is in contrast to systems such as Unix which feature a ubiquitous file system and allow a superuser context to arbitrarily manage any process within the system. Explicitly declaring the permissions and routing of components may be perceived as labor-intensive relative to Unix. However, compartmentalizing administration allows subsystems to be managed by mutually untrusted system administrators on the same machine without resorting to virtualizing, a common isolation method.
Sculpt.
The Genode project publishes a desktop operating system named "Sculpt" that targets contemporary consumer laptops. Sculpt is a small base system with automatic device detection and configuration, some GUI control interfaces, and frontends to the Genode package manager. The system does not feature a full desktop environment, but requires users to deploy virtual machines hosting traditional OSes for a fully featured desktop. Sculpt is distinguished from the Genode operating system framework in that it relies heavily on dynamic reconfiguration using privileged control components in contrast to specialized systems with static policies.

Jaroslav Eminger

Jaroslav Eminger (4 June 1886 – 14 July 1964) was a Czech military officer who commanded the Government Army during the period of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.
Military career.
Eminger was educated at the Theresian Military Academy and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army on the Russian and Italian fronts in World War I. Between 1919 and 1922 he led the new Czechoslovak military mission in Budapest, coordinating its intelligence-gathering activities. Returning to Czechoslovakia, he advanced through the ranks as a cavalry officer, ultimately coming to command the 3rd Fast Division. Eminger left the country following the German occupation of the Czech lands in 1939 but was persuaded by Alois Eliáš to return to help lead the creation of the new Government Army, of which he became the first commander in August. As inspector-general of the Government Army, Eminger was made General 2nd Class on 11 November 1939 and promoted to General 1st Class on 1 August 1942.
During his time leading the Government Army, Eminger pursued a program of outward cooperation with the German authorities while quietly working to ensure the army's operational incompetence and turning a blind eye to resistance activities on the part of soldiers. In 1943 the Government Army was deployed in an attempt to capture parachutist drop sites in Bohemia and Moravia used by resistance fighters and the Allies. According to one account, when asked by a subordinate officer what Protectorate soldiers should do in the event they successfully intercepted parachutists, Eminger replied, "if there are few you will ignore them, if there are many you will join them".
In the spring of 1944, Ferdinand Schaal requested Emil Hácha order the deployment of the Government Army to Italy to assist German military operations there, a deployment Eminger protested in vain. One of Eminger's final acts as commander of the Government Army came on 5 May 1945, when he ordered the army's 1st Battalion to turn their weapons against the Wehrmacht in the Battle of Czechoslovak Radio.
Arrest and exoneration.
Eminger was arrested after the end of World War II and, in April 1947, went on trial on charges of collaboration with Germany. He was acquitted of all charges, with the court recording the verdict that Eminger was "a loyal Czech and a brave man". He lived the rest of his life in secluded retirement.

Enlightenment Now

Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress is a 2018 book written by Canadian-American cognitive scientist Steven Pinker. It argues that the Enlightenment values of reason, science, and humanism have brought progress; shows our progress with data that health, prosperity, safety, peace, and happiness have tended to rise worldwide; and explains the cognitive science of why this progress should be appreciated. It is a follow-up to Pinker's 2011 book, "The Better Angels of Our Nature."
Thesis.
A commonly-held lay public perception holds that the world is in terrible shape; for some, 2016 was the "worst year ever" and the year that liberalism died. In contrast, Pinker argues that life has been getting better for most people. He sets out 15 different measures of human wellbeing to support this argument, with the most obvious being the uncontroversial fact that, statistically, people live longer and healthier lives on average than ever before. As another example, while fears of terrorism are often voiced in U.S. opinion polls, Pinker shows that an American is 3,000 times more likely to die in an accident than in a terrorist attack. As in Pinker's previous "The Better Angels of Our Nature", Pinker ascribes modern improvements to trends of liberal humanism and scientific rationality that first took root in Europe around the 17th and 18th centuries.
Pinker argues that economic inequality "is not itself a dimension of human wellbeing" and cites a study that finds inequality is not linked to unhappiness, at least in poorer societies. He also points out that the world as a whole is becoming more equal, and states that even within increasingly unequal areas, the poor are still getting wealth and benefit from technological innovations. For example, it is clear to Pinker that an innovation that makes the poor slightly richer and the rich massively richer is a positive rather than a negative achievement. In contrast, critics hold that enhancing social mobility and combating "inequality as a result of unfairness" are important legitimate ends in and of themselves, beyond any effects of reducing poverty.
On topics such as nuclear weaponry, Pinker places the blame on anti-Enlightenment forces. Scientists working on the Manhattan Project to develop the first nuclear weapons did so because they needed to beat Hitler; Pinker states "Quite possibly, had there been no Nazis, there would be no nukes." In contrast, critics point out that science lacks any ethical logic of its own. They argue that scientific progress is liberating but also threatening, and can present dangers precisely because of how hugely it expands human power. Pinker expresses concerns about potential human extinction from nuclear weapons or from global warming, but categorizes existential risks overall as a "useless category", stating that "Sowing fear about hypothetical disasters, far from safeguarding the future of humanity, can endanger it". In particular, Pinker departs from scholars such as Nick Bostrom regarding the possibility of accidental existential risk from artificial general intelligence, and makes a controversial "reductio ad absurdum" argument that self-driving cars provide evidence that artificial general intelligence will pose no accidental existential risk.
The book concludes with three chapters defending what Pinker sees as Enlightenment values: reason, science, and humanism. Pinker argues that these values are under threat from modern trends such as religious fundamentalism, political correctness, and postmodernism. In an interview about the book published in "Scientific American", Pinker has clarified that his book is not merely an expression of hope—it is a documentation of how much we have gained as a result of Enlightenment values, and how much we have to lose if those values are abandoned.
Marketing.
In January 2018 Bill Gates tweeted praise for "Enlightenment Now", calling it "my new favorite book". Gates stated he agreed overall with the techno-optimism of the book, but cautioned that Pinker is too "quick to dismiss" the idea that artificial superintelligence could someday lead to human extinction. Citing reader interest due to Gates' endorsement, Viking Press moved the publication date from 27 February 2018 to 13 February 2018.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" gave the book a glowing review, concluding that "In an era of increasingly 'dystopian rhetoric,' Pinker’s sober, lucid, and meticulously researched vision of human progress is heartening and important." "The Times" also gave the book a positive review, stating that Pinker's arguments and evidence are "as entertaining as they are important", and expressing hope that Pinker's defense of the forces that have produced progress will be successful.
"The New York Times" described the book as "an excellent book, lucidly written, timely, rich in data and eloquent in its championing of a rational humanism that is — it turns out — really quite cool." "The Economist" agreed with Pinker that "barring a cataclysmic asteroid strike or nuclear war, it is likely that (the world) will continue to get better". Timothy Sandefur, writing for The Objective Standard, praised the book, noting, "Pinker’s catalog of improvements is enjoyable, largely thanks to his witty style and skill at examining progress in unexpected ways."
In "Skeptical Inquirer" Kendrick Frazier concurs that Pinker "argues [his] case eloquently and ... effectively, drawing on both the demographic data and our improved understanding of human biases that get in our way of seeing the truth." In "Nature", Ian Goldin wrote that Pinker should have focused more on future risks, although Pinker did devote a chapter to existential threats, and concludes with "But for the many overwhelmed by gloom, it is a welcome antidote." A review in the "London Evening Standard" agrees with Pinker's summary of how rationality has improved the world, and state "On Islamism, where his optimism falters, we have the interesting phenomenon of Muslim youth — not least in countries like Afghanistan — becoming less liberal than their parents" although they do not provide a source for this claim.
John P. Tang, writing in "The Journal of Economic History", stated that Pinker demonstrates that "humanity has never had it so good, things until recently were much worse, and life will likely continue to improve." He stated the book provides an "empirical and quantitative approach to the topic, perhaps to the chagrin of humanities scholars, but consistent with current scholarship in the social sciences and economic history." He critiqued the book for its reliance on utilitarianism due to its practical difficulties, and for not convincingly demonstrating that it was the Enlightenment that caused the trends Pinker identifies.
"Kirkus Reviews" called it "overstuffed", and noted though Pinker is progressive, "the academically orthodox will find him an apostate". "The Guardian" and "The Financial Times" dismissed Pinker's contention that the left is partly to blame for anti-reason rhetoric and objected to Pinker's criticism of groups such as postmodernists, de-growth environmentalists, and people whom Pinker deems to be "social justice warriors". British philosopher John Gray criticized Pinker as promoting scientism and discussed historical examples of strong desire for human progress leading to the misuse of science for immoral policies. Gray also argued that Pinker had misunderstood Friedrich Nietzsche.
Some reviewers disagreed with Pinker's quantitative approach to assessing progress. "Booklist" stated that "(Pinker's) seemingly casual dismissal of ethics concerns surrounding the Tuskegee experiment is troubling to say the least." Pinker had written that the Tuskegee experiment "was patently unethical by today’s standards, though it’s often misreported to pile up the indictment," and when properly reported, "when the study began, it may even have been defensible by the standards of the day."
Political scientist Nicolas Guilhot sharply criticizes the book for what he sees as "finessed statistics" marshaled in service of preconceived conclusions, and for being "one inch deep". He concludes: "Much of what Pinker writes about the humanities would be a comical caricature if it did not represent a coherent ideological offensive that is reshaping higher education and research."
In the "Los Angeles Review of Books", Stanford University historian Jessica Riskin summarizes the book as "a knot of Orwellian contradictions". She states that Pinker believes that skepticism is a negative influence on society, and objects that the very Enlightenment heroes Pinker praises, such as Immanuel Kant, David Hume, Denis Diderot and Adam Smith, were all advocates of skepticism. She concludes, "What we need in this time of political, environmental, and cultural crisis is precisely the value Pinker rejects but that his Enlightenment heroes embraced, whatever their differences of opinion on other matters: skepticism, and an attendant spirit of informed criticism."

Adelaide Times

The Adelaide Times was an early newspaper founded by James Allen and printed in Adelaide, the capital of the then colony of South Australia. It was published between 2 October 1848 and 8 May 1858, and evolved through a series of names and publication frequencies, and closed due to uncertainty surrounding Allen's bankruptcy.
History.
The "Adelaide Times" was established by Allen, an experienced newspaper man, in partnership with John Brown and William Barlow Gilbert. Allen, who had just visited England in 1845-1848, had previously worked on other local newspapers, the "Southern Australian and South Australian Register," and periodicals such as "South Australian Magazine and Monthly Almanac and Illustrated Commentator."
The newspaper's original format and masthead were copied from "The Times" of London. It was published weekly from October 1848; semiweekly from October 1849; three times a week from March 1850; and, daily from April 1850. As was common for the time, it evolved through various titles, such as "The Adelaide Times and General Commercial Advertiser" (15 January 1849 – 10 September 1849) and "The Times" (6 March 1850 – 16 November 1853).
In November 1853 Allen sold the newspaper to a consortium, including Richard Hanson, Robert Torrens, George Stevenson, John Brown, and Edward Gwynne. W. M. Akhurst, who was reporter and sub-editor, resigned rather than work under the new owners. "The Adelaide Times" was later sold to Allen's former partner, Gilbert, but in 1855 Gilbert went bankrupt and the newspaper was re-purchased by Allen, who himself went bankrupt in early 1858. Shortly afterwards, Rev. John Henry Barrow, a former editor of the "South Australian Register" founded the morning newspaper "The South Australian Advertiser" and a companion weekly "The South Australian Weekly Chronicle."
Gilbert, who was a nephew of Thomas Gilbert, later moved to Victoria, where he worked for The Argus and became a reporter for the Victorian Hansard. He next returned to Adelaide, where he held various Government positions. He died on 13 March 1893.

In 2015, Zhang played the male lead in historical drama "Legend of Ban Shu" with Jing Tian. He went on to play lead roles in the spy drama "Decoded", and headlined both seasons of the fantasy web series "Demon Girl".

Controversy.
On August 13, 2021, photos surfaced online of Zhang posing in front of cherry blossom trees at Japan's Yasukuni Shrine and attending a wedding held at Nogi Shrine in 2018. The shrines are controversial in China due to their honoring of imperial Japanese military officers who invaded China during World War II. Additional photos emerged of a modified car with a Rising Sun Flag emblem in the background of a picture which had been posted on his Weibo account for which he had previously apologized and promptly deleted in 2018. The photos sparked outrage among Chinese netizens. Zhang issued an apology, stating: "Today I am ashamed of my once-ignorant self and I have to apologize deeply for my previous misconduct. Due to a lack of knowledge, the photos I took seriously hurt the feelings of Chinese people. I solemnly apologize. I'm sorry. I am not pro-Japanese; I am Chinese. As a public figure, I should always keep in mind the pain in history. In the future, I will learn more about history, culture, enrich my professionalism, be more rigorous and self-disciplined. I solemnly apologize once again." In response, the "People’s Daily" stated: "As a public figure, a lack of historical knowledge and unknowingness of the suffering of the nation is unacceptable." The controversial photos resulted in the termination of 27 brand endorsements, including Pandora, Clinique, Maybelline, Nivea, Ariel, Costa Coffee, Coca-Cola, and Taobao. His upcoming films and television shows also terminated associations with him.
The China Association of Performing Arts (CAPA), an NPO made up of voluntary members from the performance arts community, then called for an entertainment boycott on Zhang. Sina Weibo shut down his Super Topic, personal and studio accounts and his accounts were removed from Douyin, Douban and other Chinese sites. QQ Music and NetEase Music removed Zhang's songs from their music platforms. On 21 August, Tencent Video, Youku, iQIYI and Mango TV took down his film and television works from their streaming platforms in China voluntarily .

Cowboy (band)

Cowboy was an American country rock and southern rock band formed in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1969. The group's main members consisted of songwriters Tommy Talton and Scott Boyer, alongside a rotating group of musicians. They released four albums on the Capricorn Records label in the 1970s: "Reach for the Sky" (1970), "5'll Getcha Ten" (1971), "Boyer and Talton" (1974), and "Cowboy" (1977). The song "Please Be with Me"–perhaps their best-known song–featured a performance from Duane Allman. It was also later covered by Eric Clapton on his album "461 Ocean Boulevard" (1974).
The group's sound has been compared to Hearts &amp; Flowers, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, and Pure Prairie League. Steve Leggett of Allmusic considered Cowboy "one of Capricorn Records' and Southern rock's best-kept secrets during the genre's golden age in the 1970s." The group reformed in 2007 and recorded an album, released a decade later as "10'll Getcha Twenty". In addition, this iteration also issued a live album, "Boyer &amp; Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010".
Biography.
Cowboy was formed in 1969 in Jacksonville, Florida by singer-songwriters Scott Boyer and Tommy Talton, with pianist/guitarist Bill Pillmore, bassist George Clark, guitarist Pete Kowalke, and drummer Tom Wynn rounding out the original lineup. The six musicians, all from around the Orlando/Jacksonville area, rented a home in Jacksonville where they lived and rehearsed together. Previously, Boyer had played with Duane Allman and his brother, Gregg, in the folk-rock group the 31st of February. Duane, at that point of the Allman Brothers Band, suggested them to Phil Walden, owner of Capricorn Records. Leggett writes that the band's lineup was ever-changing during this time, besides "Talton and Boyer, both of whom became de facto members of the Capricorn house band, playing with the Allman Brothers, Gregg Allman, Alex Taylor, and Bonnie Bramlett." Their debut album, "Reach for the Sky", was released in 1971, and their second, "5'll Getcha Ten", followed later that year. The latter album featured "Please Be with Me", which featured Allman on dobro. Eric Clapton later covered the song for his album "461 Ocean Boulevard" (1974).
By 1972, much of the original Cowboy lineup departed. "People just started moving in different directions. I don't remember there being any animosity about it," Talton recalled in 2014. He and Boyer continued on as Cowboy, supporting Gregg Allman on his first solo effort "Laid Back" in 1973, and accompanying him as his backing band on its ensuing tour, which was captured on the 1974 live album "The Gregg Allman Tour". The band's third album, "Boyer &amp; Talton", saw release the same year. Their final, self-titled record was released in 1977. Leggett also notes that "the 1976 album "Happy to Be Alive", attributed to the trio of Tommy Talton, Bill Stewart, and Johnny Sandlin, might be considered a Cowboy album in all but name."
Boyer and Talton continued to work together sporadically over the years. They reformed Cowboy thirty years after their dissolution in 2007. This iteration recorded at least an album's worth of music with Sandlin at his studio, Duck Tape Studio, in Decatur, Alabama. When asked about the album in an interview some years later, Boyer told AL.com that "the project fell to the wayside. We ran into some technical difficulties." In 2010, they performed their first concert in over thirty years, billed as Cowboy/Boyer &amp; Talton, at the Cox Capital Theatre in Macon. They were joined by Stewart on drums, Stan Robertson on bass, and Randall Bramblett on keyboards, saxophone, and vocals. It was issued the following year as a live album, titled "Boyer &amp; Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010".
Boyer died on February 13, 2018. His musical partner Talton said, "No one could write a more beautiful ballad than Scott Boyer. I love him and I miss him more than anything that can be said." Later that year, the band's final reunion album, titled "10'll Getcha Twenty", was released. It features the recordings made in 2007, and marks not only the original members' final recordings, but producer Sandlin's as well.

Sotero Julao Baluyut was born on January 3, 1889, in San Fernando, Pampanga. His parents were Leoncio Baluyut and Casimira Julao. In 1904, Baluyut was given the opportunity to study at the expense of the government in the United States. After he studied in Santa Ana Central and High School in California and the University Summer School of Illinois, he obtained a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Iowa.

Gerson Borrero

Gerson Borrero is a journalist, radio host, and TV political commentator. Among other posts, he has been editor-at-large of City &amp; State NY and editor-in-chief of El Diario/La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New York City.
His coverage has ranged from New York City politics, cultural reviews and personality profiles, to the Somos El Futuro Conference and the Puerto Rican Day Parade.
In addition to his print reporting, Borrero has been a New York City radio host for over two decades. He currently appears on the popular TV news show "Political Rundown" on New York 1, with Errol Louis and WABC Radio's Curtis Sliwa.
Early years.
Borrero was born in 1950 in Ponce, Puerto Rico, and came to New York City at age 4.
He and his brother were raised by their single mother, Noelia Maldonado, who worked at a jewelry factory and sold Avon and home cleaning products.
Growing up in the Bronx, Borrero was argumentative in school. He disagreed with his teachers frequently and vehemently. To this day, Borrero "wonders how he managed to get good grades."
Borrero's "notorious candor" got him in trouble with an elementary schoolteacher. The teacher pulled his ears and dug her nails into them, which prompted Borrero to throw a milk tray at her. At this point, Borrero's mother sent him back to Puerto Rico for a few years.
In 1980, Borrero was a co-founder of the "Committee Against Fort Apache," which protested against the negative imagery and racial stereotyping of the movie "Fort Apache, the Bronx."
On another occasion, Borrero led a protest when Madonna rubbed a Puerto Rican flag between her legs.
Borrero helped found the Institute for Puerto Rican Policy. He later opened a public relations firm, and helped Rep. Nydia Velazquez in her initial, and successful, run for US Congress.
His journalism career started when a friend asked him to deliver occasional commentaries for a local Spanish-language TV station, and he discovered that "there was a market for his belligerence." In 1995, Borrero began writing full-time for El Diario/La Prensa, the largest Spanish-language newspaper in New York City.
Journalism.
Borrero's journalism has covered a broad spectrum of New York City life: particularly in the areas of government and politics, media, popular culture, and Latino and immigration issues. As editor-at-large of City &amp; State NY, Borrero researched and interviewed New York's top political leaders and influencers. He also serves on City &amp; State's editorial board, and leads their feature coverage of the annual Somos El Futuro legislative conference.
In 1996 he landed a column called "Bajo Fuego" ("Under Fire") in "El Diario/La Prensa." In announcing this new column, "El Diario" publisher Rossana Rosado declared that Borrero understood the city in a way that the paper's Latin America-trained reporters did not.
For nineteen years, from 1995 through 2014, "Bajo Fuego" was published thrice weekly in "El Diario/La Prensa". The column won several awards for its in-depth research, and its unique perspective on Latino life in New York.
For three years, from 2000 through 2003, Borrero also served as editor-in-chief of "El Diario."
Radio.
Borrero's "Bajo Fuego" column caught the attention of Radio WADO's management in New York City. They gave Borrero a sprawling three hours-per day, five days per week, talk show. New Yorkers enjoyed his brash, dramatic style of reporting and interviewing - and according to Arbitron ratings, the show's audience grew to 165,000 a week. "He's a very popular guy. He could make you, and he could break you," said New York State Senator Rubén Díaz Sr., who is also the father of Bronx Borough President Rubén Díaz Jr.
The show ran until 2001, and Borrero continued as a radio broadcaster for over twenty years.
He is also a frequent guest on the Brian Lehrer Show on WNYC.
Television.
Borrero is a political commentator for New York 1.
For over a decade he has appeared with WABC Radio's Curtis Sliwa on a weekly show, as part of the Time Warner Cable News program, "Inside City Hall".
This show, "Political Rundown", features Borrero and Sliwa squaring off over the week's top local, state and national news stories.
The segment, which airs each Wednesday and is moderated by political anchor Errol Louis, has been reported as a “must see” in New York political circles.
Borrero also appears as a cultural and political commentator on the Spanish-language channel of Time Warner/Spectrum. The program is called "Para Que Lo Sepas," and the TV channel is NY1 Noticias, a division of the Time Warner NY1 channel.
HITN.
HITN (Hispanic International Television Network) is the largest Latino public broadcaster in the United States.
In 2016, Borrero hosted a twelve-part educational TV series for HITN called "Tu Momento 21016." The twelve informational videos, all hosted by Borrero, provided a detailed yet easy-to-understand overview of the entire U.S. presidential electoral process - from candidacy to inauguration day. In this manner, from April through Election Day 2016, Borrero and HITN encouraged U.S. voter participation by educating the Spanish-speaking community, nationwide, about the complex U.S. electoral system.
Currently, Borrero conducts a weekly interview series for HITN called "Estudio DC con Gerson Borrero." It focuses on national political figures and Latino cultural leaders.
Family life.
Borrero is married to Ruth Noemí Colón, an attorney who was the 66th Secretary of State of New York.
Borrero has two adult children - Taína, 34, and Gerson Felipe, 20.

Anna Wintour (song)

"Anna Wintour" is a song recorded by American singer and rapper Azealia Banks. It was released on April 6, 2018 by eOne and Chaos &amp; Glory as the planned lead single from her mixtape "Fantasea II: The Second Wave". Production of the song was handled by Junior Sanchez, while the song was penned by Banks, Sanchez, Dorian Strickland, Kevin James, and "Shug". The song is named after Anna Wintour, who is the editor-in-chief of "Vogue", and is about self empowerment. The music video was released on May 24, 2018 and surpassed 1 million views in 48 hours.
Production.
While Banks was signed to Interscope Records, Junior Sanchez was commissioned by the label to do a remix of Banks's song "Ice Princess," from "Broke with Expensive Taste" (2014), with the working title of the track being "Anna Wintour". One of the initial plans for the song was for it to feature Mel B, however, this concept was ultimately scrapped due to scheduling conflicts. Another concept that Banks had envisioned for the song was for it to feature Nicki Minaj. When discussing her reasoning for the title of the song, Banks stated:
Critical reception.
Shaad D'Souza of the website "Noisey" stated, "The song is a fun, upbeat vogue track, and it features Azealia rapping and singing some of her sweetest lines ever. "I feel in love babe, I really know that your love is enough," she sings on the chorus, "I'm so lucky you found me in the day." It's beautiful! The song is called "Anna Wintour," I assume, because it's a vogue track, and Anna Wintour is the editor of Vogue. Wordplay! I'm feeling really positive about Fantasea II, and "Anna Wintour" is a great start to a new era for Azealia." Myles Tanzer of "The Fader" commented on Banks' vocals, stating: "...she hits soulful high notes in the pre-chorus, glides through a pop section with her trademark fluid delivery, screams over the song's breakdown, and even stops to rap a ferocious verse."
"Dazed" put "Anna Wintour" on its 20 best tracks of 2018 list, saying the song "showed, once again, that the rapper really knows how to make a dance floor anthem. Channeling the energy of Vogue’s iconic editor with the same glow she exhibits while “stuntin’ in front row”, “Anna Wintour” felt like it could have been a real comeback moment for Banks, marking an upwards artistic trajectory as she embarked on her new album." "The Line of Best Fit" placed it on 25th spot in its Fifty Best Songs of 2018, remarking that "its impossibly catchy 90s house beat plays host to both Banks’ powerful voice and unstoppable bars. It treads the pop/rap line in a way that no other artist is doing in 2018. It feels retro but not dated, and sticks to Banks’ signature sound without feeling too same-old."
"Pitchfork" ranked it on its 100 best songs of 2018 list, saying that "the rapper’s messy public persona yields the floor to a bracing showcase of her dexterity. She pulls triple duty as house diva, raging wraith, and cold-blooded killer, nailing each part and metabolizing Junior Sanchez’s fiercely generic Ibiza track into a raw energy source. “Anna Wintour” joins “Thank U, Next” and “Honey” among the few songs about self-love released this year that betray greater depth than vapid Instagram inspo, and it offers a reminder of what makes the often-frustrating Banks so great: Like this song’s namesake, she knows how to keep us looking."
Music video.
On May 24, 2018, Banks released the music video for "Anna Wintour". The video features Banks in and around an abandoned warehouse dancing and was directed by choreographer and long time backup dancer Matthew Pasterisa. Prior to the music video's release, Banks responded to accusations that her music video was too similar to Kanye West's 2016 video for "Fade", claiming that Teyana Taylor stole the choreography from Pasterisa and didn't give him credit until lawyers were involved. Taylor denied these claims and called on Pasterisa to comment, to which he said he wasn't directly involved with "Fade" but received credit regardless.

Reeves and Byrd and producer William Stephens had just made "Jungle Goddess" for Lippert and were signed for this follow up, originally called "Green Goddess". Filming started 15 August 1948. It was reported the film would be the first of 12 movies Stephens would make for Lippert "which is a hearty assignment for a moviemaker but apparently Stephens has a formula for production", according to the "Los Angeles Times".
Filming started 15 August 1948. It was shot at Nassour Studio.
Inspired by "Jungle Goddess", producer William Stephen announced he wanted to make four films a year starring Reeves and Byrd as a "Captain Flagg-Sgt Quinn sort of team", starting with this one. The second one would be "Banana Boat" by John Wilste. (Stephen was also going to make "Three Alarm Fire" by Arthur Caesar.) However conditions to film background scenes in South America, where "Banana Fleet" was set, were not ideal so instead Stephens made "Hell on Wheels" (which became "Highway 13", also based on a story by Wilste).
Golden Gate Pictures announced they were going to make a film with Greg McClure called "The Man from Back East" produced by William David. That may have turned into this film.

The Return of Wildfire

The Return of Wildfire, also known as Black Stallion, is a 1948 American film directed by Ray Taylor (director) and starring Richard Arlen.
Plot.
Pop Marlowe owns a horse ranch and his daughters help maintain it. Judy Marlow runs the ranch, and sister Pat helps with the chores. When Pat is injured while trying to capture the wild horse Wildfire, drifter Dobe Williams helps her get back home. Pat asks Pop to give Dobe a job, and in return he agrees to help Pat catch Wildfire. 
Frank Keller, the ranch foreman, has fallen on hard times after losing $6,000 at the local saloon owned by Marty Quinn. Knowing that Keller is courting Judy, and that the ranch has plenty of horses, Quinn tells Keller to buy about 500 head of the Marlowe's breeding stock to repay the debt. The problem is that Pop knows Quinn, and is aware that he only wants the horses so that he can monopolize the market and drive prices up. Quinn reminds Keller that should anything happen to Pop, that his girlfriend Judy will inherit the ranch.
As Pat and Dobe become closer, Wildfire frees all the ranch's herd, and the ranch hands must round up all the horses. During the round-up Keller beats Pop, trusting that the herd of rushing horses will kill him. In the aftermath Judy flirts with Dobe, Keller and Pat get jealous, and Judy agrees to sell the herd to Quinn. Dobe leaves town, but after Judy and Pat reconcile they head out after him to apologize. When Dobe asks the saloon owner to sell the horses back, Quinn gets angry and pistol whips him. Judy still wants to break Dobe and Pat up, but the pair work on catching and taming the wild herd of horses that Wildfire leads, and soon the ranch has 300 horses broken in. Quinn doesn't want those horses sold, and blackmails Keller with his knowledge of Pop Marlowe's murder. Keller gets all the ranch hands drunk to slow down the ranch's work at taming the wild horses. Dobe finds out that Quinn is trying to hire the ranch hands out from under the Marlows, forces the hands back to the ranch with his six-shooter, and sobers them up.
Quinn and his gang storm the ranch and Pat is injured in the raid. Quinn orders Keller to trap Wildfire so he won't lead the other horses out into the wild. When horse and man come face to face, Wildfire stomps Keller to death. Dobe then goes after Wildfire thinking he's herded the horses out into the wild, but Judy rushes to tell Dobe that Pat is recovering nicely, and that Quinn is actually the one who is responsible. Quinn eventually shoots and wounds Wildfire while Dobe is driving the herd back to the ranch. Dobe then goes after the bad guys and defeats them in a drawn out fight. As Wildfire recovers Judy stops interfering with Dobe and Pat. Wildfire is then released back to the wide open as Dobe and Pat more forward with their relationship.

I Hear a Song (album)

I Hear a Song is the fifth studio album by Australian recording artist Dami Im released on 23 March 2018 by Sony Music Australia. The album is made up of 12 cover songs and 2 original tracks. The album was announced on 16 February 2018 with Im saying “Before you listen to the album it might look like an unusual combination of songs but I recorded every tune with the same desire, which was to share the stories of these amazing women, the most raw and simple way, through a microphone and my fingers on the black and white keys." In April, Im said: "You wouldn't call it like a serious jazz record, but it has that flavour, it has all that vibe that I used to have before this pop thing came along."
The album was supported by the I Hear a Song Tour commencing in April 2018.
Reception.
Cameron Adams from "news.com.au" gave the album 3 out of 5 stars, writing: "While "The Carpenters" [cover album] made her sound old before her time, this one works well. Jazzy gems from everyone from Beyoncé to Nina Simone to Norah Jones to Bonnie Raitt. Two originals suggest Dami is more down with 'bebop' than 'dance pop' now." David from auspOp gave the album 4 out of 5, saying: ""I Hear a Song" is a successful outing featuring music that feels genuinely 'Dami'. This is a really cohesive and mature sounding album. It's not about big bold brash tunes, it's more in the subtlety of the arrangements in each song." He called "Come Away with Me" the album highlight.

Tinea argodelta

Tinea argodelta is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1915. However the placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as "Tinea" (s.l.) "argodelta". This species is endemic to New Zealand.
The wingspan is about 10 mm. The forewings are dark purple fuscous with two or three minute whitish strigulae on the costa towards one-third, a spot of white strigulation in the middle of the costa, a smaller spot at two-thirds, and three dots between this and the apex. There is a clear white triangular spot on the dorsum before the middle, reaching nearly half across the wing and a spot of whitish strigulation on the dorsum before the tornus, and two or three whitish scales towards the termen. The hindwings are dark purple-grey.

<doc id="56601894" url="?curid=56601894" title="Defence Act of 1925 (Sweden)">
Defence Act of 1925 (Sweden)

The Defence Act of 1925 was a defence act passed by the Swedish Riksdag on 26 May 1925 and came into force on 1 January 1928. The Act specified how the Swedish Armed Forces would operate during the coming years. The Act resulted in a policy of disarmament. The Act would remain effective until the Defence Act of 1936.
The new order of battle meant that the number of Army Divisions was decreased to 4. 17 military units were disbanded and conscription time was lowered to 140 days for most conscripts. Many conscripts were transferred to the Army Reserve. The Army and Naval air powers were combined into the Swedish Air Force.
Background.
The Edén Cabinet had in 1919 started an investigation into the Swedish Armed Forces in order to lower the high defence expenditure the Defence Act of 1914 had resulted in. The investigation concluded in 1923 and the right-wing majority had decided on an expenditure cap of 120 million Swedish crowns per year, 62 million less than the Defence Act of 1914 stipulated.
The political parties all made differing judgements on how large of a war force Sweden needed. The political right claimed that Russia represented a long-term threat to Sweden, and that Russia's political and economic troubles during the 1920s were just temporary. They also believed - due to Sweden's entry in to the League of Nations - that the risk of Sweden being dragged in to war had increased.
The liberal Free-minded National Association referred to the weakened powers of Germany and Russia, the creation of the League of Nations and the war exhaustion that many nations were suffering through as a result of the First World War. The Free-minded had major hopes for international treaties regarding disarmament.
The Social Democrats predicted a sustained and stable period of peace, which did not motivate a strong defence in order to counter surprise attacks. A war in Europe would be preceded by worsened international relations and thus give time for necessary rearmament. The Social Democrats believed that Sweden only needed to maintain neutrality in order to deflect foreign aggression.
The proposition on a future defence encountered multiple setbacks during its discussion in the Riksdag, but in 1925, the Social Democratic Sandler Cabinet agreed to a mainly Freeminder-backed proposal which involved a further decreased expenditure cap of 107 million crowns per year, equivalent to roughly 1,3 % of the Swedish GDP.
Reorganisation.
The construction of new ships was cut which resulted in the older ships not being replaced. In 1927, the Navy was starting to focus on lighter units in order to outnumber the heavier armoured cruisers.
The inner lines at Vaxholm Fortress, Älvsborg Fortress and Hemsö Fortress were returned to storage and the Älvsborg Coastal Artillery Regiment (KA 3), Hörningsholm Fortress and Luleå Coastal Position were dissolved.
The Swedish Air Force is formed as a separate military branch, through a merge of the air forces of the Army and Navy, consisting of 57 aircraft.
Disbanded military units.
Many units which remained received new unit designations, i.e. the Northern Småland Regiment became I 12.
Remaining military units.
The Act meant that the Swedish Army in peace time were to consist of the following units from 1 January 1928. One of the major changes was that the infantry regiments were to only consist of two battalions instead of three.

Dinero (Jennifer Lopez song)

"Dinero" is a song by American singer Jennifer Lopez featuring American record producer DJ Khaled and American rapper Cardi B. It was written by Charles Anderson, Tommy Brown, Mohombi Moupondo, Yei Gonzalez, Danielle Curiel, Alexander Prado, Jermaine Denny, DJ Khaled, Cardi B and Luis Kalaff, and produced by Scott Desmarais, Brown and DJ Khaled and co-produced by Moupondo and Gonzalez. "Dinero" was released on all digital and streaming platforms on May 17, 2018, by Epic Records. The song was nominated for Choice Latin Song at the 2018 Teen Choice Awards and its official music video received two nominations for Best Latin Video and Best Collaboration at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, winning the latter.
Background.
"Dinero" is Lopez's first English single since "Us". Lopez first heard "Dinero" in early 2017 when it was sent to her by Cory Rooney, a record producer with whom she had worked frequently in her early career, who felt that it would be good for her. She was receptive of the track, and in the months that followed suggested to her manager Benny Medina that rapper Cardi B be featured on the record. Lopez, who had followed Cardi B prior to her breakthrough with "Bodak Yellow", said: "I just thought she had a street intelligence that I liked, and she had a logic that just made me laugh and reminded me of girls from the Bronx." Later, record producer DJ Khaled offered to provide further production for "Dinero", and the song was finished by December 2017. That month, a video of Lopez and Khaled working together in the studio was posted to Instagram, which hinted that the singer had collaborated with Cardi B. A short snippet of the song surfaced online in January 2018, and Lopez subsequently confirmed that it was titled "Dinero" the following month. Khaled stated: "Everything's top secret, [but] I can tell you this: J.Lo's got some new music coming [...] I want to thank J.Lo for letting me be one of the producers amongst other great ones, and a feature on the record. I'm grateful."
Composition.
"Dinero" is a Latin trap song with a production that consists of synths, drums and an "occasional" acoustic guitar lick. "Dinero", which translates in English to "Money", features Lopez rapping. Lopez opens the song with the introduction: "Me and Benjamín Franco stay at the / Getting checks like Nike, everywhere that I go", and in the hook declares: "" ("I want, I want money"). Cardi B's verse includes the lyric: "Two bad bitches that came from the Bronx / Cardi from the pole and Jenny from the block", a reference to the Bronx, where both Lopez and Cardi originate from, and Cardi's former stripper career. Khaled can be heard throughout the track, acting as a hype man.
Critical reception.
Abby Jones of "Billboard" described "Dinero" as a "fiery proclamation of everyone's love for cold hard cash that's brimming with witty bilingual word play." "The Guardian" characterized the song as "a hustler's anthem", adding: "And not to mention the fact that J-Lo raps on this song with, 'They say money talk, but my talking bilingual', as her best bar." Similarly, "XXL" called it a "fiery anthem" and "potential banger". "Vogue" writer Michelle Ruiz praised the song as a potential summer hit, and felt that "Dinero" is "sort of like the 2018 answer" to Lopez's 2002 lead single from her third studio album titled "This Is Me... Then", "Jenny from the Block". Likewise, Mike Nied of "Idolator" opined that "'Dinero' could easily dominate the charts this summer", writing: "Khaled’s production grows under her voice and builds to a steady fizz that is sure to fill dance floors across the globe, and Cardi brings the fire for her verse."
Music video.
The music video for "Dinero" was shot in April 2018. In the clip that surfaced online in December 2017, Lopez and Khaled could be heard discussing a concept for the video, with Khaled noting that "The video idea is gonna make the record even more crazier." Lopez said: "It's cinematic. It has those themes. I was just trying to connect it to the song where it's just not the typical reggaeton, bachata, hip-hop video that everybody does all the time." Directed by Joseph Kahn, the music video was shot entirely in black-and-white. It was released on May 24, 2018. Lopez sported 13 different looks and wore US$4.5 million worth of jewelry from Tiffany &amp; Co.
"Slant Magazine" listed "Dinero" as one of the "100 Best Music Videos of the 2010s", with Alexa Camp writing that, "the black-and-white clip brazenly takes the piss out of Lopez’s dubious Jenny from the Block persona—and she’s clearly in on the joke, bowling with a diamond-covered ball, barbecuing in lingerie and pearls while sipping a crystal-encrusted Slurpee, toasting marshmallows over a burning pile of cash, and walking a preening pet ostrich on a leash."

Lopez first previewed the song during her set at Calibash in January 2018, which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. She included it as part of a dance medley with "Bitch Better Have My Money" by Rihanna and "Bodak Yellow" by Cardi B. Lopez officially performed "Dinero" for the first time at the 2018 "Billboard" Music Awards which took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 20. She wore a "bedazzled" bustier and white pants, later sporting a white blazer and fedora to complete the look. She was surrounded by a group of "'40s era gangster-styled dancers". Khaled, surrounded by piles of money, appeared on a separate stage to introduce Lopez; Cardi B was not present due to her pregnancy, but appeared via a black-and-white video. Leila Cobo of "Billboard" said the performance was "ridiculously fun to watch", calling it "a lot of bling, a lot of style, some kick-ass dancing (JLo does not disappoint) and a whole lotta cash flying around". "Refinery29" writer Kathryn Lindsay stated that "the multi-hyphenate proved she's going back to her roots with a passionate and colorful performance", but noted: "The one thing people didn't like about the performance? DJ Khaled. The artist was there, seemingly, to throw around money and yell some of his signature phrases during the song, but fans just wanted more J.Lo." Lopez and Khaled later performed "Dinero" as part of Lopez's medley during the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards on August 20, 2018 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, where she was also awarded the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. Lopez performed the song for "Today", at Rockefeller Plaza on May 6, 2019 in New York City as part of the shows Citi Concert Series. Lopez was the opening act and kicked off the event performing the song as part of a medley that also included "Medicine" (2019), "Jenny from the Block" (2002) and "On the Floor" (2011).

James William Mollison

James William Mollison (1858 – 1927) was a British specialist in agriculture who worked in the Bombay Presidency, where he served as director of agriculture before being appointed as the first inspector general of agriculture in India.
Mollison was born to James Mollison and Ann née Bisset in Inverness in 1858. With six other siblings, the family lived at Dochgarroch Lodge, Inverness between 1861 and 1871 and moved to Brunton House in Wiltshire around 1881.
Mollison moved to India, where he served as superintendent of the experimental farms in 1890 and was appointed technical director of agriculture for the Bombay Presidency in 1892. He published pamphlets on topics related to agriculture, writing on the cultivation of betel, cardamom and pepper in Kanara in 1900. In 1901 he was appointed inspector-general of agriculture, a position that was created after the visit of J.A. Voelcker. He published "A text-book on Indian Agriculture" in 1901 in three volumes. He also published notes on various agricultural issues in journals. He was invested as a Companion of the Order of the Star of India in 1911.
Mollison married Edith Mary, daughter of James McRae, a leather maker in Surrey, in 1901. They did not have children. They returned to England after his retirement and lived at Ascotts, Felbridge, Surrey. Mollison died in 1927.

Stephen Machin

Stephen Jonathan Machin (born 23 December 1962) is a British economist and professor of economics at the London School of Economics (LSE). Moreover, he is currently director of the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) and is a fellow of the British Academy, the Society of Labor Economists and the European Economic Association. His current research interests include labour market inequality, the economics of education, and the economics of crime.
Biography.
Stephen Machin earned a B.A. in economics from Wolverhampton Polytechnic in 1985 as well as a Ph.D. from the University of Warwick in 1988, wherein he analysed the impact of trade unions on economic performance. After his Ph.D., he worked first as a lecturer (1988–93), then as a reader (1993-96), and finally as professor of economics at University College London (1996-2016). Since 1994, Machin has repeatedly held positions at the Centre for Economic Performance (CEP) at the London School of Economics (LSE) before becoming CEP's director and accepting a professorship in economics at LSE in 2016. Additionally, Machin has served as director of the Centre for the Economics of Education at LSE (1999-2009) and held visiting appointments at Harvard University (1993–94) and at MIT (2001–02).
In terms of professional service and responsibilities, Stephen Machin is a member of the council of the Royal Economic Society, a fellow of the European Economic Association (EEA), Society of Labor Economists, and British Academy, and an editor of "Economica". In the past, Machin has been a council member of the EEA (2014–18), president of the Economics Section of the British Science Association (2013), a president of the European Association of Labour Economists (2009–11), and was an editor of the "Economic Journal" (1998-2013) and of the "International Journal of Industrial Organization" (1995–97).
Research.
Stephen Machin's research focuses on labour economics, the economics of education, the economics of crime, and industrial economics. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Machin belongs to the 1% of most-cited economists, in particular ranking 7th among education economists.
Labour economics.
In labour economics, main areas of Machin's research include minimum wages, trends in wage inequality and social mobility, and skill-biased technological change.
In the mid- and late 1990s, following David Card and Alan B. Krueger's re-evaluation of the employment effects of the minimum wage, Stephen Machin (with Alan Manning) conducted research in the U.K. on the subject. In general, they find that the decrease in the ratio between Britain's minimum wage and its average wage significantly contributed to growing wage dispersion in the 1980s but didn't increase employment, which in turn suggests that - with the possible exception of young workers - the minimum wage had either no or a small positive effect on employment. They further argue that this finding extends to other European countries for 1966-1996 and is in line with monopsonistic models of labour demand.
The rise in wage inequality in the United Kingdom from the late 1970s prompted Machin to research the subject, along with developments in intergenerational mobility. Among else, Machin (with Lorraine Dearden and Howard Reed) with finds that intergenerational mobility is low in Britain as upward mobility from the bottom of the wage distribution fails to compensate for the rigidity of downward mobility from its top. With regard to wage inequality, Machin, Costas Meghir and Amanda Gosling argue that the growth in British wage inequality in 1978-95 is mainly due to increases in the differences between returns to education and the persistently slow growth of entry level wages. Related to his work on the role of wage-education differentials, Machin has also conducted research on skill-biased technological change. In particular, he finds (with John van Reenen) that the relative demand for skilled workers increased throughout the 1970s and 1980s all across the OECD (and not only in the U.S.) as technical change required workers to upgrade their skills and shows (with Eli Berman and John Bound) that the larger the skill-biased technological change is, the larger its potential to depress the relative wages of less-skilled workers, thus resulting in higher wage inequality.
Economics of education.
In the economics of education, Machin's research ranges from the effect of school quality on property prices, trends in educational inequality, the impacts of school choice, school competition, and ICT in primary education on student achievement to education policy. With Stephen Gibbons, he finds that a 10pp increase in a British neighbourhood in the share of children reaching the grade corresponding to their age increases the neighbourhood's property prices by 6.7%, implying that society values improved primary school performance by up to GBP 90 per year and per child at 2000 property prices. In research with Jo Blanden on educational inequality in the UK, Machin finds that the expansion of British higher education from the 1970s to 1990s has disproportionately benefited children from relatively richer backgrounds and widened participation gaps between rich and poor children. Addressing methodological shortcomings in the earlier literatures, Machin, Gibbons, Sandra McNally and Olmo Silva use IV estimations to study the impact of new technology in British primary schools, of increased school choice for students and of stronger competition between schools on student achievement, and find a positive impact for ICT investments, though generally no or only very limited effects for school choice and competition.
Economics of crime.
A more recent area of Machin's research has been the economics of crime. In particular, Machin and Meghir find a strong negative link between low-skilled workers' wages and crime rates, as well as important effects for crime deterrents and returns to crime, thus further emphasizing the importance of economic incentives for crime. Exploiting changes in compulsory schooling laws in the UK through a regression discontinuity design, Machin, Olivier Marie and Suncica Vujic find that education can substantially reduce (property) crime rates. Finally, Machin, Brian Bell and Francesco Fasani find that the influx of asylum seekers into the UK in the late 1990s and early 2000s modestly increased property crime, whereas the influx of immigrants from eastern European EU members decreased it property crime, with immigration having no effect on violent crime in either case, thus underlining the importance of labour market opportunities as a means to reduce crime rates.
Industrial and urban economics.
Investigating the impact of developing an innovation on British corporations' profitability, Machin, van Reenen and Paul Geroski observe that the indirect effects of innovation on profits due to innovation signalling firms' internal commitment to improving their competitiveness are up to three times as large as the direct effect of producing a new product or using a new, more efficient production process. Around the same time, Machin (with Paul Gregg and Stefan Szymanski) also studied the vanishing relation between directors' pay and their firms performance over the 1980s and early 1990s, finding that directors' pay became completely disconnected from corporate performance around 1988 and was instead driven by corporate growth. Finally, Machin and Gibbons pioneered a new approach to estimating consumers' valuation of rail access through housing prices, finding that local households significantly valued the construction of new stations in the context of improvements to the London Underground and Docklands Light Railway in South East London in the late 1990s.

Tinea astraea

Tinea astraea is a species of moth in the family Tineidae. It was described by Edward Meyrick in 1911. However the placement of this species within the genus "Tinea" is in doubt. As a result, this species has been referred to as "Tinea" (s.l.) "astraea". This species is endemic to New Zealand.
The wingspan is about 12 mm. The forewings are blackish, the apical two-fifths bronzy fuscous, and with five fine white longitudinal lines from the base in the disc, the second and third reaching to near the middle, the others shorter. There are two very short white marks on the costa near the base and pairs of oblique white streaks from the costa at one-fourth and the middle, reaching half across the wing. There are also pairs of short broken ochreous-whitish streaks from the dorsum at one-fourth and one-half and the posterior area has four or five less-oblique diminishing white streaks from the costa, and three iridescent silvery-whitish from the tornus and termen, nearly meeting in the disc. The hindwings are grey, with purplish reflections.

Bath College (English public school)

Bath College was an English public school in Bath, Somerset, in existence from 1878 to 1909. It was founded by Thomas William Dunn (1837–1930), previously an assistant master at Clifton College, who was headmaster from 1878 to 1897.
The school's premises were on North Road, Bath. They had been built in 1835, as a private residence for Augustus Andrew who had been an army officer in India, named "Vellore House", to a design by John Pinch the younger. A later owner was the Rev. Charles Kemble, who died in 1874.
In 1890 a chapel was erected at Bath College and was opened by the Lord Bishop in May of that year. The chapel building was built on the old playground adjoining the Head Master's residence and was in the Grecian style of architecture to correspond with the front of the College and Head Master's residence. Following the school's closure many of the pews from the chapel were installed to provide additional seating in St Luke's Church, South Lyncombe in 1913 and the pulpit and reading desk from the chapel were donated to St Phillip's Mission Church, Odd Down in 1914.
The school closed down in 1909, and subsequently the building was sold and refurbished, opening as the Bath Hydro Hotel in 1913. By 1914 the directors of the hotel decided that the name was misleading and changed it to become the Bath Spa Hotel.

Texas Manhunt

Texas Manhunt, also known as Red Desert, is a 1949 American film directed by Ford Beebe and starring Don "Red" Barry and Tom Neal.
Producer.
The film stars Margia Dean, who recalled "Don Barry was very nice, pleasant and polite to me. But, he was short. And that can create something of a problem. Tom Neal was in it, and I found him to be the serious, brooding type." She says Holt was in the film because producer Robert L Lippert "was good about using once-big names who were a little past their prime!... It was my first leading lady, but still a thankless part. You go in early in the morning for hair and makeup; then are driven a long ways to a dusty, hot, sticky location. At dusk, they take the leading lady's close-up—just when she's grimy! (Laughs) Those tight corsets and five pounds of wigs were all uncomfortable—as were those stagecoach rides—which were so bumpy! (Laughs)".

2018 PBA All-Star Week

The 2018 PBA All-Star Week is the annual all-star week of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA)'s 2017–18 season being held on May 23 to 27, 2018 on three different venues covering Luzon (Batangas), Visayas (Iloilo) and Mindanao (Davao).
Luzon leg.
Obstacle Challenge.
This edition was exclusively only for big men (power forwards and centers).
Gabby Espinas replaced Yancy de Ocampo, who was unable to participate.
Three-Point Shootout.
This year's shootout featured a new format. Each of the five racks now has two moneyballs, with the first and fifth balls being valued as two points. This was a departure from the previous years' feature of having an "all-moneyball rack". This also increased the maximum possible points to 35 from 34.
Slam Dunk Contest.
This year's contest only featured four judges instead of the traditional five.
Logo making contest.
The league launched a logo-making contest for the All-Star week on February 23, 2018. The winner of the contest will win an all-expense-paid trip for two to one of the All-Star week legs (Davao, Batangas or Iloilo).
On March 15, an entry by John Paul Limos was selected as the winner of the contest by a selection committee composed of Commissioner Willie Marcial, PBA Press Corps president Gerry Ramos and Magnolia Hotshots team manager Alvin Patrimonio. The winning entry however got disqualified the following day since the logo had a very similar look from the logo used by PlayPark All-Stars (an e-sports tournament).
On March 19, a new logo, designed by Jerome Allan Moreno was selected as the winner of the logo making contest.

Bainbridge-Ropers Syndrome

Bainbridge-Ropers syndrome is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities including severe psychomotor development, feeding problems, severe postnatal growth delays, intellectual disabilities, and skeletal abnormalities.
Signs and symptoms.
Morphological features of this syndrome include:
Genetics.
This condition is caused by a mutation in the ASXL3 gene, which is considered a de novo mutation.
Genetic changes that are described as "de novo" (new) mutations can be either hereditary or somatic. In some cases, the mutation occurs in a person's egg or sperm cell but is not present in any of the person's other cells. In other cases, the mutation occurs in the fertilized egg shortly after the egg and sperm cells unite. (It is often impossible to tell exactly when a de novo mutation happened.) As the fertilized egg divides, each resulting cell in the growing embryo will have the mutation. De novo mutations may explain genetic disorders in which an affected child has a mutation in every cell in the body but the parents do not, and there is no family history of the disorder.
This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. 
Mutations in the Additional Sex Combs Like 3 (ASXL3) gene on the long arm of chromosome 18 (18q12.1) have been associated with this condition.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis can only be made by genetic testing. 
Differential diagnosis.
Bohring-Opitz syndrome
Treatment.
There is no currently known treatment or cure for this condition. However, the symptoms can be treated.
History.
This condition was first described by Bainbridge "et al" in 2013.

Robin DR100

The Robin DR100 series is a family of French light aircraft made by Pierre Robin, which first flew in 1958. Of wooden construction, it has tailwheel undercarriage and 2+2 seating; as a development of Jodel aircraft, its wings feature the same distinctive marked outboard dihedral. Whilst no longer produced, plans can be purchased for amateur construction.
Design and development.
The first aircraft of the line was the ‘Jodel-Robin’ of amateur construction, which was essentially a larger three-seater Bébé Jodel. It had the fuselage from a D11, and the wings from Jean Delemontez’s D10 project which were given to Pierre Robin. To commercialise the concept, a DR100 prototype was then built at Dijon-Darois in 1959, followed by ten of the DR100A production model, initially for testing and feedback from local customers. The DR105A aircraft were fitted with air brakes. The later 1050 ‘Ambassadeur’ models further improved upon this design, cruising at 200 km/h for 19l/h fuel burn. Robin set up CEA, Centre Est Aéronatique, to manufacture the aircraft, and later on also subcontracted to SAN, Société Aéronautique Normande, in order to fulfil demand. 790 were made in total: 331 by CEA and 459 by SAN; more have been made as homebuilts
Air races.
In the 1961 Sicily Air Races, Ambassadeurs finished in 2nd, 11th, 13th, 14th and 15th places, and finished the 1962 Paris-Cannes race in all three podium positions. As a result, Pierre Robin wanted to win the next year's Sicily Air Race and further honed the design to create the Ambassadeur ‘Sicile’. This improved design resulted in Pierre Robin's personal aircraft winning, and a total of seven Siciles in the top ten. The aircraft also finished first in the following year's Paris-Cannes
To celebrate this the design was further improved in 1963 and named the Sicile-Record. Slightly lighter and more streamlined it flew 10 km/h faster; Robin's plane winning the 1964 Sicily ‘Giro’ with ten Sicile-Records in the top twelve positions.

Deebo Samuel

Tyshun Raequan "Deebo" Samuel (born January 15, 1996) is an American football wide receiver for the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at South Carolina and was drafted by the 49ers in the second round of the 2019 NFL Draft.
Early years.
Samuel attended Chapman High School in Inman, South Carolina, where he played high school football and was coached by Mark Hodge. As a senior, he led his team to the Semifinals of the AAA playoffs. He had 166 catches for 2,751 yards and 36 touchdowns during his career, he rushed 133 times for 898 yards and scored 13 touchdowns, he finished with a record of 53 career touchdowns, he also had 94 tackles and 12 interceptions. He won the High School Sports Report Class AAA Offensive Player of the Year, and played in the Shrine Bowl of the Carolinas. Samuel was rated as a three-star recruit, by the 247 composite. He committed to the University of South Carolina to play college football.
College career.
2014 season.
Samuel redshirted in his true freshman year of 2014.
2015 season.
Samuel played in five games total, making three starts and struggling with injuries. He suffered a hamstring injury in the season opener against North Carolina. Deebo finished the season with 12 receptions for 161 yards.
2016 season.
In his sophomore season, Samuel played in 10 games and led the team with 59 receptions for 783 yards, he also rushed 15 times for 98 yards and six touchdowns. In the Birmingham Bowl against USF, he had 14 receptions for 190 receiving yards.
2017 season.
In the first game of the season against NC State, Samuel had five catches for 83 yards, for two touchdowns and also returned the opening kickoff back for a touchdown. In Week 2 against Missouri, Samuel once again returned a kickoff for a touchdown, and finished with five catches for 45 yards, and also ran the ball two times for 30 yards and a touchdown. In Week 3 against Kentucky, on the first play from scrimmage Samuel caught a 68-yard touchdown pass from Gamecock quarterback Jake Bentley. After suffering a season-ending injury later in the game, Samuel would finish the season having not even played three full games, yet accumulated 250 yards receiving for three touchdowns, two carries for 30 yards and a touchdown, and two kickoff returns for two touchdowns for a combined 194 yards.
Injury.
In Week 3 against Kentucky, with 2:27 left in the third quarter, Samuel caught a pass from Jake Bentley and was awkwardly tackled by no. 8 Derrick Baity Jr. of Kentucky, bending his leg back. It was announced after the game by head coach Will Muschamp that Samuel had broken his right fibula and would miss the rest of the season.

Public Administration School of Catalonia

The Public Administration School of Catalonia is a public organisation, founded in 1912 by Enric Prat de la Riba, currently falls under the Ministry of Governance and Public Administration of the Generalitat of Catalonia. At that time, it was the second European school dedicated to research and training in the field of public administration. The first one was settled in Düsseldorf.
Practical and professional training was the main objective for Regenerationism of that time, as well as knowledge in legal and administrative affairs. It was necessary to get public servants trained in all professional fields and adapt the educational system to the new productive needs of the Catalan industrial process and the new local policy, as a means to achieve the cohesion of the Catalan territory.
History.
In the first report on the proposal for the creation of the Commonwealth of Catalonia, the convenience of creating a school of civil servants was advocated to provided them with basic knowledge on administrative law and accountability for municipalities. This was reflected in the functioning of the public administrations of the industrialized countries of Europe. In parallel to the training given at the School from 1914, whose director was Isidre Lloret i Massaguer, civil servant of Barcelona City Council and professor of municipal law, the School organized the "municipal weeks", which were celebrated every year and important issues for the councils were discussed.
In 1924 - under the name of School of Administration - it was closed by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera and was reopened in 1930 under the name of Public Administration School. Once the Republican Generalitat was established, and until 1939, it became the Public Administration School of the Generalitat of Catalonia.
In 1979, the institution was restored under the current name. Nowadays, its strategic guidelines are:
In 2012, the School was rewarded with the St. George's Cross.

Tim Storer

Timothy Raphael Storer (born 24 October 1969) is a former Australian politician who served as a Senator for South Australia from February 2018 to June 2019. Following the disqualification of Skye Kakoschke-Moore during the parliamentary eligibility crisis, the Court of Disputed Returns declared Storer elected on a countback. He had been ranked below Kakoschke-Moore on the Nick Xenophon Team's ticket at the 2016 federal election. However, by the time he was declared elected he had left the party. He sat in the Senate as an independent and did not recontest his seat at the 2019 election.
Early life.
Storer was born in Loxton, South Australia one of five children of GP Brian Storer and school teacher Jennifer Storer. He studied economics at Adelaide University and was dux of his cohort in the Master of Business Administration at the Australian National University.
Business career.
Storer has been active in state branches of the Australia China Business Council and the Australian Republic Movement. A fluent speaker of Mandarin Chinese, Storer ran a sole proprietorship helping South Australian businesses with Asian trade and investment, having spent twenty years working in China, Hong Kong, and Vietnam from the early 1990s.
Political career.
From 1996 Storer was a member of the ALP in New South Wales for more than five years before his membership lapsed in 2002. He rejoined the party's Adelaide branch in South Australia in 2013, but quit his party membership in 2015. He characterises each bout of Labor Party membership as being motivated by a desire to promote an Australian republic.
He was the Nick Xenophon Team's fourth and final Senate candidate in South Australia at the 2016 election, which saw the three NXT candidates above Storer elected, two of whom resigned in late 2017. When party leader Nick Xenophon resigned in October 2017, intending to appoint staffer Rex Patrick as his successor, Storer wrote to the Parliament of South Australia claiming he held the right to fill the casual vacancy. One week later, Storer withdrew the challenge and resigned from the party.
NXT Senator Skye Kakoschke-Moore resigned in November 2017 after confirming that she held British citizenship, becoming a casualty of the dual citizenship crisis. The High Court of Australia held that she was invalidly elected, but delayed announcing her successor since the only other candidate on the party list, Storer, had left the party. In February 2018, following a challenge by Kakoschke-Moore to reclaim her seat having renounced her foreign citizenship, the High Court appointed Storer as a senator.
Storer did not support the Coalition's proposed corporate tax cut, later saying that one of his key goals was to increase the Newstart Allowance.
He launched and chaired a parliamentary committee into electric vehicles in Australia， reporting bi-partisan agreed recommendations.
Storer's First Speech outlined four guiding principles of integrity, fairness, prosperity and sustainability, with legislation evaluated on basis of evidence, with no side-deals on unrelated issues. 
Storer was an innovative and vocal transparency advocate, pursuing a number of initiatives to increase the accountability of and public confidence in our national government. 
Storer also introduced Private Senators Bills on Establishment of Social Security Commission, Improving Energy Efficiency in Rental Properties, EPBC Great Australian Bight, and Appointment of ABC Directors. He served on the Select Committee into the Obesity Epidemic and other Senate Inquiries on corporate tax proposals, personal income tax proposals, the ABC’s governance and allegations of political interference, Australia’s energy system, and the Murray Darling Basin Plan. 
Storer announced his retirement from politics in April 2019.
Tim Storer Independent SA Party.
Storer submitted an application to register the Tim Storer Independent SA Party. As he was a sitting member of parliament, the party did not require a minimum number of members. The Australian Electoral Commission published a notice on 15 June 2018 calling for any objections to registration of the party to be submitted by 15 July 2018. The associated constitution of the party sets out its guiding principles in section 3. The party was registered on 30 August 2018. It did not stand any candidates in the 2019 Australian federal election, as Storer had announced his intention to retire from politics.
Storer did not support the 26% emissions reduction target of the National Energy Guarantee, arguing that as it is cheap to reduce emissions in the electricity sector, the target should be higher.

Richard Evans (South African cricketer)

Richard James Evans (11 October 1914 – 29 May 1943) was a South African cricketer who played first-class cricket for Border from 1934 to 1940. 
Richard Evans was a leg-spin and googly bowler who had an exceptional career strike-rate: a wicket every 31.48 deliveries. He had an outstanding season for Border in 1937-38 when he was 23. In the first match, against Western Province, he took 5 for 72 and 4 for 92, and Border won by seven wickets. Then, in Border’s innings victory over Eastern Province he took 4 for 50 and 6 for 40. Later, in the victory over Orange Free State, he took 5 for 27 and 2 for 28, and a week after that, in the loss to Transvaal, he took 2 for 29 and 8 for 64. He finished the season with 36 wickets in five matches off 867 balls at a bowling average of 13.11 and a strike-rate of a wicket every 24.08 balls. Only Norman Gordon of Transvaal, with 39 wickets off 1798 balls, took more wickets in the season. 
However, Evans's considerable promise was unfulfilled. He played only two more first-class matches before the Second World War, in which he died at sea off Cape Town, aged 28. He died while serving in the South African Air Force when his Avro Anson stalled and crashed into the sea off Danger Point.

The vibe is all about innocence and mischievousness. She then gets ready for the union in a red outfit to depict passion and positive energy," she elaborates. The models can be seen dressed in pieces from her latest collection that are as classic as they are breezy and versatile.

Crossing Bayabas National High School

Crossing Bayabas National High School (Filipino: "Mataas na Paaralang Pambansa ng" Crossing Bayabas) is a public secondary school in Toril, Davao City, Davao Del Sur, Philippines, conceived on November 22, 1997, following the approval of the Republic Act No. 8388 authored by the late Congressman Elias B. Lopez.
After decades of being an annex school of "Doña Carmen Denia" National High School, the school finally operated on its own and paved the way for significant developments.
History.
Establishment.
In 1967, the school was created with the name "Piedad Barangay High School". The school was known to have preserving, dedicated, committed, and self-disciplined students and teachers that encouraged the community and its neighboring areas to make it their choice of preference for their children's education.
In the school year from 1979 to 1980, the school experienced much growth and development. The higher authorities of DECS decided to send a secondary school head as the administrator. At that time, the school management was implemented.
Educational and political leaders in a conference decided to look for a new school site in addition to the already crowded Piedad Barangay High School.
Political support.
On 5 March 1982, Don Luis D. Denia donated a portion of his land located at the Poblacion of Toril, Davao City. By this time, there were two campuses occupied by Piedad Barangay High School:
Modification.
On 10 September 1982, the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) of Piedad Barangay High School approved a Resolution No. 21, series of 1982, requesting that the school's name must be changed to "Doña Carmen Denia City High School" due to some important justifications.
Moreover, the PTA Resolution No. 21 was unanimously approved by the 24 Board of Directors who were present at that time. The first endorsement to the "Sangguniang Panglungsod" was on 19 February 1983, recommending the approval of the request upon.
Additional teachers were assigned to teaching, including charity teachers, but were eventually absorbed as permanent teachers. On 11 November 1987, the change of name from Piedad Barangay High School was approved under the City Council Resolution No. 601 during the 1987-1988 school year. The Republic Act No. 6746 approved the change of the school name by Congress on August 11, 1989.
The late Honorable Congressman Elias B. Lopez was responsible for all the legal works in the acquisition and development of the school site together with political and educational leaders in the community.
The Fourth Year Curriculum with a total of 668 students with 13 sections moved to the new school site on November 19, 1985, which partly decongested the old campus. The two secondary schools were managed by one school administrator.
Separation.
It was then followed by a conference called by the late Honorable Congressman Elias B. Lopez where a decision was made to separate the operation, management, and administration of the two schools. The old Piedad Barangay High School must be renamed since it is located at the Barangay of Crossing Bayabas.
Crossing Bayabas Barangay Council unanimously agreed to the proposal to change the name. The Republic Act No. 8388 approved on 22 November 1997, legalized the separation of the two schools and changed the name from Piedad Barangay High School to Crossing Bayabas National High School. The 1993-1994 school year was the turning point of the proposed separation of the two secondary schools.
Leadership.
Mrs. Lily D. Tongcaling.
The construction of school buildings under the supervision of Tongcaling, the first school principal, who had spent 16 years in the management of the school; and has undergone massive improvements in terms of physical and human resources.

Several teachers were also hired to cater the increasing school population.
Before Tongcaling transferred to another station in 2012, she worked on the requirements for the construction of a three-storey building.
Mrs. Evelyn E. Magno.
On August 15, 2012, the school was under new leadership when Magno took the management. During her active and dynamic leadership, the school opened opportunities to those working youth who wish to pursue their secondary education by offering the Sunday High School Program.
Several developments have taken place during her administration. The two-storey wooden structure was demolished and replaced with a concrete three-storey classroom building. The installations of Closed-circuit Television (CCTV) cameras and the school's paging system have significantly contributed to the improvements of school's service to its clients. Several teachers were also hired during her leadership.
Dr. Johnito O. Galan.
When Magno transferred to another station in 2014, Galan assumed the administration of the school. He strengthened the implementation of the Solid Waste Management Act (Republic Act No. 9003). Under his supervision, the school acquired an electrical laboratory funded by the Davao Light and Power Company. This is in preparation for the school's TechVoc offering when the K to 12 Senior High School Curriculum will be implemented. New constructions were also done during his leadership; new covered court was built and the canteen was renovated.

FS Class 741 II

The Ferrovie dello Stato (FS; Italian State Railways) Class 741 is a class of 2-8-0 'Consolidation' steam locomotives, rebuilds from the FS Class 740 with a Franco-Crosti boiler; it was the last class of steam locomotives introduced in Italy.
Design.
From 1940 the FS had experimented with the Franco-Crosti boiler, and after World War II it had been applied to several locomotives, including 90 Class 740 which were subsequently reclassified as Class 743. These rebuilds all had the preheater arranged in two barrels placed on the sides of the boiler; this arrangement had the disadvantage of subsequently increasing the axle load (therefore restricting route availability) and stretching the loading gauge to the limit, and precluded similar attempts from interested parties such as the British Railways.
An alternative arrangement had been experimented by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1952 on two DRB Class 42 locomotives, in which the barrels were placed below the boiler, which had been appropriately raised. To accede to BR's entreaties, the "Società Franco" studied a similar concept to transform a Class 740 with a single preheater barrel, and a single chimney placed on the right side of the locomotive, to test the concept (which would eventually lead to the ten Franco-Crosti BR Standard Class 9F locomotives). This concept was also interesting for the FS, as it promised to keep down the axle load, while keeping the system's fuel savings. To keep down the cost of transformations, the boiler was left largely unmodified, and only an exhaust steam injector was fitted.
Rebuilds.
The first locomotive was outshopped from the Verona Porta Vescovo workshop in 1954, and was originally classified as Class 743.433; tests showed that the locomotive's performance was practically the same of the two-barreled Franco-Crosti 743, having a power output of at , to the Class 740's at the same speed, while enjoying a greater route availability. Therefore, in 1958 the FS approved the transformation of a batch of 80 Class 740 locomotives, which were subsequently reclassified as Class 741 (the 743.433 was likewise reclassified as 741.433).
Service.
The Class 741 locomotives mainly operated in Sicily and in Veneto; they notably operated on the Pustertal line, renowned among enthusiasts as one of the last Italian lines where steam locomotives were in regular service, up to the latter half of the 1970s. Withdrawals began in 1968, and ended in the early 1980s.
Preservation.
Two Class 741 locomotives were preserved:

Houston's First Sit-in March 4, 1960

Houston's first sit-in was held Friday, March 4, 1960 at the Weingarten's grocery store lunch counter located at 4110 Almeda Road in Houston, Texas. This sit-in was a nonviolent, direct action protest led by more than a dozen Texas Southern University students. The sit-in was organized to protest Houston's legal segregation laws. The students met on Texas Southern University's campus and the YMCA located on Wheeler Street to organize the sit-in. They called their meetings 'war room' sessions. In these sessions, the students strategized like a military unit on how they would dismantle Houston's disenfranchisement laws. They believed that their peaceful approach was a tactic that would break Houston's discriminatory practices. It worked. The students called themselves the Progressive Youth Association (PYA). PYA was formed to address the social, political and economic issues that African-Americans faced in Houston. The Houston collegians were inspired by students at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University, who held a sit-in in Greensboro, North Carolina on February 1, 1960.
On the day of the Houston sit-in, the students met at a flag pole located at Hannah Hall on TSU's campus. They said a prayer; lined up in pairs, and begin to march to the Weingarten's lunch counter. As they marched down Wheeler Street, people along the route noticed. Others joined in the rally as the students marched down the street. Upon arriving at Weingarten's, the students went into the store and sat at the lunch counter. Eldrewey Stearns, the leader, called the police to alert them about the sit-in. It was a strategy Stearns hoped with would ensure the protest would remain peaceful. Customers and employees hurled insults at them. They were never served. However, this did not deter the students from holding sit-ins at other segregated businesses in Houston.
As a result of the students' actions, Houston leaders, black and white, met behind closed doors to discuss how to peacefully desegregate Houston. The students were unaware of the meetings. Media blackouts were held by white owned media about the students' initiatives to end racial segregation in Houston. However, not long after the students held the March 4 sit-in, Houston businesses quietly desegregated. The revolutionary actions of TSU students and others at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) played a role in the U.S. ultimately signing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 into law.
Fifty years later, Serbino Sandifer-Walker, a journalism professor at the same university, organized a march with the original students, current students, city leaders, state leaders, and many others to commemorate this historic day. A U.S. post office now sits at the location. However, a Texas Historical Marker sits in the front of the facility to commemorate the courageous Texas Southern University students who led that first sit-in, which played a major role in the desegregation of Houston, Texas.

The Bacher Lay is a nature reserve in Germany, which covers an area of 44.7 hectares in the county of Westerwaldkreis in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is a geotope of the Westerwald-Lahn-Taunus Geopark
Location.
The Bacher Lay is a disused basalt quarry, which is situated between Bad Marienberg and Nisterau on the Black Nister, a tributary of the Great Nister. Its name is derived from the formerly independent hamlet of "Bach", now part of the municipality of Nisterau; "lay" in this instance means 'quarry'. The area lies within parts of the parishes ("Gemarkungen") of Bad Marienberg, Bach, Eichenstruth and Stockhausen-Illfurth.
The Bacher Lay is characterised by a mighty, almost vertical, basalt rock face, which was produced as a result of basalt quarrying. The nearby "Pfaffenmal", an 18-metre-high columnar basalt cone which looks like a charcoal burner's pile, is also worth seeing.
From the town centre of Bad Marienberg to the Bacher Lay it is about 4 kilometres on foot.

Ganja Fortress

Fortress of Ganja (), is a fortress in Ganja, Azerbaijan. The remains of walls of the fortress can be seen in the territory of the oldest park of the city, Khan's Garden and in the entrance to the city, along the Ganja River.
History.
Farhad Pasha who headed the Turkish army in the Caucasus went to Ganja, controlled by the Safavids, by the order of Sultan Murad III. Ganja was captured on September 1, 1588. After taking Ganja, on 3 September 1588, Farhad Pasha ordered the construction of the castle 7-8 kilometers from the city. About forty days later the castle was built 2.3 km in length and 6 m in height 1.8 m in thickness of the walls. It was built in a flat area and was built on the left bank of the Ganja River. Ganja, where divided into 4 parts with the fortress in XVI century, consisted of four parts: Outer city, Shahristan, Ichgala and Naringala.
In 1868, after Ganja became the regional center of the Caucasus a new master plan of the city was prepared by architect Ignati Kshishtalovic. After the master plan approved in 1873 by Alexander II, walls of the fortress were demolished and European-styled neighborhoods were built. At present, a very small part of the Ganja fortress, Shiralibey tower remains. In 2007, restoration works were carried out on this fortress wall.
Architectural features.
While building the castle, some neighborhoods of Ganja were kept outside the walls of the fortress. It was built in an uneven polygonal shape. In the construction of the fortress, clay-mud, cobblestones and baked red bricks which is traditional Ganja architecture, were used. For that reason Its south-west, north-west, and north-east walls were strong. The total length and height were 13.7 km and 12 m respectively. A total of 30 defensive towers were built across the wall every 200 to 500 meters.
At certain height of the fortress walls, embrasures and watchtowers were constructed. They were important to use to attack the enemy. From those places, local fighters used to spill boiling oil and lubricant on attacking enemies.

Denis McDaid

Monsignor Dr Denis McDaid (1899 - 1981) was an Irish Roman Catholic clergyman who served as Rector of the Pontifical Irish College from 1939 - 1951 and thereafter was a Canon of St. Peter's Basilica. He is buried in Campo Verano in Rome.
Monsignor Dr Denis McDaid was educated in St Columb's College and studied for the priesthood in Rome and was ordained a priest for service in the Diocese of Derry in 1922. He undertook doctoral studies in Rome and then spent four years in the Archdiocese of Glasgow before an 8 years stint as a curate in Leckpatrick and a further curacy in Kilrea in 1936/
He was appointed Seminary Rector in early 1939.
The historian Dermot Keogh provides valuable insight into McDaid's character in his book on Ireland and the Vatican where he assesses MacDaid to have been "reserved, formal and not a little pedantic" and that it was a pity other stronger candidates were not offered the post.
McDaid's nationalist sentiments caused some unease to Irish diplomats who wished that in the context of the German occupation of Rome during the Second World War, MacDaid would speak less in public and "attend to his own business." McDaid later wrote an account of the College during the war years which was published in the College magazine The Coelian in 1968.

The Westerwald-Lahn-Taunus National Geopark () is a community initiative by the counties of Altenkirchen, Lahn-Dill, Limburg-Weilburg, Westerwald and Marburg-Biedenkopf. The geopark, which covers an area of 3,846 km², lies within parts of the German states of Hesse and Rhineland-Palatinate and within the natural region of the German Central Uplands.
The geopark is primarily a 'geopark of raw materials' ("Geopark der Rohstoffe") and is characterised by the diversity of mineral resources that occur here. From prehistoric times to the present day, mining and the processing of raw materials played an important role for the people of the region. Working with marble, stone and iron as well as clay was the basis for its prosperous economic and cultural development and at the same time the central theme that runs through the entire geopark.
On 8 November 2012, the Westerwald-Lahn-Taunus Geopark was certified as a 'national geopark'.

Coast Guard Goal 2030

Coast Guard Goal 2030 is a planned modernization program for the Bangladesh Coast Guard. The goal includes increasing manpower, purchasing more ships, hovercraft, helicopters, UAVs, maritime patrol aircraft and adding new generation surveillance technologies. The vision of the goal is for the Bangladesh Coast Guard to be a technologically advanced two-dimensional force that is capable of protecting the coastal area of Bangladesh well. Additionally, it will assist the Bangladesh Navy in case of any national emergency.
Plans and developments.
The total development plans under the Coast Guard Goal 2030 has been divided into three phases: the short term form 2015 to 2020, the medium term from 2021 - 2025 and the long term from 2026 - 2030.
Short term (2015 — 2020).
As per the short-term plan, the manpower of the force will be increased from 3,305 to 6,197. The organization of the force will be updated. Currently coast guard runs under three zonal headquarters. The coast guard will have three branches, six directorates, three regional headquarters and two more zonal headquarters within 2020. Four composite stations and one hospital will also be set up within this period.
The coast guard has purchased four s from Italy which were later refurbished and transformed into offshore patrol vessels which are currently known as Leader-class offshore patrol vessel. The original sensors and armaments were removed from the ship and replaced by Bangladesh Coast Guard requirements. They are currently armed with one Oerlikon KBA 25mm gun. Already two vessels are in service and the remaining two were delivered in December 2017. Contract has been signed with Khulna Shipyard for three Padma class "Inshore Patrol Vessels" in 2016. Separate contracts has been signed with Dockyard and Engineering Works Limited for the construction of two Shobuj Bangla class "Inshore Patrol Vessels" two 52 m "Inshore Patrol Vessels" and two 43 m "Fast Patrol Boats". Within 2020, the force plans to buy four more "Offshore Patrol Vessels" and two "Pollution Control Vessels". The number of small patrol crafts will be increased to 38 within this period.
Bangladesh Coast Guard is also planning to introduce hovercraft into its service for better patrolling capacity through the coast. At least two hovercraft will join the force by 2020.
The coast guard will start its journey as a two dimensional force by inaugurating its aviation wing in this period. 2-4 maritime search and rescue (MSAR) helicopters will be procured for the force within 2020. Surveillance Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)s may be introduced also in this period.
Coast guard will start its journey towards modern surveillance technologies within 2020. The installation of Long-range identification and tracking (LRIT) and "Vessel Traffic Management Information System (VTMIS)" systems will be started within this period.
Medium term (2021 — 2025).
In this period one technical training base and one aviation training base will be set up for the coast guard. The aviation wing of the force will be enriched. Manpower of the force will be increased.
As per the plan, the force will get two more "Pollution Control Vessels" three "Riverine Patrol Vessel", two water jet scooters and 30 high speed patrol crafts in the medium term.
To enrich the aviation capacity, six more helicopters will be procured to make the total number of helicopters ten. Within the same period, six UAVs will be procured also.
As the plan goes, the process of installing Long-range identification and tracking (LRIT) and "Vessel Traffic Management Information System (VTMIS)" systems will be completed by 2025.
Long term (2026 — 2030).
The development of the Bangladesh Coast Guard will continue to thrive in this period. The manpower of the force will be increased further. More ships and UAVs will be added. This period will see the introduction of the maritime patrol aircraft to the coast guard.

Night Frost Crisis

The Night Frost Crisis () or the Night Frost (, ) was a political crisis that occurred in Soviet-Finnish relations in the autumn of 1958. It arose from Soviet dissatisfaction with Finnish domestic policy and in particular with the composition of the third government to be formed under Prime Minister Karl-August Fagerholm. As a result of the crisis, the Soviet Union withdrew its ambassador from Helsinki and put pressure on the Finnish government to resign. The crisis was given its name by Nikita Khrushchev, who declared that relations between the countries had become subject to a "night frost".
Background.
The crisis erupted in August 1958 when the recently-appointed Fagerholm government failed to gain the approval of the Soviet Union. Moscow could not accept that Väinö Leskinen and Olavi Lindblom, who represented the right wing of the country's Social Democratic Party, were in government with the approval of Väinö Tanner, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, himself considered a traitor in the Soviet Union for his activities during the Winter War. The Soviet Union also associated the name of Niilo Kosola, National Coalition Party representative and the Minister for Agriculture, with his father Vihtori Kosola, who had been the leader of the far-right 1930s Lapua Movement (). To make matters worse, the Finnish People's Democratic League () was excluded from the government in spite of their success in the parliamentary elections.
Johannes Virolainen, who had been centrally involved in forming the government and who became the Minister of Foreign Affairs, tried at the last moment to appeal to Väinö Tanner not to accept Väinö Leskinen into the government, to which Tanner replied: "What are you talking about, young man? We are forming the Finnish Government here, not the Soviet one." President Urho Kekkonen had already warned Virolainen about going to the same government with Leskinen. After declaring the government on 29 August, Kekkonen said his famous quote: "This was the worst speech I have ever given, but at least it was not written by me."
In addition to the previous one, the 40th anniversary of the Communist Party of Finland was held at the end of August. However, no visa was issued to Soviet Union delegations originally member Otto Ville Kuusinen, the head of the Winter War period Terijoki Government, which was marked by the Finns as a traitor. The reason for this was pushed into the neck of the Foreign Minister of the Fagerholm III Government, Johannes Virolainen, although the decision was made by the predecessor, the Kuuskoski Government together with President Urho Kekkonen. Nikita Khrushchev had also understood Kuusinen's rejection of his visa, but the official newspaper of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Pravda, nevertheless used the case as a weapon against the Fagerholm government.
Development.
The Soviet pressure on Finland was initially economic in nature: the negotiations over the use of the Saimaa Canal were suspended, the treaty on fishing rights in the Gulf of Finland was postponed, and trade negotiations were held up.
During the autumn, Moscow began exerting pressure at the political level as well. In October, the Soviet ambassador to Finland, Viktor Lebedev, went on "a vacation”, failing to visit the foreign minister, Johannes Virolainen, as protocol required, and it was subsequently announced that he had been transferred to other duties with no plans to appoint a successor. In November, the Agrarian League () forced its ministers to resign from the government and President Urho Kekkonen began manoeuvering to bring down the government. Finally, on December 4, Virolainen announced that he was resigning and shortly after Fagerholm announced the resignation of the entire government. On January 13, 1959, Kekkonen went on state radio and TV to announce the formation of an Agrarian minority government led by V. J. Sukselainen.
The crisis attracted international attention. In a meeting brokered by the then head of the body representing Finnish industries, Johan Nykopp, United States Democratic Senator Hubert Humphrey met President Kekkonen in November 1958 while the American was on his way to Moscow and offered Finland economic support to relieve the Soviet pressure. The Finnish Foreign Ministry found itself in a difficult position and ultimately declined the offer of help, fearing that it would do more harm than good, not least to Finland's international reputation.
Resolution.
The Night Frost Crisis was resolved during a private trip Urho and Sylvi Kekkonen made to Leningrad in January 1959, where he "accidentally" met Nikita Khrushchev and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. During the lunch that followed the negotiations, Khrushchev declared that whilst Finland had the right to decide on its governments, the Soviet Union also had the right to decide what it thinks about them. It was President Kekkonen's considered opinion that the Night Frost Crisis was caused by the internal disputes within the Social Democratic Party. On February 3, 1959, diplomatic relations between the countries were restored when the Soviet Union appointed Alexey Zakharov as the new ambassador to Finland.
Consequences.
As a result of his handling of the international crisis, Urho Kekkonen's position as leader of Finnish domestic policy was strengthened. Over the next twenty years, Kekkonen determined the composition of Finnish governments and neither a party nor an individual could enter the government without his say-so. Historians still dispute Kekkonen's motives for bringing down the Fagerholm government.

The River Strine is a tributary of the River Tern flowing through the Telford and Wrekin district of Shropshire in England. The river drains the Weald Moors a fenland area north of Telford, and also takes runoff from Newport and Lilleshall. Tributaries of the Strine include the Pipe Strine, Red Strine, and Wall Brook.
Course.
The river is formed by the confluence of the Pipe Strine and the Wall Brook. It flows through Cherrington Moor, and past the hamlet of Rodway, and then through Dayhouse and Crudgington Moor, where it is joined by the Commission Drain or Red Strine. Beyond this point it passes the village of Crudgington, where it is bridged by the A442, it then joins the Tern.

Forest cover

Forest cover is the amount of land area that is covered by forest. It may be measured as relative (in percent) or absolute (in square kilometres/square miles).
Definition.
According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), a forest is defined as land spanning more than with trees higher than and a canopy cover of more than 10%, or trees able to reach these thresholds "in situ". It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use. 
Ecological impact.
Global forest cover, however crucial for soil health, the water cycle, climate and air quality it is, is severely threatened by deforestation, as a direct consequence of agriculture, grazing, and mining.
Forest cover can be increased by reforestation and afforestation efforts, but it is virtually impossible to restore the full range of ecological services once natural forests are converted to other land uses.
Extent.
Since the onset of agriculture (about 12,000 years ago), the number of trees worldwide has dropped by 46%, according to one research published in 2018.
Global forest cover now has been estimated to be just 31% or in 2006 with 12-yearly losses (2000-2012) amounting to and reforestation gains about . According to the FAO's "Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020", the world has a total forest area of , which is 31% of the total land area.
More than half (54%) of the world’s forests are found in only five countries (Brazil, Canada, China, Russia and the USA).
The largest part of the forest (45%) is found in the tropical domain, followed by the boreal, temperate and subtropical domains. These domains are further divided into terrestrial global ecological zones, 20 of which contain some forest cover. Almost half the forest area (49%) is relatively intact, while 9% is found in fragments with little or no connectivity. Tropical rainforests and boreal coniferous forests are the least fragmented, whereas subtropical dry forest and temperate oceanic forests are among the most fragmented. Roughly 80% of the world’s forest area is found in patches larger than . The remaining 20% is located in more than 34 million patches across the world – the vast majority less than in size.
The world’s total growing stock of trees decreased slightly, from in 1990 to in 2020, due to a net decrease in forest area. On the other hand, growing stock is increasing per unit area globally and in all regions; it rose from 132 m3 per ha in 1990 to 137 m3 per ha in 2020. Growing stock per unit area is highest in the tropical forests of South and Central America and West and Central Africa.

Hennebergisches Gymnasium &quot;Georg Ernst&quot;

The Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst" (HGS) is a public grammar school with Alumnat (boarding school, privately sponsored) in the Thuringian city of Schleusingen. Founded in June 1577 by the Georg Ernst, Earl of Henneberg, it is one of the oldest continuously operated high schools in Germany.
The Gymnasium sees itself as a humanistic school. Since 2002, however, the focus of the education has been in the mathematical-scientific areas.
History.
In 1446, a school under ecclesiastical responsibility was mentioned for the first time in Schleusingen. Both students and teachers had to perform activities on behalf of the city and the church. Since 1502 there is evidence of a Latin school. In 1508, the royal educator Johann Jäger is named the first schoolmaster. After the Reformation, (presumably in 1556) the school relocated to the building of the Barfüsserklosters in the Klosterstrasse, the same location where it can be found today. The last governing Earl of Henneberg, Georg Ernst, issued a school ordinance in 1560, which turned the city school into a royal regional school. He also set a curriculum beginning of June 1569, after which, in addition to the Liberal Arts also the Christian religion should be taught according to the Augsburg Confession. Two exams were to be held each year. In 1577, he founded the Schleusinger Gymnasium from the public Latin School.
Above the entrance to the cellar, in the archway, is the oldest stone of the main building, on which the inscription "illustre Gymn" and the year number 1715 can be seen. In the 16th century, it was customary to refer to a school that taught a complete humanistic course as "illustre". It could correspond to the teaching of the lower faculty of a university.
Establishment of the Alumnat (boarding school).
Immediately after the founding of the Gymnasium, Georg Ernst also donated a "nursing and educational institution at the Gymnasium", which was opened on October 14, 1577, with 30 students. With this, Georg Ernst took the support of children and adolescents of poorer classes into his own hands. Additionally, there were scholarships that allowed the graduates to visit a university.
A large room in the former monastery served as the communal apartment. To regulate the coexistence, special regulations were introduced. These "Leges speciales", the school's oldest housing rules, remained unchanged throughout the entire first century of the school's existence.
Many graduates of the Gymnasium later studied in Leipzig. Through many studious and diligent students, after only a few decades, the school had acquired such an extraordinary reputation that around 1616 a Leipzig professor coined the phrase: "Haud fumos vendit Schleusinga - Schleusingen does not sell smoke". Due to financial constraints, the housing community had to be closed in 1637 for seven years and at reopening it initially only served as a meal catering institution for students. During the Thirty Years War (1618-1648) most of the establishment had deteriorated and had to be rebuilt.
Andreas Reyher as Rector (1632-1639).
The rectorate of Andreas Reyhers in the middle of the Thirty Years' War fell into a difficult phase of the school's existence. His activities at the Gymnasium Schleusingen were crucial for his educational employment in the following years in Gotha, which made him a well-known personality of Thuringian education and school history.
The war also affected the county of Henneberg: plague, pestilence, famine and the increasing lack of contributions to the Landschulkasse due to the incompetence of the county offices made it difficult not only the parents of students but also the school itself to be able to raise the funding. Nevertheless, Reyher wanted to reform teaching methods and published his own writings on school practice. In particular, his contributions to Greek grammar, arithmetic, and geometry enriched school life. Furthermore, he renewed the school laws and promoted theatrical performances and the integration of pedagogical approaches of Comenius, Ratke and his students Helwig and Evenius. This found in a book printed in Schleusingen on education with the title "Palaeomathia". According to Reyer, a teacher attains dignity and authority through humanity, wisdom, justice, and knowledge, and should be mindful of each student's progress, rich or poor. Andreas Reyher was in regular correspondence with scholars of his time and was also mentioned by name in a letter from Comenius to his university teacher (1633). Early on, it was possible to recognize a devotion to pedagogical realism, which in the following years brought subject focused lessons to the forefront. An example of this is his writing "Kurtzer Unterricht von natürlichen Dingen", which includes subjects related to the teaching of sciences.
After the division of the Ernestinian lands in 1640, Reyher was appointed to be the organizer of the Saxony-Gotha school system by Duke Ernst the Pious and made rector of the Residenzstadt.
Until the End of the 19th Century.
With the administrative reform for the joint administration of the city of Schleusingen by Saxon princes, the school was run as a "Gemeinschaftliches Hennebergisches Gymnasium". Poverty dominated the country and this did also leave marks at the school. However, despite a lack of teaching materials and a low number of students, the grammar school and the Alumnat were able to maintain the reputation of the "illustre gymnasium" through the 18th century.
The most important teacher at the beginning of the 18th century was Christian Juncker. For almost twelve years he worked as a vice principal. Political regimes and divisions of the country favored a poor financial position of the Gymnasium in the years between 1815 and 1840. Only when 1841 Saxony-Meiningen renounced the co-administration and the exemptions in the Alumnat, was the school appointed "Royal Prussian Henneberg Gymnasium and Alumnat". It retained this title until 1918. Throughout the centuries, the lessons were still held in the building of 1502. Over time, its structural condition had deteriorated enormously. September 10, 1870, marks the beginning of the construction of a new school building. In early May 1874, students were finally able to move into this building, called the "box".
German Empire and Weimar Republic.
At the beginning of the 20th century, the political development increasingly determined teaching content and everyday school life. The school year began after the Easter holidays in April. Special highlights in the school year were the Sedanfest, the ceremony for Luther's birthday, the Eccefeier (a celebration to remember former students, teachers, affiliates, who have died in the previous 12 months) and the celebration of the Emperor's birthday. There were also communion celebrations, excursions, swimming festivals, Advent and Christmas celebrations. The Alumni used their free time to explore Schleusingen and the surrounding area. A popular destination were the local glass and porcelain factories. Around 1907 the school was given a new ambiance by Gymnasium director Orth. Greek sculptures now adorned the corridors, rooms were painted colorfully, and the auditorium received gothic elements. The Gymnasium was the cultural center of the city; student theater-, music-, and sports events were open to the public. Professor Franke facilitated a workshop for woodworking and metalworking, where students made benches and signposts for the Thuringian Forest and demonstration equipment for physics and mathematics lessons.
With the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, many students volunteered for military service. As early as the following month, on September 8, 1914, the lessons for the higher grades were suspended, due to a lack of students. In the first year of the war, 24 of its former students fell. It was difficult to maintain school operations with so many of the students and teachers fighting at the front. Due to the increasing impoverishment, fewer and fewer foreign parents were able to bear the costs for Education and Alumnat, resulting in the number of students falling drastically. While there had been 171 students in 1913, in 1916 there were only 96 left.
After the First World War, the new, social-democratic state government of Thuringia reformed the school system again, but a large part of the teachers resisted this modernization. Pentecost 1923, the first female student was admitted.
Third Reich and Post-War Period.
In a structural extension in 1928, the Direktorenhaus (Principal's building) was added to the southwest wing of the main building. As a result, the space in the Alumnat could be increased considerably. At the beginning of the thirties, the political movement of the "Third Reich" entered the city; with the assumption of office of Hitler in the year 1933, it also entered into the school life. The school was to be aligned with the political directives of the time. It became compulsory to attend rallies. Racial education was introduced as a mandatory subject, the successful completion of which was a prerequisite for graduation.
Towards the end of the war, the school operations were discontinued but could be resumed by October 1945. After setting up a girls' boarding school in 1946 in the Georg-Neumark-street, the school was renamed "Max-Greil-Oberschule" in 1947. The school now only taught four grades (9 through 12), while the lower grades from then on were taught at the local middle school.
After the German Reunification, the lessons at the school again commenced in grade 5.
Time in the GDR.
Since 1946, girls had their own accommodation in today's Alumnatsgebäude, the boys were, as had been customary, on the second floor of the main school building. From 1948 only students from the ninth grade onwards attended the Gymnasium, so there was no more need for a house mistress. The coexistence in the boarding school was instead regulated by a boarding school initiative and various commissions for cultural design. In the fifties, students from different parts of the GDR came to Schleusingen. Including some celebrities of the time: Three daughters of Hermann Henselmann (chief architect Berlin Stalin Hall), the daughter of Theodor Brugsch (personal physician Ulbricht) and a niece of Horst Sindermann.
In 1952, the school celebrated its 375th anniversary. Students and teachers prepared many cultural highlights for the anniversary celebration. In addition to sports competitions and theater performances, a stargazing hike to the Stutenhaus was undertaken. The death of Stalin in 1953 had far-reaching consequences: There were no oral Abitur examinations in the field of social studies that school year, which had been made a compulsory subject only in 1952. The SED dictatorship promoted the link between school and economic production. The school (then high school) was assigned to sponsoring organizations. Depending on the assignments of their school, students had to participate in harvesting activities and were sometimes used as production aids.
In July 1958, due to space constraints, the majority of the School Library was moved to the Museum of the Bertholdsburg. Unlike with similar libraries, where stock often was burned or sold, for centuries, the approximately 15,000 volumes of the Gymnasium's School Library had been guarded and protected.
With the construction of the wall in 1961, the school was robbed of one of its teachers. On August 13, 1961, Mathematics teacher Wolfgang Pache had visited West Berlin and was "walled out". He was unable to return to the GDR and did not work as a teacher again. Clothes and literature from the West were prohibited. From 1948 onwards, all directors and about 2/3 of teachers were members of the SED. At that time this was an exception because the GDR leadership targeted a 100% membership of the teachers in the SED.
In the school year 1962/63, the "Abitur with vocational training" was introduced in Schleusingen. From motor vehicle technology to electrical engineering, toolmaking or training as a furniture specialist or industrial and commercial merchant, even vocational training in agriculture and medical nursing professions were offered. Throughout the training, students received a monthly pay between 40 and 70 marks. During holidays, internships were completed in the companies. This form of training existed until 1970. Later followed a new form of polytechnic training, the "scientific-practical work". The work itself, as well as the theses to be defended, were part of the graduation requirements (similar to today's seminar work at the Hennebergische Gymnasium). Furthermore, there was a change in the Directorate of the school. The former headmaster was reassigned to the position of boarding school director and Peter Nestler (former student, later teacher) became the youngest director of a secondary school in the Suhl district at the age of 30.
His comprehensive education reform in cooperation with the Pädagogischen Hochschule Erfurt and with some teachers modernized the school's operation. The basic building blocks of this reform were group lessons, a better student-teacher ratio, and student self-responsibility. Parts of those reforms are still anchored in the school's mission statement today.
An official order in 1983 instructed for partitions to be built in larger rooms in the old main school building in order to make room for student boarders. As early as the summer of '89, the director Katharina Pfeufer, who was put into office in 1988, allowed her students to revive the graduation baptism tradition prohibited in 1974 by the GDR regime.
Nineties until Today.
In 1991, the Gymnasium was renamed to carry the name of its founder: Hennebergisches Gymnasium "Georg Ernst". In the same year, director Hubert Amthor was appointed headmaster. With the continuation of the Latin lessons in the school year 1993/94, a 100-year-old tradition could be continued. Unfortunately, another long tradition ended with the closure of the Alumnat in 1994. The establishment of new grammar schools contributed to the fact that the Gymnasium today has a primarily regional importance.
In 1999, with the demolition of the director's house began the extensive construction and renovation measures that were to contribute to the preservation of Schleusinger school. In order to ensure continuity for the 870 students during the construction period, they were accommodated in the former Alumnat building in Georg-Neumark-Straße, in the main building, in the local elementary school, and in specially provided containers. With the completion of the new building in 2001, a contemporary framework for the Schleusinger Gymnasium has been created. Additionally, the school received the additional title "Environmental- and European School". This is thanks to the collaboration of students and teachers with many other European schools as part of the Comenius project. School traditions developed over the years, such as Stöpselball, Stifterball, Elferrat conference, Christmas Party, Winter Ball, Carnival and the graduation baptism as identity-creating elements, have since taken place every school year. With the beginning of the school year 2012/13, the use of the Alumnat is also possible again: The city of Schleusingen, the Stiftung and the Hildburghausen Educational Center (HBZ) have jointly contributed to the reconstruction. This also gives students outside the region the opportunity to attend the HGS.
Structures of the Grammar School with Alumnat and their Interaction.
The school is a public grammar school, under the district of Hildburghausen. The State Education Office South Thuringia supports in the fulfillment of educational tasks and has the supervision of principals, assistant principals, teachers and other responsible persons. The teachers and other employees are employees of the Thuringian Ministry of Culture.
Both the Förderverein (Verein der Freunde und Förderer des Hennebergischen Gymnasiums „Georg Ernst“ Schleusingen e. V.) and the Stiftung (Stiftung des Hennebergischen Gymnasiums „Georg Ernst“ in Schleusingen) are organized under private law. They support the school in terms of their own statutes and are independent of other bodies, such as the municipality, district or Ministry of Culture. Together, they promote and shape life and learning in the school and the Alumnat.
The Förderverein of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst".
Former students and teachers took the initiative in 1991 and revived the Förderverein so that it can support the interests of the school charitably; this is the statutory purpose of the association. In essence, the work is funded by membership fees and donations. All members of the association are also volunteers. The club has 349 members (as of November 2012).
The history of the Förderverein.
Even before the founding of the grammar school in 1521, study grants were provided to students studying at the University of Wittenberg, as well as to underprivileged students, who were housed in the community. On September 29, 1927, on the occasion of the 350th anniversary, on the initiative of Rector Witte thirteen gentlemen met to found the first Association of Friends, to which not only teachers but also local business people belonged. In 1940, the board had to suspend its work due to politically prevailing National Socialist structures. The initiative for the revival of the Förderverein came after 1989 from school director Peter Nestler and some teachers and friends (founded in 1992). In it, graduates, parents, teachers, and school-affiliates promote educational work at the Hennebergische Gymnasium through material and moral commitment.
The purpose of the Förderverein.
The following points are stipulated in the statute of the Förderverein:
The Stiftung of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst".
Since August 2, 2006, the Stiftung of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst" is a legal foundation under civil law. Its main objectives are to support and promote the high school, including by providing additional training opportunities and accommodation in the Alumnat. As founder of the Association of Friends and Supporters of the Henneberg Gymnasium "Georg Ernst" e. V. on. The tasks of the Stiftung include to develop, finance and implement long-term projects.
Difference between Stiftung and Förderverein.
While the Förderverein is rather flexible and able to directly promote and support individual students and projects, the activities of the Stiftung are designed for comprehensive and long-term measures. Both pursue the common interest of preserving the traditions of the school and fulfilling the requirements of modern education. Social responsibility, promotion of high performers and contact with former students and teachers are equally important. The Board of Trustees consists of representatives from all relevant corporate bodies and groups of people relevant for education. Together, they advise and supervise the Board and its decisions on objectives and amendments to the Articles of Association. The Förderverein, the city of Schleusingen, the Wohnungsgesellschaft mbH Schleusingen and the Sparkasse Hildburghausen each have a permanent seat on the Board of Trustees.
From the Statute.
The following points summarize the main focus of the Stiftung:
Volunteers and partners of the Stiftung, such as the Verein Medienzentrum Henneberger Land e. V.., and the Hildburghäuser Bildungszentrum e.V. or the Technical University of Ilmenau. It is thanks to the financial support of the patrons that the Stiftung is in a position to support the Schleusinger Gymnasium. Three institutions have taken on special responsibility for the school and its foundation: The Förderverein and the foundation of the Stiftung, the Verein Medienzentrum Henneberger Land e. V. with their financial and personal commitment, and the city of Schleusingen in the form of the endowment of the Alumnat building and the financial support for the renovation of the same.
Alumnat of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst".
Records of the Alumnat go back to the founding year of the Gymnasium. At that time, the institution was predominantly benefitting gifted children of impoverished parents, offering them a chance to attend school. A large number of students experienced and therefore learned here until 1994 what it means to live and work together. In 2012, the Alumnat was reopened through the city of Schleusingen, the Stiftung, and the Hildburghäuser Bildungszentrum e. V.
The sponsor of the Alumnat is the Stiftung of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst" in Schleusingen. It provides land and buildings and coordinates the cooperation between the school and the operator. The operator is the Hildburghäuser Bildungszentrum e. V. It has been agreed between the Stiftung and the operator that initially also non-students can be granted accommodation in the Alumnat, provided the capacities are sufficient.
Particularities of the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst".
As throughout its history, the HGS is heavily leaning on the traditional values and principles of the founder in 1577. With the support of students, teachers, partners, sponsors and supporters, these values and principles can be put into practice. In addition to the traditional values, principles, and traditions, the cultural orientation area has a special significance. At an early stage, historically important literary works were taught and theatrical performances rehearsed (see History). Not only the considerable collection of old books and documents (School Library) but also the current interest and focus on new forms of media (Video-AG) are based on the beginnings of the history of printing. The comprehensive all-day offer and the Alumnat, as well as the extra-curricular offers, promote the community among the students and between students and teachers. International projects and cooperations with partner schools, companies and universities enable a versatile education and, early on, place emphasis on independent acting and thinking. The practical education and the many years of experience complete the education students receive during their school years at the Hennebergische Gymnasium "Georg Ernst".
Values and Training.
The school's mission statement lists the main values and principles of the school. Encourage, shape, live and learn: both students with special talents and students with learning difficulties are encouraged. Supported by the Förderverein and the Stiftung, teachers, and students have different ways to improve and enhance performance. Students with learning and performance weaknesses will be helped in the setting of the classroom. Representing this is an inscription in the main entrance area of the main building "Salus populi suprema lex" (Eng. "The good of the people is the supreme commandment").
The nurturing of a humanistic training provides the basis for comprehensive education in all subjects. As a STEM-friendly school, the HGS places great value on result-oriented education in all natural science subjects. Additional offers enable students to gain in-depth skills. International cooperation with partner schools, a good student-teacher-relationship, as well as foresight, responsibility, and participation of students, teachers and local residents in school life shape the humane image of the school, the respectful interaction in the foreground. The school is proactive in its strive for inclusion. It bears the titles "European School" and "School without Racism - School with Courage".
The proximity to the Biosphere Reserve Vessertal and the Nature Reserve Thuringian Forest, environmental education is of great importance. One student project deals with waste separation, another with the conscious use of natural resources in life. Further, in the context of a thesis, nesting places were established for the kestrels and jackdaws who inhabit the tower of the school. The entire campus is a smoking free zone and there is a green classroom for outdoor lessons. Since 1995 the school holds the title "Environmental School".
Abiturtaufe (Graduation Babtism).
Many history-steeped schools have traditions such as school balls, parties or special celebrations for the day of graduation. In Schleusingen, however, there is an in Germany unique and unrivaled tradition: the Abiturtaufe (Graduation Batism).
The tradition started long ago. After the successful completion of all exams, the graduates were carried, on the shoulders of three younger students, from the main entrance of the school, over the marketplace to the post office. This triad was supposed to symbolize a Roman chariot. From the post office, the high school graduates telegraphed their parents home, informed them of the successful completion of their studies and asked for a monetary bonus for a big celebration. When the graduating class also included women, the tradition was altered, initially only for them. Instead of being carried on the shoulders of their peers, they pulled to the post office in handcarts. However, after the Second World War, female as well as male graduates, were traveling in handcarts.
The year 1947 then marked the beginning of the tradition how it is still practiced today (it was not practiced in the GDR from 1974 to 1989. The handcart is decorated by ninth-graders with twigs, flowers, balloons and also references to the graduate riding in the cart. Two Tenth-grade students pull the cart around the school, through the city to the market square. The procession is led by the city band. At the fountain in the center of the market a short, peer composed rime is read for each of the graduates. Students of the eleventh grade, dressed up as "Klostertäufer" (monastery baptists), poor water from the Elisabethenbrunnen over handcart passengers. Occasionally, graduates will be completely submerged in a substitute fountain (an old, ornate, colorfully painted bathtub) that is filled with water from the market fountain already. In the past, the graduates were thrown straight into the fountain; however, today, in order to protect the historic fountain and the statue of Countess Elisabeth, that is not permitted anymore. To protect Saint Elisabeth from having to observe this unseemly custom, she is blindfolded ahead of the event.
Historical Collections of Literature in the School Library.
In the Henneberg area, the driving force for printing was in Schleusingen. As early as 1555 printing begun here following the initiative of Earl Georg Ernst. Some of the books printed are still in the School Library today. One of the most important clients for printed work was the Gymnasium.
The Schleusinger School Library was passed down almost completely and is one of the oldest of its kind. Through the comprehensive history of the school it was possible to collect many precious books over the years. In the beginning, this is mostly attributed to Earl Georg Ernst. In the following years, to rectors and teachers of the school, who donated their books to the library. The majority of the collection is stored in the Bertholdsburg. The well-preserved and precious books thematize the history of Henneberg and the regional history of Thuringia. The oldest book is a manuscript from 1424. In addition, 24 handwritten manuscripts and an original letter in Latin authored by Martin Luther from 1536 belong to the collection. In total, the library comprises 17,747 volumes and 199 incunabula. Since 1958, the historic collection is located in the Naturhistorischen Museum at Schloss Bertholdsburg.
The school itself has a book collection of current literature and a reading room that is open to students. Additionally, cultural events, such as author readings, organized by the school and the city can be held in the school library. Older students use the library as a reading room during times without classes. The borrowing of books is possible for all students and teachers.
The collection of the School Library in Schleusingen, has been a valuable resource for numerous research personalities, whose work profited significantly from what has been amassed.
Culture and Media Orientation.
School Museum
In the attic of the new building is a school museum maintained by students. It shows the history of the school from its beginnings until today. Collages were created for this purpose. The design and presentation of pictures, contemporary documents and old works of art were also implemented by students. After a renovation, the school museum reopened in 2013 and can be visited during the annual open house. In the future, the museum will be expanded with a digital photo gallery to meet the demands of modern media.
School Club
The school club has a long tradition at the Hennebergische Gymnasium. It is located in the vaulted cellar of the school. Musical and cultural events were organized here until 2012. Performers also included non-student bands. Additionally, other miscellaneous events were organized. At least once a month there was a club night, where several bands from the region performed. In November 2013, the activities of the school club were resumed under the name "Clubkeller" with the support of a small student group and the school social worker. The club itself does not belong to the organization of the school but is supported by the Stiftung. It is an independent entity and is therefore independent of the administration of the school district Hildburghausen.
Dances and Events
Various school balls, such as the Stöpselball or the Stifterball, are organized annually by students with the support of teachers. These events are not only accessible to students but also to external guests. Teachers supervise the events and ensure a smooth process.

V. students create videos and movies, edit and add a soundtrack.
Alumnat and Full-Time Offer.
Although there were interim, temporary shutdowns lasting a few years, the Alumnat (boarding school) operations can be traced back to a total of 435 years of tradition.

Shobdon Court

Shobdon Court was an 18th-century English country house in the village of Shobdon, near Leominster, Herefordshire. Although the main house has since been demolished, the service wing and the stable block have been converted to residential use. 
Shobdon Court was rectangular in plan and sat in parkland on the side of a hill. Built in brick it was similar in appearance to Clarendon House in London. It was substantially remodelled in the mid 1800s.
History.
The Shobdon estate was bought in 1705 by Sir James Bateman, Lord Mayor of London and Governor of the Bank of England, who replaced the Jacobean house with a new Palladian style building. On his death in 1718 it passed to his son William Bateman, 1st Viscount Bateman and was inherited in turn by the latter's son, John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman, who put it in the care of his brother Richard. When John died in 1802 the Viscountcy became extinct and Shobdon Court passed to a relative, William Hanbury, who was ennobled as Baron Bateman in 1837 after having changed his name to Bateman-Hanbury. 
The estate was passed down through the Bateman-Hanbury family until the 3rd Lord Bateman died in 1931. On his death the Bateman Barony also became extinct and estate was sold. The Shobdon Court house was demolished in 1933 but the service and stable blocks converted to apartments. Both the service block and the stable block are now Grade II listed buildings.
World War II.
During the Second World War the remaining court buildings we requisitioned and formed the officers quarters for the then RAF Shobdon. One of the legacies of this was the construction of an on site squash court which still exists today.
Church and arches.
The estate's church, St John's, was completely rebuilt between 1749-1752 for John Bateman, 2nd Viscount Bateman, in a Rococo style. Simon Jenkins, in his book "England's Thousand Best Churches", considers the interior "a complete masterpiece (of) English Rococo." It is a Grade I listed building.
Arches from the interior of the church were removed in the 18th century to form an eye-catcher in the grounds of the Court.

Jonathan Anderson (fashion designer)

Jonathan Anderson is a fashion designer and the founder of JW Anderson. Anderson has had success with a number of collections in recent years with his eponymous label and has also served as the creative director of Spanish luxury house, LOEWE.
Early life.
Anderson was born in the town of Magherafelt in Northern Ireland in 1984. He is the son of Willie Anderson, who played international rugby for Ireland between 1984 and 1990. His mother is Heather Buckley, who worked as a secondary school teacher.
Anderson grew up in Northern Ireland, but spent a lot of time on the Balearic island of Ibiza, where his parents owned a house. He has since stated in interviews that the contrasting environments played a big role in shaping his sensibilities as a designer.
At the age of 18 he moved to the United States in an attempt to become an actor. He was based in New York at The Juilliard School, but developed an interest in costume design rather than acting. He moved to Dublin shortly after, securing his first fashion-based job at the Dublin department store, Brown Thomas.
Jonathan later moved to London, graduating from the London College of Fashion in 2005.
Career.
Anderson began his career working as a visual merchandiser for Prada, working for Manuela Pavesi. He launched his own menswear collection shortly after in 2008. His first collection under the JW Anderson label received critical acclaim. In 2010, Anderson received sponsorship from the British Fashion Council's Newton committee and subsequently produced his first catwalk collection at London Fashion Week.
The rising success of Anderson's JW Anderson label allowed him to secure a second NewGen sponsorship and led to a collaboration with high-street retailer, Topshop in 2012. The collaboration was a collection of limited-edition items, known as the JW Anderson x Topshop collection. It featured clothing and accessories ranging from mini-kilts and paisley prints, to Halloween motifs and included a range of stationery, iPhone cases and Rubik cubes. The collection sold out within hours of it launching. Anderson and Topshop scheduled another collaboration to launch a year later, with the release coming in February 2013.
Later that year, Donatella Versace enlisted him to replace Christopher Kane at Versace’s diffusive line Versus, where he showcased his first collection in June at New York’s Lexington Armoury.

Lympne Escarpment

Lympne Escarpment is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest west of Hythe in Kent.Part of it is the remains of a Saxon Shore fort now called Stutfall Castle, which is a Scheduled Monument.
This steeply sloping site has woodland and grassland on Kentish ragstone, with many springs and flushes at the base. It is close to the sea, and the resulting high humidity allows plants such as stinking iris, which are usually confined to woods, to grow in grassland.
Public footpaths cross the site.

Victory Lap (Nipsey Hussle album)

Victory Lap is the debut studio album by American rapper Nipsey Hussle. It’s the only studio album to be released during his lifetime. It was released on February 16, 2018 through All Money In No Money Out and Atlantic Records. It was Nipsey Hussle's first major commercial release after releasing a string of mixtapes for thirteen years as well as the only full-length album released during his lifetime. The album debuted at number four on the "Billboard" 200, selling 53,000 album-equivalent units; it reached a new peak of number two in April 2019, following Hussle's death. It received a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 61st Grammy Awards.
Critical reception.
"Victory Lap" received widespread critical acclaim upon release. Ian McQuaid of "The Guardian" commented that Nipsey Hussle "effortlessly claims his place as crown prince of G-funk’s new school", adding that "his brags rasp as hoarse and righteous as a man in the middle of a three-day bender, riding beats built from oozing bass swagger and slinking Compton synths, as brash and gleeful as peak-era NWA. It’s visceral west coast rap at its unapologetic finest, as Hussle refreshes cliches of unstoppable prowess with the conviction of a true believer." However he also judged that "At least half the album feels like padding."
Sheldon Pearce of "Pitchfork" labelled "Victory Lap" as "the most gripping record in his catalog", also adding: "The hour-long album honors all the work he’s put in and looks back at all he’s achieved, but it also looks forward to all he has yet to build and all those he can still inspire. His tactics can be tone-deaf and without nuance, but he knows exactly who he’s speaking to and for."
Trent Clark of "HipHopDX" concluded: "Minor potholes aside, "Victory Lap" not only boosts Nipsey’s stock but it raises expectations for the next time he eyes a checkered flag. The benchmark for quality has been set and the race to officially hit the championship podium is only getting revved up." Online publication "HotNewHipHop" stated that "Victory Lap" "toes the line between classic and contemporary hip-hop. It captures the emotion of now, this victorious moment for Hussle, while still pushing for the permanence of a hip-hop classic. It's hard to tell whether "Victory Lap" offers a transient infectious feeling or life-long addiction, but this album should age well. The production is masterful, the features are well-placed, and Nipsey raps like he just won a marathon. The race for the victory paid off."
Commercial performance.
"Victory Lap" debuted at number four on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, earning 53,000 album-equivalent units, with 30,000 in traditional album sales in its first week of release. This is Hussle's first top 10 album on the chart. The album also debuted at number three on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Following Hussle's death on March 31, 2019, the album reached a new peak of number two on the US "Billboard" 200, earning 66,000 album-equivalent units (with 17,000 in traditional album sales) in April 2019, behind Billie Eilish's "When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?". Three album tracks, "Double Up", "Last Time That I Checc'd" and "Dedication" also debuted on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 for the week dated April 13, 2019. On January 8, 2020, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over a million units in the United States.

Renato Rocha (bassist)

Renato da Silva Rocha (May 27, 1961 – February 22, 2015), affectionately known as Billy or Negrete by his close friends, was a Brazilian musician and songwriter famous for being the bassist of influential rock band Legião Urbana from 1984 until 1989. He helped to compose some of the band's most memorable songs, such as "Angra dos Reis", "Acrilic on Canvas", "Quase sem Querer" and "Daniel na Cova dos Leões".
Biography.
Early life.
Renato da Silva Rocha was born in Rio de Janeiro, in the "bairro" of São Cristóvão, on May 27, 1961, but his family had to move to Brasília in 1970, when he was nine years old, after his father, a military, was transferred there. Rocha initially lived at the W3 avenue, from 1970 to 1974. Afterwards he moved to the 306 super square, where he got acquainted with the band Tela, one of many bands that formed in Brasília during the 1970s. Despite their friendship, Rocha was never an official member of Tela.
Known for his athletic physique, Rocha got his famous nickname "Negrete" after joining the volleyball team; it was initially written as "Negrelle", referencing the famous volleyball player José Osvaldo da Fonseca Marcelino (a.k.a. Negrelli), who began his career playing for the club and partook of the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. It later became "Negrete" as an inside joke of his friends, saying it was too "French-sounding".
Rocha later moved to 16 super square, where he befriended Geruza, a former member of punk bands Escola de Escândalos and Blitz 64. Through Geruza he would get acquainted with André Pretorius, Fê Lemos and Renato Russo, of Aborto Elétrico, and Marcelo Bonfá.
Career.
Rocha's first band was Gestapo, which alongside him was also composed of Lulu Gouveia, Joãozinho Viradinha (who later became a gospel singer) and Judas. Concomitantly he was also a member of Smegma and Hosbond Kama. In 1981 he formed Dents Kents, alongside Fred (vocals), future Plebe Rude member Jander Bilaphra (drums) and Feijão (electric guitar). The band broke up the following year.
In late 1984 he was invited to join Legião Urbana as bassist, after Renato Russo was unable to record his bass parts for their then-upcoming self-titled debut album after a suicide attempt in which he tried to slash his wrists. Rocha then became a full member of the band, and was also featured on the band's two subsequent albums, "Dois" and "Que País É Este".
Rocha left Legião Urbana in 1989, prior to the recording sessions of "As Quatro Estações". In an interview given years later, he claimed that he was abruptly fired by Renato Russo, who told him, after leaving an elevator: "You're out of my band". Dado Villa-Lobos would later elaborate that the real reason of Rocha's ousting was his alcoholism, and other behavioral problems. He temporarily returned to Legião in 1997, to help finish work on the album "Uma Outra Estação", which was suddenly left unfinished due to Renato Russo's death the year before; he was credited as a guest musician on the album's opening track, "Riding Song".
After his tenure with Legião Urbana Rocha briefly played for bands Cartilage and Solana Star. Cartilage reportedly managed to release two extended plays prior to their demise. By the late 1990s/early to mid-2000s Rocha had disappeared from the public eye.
Financial problems and death.
On March 25, 2012, RecordTV's electronic journal "Domingo Espetacular" reported that Rocha was living in squalor in the streets of Rio de Janeiro. He claimed to have had troubles with alcoholism and drug abuse, and that his royalties from Legião Urbana were not enough for him to make a living. During his final years of life he was interned at a rehabilitation clinic in Cotia, São Paulo, thanks to the efforts of Renato Russo's son Giuliano Manfredini.
On February 22, 2015, Rocha died following a sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 53. He was staying with a female friend at an hotel room in Guarujá since February 19. He was buried two days later at the Cemitério Memorial Parque Paulista in Embu das Artes.

Panagia Gremniotissa

Panagia Gremniotissa () or Panagia Gremiotissa () is a Greek Orthodox church in Ios, Greece.
Legend.
According to the legend, during the Ottoman occupation of Greece, some people in Crete afraid of the Ottomans wanting to protect their religion and its symbols put a religious image of Panagia in a wooden raft with a candle on it with hopes that someone will find it and rescue the image. Later on, some Herder during a night noticed a light in Milopota's beach and found the raft and the image. Then, they took it and gave it to the church of Saint Nikolas. The next morning, according to the legend, the image mysteriously moved to the church of Saint Eleftherios in Palaiokastro. After the phenomenon was repeated three times, convinced by her miracles, the locals decided to built a church for the image, but every time they started building they found the bricks next to the Church of Saint Eleftherios. After that, the people of Ios decided to built the church in a place where Crete is visible, and people of all ages from all over the island got together and started building the church.
Name.
The church, due to its high altitude as being almost on the top of Chora's cliff has the name Gremniotissa with means 'of the cliff', and Panagia is the patron saint. All together literally means Virgin Mary of the Cliff.

Byzantine Empire under the Leonid dynasty

The Eastern Roman Empire was ruled by the House of Leo from AD 457, the accession of Leo I, to 518, the death of Anastasius I. The rule of the Leonid dynasty coincided with the rapid decline, collapse and eventual fall of the Western Roman Empire. Following the end of the Western Empire, Emperor Zeno abolished the position of Western Roman Emperor and declared himself the sole Roman Emperor. The Eastern Roman Empire would come to last for several more centuries, and subsequent dynasties would invest large amounts of resources in attempts to retake the western provinces.
The Leonid dynasty also ruled the Western Roman Empire from 474 to its abolishment in AD 480.
Leo I and Leo II, 457-474.
After the death of Marcian and the end of the Theodosian dynasty, Leo I was placed upon the throne by the Alan general Aspar, who served as commander-in-chief of the Eastern Roman army and enjoyed a role similar to that of Ricimer in the Western Roman Empire, appointing puppet emperors. Aspar had believed that Leo I would be a weak puppet, but Leo grew increasingly independent of him and after Aspar and his son Ardabur were murdered in a riot in 471, the Eastern Empire was restored to fully Roman leadership, which it would retain for centuries to come.
By the time of Leo's accession, the Western Roman Empire had nearly collapsed entirely. Though it enjoyed a brief restoration of power under Emperor Majorian, the West had become restricted to northern Gaul, Italy and parts of Illyria by the late 460s. Leo attempted to reconquer North Africa from the Vandals. The campaign was unsuccessful and Northern Africa would remain outside of imperial control until the reign of Justinian I in the early 500s.
Leo I was the earliest emperor to be crowned by the Patriarch of Constantinople and not by a military leader, representing the ecclesiastical hierarchy. This change would eventually become permanent and the religious nature of the coronation had completely replaced the military version in the Middle Ages.
As condition for an alliance with the Isaurians, Leo married his daughter Ariadne to Tarasicodissa, who took the name Zeno, in 466. The son of Ariadne and Zeno, Leo II, succeeded upon the death of Leo I in 474 but he died after only 11 months of rule and was succeeded by Zeno.
Zeno and Basiliscus, 474-491.
The reign of Zeno saw the end of the Western Roman Empire. The dating of the end is somewhat controversial. It is sometimes dated to 476, early in Zeno's reign, when the Germanic Roman general Odoacer deposed the titular Western Emperor Romulus Augustulus, but declined to replace him with another puppet. Odoacer accepted Julius Nepos, the previously deposed Western Emperor supported by Zeno, as his sovereign and acted as his viceroy of Italy. Nepos did not return to Italy but continued to reign as Western Emperor from Dalmatia until his death in 480.
After the death of Julius Nepos, Zeno became the sovereign of Odoacer and he did not appoint another Western Emperor, instead proclaiming himself as the sole Emperor of the Roman Empire, juridically reuniting West and East for the first time in 85 years. The position would never again be divided.
With Odoacer acting increasingly independent, Zeno negotiated with the Ostrogoths of Theoderic, who had settled in Moesia. He sent the gothic king to Italy as "magister militum per Italiam" ("commander in chief for Italy"). After the fall of Odoacer in 493, Theoderic, who had lived in Constantinople during his youth, ruled Italy on his own. Thus, by suggesting that Theoderic conquer Italy as his Ostrogothic Kingdom, Zeno maintained at least a nominal supremacy in the West land while ridding the Eastern Empire of an unruly subordinate.
Zeno was briefly deposed by Basilicus in 475 for twenty months, but regained his throne and imprisoned Basilicus and his family in a dry cistern, where they would die from exposure.
Anastasius I, 491-518.
Anastasius I, an aged civil officer of Roman origin, became Roman Emperor through marriage with the widow of Zeno, Ariadne, in 491. Anastasius was a competent reformer and administrator, perfecting the coinage system introduced by Constantine I by setting the weight of the copper "follis", the most commonly used coin throughout the Empire. Anastasius also abolished the chrysargyron tax, a tax that was hated due to it being collected in lump sums every four years. The monetary reforms of Anastasius lead to the State Treasury containing an enormous 145,150 kg (320,000 lbs) of gold upon his death.
Anastasius would be succeeded by Justin I, the first Emperor of the Justinian dynasty.

The Chute au Tonnerre (Thunder Falls) is upstream from the mouth.
The mouth of the river is located in the municipality of Rivière-au-Tonnerre in the Minganie Regional County Municipality.
The widening at the mouth, which is halfway between Sept-Îles and Havre-Saint-Pierre, forms a natural harbor for small craft that is accessed from the sea through a narrow channel.
The community of Rivière-au-Tonnerre is on both sides of the river mouth, which is crossed by Quebec Route 138.
The southern portion of the "Tonnerre River" hydrographic slope is served by Route 138 along the north shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. The R0902 forest road (going north-west) serves the western part of this slope.
The surface of the "Thunder River" is usually frozen from early November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from late November to mid-April.

In his 1776 map Captain Carver writes the name as "Ouchigoush-ipi". 
The spelling "Uhukuhîpu" has also been used by anthropologists.
The name "Thunder R." appears on the 1853 map by Bouchette fils, and as "R. au Tonnere" on the maps by Taché (1870 and 1880).
Basin.
The river basin covers .
It lies between the basins of the Sheldrake to the west and the Jupitagon to the east.
Part of the basin is in the unorganized territory of Lac-Jérôme and part in the municipality of Rivière-au-Tonnerre.
A map of the ecological regions of Quebec shows the river basin is in sub-regions 6j-S, 6j-T and 6m-T of the east spruce/moss subdomain.

Battle of Jutphaas

The Battle of Jutphaas, also known as the Battle of the Vaart or the Battle of Vreeswijk, occurred on 9 May 1787 on the banks of the Vaartsche Rijn canal near Jutphaas and Vreeswijk between Orangists and Patriots.
Background.
The battle was part of an ever-escalating conflict, dubbed a "civil war" by some, in the Dutch Republic. Orangists, who supported stadtholder William V, Prince of Orange and his aristocratic stadtholderian regime, stood against democratic Patriots, who favoured a new democratic republic and the abolition of nobility and the Orange stadtholderate. Aristocratic Patriots or "Old Patriots", who previously cooperated with the democratic Patriots, increasingly changed their alliances in favour of Orange as the group of democrats grew in size and radicalised. The Patriots, who started arming themselves and formed exercitiegenootschappen across the Republic from 1783 onwards, demanded reforms to how the country was governed. Beginning in 1782, they seized power in more and more cities, where they elected vroedschappen by popular vote instead of traditional cooptation or appointment by the stadtholder.
The city of Utrecht was taken over by the Patriot city guard led by Quint Ondaatje and Jacobus Bellamy on 2 August 1785. The stadtholder and the Orangist regenten declared Utrecht to be a city in rebellion, and relocated the seat of the States of Utrecht to Amersfoort, while stadtholderian troops set up camp near Zeist. William V had to flee from The Hague to Nijmegen in September 1785, when Patriots seized power and deprived him of the command of the Hague garrison. In September 1786, however, stadtholderian forces acted swiftly to retake the small Guelderian cities Hattem and Elburg, occupied by Patriots under Herman Willem Daendels, requiring minimal armed violence. Although these clashes were militarily insignificant, their political impact was great: they sharpened the existing divisions and led to a further militarisation of the conflict.
Battle.
Meanwhile, international diplomacy with France (pro-Patriot), Prussia and Britain (pro-Orange) yielded no results. Orangist troops then moved to occupy several places including Soestdijk, and later Vreeswijk under the count of Efferen. That last move went too far for the Utrecht Patriots, because the sluice at Vreeswijk enabled them to protect the city's south flank by inundations. They decided to send an army commanded by Jean Antoine d'Averhoult, member of the Utrecht vroedschap. The pro-Patriot States of Holland then ordered troops to camp in the border region with Utrecht, under general Albert van Rijssel's command at Woerden.
For contemporaries it wasn't clear where exactly the battle had taken place. Contemporaneous sources both mention "Iutphaas onder d' Vaart" and "het dorp de Vaart", the latter referring to Vreeswijk. Nowadays it has been established the fighting happened on the location of the modern residential area of Fokkesteeg between Jutphaas and Vreeswijk (in 1971 merged to Nieuwegein) and commenced around 10:30 pm. The armies coincidentally ran into each other. Initially, the Patriots intended to negotiate, but the Orangists were startled by the sudden appearance of the enemy, and immediately opened fire. Relatively few casualties were sustained, including the Patriot leaders Cornelis Govert Visscher and Johan van der Vlerk. The Patriots managed to gain the upper hand and emerged victorious. The Orangist soldiers fled, leaving some spoils of war on the battlefield. Both sides retreated.
Impact.
Although of minor military importance, the Patriot press exploited the victory in all sorts of propagandist pamphlets and songs. The Patriots portrayed themselves as heroic, and compared the clash with the Battle of Thermopylae (480 BCE). A folk hero cult evolved around especially Cornelis Visscher, who was given a solemn state funeral.
No matter how small his defeat, it confirmed that the prince was no longer able to control the country's internal affairs through force. Moreover, a few days later Amsterdam came firmly into Patriot hands when the Orangist Bijltjesoproer was put down on 30 May. His wife Wilhelmina of Prussia's arrest at Goejanverwellesluis (28 June) underlined this powerlessness, and prompted Orange to once more petition Prussia to intervene. King Frederick William II of Prussia mounted diplomatic pressure, but the Patriots were not prepared to make any concessions. In the meantime, the States of Holland formed Defence Commission with the Utrecht Patriots on 19 July on the recommendation of the Amsterdam Patriots. The Prussian invasion of Holland eventually occurred in September 1787, with 25,000 troops easily crushing the Patriot rebels, who did not receive any help from their allies France or the United States, and were forced to surrender within a month. Many Patriots fled to France or the Southern Netherlands, or went underground by forming "reading clubs", that ostensibly convened to discuss books, but actually were about politics. The Orange regime was restored and would survive until the Batavian Revolution of January 1795, supported by Revolutionary France's invading armies with many exiled Patriots amongst their ranks.
