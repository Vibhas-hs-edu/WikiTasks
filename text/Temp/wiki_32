Walter Lewis Baily, Jr.

Walter Lewis Baily, Jr. (born July 5, 1930 in Waynesburg, Pennsylvania; d. January 15, 2013 in Northbrook, Illinois) was an American mathematician.
Walter Baily's research focused on areas of algebraic groups, modular forms and number-theoretical applications of automorphic forms. One of his significant works was with Armand Borel, now known as the Baily–Borel compactification, which is a compactification of a quotient of a Hermitian symmetric space by an arithmetic group (that is, a linear algebraic group over the rational numbers). Baily and Borel built on the work of Ichirō Satake and others.
Baily was a winner of the 1952 Putnam Mathematics Competition. He studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), receiving a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics in 1952, after which he attended Princeton University, receiving a Masters in 1953 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics in 1955 under the direction of his thesis advisor Kunihiko Kodaira ("On the Quotient of a Complex Analytic Manifold by a Discontinuous Group of Complex Analytic Self-Homomorphisms"). Subsequently, he was an instructor at Princeton and then MIT. In 1957 he worked as a mathematician at Bell Laboratories. In 1957, he was appointed Assistant Professor and subsequently promoted to Professor in 1963 at the University of Chicago. He became a Professor Emeritus at the University of Chicago in 2005.
He was a member of the American Mathematical Society and the Mathematical Society of Japan. He often visited the University of Tokyo as a guest of Shokichi Iyanaga and Kunihiko Kodaira, spoke fluent Japanese and in Tokyo, 1963 married Yaeko Iseki, with whom he had a son. He owned an apartment in Tokyo for many years where he spent his summers. In addition, he often visited Moscow and Saint Petersburg and spoke fluent Russian.
He was awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship in 1958. In 1962, he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians held in Stockholm ("On the moduli of Abelian varieties with multiplications from an order in a totally real number field").
His doctoral students include Paul Monsky, Timothy J. Hickey and Daniel Bump.

Giuseppe Danise

Giuseppe Danise (11 January 1882 – 9 January 1963) was an Italian operatic baritone. He sang to great acclaim throughout Italy and the Americas, appearing in lyric and dramatic roles from the Italian, French, Wagnerian, and Russian repertoire.
Education and early career.
Danise was born in Salerno, near Naples, to Pasqualina Capaldo, an amateur musician, and Enrico Danise, an official in the Italian government. Though he began studies in law, he was urged to take up a career in singing, as he had a natural singing voice. He attended the Conservatorio di San Pietro a Majella in Naples, where he was trained first by Luigi Colonnese, a baritone of the previous generation whose own pedagogical lineage included Alessandro Busti and the castrato Girolamo Crescentini. According to Danise, for the first year he was only allowed to sing tones—no scales and no songs. Studies with Abramo Petillo followed. Danise's first daughter, Floria, was born in 1905. A son, Enrico, was to follow in 1907.
In 1906, he made his debut at the Teatro Bellini in Naples as Alfio in "Cavalleria rusticana". Shortly thereafter he was hired as a leading baritone of the Gonsalez Opera Company, a touring company that traveled through the Balkans and throughout Russia and Siberia, as was described by the soprano Germana Di Giulio in Lanfranco Rasponi's "The Last Prima Donnas". For at least part of the tour, the company included, among others, tenor Alessandro Procacci, soprano Giulietta Battaglioli, lyric soprano Ernestina Gonsalez, and bass Ignazio Cesari. In the course of his two and a half years with this company, Danise sang 630 performances.
He returned to Italy in May 1912. Two weeks later he sang a concert in Trieste and was engaged there for the fall season. After that, he was engaged to sing at the Teatro Regio di Torino. During that engagement he was asked to go to La Scala for the centennial of Verdi's birth. Danise refused this request over differences about the repertoire.
He continued building his Italian career to great success, singing in Bologna, Genoa, Rome, and Naples, among other places. He sang the role of Amonasro in Verdi's "Aida" at the opening of the Arena di Verona. In 1915 he performed at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in the world premiere of the opera "Una tragedia fiorentina" by Mario Mariotti.
From May 1914 through September 1915, Danise sang primarily in South America, in theatres in Uruguay, Brasil, and Argentina, such as the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires.
Back in Italy, the Italian arm of the HMV record company, La Voce del Padrone, made its first complete recording of Verdi's "Rigoletto" in May 1916, with Danise in the title role. Due to an unfortunate incident, however, some of the matrices were damaged before they made it to the fabrication process. The sections that were lost were re-recorded the following year with a different set of singers, Rigoletto being sung by Ernesto Badini. The complete but cobbled-together recording was issued in 1918 with the mixed cast.
Danise made his La Scala debut as the title role in the Scala premiere of Borodin's "Prince Igor". He enjoyed great success in that house, opening a season with Spontini's "Fernando Cortez" and taking part in the Scala premiere of Zandonai's "Francesca da Rimini" and in the world premiere of "Macigno" by Vittorio De Sabata. In 1918, at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome, he sang in the world premiere of Vincenzo Michetti's "Maria di Magdala".
Danise had to retire from the stage temporarily when he was conscripted to service in World War I. He was transferred from Milan to Rome, where he worked as a censor. During his stay in Rome, he sang at Teatro Costanzi (now known as the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma). It was at this time (1917–1918) that Danise first had occasion to sing with Beniamino Gigli, both performing in Cilea's "Adriana Lecouvreur".
North American career and Metropolitan Opera.
Danise was released from military duty on a special conscription. He traveled to Chile and stayed in South America and Latin America during a short period that he referred to as his "vagabondage". At this time the Metropolitan Opera's leading baritone, Pasquale Amato, was in decline. Danise received a letter from Giulio Gatti-Casazza, then the general manager of the company.
Danise made his debut at Metropolitan Opera in the role of Amonasro in "Aida". There he starred in the Met premiere of Giordano's "Andrea Chénier", Catalani's "Loreley", Lalo's "Le roi d'Ys", and "La Habanéra" by Raoul Laparra. Over the next twelve years, he sang in 425 performances with the Met, sometimes traveling with the company to perform in other cities America—Philadelphia, Atlanta, and Cleveland chief among them. He was paired with the greatest singers of the age, including Emmy Destinn, Rosa Ponselle, Claudia Muzio, Amelita Galli-Curci, Giovanni Martinelli, Beniamino Gigli, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, and José Mardones.
From 1922 to 1931, he appeared every year at the Ravinia summer opera in Chicago.
In 1925, he married Ines Rognoni (a former ballerina at La Scala) in West New York, New Jersey. They later had two daughters, Aurora and Ebe. Also in 1925 the Supreme Court in Brooklyn issued an interlocutory decree of divorce to a Raffaela Danise. In lieu of alimony, Danise was made to pay her a complete financial settlement of $20,000.
From 1921 to 1927, Danise recorded dozens of arias, art songs, popular songs, and religious works for Brunswick Records. Most of them were done in the acoustic method, but a small handful of electrics show a voice of great sonority with an intense ring.
As a result of an economic crisis in 1932, the Metropolitan Opera began to reduce fees for its soloists, causing Danise not to renew his contract with the Metropolitan Opera.
He returned to Italy, performing again with great success at La Scala, now as Scarpia in "Tosca" and as Alfonso in Donizetti's "La favorita"; in 1933 at the Teatro Regio of Torino as Telramund in "Lohengrin" under Max von Schillings; as well as in 1933 at the Teatro Massimo Palermo as Scarpia; and in 1935 at the Teatro Carlo Felice Genova as Alfonso in "La favorita". In the years 1935–37 he performed at the Opera of Rio de Janeiro as Scarpia, as Rigoletto, as Gianciotto in "Francesca da Rimini", and as Germont père in "La traviata" alongside Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayão.
After retirement.
Danise and Sayão became companions, and he retired to look after her voice, career, and interests. In 1946, the two divorced their respective first spouses, were married in 1947, and then settled in the United States. While they maintained a summer home ("Casa Bidu") in Camden, Maine, their usual home was at the Ansonia Hotel in New York City, where Danise opened a voice studio. He taught, among others, Regina Resnik (guiding her from soprano to mezzo-soprano), baritone Giuseppe Valdengo, Barry Morrell (guiding him from baritone to tenor), and bass Bonaldo Giaiotti.
Danise is buried next to Sayão's mother at the Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City.

Fred Guttenberg

Fred Guttenberg (born December 24, 1965) is an American activist against gun violence. His 14-year-old daughter Jaime Guttenberg was killed in the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting on February 14, 2018. His son, Jesse, also a student at the school, ran from the shooting to meet him at a nearby store. He learned about his daughter's death from a friend who is a Coral Springs SWAT officer. Jessica McBride, for the website "Heavy" described him as "one of the strongest voices for changes to gun laws in the wake of the mass shooting."
Activism.
The day after the shooting, Guttenberg spoke out for gun control, stating "Don't tell me there's no such thing as gun violence. It happened in Parkland". Before the nationally televised CNN town hall he criticized the President for not saying guns are a problem in a White House listening session, saying "My daughter was hunted last week" and "'I am enraged". During the CNN town hall he confronted Florida Senator Marco Rubio for his position on guns.
According to a report in "The Guardian", Guttenberg's priorities include raising the minimum age to buy guns, adding a waiting period before gun sales, having a no-loopholes policy for a mandatory background check of the gun buyer, and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines and bump stocks. While he would prefer that assault-style weapons were banned entirely, he believes that given the current political reality, that such a ban would be unlikely to ever happen, and accordingly he is advocating for measures to reduce gun violence which have a realistic chance of passage.
He told the "Tampa Bay Times" in March 2018 he has dedicated the rest of his life to fighting for gun safety.
NRA.
He is a staunch critic of the National Rifle Association as well as its spokesperson Dana Loesch, and he criticized the NRA advertisement entitled "Time Is Running Out", saying if a terrorist organization released a similar video, the terror threat level would raise. He told lawmakers that "All our legislators who stand with the NRA, they’re standing with a terrorist group." He called on President Donald Trump to address threats made against survivors and their families and demand such behavior stop.
Guttenberg noted that guns were prohibited by the Secret Service at the NRA convention in Dallas when vice president Mike Pence is scheduled to speak, and criticized the decision as hypocritical. Guttenberg said:
Political.
In early March 2018 he traveled to Washington to speak at a US Senate hearing about taking steps to prevent further violence. While in the Washington area he spoke at a town hall in Alexandria, Virginia. Guttenberg's advocacy has been characterized by his refusal to sit down, with Democratic Florida Senator Bill Nelson explaining that Guttenberg "cannot talk about this sitting down."
A candidate for Florida's 22nd congressional district, Javier Manjarres, wrote on social media in July 2018, "C'mon Fred...stop exploiting her death in the name of some political agenda...your daughter was shot by some lunatic who had an AR-15, not by the gun itself. #Fixit #VoteJavi". Guttenberg responded that he would do everything possible to make sure that Manjarres would not "sniff the halls of Congress", and that "If you call honesty around gun safety exploitation, then you clearly have a political agenda."
On September 4, 2018, at a hearing for the Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination, Guttenberg introduced himself to Kavanaugh, who looked at him, but turned away without shaking his hand. The encounter was the basis of a written question from the senators, to which Kavanaugh wrote that he did not recognize Guttenberg after having had a "chaotic morning".
Guttenberg criticized Kavanaugh's response, calling it "less than genuine".
On February 4, 2020, Guttenberg was invited to attend President Trump's State of the Union address. During the speech, Guttenberg attempted to shout over the President, and was asked to leave. The following day he apologized for the outburst, saying he let his emotions get the best of him.
Guttenberg met with Ted Cruz and Alyssa Milano to discuss gun violence. He said this was "a really important day."
Legal.
In May 2018, Guttenberg and another parent whose child was killed in the massacre filed lawsuits against American Outdoor Brands, a company that makes the AR-15 assault rifle, and Sunrise Tactical Supply, a store that sold the weapon to the shooter, as being "complicit in the attack" that resulted in 17 deaths. The lawsuit is the first step in an effort to challenge a 2001 Florida law that protects gun makers and gun sellers from such lawsuits.
Personal life.
Guttenberg is a real estate agent and auto broker in Parkland, Florida. Guttenberg grew up in a Conservative Jewish home and is a Reform Jew as an adult. He struggled with his faith after his daughter's death; he ceased attending synagogue but remained on good terms with his rabbi.

Amanecer is an album by Joey Calderazzo. It was recorded in 2006 and released by Marsalis Music.
Recording and music.
The album was recorded in January and February 2006. Most of the nine tracks are played by Calderazzo alone on piano. He is joined by guitarist Romero Lubambo for "The Lonely Swan", and by vocalist Claudia Acuña for "So Many Moons". All three play on "Amanecer" and "Lara".
Release and reception.
"Amanecer" was released by Marsalis Music in 2007. The AllMusic reviewer wrote that "Every selection on this well-conceived project has its purpose and is memorable in its own way." "The Penguin Guide to Jazz" suggested that the presence of Lubambo and Acuña merely diluted the effect of what is otherwise a solo piano album. The "JazzTimes" wrote that it "might be the album that gets his gifts as both a composer and a solo pianist embraced on a greater scale."

Kiba Hydroelectric Power Station

Kiba Hydroelectric Power Station is a proposed hydroelectric power station in Uganda.
Location.
The power station would be located on the Nile River, downstream of Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station, but upstream of Murchison Falls. This location is in Nwoya District, in the Northern Region of Uganda, approximately , upstream of the boundary of Murchison Falls National Park.
Kiba is approximately , above sea level, and marks the point where the Kiba River enters the Nile.
Overview.
The government of Uganda commissioned a study, titled "Project for Master Plan Study on Hydropower Development in the Republic of Uganda", that was conducted by "Electric Power Development Company Limited" and "Nippon Koei Company Limited", which was funded by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), in 2009. In the report of that study, published in 2011, three large hydroelectric power stations were identified for immediate envelopment, in the 2013 to 2023 time-frame, namely Isimba Hydroelectric Power Station, Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station and Ayago Hydroelectric Power Station. Two other stations were identified for development in the medium term, after the first three, namely Oriang Hydroelectric Power Station (400 megawatts), and Kiba Power Station (initially 200 megawatts).
Project development.
On 27 May 2015 the government of Uganda signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with "China Africa Investment and Development Company" (CAIDC), calling for a detailed feasibility study that would lead to a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) agreement for the Kiba Hydroelectric Power Project and the associated transmission line works. In July 2017, more than two years from the MoU, with no tangible progress, the Uganda Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development terminated the MoU. If this dam is to be built, a new investor will have to be sourced.
Other considerations.
The JICA report outlined a possible phased approach, where the power station is built over a number of years and commissioned in phases, to conserve resources and avoid building over-capacity.

1976 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy elected its seventh delegation to the Italian Senate on June 20, 1976. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1976 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
Lombardy obtained three more seats to the Senate, following the redistricting subsequent to the 1971 Census.
The election was won by the centrist Christian Democracy, as it happened at national level. Seven Lombard provinces gave a majority or at least a plurality to the winning party, while the agricultural Province of Pavia and Province of Mantua preferred the Italian Communist Party.
Background.
The Italian Communist Party, which had annexed the Italian Socialist Party of Proletarian Unity, strengthened under Enrico Berlinguer's leadership, reducing the gap with the Christian Democracy, which by its part obtained some votes from minor forces, as the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Democratic Socialist Party, to face the red rising.
Electoral system.
The electoral system for the Senate was a strange hybrid which established a form of proportional representation into FPTP-like constituencies. A candidate needed a landslide victory of more than 65% of votes to obtain a direct mandate. All constituencies where this result was not reached entered into an at-large calculation based upon the D'Hondt method to distribute the seats between the parties, and candidates with the best percentages of suffrages inside their party list were elected.

List of Paralympic medalists in snowboarding

Snowboarding is a Paralympic sport that is contested at the Winter Paralympic Games. Snowboarding was first introduced with snowboard cross a part of the Alpine skiing discipline at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. At the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, events were held in 2 disciplines — snowboard cross and banked slalom — in 2 categories for women and 3 categories for men.
A total of 12 gold medals, 12 silver medals and 12 bronze medals have been awarded since 2014 and have been won by skiers from 10 National Paralympic Committees (NPC).
Medal table.
The ranking in the table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and will be consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table will be ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a "nation" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code.

Greyhound (film)

Greyhound is a 2020 American war film directed by Aaron Schneider and starring Tom Hanks, who also wrote the screenplay. The film is based on the 1955 novel "The Good Shepherd" by C. S. Forester, and also stars Stephen Graham, Rob Morgan, and Elisabeth Shue. The plot follows a commander of the US Navy on his first war-time assignment in command of a multi-national escort group defending a merchant ship convoy under attack by submarines in early-1942 during the Battle of the Atlantic, only months after the U.S. officially entered World War II.
"Greyhound" was initially scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States on June 12, 2020, by Sony Pictures Releasing, but was eventually cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic after previously being delayed indefinitely. The distribution rights were then sold to Apple TV+, which released the film digitally on July 10, 2020. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the action sequences and effective use of the 90-minute runtime. At the 93rd Academy Awards, the film earned a nomination for Best Sound.
Plot.
During the Battle of the Atlantic, convoy HX-25, consisting of 37 Allied ships, is making its way to Liverpool. The convoy's escort consists of the USS "Keeling", radio call sign "Greyhound", captained by Commander Ernest Krause of the United States Navy; the British Tribal-class destroyer HMS "James", call sign "Harry"; the Polish "Grom"-class destroyer ORP "Viktor", call sign "Eagle"; and the Canadian , HMCS "Dodge", call sign "Dicky". Krause is overall commander of the escort ships, but despite his seniority and extensive naval education, it is his first wartime command.
The convoy enters the "Black Pit"—the Mid-Atlantic gap where they will be out of range of protective air cover. High-frequency direction finding from the convoy flagship intercepts several German transmissions, indicating the presence of U-boats. Greyhound identifies a surfaced sub heading towards the convoy and moves to attack. The submarine tries to slip under Greyhound, but Krause maneuvers his ship above the U-boat and sinks it with a full pattern of depth charges.
The crew's jubilation is cut short as they soon receive reports of distress rockets at the rear of the convoy. A Greek merchant ship was attacked by another U-boat and is quickly sinking. Krause moves Greyhound to assist, evading torpedoes fired at his ship with careful maneuvering. The surviving Greek sailors are rescued, and Greyhound returns to the convoy just as the bridge receives multiple messages from the other escorts: a wolfpack consisting of six U-boats is staying just out of firing range of the convoy; Krause suspects they are waiting for nightfall, when the escorts will have no visibility. The attack commences that evening with five merchant ships being torpedoed and sunk. One U-boat torpedoes an oil tanker and escapes Greyhound by using an underwater decoy, tricking the crew into wasting most of their remaining depth charges. Krause chooses to rescue survivors from the burning oil tanker rather than go to the aid of the other ships first.
The next day, the wolf pack targets Greyhound. The captain of the lead submarine taunts the convoy and its escorts via radio transmission. Krause learns that Greyhound is down to just six depth charges. The U-boats launch multiple torpedo runs, which Greyhound is barely able to evade. Greyhound and Dicky combine to sink one of the U-boats in an exchange of surface broadsides. Dicky receives minor damage due to the close range of the engagement and Greyhound is hit on the port side by one of the U-boat's deck guns, which kills Krause's mess attendant, George Cleveland, and two sailors. During the funeral service, Eagle is attacked and eventually sinks. Krause, aware that doing so might expose the shoddy state of the escort fleet, elects to break radio silence by transmitting a single word, "help", to the Admiralty.
With the convoy close to reaching air cover, the remaining U-boats mount an all-out assault on the destroyers. After heavy fighting, Greyhound sinks the lead U-boat with a full broadside. Air support deployed from British RAF Coastal Command arrives and Greyhound fires to mark the last visible U-boat, allowing a PBY Catalina bomber to sink the sub. The rest of the pack quickly flees before they can be discovered.
While assessing damage, Krause receives radio contact from the head of the relief escorts, HMS "Diamond", that his relief has arrived and Greyhound is due for repair and refitting in Derry alongside his two surviving companion vessels. The crew receives a "job well done" on their four U-boat kills. While setting the new course, passengers and crew of the remaining convoy ships cheer to salute Greyhound's crew while Krause retires to his cabin to rest.
Production.
It was announced in September 2016 that Tom Hanks was writing a screenplay about a World War II navy destroyer. Hanks would also star in the film. In February 2017, Aaron Schneider was brought on to direct, and Sony Pictures acquired the distribution rights.
Pre-production photography took place in January 2018 at sea on board HMCS "Montréal", a frigate of the Royal Canadian Navy. In March 2018, Stephen Graham, Elisabeth Shue, Rob Morgan, Karl Glusman, and Manuel Garcia-Rulfo were cast, and filming had commenced in Louisiana, aboard USS "Kidd" in Baton Rouge.
Release.
"Greyhound" was initially scheduled to be theatrically released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing under its Columbia Pictures label on March 22, 2019, before being delayed to May 8, 2020, and finally June 12, 2020.
Like many other films, it was then removed from the release schedule in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Hanks himself had been diagnosed with COVID-19 earlier that month while filming "Elvis" for Warner Bros.. In May 2020, it was announced Apple TV+ had acquired distribution rights to the film for about $70 million; Stage 6 Films was left as the sole Sony distributor as of the release of the film. It was released digitally by the service on July 10, 2020. Apple said that the film had the biggest debut weekend of any program in the platform's history, with "Deadline Hollywood" saying the figures were "commensurate with a summer theatrical box office big hit". In November, "Variety" reported the film was the 24th-most watched straight-to-streaming title of 2020 up to that point.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 78% based on 223 reviews, with an average rating of 6.50/10. The website's critics consensus reads: ""Greyhound"s characters aren't as robust as its action sequences, but this fast-paced World War II thriller benefits from its efficiently economical approach." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Owen Gleiberman, in his review for "Variety", said the film is "less a drama than a tense and sturdy diary of the logistics of battle" and "though much of the action is set in the open air of the ship's command perch, "Greyhound" often feels like a submarine thriller: tense, tight, boxed-in." Writing for the "Chicago Tribune", Michael Phillips gave the film three out of four stars and said: "Like the canine, ["Greyhound" is] trim, narrow of scope, and it runs efficiently and well despite a barrage of on-screen time stamps and vessel identification markers."
David Ehrlich of "IndieWire" gave the film a "C−" and wrote: "A terse and streamlined dad movie that's shorter than a Sunday afternoon nap and just as exciting, "Greyhound" bobs across the screen like a nuanced character study that's been entombed in a 2,000-ton iron casket and set adrift over the Atlantic. The film offers a handful of brief hints at the tortured hero who Forester invented for his book... but the whole thing is far too preoccupied with staying afloat to profile the guy at the helm in any meaningful way."

Olea Marion Davis

Olea Marion Davis (May 20, 1899 – 1977) (née Montgomery) was a Canadian artist and craftsperson who worked in architecture and decorative art as well as sculpture and pottery. Her sculptural and ceramic work was exhibited in Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton, as well as at the Brussel's World Fair (Expo '58) in 1958 and the Ostende International Show in 1959. Her architectural commissions include friezes, ornamental grills and screens, and lighting fixtures for locations such as the Hotel Vancouver and Pier B.C. in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her work is included in the permanent collection of the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C.
Early life and education.
Davis was born in Buffalo, New York to Canadian parents. She graduated from McGill University with a diploma in Physical Education. From there, she studied at the École des beaux-arts in Montreal, the Ontario College of Art (now OCAD University) in Toronto, the Extension Department of the University of British Columbia, and the Vancouver School of Art (now Emily Carr University of Art and Design), where she learned from Canadian sculptor Charles Marega.
Davis married Henry Landerkin Roy Davis in 1926 and shortly after, the couple moved from Quebec to British Columbia.
Professional projects.
Hotel Vancouver.
In the spring of 1939, Davis was one of several artists approached to execute decorative work for the Hotel Vancouver. Davis was recommended by the Vancouver Art Gallery to the Ornamental Bronze Co., which showed sample models of Davis' work to the hotel architect. Davis received a commission to create ornamental grills for the hotel. She produced clay and plaster models which were then sent to a foundry so that the metalwork could be cast in large quantities. The ornamental grills and light fixtures were installed around the tops of the walls in several large public rooms and halls in the building.
The decoration of the Hotel Vancouver was rushed to ensure that all work was completed by May 1939, in time for the Royal Visit, when King George VI and Queen Elizabeth stopped in Vancouver on the westbound portion of the 1939 Royal Tour.
Other artists commissioned for this project include:
The decoration of the Hotel Vancouver was overseen by Chief Architect John Schofield, of Archibald and Schofield.
Pier B.C..
In her work for Pier B.C., Davis created rosettes which were added to the building as decorative detail for supporting chains to the marquee.
Potter's Guild of B.C..
An educator and strong advocate for the standardization and development of ceramic arts in British Columbia, Davis was the founder and first president of the BC Potter's Guild in 1955. Through her work with the Guild, she started summer schools, brought notable potters from around North America to teach workshops, and encouraged fellow artists to submit their work to juried international shows. She continued to work with the Guild until her death in 1977. Davis' efforts and contributions were subsequently recognized with the Olea Davis Memorial Award, which were launched in 1978.
Teaching.
For many years, Davis taught at the University of British Columbia, Department of Extension, Fine Arts Division. From the early 1950s until 1969, Davis was responsible for running the UBC Pottery Hut and taught pottery courses, which included classes taught by renowned international ceramicists.
Other.
Davis founded the Allied Officers Guild in B.C. during WWII.
The First World Congress of Craftsmen was held 8–19 June 1964 at Columbia University, where 942 conferees attended from 47 countries. One of the thirty delegates from Canada, Davis attended as a representative of both the Canadian Handicrafts Guild and the Canadian Guild of Potters.
Awards.
In 1937, Davis won the medal for sculpture in the B.C. Artists' Exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Souk Es Sabbaghine (Sfax)

Souk Es Sabbaghine (Arabic: سوق الصباغين ) or the dry cleaners market is one of the oldest souks of the medina of Sfax.
Etymology.
The souk got its designation from the dry cleaners who used to work there. Currently, it is called « "Souk Sidi Bou Chouaïcha" » with reference to a small mosque in it.
Localization.
This market is located in the north–south axis in the extension of Souk Errbaa near Souk El Haddadine and Bab Jebli. It is surrounded by Souk El Gazal to the north-west, and Souk El Bleghjiya to the south-east.
Description.
According to historians, Souk Es Sabbaghine had many workshops for dry cleaners and tanners.
However presently, the tanning and dyeing workshops have been moved to the outside of the medina, with fruits and vegetable traders instead occupying the center of the medina.

Misia Soul Jazz Session

Misia Soul Jazz Session (stylized as MISIA SOUL JAZZ SESSION) is the second extended play by Japanese singer Misia. It was released on July 26, 2017, through Ariola Japan. The album was entirely produced and arranged by Takuya Kuroda. It features reworked versions of her previous material with a soul-jazz arrangement, as well as two new songs and a cover of Kai Band's "Saigo no Yogisha", from the album "Kono Yoru ni Sayonara" (1977).
Background and release.
The idea of creating a record and holding a joint tour with Kuroda emerged after Misia collaborated with him for the Blue Note Jazz Festival in Japan 2016 tour, where they performed a whole set together with his band. The album mainly focuses on reworking select songs from Misia's catalogue, including the singles "Hi no Ataru Basho", "Believe" and "Orphans no Namida". Misia recorded two new tracks for the album, both written by Kiyoshi and composed by Kenji Hayashida. "Kuruzo Thrilling", a percussion-heavy brazilian jazz-inspired track, features Raúl Midón on the guitar, and on "Unmei Loop", Misia welcomes Marcus Miller, whom she first collaborated with impromptu during the Blue Note Jazz Festival in Japan 2016 concert on the song "Orphans no Namida". The album closes with "Saigo no Yogisha", a cover of the 1977 song by Kai Band. The song was recorded at the demand of Sanma Akashiya, to be used as the theme song to the Netflix original series "Jimmy: Aho Mitai na Honma no Hanashi", which he produced. The nine-track EP was issued in Blu-spec CD2 and the limited edition of the album was packaged in digipak format.
Promotion.
Starting on July 1, 2017, Misia, Kuroda and his band embarked on the seven-date concert tour Misia Summer Soul Jazz 2017 to promote the album, which culminated with the release of "Misia Soul Jazz Session". The new tracks included on the record both received commercial tie-ins: "Unmei Loop" serves as theme song to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows game "Nobunaga's Ambition: Taishi" (2017), while "Kuruzo Thrilling" was used by Wowow as its theme song to their 2018 LPGA Tour broadcasts.
Commercial performance.
"Misia Soul Jazz Session" entered the daily Oricon Albums Chart at number 8. It peaked the following day at number 7. The album debuted at number 11 on the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, with sales of 8,000 copies. "Misia Soul Jazz Session" also debuted on the "Billboard Japan" Hot Albums chart, at number 14, and on the Top Albums Sales chart, at number 10. The EP charted for nine weeks on the Oricon Albums Chart, selling a reported total of 14,000 copies during its run.

Residente discography

Puerto Rican rapper and songwriter Residente has released one studio album, two singles, and three music videos as soloist.
After 10 years working with his step-brother Eduardo Cabra "Visitante" on Calle 13, the group disbanded in 2015 and both members followed their respective careers solo. Residente took a DNA test that revealed his roots trace back to 10 different locations around the world, which inspired him to produce a studio album, a documentary, and a book released by Univision's Fusion Media Group under the same title "Residente". He wrote and recorded the project over the course of two years in the countries where his roots are, including Siberia, Moscow, China, the Caucasus, France, Spain, England, Armenia, South Ossetia, Antigua, Ghana, Burkina Faso, Niger, Serbia, and Puerto Rico.
His first solo album "Residente" was released on March 31, 2017 and includes the singles "Somos Anormales" and "Desencuentro". The album peaked at number three in the US Latin Albums and at number one in the US World Albums charts. Residente also made his solo directorial debut and directed three music videos for the record. "Residente" was elected the best Latin album of 2017 by the critics of "Billboard", as well as the 19th best album overall of the same year. It was also ranked 38th on "Rolling Stone"s 50 Best Albums of 2017 list.

Mireille Miller-Young

Mireille Miller-Young is an associate professor of feminist studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Her research explores race, gender, and sexuality in visual culture and sex industries in the United States.
Miller-Young holds a PhD in American History from New York University.
She describes herself as an "academic pornographer", a term originally adopted by Sander Gilman.
Miller-Young is currently working on a documentary film on black women in the porn industry.
"A Taste for Brown Sugar".
Miller-Young's 2004 PhD dissertation examines the history of black women in pornography with ethnographic methods. Called "A Taste for Brown Sugar: The History of Black Women in American Pornography", the dissertation was hailed as "pioneering"
and was published as a book in 2014.
Reviewers have described the book as "masterful"
and lauded its "rigorous scholarship".
It has been described as "a remarkable text that applies critical race studies, feminist studies, sexuality studies, and film studies to Black women in pornography" and as a "must read" that is "deftly building" on the work of feminist scholars such as Angela Davis, Saidiya Hartman, and Celine Parrenas Shimizu.
It won National Women's Studies Association and American Studies Association book awards in 2015.
Criminal case.
Miller-Young became known to a wider audience in 2014 when she assaulted a pair of teenage anti-abortion activists on campus, stealing and later destroying one of their signs. In her interview with police, Miller-Young said she felt "triggered" by the sign and had a "moral right" to remove the material from sight.
Miller-Young was charged with grand theft, battery, and vandalism. She pleaded no contest and was sentenced to 108 hours of community service and three years of probation. She was also ordered to pay restitution and attend anger management classes.
The case attracted widespread attention and precipitated think pieces from all over the political spectrum.
The UCSB Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs, Michael Young, published a letter on the incident that was interpreted as a rebuke to both sides involved in the altercation.
More than 30 professors from universities across the nation signed a letter of support for Miller-Young, describing her as a "gentle, brilliant mentor" who was a "victim of the cultural legacy of slavery"; she "fell victim to the graphic nature of the anti-abortion display [because] she [was] pregnant".
A column in the Los Angeles Times called Miller-Young a "sucker" who had walked into an obvious trap.

Doppelganger (Arrow)

"Doppelganger" is the fifteenth episode of the sixth season, and 130th episode overall of The CW series "Arrow". The episode sees the return of former main character Roy Harper (Colton Haynes). It also sees the return of Thea donning her Speedy suit since the ninth episode of the fifth season. The episode stars Stephen Amell (Oliver Queen) who is joined by fellow main cast members David Ramsey (John Diggle), Emily Bett Rickards (Felicity Smoak), Katie Cassidy (Black Siren), Paul Blackthorne (Quentin Lance), Willa Holland (Thea Queen), Echo Kellum (Curtis Holt) and Juliana Harkavy (Dinah Drake). Main cast member Rick Gonzalez (Rene Ramirez) is also credited but does not appear in this episode.
Synopsis.
The episode starts with Jean Loring, Oliver's solicitor in his impending trial coming to him hopeful that she could get the charges against him dropped due to Rene's testimony being illegally obtained. Quentin then walks in to inform Oliver that Laurel Lance / Black Siren from Earth-2 is posing as Earth-1's deceased Laurel Lance much to the disbelief of Oliver and Thea. Oliver, Thea and Quentin go to the Star City Police Department in the hope to stop Laurel from speaking to the press but they are too late. Meanwhile Curtis visits Rene's daughter Zoe to explain to her what happened to her father. In a meeting with the Star City district attorney, he reveals to Jean and Oliver that they are no longer using Rene's testimony and instead using Roy Harper's. After learning that Roy is the witness, Felicity Smoak and John Diggle discuss the situation with Thea and Oliver. After Laurel is taken from the hospital Dinah and Quentin find that there is corrupt officers in the police department who takes her to Anatoly Kynazev. Oliver and Diggle fight about Oliver being the Green Arrow again. Thea decides to go back out to the field to save Roy, she successfully gets into the hotel room where Roy is being held and kisses him after watching him get tortured. When SWAT shows up to the hotel, Oliver pulls Thea out to save Roy later. Dinah and Quentin are tasked to find the corrupt police officers in the department. When Laurel tells them that Diaz has Roy and where he is, Oliver, Thea and Diggle get ready to go after him. Dinah offers to join them, but Oliver declines her offer due to trust issues. After Roy is rescued, he and Thea go to bed and they were being watched by an unknown person.
Production.
In December 2017, it was announced that Colton Haynes was returning as his character of Roy Harper after an absence since his last guest appearance in "Unchained" since leaving in the third season. Arrow executive producers said, "We’re thrilled to announce that Colton Haynes will be reprising his role as Roy Harper. Roy is called back to Star City to help resolve an urgent matter with high stakes for the team. His short visit turns into something surprising when he reunites with Thea and sparks a change in both of their lives that will have long-lasting consequences…." It was also revealed that he would have a short arc beginning in this episode.
Reception.
Jesse Schedeen of IGN rated the episode 7.0 and said about the episode "I was thrilled when it was announced that Haynes would be returning as Roy Harper this season. Haynes’ presence has been missed on the show in recent years, both because he was a memorable part of the Team Arrow dynamic in Seasons 2 and 3 and because Thea never really made for a satisfying replacement in the vigilante sidekick department." He added "It was also nice seeing Diaz actually demonstrate his martial arts prowess for a change. In the comics, Richard Dragon is one of a small handful of post-Batman-level martial artists, and it’s about time we started to get a sense of the physical powerhouse he can be. Hopefully we’ll see some good Diaz/Ollie fisticuffs in the near future." Schedeen finished the review with "This week's Arrow is a clear good news/bad news situation. The long-awaited return of Roy Harper amounted to very little, begging the question of why he was brought back into the picture in the first place. But the renewed focus on Ricardo Diaz is beginning to help turn around this season's overarching conflict. The question is whether there's enough time left to truly take advantage of this status quo upheaval."
Marc Buxton of Den of Geek said in his review "this is the first episode where I really felt Diaz as a force to be reckoned with. Cayden James was an effective villain but since the twist of Diaz murdering James went down, Diaz has been so much background noise. But Diaz's torture of Roy really elevates the villain." A writer for Express Newsline, commented about this episode by saying "Right from the start of this episode, it quickly becomes clear that this Arrow episode will be a rough one for Oliver Queen. (Ignoring the season 5 episode where she tried to trick Ollie she was the real Laurel.) Yet the brilliance of this plot is how it puts Black Siren in such close quarters with Oliver and the gang. It's easy to forget just how much this show has changed and evolved over the past few years, but tossing Roy back into the ensemble really drove the point home. Now, she has escaped and is ready to resume her old life." They also added "It was nice seeing Thea back in her Speedy uniform."
Nicholas Graff of Sciencefiction.com said "Well, this was one of the episodes we had been waiting for this season, the long-awaited return of Roy Harper to ‘Arrow,’ and I can say it was not exactly what I had expected. Some of the side-stories seemed a bit more interesting, and it definitely felt like a bit too open-ended (I know there’s a second half to it coming along in 2 weeks), so I am honestly not sure exactly how I felt about the episode." He ended his review by saying "Solid episode, always good to see Roy, though I kind of wish he was back in a more permanent fashion, and I was kind of hoping to see him suit up and go out and fight with the team again, like old times (though at least they put him in a red hoodie at the end, that was a nice-callback). I like where the show is going, though I think I want to see some closure or something on the split team storyline soon before they go to all-out war with Diaz and his SCPD goons. And I’m definitely not happy that we have a break next week before the second half of the Roy arc. Ah well, see you back here in 2 weeks!"

Mongko Region Defence Army

The Mongko Region Defence Army (; abbreviated MRDA) was an insurgent group based in Mongko, Shan State, Myanmar. The then-ruling military junta in Myanmar, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), allegedly encouraged the MRDA to cooperate with narcos on the China–Myanmar border.
History.
In August 1995, Mong Hsala announced his split with Yang Maoliang and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), and renamed a brigade under his command to the Mongko Region Defence Army (MRDA). Immediately afterwards, the group signed a ceasefire with the government of Myanmar.
In September 2000, deputy commander Li Nimen mutinied and ousted Mong Hsala from the group, with support from Kokang leader Peng Jiasheng, who had ousted Yang Maoliang from the MNDAA several years prior. After Li Nimen attempted to ambush government soldiers stationed around Mongko, the Tatmadaw launched Operation "Black Dragon", capturing, disarming and executing Li Nimen and most of his men. The remaining members of the MRDA were forcibly enlisted into the Myanmar Army and the group was dissolved.

Romeo Mathieu

Romeo Mathieu, (1917 – April, 1989) was a Canadian trade unionist, progressive political activist, and leading solidarity builder for the Quebec labour movement.
Mathieu is best associated with his leading role in expanding the efforts of the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA) into Quebec during the 1940s and 50s, and assisting with the merger between the UPWA and the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America in 1968. 
He also made a significant contribution to the creation of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union in 1979. In addition to his outstanding contributions to the labour movement, Mathieu was a standing member of the Quebec "intelligensia" during the 1950s and 60s, and served as a formidable presence in advancing many of the province's social movements, including the Quiet Revolution.
Early life.
Mathieu was born in Montreal, Quebec in 1917 and displayed a hunger for politics at an early age. Unlike most other boys in Quebec during this period, Mathieu demonstrated little to no interest in hockey or sports in general. Instead, he became a political animal and strove to be his uncle's protege, who was a professional organizer for the Liberal Party of Canada.
He was educated at the Technical Institute of Montreal, where he learned mechanics and technical drawing, and graduated on the eve of the Great Depression. The experiences of the Great Depression had a profound impact on Mathieu, resulting in a paradigm shift for his worldview, political beliefs and associations. Soon thereafter, he abandoned his childhood affiliation to the Liberal Party, and, instead, embraced the emerging, and more radical, views of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF).
Packinghouse worker organizing.
One day in 1938, while taking a lunch break from his job in the credit department of a Montreal store, a curious, young Romeo Mathieu dropped into a union meeting, and listened to an organizer from the garment workers. From then on his life was with the labour movement.
His first project was organizing workers at the Dominion Engineering Works in Longueuil, Quebec for the International Association of Machinists. The organizing drive was successful, and the new local union elected Mathieu as its full-time president.
Mathieu soon made a name for himself in Quebec's labour circles, and rapidly gained a reputation for being a highly effective and, indeed, fierce union mobilizer. Before long, he became active in the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada (TLC), eventually serving on the federation's executive during the mid-1940s.
TLC president Percy Bengough took special notice of Mathieu and recommended him to lead the federation's nascent organizing strategy, and corresponding campaign, for packinghouse workers. Mathieu excelled at the challenge and helped create Montreal's first packinghouse workers' union, the Packinghouse Butchers and Allied Workers Union, which was chartered with the TLC.
Naturally, Romeo Mathieu served as the new union's first leader.
Master bargaining in meat sector.
Mathieu was a staunch supporter of the "One Industry, One Union" movement and in 1946 he led the Packinghouse Butchers and Allied Workers Union toward a merger with the United Packinghouse Workers of America (UPWA).
Always keen to put the full might of the UPWA to the cause, Mathieu led the negotiating committee that struck the "big three" of Canada's meat packing industry: Canada Packers, Burns, and Swift in 1947. The action further secured the master bargaining model that was achieved for packinghouse workers during the Second World War. 
The model won through Mathieu's negotiating prowess and the leadership of UPWA Canadian Director Fred Dowling became the standard across Canada, and ushered in a new era of higher living standards for generations of packinghouse workers. The system survived until the mid-1980s when Burns triggered a decade long period of brinkmanship and excessively hard bargaining that resulted in some of the largest and most violent strikes in Canadian history, and ultimately led to the end of pattern bargaining in the country's meat sector.
Beyond the meat sector, Mathieu was often called upon by other unions or central labour federations to get the parties beyond impasse, including the nationwide postal strike in 1968, which was ultimately resolved by him after the Canadian Union of Postal Workers invited Romeo to act as their chief negotiator.
Building solidarity in Quebec.
Through the 1940s, dual federations and unions competed for affiliates and sectors, which thereby allowed employers to pit one union against another.
Mathieu, in addition to crafting mergers within his own unions and sectors, played a key role in merging Quebec's labour federations. In particular, he made a significant contribution to the creation, expansion and development of the province's main labour body, the Fédération des travailleurs et travailleuses du Québec (FTQ)/Quebec Federation of Labour (QFL).
The FTQ/QFL was the result of the 1957 merger of the Provincial Federation of Labour of Québec (PFLQ) and the Federation of Industrial Trade Unions of Québec (FITQ)/Fédération des unions industrielles du Québec (FUIQ), where Mathieu served as the secretary-general, and displayed tremendous leadership in spearheading the effort to bring the two federations together.
As the FTQ's first secretary-general, Mathieu helped orient the new Quebec labour federation toward the more militant approach favoured by the industrial unions of the FITQ (i.e., in contrast to the less militant approach of the craft unions of the PFLQ). Unlike other labour federations in the province, the FTQ kept its distance from the Maurice Duplessis government, took some militant stands – in keeping with its industrial tendencies – like the Murdochville Strike in 1957, and, eventually, supported the New Democratic Party of Canada, once it was founded in 1961.
Mathieu undoubtedly also played an important role in the creation of the Canadian Labour Congress in 1956, following the merger of the TLC and the Canadian Congress of Labour, where Romeo served on the executive council. From 1956 until his retirement in 1983, Mathieu served as a vocal and highly respected member of the CLC's executive board.
Quiet Revolution.
In the political arena, and in the leading intellectual and social movements of his day, Mathieu joined other young activist – such as Pierre Trudeau, Gérard Pelletier, Jean Marchand, Philippe Vaillancourt, Jean-Paul Lefebvre, and René Lévesque – in pushing for the fall of the Maurice Duplessis regime, and the rise of the Quiet Revolution, which began in the 1960s and left an indelible impact on Quebec.
Firmly committed to his belief that political action and trade unionism were, and must be, interwoven, Mathieu is quoted as saying. "A worker is every bit a citizen too and the two can never be separated. It is sheer irresponsibility for unions to concern themselves with only work-place problems."
Merging the food workers.
In keeping with Mathieu's lifelong commitment to the "One industry, one union" concept, he played a pivotal role in the merger between the United Packinghouse Workers of America and the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen of North America (AMCBW) in 1968, creating the Canadian Food and Allied Workers (CFAW) in Canada (for internal political reasons); however, in the United States UPWA ceased to exist as a brand, and its members became members of the AMCBW. Following the merger in Canada, the CFAW was led by the indefatigable Fred Dowling as its leader, and Mathieu serving as the obvious second-in-command and heir apparent. Upon Dowling's retirement in 1973, Mathieu became the leader of the CFAW, and, as such, the Canadian director of the AMCBW.
Six years later, Mathieu, once again, played a defining role in yet another major merger. This time with the creation of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union in 1979, which, in Quebec, would have relied upon Romeo's very seasoned and sage hand leading the way.
From 1979 until his retirement in 1983, Mathieu served the UFCW as an international vice-president, and as the director of region 18, which included all of the new union's Canadian members who once belonged the Amalgamated Meat Cutters.
Awards.
On October 5, 1983, Mathieu became one of very few labour leaders to be invested into the Order of Canada for his role as "the former regional director and vice-president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and founder of the Fédération des Unions industrielles du Québec. In recognition of nearly a half century of hard work on behalf of his union brothers and sisters as a labour leader and negotiator."
In appreciation for his role in creating the union – and the five decades of activism and commitment that helped make it possible – UFCW Local Unions in Canada, by way of the UFCW Canada national council, established an annual scholarship in Mathieu's honour, which every year awards 18 $1,000 scholarship prizes to UFCW Canada members or their children, toward post-secondary tuition and associated costs.
Romeo Mathieu died in Montreal in April, 1989.

Tsao Erh-chung

Tsao Erh-chung (; born 24 August 1954) is a Taiwanese politician. He was a member of the Legislative Yuan between 1993 and 2002, then served from 2005 to 2012.
Academic and early career.
Tsao attended Matsu High School, and graduated from Central Police University. He then worked for the Lienchiang County Police Department and was a lecturer at Taiwan Police College.
Political career.
Tsao helped reach what became the Kinmen Agreement, signed in 1990. He first won election to the Legislative Yuan in 1992, and represented the Lienchiang County Constituency until 2002. In 1999, during his third term, Tsao helped negotiate the return of the Taiwanese vessel Shin Hwa from China. He was a proponent of the three links, and believed that their establishment would aid economic development in the outlying islands of Taiwan. In 2001, Tsao visited Fujian as part of a pilgrimage for the goddess Mazu. He returned to China later that month to sign an unofficial agreement with government officials of Mawei District. The Mainland Affairs Council called the move a "person-to-person exchange" that "had no legal bearing," and warned neighboring Kinmen against a similar action. Subsequently, the MAC announced its Eight Noes" policy regarding exchanges with China. After Lee Yuan-tsu was prevented from attending APEC China 2001 as a representative of Taiwan's government, Tsao stated of the Kuomintang legislative caucus, "We agree with the government's decision not to participate in the APEC summit and condemn China's rough treatment of Taiwan's delegation that is already in Shanghai." Tsao lost reelection in December 2001. Before stepping down, he helped pass amendments to the Offshore Islands Development Act, permitting more Taiwanese to visit China via the outlying islands.
Tsao contested the 2004 legislative elections as an independent, and won. He was seated as a representative from Lienchiang County. A month after taking office, Tsao joined Kuomintang officials on a trip to China. He remained a staunch supporter of the three links, additionally backing landing visa privileges for Chinese visitors to Taiwan. Previously, in August 2005, he had spoken out against a planned reduction in military personnel stationed in the Matsu Islands. He proposed a full ban on land mines that December. Tsao defeated Lin Hui-kuan in the 2008 legislative elections. During this session, the Citizen Congress Watch ranked Tsao as one of the worst legislators. He began taking an interest in transportation, infrastructure, and civil order. Specifically, Tsao supported official designation of demonstration zones, and opposed the lax employment protections at free ports, as well as a proposal for Taoyuan International Airport to be exempt from most government oversight. Tsao later stated that Taiwanese nationals should be given preferential consideration for management positions at the airport because it is a state-owned enterprise. He was elected chair of the legislature's Transportation Committee alongside Lin Chien-jung in March 2009. Two months later, while discussing an amendment to the Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects that would permit Chinese investment in Taiwanese infrastructure projects, Tsao opined that the proposed change was legal. Upon hearing the statement, Democratic Progressive Party lawmakers prevented Tsao from taking his seat. He then adjourned the meeting and scheduled a second discussion which the DPP boycotted.
Tsao worked to market his constituency to tourists. He urged the government to place Chinese tourists under a free independent tourist policy, and defended them publicly on occasion. Tsao also pushed for more funding through the Offshore Islands Development Fund. In March 2011, Tsao proposed an amendment to the Act for the Development of Tourism that would allow chain convenience stores to sell tickets for maritime and air transportation. The motion passed and was implemented that same month. 
Tsao yielded his legislative seat to Chen Hsueh-sheng in 2012. After leaving the legislature, Tsao led the Chinese Taipei Road Running Association. In October 2017, Tsao became the first directly elected leader of the Kuomintang's Lienchiang County chapter.

Thomas D. Keizur

Thomas Dove Keizur (his name is incorrectly spelled Keizer, Keiser, Kaizur, Kaiser, Keysur, Keyser, Kizer, or Kisor in various documents) was one of the earliest American pioneers to settle in the Oregon Country. In 1843, he led his large family from Missouri to Oregon over the Oregon Trail. He homesteaded in Oregon's Willamette Valley in an area north of modern-day Salem, Oregon. Keizur was one of eight citizens elected to serve on Oregon's third pre-provisional legislative committee which helped lay the foundation for the establishment of the Oregon Territory. He was also the first captain of the Oregon Rangers, the first militia unit organized in Oregon. Today, the city of Keizer, Oregon, is named in his honor.
Early life.
Keizur was born on 20 November 1793 in Buncombe County, North Carolina. His parents were George A. and Mary (Dove) Keisur. Keizur married Mary Girley in 1812. Together, they had ten children, five boys and five girls.
In 1828, the Keizurs moved from North Carolina to Giles County, Tennessee. Five years later, he moved further west to Van Buren County, Arkansas.
In 1842, the Keizur family traveled to Missouri hoping to join an emigrant wagon train bound for the Oregon County. However, they arrived too late to start crossing the continent with that year's migration. As a result, the family spent a year in Missouri waiting for the 1843 wagon train to form up.
Oregon Trail.
Keizur and his family left Independence, Missouri, for Oregon on 20 May 1843. On the journey to Oregon, Keisur was joined by his wife, five sons, five daughters, two sons-in-law, eight grandchildren, and a brother of one of his sons-in-law.
There were over one hundred wagons and approximately 900 pioneers traveling west to Oregon in 1843. In addition, the pioneers brought a herd of 5,000 cattle that followed as the wagons moved along the trail. The trek was guided by Marcus Whitman, who was returning to his mission station on the Columbia River. To prevent over grazing along the route the pioneers divided into smaller traveling groups. The Keizurs joined what became known as the Applegate party, which traveled slowly with the cattle herd. Along the trail, Keiser became an active leader among the emigrants.
The Keizurs covered over on the Oregon Trail. First, their wagon train followed the Platte River and then headed north to Fort Laramie in Wyoming. From there, they followed the North Platte River and the Sweetwater River before crossing the continental divide at South Pass in central Wyoming. Once on the west side of the continental divide, the wagon train headed for Fort Bridger and then turned north to Fort Hall. From there, the party followed the Snake River and then the Columbia River to the Willamette Valley. It took six months for the Keizurs and their fellow emigrants to cross the continent.
Oregon pioneer.
The Keizur family arrived in the Willamette Valley in mid-November. They spent the winter in temporary quarters on the west bank of the Willamette River across from the Methodist mission station at Mill Creek which had been established by Jason Lee. In the spring of 1844, the family re-crossed the river and established a number claims on the west bank. The Keizur family land claims were north of the mission. In total, the adult members of the Keizur family claimed of farm land along the Willamette River.
Thomas Keizur himself claimed . He filed his claim under the provisional government's original land act. His property was bordered on the west by the Willamette River. To the north his land ended at Cummings Lane, a road that was built by the Keizur family. The eastern boundary was River Road and then Cheery Avenue heading south to what is today Salem Industrial Drive. The southern boundary ran from the junction of Cheery Avenue and Salem Industrial Drive west to the river. After Oregon became a United States territory, Keizur refiled his claim in accordance with the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850.
In 1844, Keizur was one of eight citizens elected to the Oregon Country's third pre-provisional legislative committee. He was one of the three representatives from the Champoeg district. This was the first legislative body in the Oregon Country selected in a regular election. Members of the two previous legislative committees were selected at open public meetings. The committee met twice. Both sessions were held in Oregon City. The first meeting was at the home of Felix Hathaway from 18 to 27 June 1844. The second meeting took place at the home of Doctor John E. Long from 16 to 21 December the same year. These meetings helped lay the foundation for the establishment of the Oregon Territory.
In 1844, a dispute between settlers and a local Indian lead to several deaths at Willamette Falls near Oregon City. After the deaths, a citizens committee of Willamette Valley residents met on 9 March 1844 to discuss forming a militia. The committee was chaired by W. H. Wilson with Keizur serving as the meeting secretary. The committee approved formation of a mounted rifle company to protect settlers. As a result, a militia company of 25 men, known as the Oregon Rangers, was organized. Keizur was elected captain of the company. Keizur was duly commissioned by the executive committee of Oregon's provisional government. This was the first military unit authorized and formed in the Oregon Country. The company met several times for training, but was not called into action.
In 1846, a special citizens meeting was held at the farm of Daniel Waldo to discuss the need for a militia company. Keizur was elected chairman of the meeting. Attendees voted reestablish the Oregon Rangers mounted rifle company. Charles Bennett was appointed captain of the company. After the meeting, 45 attendees volunteered to serve in the company. Keizur signed the meeting minute which were published in the "Oregon Spectator" newspaper.
During the 1851–1852 session of the Oregon Territorial Legislature Keizur and two other citizen were appointed to a commission tasked with determining the route of a territorial road between Lafayette in Yamhill County to Salem in Marion County. It appears that Keizur was unable to participate in the commission since records show that another citizen ended up serving in his place. When the proposed route was finally announced in 1853, Keizur and other Marion County residents signed a petition against building the road along the proposed route. As a result of the protest, the road was not built.
Keizur's wife, Mary, died in 1853. Keizur died on 19 June 1871 in Marion County, Oregon. He was 78 years old at the time of his death.
Legacy.
Keizur's service in the 1844 pre-territorial legislature helped lay the groundwork for Oregon's territorial government and eventual statehood. When he was elected captain of the Oregon Rangers, he became the state's first militia commander and thus the founding leader of what is today the Oregon National Guard.
The Keiser post office was established in 1948, as a Salem delivery station. On 2 November 1982, the city of Keizer was incorporated and named in honor of Thomas D. Keizur. At the time, the city's population was 19,650. The city continues to grow. As of 2016, the estimated population of Keizer was 38,980.
In 2010, a large bronze statue of Keizur on horseback was installed at the Keizer Civic Center. The statue honors Keizur for his service in pre-territorial legislature and as commander of the state's first military organization. It also recognized him as the founding father of the city of Keizer.
Keizur's last name is spelled incorrectly in various military documents, land deeds, state records, history books, and newspaper articles. Researchers have found 15 different spelling including Keizer, Keiser, Kaizur, Kaiser, Keysur, Keyser, Kizer, and Kisor. However, the correct spelling is Keizur.

Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg

The Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg (VAG; Nuremberg Transport Company) is the municipal company responsible for operating the U-Bahn, trams, and buses throughout the city of Nuremberg, in the state of Bavaria, Germany. VAG is a wholly owned subsidiary of "Städtischen Werke Nürnberg" ("Nuremberg Municipal Works"), and a member of the "Verkehrsverbund Großraum Nürnberg" (VGN; Integrated Transport Association of Greater Nuremberg).
History.
Nürnberg-Fürther Straßenbahn.
On April 12, 1881, entrepreneur Heinrich Alfes from Bremen received a charter for the manufacture and operation of a "Pferdebahn", a horse-drawn streetcar. The first line began operation on August 25, 1881, on the route Staatsbahnhof (current Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof) - Lorenzkirche - Plärrer - Bauerngasse. In 1883, the enterprise was reorganized into a private Aktiengesellschaft with the name Nürnberg-Fürther Straßenbahn-Gesellschaft, or Nuremberg-Fürth Streetcar Company. The company expanded to three lines, and between 1896 and 1898 all lines were electrified.
Municipal Ownership.
In 1903, the company was taken over by the city of Nuremberg and operated under the name Nürnberg-Fürther Straßenbahn. Under municipal ownership, the streetcar operation saw steady growth. Although growth slowed during the First World War and the Great Depression, by 1939 the network around Nuremberg and Fürth had reached 20 lines, including one express line. Busses were introduced in 1923 and expanded to 60 busses by 1929.
In 1934, all public works were combined under one organization, and the streetcar division was given the name "Städtische Werke Nürnberg, Abteilung Straßenbahn", or "Nuremberg Public Works, Streetcar Division". However, the streetcars continued to use signage with the name "Nürnberg-Fürther Straßenbahn" through 1981. In 1939, the public works were again reorganized as "Werke und Bahnen der Stadt der Reichsparteitage Nürnberg, Straßenbahn" ("Utilities and Trains of the City of the Reichsparty Nuremberg, Streetcars"). Immediately following the Second World War, the division was renamed "Werke und Bahnen der Stadt Nürnberg, Straßenbahn" ("Utilities and Trains Nuremberg, Streetcars"), and on December 1, 1945, it was combined into the "Städtische Werke Nürnberg – Verkehrsbetriebe" ("Nuremberg Municipal Works - Transport Operations"). During the war, 95% of the overhead wires were destroyed, along with all of the depots. The streetcar network was rebuilt completely by 1955, and streetcars were supplemented with trolleybusses starting in 1948.
Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg.
In 1959, the municipal utilities of Nuremberg were reorganized, and the Verkehrs-Aktiengesellschaft Nürnberg (VAG) was established as an independent enterprise, wholly owned by the Städtische Werke Nürnberg GmbH. The system busses started using the new VAG name immediately, although the streetcars still displayed the "Nürnberg-Fürther Straßenbahn" name until 1981.
Services.
Bus.
As of 2016, VAG operated 59 bus lines throughout Nuremberg. In addition to covering most areas within the city, 16 of the busses continue into neighboring areas including Fürth, Erlangen, and Schwabach. The city has designed many of the bus routes, and especially the Ring Lines, to feed commuters into other modes of public transportation such as streetcars, S-Bahn, and subway.
On weekend and holiday nights, VAG also operates the NightLiner in conjunction with the Erlanger Stadtwerke Stadtverkehr GmbH (ESTW), infra fürth verkehr gmbh (infra), and the Omnibusverkehr Franken (OVF). 28 NightLiner lines depart from the central Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof throughout the city and the surrounding region.
Trams.
The streetcar network of the VAG encompasses 5 lines and 79 stops over a track length of 36 km.
U-Bahn.
The three subway lines operating in Nuremberg cover a track length of 36 km. All three lines meet at the central stations of Nuremberg Hauptbahnhof and Plärrer.

De La Galette River

The De La Galette River (French: "Rivière de la Galette") is a tributary of the southern shore of Gouin Reservoir (Bouzanquet Bay), flowing into the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of the Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.
The "River Galette" flows successively in the townships of Fréchette and Delâge, south of the Gouin reservoir and the west side of the upper Saint-Maurice River. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
The route 400, connecting the Gouin Dam to the village of Parent, Quebec, serves the valley of "De La Galette River" bypassing the north-west Louis-Georges-Morin (altitude: ); this road also serves the peninsula which stretches north in the Gouin Reservoir on . Some secondary forest roads are in use nearby for forestry and recreational tourism activities.
The surface of the "De La Galette River" is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.

High school career.
Azubuike attended Potter's House Christian Academy in Jacksonville, Florida. His then assistant coach Harry Coxsome and his wife Donna took care of him and soon became his legal guardians. In his first high school game he was matched up against fellow future Kansas Jayhawk Joel Embiid. Azubuike was a four-year starter averaging 16.9 points and 9.7 rebounds per game his senior year. Azubuike was selected to play in the 2016 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, Jordan Brand Classic, and Nike Hoop Summit. He was also a member of the National Honor Society.
He was rated by Rivals.com as a five-star recruit and was ranked as the 27th best overall player while ESPN ranked him 22nd overall in the Class of 2016. Azubuike received offers from many universities including Duke, Texas, Kentucky, and shortened his final list of colleges to Florida State, Kansas, and North Carolina. On January 28, 2016, he announced his choice to play college basketball at the University of Kansas.
College career.
Freshman year.
In his freshman season he started in six of the 11 games he played in before tearing ligaments in his left wrist, which ended his season. Before the injury, he averaged 5.0 points, 4.4 rebounds, 1.6 blocks, and 62.9% field goal percentage.
Sophomore year.
For the 2017–2018 season, Kansas' coach Bill Self recruited Kansas football player James Sosinski to defend Azubuike during practice. Udoka started every game of the regular season but missed the Big 12 tournament after spraining his left MCL. He returned for the NCAA tournament until KU's loss to eventual champion Villanova in the Final Four. He averaged 13.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, 1.7 blocks, and led the nation with a 77% field goal percentage for the season. His field goal percentage broke the single-season record for Kansas and the Big 12 Conference. This high percentage was in part due to the majority of his field goals being slam dunks, which typically have a higher completion percentage than jump shots or layups. He had more dunks than any other college player going back to the 2009–2010 season. He was awarded All-Big 12 third team by the conference's coaches and second team by the AP.
On April 20, 2018, Azubuike announced his intention to the 2018 NBA Draft. He did not initially hire an agent, which would allow him to return before the combine. Azubuike was one of a record-high 69 prospects invited to the NBA Draft Combine that year. On May 17, he measured out to be a near 7' tall center (with shoes on) weighing in at 274 pounds and holding the second-longest wingspan at 7'7", behind only Mohamed Bamba. On May 30, 2018, he announced his intent to withdraw from the draft and return to Kansas for his junior season.
Junior year.
Azubuike was selected as an honorable mention to the 2018–2019 All-Big 12 preseason team. On December 4, 2018, he severely sprained his right ankle against Wofford and missed the following four games. On January 5, 2019, Azubuike injured his wrist during practice. An MRI revealed he tore a ligament in his right hand. He underwent season-ending surgery on January 9, 2019. 
Kansas won all nine games Azubuike played including against top ten teams Tennessee and Michigan State. He finished the season averaging 13.4 points and 6.8 rebounds.
On April 22, 2019, Azubuike announced he would return to Kansas for his senior season. According to KU coach Bill Self, “We’re all very excited about Udoka making the decision not to enter the [NBA] draft.” "Unfortunately for him, injury is the reason as he still cannot participate (at) what would be the NBA combine or workouts for the NBA teams."
Senior year.
Azubuike scored a career-high 29 points in a 90–84 overtime win over Dayton on November 27, 2019. On February 22, 2020, Azubuike scored 23 points and had a career-high 19 rebounds in a 64–61 win over top-ranked Baylor.
At the conclusion of the regular season, Azubuike was named the Big 12 Player of the Year. Azubuike averaged 13.7 points, 10.5 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game as a senior. Azubuike's career field goal percentage of 74.9% is the highest in NCAA history. 
Professional career.
Utah Jazz (2020–present).
Azubuike was selected with the 27th pick in the first round of the 2020 NBA draft by the Utah Jazz. On November 24, 2020, the Utah Jazz announced that they had signed Azubuike. Azubuike was assigned to the Jazz's NBA G League affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stars, for the start of the 2021 G League season, making his G League debut on February 10, 2021.

Now We're Starting Over Again

"Now We're Starting Over Again" is the title of a romantic ballad composed by Michael Masser and lyricist Gerry Goffin first recorded by Dionne Warwick in 1981 as "Now We're Starting Over Again". The song was most successful as a 1989 single release by Natalie Cole.
Dionne Warwick version.
"Now We're Starting Over Again" was one of five studio recordings by Dionne Warwick to augment the concert tracks on her 1981 album "Hot! Live and Otherwise": three of these studio tracks were produced and co-written by Michael Masser being - besides "Now We're Starting Over Again" - "There's a Long Road Ahead of Us" (also co-written with Gerry Goffin) and "Some Changes Are For Good" (co-written with Carole Bayer Sager), with the latter two tracks being chosen for single release in the U.S. Also, "Now We're Starting Over Again" was afforded a single release in some countries though without becoming a major hit, with its only evident chart showing being in the UK where it peaked at #76.
Natalie Cole cover.
Natalie Cole's version of "Starting Over Again" was released in late 1989 in the UK and early 1990 in the U.S., being the fifth of five singles released from her 1989 album "Good to Be Back", the first of which: "Miss You Like Crazy" (#7 on the "Billboard" Hot 100/ #1 R&amp;B) having been - like "Starting Over Again" - a Michael Masser production and co-write, "Miss You Like Crazy" being Cole's second major hit produced by Masser and written by Masser and Gerry Goffin, the first being "Someone That I Used to Love" (#21 on the "Billboard" Hot 100/ #21 R&amp;B) (1980). "Starting Over Again" did not afford Cole a Hot 100 or R&amp;B hit but did chart on "Billboard" magazine's Adult Contemporary chart at number five, also reaching 12 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart. "Starting Over Again" was also a minor hit in the UK (#56). The B-side of the single was Cole's duet with Freddie Jackson entitled "I Do" which in a previous release had been a Top Ten R&amp;B chart hit.

Leading name

A leading name (German "Leitname", plural "Leitnamen") is a given name that is used repeatedly over several generations in a lineage or broader kin group. Usually the entire name is used again and again, but sometimes a root of a name may be reused in several different forms.
A leading name could function as a sort of "moral property", where only those of the lineage had a right to use it and it was expected that nobody else would do so. Both the Merovingian and Carolingian dynasties of Frankish kings drew from a repertoire of names that were rarely or never used by other families.
Names could be passed on from the paternal or maternal side, often depending on which ancestors were more prominent.
The idea of tracing lineages and proposing genealogies based on analysis of leading names is old. In 1043, when Abbot Poppo of Stavelot opposed the marriage of the Emperor Henry III to Agnes of Poitou on grounds of consanguinity, he traced the ancestry of Henry's mother: "the descent of the genealogy is achieved through Mathildas and Gerbergas, in such a way that Mathilda, the daughter of Gerberga (with the same name as her grandmother) called her daughter by her mother's name, and she left her own name as an inheritance to her granddaughter."

Alexis Gravel

Alexis "Alex" Gravel (born March 21, 2000) is a Canadian major junior ice hockey goaltender who currently plays for the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL). Gravel was selected in the sixth round, 162nd overall, by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.
Playing career.
Before being drafted into major junior hockey, Gravel played two seasons for the Missasauga Senators of the Greater Toronto Hockey League and was selected 20th overall in the second round of the 2016 QMJHL Entry Draft by the Halifax Mooseheads.
Gravel began playing for the Mooseheads the following season, the 2016–17 season. In his first season with the team he played 50 games with 17 wins, 24 losses, and 3 overtime losses. Gravel had one shutout and had a (.894) save percentage and played 6 games in the playoffs for Halifax, the team was eliminated in the first round in 6 games by the Rouyn-Noranda Huskies. Gravel was a nominee for the Raymond Lagacé Trophy, which is the award given annually to the QMJHL's best defensive rookie of the year.
In his second season with the Mooseheads, Gravel found himself starting in fewer games and with a declining save percentage. He later admitted he was no longer enjoying the game, saying, "Mentally, I just wasn’t there. I think that screwed me a little bit." Gravel was selected 162nd overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.
A summer of enhanced workouts, together with hands-on training with Blackhawks developmental goalie coach Peter Aubrey, helped to refocus Gravel's attention for the 2018–19 QMJHL season. Starting in 49 games for the Mooseheads, he finished the regular season with 33 wins and a .913 save percentage, leading the team to first place in the league's Eastern Conference. In the QMJHL President Cup playoffs, Gravel backstopped the Mooseheads to its best finish in seven seasons, winning 14 of 23 games en route to a 4–2 series loss to the Rouyn-Noranda in the league final.
The two teams would meet again in the final of the 2019 Memorial Cup, the national championship of the Canadian Hockey League, by virtue of the Halifax's status as tournament host. While the Mooseheads would drop a 4–2 decision to the Huskies in the championship game, Gravel was awarded the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy as the tournament's best goalie, with a save percentage of .918 and a goals-against average of 2.78. Gravel was also named to the tournament all-star team.
International play.
Gravel was born in Germany but represents Canada in international competition. He was a goalie for Canada at the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics where he played in 4 games for Canada, earning a (.902) save percentage. Gravel also competed for Canada men's national under-18 ice hockey team and was named to the 2017 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, a tournament not sanctioned by the International Ice Hockey Federation, winning gold with Canada, and defeating the Czech Republic 4–1. Gravel played only one game for Canada in the tournament, earning a (3.69) goals against average with a (.857) save percentage.
Personal life.
Gravel was born in Berlin, Germany but grew up in Asbestos, Quebec. He is the son of Francois Gravel, a former professional ice hockey goaltender who was selected in the 3rd round, 87th overall in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft by the Montreal Canadiens and also represented France in the 1998 Winter Olympics. Gravel was inspired to play goaltender because of his father, and began playing when he was around five years old, first playing in Italy where his father played for 12 years.

Westchester Lagoon

The Westchester Lagoon is a combination of two artificial lakes which form a coastal lagoon near Downtown Anchorage, Alaska. On the lagoons western end, a raised, earthen levee offers right of way for the Alaska Railroad. The levee separates the lagoon from Cook Inlet's Knik Arm, although a large culvert allows spawning salmon swimming upstream from Cook Inlet to use the Chester Creek outflow they will find there. The Tony Knowles Coastal Trail system passes this end of the lagoon, before turning east and passing the Bootleggers Cove neighborhood to the north of the lagoon and continuing further inland into Anchorage. The lagoons eastern boundary is Spenard Road. To the south are single and multi-family homes, Hillcrest Drive and West Anchorage High School. The lagoon is bisected by Minnesota Drive, forming two distinct lakes. 
The lagoon, as well as its man-made islands and parks make up the Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park. Since 1975, the Municipality of Anchorage has designated the park a waterfowl sanctuary.
History.
In the early 1960s, the Municipality of Anchorage began implementing plans to protect the Chester Creek watershed, a system of creeks that carry rain and melt-water from the slopes of the nearby Chugach Mountains, incorporating the area into an urban renewal plan for the city in 1963. The railroad levee was built in 1968, and the city subsequently expanded the area by buying property along the areas perimeter in 1974. In 1975, the area was designated a bird sanctuary, and three man-made islands were completed. Also in 1975, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game and the Audubon Society planted native grasses in the area. In 1976, the city began forming plans to restore the natural habitat of the area, which was completed in 1977. In 1978, the lagoon was drained to allow crews to remove one of the three islands. Vandals targeted the lagoon in 1979, opening locks on the levee, and draining the lagoon. The city responded by installing a more secure system.
On September 30, 1993, the lagoon and surrounding parkland were rededicated as the Margaret Eagan Sullivan Park, named after the late wife of former Anchorage Mayor George M. Sullivan. 
Recreational use.
In addition to its function as a bird sanctuary and part of the local trail system, Westchester Lagoon is a popular recreation area. During the winter months, when the lagoon is frozen over, it is used as an ice skating rink, which is groomed and maintained by the city. A disc golf course runs through the lagoon area, and a snack bar operates during the summer months.

Philomène Belliveau

Philomène Belliveau (1854 – 1940) was a Canadian artist of Acadian descent.
The daughter of Modeste Cormier and Joseph Belliveau, she was born in Memramcook and was educated at the convent of the Sisters of Sacré Cœur (known as Reed's Castle) in Saint John. In 1889, she travelled to Boston, where she took courses in painting and drawing. After she returned to New Brunswick, her portraits in pastel became very popular. The Acadian museum at the Université de Moncton has four of these portraits in their collection.
In 1904, she married judge Alphonse Pierre Garon. The couple settled in Shediac, later moving to Rimouski.
She died in Rimouski, Quebec, Canada at the age of 85.

1989 Florida's 18th congressional district special election

A special election to determine the member of the United States House of Representatives for Florida's 18th congressional district was held on August 29, 1989. Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen defeated Democrat Gerald Richman in the runoff vote, 53.14% to 46.85%. Ros-Lehtinen replaced Claude Pepper, who died in office from stomach cancer.
Changing demographics in Florida's 18th congressional district had moved the largely white district into a 40% Cuban American district. The election campaign followed this trend as the campaign was dominated by discussions of race after Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater declared that the district should become the "Cuban American seat". Democrat Gerald Richman ran a campaign with the slogan "This is an American seat" in response to Atwater's comments, and both Ros-Lehtinen and Richman appealed to their respective racial bases in the general. Ros-Lehtinen won a competitive campaign to flip the seat, and became the first Cuban American to serve in Congress.
Background.
United States Congressman Claude Pepper died in office from stomach cancer on May 30, 1989 after serving in the House for over a quarter century, opening up a special election to fill his seat. Pepper had previously served as a U.S. Senator from Florida as well and was seen as a lion of the U.S. Congress. Pepper's reputation and length of service had insulated him from the racial splits that existed in his district, and "The New York Times" noted that he had been able to bridge the gap inside of the district. The district had moved from a largely white district into a 40% Cuban American district. Florida Governor Bob Martinez announced the special election schedule the day after Pepper's burial.
Republican primary.
Summary.
Early coverage on the Republican primary named State Senator Ileana Ros-Lehtinen as the favorite to win the Republican nomination. Jeb Bush managed Ros-Lehtinen's campaign. After Pepper's death, Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater declared that the seat should become a "Cuban American seat" and immediately caused controversy with the comment. Challengers other than Ros-Lehtinen included: Carlos Perez, a business owner who had been highlighted in Ronald Reagan's State of the Union address; David Fleischer, an insurance broker who decided to run after Atwater's comments; and John Stembridge, a furniture store owner who claimed that Pepper "was like an adopted father to me and I felt like he was personally grooming me to take his place".
Ileana Ros-Lehtinen won the primary with more than 80% of the vote, winning every precinct and avoiding a runoff. "We're quite humbled and really flabbergasted," Ros-Lehtinen said at her surprise of winning the primary by such a wide margin.
Democratic primary.
Summary.
The Democratic primary was much more chaotic than the Republican one. After Lee Atwater announced that the district should become a "Cuban American seat", early Democratic favorite Jack Gordon dropped out after two days, stating that he refused to run a campaign that would have to be about "stopping the Cubans". Rosario Kennedy, a Miami City Commissioner, was handicapped as the initial favorite. In a first-round upset, Gerald Richman, the former President of the Florida Bar, beat Kennedy by 146 votes. Both advanced to the runoff.
The runoff campaign was dominated by controversial discussions of race. Richman repeatedly said, "This is an American seat" in reaction to Atwater's comments. Jo Ann Pepper, Marvin Dunn, and Sonny Wright, who split the African American neighborhoods in the district, all endorsed Kennedy. "The Miami Herald" endorsed Kennedy and called Richman's campaign "naked, deliberate, bigotry". Richman easily won the runoff over Kennedy, dominating in white and Jewish neighborhoods. The results split starkly among racial lines and after Richman's win, Kennedy refused to endorse him.
General election.
The racial themes from both primaries continued throughout the general election. Richman's campaign came under continued fire for his "This is an American seat" slogan, while Ros-Lehtinen's campaign was criticized for a Spanish language brochure which emphasized Richman's Jewish religion. Richman spent more than $300,000 of his own money on his campaign. Ros-Lehtinen called Richman and his campaign bigoted and refused to appear at any debates or events with him. A poll by "The Miami Herald" found that 28 out of every 29 Cuban American voters supported Ros-Lehtinen while 24 of every 25 Jewish voters supported Richman, regardless of normal political ideology and leanings. National Republicans came to support Ros-Lehtinen, including President George H. W. Bush who hosted a fundraiser for her campaign and appeared jointly with her.
Ros-Lehtinen won the seat with a six point margin, 53 to 47 percent. Voter turnout matched strongly with ethnic lines. According to exit polling, approximately 60 percent of the district's Hispanic voters turned out, while only 40 percent of the Anglos and 34 percent of the African Americans. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen became the first Latina and the first Cuban American to serve in Congress after this victory. After the election, the Anti-Defamation League called for a "healing process" for the communities of the district and described the election as a "dark moment". Both campaigns were censured by the Fair Campaigns Practices Committee, a watchdog group, for the racially tinged campaigns they ran.

Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo

"Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo" (,  "Lovely, brothers, lovely") is a traditional Cossack song known in Russian and Ukrainian languages. Its name derived from the first row of the refrain: "Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo, lyubo, bratsy, zhit" (, ), that means "it is lovely to live, brothers". The song was first recorded by Ukrainian folklorists in the South of Kherson Oblast and was popular with Nestor Makhno's troops in Ukraine in the beginning of 1920s. It also became very popular in the Soviet Union during wartime after the release of the Soviet film "Alexander Parkhomenko" (1942) where it was performed in Russian by Boris Chirkov.
Synopsis.
The Cossacks (in some versions: Tatars, etc.) led 40,000 horses to the Terek River. After the bloody battle, one bank of the Terek is covered by the dead men and animals. The fatally wounded hero remembers about his wife, his mother, and his steed. Feeling sorrow for the two latter, he mourns his fate.
Historical background.
The phrase "Lyubo, bratsy, zhit'" () appeared in a soldier song published in "Biblioteka Dlya Chteniya", 1837.
According to several authors, the song is dedicated to the events of the Russian Civil War (1917 – 1922). Other sources mention it as a piece of Cossack folklore. The song was recorded in Ukrainian by folklorists in the South of Kherson Oblast and was popular with Nestor Makhno's troops in Ukraine in the beginning of 1920s.
The song became extremely popular after the release of the Soviet film "Alexander Parkhomenko" (1942) where it was performed by Boris Chirkov. In 1942 – 1943, a tankers adaptation was created, based on the Chirkov's version.

The song was popularized by such well-known Russian and Soviet artists as the Kuban Cossack Choir, Zhanna Bichevskaya, Pelageya, etc.

Hino da Maria da Fonte

The ""Maria da Fonte" anthem" (), also known as the "Anthem of Minho" () is a Portuguese patriotic anthem, written in 1846 by Angelo Frondoni with lyrics by Paulo Midosi, following the popularly-called Revolution of Maria da Fonte.
History.
According to Angelo Frondoni's obituary, written by Acácio Antunes and published on the "O Occidente" magazine in 1891, the idea for this patriotic anthem came from Paulo Midosi, who was Frondoni's librettist in several operettas. Midosi came to Frondoni so he would compose a song to go with a couple of verses of his own making for "an enthusiastic anthem". The music, that Fondoni wrote in its entirety on the same day, would become the song of the popular revolt in the spring of 1846, against the government of the Count of Tomar.
According to João Augusto Marques Gomes, the "Maria da Fonte" anthem was sung for the first time on 24 June 1846, a month after the main incidents of the revolt, in the house of the Marquess of Nisa, by an opera singer. The triumph of the liberal faction, assures the return of César de Vasconcelos, José Estêvão, e Mendes Leite, who had been in exile following the Torres Novas "pronunciamento". On 6 July, the three attend Almeida Garrett's play "O Alfageme de Santarém" in D. Maria II National Theatre — during intermission, a band played the "Maria da Fonte" anthem, and the audience enthusiastically sung, clapped and cheered on.
The "Maria da Fonte" anthem is still used today in formal military and civic ceremonies in Portugal. It serves as honors music to the legislative speaker, the Prime Minister and the cabinet, as well as to the President of the Supreme Court of Justice, the Chief and Vice-Chief of the Armed Forces General Staff, and the military heads of the Navy, of the Army, and of the Air Force.
Lyrics.
While there are multiple historical variations in the lyrics of the song, that tended to be changed according to the political climate of the time, the original lyrics written by Paulo Midosi in 1846 are the following:
&lt;poem&gt;
Baqueou a tirania
Nobre povo, és vencedor,
Generoso, ousado e livre,
Dêmos glória ao teu valor.
Eia avante, Portugueses!
Eia avante, não temer!
Pela santa Liberdade,
Triunfar ou perecer!
Algemada era a Nação,
Mas é livre ainda uma vez;
Ora, e sempre, é caro à Pátria
O heroísmo Português.
Eia avante, Portugueses...
Lá raiou a Liberdade
Que a Nação há-de aditar!
Glória ao Minho que primeiro
O seu grito fez soar!
Eia avante, Portugueses...
Segue, ó Povo, o belo exemplo
De tamanha heroicidade:
Nunca mais deixes tiranos
Ameaçar a Liberdade.
Eia avante, Portugueses...
Fugi déspotas! Fugi,
Vis algozes da Nação!
Livre, a Pátria vos repulsa,
Terminou a escravidão!
Eia avante, Portugueses...
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Tyranny has succumbed
Noble people, you are the victor
Generous, bold, and free
Glory be upon your worth.
Onward, Portuguese!
Onward, never fear!
For blessed Freedom,
Either triumph or perish!
The Nation was in shackles
But it's free again once more;
Now and always the Fatherland is dear
To the Portuguese prowess.
Onward, Portuguese...
The dawn of Freedom is upon us
Filling with Nation with bliss
Glory be upon Minho, the first
Who made their cries heard!
Onward, Portuguese...
Follow, People, the example
Of such heroism:
Never again let tyrants
Threatern our Freedom.
Onward, Portuguese...
Flee, despots! Flee,
Vile butchers of the Nation!
Free, the Fatherland banishes you,
Slavery is no more!
Onward, Portuguese...
&lt;/poem&gt;

Currant Creek (Juab and Utah counties, Utah)

Currant Creek is a stream in eastern Juab County and southern Utah County in northern Utah, United States.
Description.
The creek rises on the south end of a spring-fed marsh area in the northern part of Juab Valley, in eastern Juab County, about south‑southeast of the Burriston Ponds, west of Interstate 15, and about north‑northwest of the center of the city of Nephi, with an approximate elevation of . From its source the creek runs north‑northwest though the marsh area. Within the marsh area, the creek flows through several unnamed ponds and joins with several other unnamed streams (with headwaters that are just east and west of the source of Currant Creek). Continuing north, it flows just west of and is fed by the Burriston Ponds. Just west of the ponds is Currant Creek's confluence with West Creek. Still further north it passes west of the city of Mona and, just before entering the Mona Reservoir (also known as Mount Nebo Reservoir), passes under Goshen Canyon Road (formerly State Route 214 (1941-1953).
On the northwest side of the Mona Reservoir (which is also fed by several unnamed streams) the creek passes through the dam (with a spillway elevation of ) and then continues northwest through the Goshen Canyon. A short way down the canyon, the creek passes back under Goshen Canyon Road. Midway through the canyon the creek leaves Juab County and enters Utah County. The creek then continues flowing northwest from the canyon through the Goshen Valley until it reaches its confluence with Kimball Creek and then enters the Goshen Reservoir. Immediately north of the reservoir, the creek passes under U.S. Route 6. It then continues north from that highway until it reaches its mouth in a marsh area on the north side of the Goshen Valley at its confluence with the Goshen Bay of Utah Lake, at an elevation of .
Tributaries.
In addition to numerous unnamed springs and streams that contribute to Currant Creek, there are two named tributaries.
West Creek.
West Creek, the first named tributary of Currant Creek, is a stream located in eastern Juab County. The source of the creek is the Orme Spring, located in the middle of the West Hills range at the top of Spring Canyon at an elevation of about . From the spring, the creek flows north‑northeast down to an elevation of at the mouth of the canyon. After entering the Juab Valley, the creek continues its northerly course along the west side of the valley to pass under State Route 132. It then resumes a north‑northeast course until it empties into the Currant Creek, immediately west of the Burriston Ponds, at an elevation of .
Orme Spring.
Orme Spring, is spring in eastern Juab County. The seepage spring is located near the head of Spring Canyon in the West Hills, at an elevation of about , and is the source of West Creek.
Kimball Creek.
Kimball Creek, the other named tributary of Currant Creek, is an intermittent stream and is located in southern Utah County. The creek rises on the east face of the south side of Tintic Mountain at the top of Big Dog Canyon within the East Tintic Mountains range, at an elevation of approximately and just east of the Juab‑Utah county line. From is source, the creek and the canyon run southerly to a point about south‑southeast of the source and about north of the Juab‑Utah county line. The creek and the canyon then head northeast to the mouth of the canyon on the southwest end of the Goshen Valley. After entering the valley, the creek continues on its northeasterly course until it reaches its mouth on the Current Creek, about south of the Goshen Reservoir, at an elevation of .

1986 UK Athletics Championships

The 1986 UK Athletics Championships was the national championship in outdoor track and field for the United Kingdom held at Cwmbran Stadium, Cwmbran. It was the fourth time the event was held in the Welsh town. The women's 5000 metres was dropped from the programme and replaced by a women's 10,000 metres event.
It was the tenth edition of the competition limited to British athletes only, launched as an alternative to the AAA Championships, which was open to foreign competitors. However, due to the fact that the calibre of national competition remained greater at the AAA event, the UK Championships this year were not considered the principal national championship event by some statisticians, such as the National Union of Track Statisticians (NUTS). Many of the athletes below also competed at the 1986 AAA Championships.
Fatima Whitbread won her sixth consecutive women's javelin throw UK title, while shot putters Billy Cole and Judy Oakes both won a third straight title. Amongst the men's 1985 champions, John Regis (200 m), Phil Brown (400 m), Kevin Capper (steeplechase), Geoff Parsons (high jump), Andy Ashurst (pole vault) and Mick Hill (javelin) successfully defended their titles. Kathy Cook was the only woman other than Whitbread and Oakes to have a repeat win. Sprinter Sandra Whittaker was the only person to reach the podium in two events.
The main international track and field competition for the United Kingdom that year was the 1986 European Athletics Championships. UK champions Fatima Whitbread and Jack Buckner (5000 m) went on to become European champions, while Yvonne Murray (UK runner-up) took a 3000 m bronze. The four countries of the United Kingdom competed separately at the Commonwealth Games that year as well. UK Championships athletes to become Commonwealth gold medalists there included Roger Black (400 m), John Herbert (triple jump), Liz Lynch (10,000 m), Sally Gunnell (100 m hurdles), Joyce Oladapo (long jump), Andy Ashurst (pole vault) and Billy Cole (shot put).

Susan Archer Weiss

Susan Archer Weiss (February 14, 1822 – April 7, 1917) was an American poet, author and artist. Losing her hearing as a child, she rarely mingled in society beyond a select circle of friends, finding her happiness in her home. Her life was essentially that of a poet, though she also painted. In September 1859, a collection of her poems was issued by Rudd &amp; Carlton, of New York City. Her name was included among those of young writers in "American Female Poets", Sarah Josepha Hale's "Woman's Record", and other similar works. Weiss was a friend of Edgar Allan Poe.
Early years and education.
Susan Archer Talley was born in Hanover County, Virginia, February 14, 1822, on the plantation of her paternal grandfather. She was descended from a French Huguenot who, escaping the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, fled to the United States, and settled in Virginia. This grandfather served in Lee's Legion of the American Revolutionary War. Her father studied law under Judge Robert Taylor of Norfolk, Virginia. Her mother was a daughter of Captain Archer, of one of the oldest and most distinguished families of Norfolk.
Weiss passed her first eight years on the plantation, after which, the family moved to Richmond, Virginia, when on account of ill health, her father had resigned the practice of his profession, and retired. It was in Richmond that she entered school. Though of an exceedingly happy temperament, Weiss rarely mingled with other children, but would spend most of her time in reading, study, or in wandering amid the woods and meadows that surrounded her father's residence.
At nine years of age, she suddenly and entirely lost her hearing due to scarlet fever, making it necessary to remove her from school. She had been quick at learning, and in the brief period of her school life, had advanced rapidly, so that the slight knowledge thus acquired served as a foundation for her future self-education. When she was ten years old, she developed a talent for drawing, which her father took pains to cultivate. Her crayon drawings, many of them original in design, and especially her miniature portraits, were remarkable for their execution and finish. She exhibited equal skill in watercolors and oil painting.
At the age of eleven, by accident, some of her verses were read by her father. He showed them to Benjamin Blake Minor, editor of the "Southern Literary Messenger", who published them in his magazine, where, in a few years, her contributions attracted much attention.
It may be said that from the time when she left school till she was sixteen, her life was passed in the solitude of her home, where she seemed to derive from books a constant and ever-increasing enjoyment. It was not until she was in her fifteenth year that the nature and force of her talents were noticed by her most intimate associates. She became interested in the work of her cousin, the sculptor, Alexander Gait (1827- 1863), and spent many hours in his studio. One day he gave her a small block of plaster, out of which, without assistance or model, she cut with a pen-knife a female head so plainly the work of genius that Gait took it with him to Italy, where it was seen by Thomas Crawford and Horatio Greenough, who were enthusiastic in their desire that she should devote herself to sculpture, but her father's death hindered her from doing so.
Career.
After Weiss' family removed from Richmond to a suburban residence, she became absorbed in her pictures and her writing and in the society of a choice circle of friends, where she led a happy life. In 1859, she had a volume of her poems printed in a small edition and distributed among editors and critics, by whom it was received with flattering notice, but the commencement of the Civil War, interfering with literary enterprises, prevented the publishing of a second edition in those years. During the war, she was deprived of her home, which had been converted into a fortification for the defense of the city. She thus became, for some time, a resident between the two opposing armies. During the Civil War, she was accused by the National authorities of being a spy, and was arrested and imprisoned at Fort McHenry, Baltimore. While there, in 1863, she married Col. von Weiss (d. 1869), a German officer, of the Union army, with whom she, for some years, resided in New York City. The marriage proved an unhappy one, and she was compelled to sue for divorce and possession of their only child. As she declined to accept alimony, and had been by the war deprived of nearly all her property, she decided to support herself and child by writing prose and stories. She contributed to New York City newspapers, to "Harper's", "Scribner's", and other magazines, until she developed a painful affliction of the eyes, which for some years incapacitated her from writing.
In later years, she resided with her son, in Richmond, Virginia. Weiss died April 7, 1917.
Style.
What is most noticeable in Weiss' poems is their rhythmical harmony. The only instance in literary history in which so melodious a versification was attained under similar circumstances was that of James M. Nack, the deaf poet of New York, whose writings were published several years earlier by Prosper Montgomery Wetmore. There was not in Nack's poems, however, any single composition that could be compared with "Ennerslie", in grace, or variety of cadences. It was said that this poem, without being an imitation, would remind the reader of one of the finest productions of Alfred, Lord Tennyson.

Thomas William Marshall (painter)

Thomas William Marshall was an English post-impressionist painter and water colorist, born on at Donisthorpe in England. He passed away on in Paris.
He painted landscapes, portraits, nudes and produced watercolours, in Paris, in Île-de-France, in Normandy, on the French Riviera and in Corsica. Between 1904 and 1914, He exhibited his work in Paris at the Salon d'Automne, as well as the Salon des Indépendants and also at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts. These art salons were at the peak of their glory, in this era, with well known painters such as Marquet, Modigliani, Sickert, Kandinsky, participating in them.
Biography.
Thomas William Marshall was born in 1875 in Donisthorpe, Derbyshire in England. He was the son of Robert Aldred Marshall (1852-1884) a wealthy mining engineer from Nottinghamshire who died in the Bullhouse Bridge rail accident, and Dorothy Ann Tarr (1852–1879). He is a first cousin of the rugby player Frank Tarr. Thomas William studied in both Oxford and in Cambridge.
Wishing to become a painter despite his fragile health, he left England to live in Paris in 1897 and enrolled in the Académie Julian. There he met the Canadian painter Albert Henry Robinson, who would become his student and friend. In Paris he was reunited with his English friends, also painters, such as Ernest Yarrow Jones (1872–1951). As of 1900, he began to participate successfully in some Parisian exhibitions. His studio was located at 3 rue Campagne-Première, he then moved to 51 rue de Sèvres, and then relocated to 49 boulevard du Montparnasse.
In 1904, he participated for the first time in the Salon d'Automne where he would show an average of five to six paintings or watercolours per salon, every year until 1913. He was named as a member of the Salon in 1908. During this time, he showed works at the Salon des Indépendants in 1906 and then from 1908 to 1914. He also showed his works at the Nationale des Beaux-Arts in 1911 and at the London Salon (of the Allied Artists Association) in London from 1908 to 1914. Thomas William Marshall was one of the founding members of the London Salon with Walter Sickert.
Thomas William Marshall was a member of the Golf Club of Paris (Société de golf de Paris) and played at the when he started. Therefore, he produced many drawings and caricatures inspired by this sport.
Due to his fragile health, he left for the Côte d'Azur and settled in Corse in 1908, where he produced a large part of his body of work (oil on canvas or on cardboard, watercolours and caricatures). He transferred works he had created in Corsica onto canvas:landscapes and scenes inspired by daily life on the island back to Paris for exhibition. These works gained him much praise from the art critics of that era.
In 1910, Thomas William Marshall married Marie-Louise Désagullier who had been his companion and model for many years. He died prematurely from tuberculosis on in Paris, at the age of 38, at the height of his talent. He was cremated at cimetière du Père-Lachaise and his ashes are resting at the columbarium (87th division, niche n° 2137).
Wealthier than many of the contemporary artists of his time, he did not really need to sell much of his art to live; as a result, he remained relatively unknown until his rediscovery by art critic in 1984. One of Thomas William Marshall's paintings, a landscape of Corsica painted in 1910, was selected by a specialized jury and art lovers, displayed at the Espace Pierre Cardin at the Champs-Élysées and was reproduced in colour in an edition of the magazine Paris-Match in December 1984.
Many exhibitions to honour his work followed: at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris in 1986, at the Salon d'Automne in 1987 where an entire room was dedicated in tribute to him, and two personal exhibitions in Bastia in 1988 and in Villefranche-sur-mer in 1993. The Beauvais museum acquired a painting in 1987. Bastia and Villefranche-sur-Mer museums each have conserved one or more of his works in their public collections.
Works.
Recognized by Jacques Foucart, general curator at the Paintings Department of the Musée du Louvre, the pictorial work of the English painter Thomas William Marshall, is both inspired by the last sparkling embers of the 19th century and by the end of Impressionism. Composed of numerous oil paintings and watercolours, of rare quality, his work can be added to the post-impressionist and symboliste movements. Also certain pieces could be considered neo-Japonard or nabis. Regardless of how one classifies it, his work remains deeply original.

Career.
Robertson began her LGBT activist career as a co-founder of the Hamilton McMaster Gay Liberation Movement in 1970. While attending the University of Waterloo in 1974, she was discriminated against by a landlord on the basis of her sexual orientation.

After leaving the AIDS Committee, Robertson became a private practice counsellor. When she returned to Ottawa in 2004, Robertson co-founded the Lesbian Information Xchange in 2005 and the Ottawa Senior Pride Network in 2008.
Awards and honors.
In 1994, Robertson was given the Canadian Lambda Award for Excellence in Human Rights and a portrait of her was inducted into the National Portrait Collection of The ArQuives: Canada's LGBTQ2+ Archives in 2002. In 2013, she was inducted into the Q Hall of Fame Canada.

Robert Southern

Sir Robert Southern (17 March 1907 – September 1999) was a British co-operative official.
Born in Prestwich, Southern was educated at Stand Grammar School. He was interested in the co-operative movement from an early age, joining the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) in 1923. He studied at the Co-operative College, and from 1929 worked for the Co-operative Union. In his spare time, he completed a degree in commerce with the University of Manchester.
In 1946, Southern was appointed as assistant general secretary of the Co-operative Union, and he was promoted to general secretary in 1950. He remained in this post until his retirement, in 1972, also serving as a vice-president of the International Co-operative Alliance and as president of the 1969 Co-operative Congress.
Southern devoted much of his spare time to the Stand Unitarian Chapel, serving as secretary of its trustees, and as superintendent of its Sunday school. He was also secretary of the Besses o' th' Barn Band Company, a brass band, and was active in the Radcliffe Literary Society and Camera Club. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1953, and was knighted in the 1970 New Year Honours.

The Old Laughing Lady

"The Old Laughing Lady" is a song written by Neil Young that was first released on his 1968 debut solo album "Neil Young".
Music and lyrics.
Allmusic critic Matthew Greenwald describes "The Old Laughing Lady" as a "striking mood piece." He describes the music as being "built on some simple, downcast chord changes, in a modal D guitar tuning," which he says gives the song depth and grandeur. Music critic Johnny Rogan describes the song's use of string instruments and a "ghostly girl chorus" as giving it an "eerie effect." 
Young biographer Jimmy McDonough remarks on the song's "sweet, sad countermelodies passing from strings to French horn with beautiful restraint." According to music critic Nigel Williamson, the production by Jack Nitzsche helps give the song a sense of mystery. The song contains four verses but no refrain. The changes in mood and tone over the course of the song are reminiscent of Young's earlier song "Broken Arrow" that he wrote and performed as a member of Buffalo Springfield. 
"Rolling Stone Magazine" critic Gary Von Tersch considers "The Old Laughing Lady" to be the more effective of the two, because he considers it to be "tighter, more mature and [have] more of the quiet explosion to it that Young obviously intends.
The themes of "The Old Laughing Lady" include love, death, alcoholism and alienation. The old laughing lady of the title can be a metaphor for either death or alcohol. The song describes how the old laughing lady affects the lives of those she interacts with.
Writing and recording.
"The Old Laughing Lady" was written earlier than most of the songs on "Neil Young". According to Young, he wrote it one day on a napkin while drinking coffee in a coffee shop without knowing what prompted it. A version was recorded by Buffalo Springfield for their 1968 album "Last Time Around" in January 1968. 
An even earlier version was tried out during the sessions for Buffalo Springfield's earlier album "Buffalo Springfield Again". In the version on "Neil Young", Nitzsche used a vocal muting technique that makes Young sound "a million miles away, but right there."
Reception.
"Neil Young FAQ" author Glen Boyd described "The Old Laughing Lady" as having "stood the test of time" since "Neil Young" was released. "Pitchfork" contributor Mark Richardson describes the song as having "echoes of the great music to come" from Young's later career. In 2014 the editors of "Rolling Stone Magazine" ranked it as Young's 63rd all time greatest song , describing it as "California psychedelia with the sun sucked out."
Young included "The Old Laughing Lady" on his 1977 compilation album "Decade". A live version was released on Young's 1993 album "Unplugged", although Rogan felt that version lacked the mystery and sadness of the original.

FIA Formula 3 Championship

The FIA Formula 3 Championship is a third-tier international single-seater racing championship and organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). The championship launched in 2019 as a feeder series for the FIA Formula 1 World Championship and FIA Formula 2 Championships. It was the result of a merger between two third-tier single-seater racing championships, the GP3 Series and the FIA Formula 3 European Championship as it was announced on 10 March 2018. The championship is part of the FIA Global Pathway consolidation project plan. Unlike its predecessor, the Formula 3 European Championship, the series runs exclusively in support of Formula One races.
Origins and history.
On 13 March 2017 it was announced that the GP3 Series would merge with the FIA and DMSB's FIA Formula 3 European Championship and as such, both bodies would merge their both third-tier open-wheel single seater formula racing series, the GP3 Series and FIA Formula 3 European Championship respectively, with plans to début in 2019. On 1 September 2017 the merger committee announced that World Motor Sport Council were selected to develop the name, logo and identity of the new series. The reveal date for the new series was 10 March 2018 at the FIA headquarters at Paris, France. GP3 Series CEO Bruno Michel announced the new sanctioning body would be sanctioned by FIA from 2019 season and thus become Formula One's sole support Grand Prix weekends mostly in Europe. FIA President Jean Todt then announced the new FIA Formula 3 Championship title and logo later in October 2018.
Race weekend.
Pit stops are optional if there is a force majeure event like a change in weather conditions, tyre puncture, front or rear wing damage or others.
On Friday, drivers have a 45-minute free practice session and a 30-minute qualifying session.
On Saturday there will be two Races due the cost cutting measures set out by the FIA and Formula 3 alongside Formula 2. Race 1 will be run over 40 minutes. The grid order for this race is decided by reversing the top 12 from Friday's qualifying session. For race 2 the top 12 of the final classification of race 1 will be reversed, with the driver who finishes in 12th on pole and the driver who won the race starting from 12th.
Sunday's race (Race 3) is run over 40 minutes . The grid is decided by using the order of the original qualification standings from Friday
Timetables will be issued ahead of every round as per usual.
Points system.
The top 10 finishers in races 1 &amp; 2 receive points as follows:
The fastest lap in the sprint race also receives 2 points as in the feature race.
Feature races have a scoring system similar to the one used in Formula One, shown below:
The driver who qualified in pole position for the feature race receives an additional 4 points.
The fastest lap is awarded 2 points. In order to qualify for fastest lap points the driver must have completed 90% of the total race laps and must finish in the top 10.
The maximum number of points a driver can score at any round will be 65.
A count-back system is used to decide places of drivers with equal points in the championship with the driver with most wins ranking highest of those with equal points totals. If there is still a tie, the most second-place finishes, then the most third-place finishes, etc., is used to split the tied drivers. This count-back system is applied at all stages of the championship.
Racing flags.
These are the racing flags that usually used in every FIA Formula 3 Championship race weekends:
Car.
The FIA Formula 3 Championship car is used by all of the teams, and features a Dallara carbon-fiber monocoque chassis powered by a Mecachrome naturally-aspirated direct-injected V6 engine and Pirelli dry slick and rain treaded tyres.
Chassis.
The F3 Championship will use the 2019 specification F3 2019 car which has been designed by Dallara Automobili. The new FIA Formula 3 Championship chassis material is Carbon/aluminium honeycomb structure and also Carbon Aramid honeycomb bodywork structure. The new FIA Formula 3 Championship car's front wings are slightly wider and also wider-lower rear wing.
Transmission, gearbox and clutches.
The current gearbox has been manufactured by Hewland and features an 8-position barrel with ratchet body and software upgrades as well as a new transverse shafts fixing system designed to facilitate improved gear selection. Currently, the FIA Formula 3 Championship gearbox uses a 6-speed sequential gearbox configuration with electro-hydraulic control via paddle-shifters, with reverse operated by a reverse button on the steering wheel. The clutches of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are supplied by AP Racing with the multi-plate clutch operated by a hand-paddle lever.
Wheel rims.
O.Z. Racing exclusively supplies wheel rims for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars.
Tyres.
Pirelli will continue supplying tyres for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars as they have done since the GP3 Series era. The tyre size of all cars will still remain the same as in the GP3 Series. The tyre sizes are 250/575-R13 on the fronts and 290/590-R13 on the rears. The compounds of Pirelli Formula 3 tyres are currently three dry compounds (red soft, yellow medium and white hard) carrying the "P Zero" brand and one wet compound (blue wet) carrying the "Cinturato" brand.
Brakes.
Brembo supplies monobloc brake calipers and disc bells, which are exclusive to the FIA Formula 3 Championship. Carbone Industrie also supplies carbon brake discs and pads for the championship.
Suspension.
The suspension of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars is upper and lower steel wishbones, pushrod operated, coupled with twin Koni dampers and torsion bars suspension (front) and spring suspension (rear) similar to current Formula One car suspension.
Steering wheel.
From the 2019 season, all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars will utilize the all-new XAP Single-seat Formula 2451 S3 steering wheel with a larger dash screen and also three new rotary switches (similar to the current FIA Formula E and FIA Formula 2 steering wheel).
Safety.
The current safety innovation of FIA Formula 3 Championship is the top priority. Front, side, rear and steering column impact tests are the FIA safety standards. All of the FIA Formula 3 Championship cars include front and rear roll hoop, impact structures and monocoque push tests. Anti-intrusion survival cell protection panels are also featured since 2019. Wheel retainer safety cables are also featured to avoid wheel flying similar to Formula One, IndyCar Series (known as SWEMS) and other single-seater Formula racing series. The seat belts of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are supplied by Sabelt with 6-point seat belt configuration similar to Formula One. From 2019 onwards, the “halo” cockpit protection system would be introduced to avoid the series of fatal crashes.
Other components.
All FIA Formula 3 cars carry a Magneti Marelli-provided electronic control unit as well as Magneti Marelli power supply management unit. Live telemetry is used only for television broadcasts, but the data can be recorded from the ECU to the computer if the car is in the garage and not on the track.
Rear view mirrors for all FIA Formula 3 cars are mandated for easy viewing of opponents behind.
Aerodynamics.
The aerodynamics of current FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are resembling the Formula One 2017-style aerodynamic with wider and curved front wing and also lower rear wing with parallelogram rear wing plate. Side winglets are also banned. The undertrays of all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars are grounds-effect underbody as opposed to flat-bottom underbody that usually utilized in Formula One.
Drag Reduction Systems (DRS).
Since 2017 GP3 Series season, the Drag Reduction Systems (DRS) were introduced in a purpose for overtaking maneuver assist by tilting the upper-element rear wing while approaching the opponent less than a second away by activating the DRS paddle behind the steering wheel. The upper-element rear wing angle of FIA Formula 3 car rear wing is the same angle as Formula One car which has over 40 degrees of angle. In an event of rainy conditions, Drag Reduction Systems are automatically deactivated for safety reasons.
Engine.
First generation (second-generation overall).
The series will remain using the 3.4-litre V6 naturally-aspirated direct-injected engines supplied by Mecachrome until at least the 2021 season due to FIA Formula 3 Championship not being interested in a turbocharged engine. The horsepower will be scaled down from .
Mecachrome V634 F3 V6 engines were crated and shipped to all FIA Formula 3 Championship teams on a serial-number basis as determined by the FIA to ensure equality and fairness in distribution.
Fuel and lubricants components.
All Formula 3 cars currently use ordinary unleaded racing gasoline as fuel (similar to commercial vehicle unleaded street gasoline), which has been the "de facto" standard in third tier single-seater formula racing since the introduction of GP3 Series in 2010. Current Elf LMS 102 RON unleaded gasoline resembles ordinary unleaded gasoline but produces better mileage while being environmental-friendly and safer than other fuels. Since 2019, Elf exclusively continues providing the LMS 102 RON unleaded fuel and also Elf HTX 840 0W-40 lubricants for all FIA Formula 3 Championship cars.
Other parts.
The car also features internal cooling upgrades, a new water radiator, radiator duct, oil/water heat exchanger, modified oil degasser, new oil and water pipes and new heat exchanger fixing brackets.
Seasons.
2019.
The inaugural season of the FIA Formula 3 Championship consisted of 16 races held across eight rounds at European circuits, beginning on 11 May at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya and ending on 29 September at the Sochi Autodrom. 2019 marked the debut of the new Dallara F3 2019 chassis, powered by a naturally-aspirated 3.4L V6 engine developed by Mecachrome, the same engine used in the car's GP3 Series predecessor the Dallara GP3/16. This also marked the debut of the halo safety device, bodywork that had been introduced in Formula 1 and Formula 2 in .
Prema Racing won the teams' championship, scoring over twice as many points as runners-up Hitech Grand Prix and extending their streak to seven consecutive teams' championships from the predecessor FIA Formula 3 European Championship. The three Prema Racing drivers finished in the top three positions in the drivers' championship. Robert Shwartzman finished the season as champion, having taken three race wins including the first race in Barcelona. Marcus Armstrong finished as runner-up with Jehan Daruvala in third.
2020.
The 2020 championship was due to begin at the Bahrain International Circuit on 21 March, with Circuit Paul Ricard being dropped from the calendar in favour of Circuit Zandvoort. However, the first three rounds of the championship were postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A revised calendar was published in June, consisting of 18 races across nine rounds held alongside the first nine races of the Formula One World Championship. The season began at the Red Bull Ring on 4 July and concluded at the Mugello Circuit on 13 September.
Prema Racing secured their eighth consecutive teams' championship at Monza with three races left to go. Prema driver Oscar Piastri ended the season as champion, securing the title at the final race. He finished three points ahead of ART Grand Prix driver Théo Pourchaire, with Prema's Logan Sargeant in third place.
2021.
As a cost-cutting measure, the 2021 championship calendar was reduced to seven rounds with each round consisting of three races, featuring twenty-one races in total, in line with changes made to the 2021 FIA Formula 2 Championship. The rounds at Silverstone Circuit, Autodromo Nazionale di Monza and Mugello Circuit were dropped from the calendar, and the rounds at Circuit Paul Ricard and Circuit Zandvoort returned, having been cancelled in 2020. The championship began on 8 May at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya. The season was initially intended to conclude on 24 October at the Circuit of the Americas, however this was cancelled and replaced with a round at the Sochi Autodrom, ending on 26 September.
The drivers' championship was won by Prema Racing's Dennis Hauger, who took four race victories and claimed the championship title with two races remaining. Trident drivers Jack Doohan and Clément Novalak finished second and third respectively. Trident ended Prema Racing's streak of teams' championship victories, claiming the title at the final race by a margin of four points.
Drivers graduated to FIA Formula 2 Championship.

Orientation selectivity

Orientation selectivity is expressed by cells within the visual cortex, when such cells increase impulse or signal activity for specific oriented degree of shape presented within the visual field. Orientation selectivity can also be expressed by simple cells if the orientation of a stimulus is orthogonal to the preferred degree of orientation, which results in the inhibition of impulse activity.
Orientation testing.
Single receptive field cells across the retina, LGN, and primary visual cortex are in a state of continuous neurotransmission. Impulse activity is the continuous state of regular and constant neurotransmission between neurons. 
Tests conducted by David H. Hubel and Torsten N. Wiesel (1968) utilized a single light dot presented within the visual field of a house cat to map out the location of a cell's receptive field within the cat's visual field. 
Once the receptive field of a cell had been completely mapped out, it was found that some of the simple cell receptive fields mapped out had a region which excited for a stimulus sandwiched between two inhibitory regions. These inhibitory and excitatory regions together formed a single receptive field selective for stimulus shape fitting within the excitatory region. 
Only a bar of light stimulus oriented at the correct angle and position within the receptive field covering only the excitatory region excluding the two inhibitory regions would express the greatest increase in the rate of impulse activity for that cell.
Some layers of the striate cortex were found to contain orientation and direction selective cells. These cells were referred to as complex cells, and consisted of several orientation selective simple cells inputting into a single Complex cell. This was believed to result in a cell selective for direction and motion input.
These receptive fields were called simple cell receptive fields, and were believed consist of single center-surround LGN input.

Chamber Concerto (Ligeti)

The Chamber Concerto is a work for winds, piano, harpsichord, and strings by György Ligeti. Composed between 1969 and 1970, the work was premiered on October 1, 1970 by Friedrich Cerha, to whom the piece is dedicated, and his ensemble "die reihe". 
The piece is in four movements:
It is scored for flute (doubling piccolo), oboe (doubling English horn), clarinet, bass clarinet, horn, tenor trombone, harpsichord (doubling harmonium), piano (doubling celesta), and string quintet.
The Chamber Concerto uses micropolyphonic textures, which Ligeti describes as, "One clearly discernible interval combination is gradually blurred, and from this cloudiness it is possible to discern a new interval combination taking shape." However, it also demonstrates a shift away from this type of writing in Ligeti's music, and towards a more, melodic, eclectic style.
A typical performance lasts about 20 minutes.

Orangebelly goby

The orangebelly goby ("Varicus marilynae") is a species of fish described by Gilmore in 1979. It is known only from a pair of specimens collected from the eastern and western sides of the Florida Peninsula.
Description.
The orangebelly goby is short in length with an indented forehead, and as suggested by the name is primarily orange in colour. The dorsal fins are covered by yellow stripes, whilst the body ranging from the head to the base are covered in khaki stripes, some of which are comparatively longer in length. The species can be distinguished from close relatives by unbranched pelvic rays, the presence of elongated tips on four of the pelvic rays, a fifth vestigial pelvic ray, a bilobed tongue and scales beneath the leading dorsal fin.
Distribution and habitat.
The two existing specimens originated from the Florida Middle Grounds in the Gulf of Mexico, and off the coast of Vero Beach. They tend to inhabit the demersal zone between the depths of 60 to 91 metres, and are often found on shell-hash bottoms with scattered rocks and sand in the vicinity of extant reef systems. These outlined locations are generalisations, as greater population enclaves must be recorded to establish a more specific range.
Behaviour.
In association with other similar species of goby, it is probable that the fish is a planktivore. It would appear that there is no record of the species in the commercial trade market, as the pair caught in the late twentieth century remain the only documentation of the species to date.
Population.
The population of the species remains unknown, as it has only been recorded on two occasions. The nominal records indicate that the specimens were a male and a female, and due to their frequentation of deep subtropical waters, a greater concentration of the populace may be undiscovered at present.
Threats.
The species does not appear to be affected by the shrimp fishery industry, or the commercial pet trade. The only threat that may pose an issue to the orangebelly goby is the potential for predation from the invasive lionfish. The diminutive size of the fish is the primary threat, as juveniles and adults are both relatively small enough to form a portion of the diet of the lionfish. The coinciding habitation of the exposed demarsal zone exacerbates the potential for this risk.

Cyrus Kingsbury

Cyrus Kingsbury (November 22, 1786 – June 27, 1870) was a Christian missionary active among the American Indians in the nineteenth century. He first worked with the Cherokee and founded Brainerd Mission near Chickamauga, Tennessee, later he served the Choctaw of Mississippi. He was known as "the Father of the Missions" in Indian Territory.
Early life.
Kingsbury was born in Alstead, Cheshire County, New Hampshire on November 22, 1786. Almost nothing is known about his parents, who may have died when he was very young. Cyrus was raised in Worcester, Massachusetts by an aunt and uncle. In 1812, he graduated from Brown University with a bachelor's degree. He then studied at Andover Theological Seminary, where he also graduated in 1815. Choosing to become a missionary to American Indians, he was hired as the first missionary by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM).
Starting a career as missionary.
Kingsbury was ordained by the Congregational Church in Ipswich, Massachusetts in 1815. He was first sent to Tennessee in 1817, where he began ministering to the Cherokee tribe and founded Brainerd Mission near Chickamauga. According to A. C. Varnum, Brainerd included not only the mission itself, but also a boarding school and an agricultural school.
Marriage and family.
Sarah B. Varnum, born in Dracut, Massachusetts on January 16, 1784, was one of ten children of Parker and Dorcas (née Brown) Varnum. Her father would become an elder in the Pawtucket Congregational Church. It is not clear when and how she would meet Cyrus Kingston, but evidently the event occurred and a strong attraction ensued. By 1818, when Kingston was preparing to start building with the Choctaws in Mississippi, he had proposed to marry her. Although he wanted to return to New England for the wedding, the church would not allow him to leave his post in Mississippi for a long enough time. Sarah and Cyrus were determined not to wait, but decided to meet in New Orleans. Sarah made the long, arduous ocean voyage unaccompanied from her parental home, while Cyrus came from Tennessee on horseback. They were married in New Orleans on Christmas Eve, 1818. After the ceremony, Cyrus and Sarah made the trip back to Brainerd on horseback, spending their nights camping out and cooking their food over open fires.
Ministry in Mississippi.
In 1818, Kingsbury was sent to Mississippi by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions and assigned to minister to the Choctaw Nation that lived there. His first activity was to establish Eliot Mission. Kingsbury selected a site on the Yazoo River, about southwest of Brainerd.
During childhood, Cyrus had injured a foot when he stepped on a scythe. The injury never healed properly, causing him to walk with a noticeable limp for the rest of his life. Soon after he took up residence in the Choctaw Nation, the tribe gave him a Choctaw name, "NachobaAnowa", that meant"Limping Wolf" in English.
Mayhew Mission.
In 1820, Kingsbury chose a location in the northeastern part of present-day Oktibbeha County, Mississippi that he deemed a suitable site for another mission. He described the location as, "... a point where the Ash Creek flows into the Tibbee Creek.” Cyrus named the site for the Mayhew family, another missionary family from Massachusetts. The Kingsburys, assisted by some other families and three unmarried women, started by building a boarding school, where they taught the Choctaws living around the mission to read, write, study the Bible and other subjects related to earning a living. The school opened on April 30, 1820 with twelve students who lived nearby. Enrollment increased soon to 18, with new students who came from elsewhere in the Choctaw Nation. A church building opened May 6, 1821, and became affiliated with the Tombigbee Presbytery of the Presbyterian Church.
Kingsbury's influence on the Choctaw Nation could be described as spectacular. For example, the Choctaw chiefs began to solicit his advice on how to deal with officials of the Federal Government. They specifically asked him to accompany their delegation to negotiate the 1820 Treaty of Doak's Stand. He did so, and was soon appalled at the U. S. commissioners negotiating tactics, calling the discussions, "Whiskey Negotiations." Kingsbury counseled the Choctaws to cease further negotiations until the commissioners stopped plying the Choctaws with liquor. The Choctaws did so, and the result was a more favorable outcome for the tribe.
Meanwhile, Sarah Kingsbury bore two children, Cyrus and John P. Sarah contracted an unidentified illness and died at the mission five days later, on September 15, 1822. Sarah was buried in the mission cemetery, and Cyrus and the boys lived at the mission for a few more years. When the boys were old enough to go to school, Cyrus sent them back East to be educated. In 1824, Cyrus married Electa May. Well-suited to working as his partner as a missionary, she also saw to the raising of Cyrus' sons. Electa served with him until she died in July 1864. Work continued on the mission, and by 1831, it included a gristmill, a blacksmith shop and a farm. In that year, the Choctaws at Mayhew Mission began their arduous trek to their new homeland in Indian Territory. Cyrus Kingsbury chose to accompany them all the way. 
Cyrus Kingsbury was one of four Mayhew missionaries credited with founding the First Presbyterian Church of Columbus, Mississippi in May, 1829. The other three were Thomas Archibald, Hilary Patrick and David Wright. Mayhew missionaries served the church until 1834. David Wright became the first permanent minister after the church built a sanctuary and obtained its charter in 1844.
Other Choctaw missions in Indian Territory.
One source has claimed that Cyrus Kingsbury established Pine Ridge Mission in 1818, at a site north of Doaksville, and that the mission became the Choctaw Female Seminary in 1842.
Kingsbury has been credited with building the church in the Choctaw town of Boggy Depot in 1840.
Civil War and the Choctaw Missions.
As political unrest increased throughout the country, officials of the various missionary groups realized that Indian Territory could easily divide over the issue of slavery. Missionaries alerted their sponsors that the major tribes were already redefining their loyalties.
Honors.
Kingsbury was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity (D.D.) degree by Brown University in 1854.
Death.
Cyrus Kingsbury died June 27, 1870. He was the only missionary still residing in the Choctaw Nation at that time. He was buried in the Boggy Depot cemetery, where his grave marker can still be seen.
Legacy.
Cyrus Kingsbury's papers are in the Western History Collection at the University of Oklahoma library. A listing of the contents of the ten folders is available online.

Heineken Roeivierkamp

The Heineken Roeivierkamp ('H4K') is an international rowing tournament that is held annually on the Amstel in Amsterdam in the second or third weekend of March. In four days four races are rowed, a day a long one and a short distance.
The Roeivierkamp has been organized by the Amsterdam Student Rowing Association Nereus since 1973 and is an official FISA competition. The matches are open for 'eights' (boats with eight rowers) and for 'double four with' (four rowers, each two belts, with mate / wife). It is a big event with (in 2013) around 3500 participants from various age categories and countries. All rowing clubs along the Amstel will open their grounds and club houses for visiting teams and a large team of volunteers will participate.
There are four distances to row: 250 meters, 750 meters, 2500 meters and 5000 meters. The final score is determined by calculating the results back to a 250-meter time and adding to each other (comparable to the all-round classification in speed skating races). A team that is bad at a short distance, therefore, has to make up a lot on the long distance.
On Saturday, the 2500 and 250 meters are rowed immediately after each other, on Sunday the teams row the 750 meters in the morning and the 5000 meters in the afternoon. The start of the short distances is at the Nieuwe Amstel bridge (between Ceintuurbaan and Ruyschstraat), where two teams are rowing together in the direction of Ouderkerk. The start of the long distances is at the Rozenoordbrug (2500 m) and the Grote Bocht (5000 m) respectively, here the teams start shortly after each other in the direction of Amsterdam. The finish of all distances is for the clubhouse of Nereus at the Amsteldijk at the Berlagebrug in Amsterdam.
The teams can be recognized by their clothing and the blades of the belts. National rowers wear their Dutch shirt under the club jersey, white with an orange band on the arm. Traditionally, the supporters cycle with their team on long distances and encourage them loudly with special slogans. It is good practice that other road users give the cycling fans priority.
The categories in which can be rowed at this tournament:
Men, Light Men and Women 1st division 8+ (Senior A), 2nd division 8+ (Transition), 3rd division 8+ (Novices) and 4th division 8+ (Beginneling / first year)
Ladies Seniors A 4x +
Juniors Boys 8+ and 4x +
Juniors Girls 4x +
Other categories (such as veterans, clubs, boys / girls 16) can also participate in the competition, but do so over 3 distances. The 750 meters, seen as the heaviest distance, is skipped by these teams.
Radio H4K.
Every year during the Heineken Roeivierkamp live report is done by the "Razende Reporters" that can be listened to via both the Internet and a temporary FM frequency. In addition to the live competition report, there is also an evening to listen to various interviews and the races of the past day are analyzed.

Mary Nomura

Mary Kageyama Nomura (born September 29, 1925) is an American singer of Japanese descent who was relocated and incarcerated for her ancestry at the Manzanar concentration camp during World War II and became known as The songbird of Manzanar.
Early life.
Mary Kageyama was one of five children of carpenter Tomitaro Kageyama and his wife, dance teacher Machi Kageyama, immigrants from Japan who lived in Los Angeles. She learned Japanese opera music from her mother, and performed at the Koyasan Buddhist Temple as a four-year-old, but both her parents died by the time she was eight. She was raised by her older brother and sister, both teenagers at the time, who left their high school to keep the family together rather than letting the other children get sent to an orphanage. 
She formed a singing group with two of her siblings, "the Kageyama Trio",
and at age 12 became the only child performer in a pre-war Japanese-American musical group for servicemen.
She went to Venice High School.
Manzanar.
The family was taken to Manzanar in 1942, when Kageyama was 16. There, she graduated from Manzanar High School in 1943, and worked as a receptionist and clerk. She continued her music under the mentorship of Manzanar's musical director Lou Frizzell, who accompanied her while she sang at camp musical performances and recorded two songs. She also sang at the weddings and funerals held at the camp. It was during this period that she became known as the "Songbird of Manzanar".
Later life.
After the war, Kageyama married Shiro (Shi) Nomura. Nomura had seen her perform at a Nisei festival before the war, but they first met at the camp. She continued singing, primarily at concentration camp reunions. Later in life, she jokingly gave herself the name "the Old Crow of Manzanar".
In 2016, actor Cody Edison produced a short documentary film about her, "Songbird of Manzanar".
Nomura's daughter Lisa, son-in-law Gerald Ishibashi, and their children are all musical performers. Granddaughter Brittany Ishibashi is a television and film actress, and another granddaughter, Brooke Ishibashi, has performed professionally as an actor and singer in a lead role in the play "Cambodian Rock Band".

Crown Prince Hyojang

Crown Prince Hyojang (, February 15, 1719 – November 16, 1728) was a Joseon Crown Prince and the first and illegitimate son of King Yeongjo of Joseon. He also become the adoptive father of King Jeongjo of Joseon, his half nephew, but he died at a young age.
In 1762, 34 years after his death, he was adopted to his half-nephew Yi San by his father King Yeongjo and in 1776 was appointed to the title of Honor King, 48 years after his death. His other title was Prince Kyeongui(경의군 敬義君). His real name was Yi Haeng (). His first name was Manbok(hangul:만복 hanja:萬福). His courtesy name was Seonggyeong ().
Life.
Hyojang was born the son of Yi Geum, Prince Yeoning and later Yeongjo of Joseon, and one of his concubines Lady Lee Jungbin of Hamseong (정빈 함성이씨 靖嬪 咸成李氏), Changui-kung, Sunhwabang in Hanseong. He was born during the reign of his grandfather King Sukjong. His birth was not made public or reported in the news, because one year before his birth, his grandmother Lady Chol Sukbin died. His mother, Lady Lee Jungbin of Hamseong, was the daughter of Lee Jun-chul, a noble of Joseon. His first name was Man-bok, which was later changed to Haeng.
In 1720, King Sukjong died due to dementia and Smallpox sequelae and was succeeded by his son Crown Prince Yi Kyun as King Gyeongjong. As Gyeongjong was childless, Prince Yeoning, Hyojang's father was appointed as Crown Prince.
King Gyeongjong died in 1724 and Prince Yeoning was crowned as King Yeongjo of Joseon. Hyojang was then appointed as Prince Kyeongui and in 1725 was appointed to Crown Prince. In 1726, his father selected Lady Hyeon of the Pungyang Jo clan, a daughter of vice prime-minister Jo Mun-myeong and niece of Jo Hyon-myong, also a vice prime-minister, as Hyojang's wife. The two were married but with no issue.
In 1728, Hyojang died suddenly in Gyeongbokgung at the young age of 9, after being ill for some months. The cause of his illness was unknown. The prince's death was devastating to his father King Yeongjo, who was sad for some months. Yeongjo then gave his son the posthumous epithet title Hyojang, therefore his title was Crown Prince Hyojang. Hyojang was buried at Mt. Ahyeon, between Yeonhee Kung and Yonsei University and Aeogae station. On January 26, 1729, his grave moved to Neungan-ri at Jori town in Paju.
After death.
In 1735, seven years after his death, his half-brother Sado was born and succeeded Hyojang as Crown Prince. In 1762, Sado was imprisoned in a wooden rice chest by the orders of his father King Yeongjo, and died 8 days later, leaving his son Yi San as the royal successor. King Yeongjo was concerned that Yi San, being Sado's son and successor, would be branded with the title of "Son of a prisoner" or "Son of a psycho" and thus become ineligible to succeed the throne, so on February 21, 1764, the King decreed that Yi San would become the adoptive son of the long-dead Crown Prince Hyojang.
In 1776, King Yeongjo died of dementia and Yi San succeeded him as King Jeongjo. Surprisingly, on his coronation day, Jeongjo announced to his courtiers, "I am the son of Crown Prince Sado", In spite of this, King Jeongjo did not change the laws of King Yeonjo. Jeongjo later honored Prince Hyojang as an Honor King, and granted him the posthumous epithet title of Jinjong (진종 眞宗) and Great King of Onryangyemyongchulmun(온량예명철문대왕 眞宗溫良睿明哲文大王). Hyojang's wife Lady Cho Hyunbin of Pungyang was also honored as an honor Queen and given the posthumous epithet title of Honor Queen-consort Hyosun(효순왕후 孝純王后).
On July 31, 1907, Hyojang was appointed emperor by Sunjong of Joseon and given the posthumous title of Emperor So Jinjong(진종소황제 眞宗昭皇帝) of the Korean Empire.

Hope World

Hope World is the debut mixtape of South Korean rapper J-Hope. It was released on March 2, 2018 through label Big Hit Entertainment, along with the lead single "Daydream". A second single titled "Airplane" was released a week later. The album's peak at 38 on the "Billboard" 200 caused J-Hope to become the highest charting Korean soloist at the time of release.
Background and release.
Prior to launching his rap career, J-Hope was a member of the underground dance team Neuron, and was subsequently well-known as a competitive street dancer. This eventually led him to audition as a k-pop idol trainee, where he was discovered by Big Hit Entertainment CEO Bang Si-hyuk. J-Hope trained under Big Hit Entertainment for three years alongside members RM and Suga before making his debut as a member of BTS in 2013. Joining BTS as a dancer with no prior rap or music production experience, J-Hope initially did not care for music and found his eventual interest in songwriting and production surprising. He cited his experience coming to Big Hit as an idol trainee as major cause behind his eventual interest. In a broadcast for Naver's V Live, he explained that "I came to Seoul [as a dancer] and met many friends who could rap, like RM, Suga, and [Big Hit Entertainment producer] Supreme Boi, and learned so much from those friends... I think that's how I learned to really love music". Largely due to this inexperience, J-Hope felt that, since BTS' debut, he had been nervous about sharing his music publicly. The release of "Hope World", however, felt like a "new beginning".
The first mention of a potential mixtape by J-Hope came in a concept book paired with the BTS album "Wings", released on October 16, 2016. In an interview portion of the booklet, he was asked if he had any intention of releasing his own mixtape as the other rappers in BTS had done prior. He stated that he was "thinking about it". J-Hope later cited this interest in his solo work, as well as general praise for music he produced, as a major motivation for the creation of "Hope World", labeling it "stimulating". The mixtape is intended to serve as an introduction to the rapper, and his musical style, as well as a culmination of his musical skills up to the point of release. On a personal level, he intended it to express the candid emotions he felt during his time as a producer:
In 2017, J-Hope revealed that the mixtape had begun production, and that he planned to release it only when he felt it was ready. On January 3, 2018, RM mentioned the mixtape in a broadcast for V Live, mentioning that J-Hope had been working on its production, stating that he was "really surprised" by its quality and told fans to look forward to it. In February, J-Hope teased the mixtape in post directed to fans on BTS' Daum portal, writing that "[the mixtape] is soon. Real soon". Following this, he hosted his own V Live broadcast on February 18, reaffirming that the mixtape would be released "soon", but no date was given. Later, on February 28, J-Hope posted various clips of him working on the mixtape to the BTS Twitter page with the text "Hope World". The mixtape's release date was eventually announced through Big Hit Entertainment on February 23. After the announcement, J-Hope posted teaser videos of the mixtape's production.
On February 23, 2018, Big Hit Entertainment announced the release of J-Hope's debut mixtape set for March 2 via a press release. On March 2, 2018, "Hope World" was released for digital purchase and streaming and for free via links on BTS' Twitter in conjunction with a music video for "Daydream". J-Hope released a follow-up music video for "Airplane" on March 7. Aside from interviewing for "Time", J-Hope did not further promote the mixtape.
For "Hope World"s three-year anniversary, J-Hope released a full, three-minute long version of its closing track "Blue Side (Outro)" on March 1, 2021—it was uploaded to the BTS Soundcloud page for free.
Development and music.
Inspired by Jules Verne's 1870 novel "Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea" which captivated J-Hope as a child, the groovy track "Hope World" opened the mixtape with the sound of someone submerging, serving as "an introduction to people who are brand new to [him] with [him] as Captain Nemo showing [listeners] around just as the submarine in the book cruised around the world's oceans." The following track "P.O.P (Piece of Peace) Pt. 1" embodied J-Hope's name and wish to "become...hope for someone in the world — not even some grandiose peace but just a small shard of it." In the 90s-vibing "Daydream" with its lazy vocals and bouncing bass line, J-Hope desired to emphasize "the ordinary guy named Jung Ho-seok" behind J-Hope's public persona and used the track as "an outlet to talk about the desires and wishes that every person in the world has but [he has] to hold down and cover up." Flexing over scratch sounds in the trap "Base Line", J-Hope revealed how he started in music and his gratitude for his life and work, leading into the track "Hangsang" where he playfully flaunted his success and his camaraderie with his bandmates. Inspired by an airplane flight in first-class where "it dawned on [him] that [he] was...in the seat and living the glorious life [he'd] only dreamed about when [he] was young, and had somehow gotten used to now", J-Hope reflected on his success in the track "Airplane" before closing the mixtape with the atmospheric, melancholic track "Blue Side (Outro)".
Commercial performance.
On the week ending March 1, "Hope World" debuted at number sixty-three on the "Billboard" 200 with 9,000 equivalent album sales from less than one day of sales. It reached its highest sales week on the week ending March 8, 2018 with 12,000 equivalent album sales, making J-Hope the highest-charting Korean solo act on the chart at the time at number 38. Three mixtape tracks, "Daydream", "Hope World", and "Hangsang", charted on the World Digital Songs Chart, at number 3, 16, and 24 respectively. The following week, the tracks rose to number 1, 6, and 11, with three additional tracks off of "Hope World", "Airplane", "Base Line", and "P.O.P (Piece of Peace) pt. 1" arriving on the chart at number 5, 6, and 12, respectively. "Daydream" made J-Hope one of only ten Korean groups, including his band BTS, to reach number one on the World Digital Songs Chart. The success of his solo debut led J-Hope to rank at number 3 on the Emerging Artists Chart, and 97 on the Artist 100 Chart for the week of March 10, later peaking at number 91 for the week of March 17. He was the fifth Korean artist, and the second Korean soloist after Psy, to place on the Artist 100. The mixtape charted in ten countries worldwide, with "Daydream" charting in three.

Yountville shooting

On March 9, 2018, a murder–suicide shooting took place at a Veterans Home in Yountville, California. The Pathway Home is a residential treatment program meant to help post-9/11 veterans struggling with PTSD and TBIs reintegrate into society. The shooter, Albert Wong, had attended the program until the home's executive director, Christine Loeber, dismissed him earlier in the week.
Location.
The Pathway Home, was a treatment program run by a non-profit that leased part of a campus of the state-run Veterans Home of California-Yountville. The facility was secured by roaming unarmed 24-hour security personnel for the entire campus, with security cameras installed at The Pathway Homes front door, and hallways as well as a sign in desk. The program worked with veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars with PTSD.
During the incident residents of the nearby veterans home were locked down after reports of an active shooter, and teenagers who were visiting the grounds were evacuated shortly after 2:30 pm.
Incident.
A stand-off started at around 10:30 am when a gunman, later identified as Albert Wong, a 36-year-old U.S. Army veteran of the War in Afghanistan, entered the facility during a going away party. The first 911 call of the incident was received around 10:20 am, and by 10:22 am the dispatcher had named Wong as the perpetrator and that he was armed with a semi-automatic weapon and large quantities of ammunition. Wong initially released veterans and other staff members, holding only Jennifer Gonzales Shushereba, a psychologist, Jennifer Golick and Christine Lobber, the clinical and executive directors of Pathway Home respectively.
Napa County deputies were some of the first to respond to the scene. At about 10 minutes after the initial 911 call Wong exchanged gunfire with Napa County Sheriff's Department Senior Deputy Steve Lombardi and then retreated into The Pathway Home building. After the shootout there was no further contact with Wong or any of the hostages, although three hostage-negotiation teams were on site. At around 6:00 pm, after negotiators from several agencies failed to contact him, California Highway Patrol officers entered the room and found everyone in it shot to death.
 His cell phone was later discovered in his parked car.
Wong was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in the second floor room where he had killed the three female staffers. The Napa County Sheriff’s Coroner determined that Shushereba was 26 weeks pregnant at the time of the incident and that her "unborn baby died due to lack of oxygenated blood caused by her mother's death." State Senator Bill Dodd reported that it was reasonable to believe that the three hostages were killed during or shortly after the initial exchange of gunfire with officers.
Perpetrator.
36-year old Albert Wong had been struggling to readjust to civilian life in California after returning from a tour of duty in Afghanistan in 2013. During his service Wong was awarded an Army Commendation Medal, an Army Good Conduct Medal, and campaign stars for fighting global terrorism and for marksmanship. He had held a professional licenses as a security guard and security trainer, and a firearms permit through the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services from 2008.
He was a resident of The Pathway House, for nearly a year of residential treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) until he was expelled for unspecified concerns about threatening behavior. A family member told reporters that Wong had reportedly told them that he was angry at staff members and wanted to get back at them after he had been found with knives at the facility and told to leave. Wong reported "wanted to get back at them, talk to them, yell at them, not to kill them".
A family member of one of the victims, claimed "People were notified he was violent. Nothing was done. All the proper people were notified...the sheriffs department, the vets' health. Everybody knew."
Aftermath.
The Pathway Home is the subject of the 2014 documentary film, "Of Men and War". After the shootings, The Pathway Home suspended operations indefinitely and its clients were placed with other programs. On August 31 its board members told reporters that the nonprofit plan to terminate the lease, as there was little belief they could effectively aid veterans in the location.
The "Three Brave Women" fund was established and been used to distribute monetary aid to the families of the victims.

Boris Smelov

Boris Smelov, "Petit-Boris" (March 13, 1951 — January 18, 1998) was a Russian and Soviet photographer considered a master of still life, portraits, and urban landscapes. Smelov was the founder of the ‘unofficial photography’ of the 1970s—1990s and is considered as one of the most outstanding Soviet underground artists.
Life and work.
Boris was born in Leningrad, USSR. As a child he was engaged in painting and studied at the mathematical school in Leningrad. Boris had started showing an interest in photography at the age of 10 and began taking classes at Leningrad's Pioneers’ Palace. He consciously began to take pictures at the age of 17.
In 1968, at one of the meetings of the photo club of the Vyborg Palace of Culture, Smelov met Boris Kudryakov, who introduced him to the circle of Konstantyn Kuzminsky. At the request of Kuzminsky Smelov started shooting portraits of unofficial artists and writers. From 1970 to 1972 Smelov studied at ITMO University, from 1972 to 1973 at the faculty of journalism at the Leningrad State University. In the early 1970s, in addition to the city landscapes and portraits Smelov also started working with still live genre. At this time Boris was already working with two cameras — «Leica» and «Rolleiflex». In those years he did not have a personal laboratory — Smelov developed the films and printed his photos in the Leonid Borganov's darkroom located at the Palace of Culture for workers of the food industry (DC «Pishevik»).
Boris Smelov first received public recognition for his photography work in the 1970s. In 1974 he took part in the first exhibition of independent photography «Under a parachute» conducted at the apartment of Konstantyn Kuzminsky. That is when Smelov got his famous nickname, Petit Boris, invented by Kuzminsky while his comrade Boris Kudryakov was nicknamed Gran-Boris.
In 1976, Smelov presented some of his photographs at the Vyborg District Palace of Culture. Due to nonconformist style of Smelov's works the Soviet authorities closed his exhibition and after that any participation in official exhibitions became impossible. Therefore, until perestroika Smelov participated only in illegal apartment exhibitions.
In 1977, he received the Gold Medal for the reportage series at the 11th International Photo Salon in Bucharest. Later Smelov became largely associated with the Mitki group, an art movement emerged from Vladimir Shinkarev's literary work Mitki (1984-1990), which expresses the anxieties surrounding Perestroika in the 1980s. During Perestroika, Boris Smelov began to participate in exhibitions intensively in USSR and abroad including Great Britain, Germany, United States, Finland, Norway, among others. In 1991 he went to Washington, where he took part in the exhibition «Changing Reality». Main theme of Smelov's work was Leningrad — Saint-Petersburg. His name is associated with the notion of ‘Saint-Petersburg still life’. He was using old objects from Saint-Petersburg households to create still life images filled with deep nostalgia for the past. Smelov died at the age of forty-seven in 1998 in Saint-Petersburg. He was buried on January 24 at the Smolensk Orthodox cemetery.
Boris Smelov's works can be found in private and public collections in Russia, USA, France, Sweden, Italy, Great Britain, Germany and Austria. His works are being compared with the pillars of the world photography such as works of Cartier-Bresson, Doyen and Curtis.
Personal life.
From 1974 to 1976 Smelov was in a relationship with clandestine street photographer Masha Ivashintsova, whose works were discovered by her relatives in the family attic and made public. Soon following his separation from Ivashintsova, Smelov began a relationship with a Russian painter, Natalia Zhilina. They married in the late 1970s in Leningrad. Boris Smelov adopted Natalia's children, Dmitry Shagin and Maria Snigirevskaya, who took interest in photography in 1979 thanks to her stepfather Boris Smelov, who had already been a recognized photographer by that time.

Guido Jung

Guido Jung (2 February 1876 – 25 December 1949) was a successful Jewish-born Italian banker and merchant from Sicily, who later converted to Catholicism. 
He was a member of the Grand Council of Fascism and served as Italian Minister of Finance from 1932-35 under Benito Mussolini. Jung was an important player in international finance during the interwar period, leading Italian negotiations with the United States over tariff questions, heading Italo-German economic talks with Hermann Göring, and representing Italy at the London Economic Conference during which he was heralded in press reports for his diplomatic tact.
Jung was ultimately sidelined by Mussolini due to his Jewish heritage, despite reports from the Organization for Vigilance and Repression of Anti-Fascism that described him as a disciplined and loyal fascist. After the surrender of Italy, Jung briefly served as finance minister a second time – in 1944 – under Pietro Badoglio but was dismissed after three months following allegations concerning the extent and depth of his roots in the National Fascist Party. Though a fanatical fascist, Jung drew a sharp distinction between fascism and Nazism, once comparing the Nazi Party to a baby and later reportedly calling Adolf Hitler a "blockhead".
An artillery officer in the Italian Army during both world wars, Jung commanded troops in both Europe and Africa. For various acts of bravery in combat, he was decorated with the Silver Medal of Military Valor on four separate occasions. He was created a knight of the Order of the Crown of Italy by Victor Emmanuel III.
Early life.
Jung was born in Sicily to a wealthy, Orthodox Jewish merchant family who had emigrated from Germany. As a young man, he undertook a business apprenticeship in London.
Career.
Private sector and military service.
Jung took over the family business of fruit importing and ran it to continued commercial success. He also served on the board of directors of the Bank of Palermo, in recognition of which he was, in 1906, invested into the Order of the Crown of Italy at the degree of "Cavaliere".
During World War I, Jung served in the Royal Italian Army's 25th Artillery Regiment, rising to the rank of captain and being decorated with the Bronze Medal of Military Valor which was, on application of Jung's commander, subsequently converted to the Silver Medal of Military Valor.
Minister of Finance (1932 to 1935).
Jung, who in 1922 had served as financial attache at the Italian embassy in Washington, D.C., was elevated to the Grand Council of Fascism in the summer of 1932 by virtue of his appointment as Minister of Finance; the senior ministers of the government were also "de facto" members of the Grand Council. 
Prime Minister Benito Mussolini reasoned at the time that "a Jew should be at the head of finance".
During an official visit by Hermann Göring to Italy, Mussolini assigned Jung to meet with the German minister, prompting David Schwartz of the "Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle" to write that "it must have been a lesson in tolerance". 
In May 1933, he represented Italy to the United States during tariff discussions and was feted with an official dinner at the White House by President of the United States Franklin Roosevelt. 
In a subsequent meeting with Mussolini, U.S. ambassador John W. Garrett reported that "he [Mussolini] was very gratified at the cordiality of Jung’s reception in America".
As minister, Jung helped establish the Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale. He was also the Italian delegate to the London Economic Conference and was credited in news reports with "keeping the conflicting elements of the parley from completely disrupting the conference".
During the same Conference, he signed an agreement, sponsored by Galeazzo Ciano and at the time kept secret to the world, with the minister of China, T.V. Soong, that concluded the long lasting negotiations for the settlement of the Boxer Indemnity and the outstanding amount of the Skoda loan with Italy. 
Political views.
In a 1933 interview with the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, Jung compared Nazism to Fascism by equating it to the difference between "an infant to a ten year-old boy". The following year he is on record as referring to Adolf Hitler as a "blockhead" and a "blatherer". 
While he declared there was no anti-semitism in Italy, Jung also dismissed the very existence of anti-semitism, explaining to Emil Ludwig his belief that it was a "doctrine upheld by those sub-Alpine peoples who could not write at the time Rome saw Caesar, Vergil, and August".
Later years.
After being released from the cabinet Jung, then aged 59, volunteered for military service in Ethiopia ultimately commanding 6,000 men. By this point, Jung had stopped adhering to Judaism. In 1935, he was received into the Roman Catholic faith. 
Nonetheless, in 1939, with the enactment of the Italian Racial Laws, he was dismissed from military service. His personal appeals to Mussolini to grant him an exception went unheeded, despite supporting reports from the OVRA that described him as a disciplined and loyal Fascist.
In February 1944, following the Armistice of Cassibile, Jung was again given charge of the finance ministry.
The appointment of Jung met with concern from the United States, with the U.S. Army's Psychological Warfare Branch charging that Jung had deep Fascist roots that significantly predated his earlier service as finance minister, possibly extending to the March on Rome.
Jung's second stint as minister was short-lived and he was dismissed after just three months. At his request, he was restored to his military rank and assigned, first, to the 184th Artillery Regiment Nembo in the Italian Co-belligerent Army, and then to the Folgore Mechanized Division. During his service in Africa, and his later service in Europe, he would receive a total of three additional Silver Military Medals of Valor.
Personal life.
At least two of Jung's brothers also served in the Royal Italian Army during World War I. Guido Jung died in Sicily.

Aleksandr Galliamov

Aleksandr Romanovich Galliamov (, Tatar: Александр Романович Галләмов , born 28 August 1999) is a Russian pair skater. With his skating partner, Anastasia Mishina, he is the 2021 World champion, 2019–20 Grand Prix Final bronze medalist, and 2019 Internationaux de France champion. On a junior level he is the 2019 World Junior champion, the 2018 World Junior bronze medalist, 2018–19 Junior Grand Prix Final champion, and 2019 Russian national junior champion.
Mishina/Galliamov won the gold medal in their Worlds debut at the 2021 World Championships, becoming the second youngest pair to win the World Championships after Ekaterina Gordeeva / Sergei Grinkov.
Personal life.
Galliamov was born on 28 August 1999 in Berezniki, Russia.
Career.
Early years.
Galliamov began learning to skate in 2005. He was a single skater until 2014, when he switched to pair skating and moved to Saint Petersburg. He and his first partner, Alexandra Polishchuk, skated together through the 2015–2016 season. He competed with his next partner, Nika Osipova, during the 2016–2017 season.
2017–2018 season: Partnership with Mishina.
Galliamov teamed up with Anastasia Mishina in February 2017. Coached by Nikolai Velikov and Ludmila Velikova, the pair won the junior title at the 2017 Golden Spin of Zagreb, their first international event.
Mishina/Galliamov placed seventh at the 2018 Russian Championships and took silver at the junior event. In March 2018, they won bronze at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. They were part of a Russian sweep of the pairs' podium, along with their training partners Polina Kostiukovich / Dmitrii Ialin (silver) and Daria Pavliuchenko / Denis Khodykin (gold).
2018–2019 season: Junior World title.
Mishina/Galliamov started their season by competing in the 2018 JGP series. At their first JGP event of the season they won the gold medal in Bratislava, Slovakia. They were ranked first in both the short program and the free skate and won the gold medal by a margin of more than 11 points over the silver medalists, their teammates Apollinariia Panfilova / Dmitry Rylov. At their second JGP event of the season they won another gold medal, now in Vancouver, Canada. Again they were ranked first in both the short program and the free skate, and again they beat the same silver medalists, Panfilova/Rylov. This time they beat them by about 10 points. Mishina/Galliamov also upgraded their earlier short program, free skate and combined total record scores. With two JGP gold medals they qualified for the 2018–19 Junior Grand Prix Final.
Mishina/Galliamov made their international senior debut at the 2018 CS Alpen Trophy where they won the gold medal with a personal best score of 192.75 points.
At the JGP Final Mishina/Galliamov won the gold medal after placing third in the short program and first in the free skate. They were part of a Russian sweep of the pairs' podium. Mishina/Galliamov beat the bronze medalists, Panfilova/Rylov, by about 4 points but the race for the gold medal was tight. Mishina/Galliamov won the gold medal by a margin of only 1.1 point over the silver medalists, their training partners Kostiukovich/Ialin. At this event Mishina/Galliamov also upgraded their junior-level pairs' record for the combined total (190.63 points) and free program (126.26 points). 
At the 2019 Russian Championships, they competed as seniors domestically, placing fourth in the short program with upgraded jump and throw content. They slipped to fifth place overall after placing fifth in the free skate when Mishina fell on the side-by-side combination jump attempt. Mishina/Galliamov subsequently won the Russian junior national title.
Assigned to the 2019 World Junior Championships, Mishina/Galliamov placed third in the short program after Galliamov struggled on their side-by-side spin. They won the free skate, despite another fall by Mishina on the jump combination, and narrowly took gold over Panfilova/Rylov by a margin of 0.57 points. Galliamov said that being third after the short program had motivate them to perform better in the free.
2019–2020 season: Grand Prix Final bronze.
Mishina/Galliamov began their first full senior season on the Challenger series, competing and winning at the 2019 CS Finlandia Trophy after placing first in both segments.
Making their senior Grand Prix debut at the 2019 Internationaux de France, Mishina/Galliamov were second in the short program behind Daria Pavliuchenko / Denis Khodykin. They won the free skate to take the gold medal, despite Mishina botching their planned three-jump combination. At their second Grand Prix, the 2019 NHK Trophy, they placed third in the short program after a jump problem from Galliamov. They were clean in the free skate, winning the bronze medal and qualifying for the Grand Prix Final. Competing at the Final, Mishina/Galliamov were fourth in the short program, skating cleanly but for their side-by-side spins not receiving a level due to errors. Third in the free skate, they won the bronze medal overall, the highest-ranked Russian team in the competition.
Mishina/Galliamov ran into trouble in the short program at the 2020 Russian Championships, with Mishina falling on their throw triple flip, stumbling in the step sequence, and exiting the pair spin too early. Consequently, they placed eighth in the segment. The free skate proved much more successful, with them placing third, and rising to fourth place overall. She observed "we were not in a good mood, but we were able to recover."
2020–2021 season: World Champions.
In the spring of 2020, Mishina/Galliamov moved to train under Tamara Moskvina, the coach of numerous Olympic pairs champions, and choreographer Alexander Stepin. They debuted their programs at the senior Russian test skates, earning particular notice for an innovative lift in their short program to Cesare Pugni's "La Esmeralda". They were scheduled to compete in the second stage of the domestic Russian Cup, but had to withdraw after Galliamov contracted COVID-19. Subsequently, they were able to compete in the fourth stage of the Russian Cup in Kazan, winning the gold medal over former national champions Tarasova/Morozov and their fellow Moskvina students Boikova/Kozlovskii.
Competing on the Grand Prix at the 2020 Rostelecom Cup shortly thereafter, they placed first in the short program, narrowly ahead of Boikova/Kozlovskii, after both teams made errors. In the free skate, Mishina singled a planned triple Salchow, resulting in a second-place finish in that segment and the silver medal overall, behind Boikova/Kozlovskii.
At the 2021 Russian Championships, Mishina/Galliamov entered with expectations of vying for the top of the podium, but encountered problems in the short program when Galliamov skated through his attempt at a side-by-side jump. As a result, they placed fifth in that segment. The free skate also proved difficult, with both making jump errors and Galliamov almost dropping Mishina in their final lift. Galliamov was uncertain as to why they had performed poorly, but suggested his being unwell the week before may have been a factor.
Following their disappointment at the national championships, Mishina/Galliamov participated in the 2021 Channel One Trophy, a televised competition organized in lieu of the cancelled European Championships. They were selected for the Time of Firsts team captained by Evgenia Medvedeva, and placed second in both segments, while the team finished in second place. After this they competed at the Russian Cup Final, which was widely viewed as a contest between them and national bronze medalists Pavliuchenko/Khodykin for the third Russian pairs berth at the 2021 World Championships in Stockholm. Mishina/Galliamov won both segments of the competition to take the gold medal, their only minor mistake being a free skate jump stepout from Mishina.
At the 2021 World Championships in March, Mishina/Galliamov skated both of their programs cleanly to earn new personal bests in both individual segments, as well as overall. In the short program, the team ranked third behind training-mates Boikova/Kozlovskii in first and Chinese team Sui/Han in second, but in the free skate overtook the two leading teams to win the segment and claim the title unexpectedly. Mishina/Galliamov are the first team to win gold in their Worlds debut since Gordeeva/Grinkov of the Soviet Union in 1986, and the second-youngest pair to win Worlds after Gordeeva/Grinkov. They the concluded the season at the 2021 World Team Trophy, where they easily placed first in both segments to help Team Russia win the gold medal.

On 2 June 2014, due to bifurcation of the erstwhile Andhra Pradesh Anantapur and Kurnool districts were added to the Southern Power Distribution Company of AP Ltd.
AP Power Sector Reforms envisage creation of Distribution Companies as Government Undertakings. The Andhra Pradesh Gazette No.37 published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh on Friday 31 March 2000 declared formally formation of Distribution Companies. In this process, Andhra Pradesh Southern Power Distribution Company was formed for the following six districts of Andhra Pradesh. The corporate office and headquarters of APSPDCL is at Tirupati City

Anarchism in Puerto Rico

Anarchism as a social movement is one of the manifestations of the political left within the working classes of Puerto Rico, having its peak during the late 19th and early 20th century. Anarchism was predominantly present within, but not exclusive to, the working classes that emerged as the sociopolitical environment changed. The municipalities of Caguas and Bayamón were the epicenters of the movement. It was also recorded in other industrial centers, such as Ponce, San Juan, Arecibo, Cayey, Cidra, Juncos, Vega Baja, Utuado, Lares, Yauco and Mayagüez. Despite sharing some core values, Puerto Rican anarchism was heterogeneous in nature. In general, Puerto Rican anarchism was distinctly anti-organized religion, in particular against the Catholic Church that had retained considerable influence since the beginning of Spanish colonialism. Following the Treaty of Paris, it also grew to oppose American sovereignty, as it perceived that the island was being forced into servitude with an Americanization initiative, leading to distinct antiauthoritarian stances against both foreign and local politicians, the wealthy higher classes and American labor unions. However, on principle (as an opposition to nationalism, which was viewed as a manner for the state to consolidate power) the anarchists opposed joining the independence movement.
During the early 20th Century, anarchists were considered a small, but active, minority within the Puerto Rican left. The movement attracted women, particularly younger ones, who felt unsatisfied within what they considered a predominantly "patriarchal society". Initiatives were made to create schools for the uneducated fraction of the population. It also faced unique circumstances among the Latin American anarchist movements, operating under an American colonial administration (whereas all of the others operated in a post-colonial or neocolonial environment), by not conforming to particular ethnic groups and by lacking an influx of Spanish anarchists after 1898. They still opposed organizations that represented Spanish power, such as was the case in 1912, when they participated in an anti-Church campaign led by anti-clerical activist Belén de Sárraga. As part of their internationalist ideals, Puerto Rican anarchists would denounce the working conditions in places abroad, such as Tampa. Ultimately, defection of leaders and government intervention mined Puerto Rican anarchism. Some like Iglesias Pantín did it early and formed an alliance with the AFL, eventually becoming a socialist senator in 1917.
The union's ties with the AFL distanced it from the anarchist roots of Spanish syndicates, from which the local working class had been linked. The former formally adopted a liberal ideology that mirrored their associate. However, with it also came an anti-anarchist sentiment that was predominant within the higher echelons of the AFL. Romero Rosa moved away from anarchism as he made his move to party politics, being elected in 1904. On March 9, 1911, Vilar in representation of the CES lead the tobacco worker's strike at Caguas. During the late stages of the event, two wealthy citizens were shot. The colonial authorities responded by intervening with a number of anarchists, leading to reports of torture. The suspect was eventually tried and found guilty of first degree murder. Vilar was not accused in this case, but the colonial authorities decided to charge him for violating the public morality codes, after he denounced a case of child abuse by a member of the clergy. In 1915, Vilar died while serving the year sentence for which he was convicted. The event led to a crisis in which several leaders either migrated or left for more moderate causes. Another fraction of the Puerto Rican anarchists would migrate to political organizations, such as the Partido Socislista. Figures like Romero Rosa would be lost, in his case becoming increasingly conservative and abandoning his previous political stance.
History.
Background and origins.
The first strike related to working conditions that is recorded took place at San Juan, then the capital of the Spanish colonial government, in 1848. Following the 1868 Spanish Republic and the abolition of slavery five years later, the economic changes pushed farmers to the urban centers of Puerto Rico creating a new working class composed by salaried plantation workers and "artisans" (craftsmen). Following the 1873 decree of free association by Primo de Rivera, tobacco workshops created recreation centers for the employees where liberal ideas were shared in plays held at gatherings (later classified as "a vehicle for class self-affirmation") and which led to the propagation of stances against what was perceived as work exploitation. This was followed by the systematic incorporation of mutual aid initiatives for collective well-being (such Santiago Andrade's Sociedad Amigos del Bien Público) and casinos, such as the Círculo de Recreo y Beneficiencia. Camaraderie between the visitors to these groups allowed the systemic creation of a class identity, reflected in the emergence of cultural elements like Puerto Rican danza being born from it and initiatives to promote literacy (for which specific initiatives, like the Sociedad Protectora de la Inteligencia del Obrero, were created) and formal arts among its members. Later, the role of the "lector" (a literate speaker that was paid to read while the cigar rollers worked) was used to promote literacy and was also used in propagating leftist ideas, cooperativism and an open defiance to the authorities in order to preserve their autonomy.
During the 1880s, following the abolishment of slavery a shift was seen with an increasing working class migrating to novel coffee plantations that were supplanting the sugar plantations of Spanish slavers. By 1890, "lectores" were known at San Juan, which being the capital and a port city, had access to a number of foreign publications where these concepts were discussed in detail. The labor movement, however, remained an emergent entity until late in the decade, and the development of local anarchist mirrored this tendency. At least ten working class newspapers would be created between 1874 and 1897, beginning with "El Artesano". Most were published by region, with four appearing in Ponce and three in San Juan. Soon the educated sectors of this class began initiatives to educate illiterate individuals in the factories, mainly those devoted to the manufacturing of tobacco, where a "lector" or reader would read the local news and political/literary material sampled from the recommendations of a commission (Marx, Malatesta, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.) and chosen by the workers. They would later discuss the content within themselves.
Groups that provided support in case of death or injury/illness were also organized. Cooperatives were first established during this timeframe. The sudden change in the landscape, however, created an over abundance of workers and not sufficient spaces to accommodate them. By the 1890s, strikes were being held to protest an increase in taxes. The appearance of anarchist newspaper "Ensayo Obrero" disturbed colonial governor Sabas Marín González enough to write a letter to king Alfonso XIII of Spain, lamenting the impending expansion of anarchism through Puerto Rico. The functionary requested the Crown to pass laws that prevented the printed publication of the ideas.
In 1896, Spanish-born anarchist Santiago Iglesias Pantín -who claimed to had been involved in the anarchist movements abroad and that he had been forced to leave the Spanish possession of Cuba due to his involvement in their independence efforts- made a scale in Puerto Rico in a transatlantic voyage towards England. Once there, he decided to stay at San Juan, where he found ideological affinity with some of the residents. Towards the end of the decade, the first known copy of Mikhail Bakunin's "Federalism, Socialism, Anti-Theologism" was first recorded in Puerto Rico, being translated and reprinted locally at Mayagüez. This and other books were distributed along propaganda made by local prints and directed to the working class. At the moment, individuals like Ramón Romero Rosa pushed these initiatives as an emancipative strategy. A literate segment of the class (led by figures such as José Ferrer y Ferrer) became increasingly radicalized and adopted the ideas of authors like Bakunin as they became freely available, leading the way for what would become the first groups identified with libertarian socialism.
In 1897, José Ferre y Ferrer, Eusebio Félix, Fernando Gómez Acosta, Ramón Romero Rosa and Eduardo Conde joined Iglesias in founding a CES called El Porvenir de Borinquen in San Juan, which would publish "Ensayo Obrero", where they published from a variety of socialists stances including anarchism. Their bi-weekly reunions centered around these topics, backed by a growing library of anarchist and socialist literature. In 1898, "Ensayo Obrero" introduced female activist Dominica González. By 1900, there were more than 30 CESs throughout Puerto Rico, with San Juan, Ponce, Cayey, Yauco and Mayagüez hosting more than one. These early anarchists believed that workers were intentionally being withheld an education and that patrons were limiting their free time and income towards this end in order to keep them disorganized.
A strike led to the suspension of the lector, but additional pressure allowed the practice to continue.
As CES distribution of publications and propaganda expanded, Esteban Rivera and Gabino Moczo made arrangements for a new institution where the materials were readily available and "El Ensayo Obrero" could be edited. After protests were held the day that Luis Muñoz Rivera swore in as prime minister of the new autonomic arrangement between Puerto Rico and Spain (February 11, 1898), the government and working class organizations were at odds. The Spanish authorities intervened with "Ensayo Obrero", concerned with calls for a labor federation and international collaboration emerged from it. On March 25, 1898, a "proletariat meeting" was formally held led by Eduardo Conde, Ramón Romero Rosa, José Mauleón, José Ferrer y Ferrer, Juan Cepeda, Emiliano Ramos and Santiago Iglesias Pantín. "Ensayo Obrero" was fined, while Iglesias Pantín was held and later arrested. Copies of "Ensayo Obrero" were expected to be sent to them for authorization, which the publishers often avoided resulting in fines and imprisonment for Ferrer and Iglesias.
"Ensayo Obrero" remained neutral on the status of Puerto Rico, as Puerto Rico entered a new autonomy with Spain, the local anarchists took allied with the Autonomist movement in an attempt to reduce the foreign influence and sided with the eventual loser, José Celso Barbosa, since he proposed severing ties to the Spanish Liberal Party limiting the European presence more. The unexpected moderation of this editorial line was met with criticism from the more radical workers, who negatively called it a "conservative turn", while the editors began denying being labelled as anarchists in what they called a stereotypical and destructive sense. Regardless of this, the government withheld the publishing of "Ensayo Obrero" and jailed figures from the labor movement including Emiliano Ramos and Iglesias.
Anarchists vs. American government.
Following the Spanish–American War, autonomy was abolished in favor of a fully colonial administration. The situation worsened for the working class due to a rapid shift in the economic hierarchy, the devaluation of the Puerto Rican peso (later Puerto Rican dollar) and new cabotage taxes implemented by the American colonial government. The American Tobacco Company extended its presence in Puerto Rico, becoming the dominant organization within the local industry. The lack of local unions meant allowed it to supplant the traditionally independent artisan practice of cigar rolling with a systematic capitalist format which led to small cigar shops disappearing and experienced rollers being incorporated to the work force of these corporations and being given a limited role in a process that became increasingly focused on specific tasks. Local rollers, which had been historically self-reliant and had opposed oversight authority and forced structure, began adopting stances sympathetic to anarchism which were combined with the ideas imported from abroad.
After being released by the new government Iglesias, who had been pro-American since his teen years, distanced more from the Puerto Rican independence movement. In turn, John Brooke blocked extradition requests from Spain. On October 20, 1898, the Federación Regional de Trabajadores was formally organized under Sandalio Sánchez. The former members of "Ensayo Obrero" would then fund the Federación Regional de Trabajadores, in which anarchists such as Ramos gained leadership roles, which published "El Porvenir Social". Like its predecessor, the organization failed to establish an ideological consensus and instead tried to establish links with labor movements of the United States and criticizing the Republican and Federal parties that had survived from the Spanish era and remained autonomist. These efforts lead to the recognition of their publication in the anarchist New York-based "El Despertar". Led by Iglesias, the FRT was sympathetic to the Americanization process began by the United States, believing that the working environment there could be beneficial to the local labor movement, and began adopting American socialist initiatives.
Following strikes within the tobacco industry of San Juan, the entity extended to Ponce, Carolina, Aguadilla and Fajardo including the typographic and dock workers (Muelle de Espigón). Eventually further actions lead to a salary increase of 20-25%. Iglesias established an increasingly pro-annexionism stance with the FRT, which contrasted with their 1898 postures. "El Porvenir Social" would remain pro-Americanization, socialism and anarchism, publishing content from anarchist authors from abroad but exhibiting American symbolism. Meanwhile, Iglesias formed an alliance with Daniel de León from the Socialist Labor Party, which sealed to establish a branch in Puerto Rico. The organization also introduced the celebration of May 1 to Puerto Rico, and in its first celebration workers carried the red flag. Leaders including Santiago Iglesias Pantín and Ramón Romero Rosa held reunions with military governor Guy Vernor Henry and San Juan mayor Luis Sánchez Morales, in which they demanded eight-hour shifts among other benefits for the working class. Afterwards, a meeting was held outside the building where "El Porvenir Social" was published.
Another was held at Mayagüez, in which Eugenio María de Hostos addressed the crowd. The pressure of these acts and similar events in at least seven more municipalities led to the passing of a compliant law on May 2, which proved ineffective in its application by the military government. As the group continued their criticism of local parties and promoted their support for annexation, the FRT began developing an internal schism as more of its members became sympathetic to the independence movement and nationalism in particular, citing the principles of "individual freedom" and "respect towards the motherland". This was complicated by some members siding with the Republican Party. This led to Iglesias, Romero and Conde's group to leave the FRT and create both the Federación Libre de Trabajadores (FLT) on June 18, 1899. While adopting an offensive against the wealthy, the FLT was also critical of Puerto Rican nationalism, leading to arguments about Iglesias' status as a foreigner. Anarchists within the organization also faced threats of deportation.
The FLT held two congresses on May 1, 1900, now composed by 30 workers unions and critical of the Foraker Act, they discussed the international scene, eight-hour shifts, propaganda and education among other topics. 
In 1900, the imposition of a foreign governor without democratic vote led to a series of events that concluded with a series of strikes, in which the authorities intervened against the FLT. Having been accused of being an anarchist and anti-American, Iglesias left Puerto Rico and began a drastic ideological shift within the FLT, which lead to ending its association with the SLP, and approaching the American Federation of Labor. Despite this, the FLT members that were left behind continued with their anarchist and pan-socialist stances, including Romero's "La Miseria: Periódico defensor de la clase obrera", which openly made calls to keep worker associations libertarian and questioned the sponsored migration of Puerto Ricans to work in plantations in Hawaii and carnivals. Unsatisfaction with being represented by a Spaniard in the United States was present within some members of the FLT, while others questioned the agenda of the United States in Puerto Rico and denounced Americanization attempts, including Ferrer who lashed at the "American Colossus". Other members of the FLT such as Jesús M. Balsac and Santiago Valle, began arguing for the use of the vote as a political tool to bring forth socialism by creating parties of their own. Several anarchists were skeptical of becoming involved in party-politics, considering them as nothing more than platforms for empty promises.
Ideological mob violence began manifesting against anarchists and Severo Cirino was assaulted while working at the FLT headquarters. Strategic moves also abound and Venacio Cruz and Alfonso Torres began organizing a union at Caguas. May Day 1901 marked the final activities where anarchist stances were institutionally promoted by the FLT.
Iglesias them began to move the FLT away from its previous stances by publishing a piece attacking anarchism as violent and archaic in the "New York Journal" and formally adopted trade unionism and officializing an association with the AFL, which actively opposed anarchists, within days as the materialization of his pro-Americanization stances. This piece was reprinted by "La Miseria". Shortly afterwards, Iglesias reaffirmed his new posture and adoption of trade unionism by beginning arrangements to have the FLT an affiliate of the AFL, gaining influence by being named the AFL organizer for the Caribbean by Gompers and holding a meeting with Theodore Roosevelt. This led to conflict between both camps, centering around disagreements on these issues and the opinions about the United States colonial authority.
Anarchists grew suspicious of Iglesias' motives, in part because he was being paid by the AFL and because his union leadership would work directly with the colonial governors, as a consequence they questioned his fidelity to the Puerto Rican work class and the wisdom of working with the state. Despite this anarchists would continue to use the FLT as a front to push their ideals, and Ferrer y Ferrer collaborated with Pablo Vega Santos to establish a subsidiary at Caguas. Others, like Cruz, would retain some presence in meetings. Iglesias would make his return to Puerto Rico by November 1901.
The FLT experienced issues recruiting and began losing membership during the following years, only preserving a steady presence of carpenters and tobacco workers, which also complicates their coordination funding efforts. Both of these groups had retained their anarchist tendencies more than other offices, which clashed directly with the Iglesias leadership. Paca Escabí would represent anarchists in the 1902 meeting. During the spring of 1902, both Romero Rosa and Fernando Gómez were attacked. Following a confrontation between Federals and Republicans, the FLT protested and in turn had several of its members arrested, including Romero Rosa and Corino. Gómez Acosta was also fired upon during an event, escaping harm. Anarchists were in turn accused of detonating a pipe bomb that resulted in a death at Humacao.
This subordination lead to a move from anarchism to partisan socialism, it combined with unsatisfaction with actions of the colonial administration and resulted in members of the FLT seeking to remove anarchists from the organization. While admitting that not all of them where necessarily revolutionary socialists any longer, the leadership argued against expelling them. Anarchists would remain within the FLT, but published critical material promoting their own postures (in particular attacks on the Catholic Church and local politics) and reprinted foreign authors, with "El Porvenir Social" agglutination both the FRT and the FLT and holding association with anarchist groups throughout Ibero America (including "Ciencia Social", "La Revista Blanca", "El Nuevo Ideal") despite also serving as the SLP's official paper. Content with anarcho-naturalist and anarcho-communist leanings was also published.
The organization's base, however, drifted away from the formal standings of the organization and allowed enough room for anarchists to thrive in their methods to use it as a tool to promote their ideology among the workers. The arts –plays, poetry, chorus and concerts – were used to push the far left's concepts. Centers of study would serve to create a class of "organic intellectuals" that would then become involved in educating the illiterate, writing books/propaganda and hosting tribunes and discussions. Independent unions would emerge, but none grew powerful enough to be able to rival the FLT, instead infiltrating the ranks and creating splinter groups within it.
On May 1, 1901, Palmiro de Lidia's "Fin de Fiesta" (under the guise of "socialist drama".) was highlighted in the festivities. Local anarchist plays would emerge, including Enrique Plaza's "El Anarquista", Ramón Romero Rosa's "La Emancipación del Obrero, Rebeldías", Luisa Capetillo's "En el campo, amor libre" and "Como se prostituyen los pobres", José Limón de Arce's "Redención", A. Millán's "El poder del Obrero" (a.k.a. "La mejor venganza") and J.M. Santiago's "Los crímenes sociales y Peluchín el limpiabotas" (a.k.a. "La obra del sistema capitalista").
Impromptu tribunes were organized in public plazas, but they frequently concluded in confrontations with the police.
Anarchism grew increasingly popular among tobacco workers, but was also present among carpenters, barbers, binders, builders and shoemakers among other lines of work. The former were responsible for most strikes against the Trusts, and of distributing literature. They believed that strikes were the route to bring anarcho-communism by recovering the rights that they thought were appropriated by their patrons. These were still a minority and fell in conflict with other factions, in particular the workers affiliated with the Tobacco Workers International Union, who among other things accused them of being double agents tasked with destroying the unions from within.
Shortly afterwards, the FLT was openly pushing candidates. Anarchists, however, were skeptical that the winners of the event would favor anything besides capitalism and began a campaign against political events. This stance lead to a direct confrontation between the movement and the United States authority in Puerto Rico, which they felt had allowed for an increased control by American corporative interests and the AFL. The FLT leadership supported an alliance between their Partido Obrero Socialist.
In places like Caguas, the FLT subsidiaries were dominated by the distinctly anarchist nucleus such as Ferrer y Ferrer and Pablo Vega Santos. Juan Vilar's Solidaridad would become the first recorded anarchist group to operate independently. In 1903, Venacio Cruz published "Fragmentos", where despite heavily reaffirming his anarchist postures in the poem "Época Insana", he also offered respect to Ferrer y Ferrer and to Iglesias despite ideological differences. Escabí once again represented the ideal at 1904 FTL meetings. She repeated this the following year, being joined by Marcela Torres de Cirino, in an effort to discourage the organization's involve with politics, a call that wasn't heard by the leadership. Meanwhile, Luisa Capetillo began writing at Arecibo and later she would take the role of lector.
By 1904, the FLT was actively working with Partido Union and Romero Rosa – having published the pro-suffrage, anti-authority, anti-capitalist and anti-colonialism work "La cuestión y Puerto Rico" – won a seat as a delegate on the argument that workers could use their numbers to change these things. He would champion the eight-hour shift, and was in turn pressured to promote other initiatives such as the minimum working age for typographers. Rosa published "Catecismo Socialista" in 1905 in which he once again argued from an anti-state posture and concluding that only libertarian socialism or its counterpart, parliamentarian socialism, could solve Puerto Rico's issues. However, Rosa's political work angered some anarchists within the FLT, who used the "Unión Obrera" newspaper as a venue to vent these frustrations and label him a "sold out" and once again urged against becoming involved with political parties.
In 1905, Balsac pressed for a variant of anarchism that he called "free socialism" in his "Apuntes históricos (de Mayagüez)". This year was marked with strikes and the press, most notably "La Democracia", began describing the strikers as uneducated being led astray by anarchists. Vega Santos retorted that they had become biased in favor of capitalism and the state, before criticizing that the government that considered itself democratic "threw strikers in jail". While Winthrop was increasingly concerned with the anarchist presence in the FLT, the strikes led to a 10-hour shift and a wage increase. This author also held the government-sanctioned carnivals in contempt and expressed being deeply disappointed that the working class would participate in them, a similar concern was shared by Fernando de Mantilla. José G. Osorio thought the same of taverns, distancing the Puerto Rican movement from the popular "beer halls" of their European counterparts. Publishing a book titled "¡Solidaridad!", fellow anarchist Alfonso Torres labeled Americans as equal to the previous Spanish regime and dismissed the elections as a way to legitimize the representation of individuals that did not understand the conditions of the working class. Despite this, he felt that the FTL-AFL was the best way to push forward the union's social/economic agenda and eventual anarcho-communism, serving as a tool for their own goals. In letters published by anarchists during this year, they consistently labeled the United States as hypocritical for "claiming to be democratic" but utilizing the police to suppress strikes, one in particular comparing the modus operandi to Russia. Escabí would echo Torres' comparison, but argued that the situation had actually worsened for the working class since the American invasion. Both authors would label the administration as mediocre and lashed against governor Beekman Winthrop, both of which were seen as an "imperialist" imposition.
In 1906, the Caguas-Cayey Tobacco Company declared a strike, which was fueled by the anarchist media and soon extended to the Turina and Quiñones factories. The outcome of the protests was considered by the workers as a victory, which they touted in their newspapers, despite several being fired in the process. Confrontations continued, with Republicans emerging on behalf of the state, while arrests were ordered in response to publications. Puerto Rican anarchists actively monitored the international scene and reported on events such as Francisco Ferrer y Guardia's arrest on June 4, 1906. By this point his ideas had been actively adopted in the local community, being promoted by individuals such as Juan Vilar. In the anarchist center of Bayamón, a street was named after Ferrer y Guardia.
By 1906, an increasingly conflicted Rosa published an essay apologetic of anarchism (calling it "an ideal that is extremely honorable and good") titled "El poder de la amistad" as part of "Entre broma y vera", where he also complimented Kropotkin. Later that year he tried running for the Partido Unión, which led to being expelled from the FLT, dying a year later. By publishing "Hacia el porvenir" Venacio Cruz made another anti-suffrage, anti-patriotism and anti-state plight, in the process attacking Romero Rosa. Between 1906 and 1907, anarchists tried to sabotage the impending arrival of the Cigar Makers International Union, which began receiving formal recognition on January of the latter year, believing that it could lead to an American monopoly. Writers including Venacio Cruz criticized the entity for charging a fee that was considered unacceptably high, and argued that workers would become indifferent towards unionism. The CMIU responded that such a stance compromised the entirety of unionism and accused him specifically of being a double-agent. Parallel to this, Pedro San Miguel, Pablo Vega Santos and Juan Vilar worked on the organization of the Great Assembly of Puerto Rican Tobacco Workers. Others wrote abroad lamenting a lack of eagerness for resistance.
In 1908, an atheist library at Ponce distributed the work of Kropotkin among other leftists, despite not being strictly anarchist.
As their agenda against American-style unionism and elections increased, anarchists would continue to chastise any worker that entered political contention and the FLT itself. Through "Voz Humana" the Caguas anarchists openly mocked any idea that the November elections would change anything. A generalized idea that workers were being duped into choosing between two dummy parties – Partido Union and Republican – in a divide and conquer strategy became prevalent within the group, who noted that ultimately the only real power lies in Washington. As the elections approached, Torres' "La farsa electoral en Puerto Rico" and "Político, jamás" were published. However, when the FLT ignored their plight and made a move to become a separate party. In October, Negrín abandoned the union and formed his own, leading to a fight with the foreman of the Porto Rico American Tobacco Company in which he was non-fatally shot. At the elections, the workers running for the established parties fared well, but the FLT's experiment finished with 1% support. Torres criticized through the "Eco del Torcedor". In December 1908, the editors of this publication would be fined following a trial for libel, due to their stances and they decided to relocate to Bayamón before ceasing press.
Resuming their conflict with Iglesias the following year, anarchists wrote abroad to call him a hypocrite and a sellout. Despite this, others also became involved with the FTL-sanctioned Cruzada del Ideal, a campaign to promote leftist ideals throughout Puerto Rico by using cultural and artistic displays. Among those involved was Torres. In 1909, San Miguel and Dieppa created a spiritual successor to "El Eco del Torcedor", the tobacco workers' "Nuevo Horizonte". Having already reached the adult population, Vilar began the first leftist school in Puerto Rico, distancing it from both public and Christian education. He was particularly critical of the children's religious beliefs and the recreation that they were exposed to at gaming parlors, publicly writing about it. Educational initiatives for both adults and children were focused at Bayamón, Caguas and San Juan and their CESs. The execution of Ferrer y Guardia also inspired the anarchists like Vega Santos and Enrique Gómez to lash against public and Christian education, reflecting their intention to follow in the steps of his Modern School system. The establishment of the Centro Racionalista Juventud Estudiosa emerged as a consequence. (nombre completo) 
As the number of women workers grew, especially in the tobacco industry, the writings of Capetillo began to have an effect and by 1910 she had published a newspaper named "La Mujer". That same year, anarchists led by Negrín began a fundraiser for strikers at Tampa by themselves, following indifference from other working class groups. It was not until a Floridian letter complaining that the only help came from Bayamón was published at "Ensayo Obrero" that others would join.
Most of San Juan's Nuevas Ideas group were anarchists led by Severo Cirino and Alfonso Torrs, the latter of whom credited Vilar with inspiring the idea.
Within a decade, the FLT membership had increased to 54 unions. During these years, the celebration of May 1 would retain far left influences. After the AFL adopted Labor Day, the FLT followed. Despite it being considered an "official celebration devoid of a revolutionary past", anarchist plays such as Pietro Gori's "Primero de Mayo" and Palmiro de Lidia's "Fin de fiesta" would be exhibited during them. When the Dr. Ruiz Soler Sanatorium was being constructed, the tobacco workers paid for a building for tuberculosis patients. They organized a number of funds that were redirected to other initiatives, such as students abroad. Their practice of donating money to fuel strikes elsewhere led to the creation of a blacklist to keep certain workers out of the factories. Within the first decade of American sovereignty, the workforce in cigar rolling increased nearly 200% as the ATC reached nearly 80% of the market. This facilitated the propagation of anarchist ideas among some workers, which came to resent American intervention in Puerto Rico. This early form of libertarian socialism coexisted with other socialist tendencies among the working class. In 1910, ¡Solidaridad! became Trece de Octubre to honor Francisco Ferrer y Guardia and a meeting was held to commemorate his death where plays and artistic manifestations were organized. This was short lived, and within a year they were named Juventud Estudiosa.
That same year, another activist advocated withdrawing the FLT from any electoral event, Antonio Quiñones Ríos, and delegates supported the move ending their political incursion and providing a moral victory for anarchists. The Labor Day activities held at Caguas were hosted by Vilar and according to Vega Santos, were the largest working class gathering seen at the city up to that point. Despite this, a shortage of tobacco leaf and Vilar's health as he developed sharp stomach pains and blurred vision threatened the CES that year, forcing it to focus on innovative approaches including a band, a short-lived attempt to publish a paper and more plays. A conglomerate of groups joined to hold a meeting on the anniversary of Ferrer y Guardia's death, in which they advocated for the adoption of his education model. As Vilar worsened he received some aid, but soon afterwards this stopped coming and his wife also fell ill, infuriating the leader who wrote seven letters critical of the state of the working class and why he felt that they abandoned the CES during his illness. Responses to this were mixed, Enrique Gómez of the FLT accused him of misappropriating union funds, but colleagues in Bayamón helped pay the treatment when he exhibited psychiatric symptoms. In 1911, Jímenez, Barrios and Negrín supported the strikes by publishing a specialized paper, "¡La Huelga! Órgano Defensor del Movimiento". After leaving to New York in 1912, Capetillo continued writing to anarchist papers on the topic of anarcho-feminism. Parallel to this, Francisca Barrios wrote in the local and foreign anarchist press.

The publications linked to Ferrer y Ferrer were clear in their anti-government stance, believing that any form of government was oppressive in nature, while also bearing characteristics of positivism in their belief that once the control was removed, everything would fall into place. Protests were promoted as the ultimate tool towards this goal, in particular general strikes, while bloodshed was discouraged. However, others like Capetillo had grown to accept retaliatory violence as unavoidable and justifiable, citing the deaths of Ferrer y Guardia and Shūsui Kōtoku as well as the Haymarket affair as examples were the confrontations with the government led to murders that were sanctioned as legal. In general she justified that only a minority of anarchists attacked first, while criticizing the Church and those involved in the 1898 French Revolution of perverting their ideals by using them as justification for killing.
In March 1911 a black tobacco worker and anarchist named Ventura Grillo was involved in a strike and amidst the tensions assaulted the trio of Ángel Núñez, José María Berríos and Rafael Ceferinos. Attempts to have him interned in a facility for the mentally ill failed. However, the newspaper "La Correspondencia" publicly labeled him as insane. On March 9, 1911, Grillo decided to retaliate by firing a gun against Adrián Pérez of E. Moreno and Co. in Caguas, also murdering an innocent bystander named Pedro José Díaz who tried to help. In later writings, Santiago Iglesias tried to link the incident to an association between the target and the West Indies Corporation. Two days later Justo Andrade, a sympathizer of the state, responded by murdering striker Alfonso Reyes. In response, Centro 11 de Marzo -an anarcho-communist reunion center and library at Bayamón- was created by a group led by Negrín, Ramón Barrios and Epifanio Fiz Jiménez.
Grillo would confess that he was an anarchist and that others conspired with him, but defend himself by claiming that Pérez had declined the strikers demands the previous day. These events created a crisis for Puerto Rican anarchism, since the police responded by multiplying their presence at Bayamón and Caguas, while the reading of far-left literature was prohibited. Juan Vilar was arrested. The secret police under the orders of San Telmo breached the Centro 11 de Marzo and confiscated all literature and propaganda. Having offered strategic support to strikes among the tobacco workers, the intervention forced its closure. Juventud Estudiosa suffered the same fate. The processing of 33 arrested workers was overseen by prosecutor Acosta Quintero. As more buildings were breached in search of associates that had been declared fugitives such as Enrique Plaza, military governor Colton joined Telmo in entering Vilar's Centro de Estudios Sociales. Propaganda, literature and newspapers were confiscated. A joint effort by tobacco workers, the FLT, Federación Espiritista and others provided food and legal defense to the arrested. Meeting with the military governor also took place.
Acosta would label the suspects as an "anarchist cell" and the dismantled CES would be described as an "anarchist club". The prosecution argued that the CES had tried to manufacture dynamite sticks, but most were released. Vilar was briefly released, only to be arrested again. He would remain in custody along Grillo, even as the others were released, after the police failed to gather information of an "anarchist conspiracy". While the Tribunal Supremo granted him a release on habeas Corpus violation the state appealed and he remained in prison. At Caguas, Acosta charged him with "crime against honesty" for publishing an article linking a pedophile to the Church (republishing articles from the "La Voz del Cantero" newspaper). Vilar was found guilty, sentenced to remain in jail for eighteen months and fined on April 26, 1911.
Grillo's trial began the following month and the defense cited "temporary insanity", exploiting the press portrayals which failed to convince a jury that convicted him on first degree murder charges. Colton would receive complaints of several of the arrested, who claimed irregularities with the process, illegal domicile searches, illegal interrogation, inhibition of legal aid, libel, assault and false imprisonment. While the colonial governor and general attorney Foster V. Brown conceded that Acosta had overstepped, they were apologetic about the situation and justified his actions. In June 1911, the appeal in Vilar's case was seen by the Tribunal Supremo, which ratified its previous stance that an habeas corpus violation had taken place. Anarchists would shift the focus of their activities to Bayamón.
Afterwards, Colton himself would speak ill of the Juventud Estudiosa CES and blamed it for Grillo's actions, all the while claiming that he would "not tolerate breaking the law or backstabbing plots from anarchists", emphasizing that "anarchy and anarchist societies have no room in this territory". The Grillo case would have a significant impact on the anarchists' propaganda, with the lector being controlled to prevent its propagation. However, anarchists and other radicals would continue their activism, attacking the corporations by using the legal system. When Andrades went on trial for the murder of Reyes, a group led by Negrín served as witnesses, and the jury found the defendant guilty on November 3, 1911. That same month, however, St. Elmo placed Tómas Vega, Francisco Pagán and Luis Aguilar on trial at Bayamón for pushing anarchist ideals in public, for which they were all fined. Vega Santos warned about an impending strike on the CES. The detective would focus on 11 de Marzo and Colton authorized the police to breach the building, which led to its permanent closure. Vilar tried appealing his charges on "honesty", a case which eventually found its way to the Tribunal Supremo with the collaboration of the FLT, which in November upheld the conviction of the Caguas court but reduced it by six months. His health worsened rapidly and Espiritistas including Juan Obrer and the editor of "Iris de Paz" magazine Ramón Negrón Flores began fund raising to help him. Vilar was released in 1912 and published "Páginas libres", but his health issues prevented any significant contribution afterwards and he died on May 1, 1915.
Work in exile and distantiation of leaders.
The upper echelons of the FLT did not use the events at Caguas to give exposure to the involved as symbols or "martyrs" for the cause, while the government stopped discussing them in their media, as a consequence of this anarchism would experience a sharp decline in support. Concurrent to this, the FLT's arguments for pushing trade unionism through political parties became more popular and anarchists lost more ground within the workers. The tobacco trust also decided to use the events as justification to ban those involved in the strike, crippling the movement by precipitating the migration of its leaders to diverse locations, including New York, Habana and Tampa. The anarchist migrators joined other leftists like Bernardo Vega.
Joining those that left because of lack of work were the ones that intended to avoid the government, in total being the majority of the prominent anarchists. Despite their exile, they continued in communication with Puerto Rican colleagues and informed of their status. In example, after a strike erupted within the local sugar industry, an assembly to support the workers was organized by the exiles at Lexington Avenue, in which figure such as Ángel María Dieppa, Rafael Correa, Herminio Colón, Ventura Mijón and Antonio Vega make appearances. They also mingled with foreign anarchist-friendly groups such as Industrial Workers of the World. At least a dozen, including figures like Dieppa and Plaza, would be active in participating in strikes held abroad.
FLT-backed strikes still raged, between 1913 and 1914 tobacco workers protested, in 1915 agricultural workers destroyed plantations and the police responded by targeting them. As demands to congress for legislation that protected them fell short and the working conditions and wages worsened as foreign corporations took over the local industries, the union began looking at the possibility of going back to politics. In March 1915, the Partido Socialista was born and Iglesias Pantín was named the president of this independent branch. Parallel to this, Severo Cirino denounced the measures that the government of Cuba was taking in the adjacent island. The PS distanced itself from anarchism, but their ideals still found their way into it. Affiliates Juan S. Marcano, Enrique Plaza and José Elías Levis Bernard employed anarchist symbology in their books.
Actual anarchists, however, were divided with a group led Pablo Vega Santos distancing themselves from the posture, while others continued their campaign against party politics. Those that remained, in particular Dieppa, lashed against the new PS affiliates. Vega Santos responded by calling him a traitor and accused him of being a double agent for the wealthy. Dieppa countered by recalling that this was not the first time that Vega Santos had participated in political parties and that he was paid well for it. Despite this, in "El porvenir social" he would argue that even a "Republican socialist regime" would be better than the current state, but not as ideal as anarcho-syndicalism.
In 1914, Capetillo joined the organized workers in Cuba, the following year becoming involved in a strike and endorsing a manifest created by the Federación Anarchists de Cuba. In response to this, president Manuel García Menocal ordered her deportation. Despite this, Capetillo would remain in contact with Anarchists such as Jaime Vidal, who collaborated with her in "Mi opinión". When prominent anarchists like Jean Grave, Malato, Reclus and Kropotkin publicly supported the Allies during World War I, Puerto Rican anarchist Juan José López rebutted the posture as "brainless", citing that it was disingenuous to believe that several of its members really opposed militarism or that a triumph would usher in an era of prosperity or democracy. He argued that in the end, all that it would bring was more homeless and more maimed individuals. Likewise, Dieppa lashed out against soldiers, calling them "the lowest slaves" and "[worse than] a eunuch" urging them to abandon enforcing the state and join the workers. This proved a departure from the influential postures of international anarchism in response to their own values.
Upon returning from their exile, Capetillo and Dieppa, employing their connections in an attempt to aid a struggling anarchist movement. Now lacking a local press, they employed "Cultura Obrera" from New York to publish their propaganda, in exchange funding that paper. After the police interrupted a reunion at the Bayamón FLT in February 1916, both sides clashed, leaving Negrín wounded. At New York, Dieppa, Herminio Colón and Mijón supported the strikes happening within the sugar industry. During this time, Alfonso Torres, Alicea and Rafael Acosta collaborated with Vega.
The legal imposition of the United States citizenship and later the military draft on Puerto Ricans marked 1917. Iglesias had used the FLT and PS to push for the first, while anarchists didn't take a posture on the issue. Consequently, they didn't publicly react to the Jones Act. Resident commissioner Luis Muñoz Rivera and other politicians lobbied in favor of extending selective service to Puerto Rico and Enoch Crowder granted it. Institutionally, the FLT supported it and as president of the PS, Iglesias Pantín did as well. Anarchists, nationalists and independentists opposed the draft and campaigned against it. José M. Alicea was arrested during a month for refusing to register. After local legislation limiting speech and federal sedition laws were passed during World War I, Dieppa publicly attacked the authorities and was arrested, tough the case would later be decided in his favor. Pedro Calleja was detained while returning to Puerto Rico due to possessing Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), membership. As strikes continued to wage during the war, colonial governor Arthur Yager declared martial law and prohibited public demonstrations and leftist propaganda. As a result of disobeying and participating in a strikers meeting, Capetillo was arrested. Her treatment was protested by fellow anarchist Ramón Barrios and sympathizer Epifanio Fiz Jiménez.
During World War I, Bayamón anarchists continued their activism.
At the 1917 general elections, the PS recorded 14% of the vote, electing six members in the municipalities. With Iglesias also winning a seat in the Senate of Puerto Rico, this boosted his argument that this was the way to weaken capitalism.
In 1918, the Grupo Souvarine and a CES was created. PS leader Rojas displayed signs of adopting several anarchist ideas, becoming interested in the Bolshevik Revolution, distancing himself from Iglesias and others within the FLT leadership. In January, the Bayamón and Puerta de Tierra groups were collaborating in a strike within the tobacco industry. Negrín and Barrios travelled to Cuba to coordinate with the groups there. Later, when the DOJ was investigating Florida-based José Martínez Gil, agent Byrd Douglas claimed that he collaborated with the duo. In November 1919, the Juan M. Alicea, Antonio Palau and Emiliano Ramos established El Grupo Soviet de Bayamón. The hybridization of socialist and anarchist discourse continued, and by 1919 Marcano was labeling a number of international anarchists as "martyrs" a posture that he had also expressed in regards to Vilar, who was regarded as a "noble apostle".
An agreement between the tobacco workers and the Trust was reached in 1917. However, two years later a joint effort in Puerto Rico, Cuba and Tampa responded with strikes after claiming that the accord was not being honored. Anarchist Alfredo Negrín was sent to Havana along another delegate to work on propaganda and fuel the strike sentiment. However, they were arrested as soon as they reached port and following the intervention of the Socialist Party and the International Tobacco Union on their behalf, deported from Cuba. A meeting was held to denounce the situation. On February 23, 1919, the federal government breached the headquarters of "El Corsario" at Lexington Avenue on charges of intending to bomb Wilson and arrested, among others, Puerto Rican Rafael Acosta.
In 1919, Ángel María Dieppa published his take on the ideals of anarchism in "El porvenir de la sociedad humana". 
In 1919, while continuing their activism at New York, Mijón and Acosta collaborated with the newspaper "El Corsario". Dieppa and Acosta did their part by supporting strikes in the city. Juan Alicea and his brother, José, created a network that distributed "El Comunista" between Puerto Rico and New York and to create ties between locals and foreign activists.
Among its strategic moves beyond the boundaries of Puerto Rico, "El Comunista" supported the American Communist Party and economically supported the Russian Revolution. The IWW, which had ties to Puerto Rico through Domason Núñez, tried to unsuccessfully establish a local branch. Local anarchists expressed sympathies for their methods and Alfonso Torres defended the modus operandi of the "Wobblies" as "quicker and more economical", for which he was insulted by union leaders.
In May Day 1920, the Bayamón faction created "El Comunista", having adopted the term "comunista" to describe their anarcho-communist leanings, which was distributed internationally and expressed moral support for the IWW. The paper was supported by the income of its distribution at San Juan, Cayey, Ponce, Utuado, Salinas, Río Piedras, Caguas, Tos Alta, Manatí and Cataño besides Bayamón. The inauguration of the paper featured Sandalio Marcial attack the new education system, which anarchists believed promoted American militarism. This would be a talking point for other members, such as Antonio Álvarez and Manuel García, who criticized the formation of the Puerto Rico National Guard, which he expected to "repress" strikes. This went along a critic against president Woodrow Wilson for the US intervention in Central America and the Caribbean, which they considered "hypocritical", since the nation promoted itself as a defender of democracy.
This group demonstrated their independence from the larger unions anarchists by directly attacking the FLT/AFL/CMIU, as they reflected the extent of that their alliance with groups from abroad -such as Tampa, Havana, Key West and Pinar Del Río- by emphasizing their situation and fund raising for strikes. "El Comunista" allowed anarchists to directly attack the union leaders, in particular Iglesias Pantín and Vega Santos, and to attack the Union Party for its pro-independence stance. Venacio Cruz used this juncture to counterattack for the FLT leadership having labeled him a "strikebreaker" (for protesting the fees of the foreign unions in 1905 and later in 1911 and 1914 for distancing from the institutional postures) on several occasions. Juan Ocasión called the former anarchists "submissive". Iglesias used the union organs to fire back and called them "strikebreakers" on the issue of Florida, also lambasting the IWW and accusing Palau of using the FLT to "draft dodge". In response, "El Comunista" published a piece by William Dudley Haywood, which questioned the FLT leaders by recognized the union's affiliates. When Iglesias compared Samuel Gompers to several leftist authors and activists, "El Comunista" mocked the idea and called him a "hack".
The exchanges between Iglesias and "El Comunista" aggravated internal differences within the PS, which combined by the leader's support for Americanization gathered opposition from a group that included non-(and former) anarchists such as Plaza, Marcano and Rojas. At the 1919 convention, Iglesias was questioned about his changing stances on the war and military service. Palau had used this stance to argue that he had placed the union in the hands "of pro-war advocates" and to sell war bonds. The Independence of Puerto Rico was also discussed, with Torres cautiously arguing that it could be used to advance the worker's agenda. Rojas supported the stance, but Iglesias did not allow the status issue to be discussed. A then-liberal and independentist Luis Muñoz Marín approached "El Comunista" and despite speaking well of the work done by anarchists during decades also advocated that the colonial situation was preventing any radical ideas from flourishing and that they had to work within the electoral system while working in parallel to advance the conditions for a social "revolution" so that independence would not lead to the same elite taking over, only to be rebuffed by editor Ventura Mijón who argued that they wouldn't "abandon [their] principles" and disregarded the political status issue by claiming that making "common cause with the American Communist Party" and the Third International was a quicker way to achieve their goals. The issue of independence would be touched in a pro-Soviet article by Amelio Morazín, who argued in favor of self-determination.
Three months prior to the colonial suffrage, Rojas took over the FLT's "Unión Obrera" and offered a sympathetic posture, in response "El Comunista" ceased their attack on Iglesias. At the 1920 general elections, the PS recorded 23.7% of the vote, winning eight municipalities.
The Red Scare was enacted in Puerto Rico as it was throughout the hemisphere. By September 18, 1920, "El Comunista" denounced that it had been denied second-class by the USPS, a common employment of the Espionage Act against far left propaganda during this period. In response, copies were distributed abroad using covert methods and carried by migrating activists.
In July 1920, three issues of "El Comunista" were seized during a raid against IWW members at Arizona. Along this, the newspaper received an increasing amount of money from abroad.
In December 1920, the United States Bureau of Investigation began an investigation on local leftist groups, including the local anarchists. When the relevant report was filed on January 31, 1921, Bayamón was its main focus, under the pseudonym of "Communist Party of Porto Rico". This was coupled with the systematic layoff of workers that along foreign investors had contributed to create a $100 surplus for the paper and in February 1921, "El Comunista" published its last issue. As it came under federal scrutiny, the Bayamón anarchist faction disappeared from the public. It was that same year, when the news of the Soviet suppression of Russian anarchists became widely known, that Caribbean anarchists distanced from them and their form of communism.
Clandestinity and modern anarchism.
Faced with more conflict with the government, anarchist activities in Puerto Rico were taken underground. Whereas they would rely on propaganda and newspaper during the movement's heyday, they would leave little to no paper trail behind after the events that unfolded during the 1920s. 
Capetillo died in 1922, an event that diminished the local anarchists due to her popularity. Alfonso Torres distanced himself from anarchism and went on to gain prominence within the PS. As their movement continued to lose momentum, others like Ramón Barrios, also joined the party. Activism now focused abroad, with Dieppa and Marcial leading similar publications at New York. Meanwhile, José M. Alicea became involved with the Ferrer School. Others, like Emiliano Ramos, continued to contribute to publications abroad.
Meanwhile, Dieppa continued to become involved with the Florida anarchists and as a writer, continued fostering his message. Emiliano Ramos continued his work as a writer for the IWW's "Cultura Proletaria" until 1931. In 1932, Ferrer y Ferrer published "Los ideales del siglo XX", in which he distanced himself from his anarchist past and tried to push libertarianism as a superior alternative while also defending an annexationist posture. J.R. Pérez's contribution in 1933 marked the final correspondence between the Puerto Rican anarchists and the IWW. In 1934, Ventura Mijón participated in the formal foundation of the Puerto Rican Communist Party, with other vestiges of the movement being seen in the occasional public mention of anarchism, mostly emerging as a reaction to the Spanish Revolution of 1936. The rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party monopolized the revolutionary ideas in Puerto Rico.
It was not until the 1960s that a silence of several decades ended, with the creation of the Taller Libertario Luisa Capetillo and their publication of their take on the namesake. Entering the following decade, and now with closer ties to the socialist ideals, the Unión de Socialistas Libertarios emerged from within the UPR and adopted a number of anarchist leanings such as publishing "Bandera Negra" on April 10, 1972, celebrating May Day and giving classes on the concept. During this time, the presence of anarchism was recorded within the students of the Universidad de Puerto Rico, but ultimately this resurgence vanished as other far left ideas were more popular. During this decade, "left libertarians" represented a percent within the Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño (PIP).
After the Luis Fortuño administration passed Public Law 7, which downsized the government and led to thousands of public workers being waved, anarchists made their presence known in a number of marches that followed. These individuals adopted a number of international icons, such as the black flag and the hymn La Internacional. Shortly before the 2010–11 UPR strikes, anarchist students would begin hosting lecture groups at the UPR, gathering a number of unaffiliated sympathizers together. In June 2009, Puerto Rico Libertario was created. The largest group to emerge was Acción Libertaria, which adopted a modified version of the flag of Puerto Rico among other symbology. La Acción Libertaria and Semillas Libertarias made use of the Internet – through blogs and websites – to disseminate information and propaganda. Besides the focus on anarchist education, these groups revived the use of plays. Acción Libertaria's stance is anti-state and anarcho-communist, while the second made emphasis on international libertarian collaboration.
Besides the events that lead to the UPR strikes, other areas were the state "intrudes" in civilian affairs -such as the relationship between development and the expropriation of lands- are of interest to these groups. Another cell organized a conference of the North American Anarchist Studies Network, attracting a crowd of at least 200. A group known as C.C.C. held a number of activities. However, it disbanded after a year, while Acción Libertaria also saw a reduction on its membership. Other, independent groups continued appearing during the mid-2010s. A different modality, anarcho-capitalism, started gaining public exposure in the wake of the destruction that hurricane Maria caused at Puerto Rico. This was a direct consequence of the arrival of a large group of cryptocurrency investors, who when interviewed noted that they intend to create a hub named "Puertopia", from which they hope to implement their libertarian models.
The Puerto Rican punk scene since the 1980s had anarchist ideals in form of bands, fanzines or collectives. Early boricua anarco-punk bands include Actitud Subversiva (1993)from Bayamón, Cojoba (1995) from Carolina or Distorción Rebelde (1995) from Guayama, that wrote lyrics inspired in anarchism. Also fanzines like Zinevergüenza or Factura No Pagada helped to spread the gospel of anarchy in punk circles across the Island. They were even collectives like the F.A.R. (Frente Anarquista Revolucionario) in the early 2000s in Bayamón, Puerto Rico. The latter ones were led by Omar 'Kilín' Quiles (later frontman in Un Final Fatal) and it was composed at one point by 20 to 30 punks and skinheads from the Bayamón inner cities, that lived by the anarco-punk way of life.
Philosophy and political stances.
Self-perception.
Despite heavy European influence, Puerto Rican anarchists considered their own conditions different from other places. In the words of Luisa Capetillo, they perceived themselves as "fair, equitative, humanitarian, amicable, [...] loyal [and] brave", among other things and considered their role as that of protectors and martyrs of a "universal fraternity". Both Ángel María Dieppa and Juan José López argued that anarchism was the way to "harmony", the first labeling it "perfect order without government" and the second a way for "new days, more environment, mate light, more teachings, more realities, more hope [and] a life of cooing and love". Local anarchists expressed their beliefs through pro-revolutionary poetry, stories and plays, all as a manifestation of the desire to abolish the higher classes as the means to secure a social equality. Both Juan José López and Romero Rosa wrote fictionalized accounts of violence being used to bring fort a "social revolution". Initially the Puerto Rican anarchists used the red flag associated with socialism, despite belonging to their own subgroup and their collaboration being only on matters of common interests.
Religion.
Puerto Rican anarchists were distinctly anti-religion and pro-naturalism, with López claiming that it would open the way to eradicating "the monopoly of instructive schools, with the free teaching of rationalism and humanities", free of what he considered "mystical ideas". Romero Rosa was the leftist standard bearer against the Catholic Church, attacking it in 1899 and again in 1904's "La cuestión social y Puerto Rico" where he attacked it as an "instrument" of capitalism.
Ferrer y Ferrer considered the figure of Satan ideal, as he was "free and emancipated". Several considered the teachings of Jesus an early example of anarchic social communism, and argued that he was a rationalist teacher.
Capetillo argued in favor of Espiritismo and also urged anarchists to study the writings of Krishna, Emperor Yao, Confucius, Philo and Jesus, in order to understand their ideas about love. Despite her support for Espiritismo, she urged not to become involved with organized religion. Capetillo's belief was influenced by the work of Leo Tolstoy and she believed that an anarchist life would result in the ideal outliving the physical body and being reborn through reincarnation. Vilar was also interested in Espiritismo and wrote on the individual's "essence" and physical/spiritual components of Nature, which was part of a reciprocal relationship in which spiritists also supported turning their center into "schools that followed rationalist and lay principles", his main protect. Besides their disdain for organized religion, both groups overlap on some issues during the early 20th Century, opposing the death penalty and the consumption of alcohol, as well as pushing for the involvement of more women in their initiatives. This lasted until 1911, when Espiritistas began to distance themselves from class issues. Others, like Juan José López disregarded Espiritismo along the other religions.
Despite a general anti-organized religion posture, the idealism of Puerto Rican anarchism led to a phenomenon where some adopted the practice of "santos laicos" or "secular saints", a monk-like life style that involved renouncing addictive substances like tobacco or alcohol and living their life to denounce them as vices that "corrupted" the working class and "brought misery".
Progressivism.
Capetillo recognized the uncertainty of the future as abstract and "utopic" in nature, but goals and ideas as more concrete and practical. Despite this, some like Venacio Cruz considered the downfall of "bourgeois society" inevitable, and "complete liberation" only a matter of time. Others within the movement, like Fra Filipo, felt that only unions and syndicates would be able to accomplish this goal. Class war was seen as a facilitator for worker class opposition and the motivator of "revolutionary" ideals. Dieppa also believed that no matter how revolutionary their actions at the time were, they would seem unimpressive and "conservative" to future generations. This call was done despite knowing well that they were perceived discordantly by a large segment of the population, either as violent or as delusional.
Political status of Puerto Rico.
A perception that the independence movement was being pushed onwards by members of the higher classes and had become elitist, as well as influence from the AFL and the idea that foreign involvement could help in local confrontations with patrons, moved the mainstream working class towards an annexationist approach as far as political status was concerned. As the devaluation of the Puerto Rican coin in favor of the USD resulted in most of the viable terrains being acquired by American interests, the AFL gained increasing influence over the local labor movement. Anarchists, however, grew increasingly uncomfortable with the "Americanization" efforts taking place on Puerto Rico and directed their suspicions at the AFL's role within them.
As such, they adopted an anti-nationalist stance, but also remained distant from the annexationist ideas. They ultimately rejected all of the political status options offered to Puerto Rico, considering them unsatisfactory and unrevolutionary, instead promoting anarcho-syndicalism as the real solution. Sandalio Marcial attacked the Union Party on the topic, arguing that the institution did not argue in favor of removing power from the capitalists and that Puerto Rico would still remain economically tied to the United States, a type of "bourgeois independence". In 1914's , socialist Rojas argued that even if Puerto Rico became independent, the economy would be in the hands of "foreign capitalists" and argued that in order to overcome capitalism, patriotic ideas would need to be pushed out so that a unified front could emerge between all of the left's spectrum.
Collaboration.
In Puerto Rico, the anarchist movement opposed the influence of the AFL, the politics of the United States, the influence of the Catholic Church and other institutions that they regarded as imposing on the freedom of Puerto Ricans. Alliances were promoted and in the long run, they created alliances with groups as diverse as the freethinkers and the Espiritistas (based on sharing a common interest in their opposition of the Catholic Church) with the posture of some like Capetillo facilitating these links. Vilar also participated in loose associations with members of the FLT and PS, collaborating in common interests. During the 1910s, Bayamón anarchists collaborated with the New York-based "Cultura Obrera" and "Brazo y Cerebro", which were also distributed locally among other foreign publications. During the 1920s, the Soviet-influenced "El Comunista" would publish articles that adopted an anarchist perspective and even feature Ventura Cruz as a collaborator, this before the confrontations between anarchists and Bolsheviks during the October Revolution.
Puerto Rican anarchism is based both locally and in the states, depending on the migration waves throughout history. Early on, its members established themselves within the tobacco workers in New York, Florida and Cuba, where they became involved with local anarchist movements and collaborate with the publishing of propaganda. This characteristic allowed them to forge connections and create international networks within Latin America and the United States. Years after the Cuban-based newspaper "¡Tierra!" was closed down by its government, the Bayamón-based "El Comunista" was created and gained visibility within the Spanish-speaking anarchists, becoming widely distributed locally and internationally. Local propaganda was influenced by a number of foreign books that were distributed in locales, activities and through mail and through formal distribution companies. Correspondence with foreign anarchists and publications further expanded the local ideal, which still exhibited deviations from the European ideas. Anarchist newspapers also collaborated in inter-municipal networks to share resources and content. Puerto Rican anarchists made use of leftist plays that were staged for the public and written abroad for similar purposes. This was one of several efforts of coordination with anarchist organizations in Latin America (i.e. Havana) and the United States (i.e. New York and Tampa), both due to cultural ties and the migration patterns.
Democracy.
Among the more militant sector of anarchism, American democracy was treated as fraudulent and as a refuge for the affluent, calls were made not to participate in the elections. As the support for the United States grew among the working class, Juan José López cautioned against it by citing incidents such as the Haymarket affair and its ramifications, Tampa cigar makers' strike and the confrontations between the federal government and the Industrial Workers of the World, the case of Simón Radowitzky, among other examples against the ideas of Republic-based democracy. He criticized the colonial administration for employing the police to counter strikes and called those that still believed in the American flag and constitution "fools", insinuated that the working class leaders had become tools and only served to discredit the class struggle.
However, an internal dichotomy had emerged early on between figures like Alfredo Negrín, Juan Vilar and Venacio Cruz, who at this point openly disregarded political parties and opposed the FLT and figures like Capetillo and Ferrer y Ferrer who saw some use in them. In respect to this, Ferrer y Ferrer pointed towards the tribal nature of non-working class political parties and accused them of favoritism and perpetuating the power of patrons, he also warned about benefits being offered to quell revolutionary ideas. Cruz equated politics to a "vengeful tribunal" that was established to keep an "iron grip" over the people and that the more that power is legitimized, the more the need for "slaves" would grow. Dieppa, in turn, argued the role of the "social contract" as a tool of capitalism and expressed that politics were used to deepen divisions that distracted from the "true freedom" of Puerto Rico. Romero Rosa accused politicians of only "trying to get a hold of the tit" and disregarding their constituents. Cándido Ruibola summarized the stance by stating that "as long as there are governors and governed, there can't be a [functional] society [...] since all rights are restricted". This antagonism extended to other elements that were believed to be collaborative of this beyond the government itself and patrons/business owners, such as the police.
They also disregarded the Republican model as "absurd" and as just another form of authority equivalent to monarchies or even empires, also refusing to grant legitimacy to any Constitution. They also separated anarchism from socialism in their discourse and considered the latter inferior, criticized parliamentarian socialism, considering that it had grown obsolete and was inherently unbalanced, with individuals consuming more than they worked to produce. They saw the local Partido Socialista Republicano as only interested in winning elections, had grown conformist and lacking a revolutionary cause. In essence, they considered it an idea "of authoritarian legalism". Despite this, they still made references to the red flag -red specter or red struggle- despite this growing distanced from anarchism throughout the world and instead becoming a communist symbol.
Social issues and gender roles.
In sociological terms, anarchists believed that wealth was unfairly distributed as a result of a lack of morals inherent to capitalism, which they equaled to feudalism and slavery in terms of depending of the "exploitation" of the lower classes. Capetillo labeled it "salaried slavery" and considered it even worse than the classical versions. Believing that most inmates ended as such due to lack of education or resources, they condemned the penitentiary system, considering it nothing but a form of punishment that didn't rehabilitate them. Anarchists actually lobbied for the abolishment of the system and its replacement with industrial schools.
Prostitution was a contentious topic, which most anarchists considering it a manifestation of the "social condition", misery and outdated education and condemned its practice, all the while separating it from the women whom they considered were being exploited. Capetillo advocated anarcho-naturalist postures that argued for sexual liberalization. She was one of the few anarchists that saw prostitution as a way for both sexes to satisfy natural urges without the need for masturbation, which perceived as unnatural, and not as something necessarily negative. On the other extreme, Vilar despised prostitution, seeing it as another byproduct of capitalism.
Marriage was also considered a form of slavery, claiming that it "caged" individuals and distracted them from their ideals, in practice preventing them from rebelling. Emiliano Ramos was another anarchist that advocated "free love". In this same line, anarchists believed that anyone that didn't believe in their concept of free love was either "hypocritical or ignorant". In regards to the role of women in society, Capetillo advocated that they should be able to become activists in her "utopia". Capetillo protested "enslaving" gender roles and argued that if women were supposed to teach children, it made no sense to only teach them how to do housework. Ultimately, she concluded that such a family was only possible in an anarcho-communist society. Dieppa was more paternalistic regarding the role of women in an anarchist society, where they would perform work adequate to them and focus on educating the children in their ways after pregnancy.
Puerto Rican anarchist literature.
Entering the 1890s, the Centro de Estudios Sociales, a distinctly leftist organization with heavy anarchist presence, was created as a propaganda tool where anarchist publications were available for free. The colonial government was vigilant of the entity. During this decade, Puerto Rican anarchists joined libertarian and pro-revolution socialists in the creation of a labor movement with the foundation of the Federación Regional de Trabajadores and the Federación Libre de Trabajadores. The tobacco industry was their main origin, with the municipalities if Caguas, Bayamón and San Juan serving as their main bastions. This line of work also influenced the migration of these workers, along their ideology, to other locations in Latin America and the United States. Coming in contact with other anarchists abroad allowed the flow of information to and from Puerto Rico, leading to a symbiosis of information and identifying parallel issues. The FLT and FRT would publish two socialist publications, "Ensayo Obrero" and "El Porvenir Social", which featured some anarchist authors. The former was edited by Ferrer, Gómez and Romero, adopting broad pro-socialist stances with an emphasis on anarchism, which were later adopted by the latter.
In 1905, Juan Vilar published the first local anarchist publication, "Voz Humana" (1905–06) at Caguas. Bayamón and Caguas would serve as base for the publications that followed during the following decade and a half. However, most of these were short-lived. Vilar also collaborated with anarchist publications from abroad, such as "¡Tierra!", which would eventually find their way back to Puerto Rico. Local anarchists would also made use of other newspapers through correspondence, in which they attacked their opponents and exposed their visions for the future. Despite the FLT becoming affiliated with the AFL, anarchists would use their publications to publish their messages, but not without being critical of the first. Publications with ties to the freethinkers and Espiritismo were used. However, the international anarchist press was used prominently to coordinate.
Papers such as "El Despertar" and "¡Tierra!" (since at least October 1903) formed part if this network, with the second being invested in and brought back to Puerto Rico after printing and distributed. Juan Vilar and Pablo Vega Santos lead funding efforts for at least 99 of "¡Tierra!'s" issues, which were headlined by Caguas and San Juan but included at least a dozen municipalities. During the 1910s, the Puerto Rican anarchists based in New York established a link with the publications "Cultura Obrera" and "Cultura Proletaria" property of Pedro Esteve, using both as outlets. Sympathizers in Puerto Rico would fund international anarchist initiatives. Local authors would write columns in these papers, creating links between groups. Tobacco factories, cafés and other working class establishments were used prominently in the distributions of these papers. Books also appeared, like Venacio Cruz's "Hacia el porvenir" and Luisa Capetillo's "Ensayos libertarios" (1907), "Influencias de las de las ideas modernas" (1910), "Mi opinión sobre las libertades, derechos y deberes de la mujer como compañera, madre y ser independiente" (1911), "Influencias de las de las ideas modernas" (1916) and Ángel María Dieppa's "El porvenir de la sociedad humano" (1915) defined the heterogenous ideals of Puerto Rican anarchism in written form.
When writing their propaganda fliers/booklets and newspapers, anarchists were open about possessing subpar literacy, blaming societal norms for this and employing it as a method to distance themselves from the upper classes. In their works, Puerto Rican anarchists expressed the belief that science had become a tool for capitalism and only served the rich and powerful, also caricaturing the formally educated as pretentious and "evil", being capable of perceiving the evils of the world but not of doing enough to counter them. They also held the belief that even those workers that became fully literate would need extended exposure to the working class, or risk becoming assimilated into the ways of capitalist society. Early on, individuals like Romero Rosa and Ferrer y Ferrer were responsible for collaborating with several newspapers, while others such as the working class "La Miseria" allowed space for anarchists despite a possessing broader scope. In April 1901, they published an article attributed to Charles Pelletier and which directly defends anarchy, as well as poetry praising the philosophy.
In 1902, Pedro Goyco published the satirical "El Anárquista" joining organized groups such as ¡Solidaridad! (Ferrer y Ferrer, et al.) and their "Adelante" newspaper. The latter would then become "Voz Humana" in 1904, published by the same "center for social studies" in Caguas, and was open about its anarchist leanings to the extent of offering the work of several authors along the subscription. This paper encouraged the Caguas-Cayey Johnson tobacco factory strike by publishing a manifesto drafted by the employees. This move led to protests in other factories, namely Turina and Quiñones. "Voz Humana" made a number of approaches abroad, collaborating with the Catalan "¡Salud y Fuerza!" and contacting the adjacent "El Productor Libertario", as well as a number of Spanish newspapers including "Tierra y Libertad", "El Porvenir del Obrero", "El Proletario" and "La Voz del Cantero". Its closest international contact was with "¡Tierra!" from Havana, which had subscribers in at least eleven Puerto Rican municipalities. In exchange, authors like Juan Osorio, Alfonso Torres and Paca Escabí wrote for the Cuban newspaper.
Ferrer y Ferrer would also be involved in 1904–06's "Humanidad Libre" (along founder Juan Vilar, Prudencio Rivera Martínez, Tadeo Rodríguez and Pedro San Miguel), "Hijo del Pueblo" (along Venacio Ortítz) and "Avante" (along Vilar, Rivera, San Miguel, Rodríguez, Antonio Arroyo and Pablo Vega Santos). "Voz Humana's" tendency to publish earnings, spendings and subscriber lists provided enough information for the use in police raids, ergo, using pseudonyms (such as Ferrer y Ferrer's "Rabachol") and systematically creating several newspapers became a common practice that served as a way to avoid government censorship or starting a new publication after the former one ran out of funding. Other works include Juan José López's "Voces libertarias" and Juan Vilar's "Páginas libres".
Other sources would also contribute to the spreading of anarchist literature. A number of publications unrelated to the philosophy, like "El Combate", "La Sotana" and "El Obrero Libre" gave their ideas space for articles. By 1909, the tobacco workers introduced the newspaper "Nuevos Horizontes". That same year, members of the FLT began publishing "Luz y Vida" magazine, publishing the work of Juan Montseny Carret and covering figures like Francesc Pi i Margall and Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, among other working class topics. In 1910, a group that included San Miguel and Rivera Martínez founded the Club Ideas Nuevas, a repository of liberal literature, and adopted the magazine.
In 1920, the anarcho-communist publication "El Comunista" began being published in Bayamón, finding its way to international anarchist organizations. Following the Red Scare, the American colonial administration intervened with this group, amidst a reactionary popularization among Latino anarchists in the United States that had resulted in investment coming from abroad. The move concluded in the closing of the newspaper and the destabilization of the Puerto Rican anarchist movement.
Legacy and influence.
Academic study.
Anarchism in the Caribbean as a whole remained unpopular among historians until the 1990s. While the local labor movement had been studied and documented for decades, mentions of the role of anarchists within it were scarce, brief and/or negative. In literary works, anarchism has been used as a replacement for disorder, as was the case of Concepción G. de Font's "Anarquía Monetaria" which had related to coin exchange and had little relevance to the political definition of the term. When covering a series of strikes held by the Republican José Mauleón, Fernando J. Matías employed the term despite the disorder being in support of a political party in an antithesis of the local practices of the anarchism movement. Cartoonish depictions of anarchists were also present in books, as was the case in "Planta Maldita" (authored by socialist activist José Elías Levis Bernard). The local movement did get occasional mentions in work published abroad, such as "Anarchy: A Journal of Desire Armed". The exploits of Capetillo also gathered attention and she remains the most studied figure within the labor movement of Puerto Rico, gaining the nickname the "Red Emma Goldman of the Caribbean".
Local academics in general, did not cover anarchism in their works. However, foreign authors did mention it, such as Max Nettlau in his 1927 piece "Contribución a la bibliografía anarquista de la América Latina hasta 1914", in which "Voz Humana" is discussed as a libertarian publication. In "Historia social latinoamericana" Carlos Rama made passing reference to the International's presence in the Caribbean. This author later collaborated with Ángel J. Cappelletti in "El anarquísmo en América Latina" which analyzes Puerto Rican anarchism and traces its roots to similar Spanish movements, also discussing their anti-American postures as consequence of the direct relation with capitalism. In "Anarquistas en América Latina" David Viñas discusses local anarchism and granted some credit to the literates, besides the working class, in its creation.
In his book "The Cuban Revolution: A Critical Perspective", Sam Dolgoff cites this as an example of "how little it is known about the anarcho-syndicalist origins of the labor and socialist movements in the Caribbean area".
During the 1970s, while the local economy has shifted from agrarian to increasingly industrial, some Puerto Rican academics incorporated the ideology to their curriculum, but faced opposition by the dominant Marxist leanings present within the community and was locked in an ideological dispute with it. Most of these works questioned the historical narrative that had been adopted since the beginning of that century (which persists today) and introduced the working class as a historical presence that had been omitted, in part due to individuals like Salvador Brau, José Julián Acosta or Cayetano Coll y Toste belonging to a wealthier class. Ángel Quintero Rivera's "Lucha obrera en Puerto Rico" combined with a series of relevant works, which were the basis to create a local study of the history of the working class. The American interventionism in Latin America also emphasized a sociocultural stance among the local pro-independence and socialist groups that influenced this process and facilitated the creation of revisionist academic groups.
César Andreu Iglesias felt that anarcho-syndicalists were the first ideological influence in the Puerto Rican working movement, citing other examples in Latin America. However, Ángel G. Quintero felt that there were deeper circumstances that allowed for this ideology to take hold. Gervasio L. García traces this to socialist libertarian tendencies among the tobacco workers and the "proletarianization" of cigarmakers. In "Apuntes para la historia del movimiento obrero puertorriqueño", Juan Ángel Silén cited some early anarchist work and argued its place in local history.
The centralization of Iglesias Pantín's role and the claim that the American invasion ignited the organization of the working class would remain the predominant posture among local historians until the 1970s, when institutions like the Centro de Estudios de la Realidad Puertorriqueña (CEREP) and individuals like Amílcar Tirado Avilés established that there already were stages of proto-organization prior to it. During the 1980s, Rubén Dávila Santiago published works documenting and supporting libertarian socialism from a cultural perspective, "Teatro obrero en Puerto Rico (1900-1920)" and "El derribo de las murallas: Orígenes intelectuales del socialismo en Puerto Rico". This author's work on the labor movement included Ramón Romero Rosa's play "Rebeldías" and a couple written by Capetillo. In "Historia crítica, historia sin coartadas: Algunos problemas de la historia de Puerto Rico", Gervasio L. García argumentes that anarchism had been relevant until the end of the 19th Century and lost by the 20th.
In 1990, Norma Valle Ferrer published a feminist take on the life of Luisa Capetillo, "Historia de una mujer proscrita", establishing parallels between her and Emma Goldman. Two years later, Julio Ramos published "Amor y anárquia: Los escritos de Luisa Capetillo". García and Ángel G. Quintero discussed the influences of international anarchism and socialism during the early stages of the literate working class in "'Desafio y solidaridad: Breve historia del movimiento obrero puertorriqueño" (1997). In her collaboration for 1998's "Identity and Struggle and the Margins of the Nation-State: The Laboring Peoples of Central America and the Hispanic Caribbean" Eileen J. Findlay offers an insight on gender perception within anarchists of the early 20th Century. In general, Puerto Rican anarchism was avoided by historians in favor of positivist approach that emphasizes select figures instead of movements. During the 1970s, the first attempts to create a parallel narrative were made.
In 2005, Carmen Centeno Añeses published "Modernidad y resistencia", a study of working class literature from the early 20th Century. unlike others that preceded her, she included Venacio Cruz in her research. In 2008, Arturo Bird Carmona published an analysis of early 20th Century tobacco workers at Puerta de Tierra titled "Parejeros y desafiantes", including an ongoing dichotomy between union and anarchist workers. He documented the impact of pre-Partido Socialista anarchists within the tobacco workers of Puerta de a Tierra in San Juan. In 2013's "Black Flag Boricuas", author Kirwing R. Schaffer summarized the environment at Puerto Rico as "twentieth-century anarchists dealing with twentieth-century colonialism". In this respect, the author considered that "the anarchist experience in Puerto Rico was unique in the Americas", since they faced a colonial government (and hence a double fight against local and American interests) instead of a national government.
Upper class teen aged girls that came in the contact with anarchist literature became the symbol used in books and plays to portray a social "awakening".
Popular culture.
Since the 1890s and following the turn of the century, the local media used "anarchism" as a negative term, as something foreign (one, in particular, cites the "miserable" parts of Paris, London or Madrid as its source), self-destructing, capable of destroying Puerto Rican society and preventing its development. Even publications linked to the working class were involved in this tendency. Nowadays, the perception of anarchist as destructive remains within the conservative media, as was the case of "El Vocero" extrapolating the main motivation of the 2010–11 UPR strikes to it. Others, such as centrist "El Nuevo Día", have used the term as a substitute for "chaos". Prior to this, the 1892 publication "El Eco Proletario: Semanario consagrado a la defensa de la clase obrera" promoted the creation of unions, but advocated against strikes and was skeptical about anarchism .
Within the left, it fared better. Anarchist-friendly newspapers included "Voz Humana", "El Eco del Torcedor", "El Sentinela" and "Nuevo Horizonte". The FLT's "Luz y Vida" also published their pieces. In "El Centinela", Severo Cirino advocated and republished the idea about "class parties and workers unions" that came from Europe. In 1910's "Vida nueva" socialist José Elías Levis Bernard portrays his ideas of anarchism through the carácter of "Lisí Archeval". Likewise -while members of the PS- Juan Marcano and Magdaleno González still wrote positively about anarchism in 1919's "Páginas rojas". Despite leaving anarchism for socialism, Plaza depicts a sympathetic depiction of anarchy in 1920's "¡Futuro!" in the form of main character "Rosa".
In recent artistic manifestation, vocalist René Peréz of Calle 13 has self-identified as anarchist in his single "Mis disculpas", having also previously touched on the topic in another song, "Vamos a Portarnos Mal".

Northern Front (RSFSR)

The Northern Front () was a front of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War which was formed on 15 September 1918 to fight the troops of the interventionists and White Guards in the Northwest, North and Northeast of the Soviet Republic. The Northern Front covered the area between Pskov and Vyatka. It bordered the Eastern Front of the Red Army along the Balakhna - Yarensk - Glazov - Cherdyn, Cherdyn line. The Front headquarters were located in Yaroslavl. 
The Northern Front was replaced by the Western Front on 19 February 1919.
Operations.
The North-eastern and Northern area of the Northern Front, had no continuous line of defense, as natural conditions made combat operations impossible in most areas. Operations were mainly conducted along main transport communication lines (rivers and roads).
The 6th Army conducted an active defense along the Vologda - Arkhangelsk - Kotlas - Northern Dvina line. The strategic task of the army was to prevent the joining of the armed forces of the White Movement in the North and the East of Russia.&lt;br&gt;
The 7th Army conducted defensive battles on the outskirts of Petrograd in the Inter-District area, on the Karelian Isthmus and the Narva - Pskov line.
In January 1919, during the Battle of Shenkursk, the 6th Army stopped the advance of the enemy and created favorable conditions for a counter-offensive against Arkhangelsk.&lt;br&gt;
In the winter of 1918 and 1919, the 7th Army conducted an offensive on the Narva - Pskov line, but as a result of counterattacks by the Estonian Army with the support of the Entente and the participation of Finnish and Swedish volunteers, they were forced to withdraw behind the Narva River.
In view of the increasing danger to Petrograd and the need for closer cooperation between the 7th Army, the Army of Soviet Latvia and the Western Army, on February 12, 1919, the Commander-in-Chief formed a new Western Front on the basis of the Northern Front Administration.
The Northern Front itself was abolished on February 19, 1919.

Nadia El Fani

Nadia El Fani (; born 1960 in Paris), is a French-Tunisian film director, screenwriter and producer. She has primarily directed documentary films about human rights, women's rights, secularism, and criticism of religion.
Biography.
Career until 2011.
Nadia El Fani was born to a French mother and a Tunisian father. Her father Béchir El Fani was one of the leaders of the Tunisian Communist Party after independence. He appeared in her film "Ouled Lenine". She is the sister of cinematographer Sofian El Fani.
She began working in cinema as an intern in 1982 in the film "Misunderstood" by Jerry Schatzberg, shot in Tunisia. Next, she became assistant director and worked with, amongst others, Roman Polanski, Nouri Bouzid, Romain Goupil and Franco Zeffirelli. In 1990, she directed her first short film and created her first video production company in Tunisia, Z’Yeux Noirs Movies, to produce and direct her films in this country. Being close to Tunisian militant feminist groups, she began making documentaries in 1993 with "Femmes Leader du Maghreb" and "Tanitez-moi".
El Fani relocated to Paris in 2002, during the postproduction of her first long fiction film, "Bedwin Hacker". She wanted to escape the regime of Ben Ali, Tunisian society which she felt was becoming more conservative due to the pressure of Islamists, and the threats she received for two controversial scenes in "Bedwin Hacker". Thereafter she directed several documentaries, including "Ouled Lenine" in 2008. In the autumn of 2009, El Fani was diagnosed with breast cancer, and began chemotherapy treatment, causing hair loss.
"Neither Allah nor Master" controversy.
The 2011 documentary "Neither Allah nor Master" ("Ni Allah ni Maître", a play on the "Ni Dieu ni maître" slogan coined by French socialist Louis Auguste Blanqui in 1880), in France released under the title "Laïcité, Inch'Allah !" ("Secularism, God willing!"), describes the events leading up to the Tunisian Revolution and those directly following it, focusing on the role of Islam in the public sphere. In the film, El Fani states that the fall of Ben Ali should not only bring about political freedom, but also religious freedom. She defends laïcité (secularism) and warns against the threat of Islamism.
In late April 2011, El Fani was invited by Hannibal TV to discuss her new film on television in a studio with 500 people. She reported that the message of her film was well-understood, and there was no hostility from the audience in the room. Although she confirmed she was an atheist herself, she claimed that "Neither Allah nor Master" was "not anti-religious", but a defence of separation of religion and state. At the time of the interview, she was bald because she was still undergoing chemotherapy.
An edited shorter version of the interview went viral online shortly after, causing an Islamist backlash. During the film's premiere in April 2011 in Tunis, dozens of Islamists attacked the cinema, breaking down the door shouting "Allahu akbar!" with black flags and effectively preventing the screening. Islamist lawyers filed complaints against her film. El Fani received numerous death threats for being an atheist and bald and was the target of massive defamation on social media. One person on social media promised 200 million dinars to whoever would kill her. She decided to flee Tunisia and once again return to France to escape persecution and imprisonment.
Her film premiered in France on 21 September 2011 with the title "Laïcité, Inch'Allah !", and she received the Prix Internationale de la laïcité for it. She was also recovering from her cancer, joking that "The Revolution was the best of the remedies". Although she hoped to return to Tunisia "to live there and finally be free", she was afraid to go and that her passport would be confiscated.
Career after 2011.
El Fani directed "Même pas mal" in 2012. In it, she compares her struggle with breast cancer to the political battle against Islamic fundamentalism.
After Tunisian FEMEN activist Amina Tyler was arrested for posting a nude photo of herself online in 2013, El Fani was one of many who supported her. She shared an image of herself on Facebook with a statement on her chest: “My body belongs to me and is not the source of anyone’s honour.” In 2013, she co-directed "Nos seins, nos armes !", a documentary about the FEMEN movement for France 2.
On 2 June 2017, the six complaints lodged against her in 2011 following the broadcast of her film "Neither Allah nor Master" were dismissed. In November 2017, she returned to Tunisia to present her film "Même pas mal". It was the first time in six years she had been to Tunisia and seen her father, during which the state had banned all her films.
Recognition.
In 2011, El Fani received the Prix de la laïcité ("Secularism Award") from the Comité Laïcité République in France. In 2013, she won the FESPACO award for Best Feature Documentary for "Même Pas Mal".

Saint Andrew, New York

Saint Andrew is a hamlet in Orange County, in the U.S. state of New York.
History.
St. Andrews was founded on land belonging to Henry Wileman's patent of 3,000 acres and took its name from the St. Andrew's Episcopal Congregation and Church which once stood nearby. 
The congregation of St. Andrew's existed as early as 1733, and a log church was standing by 1775. At the beginning of the French and Indian War, an Indian massacre took place in St. Andrews, in which seventeen Indians were killed. During the Revolutionary War, a company of soldiers camped during the winter of 1782 in an area west of the village. In 1806, "several gun-barrels, and an old wrought hand-grenade, with other warlike implements" were discovered in the cellar of a brick farmhouse nearby, which had decayed due to the removal of lead from the pediment and roof for the casting of musket balls.
A post office called Saint Andrew's was established in 1830, the name changed to Saint Andrew in 1892, and the post office closed in 1903.
Official variant spellings have been "Saint Andrew's" and "Saint Andrews".

Publius Vigellius Saturninus

Publius Vigellius Saturninus was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Marcus Aurelius. He is best known as the official who presided at the trial of the Scillitan Martyrs, dated to 17 July 180.
His complete name is attested in inscriptions as Publius Vigellius Raius Plarius Saturninus Atilius Braduanus Caucidius Tertullus. His origins are not known for certain, although Géza Alföldy believed he came from the Greek-speaking part of the empire. Bernard Rémy claims that based on the elements in his name Saturninus is related to Herodes Atticus.
Only portions of the "cursus honorum" of Saturninus, drawn from various sources, remain. His earliest recorded office, based on an inscription on a statue base found at Troesmis was as "legatus legionis" or commander of Legio V Macedonica. It had been thought this brief inscription was evidence that he had been governor of Moesia Inferior, but Alföldy has shown that it is more accurately interpreted as evidence for his command of the V Macedonica. Both Rémy and Alföldy date his commission as extending from the year 159 to 162. Another post he is attested as holding is governor of the imperial province of Lycia et Pamphylia, which Rémy dated from 162 to 164. His term as suffect consul followed. 
The latest office Saturninus is recorded as holding was one of the apices of a successful consular career, proconsular governor of Africa, which was in 180/181; since a senator was eligible for this office about fifteen years after his consulate, his consulate can be estimated to have been around the year 165. It was during his tenure in Africa that he presided over the trial of the six African Christians known as the Scillitan Martyrs in Carthage.
His life after he stepped down from the governorship is unknown.

2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two

The 2019 ICC World Cricket League Division Two was an international cricket tournament that took place in April 2019 in Namibia. It was contested between six teams; Canada, Hong Kong, Oman, Papua New Guinea, the United States and tournament hosts Namibia. It formed part of the 2017–19 cycle of the World Cricket League (WCL) which determined the qualification for the 2023 Cricket World Cup. The final and third-place playoff match were granted One Day International (ODI) status by the International Cricket Council. Namibia won the tournament, after they beat Oman by 145 runs in the final. It was Namibia's first win in an ODI match, and it was the first ever ODI match played by Oman.
Summary.
Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea finished in the bottom two places in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier, therefore relegating them to the Division Two tournament and losing their ODI status in the process. They were joined by Canada and Namibia, who finished third and fourth respectively in the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Two tournament, and Oman and the United States, who won promotion from the 2018 ICC World Cricket League Division Three tournament.
Ahead of the tournament in October 2018, it was announced that, following the conclusion of the tournament, the World Cricket League would be replaced by the ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 and the ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League. The top four teams would join Scotland, Nepal and the United Arab Emirates in League 2 and gain ODI status. The bottom two teams would be assigned to the Challenge League along with other teams from the World Cricket League.
The United States were the first team to qualify for League 2, after they beat Hong Kong by 84 runs in the fourth round of matches. Oman also qualified in the same round of fixtures, after they beat tournament hosts Namibia by four wickets. In the final round of matches, Namibia and Papua New Guinea secured League 2 qualification with big wins. Canada won their final match, against the United States, but finished narrowly behind Papua New Guinea on net run rate and qualified for the Challenge League, along with Hong Kong.
Following the round-robin matches, Canada played Hong Kong in the fifth-place playoff, the United States played Papua New Guinea in the third-place playoff, and hosts Namibia faced Oman in the tournament's final. Claire Polosak was appointed as one of the on-field umpires for the final, becoming the first woman to stand in a men's ODI match.
Teams.
Six teams qualified for the tournament:
Preparation.
The United States took part in a one-week tour to Antigua, playing five matches, starting on 10 February 2019. USA Cricket also looked at arranging warm-up fixtures against Australia and Pakistan, followed by two Twenty20 International (T20I) matches against the United Arab Emirates, and some 50 over matches in the UAE during March 2019. Oman hosted a Twenty20 International (T20I) quadrangular series followed by three List A games against Scotland in February 2019, before taking part in an eight-team T20 tournament in Kenya during March 2019. Canada played practice matches in Sri Lanka and South Africa before naming their final squad.
Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong were both aiming to regain ODI status after losing it at the conclusion of the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Canada were attempting to regain ODI status that they had lost in 2014, and had recruited the experienced Monty Desai to help guide them back to the top tier of Associate cricket. Hosts Namibia had been regulars in the top divisions of the World Cricket League, but their only previous ODIs were back in 2003, and they had faced a lack of international cricket in the months prior to the tournament in relation to their opponents. The United States were competing in Division Two for the first time, and were a team on the rise following a change in administration. Oman's form had fluctuated since qualifying for the 2016 World T20, the low point coming when they were bowled out for just 24 runs in a List A game against Scotland in February 2019.
Fixtures.
The following fixtures were confirmed in January 2019.
Playoffs.
The final and third-place playoff matches were given ODI status by the ICC, with the fifth-place playoff being a List A match. Oman played in their first ever ODI match. The United States played their first ODI match in fifteen years, after playing two matches in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy in September 2004.

Irene Delroy

Josephine Lucille Sanders (July 21, 1900 – June 14, 1985), known by her stage name Irene Delroy, was an American stage actress. 
Early years.
Born Josephine Lucille Sanders, Delroy was the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Roy Sanders of Bloomington, Illinois. She attended Bloomington High School and University High School.
Career.
Delroy's stage debut came when she appeared as a ballet dancer with the Chicago Opera Company. During a visit of that company to New York City in 1920, she left the group to join a fledgling production, "A Night Off", in Plainfield, New Jersey. Two weeks after the debut, the inexperienced producers left to return to their former jobs. Delroy returned to Chicago and joined a production of "Angel Face", which soon ended during a strike by the Actors' Equity Association.
She made her Broadway debut in the musical revue "Frivolities of 1920". She starred in the "Greenwich Village Follies" from 1923 through 1926 and the "Ziegfeld Follies of 1927". She also had leading roles in the musicals "Round the Town" (1924), "Here's Howe" (1928), "Follow Thru" (1929), and "Top Speed" (1930).
A review of "Greenwich Village Follies" published in "The New York Times" on December 25, 1925, noted that Delroy was "radiantly beautiful and sweetly graceful and tuneful" in the production.
Hans J. Wollstein, writing on the AllMovie website, described Delroy as being "completely wasted by the new audible motion picture industry in 1930." She appeared in "Oh! Sailor Behave" (1930), "The Life of the Party" (1930), and "Men of the Sky" (1931).
Personal life.
Delroy retired from the entertainment business after marrying W. L. Austin, Jr. on July 15, 1931. He was president of Island Park Associates, Inc., the company that operated Atlantic Beach and part of Rockaway Point. While they were on their honeymoon in Murray Bay, Quebec, Canada, she fell from a horse. Her injuries included "a slight fracture of the skull and slight concussion; a double fracture of a finger, and dislocation of one of the bones about the hip." They were divorced on July 1, 1937.

Laboratory experiments of speciation

Laboratory experiments of speciation have been conducted for all four modes of speciation: allopatric, peripatric, parapatric, and sympatric; and various other processes involving speciation: hybridization, reinforcement, founder effects, among others. Most of the experiments have been done on flies, in particular "Drosophila" fruit flies. However, more recent studies have tested yeasts, fungi, and even viruses.
It has been suggested that laboratory experiments are not conducive to vicariant speciation events (allopatric and peripatric) due to their small population sizes and limited generations. Most estimates from studies of nature indicate that speciation takes hundreds of thousands to millions of years. On the other hand, many species are thought to have speciated faster and more recently, such as the European flounders ("Platichthys flesus") that spawn in pelagic and demersal zones—having allopatrically speciated in under 3000 generations.
Table of experiments.
Six publications have attempted to compile, review, and analyze the experimental research on speciation:
The table summarizes the studies and data reviewed in these publications. It also references several contemporary experiments and is non-exhaustive.
In the table, multiple numbers separated by semi-colons in the generations column indicate that multiple experiments were conducted. The replications (in parentheses) indicates the number of populations used in the experiments—i.e. how many times the experiment was replicated. 
Various types of selection have been imposed on experimental populations and are indicated by the selection type column. Negative or positive results of each experiment are provided by the reproductive isolation column. 
Pre-zygotic reproductive isolation means that the reproducing individuals in the populations were unable to produce offspring (effectively a positive result). 
Post-zygotic isolation means that the reproducing individuals were able to produce offspring but they were either sterile or inviable (a positive result as well). 
Negative results are indicated by "none"—that is, the experiments did not result in reproductive isolation.

<doc id="56800477" url="?curid=56800477" title="Bolsón night lizard">
Bolsón night lizard

The bolsón night lizard ("Xantusia bolsonae") is a species of night lizard in the family Xantusiidae. The species, which was originally described by Robert G. Webb in 1970, is endemic to the state of Durango in Mexico. Not much is known about the lizard at present, as it appears to be simultaneously rare and rather secretive in nature.
Description.
The bolsón night lizard is predictably small, due to its behavior and habitat. It tends to be around 6 centimeters (2.4 inches) in snout-to-vent length (SVL) length, with a similar tail length proportionate to body size. The body is covered by scales, totaling 50 in the dorsal region, featuring leopard print markings of a dark brown pigment across the back. The species can be distinguished from close relatives through fewer rows of dorsal scales, a decreased number of upper labials, a lack of dark peppering on the stomach, fewer femoral pores, a narrower head to body ratio, and an attainment of reduced eventual size at the end of maturation.
Distribution and habitat.
The species is prevalent in the state of Durango, in particular the area around the township of Pedriceña. It has also been reported in the nearby Cañon San Fernandes protected reserve, and has been observed crossing State Highway 40. The lizard inhabits fissures in adesitic rock outcrops, predominantly within areas dominated by yucca vegetation. Physiographically, the area falls within the boundaries of the Bolsón de Mapimí and the Chihuahuan Desert.
Reproduction.
"X. bolsonae" is viviparous.
Population.
The population size of the species "X. bolsonae" is currently unknown, but the lizard seems to be quite rare. The lack of accurate population data can generally be attributed to the secretive nature of the species, creating issues in regards to collecting and examining specimens. During the initial survey of 1969, researchers located ten male and female individuals including the holotype, and recent colored photographic evidence from 2007 proves that the species is still extant in the original location of surveyal.
Threats.
The only apparent threat to the "X. bolsonae" is the disturbance of the habitat in which it resides. The habitat is not particularly wide-ranging in size, and is concentrated to only a fairly localised area. However, due to a lack of knowledge regarding the species, it is impossible to determine the impacts of habitat encroachment until a later interval.

Nototeuthis

Nototeuthis is a monotypic genus of squid, in the family Neoteuthidae. The only species in this genus is Nototeuthis dimegacotyle . This species is characterised by short tentacular clubs, less than 40% of the length of the mantle, and relatively long fins, which are approximately 60% of the mantle length. The tentacle clubs have two greatly enlarged suckers on distal portion of the manus, which distinguish "N. dimegacotyle" from other members of the Neoteuthidae. Few specimens of this species are currently known. Specimens have been collected from the south eastern Pacific Ocean, off Chile, between the Southern Subtropical and the Antarctic Polar frontal zones. This species is mesopelagic to bathypelagic and can be found from near the surface to a depth of ~500m.

Svenja Schulze

Svenja Schulze (born 29 September 1968) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) from Münster in Westphalia.
Schulze currently serves as Minister of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in the fourth coalition government of Chancellor Angela Merkel. From 15 July 2010 to 30 June 2017, she was State Minister of Innovation, Science and Research of the State North Rhine-Westphalia.
Early life and career.
Schulze was born in Düsseldorf. She completed her school-leaving exam in 1988 at the Gymnasium Norf in Neuss. She then studied German Studies and Political Science at Ruhr-Universität Bochum, which she completed in 1996 with the academic degree of Magistra Artium. Afterwards, she worked as a freelancer in the advertising and PR industry. From 2000, she worked as a management consultant specializing in the public sector, including at Mummert &amp; Partner, BBDO and Booz &amp; Company.
Political career.
Schulze joined the SPD in 1988 and served as county spokesperson for North Rhine-Westphalia from 1988 to 1989, then as a member of the Socialist College Association and chair of the AStA at the University of Bochum. As part of her studies, she also did an internship at Alice-Salomon-Berufskolleg (Bochum). From 1993 to 1997, Schulze was North Rhine-Westphalia's regional leader of Jusos, from 1996 to 2002, and since 2006 she has been a member of the North Rhine-Westphalian board of her party.
Career in state politics.
From 3 June 1997 to 1 June 2000, and from 22 October 2004, Schulze was member of the Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia. She last moved in for Frank Baranowski, who had been elected Lord Mayor of Gelsenkirchen. In the 2005 and 2010 elections she was again elected to the state parliament. At the election on 13 May 2012, she won the direct mandate in the Münster II constituency and was directly elected to the state legislature with 40.1 percent. In 2007, Schulze took over the chairmanship of the SPD sub-district Münster from Christoph Strässer and held it until 21 May 2011.
After 2010 state elections, Minister-President Hannelore Kraft appointed Schulze as State Minister of Innovation, Science and Research of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia (Cabinet Kraft I). With the abolition of tuition fees in North Rhine-Westphalia, Schulze launched one of the government's major political projects. During her term, the so-called "nuclear sphere affair" regarding the AVR reactor in Jülich occurred. On 21 June 2012, she was appointed again as State Minister of Innovation, Science and Research in the Cabinet Kraft II.
From 2017 until 2018, Schulze served as Secretary General of the SPD North Rhine-Westphalia, in this capacity supporting interim chairman Michael Groschek. On 8 December 2017, Schulze was elected to the SPD national board, under the leadership of chairwoman Andrea Nahles. On the following day she was also elected to the SPD Presidium.
Federal Minister of the Environment, 2018–present.
In the negotiations to form a fourth coalition government under Chancellor Angela Merkel following the 2017 federal elections, Schulze was part of the working group on education policy, led by Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Stefan Müller and Hubertus Heil. On 9 March 2018, she was nominated by the party executive committee of the SPD as Minister of the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in the new government. When Germany held the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2020, she chaired the meetings of its Environment Council.
In October 2020, Schulze announced that she would run for a parliamentary seat in the 2021 national elections.
By 2021, Schulze oversaw the introduction of legislation under which farmers in Germany would have to gradually reduce their use of glyphosate and stop using it completely from 2024 in order to preserve clean habitats for insects.

Eugene Smurgis

Eugene Smurgis (19 August 1938 – 15 November 1993) was a Russian Arctic marine explorer, ultra-long distance rower and Arctic rowing pioneer. From 1967 to 1993 Eugene rowed a total of 48,000 km on oceans, seas and rivers; a distance longer than the circumference of the Earth and the greatest distance ever rowed by a solo ultra-endurance rower. He completed 9900 km of coastal polar ocean rows. Most of his pioneering rows were completed in the Arctic in a primitive open boat with no cabin or crawl space. He was the first recorded polar ocean rower, as the earlier Antarctic expedition by Ernest Shackleton predominantly relied on sails and used oars only to a marginal degree, therefore not meeting the criteria of ocean rowing.
Birth of the passion.
Eugene Smurgis worked as a physical education teacher in Perm Oblast. From there he undertook his first long distance rowing voyage to Lipetsk. By the summer of 1967 aboard his newly made boat "MAX-4" together with Valery Lyutikov, he rowed down the Kama and Volga Rivers of Russia, and up the Don.
After the voyage he realized that full-time teaching was not compatible with his newly discovered ultra-endurance passion. He quit teaching to become a commercial hunter and woodcutter. For the rest of his life, he would follow the same basic pattern of rowing summers and working winters.
Ultra-endurance river rowing.
Over the next twenty years, Eugene Smurgis rowed 36,700 kilometers of inland waterways, navigating all the major rivers and lakes of Russia, and later Siberia. In 1971, he went alone, crossing part of the Caspian Sea in thirteen days. In 1976 he went solo for twenty-six days. Two years later, he rowed north to the Kara Sea, alone that time for 40 days and 40 nights, all in a boat with no cabin, and no crawl space.
Beginning of the off-coast ocean rowing.
In 1986, together with his 15 years old son, he embarked on his longest adventure yet, 4,800 kilometers over 44 days. The Smurgis team rowed the Amur River, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Sea of Japan, finishing in Vladivostok. In 1987 he rowed 1,400 more kilometers on the White Sea and the Onega River.
First encounter of the Arctic.
In 1988 he voyaged to the northern Siberian community of Tiksi at 72 degrees north latitude, "ice and pale blue water" to commence the around-the-world expedition. Although he often had to drag his boat, now "Pella-Fiord", over rough pack ice, he reached Khatanga, 1300 kilometers away, in 30 days.
More pioneering in the Arctic Waters.
In 1990, he rowed the waters around Cape Chelyuskin, reaching a latitude of 77 degrees north, and finished at Dikson, reputedly the coldest place in Asia. His total for the second leg was 2,100 kilometers in 65 days. Within this expedition he established the 27-year standing record of 'the Northernmost Latitude reached by a rowing vessel'.
On 30 September 1992, Eugene, again together with his son, Alexander reached Murmansk, an ice-free port and the largest city above the Arctic Circle. Since leaving Dikson, father and son had covered 2,500 kilometers in 43 days.
Next they rowed Murmansk to London, whose distance was 4,000 kilometers, much of it spent above the Arctic Circle. In total, the row was 88 days.
Last quotes.
"It has been a constant battle against the weather," Eugene told an interpreter upon arrival in London, "but at no time did we allow ourselves to feel afraid." With a touch of national pride, he added, "The boat was made by craftsmen from the Urals, so we knew it would get us through even the worst storms." 
Before his son, Alexander was detained as an illegal immigrant by English authorities, a BBC interview asked about the voyage so far, in which he responded to the question: "How tough was it?", with a shake of his head and a mumbled,"Very difficult." 
Eugene, now left alone to his plan of continuing the journey West, was advised by the coast guard to stay inland and row the canals. He responded, however: "I don't want to soak my oars in fresh water anymore. I am an ocean rower now." Kenneth Crutchlow, head of Ocean Rowing Society, who together with Vanya Rezvoy researched the life of Eugene, commented: "His diary supports the impression of a man lacking the gene for fear." Crutchlow also mentioned that due to financial difficulties Eugene had to ration his food on daily basis. In one of the last journal entries quoted in Crutchlow's book "The" "Ocean Rowers", Eugene wrote: "my spirits are usually high. But once it gets dark, my spirits go down with the temperature. But it will be fine. The biggest ventures in life are hard, but you must do them all the way to the end." Crutchlow concluded that: "Eugene had a bulldog grip on his expeditions".
He rowed into a storm at the Bay of Biscay and at the age of 56, and for the first time in his life, lost a battle with a storm, which he sometimes reported in his journals to have been the only guests celebrating his birthdays with him, during his 20-year pattern of embarking on a rowing expedition every summer.
Legacy.
The boat of Eugene is exposed in the garden of the Maritime Museum of La Tremblade, in Charente-Maritime, France.
A Library in Lipetsk, Russia is dedicated to and named after Eugene Smurgis, containing a small museum displaying his photographs and expedition maps.
A Memorial stone erected in honor of Eugene Smurgis is located in Kilkee, Ireland
In 2010 a French writer Annie Héral-Vieau wrote a book about Eugene, titled, "Eugene Smurgis, the ocean rower"
20 years later, ocean rowing expedition "Old Pulteney Row to the Pole" attempted a coastal Arctic ocean row. The team of 6 rowed 202 nautical miles (a distance 26 times shorter than Eugene Smurgis Arctic rows) in 40 days (speed several times slower than Eugene Smurgis solo rows).

Koyunbaba Bridge

Koyunbaba Bridge () is a stone arch bridge crossing the Kızılırmak River in Çorum Province, Turkey. It was built between 1484 and 1489 and is the longest stone arch bridge built in Anatolia during Ottoman rule.
History.
Koyunbaba Bridge is located at the center of Osmancık district in Çorum Province, northern Turkey. It was built between 1484 and 1489 during the reign of Ottoman Sultan Bayezid II (r. 1481–1512). The -long and -wide bridge was constructed in ashlar. It spans the Kızılırmak River with 19 pointed arches, of which today only 15 arches are visible due to sedimentation on the river bank. It is the longest stone arch bridge built in Anatolia during the Ottoman Empire era. The bridge is named after the 15th-century local Turkish saint Koyunbaba. An inscription in Ottoman Turkish alphabet gives the beginning and completion dates of the construction in Hijri year as 889 and 894 without naming the architect.
Restorations.
The bridge saw many restorations. In the 1960s, the original ashlar pavement was replaced with -thick concrete and covered with asphalt. In the 1980s, the facades of the bridge were plastered with compounded mortar and slurry was used in the mortar joints. Over time, the mortar on the facades crumbled. The latest restoration work aiming to reinstate its original state began in July 2014, and continued until 2017. After removal of the mortar on the facades in the first instance, the bridge was closed to motor traffic and pedestrians for further restoration work in November 2015.

Great Acceleration

The Great Acceleration is the dramatic, continuous and roughly simultaneous surge in growth rate across a large range of measures of human activity, first recorded in mid-20th century and continuing to this day. Within the concept of the proposed epoch of anthropocene, these measures are those specifically of humanity's impact on Earth's geology and its ecosystems. In the concept, the Great Acceleration can be variously classified as the only age of the epoch to date, one of many ages of the epoch – depending on the epoch's proposed start date – or a defining feature of the epoch that is thus not an age, as well as other classifications.
Environmental historian J. R. McNeill has argued that the Great Acceleration is idiosyncratic of the current age and is doomed to halt in the near future; that it has never happened before and will never happen again. However, climate change scientist and chemist Will Steffen's team have found that evidence is inconclusive to testify or rule out such a claim.
Related to Great Acceleration is the concept of accelerating change. While not explicitly commenting on whether the Great Acceleration as a whole is set to continue into the near future, the common implication is that the particular trend of accelerating progress will not cease until technological singularity is achieved, at which point technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unfathomable changes to the Earth and sometimes even the universe itself. Therefore, while adherents of the theory of accelerating change do not comment on the short-term fate of the Great Acceleration, they do hold that its eventual fate is continuation, which also contradicts McNeill's conclusions.
Overview.
In tracking the effects of human activity upon the Earth, a number of socioeconomic and earth system parameters are utilized including population, economics, water usage, food production, transportation, technology, green house gases, surface temperature, and natural resource usage. The Anthropocene is typically depicted as following the Holocene, to emphasize the central role of humankind in geology and ecology. Since 1950, these trends are increasing significantly if not exponentially.
Data classification categories.
The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) has divided and analyzed data from years 1750 to 2010 into two broad categories, each with 12 subcategories. The first category of socioeconomic trend data illustrates the impact on the second, the earth system trend data.

Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria

Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is an autosomal dominantly inherited disease of the cornea, caused by a point mutation in cryopyrin (also known as NALP3) that in humans is encoded by the "NLRP3" gene located on the long arm of chromosome 1.
In keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria, patients suffer from periodical transient inflammation of the corneal endothelium and stroma, leading to short term obscuration of vision and, in some patients after repeated attacks, to central corneal stromal opacities. Approximately 50 known cases have been reported in the literature. The disease so far has only been described from Finland, but exome databases suggest it may be more widely distributed in people of European ancestry.
Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is thought to belong to cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes.
Presentation.
Patients experience repeated unilateral attacks of keratitis 1 to 6 times per year, beginning at the age of 5 to 28 years. Men and women are equally affected. Attacks get less severe and less frequent in middle age. No seasonal variation has been reported. The symptoms are redness of the eye, pain, and photophobia. The attack may be associated with anterior chamber flare. These symptoms disappear in 1 to 2 days, but blurred vision may last for a few weeks.
During the acute symptoms, a slit lamp shows pseudoguttae, dark patches in the corneal endothelium, thought to represent patchy corneal endothelial swelling. The endothelium appears normal between attacks. The attack can be misdiagnosed and treated as an acute iridocyclitis. Visual acuity transiently deteriorates during the attack.
Older patients may show faint to definite central, horizontally oval, bilateral stromal opacities. The opacities may be associated with decreased visual acuity, but they have not been severe enough to need corneal transplantation.
Genetics.
Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning an affected individual must inherit only one mutated allele from one parent. The protein, cryopyrin is coded for by the gene "NLRP3", located at 1q44. The disease is frequent in Finland, and this population has a common mutation D21H accounting for all reported cases in this population. It has not been described in any other populations. However, the mutation was found in exome databases at a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 0.023% and in the Finnish and at an MAF of 0.0090% in aggregated non-Finnish European populations.
Diagnosis.
Upon clinical suspicion, diagnostic testing will consist of identifying cornea pseudoguttata by using a specular microscope or confocal microscope. Molecular genetic testing is also an option.
Treatment.
Patients have reported benefit from immediate treatment of their attacks with a topical corticosteroid or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) applied a few times a day for up to one week. Some patients have found more benefit from an oral NSAID.
Prognosis.
The repeated corneal inflammation over time can lead to reduced visual acuity.
History.
Keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria was first described in 1964 by Olavi Valle (1934-2013), a Finnish ophthalmologist with an interest in hereditary eye diseases. He reported this disease as keratitis fugax hereditaria in a family with 10 affected members over 4 generations. Two decades later, a second Finnish family with 21 affected members in 5 generations was reported by other Finnish ophthalmologists who highlighted transient corneal endothelial changes, and proposed the term keratoendotheliitis fugax hereditaria.

Sparrow Mkhonto

Sparrow Mkhonto (24 December 1951 – 27 June 1985) was a South African anti-apartheid activist, and one of The Cradock Four murdered by the South African police in 1985.
Early life and education.
Sparrow Mkhonto was born on 24 December 1951 in Bhongeni Section of Lingelihle Township (South Africa) in Cradock. He was one of The Cradock Four who were murdered during Apartheid by members of the South African Security Police on 27 June 1985.
Mkhonto attended Macembe Lower Primary, Akena Primary and Sam Xhali Secondary School. Matthew Goniwe was one of his teachers at Sam Xhali. Due to financial constraints, Mkhonto left school after he passed his junior secondary certificate. After he dropped out of school, he established a soccer club in his community. He also became politically active due to the influence of Goniwe.
Political life.
Mkhonto found employment working at a depot in Cradock for the Department of Railways and Harbours. He subsequently joined the railway workers union. His work at the union had attracted the attention of the security police who conspired with his employers to fire him on spurious charges. He was dismissed from work in 1983 as he was accused of being a communist who arranged political meetings during working hours. His wife was also fired from her job at a hair salon on the pretext that her husband was a communist.
In 1983, the Cradock Ratepayers Association (CRADORA) was formed which advocated for the rights of residents to negotiate against unfair increases in rent. This organisation was affiliated with the United Democratic Front (South Africa). He became a senior office bearer for CRADORA as well as the chairperson of the Broad Forum which consisted of CRADORA executives and leaders from other organisations in Lingelihle.
Mkhonto was detained and assaulted by the security police on several occasions. He would be taken to the Cradock security police headquarters where he was assaulted and beaten, then released. He laid a charge against the police but this was never investigated.
During the Freedom Charter celebrations on 26 June 1983 in Lingelihle community hall, Mkhonto spoke on behalf of CRADORA, focusing his speech on the future of the new South Africa which would respect rights to own land and proper compensation of workers for their labour.
Death and honours.
On 27 June 1985, Mkhonto left for a UDF meeting with Goniwe, Fort Calata and Sicelo Mhlauli in Port Elizabeth. The four were never seen alive again. Mkhonto’s body was the first to be found in Bluewater Bay near Port Elizabeth. It was found 1 km from the burnt car in which they had been travelling. He was found burnt, handcuffed and tied with a rope with gunshot wounds to his head and stab wounds to his chest.
A two-year inquest started in 1987 under the Inquest Act No 58 of 1959. The Cradock Four were buried in Cradock on the 20th of July 1985 at a mass funeral. Speakers at the funeral included Beyers Naudé, Allan Boesak and Steve Tshwete gave keynote addresses. A message from the then president of the ANC Oliver Tambo was read.
In 2006, he was conferred by the Presidency of South Africa with the Order of Luthuli in Silver for “outstanding contribution and dedicating his life to a free, just and democratic South Africa’’.
A memorial was erected in honour of the Cradock Four.

History.
Cebu Gems (MBA seasons, 1998-2000).
The team owner was Jean Henri Lhuillier. The Gems had former national player Leoncio Tan, Jr as their first coach, he was replaced by former PBA player Tonichi Yturri during the inaugural season of the Metropolitan Basketball Association in 1998. Yturri would remain coach of the Cebu Gems until the final MBA season in 2002.

Auditory science

Auditory science or hearing science is a field of research and education concerning the perception of sounds by humans, animals, or machines. It is a heavily interdisciplinary field at the crossroad between acoustics, neuroscience, and psychology. It is often related to one or many of these other fields: psychophysics, psychoacoustics, audiology, physiology, otorhinolaryngology, speech science, automatic speech recognition, music psychology, linguistics, and psycholinguistics.
History.
Early auditory research included the early 19th century work of Georg Ohm and August Seebeck and their experiments and arguments about Fourier analysis of sounds. Later in the 19th century, German physicist Hermann von Helmholtz wrote "Sensations of Tone" describing the founding concepts of psychoacoustics, i.e. the relationship between the physical parameters of a sound and the percept that it induces.
Psychoacoutics is primarily interested in the basic workings of the ear and is, therefore, mostly studied using simple sounds like pure tones. In the 1950s, psychologists George A. Miller and J. C. R. Licklider furthered our knowledge in psychoacoustics and speech perception.

Xenochrophis bellulus

Xenochrophis bellulus, the Burmese keelback water snake or Burmese white-barred keelback , is a species of water snake described by Stoliczka in 1871. It is known only from three examples collected in Myanmar, including a recent specimen from 2010.
Description.
The Burmese keelback water snake is relatively small in size, and grow to a maximal length of between 4 and 6 centimetres. The body is elongated with a moderately long tail, and is covered by keeled scales on the dorsal section. 
Distribution and habitat.
The species is endemic to Myanmar, and is believed to have an extensive habitat extending across the interior of the country. The snake has been known to frequent wetlands and freshwater streams surrounding the Irrawaddy River floodplain, designating it as both terrestrial and aquatic, and is therefore believed to be extant at a low altitude.
Behaviour.
Due to status as a water snake, it is believed to be semi-aquatic, inhabiting both wetlands and river systems. The species is believed to be non-venomous, but due to a lack of encounters this has not been confirmed by herpetologists to date. If this hypothesis is proved correct, it is likely the bite of the snake would only cause mild swelling and localised pain.
Population.
At present, the population of the species is unclear due to the wide range of their habitat, and size and trends are currently unable to be determined. However, the snake is known to be rare, as only a single specimen was discovered in 2010 during a twelve-year survey in Myanmar.
Threats.
The area surrounding the Irrawaddy River has undergone intensive deforestation and land conversion for cultivation and agriculture. The extent of the impact upon the species, if any, remains unknown despite the continuance of the changing nature of the landscape.

Juglans regia Zijing

"Juglans regia" Zijing() is a cultivar of walnut developed in Beijing, China, expanded breeding upon the basis of the mother trees of Purple Leaved Walnut, which was founded in the depths of mountains, , Mentougou District, Beijing in 1998.
"Juglans regia Zijing" is named after Wang Xiupo. On October 17, 2017, Wang obtained the certificate of plant variety rights from the State Forestry Administration of China. Because of the Juglans regia Zijing's trees have five major features of purple branches, purple female flowers, purple leaves, purple peel and purple walnut kernels, they are also called Wuzi Walnut (五紫核桃). The trees of Juglans regia Zijing's are mainly distributed in Beijing International Walnut Manor currently.
Growing environment.
Growing at an altitude of about 800 meters above the hillside zones, Juglans regia Zijing's trees have strong resistance and adaptability as well as ornamental value, adapted to temperate climatatic regions. 
Flowering takes place in May of Northern Hemisphere,fruiting in September.
Planting methods.
Gardens selection.
Juglans regia Zijing's trees are resistant, adaptable and have ornamental value. They can be planted and cultivated in Temperate climate regions. Owing to the fact that the Walnuts are light preferring plants, it is better to choose the south slope when building a garden in the mountains in the Northern Hemisphere.
Fine preparation.
Soil preparation is an important method to improve the survival rate, growth and development of Juglans regia Zijing's trees. The time of site preparation is generally conducted in the first half of afforestation. And this method is taken according to the conditions of walnut gardens:in general, slope below 10 degrees or flat ground,a comprehensive preparation for plowing ought to be adopted.For a slope of 10-20 degrees, the site preparation by reverse-slope is supposed to be used. For a slope above 20 degrees, fish-scale pit site preparation should be taken.
Planting management.
The planting time of Juglans regia Zijing's trees is around the germination in late March of Northern Hemisphere. The survival rate of seedlings planted one to two years is higher. After planting, it should be irrigated with water, water and fertilizer management should be strengthened. Weeding should be performed frequently, and attention has to be paid to drainage Juglans regia Zijing during the rainy season. On the other hand, attention has to be paid to the prevention of pests and diseases from June to July of Northern Hemisphere.
Planting and cultivation.
Scion grafting.
Grafting time.
The grafting time of Juglans regia Zijing's trees is appropriate during the period from the rootstocks sprout to the first leaf stage,that is to say,from mid-April to early May in the Northern Hemisphere.
Management after grafting.
Do not irrigate water within two weeks after grafting. At the same time, always check the joints. About 20 days, the scions begin to sprout, and they are observed every 3 days or so. The picking up of the exhibition leaves must be released in time and the air outlets cannot be opened once.
Plate budding.
Scion collection.
Select the developing branches and collect the annual branches without pests in the mid-March of the Northern Hemisphere for the scion.
Grafting time.
Grafting time is appropriate from the end of May to the beginning of July in the Northern Hemisphere.
Management after grafting.
After grafting, the buds on the rootstock should be promptly removed to promote budding and germination.Check the survival rate in about 10 days. The sign of survival is the shedding of the petiole or the sprouting of buds. After budding, the rootstock can be cut about 2 cm above the bud to stimulate growth of budders. When the budders grow to 10 cm, the plastic strips can be removed for growth. When the bud grows to about 30 cm, it can be picked up for safe wintering.[[File:核桃枝枯病.png|thumb|核桃枝枯病|right|300px]]
Prevention and control of pests and diseases.
Branch-withering disease.
The branch blight of Juglans regia Zijing is caused by [[fungal infection]], the main damage to walnut branches, resulting in dead branches. The prevention and control method is clearing the gardens, clearing the diseased branches, and burning them in a concentrated manner, and the chemical controls walnut [[anthrax]].
Bacterial root rot.
Bacterial nuclear root rot, caused by "[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]", makes seedling root and its lateral root cortex decay, resulting in the death of Juglans regia Zijing's trees in part or in whole. The prevention and treatment methods are to select the nursery lands,dry up the soil,disinfect seeds and improve the soil.

1926 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 1926 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the inaugural year of 'track' greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Summary.
On the 6 March 1876, near the Welsh Harp, Hendon, an early attempt to introduce mechanical track greyhound racing took place. It was on a straight course 400 yards long, with the hare being drawn along the ground at the end of a cord, which was wound around a windlass. The venture did not appeal to the public because although the fastest greyhound would always win, the cleverest (best tracker) did not.
In 1890 a patent was taken out for a circular greyhound racing track but was never put into practice, due to the patent owner not having financial backing. Five years later a mechanical lure was used in Ireland and again failed.
Thirty years later, in 1925, Charles Alexander Munn, an American businessman, who had seen greyhound racing in the United States came over to the United Kingdom and teamed up with Owen P Smith and George Sawyer for the rights to promote the British greyhound racing as an alternative to coursing which was the primary form of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland. Munn met with Major L. Lyne Dixson (a leading figure in British field sports) and the pair decided to find other supporters despite the fact that the General Strike of 1926 was looming.
The two men eventually met Brigadier-General Alfred Critchley, who in turn introduced them to Sir William Gentle JP. Eventually they raised £22,000 and formed a company called the Greyhound Racing Association Ltd, or GRA for short. When the GRA were deciding where to situate a new stadium they thought Manchester was an ideal place because of its sporting and gambling links. The company constructed the first custom-built greyhound stadium near the city centre and called it Belle Vue Stadium, where the very first race around an oval track in Britain was held on 24 July 1926 at 7.30 pm.
With over one million people unemployed and the first general strike in history taking place and troops had been deployed to trouble spots throughout Britain. Greyhound racing offered an affordable day out, away from all of the issues and as a result greyhound racing underwent remarkable growth over the next decade.
Only 1,700 people attended the first meeting at Belle Vue and they watched six races with seven dogs in each race. A greyhound called 'Mistley' won the first ever race over 440 yards, running the quarter-mile flat course in 25.00 seconds, Mistley romped home eight lengths clear at 6–1. Fifty years later a stand was named after Mistley.
Belle Vue ran many races with seven runners per race but after the formation of the National Greyhound Racing Club (NGRC) in 1928, the maximum number of dogs per race was limited to six, although this rule was to change several times during the century. The colours of the racing jackets that night were - trap 1-red, 2-blue, 3-white, 4-green, 5-black, 6-orange &amp; 7-red and white. Racing was very erratic compared to today because the greyhounds lining up were various mixes of former coursing hounds with no experience of oval racing except for a scattering of trials. Winning distances for the six races were 8, 1, 12, 10, 5 &amp; 2 lengths.
The GRA actually lost £50 on the first night because of the small attendance but the following week the crowds turned out in force; more than 16,000 people attended the meeting and within a short space of time "going to the dogs" became a national pastime. From the first meeting in July to the day the GRA closed for the winter break just three months later on 29 October, over 11,000 racegoers (per meeting) had paid to watch each of the 37 meetings. During those meetings there had been 221 races. The consortium repaid a £10,000 bank loan and shares in the new company rose from their initial value of one shilling to £37 10s. Two Belfast bookmakers called Joe Shaw and Hugh McAlinden visited Belle Vue during 1926 with the intention of gaining ideas to start track racing in Ireland.
The greyhounds themselves were generally supplied by coursing trainers, owners and breeders such as Sidney Orton, a Norfolk farmer who sold 17 greyhounds to Belle Vue for £170. A brindle greyhound called Mutton Cutlet, whelped in March 1921, had contested the Waterloo Cup in 1923, 1924 and 1925 and finished runner up in the Waterloo Plate in 1924. In 1926, he was brought by Tom Morris, keeper of the Irish Stud book. Morris put him to stud, demanding a fee of 10 guineas. Mutton Cutlet became the first major breeding sire (male parent) in track racing.

2018 Winter Paralympics Parade of Nations

During the 2018 Winter Paralympics Parade of Nations at the 2018 Winter Paralympics opening ceremony, beginning at 20:00 KST () on 9 March 2018, athletes bearing the flags of their respective nations led their national delegations as they paraded into the Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium in the host city of Pyeongchang, South Korea.
Background.
Athletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by Paralympic tradition. Greece entered first, while the host nation, South Korea, marched last. Other teams entered in alphabetical order based on the names of countries in the Korean language. The collation method used is based on the names as written in Hangul, the Korean alphabet. The names of the nations were announced English and Korean, the official languages of the Paralympic movement and the host nation, in accordance with traditional and International Paralympic Committee (IOC) guidelines.
Whilst most countries entered under their short names, a few entered under more formal or alternative names, sometimes due to political or naming disputes. North Korean and South Korean teams marched on their own, after the leaders of both Koreas failed to arrange for both teams to march together in the opening ceremony. After a Russian state-sponsored doping program was exposed following the 2014 Winter Paralympics, the Russian Paralympic Committee was suspended, and selected athletes were allowed to compete neutrally under the IOC designation of "Neutral Paralympic Athletes" (패럴림픽 중립 선수), under 중. In addition, the United States, Iran, North Korea, China and South Korea all entered under their formal names, respectively the "United States of America", "Islamic Republic of Iran", "Democratic People's Republic of Korea", "People's Republic of China" and "Republic of Korea".
A record of 49 nations entered the stadium with a combined total of 569 athletes. Three nations made their Winter Paralympic debut, namely Georgia, North Korea and Tajikistan.

Mystic Park

Mystic Park is a rural locality in the Australian state of Victoria. It straddles the Murray Valley Highway between Kerang and Swan Hill, and falls within the Shire of Gannawarra local government area. Mystic Park had a population of 181 people at the time of the 2016 Australian census.
Mystic Park contains Lake Tutchewop, part of the Kerang Wetlands, and also includes the northern and western shores of Kangaroo Lake (the lake itself falls within the Lake Charm locality). It also takes in the Tutchewop Wildlife Reserve, the Mystic Park Bushland Reserve, and part of the Koorangie Wildlife Reserve. Agriculture has historically been the main occupation in Mystic Park, although in recent years tourism has become more important – notably the Kangaroo Lake Caravan Park and the Mystic Park Vineyard (owned by Brown Brothers).
The origins of Mystic Park's name are unknown, but the locality takes its name from the Mystic Park Hotel, which was established in 1879 on the stagecoach run to Swan Hill. A station on the Piangil railway line was opened in 1890, and a township was gazetted in 1893. At one point, the locality supported a church, a school, a mechanics' institute, and a football club (which competed in the Kerang and District Football League).
John Gorton, the Prime Minister of Australia from 1968 to 1971, lived in Mystic Park for much of his life. His father, John Rose Gorton, headed a syndicate called Lake Kangaroo Estates, which bought land in the area in 1920 and developed citrus orchards. His son took over the management of the property in 1936.

The Hatton Garden Job

The Hatton Garden Job, also known as One Last Heist, is a 2017 British crime film. The film is a dramatization of real-life events in April 2015, when the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company, based underground in the Hatton Garden area of central London, was burgled by four elderly men, all experienced thieves. The film was directed by Ronnie Thompson and stars Larry Lamb, Matthew Goode, and Joely Richardson.
The film had its West End of London première at the Curzon, Shaftesbury Avenue, on 11 April 2017.
Synopsis.
Larry Lamb plays the 76-year-old Brian Reader, taking the lead among the four "codgers" who carry out the operation, with the title of Guvnor, while the other three at the sharp end of the raid are Danny Jones (Phil Daniels), Terry Perkins (David Calder), and Kenny Collins (Clive Russell). Apart from more routine thievery going back at least to his first conviction in 1975, Reader had previously laundered the proceeds of the Brink's-Mat robbery of 1983. The burglars enter the underground premises over an Easter bank holiday weekend through a lift shaft, then drill through the thick walls of the vault with an industrial power drill, proceeding over the following two days to rifle through dozens of deposit boxes. The burglar alarm goes off, but the police decide not to attend. The robbery remains undetected until staff return to work the following week, and newspapers are soon calling it the biggest theft in English history, as the total stolen has a reported value of up to £200 million — although the gang of seven (who have a combined age of 448) don't believe it.
Matthew Goode plays the organiser of the robbery, known only as XXX, while Joely Richardson is Erzebet Zslondos, a glamorous Hungarian mobster who is pulling the strings, complete with an exotic accent and remarkable set of costumes. A subplot centres on Zslondos and a corrupt policeman, DCI Frank Baskin (Mark Harris).
After an efficiently carried-out operation, the haul is divvied up, the Flying Squad of the Metropolitan Police ("the Sweeney") is called in, led by DCI Emma Carter (Sarah-Jane Crawford), and the insurers offer rewards for leads to crack the crime. Six weeks later, acting on information received, nine men are arrested, including Reader. Later, four other men are pulled in and charged with conspiracy to commit burglary. They then face the challenge of what (if anything) to say under questioning and the dilemma of whether to reveal the hiding places of the missing loot. Almost a year after they hit Hatton Garden, all but one of the men are found guilty and go to prison, Reader getting six years. Most do not take up the offer of shorter sentences for returning millions still unrecovered.
The leader, referred to in the film as "XXX", escapes justice — which at the time of shooting matched the story of the real-life Michael Seed (known as 'Basil'). Seed was later found guilty of both burglary and conspiracy to burgle, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the former and eight years for the latter, the two running concurrently.
Production.
It was announced on June 2016 that Larry Lamb, Matthew Goode, Joely Richardson, and Phil Daniels had taken leading roles in the low budget film.
Reception.
On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18% based on reviews from 17 critics, with an average rating of 3.90/10.
In negative reviews "The Guardian" called the film "a piece of geezer nostalgia" with a "wocka-wocka retro-funk score", but suggested that Phil Daniels might deserve an award for uttering the line “the biggest bling blag in history”. It also took the view that the film failed to keep faith with its grey power ethos by parachuting in an attractive young leader for the much older gang (Matthew Goode), who was simply an invention.
"The Daily Telegraph" deemed the film a Guy Ritchie pastiche and commented that "This is entirely, even aggressively un-cinematic, and after a while begins to feel like a bizarre, Brechtian joke at the audience’s expense: vast expanses of the film are, quite literally, just boring." "Metro"s review found the production slow and clichéd and suggested that "this is a film that ultimately proves to be every bit as opportunistic as the raid that initially inspired it."
The film magazine "Empire" was more positive,

Albert Reuss

Albert Reuss (2 October 1889 – 4 November 1975) was an Austrian-born British painter and sculptor. He was born in Vienna and fled to Britain in 1938 following the Anschluss, Adolf Hitler’s annexation of Austria to the German Reich. In the process, Reuss lost many members of his family, and the reputation he had built up as an artist in Vienna. He continued to work as an exiled artist, but his style changed dramatically, reflecting the trauma he had suffered. Several provincial galleries in England hold his work, most notably Newlyn Art Gallery in Cornwall, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere (the Belvedere Gallery) and the Albertina both in Vienna, and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel.
Life.
1889–1922: Early years in Vienna.
Albert Reuss was the son of Hungarian Jews, Ignaz Reisz (1855–1911) and Sidonia née Freund (1861–1928). Ignaz was a "Fleischhauermeister" and "Fleischhändler", a master butcher and meat trader. The couple at some stage moved to Malacky, in former Hungary, now Slovakia, where their first three sons were born. In the late 1880s, the family moved to Vienna, where Albert was born, followed by a further six children, three of whom died in infancy, leaving seven surviving children in all. The family name Reisz was changed by the Austrian authorities to Reiss.
From a young age, Albert became estranged from his family. A frail, sickly and vulnerable child, he seemed neither to fit into nor to belong to the family into which he was born. He suffered from ill-health and had considerable difficulties with social interaction throughout his life. He was introduced to the world of art by a rich uncle, Baron Andreas Ritter von Reisinger, who was married to his father's sister, and who appears to have instilled in the young boy a lifelong inferiority complex. Albert's artistic abilities emerged when he was only five years old, and at the age of 14, he applied, unsuccessfully, to the "Akademie der bildenden Künste Wien". Unable to pursue his dream of becoming an artist, he was obliged, on leaving school, to assist his father as a butcher. Given his delicate disposition and artistic sensibilities, working at the butchery was not an effective fit. There followed a series of equally unsuitable jobs, including salesman, childminder and actor, all of which ended in dismissal. These repeated experiences of rejection only added to his lack of self-worth. He became determined to teach himself by copying the Old Masters in the Belvedere Gallery and managed to gain several commissions for these paintings, as well as some commissions to paint portraits.
At the beginning of the First World War, he was obliged to undertake military service, but was allowed to do this in Vienna, due to his poor health, avoiding frontline duty. In 1915 he met his future wife, Rosa Feinstein (1891–1970), the daughter of Benjamin Feinstein, a merchant, and his wife Hinda née Prechner. Benjamin was born in Warsaw, Poland, which was at that time under the rule of Imperial Russia, making him and his family technically Russian. Rosa offered Albert the acceptance and encouragement he so desperately needed. Their marriage lasted for 55 years, and throughout that time she acted, in effect, as his agent and manager.
The couple were married in December 1916, but shortly after, Albert contracted tuberculosis and spent 18 months in a sanatorium. He took advantage of his confinement by drawing portraits of fellow patients, from which he began to establish a reputation as a portrait artist. Once he had recovered, the couple moved to an apartment at Möllwaldplatz 3, Vienna IV, where Albert established his studio, and in October 1922 they converted to Christianity. Also at this time, Albert started to use the surname "Reuss", though this change of name was not officially recognised until 1931. A young student, Sylvio Metzger, also moved into the apartment and developed a lifelong friendship with Albert and Rosa. A large body of correspondence between Sylvio and the couple has survived, and is stored, along with much other documentation, at "basis wien" in Vienna.
1922–1938: Artistic development.
During the 1920s, Reuss gradually established himself as an artist, working initially in portraiture, then developing an individual style of line drawing, which he called his linear work. In 1922, he exhibited a portrait at the Vienna Secession, (also known as "the Union of Austrian Artists"), and had his first solo exhibition at the Würthle Galerie in 1926. In 1930, a newspaper proprietor sponsored him to spend a year in Cannes, where he completed forty portraits and landscapes in oil, following which, he had a second solo exhibition at the Würthle Galerie in 1931. His exhibitions received good reviews in the Viennese press. Reuss subsequently became a member of the prestigious artists' association, the Hagenbund, with whom he exhibited on a number of occasions during the 1930s.
From 1926 to 1938, Reuss taught at the "Fachlehranstalt für das Kleidungsgewerbe" (The Specialist Teaching Institute for the Clothing Industry")". In 1934, he also started working as a sculptor, creating, among other things, portrait busts of the Viennese councillor Johann Grassinger and of the actress Maria Eis, as well as a study of his wife Rosa, now in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Throughout this period, the couple developed a middle-class lifestyle, and filled their flat in Vienna with numerous books, artefacts and artworks, including two works by Egon Schiele. Thus, by 1938, Reuss had become an established and relatively prosperous painter and sculptor in Vienna. However, this period coincided with the rise of Hitler and the Nazi Party, and by this time, it became clear that Albert and Rosa would have to flee their home country.
1938–1947: Flight from Vienna and first years in England.
Following the Anschluss, the annexation of Austria to the German Reich in March 1938, the Reusses packed up all their possessions, including Reuss's artworks, into 38 crates and left these in storage, but almost everything was confiscated by the Nazis. With the help of Cornishman and Quaker, John Sturge Stephens (1891–1954), they escaped from Vienna to England, where they arrived in Dover penniless and empty-handed in August 1938. They had with them 10 Reichsmark (equivalent at the time to about £1 sterling), the maximum cash allowed to emigrants by the German authorities. Some members of the Reiss family were not so fortunate: Albert's brother Julius and his family and his sister Ernestine and her husband Roman Torn were murdered in the Holocaust. Reuss's remaining siblings emigrated to the United States.
After a brief stay in London, the Reusses were invited by John Sturge Stephens to his cottage in St Mawes, the springboard of their future life in Cornwall. Now in their late forties, they were obliged to build a new life and career from scratch. This proved to be a struggle, despite the significant help and support they received from numerous benefactors. Two local female painters in St Mawes offered Reuss the use of their studio, and in October 1938, a first exhibition was held there, followed by another exhibition at Lanham's Gallery in St Ives, Cornwall in December 1938. A third exhibition took place in August 1939 in Truro, Cornwall. However, after England's declaration of war against Germany in September 1939, Reuss was briefly interned as an "enemy alien" in June 1940 at a detention centre in Shropshire, which greatly distressed him. Following his release in August 1940, Albert and Rosa moved to Cheltenham, where they remained for the next eight years. A fourth solo exhibition took place in 1940 in Cheltenham, followed by a fifth in 1944, Reuss having produced over 200 paintings in the corner of his small living room. He also obtained a job as an art teacher at "Dean Close School," an independent school in Cheltenham, which helped him to become more financially self-reliant, and to supplement his income as an artist. In 1947, Albert and Rosa Reuss were finally granted British nationality.
1948–1975: The Mousehole years.
In 1948, the Reusses moved to Mousehole, a fishing village in Cornwall, three miles beyond Penzance. Here they established the ARRA Gallery. Two flats (one to rent out), together with a studio and gallery, had been built for them by painter Ruth Adams (1893–1948), whom they had first met in 1938 at Lanham's Gallery in St Ives. Ruth was an ardent admirer of Reuss and was determined to bring her friends back to Cornwall, but she died in an accident just four weeks after their arrival, having left ARRA to the Reusses in her will. This inevitably caused gossip, and the entire episode was a most inauspicious way for Albert and Rosa to begin their new life in the village. Whereas they had been well accepted in St Mawes and Cheltenham, here they were largely to remain outsiders, despite a number of important new friendships. Much to his chagrin, Reuss's attempts to join the Penwith Society of Arts were unsuccessful, as is evident in correspondence with founding member Peter Lanyon. Nevertheless, now 60 years of age, Reuss continued to paint for the rest of his life, supported by the many friends and admirers he and Rosa had made over their first few years in England.
Whilst Albert painted, Rosa managed the ARRA Gallery together with their friend, Jeanne Day, and in collaboration with the Arts Council of Great Britain, hosting local artists such as Mousehole-born Jack Pender (1918–1998) and Alexander Mackenzie (1923 -2002) of the St Ives School. The gallery eventually closed in 1956. Between 1945 and 1956, Rosa also organised numerous solo exhibitions of her husband's work in municipal galleries throughout England, particularly in the North, where many galleries still hold his works.
From 1953, Reuss held regular one-man shows at the renowned O’Hana Gallery in London. Jacques O'Hana was an international art dealer specializing in the French Impressionists. He was a colourful, larger-than-life character, who became Reuss's friend and mentor for the next 20 years until O'Hana's death in 1974.
Once ARRA closed, and there were no further exhibitions in the provinces, the couple started to experience considerable financial difficulties. They managed to obtain compensation for victims of political persecution and a small pension from the Austrian Government. They received additional financial support from Reuss's younger brother, Max Reiss, with whom Albert had a difficult relationship.
Albert and Rosa's last few years were also plagued by ill-health, with repeated hospital stays for both of them. In January 1970, Rosa died. She had spent her entire life caring for and supporting her husband and ensuring that he remained in touch with the outside world. Albert was inconsolable, but struggled on alone for a further five years, still painting. He became concerned about his artistic heritage, fearing that his paintings could be destroyed after his death.
He entered into a lengthy correspondence with the Austrian Press Secretary and later Deputy Ambassador in London, Dr Ingo Mussi (1935–2012), who arranged, with Jacques O'Hana, for some of Reuss's works to be sent to international galleries in Vienna and Israel. Following O'Hana's death in 1974, almost 200 works, including paintings, sculptures and drawings, remained in the London gallery. Ingo Mussi arranged, with the permission of the dying artist, for these to be sent to Vienna to be curated by an organisation called "Euro Art". In September 1975, "Euro Art" hosted an exhibition held on the premises of the Bawag Foundation, which had been established in 1974. Bawag was a bank which had close ties with the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) and the Austrian Trade Union Federation (ÖGB). The bank actively sponsored the promotion of Austrian contemporary art and culture, and Albert Reuss's works were thus amongst the first to be exhibited by the Foundation, in full collaboration with the Socialist government of that time. The exhibition was called "Bilder der Einsamkeit – Albert Reuss" "(Pictures of Loneliness – Albert Reuss)", and was opened by the Education Minister Dr Fred Sinowatz, who was later to become Austrian Chancellor from 1983 to 1986. In his dying moments, Albert Reuss was finally able to experience success and recognition in his home country. He died on 4 November 1975 at the age of 86 years after a brief stay at a care home in Truro.
Reuss was a complex individual. A tall, slim, handsome man, he could often appear aloof, even arrogant. Despite his Viennese elegance, he sometimes behaved irrationally, for example he wrote a number of highly inappropriate letters to the very people who were trying to help him. Yet despite his eccentricities, and at times his unacceptable behaviour, he could also be most charming and had a remarkable capacity to draw people to him, even those he offended. He and Rosa were genuinely loved by a large number of people who were prepared to go to great lengths to help and support them.
Works.
During the early 1950s, when Reuss was exhibiting in galleries in the North of England, he occasionally gave talks in an attempt to explain his work. An article was published on 11 November 1951 (newspaper unknown) entitled "Artist Comes to ‘Explain’" where Reuss is quoted as having described three stages in the development of his art:
″Gateshead's Shipley Art Gallery ... includes pictures representing each of the three important stages through which Reuss's artistic life has passed from early pencil drawings, in which his striving after the essence of his subject was first observable, through the translation of this essence into oils, then to his later more uncompromising works.″
His earlier linear work of the 1920s was characterised by drawings which used a few brief pencil strokes to invoke recognisable images. This gave way to detailed and colourful oil paintings of landscapes, still lifes and figures, influenced by the expressionist Carinthian school of painting. This was a style he first developed during his period in Cannes, using a palette knife and “iridescent and opalescent colour”, for example "The Carinthian Family" "(Die Kärntner Familie)" (1932, private collection). This body of work was well received by the Viennese art critics of the 1930s, but following his exhibition in Vienna in 1975, his earlier work was described as "conventional", whilst he was thought to have "found himself" during his exile in England. Indeed, following his exile, there was an immediate change in Reuss's work into a style which could loosely be called Surrealism; his oil paintings now became simplified and muted with much cooler colours. Figures often looked sad or listless, or were portrayed with their backs turned. Compare for example "Woman Reading with Mother-In-Law's Tongue", a portrait of Rosa (1935, Newlyn Art Gallery) with "Woman Reading" (1942–1947, Newlyn Art Gallery). After moving to Mousehole in 1948, bleak landscapes started to appear, with broken fences and walls, and trees stripped of foliage. The art critics of the 1950s commented in particular on the beauty and simplicity of these paintings, the economy of line, and the artist's considerable draughtsmanship. Some also saw in Reuss's work a certain spiritual quality. In later years, Reuss's paintings became ever more desolate, and the figures started to disappear. Where figures were present, these looked abandoned, like flotsam on the beach. This is particularly evident in "Figure and Tree Stump" originally titled "Self-Portrait in the Open" (1967, Newlyn Art Gallery). Often random objects such as corrugated iron and boulders appeared in the landscape, and sometimes even penetrated into rooms, for example "Interior II" (1971/72, Newlyn Art Gallery).
An apt description of Reuss's post-Vienna work appears on the Kunsthandel Widder Gallery's websiteReuss’s artistic output is very much informed by his biography. Objects, floating relinquished through space and having lost any foothold, predominate his imagery… Ripped out of their natural context, those objects tell the story of a voyage, of a kind of abandonment of an object that does not fit in its new environment. In Reuss's artwork, style and choice of subject-matter invoke an association with Surrealism. Dali and Chirico are but the two most important artists [who] bring to mind Reuss's artwork. Reuss's depiction of people has a similarly estranged air about them as those of his objects. Taken out of context, of time, of place, the pictured people appear oddly strange. Melancholic and lonely, but also calm and gentle, Reuss's creations remind the viewer of the art of Josef Floch.There can be no doubt that these works were an expression of Reuss's mental state, of the extreme melancholy and despair that he had suffered throughout his life, but most especially the trauma he had experienced as a consequence of his exile, culminating in the "Pictures of Loneliness" of his final years.
Estate.
During the last few months of Reuss's life, Dr Mussi urged the ailing artist to appoint an heir, and to make it clear to whom he wished to leave his life's work. He suggested the possibility of leaving it to a public collection in Austria. Frail and confused, Reuss did not understand what was needed, and probably thought that by sending the bulk of his works to Vienna, he was doing just that. Consequently, there was no specific clause in his will naming an heir for his artistic works, though he was clear concerning his other assets, having written his will some years earlier with Rosa. All his artwork therefore went to the named residuary beneficiary, Miss Norette Reed, who had been a friend of Albert and Rosa for many years, and was an ardent admirer of Reuss's work. Norette was not expecting this gift, and in fact had donated her own collection of 31 Reuss paintings to the Newlyn Orion Gallery (now Newlyn Art Gallery) in June 1975, a few weeks before Reuss's death, specifying that this was to be kept as a permanent collection and not for sale. This became known as the "Norette Collection". She now inherited those paintings still remaining at ARRA, Reuss's studio and home in Mousehole, as well as those which had been transferred to Vienna. She was happy for the works in Vienna to remain there, as this had clearly been Reuss's wish, but resolved in June 1977 that she would also donate to the Newlyn Orion all the unsold works which she had inherited, both those in Vienna as well as those which had remained in England. However, in January 1979, Reuss's works still in Vienna were unexpectedly returned to Cornwall. John Halkes, the director at that time of the Newlyn Orion, was delighted with these new acquisitions, some of which were from Reuss's Vienna period. In an interview with Susan Soyinka, Reuss's biographer, in October 2016, he said: "I thought the sensible thing to do was to cream off some of the better ones and add them to the "Norette Collection" ... Meanwhile … we didn’t have storage ... so (the remainder) were steadily exhibited and sold over the years." The remaining works, available for sale, now became known as the Vienna Collection, which in later years was retitled the "Reuss Collection".
John Halkes was keen to honour Norette Reed's expressed wishes to raise Reuss's artistic profile and to ensure that a biography would be written. True to his word, he mounted several exhibitions during the 1970s and 1980s, not only at the Newlyn Orion but also at galleries in Plymouth and Bristol. In 1984, Halkes gave Reuss's written estate to a young German art student, Lioba Reddeker (1961–2011), who intended to write a biography, but was unable to complete this. Following her death, the entire documentation, including Lioba's research papers, was passed to ″basis wien″, a database of Austrian artists which she had founded.
Norette Reed died on 10 June 1991 and bequeathed one third of her residual estate to the Newlyn Orion. When John Halkes left the gallery in 1990, Reuss's works were put into storage and, apart from a further exhibition in 1992, were rarely seen for almost three decades.
The future of exile art.
In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the “lost generation” of emigrated artists, including Reuss, in Austria and Germany, and indeed there are a number of galleries in Vienna and Berlin which specialize in exiled artists. Reuss's work featured in two hugely successful exhibitions called "Die Uns Verliessen" "(The Ones Who Left Us)", held in Vienna in 1980, and "Art in Exile", held in 1986 in several venues in Europe, including London. More recently, his works have featured in the Leopold Museum in the 2007 exhibition "Zwischen den Kriegen. Österreichische Künstler 1918–1938 (Between the wars: Austrian artists 1918-1938"), in 2015 as part of "The Bigger Picture" at the Penlee House Gallery and Museum in Penzance, and in 2016 at the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, Israel. His work is also represented in Thomas B Schumann's large collection of exile art in Germany, and Herr Schumann used one of Reuss's paintings, "The Art Critic", on the cover of a book published in 2016, "Deutsche Künstler im Exil 1933 bis 1945", "(German Artists in Exile 1933 to 1945)".
Monica Bohm Duchen, the organiser of the 1986 "Art in Exile" exhibition, is in the process of organising a major national event called Insiders/Outsiders, an exciting nationwide arts festival planned for 2019 to celebrate the extraordinary contribution of refugees from Nazi Europe to British culture. There are plans to exhibit some of Reuss's work at a few galleries in Cornwall as part of this project.

Oh Se-hun (footballer)

Oh Se-hun (; born 15 January 1999) is a South Korean footballer, who plays as a forward for Ulsan Hyundai.
A towering center-forward, he is considered one of the most promising players of his generation in South Korea, regarding his finishing (both on headers and shoots), positioning, passing and ball possession, as well as his physical qualities.
Club career.
The beginnings and Ulsan Hyundai.
A graduate from Hyundai High School in Seoul, in 2018 he signed his first professional contract with K League 1 team Ulsan Hyundai. He was originally set to reinforce the youth squad of the "Horangi" in the national reserve league: however, on March 1, 2018, Ulsan's manager Kim Do-hoon caught everyone by surprise by giving Oh his senior debut at only 19 years old, as he chose him for the starting XI against Jeonbuk Hyundai Motors in the first game of the season. He played for 56 minutes before being replaced by Júnior Negrão, and his side eventually suffered a 2-0 away loss.
After making his continental debut in the AFC Champions League in April, coming in as a substitute for Cho Young-cheol in a 2-2 away draw against Kawasaki Frontale, throughout the year Oh went on to make other two brief appearances in K League 1, coming off the bench in two consecutive matches at the start of May, against Suwon Samsung Bluewings and Pohang Steelers.
Military service: Asan Mugunghwa and the Sangmu.
Approaching 2019, Oh decided to serve his compulsory military duty, so he could focus on his development as a player: as a result, he was loaned to Asan Mugunghwa, which at the time featured young players attending military service. He made his debut with the Police-owned team on March 2, 2019, playing the entirety of the 0-3 away win against Jeonnam Dragons and scoring his first senior goal at the 82th minute. Frequently featured in the starting XI through the whole K League 2 season, he concluded the year with 30 appearances (26 of which as a starter) and seven goals.
The following year, as Asan Mugunghwa was disbanded and replaced by civil team Chungnam Asan, Oh and several other players moved to the Army's main football team, Sangju Sangmu, which was set to play in the K League 1. He was given the number 18 shirt and made his debut for the Sangmu on June 13, 2020, in a home match against Pohang Steelers: although his side suffered a 4-2 loss, he scored both of Sangju's goals (one of which being a penalty). He featured regularly during the whole summer, scoring another couple of goals. However, on August 15, 2020 he suffered an injury against FC Seoul and got ruled out for a month.
Some weeks before, on August 2, during an away match against Gangwon, a collision between him and Jung Ji-yong during a header attempt left the latter with a concussion, causing him a loss of consciousness for some minutes: Oh, who got booked following the impact, was visibly shocked. Nevertheless, later on in the match he was able to assist Kim Bo-seob's temporary equalizer, and the teams ended up drawing 2-2. Luckily, Jung fully recovered from the accident and was soon able to get on the pitch again.
Oh returned on the pitch at the end of September, but suffered another injury just one week later, as the Sangmu lost 4-1 to his home team Ulsan. This forced him to miss the last three matches of the season. Even though bad luck kneecapped his season, Oh still managed to register 13 appearances (all as a starter) and four goals, contributing to the Sangmu's highest finish ever in the top-tier league, with the club obtaining a final fourth place despite of being destined to automatic relegation since the start of 2020, due to their planned re-location.
In 2021, Oh spent the last months of his military service in K League 2, as the Army's team moved to Gimcheon. He was given the number 9 shirt. He featured in four games, three of which as a starter, before exiting the squad as summer approached, in preparation to his return to Ulsan.
Return to Ulsan.
Right after he completed his military service and came back to Ulsan Hyundai, manager Hong Myung-bo included him in the list of players that would travel to the centralized venue in Bangkok and take part in the group stage matches of the AFC Champions League throughout June and July 2021.
Mainly used as a back-up striker for Lukas Hinterseer and Kim Ji-Hyeon, he registered his first appearance for Ulsan after almost three years on June 26, 2021, when he came on as a substitute and assisted the only goal of the match (scored by Hinterseer) against Viettel. He also started against Kaya-Iloilo on July 2, scoring a brace as his side obtained a 3-0 win.
International career.
He represented South Korea at several youth levels.
In 2015, he was selected by head coach Choi Jin-cheul to take part in the FIFA U-17 World Cup in Chile. Being one of the youngest members of the squad, he was used a substitute, but still managed to leave his mark in the competition: coming in for Lee Seung-woo in the injury time of the group stage match against Guinea, he scored the winner just one minute since he had got on the pitch, as he sent the ball in the top corner of the net after being assisted by You Ju-an. Oh's goal was eventually included in FIFA's Top 10 list of the tournament's best goals. South Korea was eventually eliminated from the World Cup in the round of 16, following a 2-0 loss against Belgium.
In 2018, he took part both in the Toulon Tournament, where the South Korean selection was eliminated in the group stage, and the AFC Under-19 Championship, where his side reached the final before losing 1-2 to eventual winners Saudi Arabia.
In 2019, he was selected by head coach Chung Jung-yong to take part in the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Poland, being the only player in South Korea's 21-men list who was serving his military duty. Except for the debut in the group stage against Portugal, Oh started every single match of his side, scoring two consecutive headers, against Argentina and Japan (in the round of 16), and one penalty in South Korea's successful shoot-out against Senegal in the quarter-finals. As a result, he played a considerable role in the "Taeguk Warriors"' road to the tournament's final, then lost to Ukraine with the score of 3-1.
In 2020, he was selected by head coach Kim Hak-bum to be part of the squad that would participate in the AFC U-23 Championship in Thailand. Used frequently during the tournament, he scored a brace in South Korea's 2-1 win against Uzbekistan in the last game of the group stage, thus getting involved in the "Taeguk Warriors"' first victory of the competition, as they beat Saudi Arabia after the extra-time in the final and qualified for the Olympics.
Personal life.
He's similarly as tall as his father, while his mother is a former handball player. From a sports-related point of view, his main role model is fellow South Korean and forward Kim Shin-wook, with whom Oh has been likened due to similar physical structure and aerial ability.
He went to the same high school as Choi Jun: the two have been team-mates and have represented South Korea at a youth international level for years.
He's probably religious: sometimes, he can be seen reciting a prayer at the end of a match.

Artur Danielian

Artur Ashotovich Danielian (, born 17 December 2003) is a Russian figure skater. He is the 2020 European silver medalist, the 2020 Russian national silver medalist, and the 2018 World Junior silver medalist.
Personal life.
Danielian was born on 17 December 2003 in Volgograd, Russia. He is the youngest of three children. He is of Armenian descent.
Career.
Early years.
Danielian began learning to skate in 2008, after an ice rink opened near his home in Volgograd. In 2016, he moved to Moscow and joined CSKA Moscow. Marina Selitskaia and Elena Buianova became his coaches.
2017–2018 season.
In September 2017, Danielian competed at his first Junior Grand Prix (JGP) assignment, placing seventh in Zagreb, Croatia. In February 2018, he won the bronze medal at the 2018 Russian Junior Championships.
In March, Danielian competed at the 2018 World Junior Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria. He won the silver medal, behind teammate Alexey Erokhov, after placing eighth in the short program and second in the free skate.
2018–2019 season.
Danielian started his season by competing in the 2018 JGP series. At his first JGP event of the season he placed fifth in Ljubljana, Slovenia. At his second JGP event he placed fourth in Yerevan, Armenia. Danielian next competed at the 2018 Tallinn Trophy, where he won a gold medal.
Though only fifth at the 2019 Russian Junior Championships, Danielian was nevertheless sent to the 2019 World Junior Championships. This happened because junior champion Daniil Samsonov was not age-eligible to compete internationally and fourth-place finisher Erokhov subsequently withdrew. At the Junior Worlds Danielian placed ninth in the short program, fifth in the free skating and fourth overall, with a new personal best score of 220.68 points. 
2019–2020 season.
Competing on the Junior Grand Prix, Danielian won silver medals at both JGP Russia and JGP Croatia, ending up as first alternate to the Junior Grand Prix Final. Making his senior international debut on the Challenger series at 2019 CS Golden Spin of Zagreb, he placed fourth.
Competing at the 2020 Russian Championships at the senior level for the first time, Danielian was only thirteenth in the short program, but skated a clean free program, winning that segment outright amidst rough performances from those who placed ahead in the short program. As a result, he rose to the silver medal position. 
Danielian's performance earned him a berth at the 2020 European Championships, where he placed third in the short program despite stepping out of his triple Axel. Though he placed fourth in the free skate, he won the silver medal overall.
Danielan was assigned to compete at the 2020 World Championships in Montreal, but these were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
2020–2021 season.
An ankle injury forced Danielian to withdraw from the senior Russian test skates. Danielian was scheduled to make his Grand Prix debut at the 2020 Rostelecom Cup, but withdrew due to his surgical recovery. He subsequently withdrew from the Russian Championships for the same reason.

Henrietta Bentinck, Duchess of Portland

Henrietta Bentinck, Duchess of Portland (1774 – 24 April 1844), formerly Henrietta Scott, was the wife of William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland.
Henrietta was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was the eldest daughter and the heiress of Major-General John Scott of Fife and his second wife, the former Margaret Dundas. Prior to her marriage, she was sometimes referred to as "the rich Miss Scott", to differentiate her from her two younger sisters.
Henrietta married the future duke in London on 4 August 1795, when he was styled Marquess of Titchfield. The marquess obtained Royal Licence to take the name and arms of Scott in addition to that of Cavendish-Bentinck. They had nine children:
The marquess inherited his father's dukedom in 1809, and Henrietta became Duchess of Portland. Their family home was Welbeck Abbey, Nottinghamshire, where the duke kept racehorses and carried out extensive irrigation works.
Two of the couple's sons predeceased their parents: the Marquess of Titchfield died of a brain lesion, aged 27, and Lord George Bentinck of a heart attack. The duchess predeceased her husband, who died at Welbeck Abbey in March 1854, aged 85.

George Cadle

George Ancil Cadle (May 9, 1948 – March 15, 2015) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1970s and 1980s.
Born in Middlesboro, Kentucky, Cadle was a graduate of Middlesboro High School and the University of Tennessee. As an amateur golfer, Cadle won the Kentucky State Amateur tournament three times, in 1966, 1967 and 1969, playing on three different Bluegrass State courses.
He made his PGA Tour debut in 1974 at the Bob Hope Desert Classic and joined the tour full-time a year later. His best finish in the 1970s was a tie for third at the 1979 Greater Hartford Open. He would record the second and final third-place finish of his career a year later at the 1980 Greater Milwaukee Open. In 1980 he would also finish 57th on the money list, making $75,265, his best placing ever. 
The best finish of his career was again at the 1983 Greater Milwaukee Open. Cadle shot a final-round, 8-under-par 64 - including four birdies in his final six holes - to force a sudden-death playoff, which he lost to Morris Hatalsky on the second hole.
In 1990, he played in 11 tournaments during the inaugural season of the developmental Ben Hogan Tour. His best result was an 11th-place showing at the New Haven Open. The following year he made his final PGA Tour appearance.
His golfing nickname was "Cuddles."

Kammermohr

Kammermohr (or "Hofmohr"; pl. "Kammermohren") was a German-speaking term since the 18th century for a court servant of black skin colour, which had by that time long been a common feature in European courts. 
History.
People of black skin colour from the Orient, Africa and America have often been taken to Europe as valets during the time of Colonialism. This became common in the 16th-century and continued to be fashionable until the early 19th-century. The term "Kammermohr" was first used as an official term in a court protocol in 1747 in Saxon. 
The splendidly decorated Kammermohr, often in livery, served a ruler, church dignitaries or wealthy merchants as an exotic object of prestige and as a status symbol, showcasing their wealth and luxury lifestyle. Above all, however, the valets symbolized the worldwide relations of their employer.

Rupa Bai Furdoonji

Rupa Bai Furdoonji, born to a Parsi family, was the world's first female anesthetist. She practiced medicine in Hyderabad, and played a major role in introducing the use of chloroform as an anesthetic in India.
Early life and career.
In 1885, Furdoonji began her studies and was one of five women to enroll in medical courses at Hyderabad Medical College. In 1889, she obtained a degree of "Hakeem", equivalent to that of a Medical Doctor. Subsequently, she pursued a medical degree from Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore. In 1909, with the encouragement from Annie Besant, Furdoonji went to Edinburgh, Scotland to gain more experience and knowledge in anesthetics. There, she obtained diplomas in Physics and Chemistry from The University of Edinburgh since no specialized course emphasized anesthetics. She chose to study Physics and Chemistry because the knowledge of these subjects was found useful for the doctors who handled anesthetics.
Furdoonji was an influential voice at the First and Second Hyderabad Chloroform Commissions held in 1888 and 1891 respectively. From 1889-1917 She had administered anaesthesia in the British residency hospital-(present Sultan Bazaar hospital), Afzalgunz Hospital-(present Osmania General Hospital) and Victoria Zenana Maternity Hospital, Hyderabad. In 1920, she retired as the superintendent of Chaderghat Hospital, Hyderabad.

Frank Fowler Loomis

Frank Fowler Loomis (April 2, 1854 – September 19, 1936) was a nineteenth-century American businessman, blacksmith, fireman, engineer and electrician. He was a key manager and director in improving and developing the fire and police departments for the city of Akron, Ohio. Loomis was known for innovating new state of the art electrical-mechanical devices. He developed new style police and fire alarm systems for Akron. He designed and developed the world's first motorized police patrol wagon ("paddy wagon"). This vehicle was an exhibit in the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition. His electrical innovations and inventions were duplicated and put into use by other major cities in the United States. He established the "Loomis Award" for fire service valor and heroism.
Early life.
Loomis was born in Akron to Joseph and Elizabeth (née Taylor) Loomis on April 2, 1854. His father died when he was eight years old in 1862 so he then lived with an uncle at Wadsworth, Ohio, for the next seven years. Loomis attended the local Akron public schools when he grew up as a child. In early 1869, he worked on the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal for a few months. Later that year he went to work at Merrill's pottery workshop for a while and after that took up the blacksmith's trade.
Mid life and career.
Loomis became a volunteer fireman in Akron's fire department in 1870. He slept at night at the fire station for potential fires and worked at his outside trade as a blacksmith during the day. His first assignment at the fire department was as a "call man" and would holler as an alarm to get volunteers during a fire. He became a paid fireman at Steamer No. 1 fire station in January 1871 when the current engineer had died.
In 1874, Loomis and a city mechanical engineer by the name of James H. Stanford built four fire alarm telegraph signal boxes at key businesses in Akron. These were located in the city at the Empire hotel, Buckeye Mower &amp; Reaper works, Diamond Match factory, and the old Akron Iron company. It was soon realized that more alarm boxes were needed. The city, however, would not finance this needed improvement. Loomis, the other engineer, and the fire chief bought wire then from a defunct telegraph line to make these upgrade improvements. They wired fifteen miles in Akron to install additional new alarm boxes.
The system first used a telegraph key, but it was realized that the person that operated the key during the emergency could not give the correct signal during the hysteria of a new fire. Loomis then developed an alarm box that worked by turning a crank automatically when the door was opened, giving the correct signal. He patented the alarm box which sent this signal automatically.
The success of the fire alarm system spawned a similar system for the police department that was installed in 1885. Loomis designed an alarm box for police patrolmen requesting a wagon, additional policemen, or required firemen. It was first developed with a telegraph key before a new alarm box style with a pre-installed telephone replaced it. Loomis was promoted to the city's Chief Engineer in 1890 and held that position for 27 years.
Police patrol wagon.
In the late 1890s, Loomis started developing a horseless wagon for the police department. His invention in 1899 became the first motorized police patrol wagon in the world. The Collins Buggy Company built the carriage weighing that cost $2,400. The police patrol is sometimes referred to as a "paddy wagon." Visitors came from all over the United States to inspect the vehicle and duplicates were made for the police departments of Cleveland, Chicago, and New York City.
The motorized police patrol wagon was an electric vehicle that weighed as a complete unit almost three tons. It came with an alarm gong to alert people it was coming. The police patrol vehicle had a headlight for use after sunset and had a stretcher so it could be used as an ambulance. It had three speeds and could go up to . The carriage body of the wagon was built in 1899 by the Collins Buggy Company of Akron to specifications and drawings of Loomis.
The wagon had a seating capacity of twelve people and ran with two 4-horsepower electric motors. The storage batteries of the police wagon had to be charged every thirty miles. It was less expensive to maintain than a team of horses to pull a wagon to do the equivalent work. A special building was constructed to house the unique electric police wagon which consisted of a modern chief's office station. Akron patrolman John Dunkin made the first arrest with the police horseless transport automobile in 1899.
The electric carriage was taken by a mob in the 1900 Akron riot before being damaged and dumped into the Ohio &amp; Erie Canal. It was recovered, repaired, and put into service for an additional seven years. The electric patrol wagon had done 226 police runs by 1901 and had traveled 200 miles in the process of escorting criminals to jail. It was in the Akron police force through 1907, traveling some all total in its service. It was then sold out in 1908 as scrap for $25.
Loomis's vehicle was completely overhauled in 1913 by the Selle Company who purchased it in preparation for exhibition in the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. The historical car of wooden wheels and solid rubber tires was a display of the International Expo. In 1917, the Selle Company who had originally supplied the vehicle's gears, dismantled it into parts that were used elsewhere.
Personal life.
Loomis married Barbara Grad of Akron on July 10, 1879. He retired from the Akron fire department in 1910. He died September 19, 1936. Loomis established by his will the "Loomis Award" for fire service valor and heroism. In the first 50 years of its existence only three firefighters received the award.

Striped flying squid

Eucleoteuthis is a monotypic genus of squid from the family Ommastrephidae; the only species is Eucleoteuthis luminosa, the striped flying squid or luminous flying squid.
Description.
The striped flying squid is a very distinctive species which has two long, yellowish luminous stripes on the underside of its mantle surface and a fused apparatus for locking the funnel to the mantle. It grows to a mantle length of roughly 220 mm and the maximum mantle length recorded in males is 207 mm while the females are slightly longer at 227 mm. Its fourth left arm is hectocotylized and has 19–22 suckers in two series in its basal two-thirds where there is a weak protective membrane and there are two pointed knobs rather than suckers on its tip where the ventral protective membrane is more developed than that on the dorsal side. The largest suckers on the tentacular clubs have either a smooth margin or a single large tooth. The smaller suckers may have more teeth. The apparatus for locking the funnel organ to the mantel is forked towards the front and is fused to the rear, but only in individuals who have a mantle length over 9 mm. There are small subcutaneous photophores on the underside of mantle, head and of the third and fourth arms, while the fourth arms have a large oval photophore at their bases and another hallway to their tips. The ventral surface of mantle has two stripes of luminous tissue extending along almost its entire length with two large, oval-shaped luminous patches at the end of each mantle strip closest to the head. The fins are heart-shaped and taper to a point. The larvae have dispersed large brown chromatophores while in the juveniles these are crimson and brown.
The species is bioluminescent.
Distribution.
The striped flying squid is distributed in the southern oceans and in the North Pacific Ocean but it is absent from the North Atlantic Ocean. In the southern South Pacific it is occurs between 20°S and 35°S in the west and it is found from 13°S to 43°S in the east; in the southern Indian Ocean it occurs north to 15°S and south to 34°S and in the southern South Atlantic Ocean between 10°S and 36°S. In the North Pacific Ocean it occurs from the southern Kuril Islands to western North America as far south as Mexico, between 10°N to 40°N.
Habitat and biology.
The striped flying squid is found in the epipelagic and upper mesopelagic zones, occurring from near the surface to a depth of 400 m. It lives in open waters mostly over depths of over , and it appears to be nektonic rather than benthic. Subadults and adults have been recorded at the surface at night, but only rarely. They spend the day at depths greater than 50 to . They are low to moderately abundant; they are most numerous in the South Pacific Ocean between 30°S and 40°S. Males reach maturity at 95 to 185 mm mantle length, normally at age 180 to 270 days, and females mature at 102 to 200 mm mantle length when they are aged 220 to 240 days. This varies widely over the squid's range and they grow larger at lower latitudes. The maximum life span is one year. In the lower latitudes they spawn throughout the year but in the higher latitudes it is restricted to the spring and summer. The male's spermatophores are 11.2 to 15.8 mm in length, in the Needham's sac of mature males there may be up to 150 of them although more usually between 70 and 100 are present. The egg size is 0.8 to 1.0 mm, and each female may have between 300,000 and 625,000 ova, with the oviducts of mature females holding about 17 000 ripe eggs, probably more.

Kollam Orthodox Diocese

The Kollam Orthodox Diocese, one of the 30 dioceses of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, was created after the Mulanthuruthy Synod in 1876. Zachariah Mar Anthonios is the metropolitan bishop of the diocese, whose head office is in Bishop House, Cross Junction, Kadappakada, Kollam, Kerala, India.
History.
Kollam is an ancient commercial center and seaport. According to tradition, Thomas the Apostle arrived in the city and founded a church which is now underwater. Kollam is one of the seven dioceses created after the Mulanthuruthi Syrian Christian Association (synod) of 1876, led by Patriarch of Antioch Ignatius Peter IV; the other dioceses are Kottayam, Kandanadu, Angamali, Niranam, Thumpamon, and Kochi. Originally, there were over 30 churches in the diocese. Dionysious V was its first metropolitan bishop. He was succeeded by Geevarghese Gregorios of Parumala, who also led the Niranam diocese. Vattasserril Geevarghese, Geevarghese II (when the diocese's head office was in the Kundara seminary), Alexios Mar Thevodosios of Bethany (who became metropolitan in 1938), Mathews I, and Mathews II followed.
Mathews I moved the diocese's head office from Kottappuram Seminary in Kottarakkara to Cross Junction, near Kadappakada, where the bishop's house ("aramana") and St. Thomas Orthodox Syrian Cathedral were built. Mathews II was appointed assistant metropolitan in 1985, and became metropolitan in 1991; the following year, there were 130 parishes and 13 churches. After his death, Didymos I became the diocese's eighth metropolitan. The Thiruvananthapuram Orthodox Diocese was created from the Kollam diocese in 1979, and the Adoor Kadampanad and Kottarakkara Punalur Orthodox Dioceses were created from the Thiruvananthapuram diocese in 2010.
Major churches.
The diocese has 64 parishes. The Kadeesha Syrian Church in Port Kollam, the tomb of Mar Abo in Thevalakkara, St. Mary's Orthodox Syrian Church in West Kallada, and St. Thomas Orthodox Syrian Church in Kundara are its oldest religious buildings. Kundara Seminary, the Nedumpaikulam St. George Orthodox Syrian Church, and the Nallila Bethel St. George Orthodox Syrian Church are other churches.

Pulcherada Abbey

The Church of Saint Mary of Pulcherada (), most commonly known as Pulcherada Abbey () was an abbey now serving as a Roman Catholic church located in San Mauro Torinese near Turin, Italy.
History.
The abbey began to be built between the 6th and 8th century AD on what used to be a Roman encampment. The first section to be built was the apse, and the main building was completed between 1029 and 1031. The bell tower was built within the next 200 years, and was built to be disproportionally taller than the rest of the building, which suggests it might have had defense purposes. The abbey became a center around which a village would start to form and eventually grow to become what is now the comune of San Mauro Torinese.
Before the 17th century, the abbey took up the terrain of what are currently the city hall and the church. The abbey contained gardens, fields for cultivation, a mill, a bakery, and a variety of artisanal workshops. In 1665, because of decay, abbot Petrino Aghemio chose to demolish a large portion of the complex, greatly reducing the size of the abbey. In 1803, the few monks present moved to the nearby abbey of San Quintino di Spigno, and thus Pulcherada Abbey was officially closed down the same year by order of Pope Pius VII. Since then, the former abbey has been used exclusively as a church.

Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens

The Fédération International des Véhicules Anciens or FIVA (English: international federation of ancient vehicles) is the worldwide federative association of historic automobile clubs, be they for veteran, vintage, pre- or post-war classic cars, at least thirty years old.&lt;br&gt;
FIVA statutes define it as: "a non-profit international association of clubs, federations and other organisations concerned with the preservation, restoration, use and culture of mechanically propelled road vehicles." 
FIVA member clubs represent more than 1.5 million oldtimer enthusiasts in 64 countries, through more than 85 member organizations.
The FIVA's executive board bestows so-called ANF-Status ("Autorité Nationale de la FIVA"), or national FIVA authoritative status, upon one member organization per country, with the American Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) as the designated North American representative of FIVA – both for the U.S. and Canada.
In 2013 all 61 national member organizations of FIVA ratified and enacted the so-called "Turin Charter", set forth by The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage (TICCIH) "to preserve and safeguard the history of vehicles including their engineering, form, functions and documented histories and their many and diverse relationships with society and social environments, .." 
Founding and objectives.
The “Fédération Internationale des Véhicules Anciens” was founded in 1966, when several historic vehicle associations and classic car clubs in a number of different countries felt a need for a worldwide body to promote and direct the interests of a historic vehicle movement internationally.
FIVA's primary objective was to: "encourage the safe use of self-propelled, mechanical vehicles, more than thirty years old, on the roads for the benefit of both their owners, dedicated enthusiasts and the general public." 
The FIVA's three main goals and objectives include:
Methods, activities and collaborations.
FIVA's "Culture Commission" works to achieve recognition of historic vehicles and related objects, as culturally significant artifacts, by legal and political authorities and other stakeholders. FIVA's "Events Commission" collaborated with the European Commission to create a freely downloadable Driver's Code for general guidance of historic vehicle users, and also has devised a code for the safe promotion of rallies or mildly competitive events. The "Technical Commission" works to support the preservation of as many historic vehicles as possible, by cataloguing them with FIVA's "Vehicle ID-card". FIVA has forged links with UNESCO and has persuaded the European Commission to accept that historic vehicles represent an important part of industrial heritage. FIVA has further linked up with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to promote the interest of historic cars in more sporting arenas, and with the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM), to help achieve similar objectives for motorcycles. FIVA's "Legislation Commission" works to address legislation that (threatens to) limit(s) the continued use of historic vehicles. Sofar this has primarily been concentrated on European countries and the European Union, but legislation pressures on motor transport are ever increasing generally.
Commissions.
FIVA has Ambassadors, and a number of dedicated commissions working on its (members') national and international goals:

Guinean Market Women's Revolt

The Market Women's Revolt of 1977 was a series of large demonstrations and riots across Guinea brought about by the imposition of government-set prices for goods sold in the country's public markets.
The riots began on 27 August 1977 when women vendors in Conakry's Medina Market began rioting against the "economic police," who were responsible for enforcing the government's price controls and were often corrupt. The riots spread throughout the country and led to several deaths.
The revolt is seen as a major turning point in the history of Guinea and the end of President Ahmed Sékou Touré's most radical economic reforms. 27 August became a public holiday following the end of President Ahmed Sékou Touré's regime although it was suspended by Lansana Conté's government in 2006, shortly before an uprising sparked by the price of rice took place.

J.S. Anna Liddiard

J.S. Anna Liddiard (29 April 1773 – October 1819) was an Irish romantic poet whose work draws on themes of patriotism, Irish culture and history, landscape, and human relations.
Life.
Jane Susannah Anna Wilkinson was born in County Meath. She was the daughter of Sir Henry Wilkinson, of Corballis. She married Rev. William Liddiard (1773–1841) on 12 February 1798, an Anglican clergyman of Wiltshire who was a poet, artist and retired army officer. He was the vicar of Culmullen, Co. Meath from 1807-1810, and then in the united parish of Knockmark from 1810-1831. Liddiard had one son, Henry Liddiard, born in 1800. He inherited the rectory of Knockmark. Liddiard's death date is not officially recorded, but she appears to predeceased her husband, as he remarried in 1822. She appears to have died at Corballis, with "The Bristol Mercury" reported her death as 30 October.
Poetry and writing.
Liddiard dedicated her book of "Poems" to her husband, published in Dublin in 1809. The couple moved to Bath in 1811, living there for 2 years. Whilst there she published "The Sgelaighe" or "A tale of old" in 1811, supposedly drawing on an old Irish manuscript. She describes her return from Bath to Ireland in "Kenilworth and Farley Castle" (1813). This book is addressed to the Ladies of Llangollen, whom she visited. In 1816, she published a tale in verse called "Evening after the battle", which was published along with her husband's "Mont St Jean", both pieces are based around the battle of Waterloo. An anonymous work "Mount Leinster" (1819) is usually ascribed to Liddiard, but could have been written by her husband.
Liddiard's verse is patriotic and romantic, in particular her poem "Addressed to Albion" and "Conrade". Both Liddiard and her husband advocated for religious tolerance, with the work "Mount Leinster" blaming the 1798 Rebellion on the Penal Laws.

Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2)

Imaginary Landscape No. 4 (March No. 2) is a composition for 24 performers on 12 radios and conductor by American composer John Cage and the fourth in the series of "Imaginary Landscapes". It is the first installment not to include any percussion instrument at all and Cage's first composition to be based fully on chance operations. It is also the second march in the set of "Imaginary Landscapes", after "Imaginary Landscape No. 2 (March No. 1)". It was composed in 1951.
Composition.
As Cage's compositional style developed, he found that, in order to circumvent the listener's wish to find any emotional appeal to music, the composer himself had to detach from his own work and should not have any control on the composition, that is, he had to remove any personal trait that identifies him as a composer. At this time, in 1951, he was also working with his "Music of Changes", which was another great step towards chance operations in composition. The first performance of this composition took place at the McMillin Theater at Columbia University, New York, with Cage himself conducting, on May 2, 1951.
The first performance was marked by its low dynamic level (partly due to the fact that the performers were using portable radios), clear distinction of sound events and a thin texture, which was seen as a flaw by the audience. Moreover, the late hour at which it was performed meant that the radios would not pick up much non-static sound, as most radio stations were no longer broadcasting during the night. However, according to Cage himself, the "Imaginary Landscape No. 4" "was certainly not a rabble-rouser". This was not Cage's last composition to include radios, as he also did it in Speech 1955, Radio Music and Music Walk.
In reference to this, he commented: "It is thus possible to make a musical composition the continuity of which is free of individual taste and memory (psychology) and also of the literature and 'traditions' of the art. The sounds enter the time-space ... centered within themselves, unimpeded by service to abstraction". It was dedicated to Morton Feldman and was published by Edition Peters.
Structure.
This piece consists of only one movement and the average duration for it is 4 minutes. It is scored for 12 radios, each radio calling for two performers, and a conductor. Its score looks like a conventional score, with the slight difference that here a half inch equals a quarter note. However, accelerandos and ritardandos are also present in the score. It is prefaced by an extensive explanation on the indication of durations, station tunings, dynamics (numbers ranging from 3 to 15, 3 being turned on but inaudible, 15 being maximum volume). According to Cage, all of these performance parameters were determined by chance operations, rather than conscious decisions.
Each radio requires two performers to use it: one for tuning and the other for the amplitude and timbre changes. This way, what is being publicly broadcast at the time and place of the performance becomes the sonic material of the music, which can be anything, from music and talk to white noise between stations. As in the case of "Imaginary Landscape No. 2 (March No. 1)", this is no conventional march and has no traits that would identify it as such. To Cage, who was not particularly fond of radios, this was not a piece to be listened to, but rather an exercise in abandoning preferences, erasing all will from the piece and, therefore, the very idea of success.

The a.r. group ("revolutionary artists" or "real avant-garde") was an avant-garde art group set up by Władysław Strzemiński, Katarzyna Kobro, and Henryk Stażewski in 1929.
Rather than creating its own magazine the a.r. group issued short irregular bulletins, the first in March 1930, followed by a second in December 1932. They also published a series of avant-garde books, which formed the a.r. collection. Nevertheless, through the a.r. group, Strzemiński was able to set up the first International Collection of Modern Art in Europe, based in Łódź.

Party Girl (1930 film)

Party Girl is a 1930 American pre-Code crime film directed by Victor Halperin and starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Jeanette Loff, and Marie Prevost. It is also known by the alternative title of Dangerous Business, the title of the novel on which it is based. It follows a New York businessman who inadvertently becomes involved in the criminal activities of a covert escort agency.
The film holds the record for the longest transfer from banned status to original release in United Kingdom history, having been rejected for cinema release in 1930, and remaining unreleased there until 2003.
Plot.
Maude Lindsay operates the Lindsay Social Bureau, which is a covert front for a "party girl" escort agency that caters to high-class playboys attempting to close business deals. Jay Rountree, the son of a bottle manufacturer, is engaged to marry his secretary, Ellen Powell, a former party girl, whose roommate, Diana Hoster, secretly works as a party girl.
Around Christmas time, Jay and his friends crash one of the girls' parties, where he meets Leeda Cather, the daughter of a formerly-prominent New York family who has gone destitute. A drunken Jay spends the night with Leeda, awaking in her room the next morning, where she exclaims that he "ruined her" the previous night. When Leeda's "mother" confronts the two in bed, Leeda claims she eloped with Jay the night before, a story which he goes along with. Leeda then suggests to Jay that the two marry that afternoon.
When news of their elopement makes the papers, Leeda calls her ex-fiancé Paul Newcast, a businessman who was hesitant to marry her. Happy to be free of the obligation, he gives Jay's father a business contract, as well as sending Leeda $5,000. Jay overhears the conversation and confronts her, but she insists the marriage benefits him and his father's business. At a Christmas Eve dinner at his family's home, Jay tells his father about Leeda's deception, after which she states she pressured Paul into signing the contract, and threatens to implicate Jay and his father in a public scandal.
Meanwhile, Ellen learns of Jay and Leeda's relationship, and is persuaded to attend one of Maude's parties. Police subsequently arrive at Leeda's apartment to investigate the party girl racket, and make a deal with her if she cooperates with the investigation. Leeda attempts to flee via a fire escape, and falls several stories. Jay arrives just before Leeda dies, and she remorsefully instructs him to save Ellen from the party being raided by police. Jay manages to arrive at the party just before the police and explains to them that he and Ellen are not involved in the party girl racket. Maude attempts to convince the police that Ellen is in fact a party girl, but her secretary, Miss Manning, attests that Ellen has never worked for her. After the police depart, Jay proposes to Ellen and she accepts.
Production.
During the production of the film, actor Paul Bern dated Loff, Barrie, and Prevost, the film's three principal female stars.
Release.
"Party Girl" premiered in New York City on New Year's Day 1930, expanding on January 25. Due to its themes surrounding sexuality, the film was banned in some U.S. cities, such as Birmingham, Alabama.
Home media.
Alpha Video released "Party Girl" on DVD on April 25, 2006.

Mary Hearn

Mary Ellice Thorn Hearn M.D. F.R.C.P.I. (1891–1969) was a gynaecologist and first female fellow of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.
Early life and education.
Hearn was born on 25 February 1891 to William Edward Ashley Cummins (1858–1923), Professor of Medicine at University College Cork, and Jane Constable Cummins (née Hall) in Cork. They had five daughters and six sons. Geraldine Cummins was a playwright. Jane Cummins was a squadron officer in the WRAF during the second world war and became a medical doctor. Iris Cummins was an engineer. Two of her brothers also became doctors, and one, N. Marshall Cummins, was involved in setting up the first blood transfusion service in Cork.
Education.
Hearn began to study medicine in UCC, however she left in 1911 to get married. With the encouragement of her husband, she returned to UCC, and graduated with an MB, B.Ch., BAO in 1919 with first-class honours and a distinction in medicine despite having had her son who also attended her conferring ceremony. Hearn went on to gain her MD in 1922, when she was awarded first place and a special distinction in the examination.
Work.
Hearn worked as house surgeon and house physician for the Cork North Infirmary in Cork until 1922 when she was appointed to the Victoria Hospital Cork in 1922 as an honorary anaesthetist. The following year she joined the staff as assistant medical officer and then as the medical officer. Hearn was running a private gynaecological practice near Shandon, Cork during this time as well as working with the Lapp's Charity, Cork. In 1922 Hearn got membership of the RCPI, and on 18 October 1924 became the first woman to become a fellow of the college. Hearn maintained her qualification through postgraduate courses held in London every year until 1968.
An interesting side note about her is that her letter returning her fee for successfully sitting the membership examination for the RCPI was travelling through the GPO when it was damaged by the Irish Civil War. It nevertheless was delivered to her, despite the damage, stamped with the note "Salved from GPO Dublin".
Hearn gave dedicated service to the Victoria, serving on the board from 1938 and actively involved in the running of the hospital. Hearn showed great ability to attract donations to the hospital organising fund-raising events, both for the hospital and for her community. This made her famous among her colleagues. Her most popular annual fund-raiser was the tea and entertainment for outpatients at Christmas.
She also held appointments as the medical officer to the Rochelle School, Cork, and Midleton College, as well as that of honorary visiting physician to Lapps Charity in Cork.
Outside of her medical career, Hearn was a keen hockey player and represented Ireland from 1908 to 1912.
Family.
Hearn's husband was Robert Thomas Hearn, the Church of Ireland bishop of Cork, Cloyne, and Ross. They married in September 1911. He died in 1952. She had two children with him. Her son, Robert, who went to her graduation, also became a doctor and worked as a GP in Rugby, England. Her daughter, Ellice, studied law and became a barrister in London. who was made CBE for her work as a parliamentary draughtsman.
Death.
She lived on St Patrick's Hill in the centre of Cork and died 3 June 1969 after a brief illness, at the Victoria Hospital. The memorial fund in her honour was used to create a nurses' library. The RCPI's study and research room in Kildare Street is named the Hearn Room in her memory.

Willey House, New Hampshire

The Willey House at Crawford Notch in the White Mountains of New Hampshire is associated principally with a tragedy of August 28, 1826, in which seven members of the Willey family and two other people died. Out of that event came a boost to the nascent tourism industry of the area.
Background.
The Willey House was originally known as Old Notch House and had been built in 1793. Ethan Crawford acquired it in 1823 for use as an inn to accommodate his growing business as a mountain guide, and in 1826 it was occupied by a family headed by Samuel J. Willey Jr.
1826 disaster.
Northern New England experienced a drought in the summer of 1826, which ended with the arrival of a terrific storm on the evening of August 28. Flooding followed, with the valley at Crawford Notch being one place that suffered the consequences. All but two of the bridges on the turnpike that ran through the notch were destroyed, trees suffered a similar fate and the high sides of the valley were gouged by swollen streams and landslides. The Willey House was a scene of desolation due to the effects of an avalanche on a mountain behind it. The house, however, had survived in an island of calm because the surging debris split either side on a low ridge and then unified again beyond it.
Local residents, including Ethan Crawford and the Reverend Benjamin G. Willey, Samuel's brother, visited the house in the aftermath of the storm. It was empty, with signs that there may have been a rapid departure from it, such as unmade beds, clothes strewn around and ashes in the fireplace. There was an open Bible on the table. A search of the devastated area over the next few days revealed the bodies of the Willey parents, two of their daughters and two hired hands; the remains of the other three Willey children were never found. Some livestock had also been killed, including those in a now-destroyed stable.
There followed various theories as to what had happened, the most likely of which is that the occupants abandoned the property as the avalanche approached but in doing so, in darkness, they unwittingly put themselves in the path of it around the point where the flow reunited.
Tourist attraction.
News of the disaster spread, initially through many regional newspapers, and also through media such as Theodore Dwight's guidebook, "The Northern Traveller". People began to visit the site, drawn to the scene of devastation, human tragedy and the miraculous survival of the structure itself. As well as boosting a nascent tourist industry in the area, in which the Crawford family had already been playing a significant part, it became a source of inspiration for artists and writers. The peak on the western wall of the notch became known as Mount Willey.
Dona Brown believes that the artist Thomas Cole and other visitors, such as Nathaniel Hawthorne, used the interest in the tragedy to draw interest to their work, deliberately painting and writing about an area that had suddenly gained national attention. Ethan Crawford, too, exploited it by, for example, ensuring that the Willey House was well signposted. The Crawfords had been directly affected by the storm, with Ethan's property suffering 1000 of damage and his father's farm being wrecked almost beyond repair, but they were also affected in a positive manner with the subsequent influx of tourists. In 1828, Ethan began construction of a new inn, called the Notch House, at the northern end of the notch, appointing his brother Thomas to run it. The business opened in 1829 and attracted many notable people, including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau and Daniel Webster.
Hawthorne was inspired by the Willey tragedy to write a short story titled "The Ambitious Guest" in 1835, while Cole noted in his diary that "The site of the Willey House, with its little patch of green in the gloomy desolation, very naturally recalled to mind the horrors of the night when the whole family perished beneath an avalanche of rocks and earth."
Horace Fabyan, who was a merchant and a speculator in the emerging tourism industry, took control of the Willey House in 1845 and converted it into a 50-bed hotel. Visitor interest in the effects of the disastrous storm waned over time, despite the efforts of people such as Benjamin Willey to maintain and profit by it by offering guided tours of the house for a fee. It had become old news and nature had taken it course to cover much of the scenic damage.
The site of the house and the landslide is now an interpretive center within Crawford Notch State Park.

Janet Boyman

Janet Boyman (d. 1572), also known as Jonet Boyman or Janet Bowman, was a Scottish woman accused of witchcraft; she was tried and executed in 1572 although the case against her was started in 1570. Her indictment has been described by modern-day scholars, such as Lizanne Henderson, as the earliest and most comprehensive record of witchcraft and fairy belief in Scotland.
Accusations of witchcraft.
Janet Boyman lived in the Cowgate of Edinburgh, and was said to have been from Ayrshire. She was married to William Steill. In early modern Scotland married women did not change their surnames.
She was alleged to have predicted the death of Regent Moray who was assassinated in January 1570, and her accusation was the first to be made in connection with a political conspiracy.
She told her interrogators that she made contact with the supernatural world at a well on the south side of Arthur's Seat a hill close to Edinburgh. There she conjured spirits who would help her heal others. Sometimes she worked cures by washing the patients's shirt at the well at St Leonards.
She was condemned as:ane wyss woman that culd mend diverss seikness and bairnis that are tane away with fairyie men and wemen&lt;br&gt;a wise woman that could heal diverse illnesses and children taken away by fairy men and women.
Jonet Boyman was executed on 29 December 1572.
Personal life.
There is little information available concerning Boyman's personal life; however the trial record shows her as living in Cowgate, a street in Edinburgh. No indication is given of her age but she was married to William Steill.

Hatheburg of Merseburg

Hatheburg (also Hatheburch) (* 876 in Merseburg; † on 21 June after 909) was a Frankish queen, the first wife of Henry the Fowler, later king of East Francia (Germany). After their marriage was dissolved, Hatheburg became abbess of a convent.
Family.
Hatheburg was the daughter of Erwin of Mersburg, who possessed property in Hassegau and Friesenfeld. The name of Hatheburg's mother is Wendilgarde and her mother's sister, Hildegard, was married to Thietmar, Count of Merseburg, who was Henry the Fowler's military tutor ("vir disciplinae militaris peritissmus"). Erwin had no sons and Hatheburg and her sister were the heirs to his property.
Life.
Hatheburg was married around 890, for the first time, to a man whose name is not known. She was widowed shortly afterwards, and entered a monastery where she took the veil.
According to the chronicler Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg, "burning with youthful love", Henry wanted to marry Hatheburg because of "her beauty and the usefulness of her inherited wealth". Hatheburg and Henry married in 906, and Henry gained control of Hathburg's inheritance. Because Hatheburg had taken the veil, and the couple married without dispensation, their marriage was condemned by Bishop Sigismund of Halberstadt. The couple were threatened with excommunication at a church synod. According to Thietmar, Henry was "disturbed by such talk" and decided to approach the emperor, Conrad I of Germany for help. Conrad ensured that the sentence of excommunication was deferred, and the couple remained married. Yet by 909, Henry began to burn "for the beauty and wealth" of another woman: Matilda of Ringelheim. Henry declared his marriage to Hatheburg has been unlawful, due to her prior vows as a nun, and the couple separated. Hatheburg returned to the convent, where she became abbess, and Henry married Matilda.
Children.
Probably in 906 Hatheburg gave birth to Henry's son, Thankmar. Because the validity of Hatheburg and Henry's marriage was questioned, so was Thankmar's legitimacy.

Wood of Cree

Wood of Cree is a nature reserve in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. Located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) north north-west of Newton Stewart, it is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.
Consisting of about 690 acres, it is Southern Scotland's largest ancient woodland, and is home to around 113 bird species. It is also considered one of the best bluebell carpet sites in Scotland.
In 2006, the RSPB bought out the adjacent Barclye Farm, consisting of some 996 acres with the intent of extending the woodland by a further 670 acres. It will eventually allow users to walk through around 18 km of uninterrupted deciduous forest.

Torre Argentina Cat Sanctuary

The Torre Argentina Cat Sanctuary is a cat shelter in Rome, Italy, that makes use of the ancient ruins of Largo di Torre Argentina by providing a home within them for around 150 cats.
After the excavation of the temple ruins in 1929, feral cats were drawn to the area, sheltered by Roman pillars and fed by locals. In the 1950s, an actor named Antonio Crast found the old warehouse where archeologists of the 1920s stored their tools. It was there that he began feeding the feral cats. The keys to the warehouse were passed down until they landed in the hands of the founders of the sanctuary—one of them being Lia Dequel. Since then the shelter has grown, with volunteers coming every day of the week to feed, care for, and vaccinate the cats.
The shelter's main goal is sterilizing the cats. They spay and neuter cats in order to control the feral cat population. Not only do they spay and neuter cats in their own colony, but they also focus efforts on spaying and neutering and vaccinating cats of other colonies. They have, in the last decade, managed to reach out to 27,000 colonies of cats. They also have many cats up for adoption. They hope to find loving homes for many of the felines in the sanctuary. On average, the sanctuary finds loving homes for 125 cats a year. In their headquarters the shelter provides a home for handicapped and elderly cats, who are less likely to be adopted. The shelter is open to visitors every day. People can come in to meet the cats, and to browse souvenirs made by the volunteers at the shelter. All proceeds go towards the cats there, and donations, like these, allow the shelter to stay in operation.
In 2012 the shelter faced closure when national archaeological officials demanded that the cat sanctuary be evicted from the ruins. Over 30,000 signatures were collected for petitions in favor of preserving the cat sanctuary and keeping it running. Despite a compromise, the sanctuary still lives with the threat of an eviction—relying on donations more than ever in order to keep their home at Torre Argentina.
In 2019, the podcast "This is Love" visited Torre Argentina and spoke with co-founder Silvia Viviani for their episode, "Silvia and the Cats."

Naegi Castle

 was a Japanese castle that formed the administrative center of Naegi Domain, a feudal domain of the Tōyama clan, located in what is now part of the city of Nakatsugawa in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. It also referred to as , Naegi Castle was also known as "Akakabe Castle", as its walls were not white like many Japanese castles, but made with a reddish colored clay. The ruins have been protected as a National Historic Site since 1981.
History.
The Tōyama clan were rulers of southeastern Mino Province since at least the Kamakura period. Naegi Castle was constructed in 1532 by Tōyama Naokado, the second son of Tōyama Kagetomo, the lord of Iwamura Castle and husband of Oda Nobunaga’s sister, Otsuya no Kata. His daughter was adopted by Nobunaga, and married to Takeda Katsuyori in an effort to stave off Takeda designs on Mino. After Iwamura Castle fell to the Takeda, Nobunaga considered Naegi Castle to be the most important defense against the Takeda clan.
However, following the assassination of Nobunaga in 1583 at the Honnō-ji Incident, the castle fell into the hands of Mori Nagayoshi, one of Toyotomi Hideyoshi's generals. The Mori assigned Kawajiri Hidenaga as castellan and the Tōyama clan fled to Hamamatsu, where they went into the service of Tokugawa Ieyasu.
At the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Kawajiri sided with the pro-Toyotomi Eastern Army under Ishida Mitsunari, and was killed in battle. Ieyasu sent Tōyama Tomomasa, the son of its former castellan to retake Naegi Castle. Afterwards, he was confirmed as a "daimyō" over his clan's ancestral holdings, which marked the start of Naegi Domain under the Tokugawa shogunate. The Tōyama clan remained at the castle through 12 generations until the Meiji Restoration.
Naegi Castle was abandoned and dismantled in 1871, with its furnishing and most of the buildings’ timbers being auctioned off to help pay off the domain's massive debt. Today, a restoration of the main keep strut-work now serves as a lookout over Nakatsugawa and the Kiso River. There is a museum below the castle site with a diorama showing what the castle looked like before its destruction.
Description.
Naegi Castle occupies a very unusual layout on a bluff called "Mount Takamori" (432 meters) overlooking the Kiso River and the Nakasendō highway. This was a very strategic location, as it controlled both land and river routes between Owari Province and Mino Province.
The castle's layout utilizes the Kiso River as a natural moat to one side. The main gate of the castle was located at the foot of the mountain on the right bank of the Kiso River, and a steep road led to the top of the mountain with 48 sharp turns. The top of the hill was stripped of vegetation and soil; however the exposed massive boulders were left intact and were incorporated into the defensive walls. On top of the hill, an elaborate framework of timber formed a platform, on which the "tenshu" was constructed. The "tenshu" itself was nine meters wide by eleven meters long, and stood three floors high. The summit was surrounded by the Ni-no-maru enclosure in a spiral shape, with the palace located slightly lower on the mountain on the west side. Some of the outer stone walls of the castle were renovated in the Edo period, but the walls in the southwestern portion of the main bailey date from the Sengoku period.
The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017. The castle site is located about 17 minutes by car from Nakatsugawa Station on the JR East Chūō Main Line.

St Peter's Church, Linlithgow

St Peter's Church, Linlithgow is a parish of the Scottish Episcopal Church in the town of Linlithgow, Scotland, in the Diocese of Edinburgh. Its historic parish church on Linlithgow High Street is a Category B listed building.
History.
The church's origins as an organisation date back to 1912, when a group of local Episcopalians formed a group called the St Peter's Episcopal Mission. In its early years, the congregation had no permanent building, and at first used a variety of locations around the town: the Court Room of the Burgh Halls, a closed public house and an assortment of shops. They secured the use of a hall on the High Street, only for it to be requisitioned by the army in 1914. They then used the defunct Craigmailen United Free Church, but were forced to vacate the building due to dry rot. The congregation also used rooms owned by the Scotch Girls Friendly Society, then a room at the Palace Hotel.
This situation lasted until 1924, when the congregation's Priest-in-Charge, Rev W.S. Snow, reported their plight to the Bishop of Edinburgh, G.H.S. Walpole. The bishop put down £100 to purchase a site on the High Street, and promised a further £500 towards the cost, this to come from a speaking tour he was about to give in the USA. Even with this, the first plan of architect J.W. Todd proved too costly, and the congregation could not have afforded the £1600 bill. A less ambitious £1000 design was later adopted. The church was required to slot into a space measuring just 26 feet in width. The church's unusual Byzantine design was chosen at least in part because it would alleviate the problem of letting sufficient light into such a narrow space with taller buildings on either side.
The founding stone was laid by Colonel Maclaren of the Craigs on 18 May 1927, and the church was completed almost exactly a year later. Despite the fact that the congregation had always been named St Peter's, Bishop Walpole dedicated it to St Mildred, with whom his late wife had shared a name. The name reverted to St Peter's in 1978, though St Mildred is still featured on one of the stained glass windows in the sanctuary.
Organisation.
The church is linked with St Columba's Church in nearby Bathgate.

D'Arcy originally qualified as a doctor, before completing further M.A. and Ph.D. qualifications in Creative Writing at University College Cork. She teaches in the Women's Studies and Adult Education departments of the University.
Career and major works.
Kathy D'Arcy is the author of two collections of poetry, "Encounter" (Lapwing 2010) and "The Wild Pupil" (Bradshaw 2012). Her doctoral research was funded by an Irish Research Council Postgraduate Scholarship. D'Arcy has also written plays. Her first play, "Retreat", was performed in the Granary theatre in 2008. D'Arcy's second play, "This is My Constitution", was performed in Dáil Éireann at a parliamentary briefing on gender bias in the Irish Constitution during the Constitutional Convention in 2014.
In 2017, she was awarded first prize in the FPM Hippocrates Heath Professional Award for her poem "Inside". D'Arcy has stated that "Inside" is a poem about the human heart and people's relationship with it.

D'Arcy collaborated with New Binary Press to edit a collection of writing called "Autonomy" in 2018, a woman-led collection focusing on bodily autonomy. The proceeds from the collection are donated to the campaign for free, safe and legal abortion in Ireland. According to D'Arcy, the collection includes "not just stories about abortion, though there are many – stories about all of the ways our bodily integrity can be attacked, and how we can rise up nonetheless and speak out for ourselves and others. Contributors wrote about sexuality, ability, belonging, violence, mortality, compassion, support, celebration."
In 2013, D'Arcy wrote and performed "This Is My Constitution", a play about the impact that the Irish Constitution has on the lives and bodies of women in Ireland. In particular the play focuses on the 1937 fight by women in Ireland to change the draft Constitution. She performed it in Paul Street Square in Cork City on 12 February 2013, as well as other locations around Ireland with the support of the National Women's Council of Ireland. A performance of the play was also supported by Cork Feminista. This was performed on 13 April in Cork City Centre by Ungovernable Bodies, and directed by Judie Chambers.

Butterworth, Virginia

Butterworth is an unincorporated community in Dinwiddie County, Virginia, United States.
Butterworth is located along a former railroad mainline. The Richmond, Petersburg and Carolina Railroad, passing through Butterworth from Petersburg, Virginia to Ridgeway Junction (today Norlina, North Carolina), was completed in 1900, at which point it was merged into the Seaboard Air Line (SAL). By 1914, the population of Butterworth was estimate by the railroad to be somewhere around 400. The line (dubbed the "S-line" after later mergers) continued to operate until the 1980s, and today Butterworth is along the abandoned portion of the CSX Norlina Subdivision.

Maitland Mines

The Maitland Mines are several disused lead mines located on the Maitland River near Port Elizabeth in South Africa. Geologically the mine is located in Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of the Karoo Supergroup.
There are records of ore analyses from these deposits dating back to 1782 or 1792. Henry Lichtenstein visited the site in 1805 and they were again explored during the office of Governor Janssens. In 1856 A. Wyley reported 'a considerable amount of underground exploration without any apparent measure of success'. Nonetheless the deposits were again examined between 1924 and 1931. These revealed small veins and deposits of ore, with no lode or body of ore promising commercial success. The dolomitic limestone carrying the ore is in the shape of a simple syncline, both legs dipping towards the Maitland River. The trough of this syncline was regarded as the most promising site, but after much drilling did not fulfil expectations. The ore consists of argentiferous galena, chalcopyrite and chalcocite with malachite and azurite, in irregular stringers and elongate nodules, indicating development of minerals along crush zones.
During the era of muzzle-loaders lead was processed in the Transvaal, the lead coming mostly from near Argent, where a smelter was constructed between 1889 and 1893. These deposits were mined until 1957, when operations ceased. The production of lead was negligible until 1980, when the Black Mountain Mineral Development Company near Aggeneys commenced mining and South Africa became a net exporter. Other deposits were mined in the Marico district, at Edendale near Pretoria, and at the Balloch Mine at Niekerkshoop in the Cape Province, and a zinc-lead mine at Pering, 75 km from Vryburg.

Mary Galway Houston

Mary Galway Houston (27 July 1871 – 24 April 1962) was an Irish craftswoman, teacher, and author. She was known for her leather work and repoussé metalwork. She was known for her writings on the history of costume and costume design.
Early life and education.
Mary Galway Houston was born 27 July 1871 at Coleraine Academical Institution, Coleraine, County Londonderry. She was the daughter of Thomas Galway Houston, headmaster of Coleraine Academical Institution, and Maud Steen Houston (née Millar). She attended the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, winning a number of prizes in final year. She exhibited leather work, repoussé metalwork, lace and crochet designs as well as drawings at the Royal Dublin Society (1894-1896) and at the first exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland in 1895. She entered the Royal College of Art in London in 1896, regularly exhibiting with the English Arts and Crafts Society and the Royal Academy of Arts from 1901. During this time, she entered numerous national competitions, with her submissions often used as illustrations in art magazines. Houston was a gold medallist for the 1898 competition to design the modelled leather cover for the Kelmscott Chaucer.
Artistic career.
Houston became increasingly lauded for the leather work, exhibiting leather bookbindings and embossed-and-modelled leather panels from 1898 to 1903. She wrote an article on embossed and chased leatherwork in the "Art Workers' Quarterly" (1903) which was illustrated with her set of four relief panels scenes from "Homer". Houston also undertook work in other media including needlework, and working silver, copper, and tin in repoussé metalwork. At the 1899 English Arts and Crafts Society exhibition she exhibited an art-nouveau silver mirror-back, and at the 1900 Paris exhibition with a three-piece toilet in beaten silver. All of her early work is predominantly in art nouveau, with her moving to a more Celtic style from around 1900. These Celtic designs drew on Irish myth and legend, drawing on ancient Celtic and medieval Irish prototypes.
In 1900 The Studio magazine commissioned her to create two silver cups to accompany an article calling for the improvement of the design of sporting trophies and sups. This was her first attempt at metal working in the round, and she drew inspiration from the Dunvegan Cup and Methers, an ancient three-handled vessel. Though she was based in London, Houston continued to exhibit at the RDS and the annual exhibitions of the Irish Decorative Art Association. In 1903, she designed a tapestry panel of "A voyage to Tir-na-noge" for the Dun Emer Guild, and in 1904 created a tooled leather album cover which was presented to James Brenan upon his retirement. From 1903, Houston taught at the Camberwell School of Art in London.
Writing.
Houston developed an interest in the history of dress and costume design and went on to publish "A technical history of costume in three volumes: Ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Persian costumes and decorations" (1920, co-authored with Florence S. Hornblower), "Ancient Greek, Roman, and Byzantine costume and decoration, including Cretan costume" (1931), and "Medieval costume in England and France: the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries" (1939).
Later life.
Towards the end of her life, Houston rarely exhibited. Her final publication was in 1954, with a second edition of the revised and retitled "Ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Persian costume". It is believed she moved back to Ireland some time after this point. Houston's exact death date and place of death are generally stated to be unknown, but she appears to have died in Coleraine on 24 April 1962.

<doc id="56802143" url="?curid=56802143" title="Mauro-Roman Kingdom">
Mauro-Roman Kingdom

The Mauro-Roman Kingdom (Latin: "Regnum Maurorum et Romanorum") was an independent Christian Berber kingdom centred in the capital city of Altava (present day Algeria) which controlled much of the ancient Roman province of Mauretania Caesariensis. The kingdom was first formed in the fifth century as Roman control over the province weakened and Imperial resources had to be concentrated elsewhere, notably in defending the Italian Peninsula itself from invading Germanic tribes.
The rulers of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would repeatedly come into conflict with the Vandals of the neighbouring Vandalic Kingdom, which had been established following the Vandalic conquest of the Roman province of Africa. King Masuna of the Moors and Romans would ally with the armies of the Eastern Roman Empire during their reconquest of Northern Africa in the Vandalic War. Following the Eastern Roman victory over the Vandals, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would maintain its alliance with the Eastern Roman Empire, assisting it in wars against invading Berbers of other tribes and kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of the Aures.
Eventually, the diplomatic ties between the Eastern Roman Empire and the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would break down. King Garmul would invade the Eastern Roman Praetorian Prefecture of Africa in an attempt at capturing Roman territories. His defeat in 578 AD led almost immediately to the end of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, which was fragmented and partially reincorporated into the Roman Empire.
The kingdom was succeeded by some smaller Romanized Berber successor states, such as the Kingdom of Altava. These petty kingdoms would last in the Maghreb until the conquest of the region by the Umayyad Caliphate in the seventh and eighth centuries.
History.
Background.
Mauretania and western Numidia, previously a Roman client kingdom, were fully annexed by the Roman Empire in 40 AD and divided into two provinces under Emperor Claudius; Mauretania Tingitana ("Tangerine Mauretania") and Mauretania Caesariensis ("Caesarian Mauretania"), with the separating border designated as Moulouya River.
Northern Africa was not as well-defended as frontiers that saw frequent attacks, such as those against Germania and Persia, but the economic importance of the African provinces made them important to retain. To this end, defensive structures were constructed alongside their borders, such as the "Fossatum Africae"; a 750 km long linear defensive structure composed of ditches, stone walls and other fortifications. This structure would be in consistent use until the Vandal conquest of the province of Africa. The Mauretanian frontier, not as well defended as that of the African frontier, was known as the "Limes Mauretaniae".
As Roman authority became occupied elsewhere during the disastrous civil wars and disintegrations of the Crisis of the Third Century, local nomadic Berber tribes harassed settlements and occupied some of the border regions of Mauretania Tingitania and Mauretania Caesariensis. The incursions were seen as such a large threat that the Western Roman Emperor, Maximian, personally became involved in the conflict. Three Berber tribes, the Bavares, Quinquegentiani and Fraxinenses, had formed a confederation. Though the Berbers faced a defeat against a small army raised by the governor of Mauretania Caesariensis in 289 AD, they soon returned. In 296 AD, Maximian raised an army, from Praetorian cohorts, Aquileian, Egyptian, and Danubian legionaries, Gallic and German auxiliaries, and Thracian recruits, advancing through Spain that autumn. He may have defended the region against raiding Berbers before crossing the Strait of Gibraltar into Mauretania Tingitana to protect the area from Frankish pirates.
Maximian began an offensive against the invading tribes in March 297 AD, and pursued them even beyond the borders of the Empire, not content with simply letting them return to their homelands in the Atlas Mountains, from which they would be able to continue to wage war. Though the Berbers were skilled at guerrilla warfare and the terrain was unfavorable, Maximian continued his campaign deep into Berber territory. When the campaign was concluded in 298 AD, Maximian had driven the tribes back into the Sahara, devastated previously secure land and killed as many as he could. On March 10, he made a triumphal entry into Carthage, with the people hailing him as "redditor lucis aeternae" ("restorer of the eternal light").
Establishment.
The fifth century would see the collapse and fall of the Western Roman Empire. The inland territories of Mauretania had already been under Berber control since the fourth century, with direct Roman rule confined to coastal cities such as Septem in Mauretania Tingitania and Caesarea in Mauretania Caesariensis. The Berber rulers of the inland territories maintained a degree of Roman culture, including the local cities and settlements, and often nominally acknowledged the suzerainty of the Roman Emperors.
As barbarian incursions became more common even in previously secure provinces such as Italy, the Western Roman military became increasingly occupied to defend territories in the northern parts of the Empire. Even the vital Rhine frontier against Germania had been stripped of troops in order to organize a defense against a Visigothic army invading Italy under Alaric. The undermanned frontier allowed several tribes, such as the Vandals, Alans and Suebi, to cross the Rhine in 406 AD and invade Roman territory. As attention was needed elsewhere, central authority began to collapse in many of the more distant provinces.
In 423, there was a powerful uprising of the Berbers of Mauritania and Numidia, which was suppressed only with great difficulty by Count Boniface in 427. In 429, however, Vandals and Alans led by Gaiseric invaded Mauritania from Hispania. The Berbers supported them, causing Roman rule to disappear from the province by 439. At the same time, it enabled the Romanized Berbers to form an independent state with their capital in Altava.
In Mauretania, local Berber leaders and tribes had long been integrated into the imperial system as allies, "foederati" and frontier commanders and as Roman control weakened, they established their own kingdoms and polities in the region. The presence of romanized communities along the frontier regions of the provinces meant that the Berber chieftains had some experience in governing populations composed of both Berbers and Romans. Following the final collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom would grow into a fully fledged Barbarian kingdom not entirely unlike those that had sprung up in other parts of the former Empire. Though most other Barbarian kingdoms, such as those of the Visigoths and Vandals, were fully within the borders of the former Roman Empire, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom extended beyond the formal imperial frontier, also encompassing Berber territories never controlled by the Romans.
According to the Eastern Roman historian Procopius, the Moors only began to truly expand and consolidate their power following the death of the powerful vandal king Gaiseric in 477 AD, after which they won many victories against the Vandal kingdom and established more or less full control over the former province of Mauretania. Having feared Gaiseric, the Moors under Vandal control revolted against his successor Huneric following his attempt to convert them to Arian Christianity and the harsh punishments incurred on those who did not convert. In the Aurès Mountains, this led to the foundation of the independent Kingdom of the Aures, which was fully independent by the time of Huneric's death in 484 AD and would never again come under Vandal rule. Under the rule of Huneric's successors Gunthamund and Thrasamund, the wars between the Berbers and the Vandals continued. During Thrasamund's reign, the Vandals suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of a Berber king ruling the city Tripolis, named Cabaon, who almost completely destroyed a Vandal army that had been sent to subjugate the city.
Kings of the Moors and Romans.
One of the Berber rulers of Mauretania, Masuna, titled himself as "Rex gentium Maurorum et Romanorum", the "King of the Roman and Moorish peoples". Masuna is known only from an inscription on a fortification in Altava (modern Ouled Mimoun, in the region of Oran), dated 508 AD. He is known to have possessed Altava, assumed to have been the capital due to its prominence under subsequent kings, and at least two other cities, "Castra Severiana" and "Safar", as mention is made of officials he appointed there. As the seat of an ecclesiarchal diocese (the diocese of Castra Severiana, an ancient bishophoric which flourished during Late Antiquity), the control of "Castra Severiana" may have been particularly important.
The core administrative centers of the kingdom were located on the territorial interface of two distinct populations, the coastal and settled provincial "Romani" (Romans) and the tribal "Mauri" (Moors, or Berbers) situated around and beyond the former Roman frontier. The citizens of the Roman cities were subjects of a formal and organized administration headed by appointed officials, such as those appointed by King Masuna. The military manpower was derived from the Berber tribes over which control was maintained through the control of key individuals, such as tribal leaders, by issuing honors and estates to them. As the Mauro-Roman Kingdom adopted the military, religious and sociocultural organization of the Roman Empire, it continued to be fully within the Western Latin world. The administrative structure and titulature used by the rulers of the kingdom suggests a certain romanized political identity in the region. This Roman political identity was maintained by other smaller Berber kingdoms in the region as well, such as in the Kingdom of the Aures where King Masties claimed the title of "Imperator" during his rule around 516 AD, postulating that he had not broken trust with either his Berber or Roman subjects.
The Eastern Roman Empire and the Vandals.
Eastern Roman records referring to the Vandal Kingdom, which had occupied much of the old Roman province of Africa and coastal parts of Mauretania, often refer to it with regards to a trinity of peoples; Vandals, Alans and Moors, and though some Berbers had assisted the Vandals in their conquests in Africa, Berber expansionism for the most part, was focused against the Vandals and would lead to the expansion of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom and other Berber kingdoms of the region, such as the Kingdom of the Aures.
A Berber king identified by the historian Procopius of the Eastern Roman Empire as "Massonas" (often assumed to be the same person as Masuna) allied with the forces of the Eastern Roman Empire in 535 AD against the Vandal Kingdom during the Vandalic War. When Belisarius and the Eastern Roman forces arrived in Northern Africa to invade and restore Roman rule over the region, local Berber rulers willingly submitted to Imperial rule, only demanding in return the symbols of their offices; a silver crown, a staff of silver gilt, a tunic and gilded boots. Essentially client kings, many of the Berber rulers would prove recalcitrant. Those rulers that were not directly adjacent to Imperial territories were more or less independent, though nominally still Imperial subjects, and were treated with larger amounts of courtesy than the ones directly bordering the Empire, as to keep them in line.
Gelimer, the final Vandal king, attempted to recruit the Berber kingdoms to fight for him but very few Berber troops took part in fighting for the Vandal side. Though the Vandals had supplied the Berber kings with symbols of their offices similar to those supplied by the Romans, the Berber kings did not consider the Vandals to hold that power securely. During the Vandalic war, most Berber rulers waited out the conflict in order to avoid fighting for the losing side.
Following the Eastern Roman re-conquest of the Vandal Kingdom, the local governors began to experience problems with the local Berber tribes. The province of Byzacena was invaded and the local garrison, including the commanders Gainas and Rufinus, was defeated. The newly appointed Praetorian prefect of Africa, Solomon, waged several wars against these Berber tribes, leading an army of around 18,000 men into Byzacena. Solomon would defeat them and return to Carthage, though the Berbers would again rise and overrun Byzacena. Solomon would once again defeat them, this time decisively, scattering the Berber forces. Surviving Berber soldiers retreated into Numidia where they joined forces with Iabdas, King of the Aures.
Masuna, allied with the Eastern Empire, and another Berber king, Ortaias (who ruled a kingdom in the former province of Mauretania Sitifensis), urged Solomon to pursue the enemy Berbers into Numidia, which he did. Solomon did not engage Iabdas in battle, however, distrusting the loyalty of his allies, and instead constructed a series of fortified posts along the roads linking Byzacena with Numidia.
Masuna died around 535 AD and was succeeded as king by Mastigas (also known as Mastinas). Procopius states that Mastigas was a fully independent ruler who ruled almost the entire former province of Mauretania Caesariensis, except for the former provincial capital, Caesarea, which had been under control of the Vandals and was in Eastern Roman hands during his time. The rulers of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, and other Berber kingdoms, continued to regard themselves as subjects of the Eastern Roman Emperor in Constantinople, even when they were at war with him or engaged in raids of Imperial territory, most Berber rulers using titles such as "dux" or "rex".
Collapse.
The last recorded king was Garmul (also known as Garmules) who would resist Eastern Roman rule in Africa. In the late 560s, Garmul launched raids into Roman territory, and although he failed to take any significant town, three successive generals, Praetorian prefect Theodore (in 570 AD) and the two "magistri militum" Theoctistus (in 570 AD) and Amabilis (in 571 AD), are recorded by the Visigoth historian John of Biclaro to have been killed by Garmul's forces. His activities, especially when regarded together with the simultaneous Visigoth attacks in Spania, presented a clear threat to the province's authorities. Garmul was not the leader of a mere semi-nomadic tribe, but of a fully-fledged barbarian kingdom, with a standing army. Thus, the new Eastern Roman emperor, Tiberius II Constantine, re-appointed Thomas as praetorian prefect of Africa, and the able general Gennadius was posted as "magister militum" with the clear aim of reducing Garmul's kingdom. Preparations were lengthy and careful, but the campaign itself, launched in 577–78 AD, was brief and effective, with Gennadius utilizing terror tactics against Garmul's subjects. Garmul was defeated and killed in 578 AD.
With the defeat of Garmul, the Mauro-Roman Kingdom collapsed. The Eastern Roman Empire re-incorporated some of the territory of the Kingdom, notably the coastal corridor of the old provinces of Mauretania Tingitania and Mauretania Caesariensis.
Legacy.
Altava remained the capital of a romanized Berber kingdom, though the Kingdom of Altava was significantly smaller in size than the Kingdom of Masuna and Garmul had been. In the late fifth and early sixth century, Christianity grew to be the fully dominant religion in the Berber Altava kingdom, with syncretic influences from the traditional Berber religion. A new church was built in the capital Altava in this period. Altava and the other successor kingdoms of the Mauro-Roman Kingdom, the Kingdoms of the Ouarsenis and the Hodna, also saw an economical rise and the construction of several new churches and fortifications. Though the Eastern Roman Praetorian Prefecture of Africa and the later Exarchate of Africa would see some further Berber rebellions, these would be put down and many Berber tribes would be accepted as "foederati", as they had been many times in the past.
The last known romanized Berber King to rule from Altava was Kusaila. He died in the year 690 AD fighting against the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb. He was also leader of the Awraba tribe of the Berbers and possibly Christian head of the Sanhaja confederation. He is known for having led an effective Berber martial resistance against the Umayyad Caliphate's conquest of the Maghreb in the 680s. In 683 AD Uqba ibn Nafi was ambushed and killed in the Battle of Vescera near Biskra by Kusaila, who forced all Arabs to evacuate their just founded Kairouan and withdraw to Cyrenaica. But in 688 AD Arab reinforcements from Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan arrived under Zuhair ibn Kays. Kusaila met them in 690 AD, with the support of Eastern Roman troops, at the Battle of Mamma. Vastly outnumbered, the Awraba and Romans were defeated and Kusaila was killed.
With the death of Kusaila, the torch of resistance passed to a tribe known as the Jerawa tribe, who had their home in the Aurès Mountains: his Christian Berber troops after his death fought later under Kahina, the queen of the Kingdom of the Aures and the last ruler of the romanized Berbers.

Josephine Sabel

Josephine Domingue Sabel (October 3, 1866 – December 24, 1945) was an American singer and comedian, billed as "The Queen of Song" in vaudeville.
Early life.
Josephine Domingue was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts.
Career.
Sabel was a vaudeville performer for many years, billed as "The Queen of Song." She popularized songs including "A Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight", "Somebody Loves Me", and "Bicycle Built for Two". She also sang "coon songs" that caricatured African-American speech and culture, for example "Bye Bye Belinda" (written by H. Y. Leavitt, billed as a "Darktown Triumph") and "Little Alabama Coon", an 1893 hit song written by Hattie Starr. She continued performing late in her life, as a nostalgia act in the 1930s.
Sabel's Broadway credits included roles in the musicals "Punch, Judy and Company" (1903), "Earl Carroll's Vanities" (1925), "Oh Please" (1925-1926), and "Sidewalks of New York" (1927-1928). She appeared in several films: "Corn Top Bread" (1930), "The March of Time" (1930, unfinished), and "Broadway to Hollywood" (1933).
Sabel was not known for a pleasing voice, but for her humor and stage presence. "Miss Sabel does not sing much, and never did," explained a newspaper account in 1904, "Most of her singing is yelling, but she yells well." Critic Frank Norris wrote of her, "Josephine Sabel is not what you would call pretty, but she is French to her fingers and toes, which is much better. She can do precisely what she likes with her audiences — making them laugh or weep or whistle at her will." She emphasized her French connections with the latest fashions from Paris, so that her clothing on and off stage were described in detail in the press.
Personal life.
Josephine Domingue married David Sabel, her manager. She died in 1945, aged 79 years, at a care home in Patchogue, New York where she had lived since 1937.

(Original description) It has the shape of "Mitromorpha alba" but has crowded axial incisions granulating the spirals. It has also three spiral rows of small, square brown spots on the body whorl, one just below the suture, but not on the first spiral as in some of the typical "M. alba"; a second starting just above the aperture and winding round to just above the middle of the outer lip; a third beginning just above the two nodules on the outer lip and running over the back of the aperture. The upper two rows appear in the spire whorls. Sometimes the shell is flamed with very light-brown between the spots axially.
Distribution.
This marine species is endemic to Australia and occurs off South Australia.

In Music We Trust is a music webzine, publicity company, and record label based in Portland, Oregon. It was established as a webzine in July 1997 by Alex Steininger and his friend Ryan O'Neill. Its original goal was to help promote work by new artists. Steininger founded the website after losing his job at another online magazine, when he contacted O'Neill for his web design expertise and asked him for help. The website was named a "cool site" by the Open Directory Project. 
Record label.
In 2001, Steininger started In Music We Trust Records; its first release was Sean Croghan's debut solo album. That year, the "Willamette Week" reported that "In just a few short years of music obsession, Steininger has transformed himself into a dynamo of Portland's music scene, releasing albums by local supremos Luther Russell, Sean Croghan and Joe Davis." In 2004, the label released Matt Sharp's debut solo album, making it their biggest release to date at the time.

Ruth Bourne

Ruth June Bourne (née Henry; born 1926) was one of the Women of Bletchley Park, recruited to help win World War II against the Germans from 1939–1945. The Woman of Bletchley Park were a secret team put together by the British government, made to sign a Secrets Act confirming that they would not tell anyone about their work there. During her time at Bletchley, Ruth Bourne's job was not only to work on the German code, but to be a bombe operator. She was one of the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRENs) responsible for dismantling the bombes wire by wire after the war had ended in 1945.
Recruitment and role.
Aged 17 at the time, Ruth was a trainee member of the Women's Royal Naval Service when she was told that she would be joining the Women of Bletchley Park. She was offered to sign a contract that tied her into endless hours of work, no social life and no way to exit once she had agreed. Ruth was recruited to be a member of the team at as part of the SDX special duties. Bletchley Park workers consisted of two different teams the 'y station', the women responsible for picking up the German Enigma code and the 'x station', those who were responsible for bombe operation, like Ruth herself.
The job.
The majority of the women recruited had no previous experience of bombe operation and were going in to the job blindsighted. The workers were only shown a few machines for training purposes on recruitment of the job. They were told not to ask any questions. The role itself included "preparing the machines each day, turning the drums on the front and plugging up the boards at the back according to settings laid out in a menu". While Ruth was a checker she would be in charge of waiting for information to come through as 'confirmed'. When this happened she would then have to make a call to report the stop on the code menu which would be checked by other members of Bletchley.
Ruth's job meant that she was on her feet all day and there was little time for breaks. There was a term 'mustard', that meant the workers at Bletchley Park were told what they were going to do without any discussion or choice of their own. From the very first day of her work as a bombe operator to when her time at Bletchley ended, Ruth did what she was told on demand. Despite the little amount of agency the workers had at Bletchley, Bourne says herself that it was very satisfying to know that we were helping to break German codes. Her work as a bombe operator began in early 1944 and continued until the end of the war in 1945.
After the war.
In 1945 when World War II ended, all of the workers of Bletchley Park were told that they must continue to keep their work there a secret. It was not until 1974, when the book "The Ultra Secret" was published, that she, along with other Bletchley Park workers, were able to tell their families about their involvement in bringing down Nazi Germany. Ruth described what it was like when the news finally broke saying that "you got so used to not talking to anyone" that even after they were allowed to disclose their roles she still would not talk about her experience in depth.

<doc id="56802437" url="?curid=56802437" title="Obama Foundation">
Obama Foundation

The Barack Obama Foundation is a Chicago-based nonprofit organization founded in 2014. It oversees the creation of the Barack Obama Presidential Center, runs the My Brother's Keeper Alliance, a program Barack Obama began while he was President, and operates a scholarship program through the University of Chicago's Harris School of Public Policy.
History.
The Foundation held its inaugural summit on October 31, 2017, in Chicago. According to Barack Obama, he intends for his foundation to be central to many of his post-presidential activities, which he sees as having the potential to be more consequential than his time in the White House. In 2018, contributions and in-kind gifts totaled $164.8 million, according to its filed annual report in June 2019— a drop of $67.8 million from the $232.6 million raised in 2017.
The foundation's first President was Adewale Adeyemo, a Nigerian Economist and former Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economic Affairs who joined in August 2019. In 2020, President-elect Joe Biden selected Adeyemo to serve as Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, and he was replaced by Valerie Jarrett.
Barack Obama Presidential Center.
The Foundation's major project is to oversee the creation of the planned presidential library of former President Obama. In May 2015, the Foundation, along with Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, announced the development of the Center and its location in the Jackson Park neighborhood of Chicago's South Side. The planning process met with criticism from some local leaders who questioned the benefit for the surrounding area and did not feel the community was sufficiently involved. On February 26, 2019, Chicago residents voted to require a community benefits agreement in order to make the Center official, something to which the Obama Foundation has objected.
Updated plans were released in 2019, with some changes based on feedback. The complex includes four buildings, with a museum, public space, public library branch, and athletic center. It was designed by the architectural firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien.
, the center is set to begin construction sometime in 2021.
My Brother's Keeper Alliance.
The My Brother's Keeper Alliance (MBK Alliance) is a program inspired by President Obama's My Brother's Keeper Challenge that he started through the White House in 2014. Its purpose is to address challenges and opportunity gaps that boys and young men of color face, providing support through mentoring, education, job training, and other activities. In 2017, MBK Alliance was moved into the Obama Foundation.
Scholarships.
In February 2018 the Foundation announced it had begun a scholarship program at the University of Chicago. The scholarships are awarded to 25 American and international master's students in the Harris School of Public Policy in an effort to cultivate leadership through the Presidential Center. It covers the students' tuition and living expenses while they work with the foundation and take classes. It also began sponsoring fellowships called Obama Foundation Scholars at Columbia University, Obama's alma mater. In its first year, 2018, the non-degree-granting program paid the expenses and provided a stipend for 12 international students.

Native Council of Nova Scotia

The Native Council of Nova Scotia represents about 25,000 Mi’kmaq/Aboriginal peoples who are non-status or live off-reserve in Nova Scotia and issues its own identity cards. It works to improve their social, economic and political situation. Its head office is in Truro, and it has offices in Sydney, Nova Scotia, Liverpool, Dartmouth, Digby and Coldbrook.
Identity issues.
According to Canada's 2016 census, 51,495 Nova Scotians claim Aboriginal identity, but only 18,940 were considered “status Indians”, and 40.1 per cent of those live outside reserves. Many individuals choose to live off-reserve and relocate to an urban area like Halifax to seek education, employment or other economic opportunities. They are no longer members of Nova Scotia’s 13 on-reserve bands and are not included in the Mi'kmaq-Nova Scotia-Canada Tripartite Forum. They are not consulted over decisions related to natural resources and environment, and lose their land and hunting rights. The Daniels decision in 2016 ruled that non-status Indians have the legal right to be considered “Indians” under Canada's Constitution of 1867, but it was unclear what changes federal and provincial governments would make.
Programs.
The Helping Prepare for Employment/Education (HYPE) project announced in 2017 will provide First Nations youth with employment workshops and work placement opportunities. The Council supports healthy eating programs.
Politics.
The Council are opposed to hydraulic fracturing for oil and gas. Following the Daniels ruling, the Council are pressing both levels of government to negotiate tangible changes in access to social services, education, health care, and entitlements to commercial fishing.

Josha Vagnoman

Josha Mamadou Karaboue Vagnoman (born 11 December 2000) is a German professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Hamburger SV. He developed through the academy of Hamburger SV and has represented Germany at youth level.
Club career.
Hamburger SV.
Early career.
Vagnoman joined Hamburger SV in 2010, and went through the different youth levels at the club. In February 2018, following impressive performances in the youth teams, newly appointed head coach Bernd Hollerbach promoted him to the HSV first-team squad for the forthcoming campaign.
On 10 March 2018, Vagnoman made his first-team debut in the Bundesliga match against Bayern Munich. He came off the bench in the 70th minute, replacing Walace in a 0–6 home loss. He became the youngest player to ever play in the Bundesliga for Hamburger SV when he debuted at the age of 17 years and 89 days. Under new coach Christian Titz, Vagnoman did not make more first-team appearances that season. However, he made 20 appearances in the Under-19 league for HSV, scoring two goals.
2018–19 season.
Prior to the 2018–19 season, Vagnoman signed a new two-year contract with Hamburger SV, making him a permanent part of the first-team squad before his eighteenth birthday. Before the winter break, he made four appearances in the 2. Bundesliga for the club, making one start. Coach Titz and his successor, Hannes Wolf, preferred Gōtoku Sakai and Douglas Santos on the two back positions during this period.
In the latter part of the season Vagnoman saw slightly more playing time. He ended the season with 11 league appearances for the first team, adding to that another seven appearances and one goal for the reserves in fourth tier Regionalliga Nord.
2019–20 season.
At the beginning of the 2019–20 season, Vagnoman was benched under new head coach Dieter Hecking and mostly appeared for the reserves. As part of the Hamburger SV II team, he made three appearances in the Regionalliga Nord in which he scored three goals. After regular right-back Jan Gyamerah suffered a fibular fracture in mid-September, Vagnoman replaced him in the starting lineup in the following league game and made five straight appearances, in which he scored one goal. In October, he suffered a foot injury in a DFB-Pokal matchup against VfB Stuttgart which ruled him out for several months. In his absence, Khaled Narey took over as the third player to appear at right-back before Jordan Beyer arrived on loan during the January transfer window. In April 2020, Vagnoman recovered from his injury, and signed a four-year contract extension during the COVID-19 league suspension. When the league was resumed in mid-May, Vagnoman returned to the starting lineup as a right-back in a 2. Bundesliga match against SpVgg Greuther Fürth. He finished the season with 16 Bundesliga appearances in which he scored one goal.
2020–21 season.
On the first matchday of the 2020–21 season, Vagnoman was in the starting line-up under the new head coach Daniel Thioune for the game against Fortuna Düsseldorf (2–1 win), but in the following week of practice he suffered a tear in the outer ligament and an inner ligament strain in the left ankle. This ruled him out for a few weeks and afterwards was placed on the bench behind Jan Gyamerah on his return on the fifth matchday and in the following games. Due to an injury to Gyamerah, Vagnoman returned to the starting line-up on 5 December 2020 in a 0–1 home loss to Hannover 96, and was a regular starter until the end of the first half of the season, scoring 2 goals. In the 4–2 win against Eintracht Braunschweig on 23 January 2021, Vagnoman was replaced at half-time after suffering a torn ligament in his right ankle.
International career.
Eligible for both Germany and Ivory Coast, Vagnoman has represented Germany at every age group from under-17 to under-20 level. In October 2017, he was included in the squad for the 2017 UEFA European Under-17 Championship as an alternate to the injured Kilian Ludewig. He made three appearances in the tournament for the under-17s.
In March 2018, Vagnoman made one appearance for the German under-18 team, and played another two matches for the German under-19 team in November 2018. He ended as runner-up to the Fritz Walter Medal in August 2019 in the under-19 category, behind Nicolas-Gerrit Kühn. Since September 2019, Vagnoman has been part of the Germany under-20 team.
Personal life.
Vagnoman was born and raised in Hamburg, the son of an Ivorian mother and a German father.

Michael Patrick Stuart Irwin

Michael Patrick Stuart Irwin (1925 – 13 September 2017) was a British-Rhodesian ornithologist.
Biography.
Irwin was born in Northern Ireland and moved to Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) in 1949 where he met Reay Smithers, then director of the National Museum of Southern Rhodesia in Bulawayo, and soon became collector with the museum. In 1959 he was assistant curator of vertebrates, subsequently curator of ornithology, in 1975 regional director in Bulawayo, and finally associate ornithologist, and as of 2012 a natural history librarian in Norfolk.
Irwin worked closely with Constantine Walter Benson, an authority on central African birds. Together, they expanded the bird collection of the Natural History Museum of Zimbabwe until it became the largest both in Africa and in the southern hemisphere. It currently housed over 90,000 specimens from Zimbabwe and neighbouring countries and is one of the museum's greatest resources.
In 1981, Irwin published his best known work "The Birds of Zimbabwe", but he had previously published the "Bibliography of the Birds of Rhodesia" in 1978, and co-authored "A Checklist of Birds of Southern Rhodesia" (with Reay Smithers) in 1957 and "The Birds of Zambia" (with Constantine Walter Benson) in 1971. He contributed also to "The Birds of Africa" series (with Emil K. Urban, Stuart Keith and C. Hilary Fry) and has published more than 300 scientific papers, many of them in the museum's journal "Arnoldia".
Irwin described the subspecies "Spizocorys conirostris crypta" of the pink-billed lark in 1957, the subspecies "Eremopterix verticalis khama" of the grey-backed sparrow-lark in 1957, the subspecies "Calamonastes stierlingi pinto" of the Stierling's wren-warbler in 1960, and together with Benson the subspecies "Eremopterix verticalis harti" in 1965 and the subspecies "Mirafra fasciolata reynoldsi" of the eastern clapper lark in 1965. In collaboration with Phillip Clancey he described the monotypic genus "Arcanator" for the dapple-throat in 1986.
Irwin was editor of "Honeyguide", an ornithological journal of Bird Life Zimbabwe, for 24 years.
In May 2017, he had a severe fall and in September 2017 he died from the consequences of a hip fracture.

Liepkalnis Winter Sports Centre

Liepkalnis Winter Sports Centre is an alpine skiing area in Vilnius, Lithuania. It has 10 lifts and 9 groomed ski runs. All the pistes are lit and equipped with artificial snow making equipment. The centre is based on the highest point in Vilnius, Laimio kalnas, with a maximum altitude of above sea level. The maximum altitude difference on the hill is .
History.
The hill has been used by the alpine skiing enthusiasts since at least 1982, and it has been continually raised by piling rubble until 2000, mostly by efforts of the skiing enthusiast Laimis Janutėnas. Eventually people started calling the mountain by his name, and in 2004 the Vilnius City Municipality officially named the hill "Laimio kalnas". The first ski lift was launched in 1984.
In 2013, the control of the ski area was given to the Lithuanian-Latvian JSC "UAB "Trade State"", which invested around 1 million euros into lighting, snowmaking, snow grooming equipment and built multiple new lifts. Along with the lifts and snow grooming infrastructure, the company operates a ski school and a ski and snowboard rental service.

Craig an Eran

Craig an Eran (1918 – 1945) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He failed to win as a two-year-old but improved to become one of the best in England in 1921. He won the 2000 Guineas, St James's Palace Stakes and Eclipse Stakes as well as finishing second in the Epsom Derby and fourth in the St Leger. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion whose offspring included April the Fifth and Mon Talisman.
Background.
Craig an Eran was a bay horse bred in the United Kingdom by his owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. He was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire.
He was from the sixth crop of foals sired by Sunstar who won the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby in 1911 before his career was ended by injury. Craig an Eran's dam Maid of the Mist was a daughter of Sceptre and an influential broodmare in her own right, who also produced the Epsom Oaks winner Sunny Jane. Her other descendants have included Buchan, Commanche Run, Full Dress, Swiftfoot and One in a Million.
Racing career.
1920: two-year-old season.
Craig an Eran ran twice as a juvenile, beginning his track career by finishing second in the Salisbury Racecourse Foal Plate in spring. At Royal Ascot in June he finished unplaced behind Alan Breck in the New Stakes.
1921: three-year-old season.
On 29 April Craig an Eran (ridden by Jack Brennan) started at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16/1) in the 113rd running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse. Humorist started favourite while the best fancied of the other 24 runners included Monarch (Middle Park Stakes), Alan Beck, Polemarch and Lemonora. Inside the final furlong Humorist held the lead but the complexion of the race changed in the final strides as Craig an Eran and Lemonora overtook the leaders. Craig an Eran crossed the line three quarters of a length ahead of Lemonora with Humorist the same distance away in third. After the race the colt assumed the position of favourite in the ante-post betting for the Derby.
On 1 June Craig an Eran started 5/1 second favourite behind Leighton in a 23-runner field for the Epsom Derby. He produced a sustained run in the straight but was beaten a neck by Humorist after a "battle royal" with three lengths back to Lemonora in third. Frank Bullock, who had ridden the colt in 1920, took over from Brennan when Craig an Eran was dropped in distance for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and won at odds of 1/8. The form of the British Classic Races was franked in late June when Lemonora won the Grand Prix de Paris, the most valuable race in the world at that time. One day later however, it was announced that Humorist had died in his stable. On 15 July Craig an Eran was matched against older horses in the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Stakes and, with Bullock in the saddle, won at odds of 2/7 favourite. He was followed home by Braishfield (Sussex Stakes) and Pompadour (third in the 1000 Guineas), giving Alec Taylor a 1-2-3 in the race.
On 7 September Craig an Eran started 1/4 favourite for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse and was reportedly regarded as a "certainty". He moved up to dispute the lead in the straight but failed to stay and finished fourth behind Polemarch, Franklin and Westward Ho!. Excuses were offered for the colt's defeat: it was reported that Taylor had been unable to train the horse to peak fitness on the prevailing hard ground and that Craig an Eran had been bumped by Westward Ho! in the straight. The latter claim was refuted by the jockeys involved in an enquiry by the racecourse stewards.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Craig an Eran an "average" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
Craig an Eran remained in training as a four-year-old but in April 1922 it was decided to retire the colt from racing and put him to stud at fee of 250 guineas. He was employed a breeding stallion in England, before moving to France. The best of his offspring included April the Fifth, Mon Talisman and the Grand Prix de Paris winner Admiral Drake. Craig an Eran was euthanised on 22 October 1945.

Carmen Brussig

Carmen Brussig (20 May 1977) is a German judoka who has won numerous tournaments including Paralympic and world championship gold.
Brussig was born in Leipzig with visual impairments and competes in B2 classification events. She made her Paralympic debut at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, winning a bronze medal in the under 48 kg weight class. She lost in the quarterfinal to Russian judoka Victoria Potapova but won the repechage against Cuban Maria Gonzalez to claim the bronze. Four years later, in the London Games, Brussig claimed gold by beating Potapova in the quarterfinal and Yuliya Halinska in the semifinal. This put Brussig into the final for the first time where she faced and defeated Lee Kai Lin. When defending her title at the 2016 Games in Rio de Janeiro she won the semifinal against Halinska but then lost in the final to world champion Li Liqing, earning herself a silver medal.
Brussig's judoka career outside the Paralympic Games has also seen her achieve great successes. She has won eight international tournaments between 2001 and 2014, along with six silver and three bronze medals. Brussig lives in Switzerland and competes in national Swiss tournaments, finishing in the top three eight times between 2005 and 2014. In 2015 she won the world championship in her weight category for the third time, having achieved the same feat in 2006 and 2007.
Brussig is 15 minutes older than her identical twin sister, Ramona Brussig, also a medal-winning judoka. The pair won Paralympic gold within 15 minutes of each other in London 2012, with Ramona competing in the heavier under 52 weight category. Both sisters are listed amongst the most promising German medal candidates for the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, resulting in them being given financial support in their endeavours.
Brussig trained as a pastry chef until her visual impairments stopped her from continuing with that career.

Ramona Brussig

Ramona Brussig (20 May 1977) is a German judoka and two-time gold medal winner in Paralympic competition. She was born in Leipzig with visual impairments meaning that she competes in B2 classification events. Brussig has an identical twin sister, Carmen Brussig, also a gold-medal-winning visually-impaired judoka, who was born 15 minutes before her. Brussig began training in 1986 at the age of nine and made her senior international debut in 1998 at the World Games in Madrid. Though her sister lives in Switzerland, the pair like to meet up and train together when they can. They say that they do not have a sense of rivalry as they compete in different weight classes.
Brussig won gold in the under 57 kg weight class at the 2004 Games in Athens, her first Paralympic Games, against Spanish judoka Marta Arce Payno. She then won silver four years later in Beijing, losing to Wang Lijing in the final. Brussig and Wang both dropped down a weight class to under 52 kg for the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, meeting each other again in the final. This time Brussig was triumphant, going home with the gold. Brussig defended her title at the Rio 2016 and finished as runner-up to French judoka Sandrine Martinet, earning her a silver medal.
Through her career Brussig has won four world titles and six European titles. She says that one of her most treasured memories was winning gold in London just 15 minutes after her twin sister achieved the same feat. Both sisters are listed amongst the most promising German medal candidates for the 2020 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo, resulting in them being given financial support in their endeavours.
Brussig works for the sports association of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, a state in northern Germany.

Statue of Frederick Douglass (College Park, Maryland)

Frederick Douglass is a public artwork in front of the Hornbake Library at the University of Maryland in College Park, Maryland. The statue memorializes African-American abolitionist, suffragist, and labor leader Frederick Douglass.
Description and history.
Unveiled in 2015, the statue was designed by sculptor Andrew Edwards, who was inspired by artwork representing then-president Barack Obama and Moses. The statue portrays Douglass in the middle of a speech, with one arm outstretched, and a copy of his autobiography under the other arm. The square surrounding the statue features stone pavers and a vertical Corten steel wall with Douglass' words inscribed on them. The cast bronze statue was designed in Ireland and cast in Wales. It stands on a 3-foot-tall base and weighs nearly half a ton. Kenneth B. Morris, Jr., Douglass' great-great-great grandson, said that "I love that the statue shows him in his fiery abolitionist years."
The statue was the result of years of efforts on the part of campus leaders to honor this important Marylander and to reaffirm commitment to social justice. History professor Ira Berlin was part of this group, who called themselves the North Stars after the abolitionist newspaper Douglass edited. According to Berlin, "The vision of myself and the North Stars was to have Frederick Douglass on campus to speak to the question of social justice." Efforts to raise the more than half a million dollars for the square and the statue began in 2011. The statue itself cost $200,000.

State Islamic University of North Sumatra

State Islamic University of North Sumatra (Bahasa Indonesia: "Universitas Islam Negeri (UIN) Sumatera Utara", abbreviated as UINSU) is a state Islamic university located in the large city of Medan, North Sumatra, and is the only state Islamic university in North Sumatra.
Like most of "State Islamic University", State Islamic University of North Sumatra is also a college education provider in addition to Islamic studies.
History.
When IAIN of North Sumatra was established in 1973, its main mission was to serve as an Islamic university institution that transmitted Islamic knowledge in the sense of 'ulûm dîniyyah. Along with the knowledge development and the needs of national development, then in the era of the 1990s, IAIN SU entered a new phase which was characterized by the provision of a wider mandate. Furthermore, entering the era of the 2000s, IAIN SU enters a more developed stage that is not just a wider mandate, but also has to lead to scientific integration. This development was then followed up by the transfer of institutional status of IAIN of North Sumatra to State Islamic University of North Sumatra (Universitas Islam Negeri Sumatera Utara). Furthermore, it is in line with this change that the study of knowledge at IAIN has changed from monodiscipliner to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary. Thus, the vision and mission of knowledge in UIN SU has also been changed, in accordance with the changes and the development of present social life. From a paradigm point of view, UIN SU uses the living system as a paradigm master, which aims to expand ideas and simplifies the process of combining different kinds of knowledge into one container.

Jane Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (1798–1844)

Jane Spencer-Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough (29 March 1798 – 12 October 1844), formerly Lady Jane Stewart, was the first wife of George Spencer-Churchill, 6th Duke of Marlborough.
Jane was the daughter of George Stewart, 8th Earl of Galloway, and his wife, the former Lady Jane Paget, and was the first cousin of George Spencer-Churchill, whose mother had been Jane's father's sister.
She married the duke, then Marquess of Blandford, on 13 January 1819. It was the future duke's first legal marriage, though he had previously gone through a false marriage ceremony (with his brother, Lord Charles Spencer-Churchill, playing the role of clergyman) and had then lived as husband and wife in Scotland with the 16-year-old Susannah Adelaide Law, which might have made the marriage legal under Scottish law. Blandford had successfully contested the matter in court, even though she had a child by him. His mother was obliged to pay Susannah an allowance in order to prevent her making public his letters. He had also had an affair with Elizabeth Conyngham, Marchioness Conyngham.
They had four children:
Blandford inherited his father's dukedom in 1840.
The duchess died at Blenheim Palace, aged 46. The duke remarried a further twice, with more children from each marriage.

Joaquin Avila (lawyer)

Joaquin Guadalupe Avila (June 23, 1948 – March 9, 2018) was an American voting rights attorney and activist. Avila spent more than two decades using the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965 to increase election fairness for minority voters. But as several court precedents weakened the federal Voting Rights Act, Avila conceived of state voting rights acts as a way to again strengthen minority voting rights. Thus Avila crafted the California Voting Rights Act that was enacted in 2001.
Avila brought lawsuits that set important voting rights precedents. He also served as president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and directed the National Voting Rights Advocacy Initiative at Seattle University School of Law. Among the many honors he received recognizing his work, he was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1996.
Early life and education.
Joaquin Guadalupe Avila was born in Los Angeles, California and grew up in Compton. His father was a foundry worker. He earned his B.A. in political science at Yale University in 1970 and received his J.D. degree from Harvard University Law School in 1973. He was an editor of the "Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review".
Career.
After obtaining his law degree, Avila worked briefly on voting rights litigation in California before relocating to Texas. There, Avila worked as a staff attorney for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and quickly rose in the organization, eventually becoming its president and general counsel. He served as president and general counsel of MALDEF from 1982 to 1985, during which he had a hand in over 70 voting rights cases.
After leaving MALDEF, Avila moved to Fremont, California where he successfully argued important voting right cases, including "Gomez v. the City of Watsonville", in which the city's at-large elections for city council diluted the voting power of the city's Latino residents in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965. He successfully argued two voting rights cases before the United States Supreme Court.
Avila drafted the 2001 California Voting Rights Act (CVRA), which made it easier for plaintiffs to challenge at-large election systems by eliminating one of the criteria required to challenge such systems under the federal Voting Rights Act. 
The law also required the government to pay the legal fees of plaintiffs who successfully challenge an election system under the law.
In 2003 he authored a UCLA law school report which called for the amendment of the state constitution to allow millions of non-citizen adults to vote in local elections.
Avila later served as practitioner in residence and director of the National Voting Rights Advocacy Initiative at the Seattle University School of Law.
Awards and honors.
Avila's work has been recognized by awards that include:
Personal life.
Avila was married to Sally Cabaruvias, and lived in Compton, 
California, with whom he had three children, Joaquin Jr., Salvador and Angelique He died of cancer at his home in Shoreline, Washington.

Silvia Levenson

Silvia Levenson (born 1957, in Buenos Aires, Argentina) is a contemporary artist and political activist working in glass. Originally a graphic artist in her native Argentina whose work, both artistic and political, was in direct conflict with the dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla, she found herself and her young family immigrating to Italy in 1980. Glass soon became the new medium in which she could best express her feelings of exile, oppression and personal tragedy.
Biography.
Silvia Levenson was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1957. Born into a time when political and social activism was encouraged, she began protesting on behalf of the Buenos Aires poor as early as 14. By the time she was 16 she was married and before her 20th birthday she was a mother. It was during this time that the political climate in Argentina began to change with the military taking control of the government under Jorge Rafael Videla, the senior commander of the Argentine Army. Between 1976 and 1984 more than 30,000 people disappeared and were later killed, including members of Levenson's own family. At the age of 23 she fled to Italy with her husband and family. It was the tragic events of this time that ultimately influenced and continues to influence Levenson's artistic practice.

Horace Marryat

Horace Marryat (1818–1887) was an English traveller and author.
Horace Marryat was a son of the businessman Joseph Marryat (1757–1824). His father maintained extended holdings in the West Indies, and made a fortune from colonial goods.
After his father died, being the youngest of the children in the family, he left England in the 1840s, setting out for his many travels.
With his wife Mathilda Elisabeth Somerset, daughter of Lord Edward Somerset, Marryat spent time in France, Italy, and Denmark. In 1860, he published "A Residence in Jutland, the Danish Isles and Copenhagen". He went on travelling in Sweden, notably spending time at the manse of Johan Börjesson, preparing his subsequent travelogue. In 1862, he published "One Year in Sweden" (published 1862; Swedish translation 1863), based in his impressions and findings while staying with the family.
In 1863, Marryat's daughter Ida married the Swedish Count , after which Horace Marryat and his wife would spend their summers at Hörningsholm Castle in Södermanland.

Christian Lorenzi

Christian Lorenzi (born April 15, 1968) is Professor of Experimental Psychology at École Normale Supérieure in Paris, France, where he has been Director of the Department of Cognitive Studies and Director of Scientific Studies until. Lorenzi works on auditory perception.
Biography.
Lorenzi obtained a PhD in experimental psychology from Université Lyon 2 in 1995 for his work on "Codage de la modulation d'amplitude dans le système auditif: expériences psychoacoustiques et modélisation physiologique" (coding of amplitude modulation in the auditory system: psychoacoustical experiments and physiological modelling). He then spent a year as a postdoc at the Applied Psychology Unit in Cambridge, UK, where he worked with Roy D. Patterson on the perception of temporally asymetric envelopes and click trains. The following year, he moved to the Glasgow branch of the MRC Institute of Hearing Research where he worked with Stuart Gatehouse.
Back in France, he became Lecturer (Maître de Conférences) at the Université Paris Descartes. He obtained his "Habilitation à Diriger les Recherches" in 2000 and became Professor in 2001. During this period, he is a member of the Laboratoire de Psychologie de la Perception where he worked on the creation of the Équipe Audition which becomes physically located at the ENS. In 2011, his affiliation officially changed to the École Normale Supérieure, where he was Director of Scientific Studies until 2020.
Lorenzi became a fellow of the Acoustical Society of America in 2008.
Research.
Sounds such as speech, music and natural soundscapes are decomposed by the peripheral auditory system of humans (the cochlea) into narrow frequency bands. The resulting signals convey information at different time scales to more central auditory structures. A dichotomy between slow "temporal envelope" cues and faster "temporal fine structure" (TFS) cues has been proposed to explore several aspects of auditory perception including speech intelligibility in quiet or against competing sound sources.
Starting from the late nineties, Lorenzi conducted a research program on auditory perception combining signal processing, psychophysical, electrophysiological and computational methods based on this envelope/TFS dichotomy. He examined the role of these two cues in sound discrimination and auditory scene analysis, how these cues are processed at each stage of the auditory system, and the effects of peripheral (cochlear) or central damage, development, ageing and rehabilitation systems (e.g., hearing aids or cochlear implants) on the perception of these temporal envelope and TFS cues.
His early work on the perception of temporal-envelope information corroborated the existence of tuned (selective) modulation filters at central stages of the human auditory system, consistent with the notion that the auditory system computes some form of modulation spectrum of incoming sounds. He then showed that dynamic information in sounds not only is carried by so-called first-order characteristic of sounds (e.g., onset and offset cues, slow amplitude modulations composing the envelope of sounds), but also can be carried by “second-order” characteristics such as variations in the temporal-envelope contrast (modulation depth). His psychophysical conducted on normal-hearing people and patients with cochlear or brain lesions is consistent with the idea that, as in vision, nonlinear mechanisms along the auditory pathway generate an audible distortion component at the 2nd-order AM frequency in the internal modulation spectrum of sounds.
His more recent work on the perception of TFS information suggested that TFS cues convey as much spectro-temporal information as temporal-envelope cues do for complex sounds such as speech. He also showed that TFS cues are less vulnerable than temporal envelope cues when sounds are masked by competing sounds such as noise or presented at high intensities, and may play a role in robust sound coding at the low (brainstem) level. His work conducted with people with sensorineural hearing loss and computational models of auditory perception showed how cochlear lesions may alter the neural representation of TFS cues in the early stages of the auditory system, even in regions of the pure-tone audiogram where hearing is clinically considered as normal.

Singularity (Jon Hopkins album)

Singularity is the fifth studio album by English electronic musician and producer Jon Hopkins, released on 4 May 2018 through Domino Records.
It was announced on 6 March 2018, with the release of the first single, "Emerald Rush". The second single, "Everything Connected", was released on 25 April, while the third, "Singularity", was released on 4 May, along with the album.
The album follows Hopkins's companion previous album, "Immunity". It was released to critical acclaim and was nominated at the 2019 Grammy Awards for Best Dance/Electronic Album.
Critical reception.
"Singularity" received widespread acclaim from critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". It received critical acclaim from a few publications including "NME", and "The Skinny", who each attributed it a perfect score.
"musicOMH" gave the album high praise, saying: "From the beginning this is music that sweeps the listener away, an aural massage that takes care of the hair standing on end at the top of the head to the pair of heels itching to start moving on the dance floor." "XLR8R" compared the album to Hopkins' previous album "Immunity", saying: "Hopkins' merging of emotional material with hypnotic, physical grooves appeared effortless. Singularity continues in the vein of Immunity, though its depth of feeling is greater, and rhythmic power more potent." AllMusic was more positive of "Singularity" than Hopkins' previous album "Immunity", stating: "...filled with frayed feedback, skillfully crafted beats, and gentle piano melodies, as well as the occasional breathy vocals. This time out, there seems to be an extra shot of adrenaline added, and the album seems to reflect a deeper spiritual quest, both inwards and outwards." Stephen Carlick of "Exclaim!" praised the album saying, "It's an album that, in its best moments, finds one of electronic music's great minds operating in peak form."
"The Observer" was critical of the album, saying: "Too often, though, you’re left wishing for the thuggish bass and head-severing hi-hats of less cerebral dance music. There’s not enough food for the brain or fuel for the feet here".

Comité Central des Houillères de France

The Comité Central des Houillères de France (CCHF, Central Committee of Coalowners of France) was an industrial lobby group that represented the interests of the owners of coal mines.
It was active between 1887 and 1940, when the Vichy government dissolved it and placed the coal industry under government control.
Origins.
A first attempt to unite the coalowners of the Loire region to defend their common interests was made in 1822, but did not last. 
The Union des Houillères françaises was formed in 1840 to promote the interests of the national mines and defend their common interests.
It had a committee supported by a secretary in Paris who maintained records and responded to requests.
The union also did not last long. 
The Comité des Houillères Françaises was organized from 1855 to 1869 by Amédée Burat (1809–83), a professor at the École Centrale Paris and consulting engineer to the Blanzy and Le Creusot mines.
This committee provided a center for publications.
During the French Third Republic a period of prosperity for the coal mines ended after 1880 and the need for an industry organization reappeared. 
The Compagnie des Mines de la Loire set up a study committee on 1 July 1886 to review mining laws.
Henry Darcy (1840–1926)(), president of the Châtillon-Commentry, Blanzy() and Dourges() companies, created the Comité Central des Houillères (CCHF) at the study committee's general assembly on 10 March 1887 through an expansion of that committee's powers. 
The purpose was to defend the interests of the French coal mining companies.
History.
The statutes of the CCHF were adopted in 1888 and provided for a president, permanent staff, secretary general, and a monthly meeting of all member companies with one representative per company.
The head office was in Paris. 
It moved several times before 1897 when it was established at 55 rue de Chateaudun. 
In 1922 it moved to 35 rue Saint-Dominique, where it remained until the committee was dissolved in 1940.
The statutes were modified in 1892, 1913, 1924 and 1931, but the general organization and objectives did not change. 
The committee had just two presidents: Henry Darcy from 1888 to 1925, then Henri de Peyerimhoff from 1925 to 1940. 
Under Peyerimhoff the committee had a staff of eighteen in Paris.
The CCHF canvassed its members for subjects of interest, and circulated printed reports on laws and regulations, technical innovations, legal judgements in cases involving mining and so on.
The CCHF does not appear to have had the same influence on the coal industry as that of the Comité des forges on metallurgy.
Its main role was to resist pressure from the government or the unions, and it did not have power over its own members.
It was only in the 1930s that it began to resemble the German cartels, but the member companies still maintained their independence.
The CCHF was particularly involved in revisions to the mining laws, where it was often able to influence parliament in its favour through discreet and carefully calculated influence on politicians and senior ministry staff.
The CCHF occasionally used press campaigns to influence the public.
It emerged that the CCHF and the Comite de Forges were managers of "Le Temps", the most authoritative newspaper of the Third Republic.
After the 1940 defeat of France in World War II, the Vichy government targeted the CCHF, Comité de Forges and Confédération générale du patronat français (CGPF), three organizations closely identified with the "grand patronat" of France.
The organizations were dissolved and their leaders were excluded from the successor organization committees.
The decree dissolving the CCHF was issued by the Petain government on 9 November 1940, and another decree on the same date placed the mining industry under state control.
The CCHF was replaced by the Comité d’organisation des combustibles minéraux solides.
In 1944 the Director of Mines took over and supervised the nationalization of the coal mines and creation of the Charbonnages de France by law of 17 April 1946.
Key people.
Henry Darcy (1840–1926) started his career in 1863 in the Council of State, and was a prefect in several departments in 1873–77.
He became chairman of the board of the Compagnie des Forges de Châtillon-Commentry et Neuves-Maisons in 1870, holding this office until his death.
He was a member of the management committee of the Comité des Forges de France.
In 1918 he was a co-founder of the Confédération générale de la production française.
In 1907 Henri de Peyerimhoff (1871–1953) was appointed Secretary General of the CCHF in place of Édouard Gruner, who now concentrated on technical subjects.
Peyerimhoff was then in turn secretary general, vice president and from 1925 president of the committee until it was dissolved.
In 1928 he wrote favorably about collective agreements in an article on "Le Program Patronal" in the "Revue des Vivants".
Peyerimhoff defended the collieries against electricity and steel interests.
He was interested in subjects such as trade unionism, workers' housing, social care for workers' children and controlled recruitment of Polish workers for French mines.
Member companies.
Founding companies (or their locations) were: 
No companies are known to have left the CCHF, although some disappeared through mergers and acquisitions.
Most new French coal mining companies asked for admission.
The 39 original companies rose to 100 in 1908 and 134 in 1934, then fell to 78 in 1938.
Apart from the Société Mokta El Hadid, metal mines did not seek representation.
From 1909 they had their own Chambre syndicale française des mines métalliques.
The CCHF exchanged information with this organization and sometimes worked with it in public actions.

Llewellyn-class minesweeper

The "Llewellyn"-class minesweepers were a series of ten coastal minesweepers constructed for the Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War. Based on the Admiralty type , the "Llewellyn" class were constructed of wood and used for the removal of magnetic influence mines. Two were built in Quebec, with the eight constructed on the Western Coast of Canada. Mostly used as guard ships during the war, only three of the ten remained in Royal Canadian Navy service following the war, with the last being discarded in 1957. Following naval service, vessels of the class ended up in commercial service, with some becoming fishing vessels, cargo ships and one a floating restaurant. Six of the ten ships were lost in commercial service.
Description.
Based on the Admiralty type s, the "Llewellyn" class were built with wooden hulls for deployment against magnetic influence mines that would detect a steel hull passing nearby and detonate. The minesweepers had a standard displacement of . They were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . The "Llewellyn" class were powered by a diesel engine driving one propeller shaft, rated at . This gave the minesweepers a maximum speed of .
The "Llewellyn" class were armed with four machine guns placed in two twin mounts. At some point, their armament was changed to one 0.5-inch machine gun placed amidships and twin machine guns on the bridge wings. The minesweepers were equipped with the "Double L" magnetic minesweeping gear and had a complement of 23 composed of 3 officers and 20 crew.
Service history.
The first two vessels of the class were constructed at Île d'Orléans, Quebec. "Llewellyn" and "Lloyd George" were both commissioned on 24 August 1942 at Quebec City and escorted a convoy from Quebec City to Sydney, Nova Scotia before arriving at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Both vessels' names begin with a double "l", a reflection of their minesweeping gear. They would be the only two vessels that began their names as such, as the eight minesweepers constructed in British Columbia did not follow this pattern.
During the Second World War, "Llewellyn" and "Lloyd George" operated out of Halifax performing sweeps of the approaches to Halifax Harbour. Following the war, "Llewellyn" became the guard ship for the Royal Canadian Navy reserve fleet at Halifax. Taken out of service on 14 June 1946. "Llewellyn" was recommissioned on 25 July 1949 as tender at Saint John, New Brunswick associated with the naval reserve division , primarily used for training. That summer, the ship made a tour of Newfoundland, after it became the 10th province of Canada. "Llewellyn" was tender to in 1951. The ship was decommissioned again on 31 October 1951. Sold 1957 for commercial use. Renamed "Llewellyn II", the fishing vessel foundered off Cape Breton Island on 28 October 1960. Following war, "Lloyd George" was used as a bathythermograph survey vessel until 16 July 1948 when the ship was decommissioned. "Lloyd George" was sold on 14 May 1951 to become a floating restaurant at Bridgewater, Nova Scotia. The hulk was abandoned ten years later.
The British Columbia-built minesweepers all joined the fleet in 1944 and patrolled between Esquimalt and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, joining either escort force until the end of 1945. All eight were decommissioned and seven were sold to commercial interests. The vast majority of them had eventful fates. "Daerwood" was sold for commercial use on 30 December 1946. The vessel caught fire and sank at Bridgetown, Barbados on 13 October 1973. "Cranbrook" was purchased by a Nanaimo towing firm in November 1947. In 1950 the vessel's registry disappeared from Lloyd's Registry. "Coquitlam" was sold in October 1946 and renamed "Wilcox". The ship went aground on 17 June 1954 on Anticosti Island and written off. "Kalamalka" was sold in 1946 for conversion to a fishing vessel. The ship burned and sank while fishing in Wallis Bay, British Columbia on 18 March 1968. "Lavallee" was sold on 13 November 1947 to become fishing vessel of the same name. The ship burned and sank near Burgeo, Newfoundland and Labrador on 1 March 1967. "Rossland" was sold to Vancouver towing company in 1946 and renamed "La Verne". In 1971, the vessel was resold to a US buyer. "St. Joseph" was sold for commercial use and was a Mexican-flagged cargo vessel until the ship's registry was deleted in 1988.
"Revelstoke" was the only British Columbia-built vessel to be kept following the war. "Revelstoke" sailed to Halifax and served as tender to HMCS "Stadacona" and before being decommissioned for the final time on 23 October 1953. The vessel was sold in 1957 and renamed "Shirley Ann" in 1959. "Shirley Ann" caught fire and sank off Newfoundland on 12 October 1979.

1985 British Open

The 1985 British Open (also known as the 1985 Dulux British Open due to sponsorship) was a professional ranking snooker tournament, that was held from 17 February to 3 March 1985 with television coverage on ITV beginning on 22 February from the Assembly Rooms in Derby, England. It was the first edition of the British Open, having been rebranded from the International Open the previous year. It was the fifth ranking event of the 1984–85 snooker season, preceding the 1985 World Snooker Championship.
In the best-of-23- final, South African player Silvino Francisco defeated Canadian Kirk Stevens 12–9. It was the first major professional snooker tournament without a British player in the final. The event featured a total prize fund of £250,000 with the winner receiving £50,000. The highest of the event was made by Alex Higgins, who compiled a 142 in his last-16 match against Cliff Thorburn.
Overview.
The 1985 British Open was held between 17 February and 3 March 1985. The qualifying competition took place across venues in London, Bristol and Stockport. The first round took place at the Connaught Club in London and the Bradbury Hall in Chesterfield between 14 and 17 January 1985, whilst the remaining rounds took place at the Assembly Rooms, Derby. The qualifying and first rounds were played as best-of-11 . The following rounds, from last 32 to quarter-finals, were played as shorter best-of-9-frames matches because of television scheduling. Broadcaster ITV were concerned about the prospect of large overtime payments for their staff if matches overran, and also requested that the afternoon matches started at 2:00 pm rather than the originally scheduled 1:00 pm, to avoid higher payments to lighting technicians that would have been due if the lighting was switched on before that time. The decision by snooker governing body the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) to cut the length of matches in response to ITV's request was publicly criticised by WPBSA board member Barry Hearn, who was also the manager of prominent player Steve Davis.
The event was sponsored by ICI Paints Division and was known for sponsorship purposes as the 1985 Dulux British Open. It took the place of the non-ranking 1984 International Masters tournament on the professional snooker calendar.
Prize fund.
The prize fund for the event was £250,000, with the winner receiving £50,000.
Tournament summary.
In the first round, Bill Werbeniuk, 14th in the world rankings, was beaten 1–6 by Bob Chaperon. Malcolm Bradley, in his first season as a professional player, beat David Taylor 6–3. Bob Harris, who to that point had made little impact as a player, beat world number six Eddie Charlton 6–3 after being 1–3 behind. Jimmy White was 3–1 ahead of Tony Jones but the match went to the deciding frame before White won, 6–5. Another first-year professional, Danny Fowler, beat Rex Williams, the former world billiards champion, 6–3. A third new professional, Tony Chappel, led reigning world champion Steve Davis 5–4, before Davis prevailed 6–5.
The television stages of the event began in the second round. Steve Newbury, in his first season as a professional player, recorded a 5–3 win over former world champion Terry Griffiths in the last 32. Other players unexpectedly losing in the second round were Willie Thorne, who lost 0–5 to Murdo MacLeod; Ray Reardon, who was wearing spectacles for the first time in a match and who was beaten 4–5 by Dave Martin after leading 4–1; and Jimmy White, who lost 4–5 to Silvino Francisco. Only seven of the top sixteen seeded players progressed into the last 16 of the competition. In the last 16, Alex Higgins was level at 2–2 with Cliff Thorburn, then made a total clearance of 142, the highest break of the tournament, and went on to win 5–2. In the match between Eugene Hughes and Murdo MacLeod, neither player made a break of 30 or over as Hughes won 5–2.
Kirk Stevens won his quarter-final against Dennis Taylor by winning five straight frames after trailing 0–2, and went on to beat Davis 9–7 in the semi-final to reach his first ranking tournament final. In the other semi-final, Francisco was never behind Higgins in frames, and won 9–7. With the South African Francisco and the Canadian Stevens contesting the final, it was the first snooker ranking tournament where there was no British player in the final. The next time there was a ranking final with no British players was the 2009 Grand Prix.

The final was played across three sessions, with an afternoon and evening session on Saturday 2 March followed by a session on Sunday 3 March. Francisco took a 5–0 lead in the final, before Stevens won the last two frames of the first session to make it 5–2. In the second session, Francisco increased his lead to 6–2 with a on the in the eighth frame. A few frames later, he made his lead 9–4 due to another fluked pink ball. In the frame following this, Stevens compiled the highest break of the final, 108, which left Francisco 9–5 ahead at the end of the first day. The following day, Stevens took the first three frames of the third session of the final to trail by just one frame. However, Francisco won the next two frames to lead 11–8. Stevens won frame 20 from 47 points behind, but Francisco took the next to gain victory. The winner's prize money of £50,000 was a new record amount for snooker tournaments.

Patti Kusturok

Patti Kusturok (Lamoureux) is a Canadian fiddler, performer, teacher, and composer who is known as "Canada's old-time fiddling sweetheart." She resides in Winnipeg, Manitoba where she teaches fiddling. She performs frequently in addition to teaching at workshops and music camps each summer. She has taught at the Emma Lake Fiddle Camp, Shivering Strings Fiddle Camp in Winnipeg, and Falcon Lake Fiddle Camp. Her son, Alex Kusturok is also a champion fiddler.
Kusturok began playing fiddle at age four according to the Suzuki Method. Her playing is characterized by a pulsating, rhythmical lilt and often referred to as one of the "smoothest fiddle players in North America." Patti has attributed her playing style to having a loose bowing wrist and allowing her fingers to move on the bow as she is playing. Her style is described as part Métis and part Québecois. Her musical influences include Calvin Vollrath, Reg Bouvette and Graham Townsend. Lamoureux explained to CBC SCENE host Bruce Ladan (CBC Manitoba) that she has learned a lot about playing the fiddle by teaching it. After she mastered the instrument, she started teaching when she was 16 years old, taking over for her teacher when he retired. "Being kind of a natural player and not having trouble learning, it was great to learn that other people don't always learn that way," she recalled. "So I learned how to teach by teaching. People would ask me why my bowing arm was so smooth. I had to analyze how I gripped it, as well as the pressure, that kind of thing."
In 2015 she published 365 videos of herself playing a new fiddle tune every day in an event called "Patti Kusturok's 365 Days of Fiddle Tunes." In 2019, Kusturok published an additional 365 videos of herself playing a new fiddle tune every day in an event titled "2019-Patti Kusturok's 365 Days of Fiddle Tunes."

AAA Indoor Championships

The AAA Indoor Championships was an annual indoor track and field competition organised by the Amateur Athletic Association of England. It was the foremost indoor domestic athletics event during its lifetime.
The event was first held in 1935, following the construction of an adequate venue in Wembley Arena in London for the 1934 British Empire Games. The first iteration of the competition lasted for five editions and featured around nine men's indoor track and field events and six for women. The onset of World War II meant the competition was not held in 1940. The second iteration of the competition began in 1962, returning to its Wembley venue. The championships had a long residency at RAF Cosford indoor arena from 1965 to 1991, then from 1992 to 2001 at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. The final few editions for held at the English Institute of Sport, Sheffield. The event ceased in 2006, being replaced by the UK Athletics-organised British Indoor Athletics Championships.
Though organised by the English governing body, it was open to all athletes from the United Kingdom, and also to overseas athletes. (Most of the foreign athletes who competed were Irish or UK-based.) It served as the de facto British Championships, given the absence of such a competition during its history. It was typically held over two days over a weekend in February.
It was among the earliest and most significant annual indoor track and field competitions, being preceded only by the AAU Indoor Track and Field Championships in the United States (established in 1907). The restarting of the AAA Indoor Championships in 1962 came alongside similar national developments elsewhere, including the German Indoor Championships in 1954 and Soviet Indoors in 1964. The European Athletics Indoor Championships became the first regular indoor international championship in 1966.
Events.
The following athletics events featured as standard on the main AAA Championships programme:
Events were initially raced and measured in imperial distances, with the transition to metric occurring in 1968 for men and 1969 for women. A men's 2000 metres steeplechase was contested from 1967 to 1985. Combined track and field events were introduced in 1987 in the form of a men's octathlon and a women's pentathlon; the octathlon was amended to the international standard men's heptathlon in 1991. Racewalking briefly featured on the programme, with a men's and women's 3000 metres track walk happening from 1997 to 2002. A women's 1.5 mile walk was also held in 1966 and 1967. and a men's 1-mile walk in 1936. The non-standard 600-yard run was held for both men and women from 1962 to 1964.
In line with the international expansion of women's athletics programmes to match the men's, the 3000 metres for women was added in 1973, the triple jump was added in 1991 and the pole vault in 1994.

Clifford B. Drake

Clifford Barnes Drake (November 7, 1918 – October 25, 1994) was a highly decorated officer of the United States Marine Corps with the rank of major general. He served as an artillery officer during World War II and later took part in the Vietnam War as deputy commander of XXIV Corps.
Early career and World War II.
Clifford B. Drake was born on November 7, 1918, in New York City, but his family moved to Los Angeles, California, where he attended high school in 1935 and then the University of California (UCLA), earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in Physics in June 1940. While at UCLA, he was a member of a Reserve Officers' Training Corps unit and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Reserve Corps.
Drake resigned his reserve rank in order to accept an appointment as second lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps on July 1, 1940. He was sent to Officer Candidates School at Quantico, Virginia, for further officer education. After a three-months course there, he was attached to the Marine detachment aboard the battleship USS "California".
While serving on the "California", Drake was present at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack. He was officer of the deck on that day and was relieved by Ensign Herbert C. Jones around 7:30 am. Drake went for breakfast and heard explosions and the engines of the attacking Japanese aircraft 20 minutes later. The general quarters alarm then summoned the crew to battle stations, and Drake went to the foretop of the ship, where he directed its defense. Ensign Jones was later killed by a bomb explosion and received the Congressional Medal of Honor for his actions on "California".
The damaged and partially flooded "California" settled into the mud with only her superstructure remaining above the surface. Drake was subsequently transferred to 3rd Defense Battalion under Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Pepper and continued in the defense of Pearl Harbor. He showed great organizational skills and was promptly promoted to the rank of first lieutenant following the attack.
Drake was then attached to the Marine detachment aboard the transport ship USS "Argonne" for a brief period, before he was posted to the staff of Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley, Commander, South Pacific Area. While in this capacity, Drake was promoted to the rank of captain in May 1942 and also served in this command under Admiral William Halsey during the Solomon Islands campaign.
He was ordered back to the United States in early 1943 in order to attend the Army Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. He completed the course in June 1943 and was promoted to the rank of major at the same time. Ordered to Camp Pendleton, California, he was attached to the newly activated 14th Marine Artillery Regiment as executive officer of 1st Battalion. His regiment was subsequently attached to the newly created 4th Marine Division under Major General Harry Schmidt as its main artillery component. The 14th Marines later relocated to Camp Dunlap for further training and Drake received word of its upcoming combat deployment to the Pacific: the Marshall Islands.
The main target of the landing for the 4th Marine Division, was Roi Namur atoll, which served as a large air base and center of air activity in the Marshall Islands. With the securing of that atoll, Allied forces would have a new base for future offensives in the Pacific. Drake and his 1st Battalion deployed their 75mm Howitzers on the island of Ennubirr in the evening of January 31, 1944. They landed on Blue Beach 4 at 5:00pm and provided support fire for the advancing Allied units. The atoll was declared secure on February 2 and 1st Battalion was ordered to serve as a garrison unit until February 29.
The 1st Battalion then rejoined rest of the regiment, which had in the interim been ordered to Maui, Hawaii, for rest and further training. In mid-May, the 14th Marines were ordered back to the combat area, when they received orders for the forthcoming assault on Saipan in the Marianas. Drake landed with his battalion on Yellow Beach and participated in combat against enemy until July 9, 1944.
Following the capture of Saipan, the 4th Marine Division was ordered to take part in the landing on near Tinian on July 24. The 1st Battalion was the first artillery unit ashore and immediately commenced a barrage of gunfire. During the morning of the following day, Japanese artillery hit the command post of the 1st Battalion and almost wiped out the unit's command structure, including its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Harry J. Zimmer.
Drake took charge and supervised the evacuation of wounded and dead. He reestablished the battalion's command post and continued in its mission, providing artillery support to the 25th Marine Regiment. He led the battalion until the end of hostilities on August 1 and subsequently returned to Maui, Hawaii during the first week of August. For his actions on 25 July, when the battalion's command post was shelled, Drake received the Legion of Merit with Combat "V" and Navy Presidential Unit Citation.
While in Hawaii, Drake assumed command of the 2nd Battalion, 14th Marines and took part in several ship-to-shore maneuvers until January 27, 1945. The 2nd Battalion subsequently sailed for its new destination, Iwo Jima.
Drake went ashore with his battalion in the evening on February 19, 1945, and immediately deployed his howitzers. which began firing the same evening during the advance of the 25th Marines. Drake was later decorated with the Bronze Star Medal with Combat "V" for his service on Iwo Jima. He also received the Navy Unit Commendation.
Postwar service.
The 14th Marines returned to the United States in October 1945 and following the disbandment of the regiment at the end of November of that year, Drake was transferred to the Marine Corps Base San Diego, where he remained until April 1946. He was subsequently ordered to nearby Coronado Base, as an artillery instructor within Troop Training Unit, Pacific Fleet under Major General Harry K. Pickett. He later served as assistant chief of staff for personnel within this command.
Drake was transferred to Washington, D.C., in March 1948 and appointed administrative assistant and aide to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arthur W. Radford. He continued in this capacity under Admirals John D. Price and Lynde D. McCormick and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel in August 1949.
He also earned a Master of Arts degree in education from Stanford University in June 1951 and subsequently joined the 2nd Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. Drake served under Major General Edwin A. Pollock as assistant chief of staff for personnel and then as commander of the 4th and later 3rd Battalions, 10th Marine Regiment. He finished his tenure with the 10th Marines as regimental operations officer in October 1953 and subsequently served as head of Enlisted Coordinator Section, Personnel Department at Headquarters Marine Corps.
In November 1956, Drake was ordered to England as a student in the Joint Service Staff College in Latimer, Buckinghamshire. Upon graduation in June of the following year, he became the Marine Corps representative to the British Joint Service Amphibious Warfare Center at Poole, Dorset. He was promoted to colonel in September 1957 and returned to the United States in April 1959.
One month later, Drake was appointed executive officer of the personnel division at Headquarters Marine Corps and served in that capacity under Major General August Larson until July 1961, when he was ordered to the Far East. He subsequently assumed duties as commanding officer of the 12th Marine Artillery Regiment, 3rd Marine Division and served in that capacity until August 1962.
Upon his return stateside, Drake attended National War College in Washington, D.C., and graduated in June 1963. His next duty brought him to Quantico, where he was named director, Marine Corps Command and Staff College.
Vietnam War.
Drake was promoted to the rank of brigadier general in January 1966 and appointed director, Marine Corps Reserve at Headquarters Marine Corps. He was responsible for the administration of all reserve marine troops, which were used as reinforcements for combat units in Vietnam. He was promoted to the rank of major general on August 2, 1967. Drake served in that capacity until April 1968 and received his second Legion of Merit for his service there.
He was subsequently ordered to Vietnam, where he assumed duties as deputy commander of XXIV Corps under Lieutenant General Richard G. Stilwell. He served in that capacity during the Tet Offensive and was decorated with Distinguished Service Medal for his service during that period. He also received the Air Medal for his participation in observation flights over the combat area as well as several decorations from the Government of South Vietnam.
In June 1969, Drake was relieved by Major General Edwin B. Wheeler and returned to the United States, where he assumed duties as assistant chief of staff for operations at Headquarters Marine Corps. He served in that capacity until October 1972, when he retired from the Marine Corps after 32 years of active service. During his retirement ceremony, Drake received his third Legion of Merit.
Retirement.
Drake settled in Alexandria, Virginia, where he lived with his wife Margery Forbes Jones. The couple had two children: Christopher, born in 1950, and Carolyn, born in 1951. He died on October 25, 1994, in Seminole, Florida.

Dear Data

"Dear Data" is a collection of postcards containing data recorded from the everyday lives of information designers Stefanie Posavec and Giorgia Lupi. The book was published in the United Kingdom by Penguin Press on September 1, 2016 and in North America by Princeton Architectural Press on September 6, 2016. 
Prior to this year-long collaboration, the co-authors had only met twice. The premise of this project was to test firsthand how well one could get to know someone through reading their data. Postcards were exchanged between them on a weekly basis with the data being represented through a drawing on one side and a detailed key or legend on the other. A few of the topics include: A Week of Negative Thoughts, A Week of A Workspace, and A Week of New Things. The project has surface similarities with the quantified self projects like designer Nicholas Felton's annual reports that quantify and represent life events like number of books read or place visited, but is more personal and less analytical, with hand-drawn illustrations replacing computer generated charts. It "paints a human portrait with data." Dear data is also, in a way, the opposite of Big Data, it is composed of representations little data about on the minutiae of individuals' lives.
The original post cards as well as several accompanying notebooks are now part of the permanent collection at the MoMa.
Reception.
"Dear Data" won two 2015 Information is Beautiful Awards, the Most Beautiful Award as well as Gold in the Dataviz Project category. It was also a finalist for the Innovation By Design Awards 2016 and nominated for the Design Museum Beazley Designs of the Year 2016. While the book was not widely reviewed, reviewers were generally positive. Wired called the book "charming", saying it is "filled with hand drawn postcards and full-page spreads with insights about how it feels to keep a microscope on your life for an entire year." It averages over four (out of five) stars in its more than seven hundred reviews on the social reading site Goodreads.

Juventus F.C.–S.S.C. Napoli rivalry

The Juventus F.C.–S.S.C. Napoli rivalry, is an inter-city football rivalry contested between Turin-based Juventus and Naples-based Napoli.
History.
The rivalry between Juventus and Napoli stems from a historical regional rivalry between Northern Italy and Southern Italy, of which the clubs' respective home cities of Turin and Naples are major metropolitan and economic centers. The rivalry started to gain more attention in the 1980s when Napoli became league contenders.
Juventus won the 1985–86 Serie A title with star player Michel Platini, six points clear of third placed Napoli. The following season, Napoli won their first "scudetto" with star player Diego Maradona, three points ahead of second placed Juventus, the first – and only – Southern Italian team to win the league. Napoli won another, and final title in 1989–90. After that time, in the 1990s, Juventus shared success with Milan in regards to "scudetti", as Napoli started to decline.
In 1997–98, Napoli were relegated to Serie B after winning only two matches. By August 2004, Napoli was declared bankrupt. Film producer Aurelio De Laurentiis refounded Napoli under the name "Napoli Soccer", and were placed in the 2004–05 Serie C1. The following season, they secured promotion to Serie B and De Laurentiis bought back the name "Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli" in May 2006. After one season back in Serie B, Napoli were promoted to Serie A, along with that season's Serie B champions, Juventus, after the "bianconeri" had been relegated the previous season and had their two most recent league titles stripped because of involvement in the Calciopoli scandal.
The rivalry again intensified in the 2010s with Napoli's 2–0 win over Juventus in the 2012 Coppa Italia Final, Juventus captain Alessandro Del Piero's last game for Juventus. Between 2011–12 and 2016–17, Juventus won each league title, with Napoli finishing in at least the top five in each of the seasons. The summer before the 2016–17 season, Argentine forward Gonzalo Higuaín became the third highest football transfer of all-time and highest ever transfer for an Italian club, when he was signed by Juventus for €90 million from Napoli. Higuaín jerseys were burned in the streets of Naples. Since Higuaín joined Juventus in 2016, Napoli fans are not allowed to travel to Turin for Juventus match-ups and vice versa. That season, Juventus paid many fines and had a partial stadium ban because of the repeated chant: 'Vesuvius wash them with lava.' On 22 April 2018, Napoli fans were allowed to travel to Turin, but not those from the Campania region of Italy, where Naples is located. Napoli won the match 1–0 with a 90th-minute header from Kalidou Koulibaly to close the gap to one point behind Juventus in the league table. Despite this, Juventus ended up winning the 2017–18 title, four points ahead of second placed Napoli, extending their record-breaking run of consecutive championships to seven.

French ship Lune (1641)

The Lune was a 38-gun ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, the first ship of the line to be built at the new state dockyard at Île d'Indret near Nantes, designed by Deviot and constructed by the Dutch shipwright Jan Gron (usually called Jean de Werth in French). She and her sister "Soleil" were two-deckers, with a mixture of bronze guns on both gun decks. 
The "Lune" took part in the Battle of Orbitello on 14 June 1646, as the flagship of "Vice-amiral" Louis Foucault de Saint-Germain-Beaupré, Comte de Daugnon, in the Battle of Castellammare on 21/22 December 1647, and in the Battle of Pertuis d'Antioche on 8 August 1652. She sailed on 9 November 1664 from Toulon for the Hyères Islands while carrying troops of the 1st Regiment of Picardy, but a half-hour after sailing she suddenly broke apart at the head and sank "like a marble", with only 60 survivors from over 600 aboard.

2018 ITU World Triathlon Series

The 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series was the 10th season of the World Triathlon Series, the top-level international series for triathlon, since its establishment in 2009. The season consisted of nine pairs of triathlon races for both a men's and women's competition, as well as three mixed relays, beginning on 2 March in Abu Dhabi, and concluding on 16 September with the grand final at the Gold Coast. 
Mario Mola and Flora Duffy began the season as defending champions from the 2017 season. Mola would go on to defend his title and win the men's series for the third time in as many years, becoming the second-most successful triathlete at the world triathlon series after fellow countryman Javier Gómez. 
Duffy's season however would be plagued by injuries, leading to an inability to defend her title despite winning two races early in the season. The eventual winner, Vicky Holland, captured the women's series by moving into first place only after the final race of the series. The most notable event of the year was in Bermuda where the Norwegian team completed the first men's podium sweep, with race winner Casper Stornes having only competed in two prior WTS races.
Overview.
Calendar.
The 2018 ITU World Triathlon Series visited nine cities, and incorporated the three events of the inaugural Mixed Relay Series in Nottingham, Edmonton, and the Mixed Relay world championship in Hamburg.
Point System.
For every race a triathlete finished, they received points based on their position across the line. For a normal world series event, first place was awarded 1,000 points and every subsequent place was awarded 7.5% less, for the first forty triathletes; for the grand final, 1,200 points were awarded, once again decreasing by 7.5% for each place, but this time awarded down to 50th. However, if a triathlete finished outside the time cut (more than 5% longer than the winner's time for men, 8% for women), they received no points even if they finished in a scoring position. A triathlete's final score was the sum of their points from the grand final and their best five race scores of that year.
Overall standings.
The athlete who accumulates the most points throughout the season is declared the year's world champion. The final point standings are:

<doc id="56803360" url="?curid=56803360" title="First Lady Michelle Obama (painting)">
First Lady Michelle Obama (painting)

First Lady Michelle Obama, initially titled Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama, is a portrait of former First Lady of the United States Michelle Obama, painted by the artist Amy Sherald. Unveiled in 2018, it hangs in the National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, D.C. The oil-on-linen painting shows Obama, rendered in Sherald's signature grisaille, resting her chin lightly on her hand, as a geometric print dress flows outward filling the frame against a sky-blue background.
Praised by critics and immensely popular with museum visitors, the National Portrait Gallery's attendance doubled in the two years after the unveiling of Sherald's portrait along with Kehinde Wiley's portrait of President Barack Obama. Museum director Kim Sajet credits Sherald and Wiley with reinvigorating the genre of portrait painting. Sherald and Wiley were also the first African American artists to receive commissions for National Portrait Gallery presidential portraits.
Background.
In 2017, for her portrait for the National Portrait Gallery, former First Lady Michelle Obama chose the artist Amy Sherald, who like Obama is African American. Both the President and First Lady met with Sherald as a candidate to paint their respective portraits, but Sherald and Michelle Obama had an immediate connection. Obama described the meeting:Within the first few minutes of our conversation, I knew she was the one for me. And maybe it was the moment she came in and she looked at Barack and she said, 'Well, Mr. President, I'm really excited to be here, and I know I'm being considered for both portraits,' she said, 'but, Mrs. Obama'she physically turned to me and she said'I'm really hoping you and I can work together.'Sherald, who is from Columbus, Georgia, and then living in Baltimore, was 43 and a rising star in the art world. Just a few years prior she had still been waiting tables to pay the bills, but in 2016 her painting "Miss Everything (Unsuppressed Deliverance)" won the National Portrait Gallery's Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. The citation praised her "innovative, dynamic portraits that, through color and form, confront the psychological effects of stereotypical imagery on African-American subjects". Sherald was the first woman and first African-American to win the competition. Sherald and Kehinde Wiley, the artist President Barack Obama selected for his portrait, became the first African American artists commissioned to paint presidential portraits for the National Portrait Gallery.
Obama, with input from Sherald, also selected her dress for the sitting, choosing a design from the Spring 2017 collection of the line Milly by fashion designer Michelle Smith. Obama and her stylist Meredith Koop had worked with Smith previously, including for an "Essence" magazine cover shoot. Smith pulled the dress from production so it would be unique to Obama and worked with the team remotely to tailor the design for her, but the final wardrobe selection was not revealed until the painting's unveiling ceremony at the National Portrait Gallery.
Creative process.
Sherald, whose signature grayscale is influenced in part by the black-and-white photographs of Black people that W.E.B. DuBois showed at the 1900 Paris Exposition, spent two 90-minute sessions photographing Obama, then painted from the photographs. Sherald noted she felt struck by how much Obama resembled her daughter Malia in Sherald's photographs.
While Sherald typically does not take individual portrait commissions and instead selects sitters for her portraits from the people she meets in her everyday life, she felt Obama shared the relatability and authentic presence of her past sitters: common people "just being themselves." Sherald sought to portray these traits, significant as the qualities that made Obama feel accessible to ordinary people.
The Obamas as well as officials from the National Portrait Gallery saw photographs of the painting while it was still a work in progress, but made no requests for adjustments to the portrait, leaving complete creative control to Sherald.
Sherald initially titled the painting "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama".
Style.
The portrait is a large oil painting on linen, standing tall and wide.
Obama's face, as well as her visible arms and hands, are stylized in shades of gray, an artistic technique known as grisaille, a key theme in works by Sherald. Of the choice to use grayscale instead of color in painting skin, Sherald said the intention was to resist reductive readings of race that placed the sitter in a box: "To me when you see brown skin, it tends to codify something. So through the gray you're almost allowed to look past that into the real person." The background is a simple blue evoking American folk art.
Art and architecture critic Philip Kennicott described Sherald's portrait as portraying Obama with "a curious mix of confidence and vulnerability." He described the juxtaposition of Obama's face, painted "in the gray tones of an old black-and-white photograph," with the vibrant "robin's egg blue background" as a technique Sherald often uses to impart "a heightened sense of the surreal."
The dress dominates the work as a mountain-like triangle. A full-length halter gown with a modern geometric pattern from the American womenswear line Milly, the dress struck designer Michelle Smith as appropriate to the occasion both because its style reflected the way Obama dresses in her daily life and because, to Smith, the material and design symbolized Obama's contemporary sensibilities in her life overall: "It's made of a stretch cotton poplin print in a clean, minimal, geometric print without a reference to anything past or nostalgic, which gives the dress a very forward-thinking sensibilitythis is very Michelle Obama." By contrast Sherald said the dress reminded her of the works of 20th century Dutch painter Piet Mondrian and the African-American quilting tradition of Gee's Bend, Alabama, a community descended from formerly enslaved African Americans. Sherald felt it echoed the Gee's Bend tradition of "composing quilts in geometries that transform clothes and fabric remnants into masterpieces."
Writing in "The New Yorker", art critic Peter Schjeldahl remarked on his first impression, viewing the piece in reproduction, of the "immense cotton gown [...] which fills most of the canvas that isn't taken up by a light-blue ground." Initially it seemed to him to be "an overwhelming of the wearer by the worn." His impression changed completely after seeing the work in person and he urged readers: "You mustand I mean absolutely have tosee Sherald's work in person, if at all possible. Taking in the painting's scale [...] and the sensitive suavity of its brushwork (a tissue of touches, each a particular decision)," Schjeldahl came to a widely shared critical conclusion that Sherald had captured the essential qualities and challenges of Michelle Obama's role and identity: "I decided that artist and sitter had achieved a mind meld, to buoyant effect. The dress amounts to a symbol of Michelle's public rolea tall order for anyoneand the éclat with which she performs it."
Exhibition and reception.
Together with Wiley's portrait of President Barack Obama, the paintings were first exhibited at the National Portrait Gallery beginning February 12, 2018. Sherald's portrait drew strong reaction, with some commentators complaining that they felt it did not look like Obama. Sherald responded with an analogy: "Some people like their poetry to rhyme. Some people don't."
Cultural critic Doreen St. Félix agreed that the portrait departed from photorealism"The mouth and the eyes and the strong arms that we know are present, but fainter. From some distance, I can imagine, the figure might not be immediately recognizable."but felt this choice was integral to the image's success as a portrait of this sitter, by compelling the viewer to "work to bring its subject to lifeto remember what Michelle Obama has endured."
Art critics generally praised the work: in "New York", Jerry Saltz wrote a review declaring, "The Obamas' Official Portraits Rise to the Occasion." In "The New Yorker", Schjeldahl called Sherald's piece "a tour de force within the constraint imposed by a political commission." The director of the National Portrait Gallery, Kim Sajet, credited Sherald and Wiley for reinvigorating portrait painting as an artistic genre: "Portraiture used to be seen as this old-fashioned, fuddy-duddy, really for dead white people kind of way of painting ... and they've completely changed that and put it on its head."
Visitors flocked to see the portrait in person. The unveiling led to thousands lined up at the entrance, and a threefold increase in visitors compared to the previous President's Day weekend. As of February 2020, attendance at the National Portrait Gallery had doubled since the unveiling, bringing four million visitors to the museum and turning the queue to see the paintings into its own social experience.
Parker Curry photograph.
Shortly after the painting was put on display, a photograph of a two-year-old African American girl, staring at the painting in awe, went viral on social media, prompting conversation about the value of representation in art. The child pictured was Parker Curry and the photograph taken by Ben Hines of North Carolina, another visitor to the museum that day. Obama later met with Parker and her mother Jessica Curry
and the occasion inspired a children's book, "Parker Looks Up", written by the Currys and published by Simon and Schuster.
Later exhibits.
Beginning on November 13, 2020, and running through May 23, 2021, "First Lady Michelle Obama" as well as the Michelle Smith dress Obama wore for the sitting are part of an exhibition entitled, "Every Eye Is Upon Me: First Ladies of the United States."
A tour with both Sherald's and Wiley's paintings of the Obamas is planned for 2021. Slated to begin in June, the paintings will be shown for two months each in Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Houston. The tour planning is emphasizing low-cost tickets so the exhibit will be accessible to as many people as possible; admission to see the paintings in the National Portrait Gallery is free.

Operation Draufgänger

The Operation Draufgänger (German for "daredevil"; ) was a German Wehrmacht military operation against the Yugoslav Partisans at the Montenegrin-Serbian border area, aimed at breaking the Partisan foothold on the Lim river which was a potential penetration point into Serbia. In turn, it was a Partisan counter-operation, known as the Andrijevica Operation (). The operation began on 18 July on the Čakor–Gusinje–Andrijevica–Berane line, when Kampfgruppe E burnt down at least 16 villages and killed several hundreds inhabitants. From different directions, German troops attacked villages and a part approached Andrijevica, pushed out parts of two Partisan brigades, and then took over the town on 19 July and continued attacking. The staffs of the Partisan brigades assessed the combined German forces as inadequate and self-initiatively decided to attacks, resulting in great German losses. With the possibility to surround and destroy, the II Assault Corps gave the operational command on 23 July on general attack. From different directions the German troops were surrounded in the wider region of Murino on 24 July. On 28 July the Partisan 2nd, 5th and 17th divisions were ordered to move across the Ibar, which gave the opportunity for the 14th Regiment SS to break through Čakor towards Peć, while larger part of the 21st Division SS broke and many Albanians deserted. The German troops were decisively defeated, and the Partisans moved for action in Serbia. Operation Rübezahl followed.
At Velika, on 28 July, the 21st Division made up of Albanians killed at least 428 civilians, mostly children, women and elderly, as a reprisal to local support for the Partisans.

Vapour-phase-mediated antimicrobial activity

The vapour-phase-mediated antimicrobial activity (VMAA) is the inhibitory or cidal antimicrobial activity of a molecule in a liquid culture, following its initial evaporation and migration via the vapour-phase Two new "in vitro" assays i.e. the vapour-phase-mediated patch assay and the vapour-phase-mediated susceptibility assay were developed to detect and quantify the VMAA. Both assays belong to the newest class of vaporisation assays i.e. the broth microdilution derived vaporisation assays. In contrast, most other vaporisation assays belong to the class of agar disk diffusion derived vaporisation assays and quantify the antimicrobial activity of the vapour-phase itself. Both classes of vaporisation assays are useful and measure different aspects of the antimicrobial capacity of molecules.
Applications.
Possible applications for volatiles like volatile organic compounds with VMAA are: maintaining hygiene in hospitals, treating post-harvest contamination, protecting crops against pathogens and pests, and treating infections of the digestive, vaginal or respiratory tract.

I and Me is a puzzle-platform game developed by Chinese studio Wish Fang and published by Ratalaika Games. It was released on the Nintendo Switch in the Japan and PAL regions on July 6, 2017 and in the North American region on July 13, 2017. The game has received mixed reviews.
Reception.
Review aggregator Metacritic assigned a score of 60/100 to I and Me, indicating "Mixed or average reviews". In his review for Nintendo Life, Morgan Sleeper called the level design "clever" and mentioning that each level feels like "one big puzzle" rather than a "series of tricky sequences" which made for a "nice snappy pace". Positive remarks were also given to the game's art style with Sleeper remarking that the game was "beautiful" and positively compared it to a film by Studio Ghibli. He ultimately gave the game 8/10 stars.
Reviewing the game for Pocket Gamer, Emily Sowden gave the game a 6/10 saying that she found the short length of the levels "wonderful" and mentioned that the soundtrack, while relaxing, didn't distract too much from the game which she found to be "ideal" for a platformer. Negative comments were directed towards the "sheer repetition" of the game, which Sowden lamented made for a game that provided "little challenge".

Hyman Schorenstein

Hyman Schorenstein (unknown – February 3, 1953) was a Brooklyn Democratic leader who dominated Brooklyn politics for three decades beginning in the late 1910s. He influenced Meade Esposito, a Democratic party fixer.
Schorenstein immigrated from Austria in the late 1800s. He took control of politics in Brownsville, Brooklyn and was voted into office representing the Democratic Party. He led the effort to oppose socialists who were against United States involvement in World War I. Schorenstein became the first Jewish Democratic District leader. He was able to impress the Irish political machine and was appointed an election district captain at the age of 20. He offered local residents favors for their votes. One story alleged he gave 10 boots to a family of fisherman promising they would arrive after the election.
In 1928, Schorenstein was credited with stopping an eleventh-hour revolt in the Ohio delegation. He guaranteed Governor Al Smith of New York the nomination for president.
Schorenstein's illiteracy was well known. Schorenstein political rival’s challenge him to his literacy in 1933 when Schorenstein was Brooklyn's commissioner of records. The rival asked "can you read or write English?" to which Schorenstein replied "that’s my own personal business". Milton S. Gould, Schorenstein's friend who was a lawyer said, "there was one tragic flaw in the effulgent personality of this municipal monarch: He was illiterate."
After dominating local politics for three decades, Schorenstein was voted out of office largely due to the Italian mafia sending hundreds of associates to illegally vote against him in his district.
His nephew Walter Herbert Shorenstein was a real estate investor and a top Democratic donor who, at one point, became the largest landlord in San Francisco.

2018 Florence shooting

On 5 March 2018, Idy Diene, a 54-year-old Senegalese immigrant, was fatally shot near the central Ponte Amerigo Vespucci in Florence, Italy. The shooter, who was identified as Roberto Pirrone, turned himself in to the police. While the police have deemed that the shooting was not racially or politically motivated, local African immigrant communities have held protests, citing the murder as prejudiced.
Timeline.
On the morning of 5 March 2018, Roberto Pirrone left his house with a gun, intending to kill himself. He then changed his mind and decided to shoot anyone he encountered, believing that he would not be a burden to his family in prison. After trying and failing to commit suicide, he pointed his gun at a mother with a child, but decided not to shoot them. He then saw Idy Diene, a Senegalese trader, and shot him three times in quick succession. Pirrone then turned himself in to the police. A medical team managed to revive the victim, who died forty minutes later. The crime scene was cordoned off by the police.
Suspect.
Pirrone explained to the police that he wanted to kill himself for economic reasons while breaking into tears. A farewell note to his daughter was found in his home in the Oltrarno district not far from the bridge. The police confirmed that there was no racist intent in the perpetrated murder. Pirrone was an arms collector and leftist militant. During a search of his house, the Italian police discovered numerous weapons and relics of the former Soviet Union.
Reactions.
The Senegalese community in Florence protested against the shooting, believing that it was racially motivated. A group of Senegalese immigrants went to the Florentine town hall to confront the mayor of Florence, Dario Nardella. The police intervened in riot gear to contain the protest. The mayor condemned the murder and extended the support of the city to the victim's family and the broader Senegalese community. He further condemned the violence and rioting. The mayor participated in the anti-racist demonstration that took place in Florence on March 10, 2018 and visited the scene of the murder, where he was confronted by a group of protesters.

2018 Belmont Stakes

The 2018 Belmont Stakes was the 150th running of the Belmont Stakes and the 107th time the event took place at Belmont Park. The race, known as the "test of the champion", is the final leg in the American Triple Crown. It is a Grade I stakes race with a purse of $1.5 million, open to three-year-old Thoroughbreds. The race took place on June 9, 2018, and was broadcast on NBC starting at 4 p.m. EDT. Justify won the race with a time of 2:28.18, becoming the thirteenth American Triple Crown winner.
Field.
Entries for the Belmont were taken on June 5, followed by the post position draw. Justify was attempting to become the first horse to win the American Triple Crown since American Pharoah did so in 2015. He faced horses that he had previously beaten in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness, plus a few "new shooters" who did not compete in those races. His major competitors included:
Audible, who finished third in the Kentucky Derby and would have been one of Justify's top competitors in the Belmont, was not considered for the race. Although the two colts have different trainers, they share common ownership (WinStar Farm, China Horse Club, Starlight Racing and Head of Plains Partners), leading some to conclude that the owners did not want to increase the pressure on Justify in his Triple Crown bid.
Race description.
The 2018 Belmont Stakes was run on June 9 over a fast track before a sold-out crowd of 90,327. The New York Racing Association had decided to cap admission for the race after logistical difficulties at the 2014 event. The on-track handle, or total amount bet on the race, was $16,159,584, up from 2017 but somewhat less that bet in 2014 and 2015 – the last two Belmonts where the Triple Crown was on the line. The all-source handle for the race was $72,702,815, up sharply from 2017 but down compared to the record set in 2014. The race was broadcast by NBC. 
Having drawn post position one, Justify risked getting trapped on the rail if he started poorly. Instead, he broke well and jockey Mike Smith sent him to the lead with a quick opening quarter of 23.37. Meanwhile, the eventual runner-up Gronkowski started poorly and trailed the field. Justify then slowed down the pace as they moved around the first turn, leading by two lengths over Restoring Hope. None of the other jockeys chose to challenge Justify for the lead, so he settled into an easy stride down the backstretch, completing the opening mile in 1:38.09. Around the far turn, Restoring Hope started to tire while Vino Rosso mounted a drive to move into second place. From farther back, Gronkowski and Hofburg also started closing rapidly. Despite drifting out slightly in the stretch, Justify held off the challengers to win by lengths over Gronkowski with Hofburg another lengths back in third. Justify completed the mile and a half in 2:28.18.
The win made Justify the 13th winner of the American Triple Crown, and just the second horse to accomplish the feat while still undefeated, joining 1977 winner Seattle Slew. It was the second Triple Crown win for Baffert, who also trained American Pharoah.

Sandals South Coast F.C.

Sandals South Coast FC is a Jamaican football club based in Westmoreland, which currently plays in the top flight Jamaica National Premier League.
History.
When the football programme began at Sandals South Coast (then Sandals Whitehouse) in 2007 it was little more than a fun pastime for employees at the resort as part of the resort's existing Sports Programme. However, as enthusiasm began to grow for the sport among young men on resort, the Management team zoomed in on the available talent pool and started looking for ways in which to engage their interest. Coach Aaron Lawrence joined the team that year and soon Sandals South Coast had representation at the community/corner league level.

2020 in public domain

When a work's copyright expires, it enters the public domain. The following is a list of works that entered the public domain in 2020. Since laws vary globally, the copyright status of some works is not uniform.
Entering the public domain in countries with life + 70 years.
With the exception of Belarus (Life + 50 years) and Spain (which has a copyright term of Life + 80 years for creators that died before 1987), a work enters the public domain in Europe at the end of the calendar year following 70 years after the creator's death, if it was published during the creator's lifetime. Russia has a 4-year extension to Life+ 70 (in essence Life+74) for authors who worked during World War II in the Soviet Union. The list is sorted alphabetically and includes a notable work of the creator that entered the public domain on January 1, 2020.
Entering the public domain in countries with life + 50 years.
In most countries of Africa and Asia, as well as Belarus, Bolivia, Canada, New Zealand, Egypt and Uruguay; a work enters the public domain at the end of the calendar year following 50 years after the creator's death.
Entering the public domain in Australia.
In 2004 copyright in Australia changed from a "plus 50" law to a "plus 70" law, in line with America and the European Union. But the change was not made retroactive (unlike the 1995 change in the European Union which brought some European authors back into copyright, especially those who died from 1925 to 1944). Hence the work of an author who died before 1955 is normally in the public domain in Australia; but the copyright of authors was extended to 70 years after death for those who died in 1955 or later, and no more Australian authors will come out of copyright until 1 January 2026 (those who died in 1955).
Unpublished works by authors who died in 1949 entered the public domain on 1 January 2020. Any published literary, artistic, dramatic, or musical work (other than computer programs) by a not generally known author (anonymous or pseudonymous) from 1949 also entered the public domain on that date.
Entering the public domain in the United States.
Works that entered the public domain on January 1, 2020 in the United States include:
Some of the published works that entered the public domain include the earliest sheet music for George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue" and Buster Keaton's silent comedy film "Sherlock Jr."
Tom Lehrer.
In October 2020, satirical singer/songwriter Tom Lehrer announced the release of all of his lyrics and music to the public domain.

Ornithoteuthis

Ornithoteuthis is a small genus of squid, with two species, from the family Ommastrephidae, the "flying squids", the two species in this genus are known as "bird squids". They are relatively small squid, with mantle lengths of around 100–200 mm, highly agile and rather uncommon. Their characteristics that distinguish then from other members of the subfamily Ommastrephinae are that their mantle and fins are drawn out into a narrow tail and that they have a luminous stripe along their midline on the viscera. One species, "Ornithoteuthis antillarum", is found in the warmer waters of the Atlantic Ocean and the other, "Ornithoteuthis volatilis", in similar areas of the Indo-Pacific oceans, they are closely related and are thought to have been a result of relatively recent speciation.
The genus contains bioluminescent species.

Paul was born in Budapest on December 22, 1914. He attended the Brno University of Technology, Czechoslovakia followed by Swiss Polytechnic Institute, Zurich. After his graduation in 1937 Weidlinger went to London looking for work. Whilst sitting in his room at 3 Bedford Square reading the telephone directory he came across the name of László Moholy-Nagy. He decided to cold call him and was successful in being taken on as a draftsman. During his stay in London he visited the Paris World Fair and particularly appreciated the Pavilion des Temps Nouveaux, (Pavilion of New Times), a tent pavilion designed by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret. From April to August 1938 he was working for Le Corbusier.
After leaving Europe in 1939 he worked and taught in La Paz, Bolivia. In 1943 he moved on to the United States where he started working for Charles Wohlstetter designing modular aircraft hangars that could be assembled quickly. With Charles' brother Albert Wohlstetter and Weidlinger worked at the United States Housing Authority applying these modular principles to domestic residential buildings.

Clifford Skakle

Clifford "Cliff" Skakle (born October 26, 1956) is a former professional tennis player from the United States. He was born in Buxton, North Carolina to Intercollegiate Tennis Association Hall of Fame Coach Don Skakle and Sybil Skakle. When Cliff was two, the family moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where Don served as head coach of the men's tennis team at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill (UNC).
Prior to turning professional, Skakle played tennis for UNC, where he was the All-ACC Individual Flight Champion from 1974–1978. During that period, the UNC men's team won the ACC team championship every year. He completed his collegiate career with a singles record of 77–18 and doubles record of 96–9. Skakle's father Don was his coach for the entirety of his career.
Career.
Skakle turned pro in 1978, joining the ATP world tour. He played professionally for a year until he suffered an injury to his Achilles tendon in Strasbourg, France. He was then ruled ineligible for play in early 1979. He returned to the tour in March 1980, for an ATP event in Costa Rica, featuring a first round match up against the #1 player in the world, Jimmy Connors. Connors defeated Skakle 6–1, 6–2. Skakle competed for Country Club Aixois Aix-en-Provence in French InterClub in 1980 and 1981. Skakle's career featured notable matches against Jimmy Connors and Eliot Teltscher; and in doubles against Stan Smith/Bob Lutz at Wimbledon.

Bolshoy Oleny Island

Bolshoy Oleny Island () is an island in the Kola district of the Murmansk region of Russia. It is located in the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea, 2.5 km northeast of the city of Polyarny, and 35 km north of Murmansk.
There is an important archaeological site on the island. Settlers arrived to this area about 3,500 years ago, or earlier.
Area status.
The island is a protected area, which is under the protection of the Murmansk biological station.
In 1910 a lighthouse was built on the island.
In 1950-2006, there was a town here that was called Mayak Bolshoi Oleny.
Archaeology.
In 1925, the Olenostrovsky burial ground of the early metal era was discovered here, which was excavated in 1928 by A.V. Schmidt, and in 1947-1948 by N.N. Gurina.
Excavations uncovered 23 burials in shallow pits; among them were the burials in wooden boxes, as well as those using tarred leather wrappings. There are two instances of cremation. The inventory includes tools made of stone and bone, such as arrowheads, daggers, awls, needles, and fish hooks. A copper arrowhead, and a sculpture of the head of an elk were found. 5 fragments of "wafer" ceramics were also found.
Dating.
Earlier it was thought that the Olenostrovsky site belonged to the middle of the I millennium BC. But new radiocarbon dates were obtained for two graves on the island. The new dates are centred around 1500–1400 BC. The organic preservation is very good.
Recent exploration.
In 2001, four additional clusters of human bones and artefacts were discovered in the eastern part of the burial ground. Also, 59 fragments of Asbestos-ceramic were collected, showing broad analogies in the territory of Karelia and the Kola Peninsula (where this type of ceramics is usually dated to the second half of the 3rd millennium BC).
Asbestos-ceramics of the early 'Lovozero Ware' type were found on the Island.
Furthermore, a later type of the asbestos tempered ware was also found, known in the Russian archaeological literature as ‘waffe’ ware. In Norwegian and Finnish literature, similar impressions on pottery are usually called ‘textile’ or ‘imitated textile’.
Particularly noteworthy is the discovery of fragments of a ladle for pouring molten metal.
The presence of different types of dishes has implications both regarding the duration of the operation of the cemetery, and its use by different cultural groups of the population.
A ship burial was found in 2003. Skulls from this burial are related to the culture of 'sea hunters' (dating 3200 BP), and have a specific 'Urals anthropological type'. Among the modern populations, they are closest to the Ural groups and completely different from the Saami.
Paleogenetics.
Mitochondrial haplogroups C*, C5, U5a, U5a1, U4a1, Z1a, D* and T* were identified in fossil remains of the population. According to scientists, the greatest genetic similarity with samples from the Island was shown by modern Siberian populations, mainly in the Yenisei River basin. Presumably, the population of the Island arrived to the Kola Peninsula 3,500 years ago from Central Siberia, but then the traces of this migration faded away, thus not being reflected in the gene pool of modern populations of the Kola Peninsula.

Martin Horváth

Martin Horváth is an Austrian writer and musician currently living in Vienna.
Early life and education.
Martin Horvath was born in 1967 in Vienna. He grew up with his 4 siblings in a teacher's family in the Großfeldsiedlung in Vienna. From 1985 to 1991, he studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts.
Early writing.
Martin Horváth began publishing short prose, essays, and other works in literary magazines and anthologies in 1989.
"Buchkultur".
"Buchkultur" is an Austrian literary magazine that published its first issue in 1989 and still publishes today. It began as a quarterly magazine that included book reviews, author interviews, information on book markets, etc. In its first issue, the magazine describes itself as a cross between a literary magazine and a classifieds publication for book stores. It says that part of its mission is to introduce its readers to more Austrian authors.
Michael Horváth, Martin Horváth’s brother, began with the magazine as the editor for the section on international book markets. Martin Horváth was a member of the editorial staff from 1989-1992 and was published by the magazine frequently. During his years in New York City, he was the magazine’s New York correspondent.
"Jenseits des Schlussstrichs - Gedenkdienst im Diskurs über Österreichs nationalsozialistische Vergangenheit".
This publication was the culmination of the Austrian Heritage Collection project, begun in 1996 and which was a collaboration of the Austrian Holocaust Memorial Service and the Leo Baeck Institute (New York City). The project had two goals: first, to document the stories of Austrian Jews who were expelled from Austria and who then emigrated to the USA, and second, to engage young Austrians in dialogue with former Austrians. Horváth participated in the data collection, conducting interviews and analyzing surveys. The book was published in 2002 by Horváth, Anton Legerer, Judith Pfeifer, and Stephan Roth. Horváth, in addition to editing the volume, also contributed an essay titled “Eine Art Wiedergutmachung: Begegnungen mit ehemaligen Österreicherinnen in New York” (“A Kind of Making-Up: Encounters with Former Austrians,” English translation not available.)
Other publications.
“Der Tod der Euridice.” "Blut in der Bassena. Mörderische Geschichten aus Wien". dtv, München: 1995 (as Julia Martins). Editor Michael Horvath.
"Erweiterte Wohnzimmer: Leben im Wiener Kaffeehaus" (1990), a book about the café scene in Vienna, Austria.
“Österreich zuerst.” "Podium". Nr. 115/116.
Novels.
"Mohr im Hemd, oder wie ich auszog, die Welt zu retten".
"Mohr im Hemd, oder wie ich auszog, die Welt zu retten" (literal English translation: "Moor in a Shirt, Or How I Set out to Save the World", not available in English, though) is named after a popular Viennese dessert with a controversial name. (A charity, SOS Mitmensch, began a campaign to change the name in 2012.) It was published by German publisher dtv in 2012 and is Horváth’s debut novel.
The novel centers around Ali, a 15-year-old asylum seeker living on the juvenile floor of an asylum home in Vienna, Austria. Ali speaks every language he encounters in the home, observes more events than are humanly possible, and delivers commentary upon all he hears and sees. Ali introduces the reader to a host of residents on the juvenile floor and the stories of how they arrived. Throughout the book, the reader learns of the various fates of these characters.
In 2005/06, Horváth completed training as a refugee assistant as part of his research for this novel. The subjects of immigration, asylum, etc., are important to him, and he intended to write a book with a message. He says, “In Austria, we’ve gotten used to foreigners being vilified, that politicians appeal to the lowest instincts. That makes me angry.”
Although an Austrian himself, Horváth published the book with a German publisher, because Austrian publishers turned it down. The book received generally positive reviews from various newspapers and online literary platforms, e.g.. It was often labeled a picaresque novel and sometimes compared with Grimmelshausen’s "Simplicius Simplicissimus". On Goodreads, it received 3.94/5 stars, with 17 ratings. On Lovely Books, a German online reading platform, it averaged 4/5 stars, with 24 ratings. On amazon.de, 4/5 stars, 16 ratings. All ratings as accessed March 7, 2018.
Future works.
Horváth plans to write more (28) and in 2013/14 he began work on his second novel.
Letter to Amazon.
Horváth was one among a long list of authors (including Nobel Prize-winner Elfriede Jelinek) who wrote an open letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Amazon German CEO Ralf Kleber, protesting how Amazon dealt with contract issues with the Sweden-based publisher Bonnier Group, which included Aladin, arsEdition, Berlin Verlag, Carlsen, Hörbuch Hamburg, Piper, Thienemann-Esslinger, and Ullstein. The letter, dated 2014, claims that Amazon was boycotting authors whose books appeared under these publishers, by not keeping enough copies in storage. Books from these publishing houses, according to the signatories, were being delivered slowly and omitted from Amazon’s recommendations. The letter further accused Amazon of giving the impression to customers that it didn’t interfere with book sales in this manner
Music.
Horváth plays the double-bass. and violon. He plays with the sirene Operntheater and with Ensemble Continuum. He has been playing as a freelance musician since 1988
He has played with the following orchestras:
He is also a member of the Merlin-Ensemble and the Styraburg Ensemble. He has played chamber music at the Salzburger Festspiele, Schubertiade Feldkirch, and Ferrara Musica.

San Marino participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, held in Tel Aviv, Israel. The Sammarinese broadcaster San Marino RTV (SMRTV) confirmed that a second season of "1in360" would not take place to select the entry. In January 2019, they announced that Serhat had been internally selected to represent the nation in the contest with the song "Say Na Na Na", co-written by himself and Mary Susan Applegate. Serhat had previously represented San Marino in 2016 but failed to qualify for the final. To promote the entry, a music video for the song was released and Serhat made appearances at Eurovision parties in Amsterdam and Madrid in the lead up to the contest. San Marino performed last (17th) in the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, held on 14 May 2019, and placed 8th, receiving 150 points. The entry qualified for the grand final held four days later, where the nation placed 19th with 77 points. This marked their best placing to this point and their second grand final qualification.
Background.
Prior to the 2019 contest, San Marino had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest nine times since their first entry in 2008. The nation's debut entry in the 2008 contest, "Complice" performed by Miodio, failed to qualify for the grand final and placed last in the semi-final it competed in. San Marino subsequently did not participate in both the and contests, citing financial difficulties. They returned in with Italian singer Senit performing "Stand By", which also failed to take the nation to the grand final. From 2012 to 2014, San Marino sent Valentina Monetta to the contest on three consecutive occasions, which made her the first singer to participate in three consecutive contests since Udo Jürgens, who competed in 1964, 1965 and 1966 for Austria. Monetta's entries in ("The Social Network Song") and ("Crisalide (Vola)") also failed to qualify San Marino to the grand final, however in , she managed to bring the nation to the final for the first time with "Maybe", placing 24th. This marked their best placing to this point. The nation's next three entries, "Chain of Lights" performed by Anita Simoncini and Michele Perniola for , "I Didn't Know" by Serhat for and "Spirit of the Night" by Monetta and Jimmie Wilson for , did not qualify for the grand final. To this point, all of the nation's entries had been selected internally. For the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, SMRTV staged their first national final, entitled "1in360", and selected Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening with "Who We Are", though this also failed to qualify for the grand final.
Before Eurovision.
Internal selection.
On 7 November 2018, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) included San Marino in their list of the 42 countries that had signed up to partake in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. After initially exploring the use of "1in360" for a second year, San Marino ultimately opted to return to an internal selection process. On 21 January 2019, Radiotelevisione della Repubblica di San Marino (SMRTV) held a press conference where they announced that Serhat was internally selected to represent San Marino in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. SMRTV Director Carlo Romeo and San Marino Head of Delegation Alessandro Capicchioni were also in attendance for the event. The Turkish singer had previously represented the nation in the 2016 contest held in Stockholm, Sweden, where he performed the song "I Didn't Know", though he failed to qualify the country for the final. In support of their decision, Romeo stated that their 10th anniversary in the contest was an important goal for them and they wanted to choose an established international artist. Serhat provided the opportunity to select a "citizen of the World" and someone with whom they could recreate a close-knit team. The announcement was followed by a second press conference the following week at Hotel Marmara in Istanbul where Serhat announced his participation to the Turkish media. His song "Say Na Na Na" was presented on 7 March at a media event held in Tel Aviv and was available for digital download along with nine remixes. The song was composed by Serhat with lyrics written in collaboration with Mary Susan Applegate.
Prior to the selection of Serhat, two artists were rumoured by the press to have been in consideration: social media influencer and "Human Ken Doll" Jessica Alves and Russian Daryanna Kraieva. Alves spoke to the press about the potential participation, further fueling these rumours. In response, SMRTV stated that they would neither confirm nor deny the speculation, directing people to wait for the 21 January announcement.
Promotion.
To promote the entry, a music video for "Say Na Na Na" was released on 7 March 2019, coinciding with the song's presentation. Directed by Thierry Vergness, it was filmed at Isiklar Studio in Istanbul and was completed by 24 February. SMRTV was looking for an international team to create the video and released interviews by production staff in their native languages extending through March. To further promote the entry, Serhat performed as one of 28 represented countries during the eleventh annual edition of "Eurovision in Concert" on 6 April 2019, which was held at the club AFAS Live concert hall in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Marlayne Sahupala and Cornald Maas. Later that month on 19 and 20 April, he performed during the third annual "PrePartyES" event, which was held at the La Riviera venue in Madrid, Spain.
At Eurovision.
The Eurovision Song Contest 2019 took place at Expo Tel Aviv in Tel Aviv, Israel. It consisted of two semi-finals held on 14 and 16 May, respectively, and the grand final on 18 May 2019. All nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big Five", consisting of , , , and the , were required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top 10 countries from each semi-final progress to the final. Semi-finalists were allocated into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests as determined by the contest's televoting partner Digame, with the aim of reducing the chance of neighbourly voting between countries while also increasing suspense during the voting process. On 28 January 2019, an allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals and determined which half of the show they would perform in. San Marino was placed into the first semi-final, to be held on 14 May 2019, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show. Once all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. San Marino was set to perform in position 17 (last), following the entry from Greece. In San Marino, the two semi-finals and the grand final were broadcast on San Marino RTV and Radio San Marino with commentary by Lia Fiorio and Gigi Restivo. 
Performances.
Serhat performed "Say Na Na Na" during the jury show on 13 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries, an event that determines half of the final vote. The following night, he performed the song last in the first semi-final, following the entry from Greece. The performance featured Serhat surrounded by two male dancers and three female backing vocalists, all dressed in white. Serhat described the performance as being very modern and reminiscent of the music video, though adjustments had to be made such as limited the number of people on stage to six. At the end of the night, San Marino was announced as one of the ten countries to have qualified for the grand final, making it only the second time they reached the final and their first qualification since . It was later revealed that San Marino placed eighth in the semi-final, receiving a total of 150 points: 124 points from the televoting and 26 points from the juries.
After the show, Serhat appeared at a press conference with the other nine finalists to draw which half of the grand final he would participate in. San Marino was drawn to perform in the first half of the grand final. At the final, held on 18 May, Serhat performed "Say Na Na Na" seventh, following the entry from Denmark and preceding the entry from North Macedonia. At the close of voting, the nation finished 19th with 77 points, giving San Marino their best result to this point.
Voting.
Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1–8, 10 and 12: one from their expert jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent. The jury judged each entry based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality and the overall impression by the act. No member of a national jury was permitted to be connected in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. John Kennedy O'Connor served as the Sammarinese spokesperson, who announced the votes awarded by the Sammarinese jury during the grand final. Below is a breakdown of points awarded to San Marino and awarded by San Marino in both the first semi-final and the grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows.

Villa delle Peschiere

Villa Pallavicino delle Peschiere is a 16th-century villa in Genoa, Northwestern Italy, built in 1560 for the nobleman Tobia Pallavicino. It is situated in via San Bartolomeo degli Armeni 25, in the quarter of Castelletto, in an area that, at the time when the villa was built, was still outside of the city walls. After the urban expansion of the 19th century, it is now located in the center of the city. The villa still belongs to the Pallavicino family.
History.
The villa was built in 1560 as a summer house for the Genoese nobleman Tobia Pallavicino, a wealthy merchant in alum, in an elevated area over the city which, in the 16th century, was still outside of the city walls. While the villa was being constructed, Tobia Pallavicino also commissioned his in the Strada Nuova (Italian for "New Street", now via Garibaldi), known today as Palazzo Carrega-Cataldi.
Raffaele Soprani attributed the design of the villa to Galeazzo Alessi in 1674, although he still doubted whether “"some reforms and additions"" should not be attributed to Giovanni Battista Castello "il Bergamasco" instead, who was building a city palace for Tobia Pallavicino in the same period.
The villa underwent some alterations and a general restoration before 1846. In the second half of the 19th century, the large park was reduced in size to make way to the opening of via Peschiera.
Charles Dickens is one of the notable guests who stayed at the villa and described in his "Pictures from Italy" the views over the city and the Acquasola gardens which one could enjoy from the park.
Description.
Architecture.
Galeazzo Alessi used in Villa delle Peschiere some new approaches to connect the garden and the interior of the villa. In particular, he built two main entrances, one on each side, thus realizing an organic continuity between the garden, the central rooms and the staircase. The southern facade is sumptuously decorated, with geometrical compositions and a decorative scheme of Ionic and Corinthian lesene
Decoration.
The internal stuccoes and the hexagonal bathroom (a bizarre fashion of the time, documented in several Genoese villas, but preserved only in Villa delle Peschiere) were realized by Marcello Sparzo, a member of the school of Giovanni Battista Castello. The rich frescoes at the piano nobile, almost completely preserved, are attributed to Antonio Semino with some interventions by Luca Cambiaso, to whom is also attributed the mythological cycle of frescoes in the lateral rooms.
Landscaping.
The garden, whose original condition is known today thanks to the drawings of Martin-Pierre Gauthier, has been greatly reduced in size in the 19th century when Via Peschiera was built. Part of the garden is still preserved in the area around the villa, which includes the fountain with a statue attributed to Gian Giacomo Vansoldo.

Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz

Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz (born 1973), is an American interdisciplinary artist of Puerto Rican descent born in The Bronx, NY and based in Orlando, FL.
Early life and education.
Raimundi-Ortiz was born to Puerto Rican immigrant parents near the Bronx River Projects. Growing up she was known as a bookworm, "artsy," "the new wave chick," "wanna-be white," and "from the 'hood" until graduating from the arts-target high school that she attended. That intersectionality grew to be reflected in the concepts she works with in her artwork. She graduated from Fashion Institute of Technology in 1995 with an associate degree in illustration. In 2002 she was an artist in residence at Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 2005 she participated in Bronx AIM, a program that exposes and educates emerging artists. She earned her MFA in 2008 from Mason Gross School of Art at Rutgers University.
Career.
Raimundi-Ortiz's early work often examined pop, hip-hop and comic culture, depicting famous people (like Celia Cruz) or her own epic characters (like "Wepa Woman" and "Chuleta") in mural form. But her most notable work is multi-disciplinary or performance-based such as "RicanStruction" that was featured in Performa '05 Biennial creating a pop-up stereotypically Nuyorican beauty parlor. Another of her more interactive performance works was featured in "The Post Millennial Black Madonna," an exhibition at Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts in 2007. In 2011 Raimundi-Ortiz performed her "Hush" series in New York City and at Gyeongnam Art Museum in South Korea. In response to the Pulse shooting, she held a calavera making workshop in Orlando that culminated in a Dia de los Muertos ofrenda. This shrine was exhibited in the National Museum of Mexican Art in Chicago in 2016. Raimundi-Ortiz had work in "Silos", an exhibition at American University in 2016. She was a 2016-17 recipient of a Franklin Furnace Fund. Raimundi-Ortiz is a professor at University of Central Florida.
Ask Chuleta.
Raimundi-Ortiz's performative and political web series, "Ask Chuleta", premiered in 2009. This series consists of short YouTube videos where her comical yet poignant Bronx-based Latina, doobie-wearing character, Chuleta, demystifies and critiques contemporary art and its context. She unpacks identity politics, access and stereotypes through this character. Some of the themes of these videos include, color field painting, post-modernism, Pollock and Kahlo, and Abstract Expressionism and the "white cube". Art critic Benjamin Genocchio says, "It is like a cross between Robert Hughes’s TV series “The Shock of the New” and a novel by Oscar Hijuelos." This work was shown at the Jersey City Museum, amongst other places.
Reinas.
In Raimundi-Ortiz's Reinas series, she explores the archetypical queen character by developing her own version, adorned in invented regalia inspired by personal fears and challenges including "Garbage Queen." This series consisting mostly of performance ephemera and photographic portraits was exhibited in New Jersey at The Gateway Project as part of "(em) POWER DYNAMICS: Exploring the Modes of Female Empowerment and Representation in America."
Pietà.
Raimundi-Ortiz's performance series Pietà centers around the concept of radical empathy. In these performances she embodies a character in the place of Michelangelo's Mary, but instead of holding the dying Jesus, she invites the public, one at a time, to be embraced by her in his place. She created this work to offer an exchange of mourning in response to contemporary global strife and identity-based violence. Through touch, she wants to reach empathy. The first iteration of this performance took place in Knowles Chapel at Rollins College in 2017 where she held thirty-three visitors who identified as part of marginalized communities, each for thirty-three seconds. For this first iteration she collaborated with the University of Central Florida gospel choir, designer Kristina Tollefson and local dj, DJ Stereo 77 to enrich the experience. For the second iteration of her Pieta, Raimundi-Ortiz exhibited at The National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC later the same year, hosting Howard Gospel Choir, costume design by Kristina Tollefson and DJ Stereo 77 as her soundtrack.

Rete Sicula

Rete Sicula (Sicilian Network) referred to all the railway lines in operation and under construction in Sicily which, following the 1885 Conventions, was assigned to the Società per le strade ferrate della Sicilia for operation.
History.
The company, formed with mainly foreign capital by a banking group based in Rome, took the place of the previous companies that ran the island railway lines including the failed Vittorio Emanuele Company, which at the time of taking over had not yet completed the construction programme expected. In 1885 the Sicula Network covered a total of 597 km. The network was gradually integrated with the sections from Palermo to Catania and, in 1895, those between Messina and Fiumetorto of the Palermo - Messina line. At the end of 1896 it had reached 1,093 km. The network was nationalized and incorporated into the Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane in 1905.
Locomotives.
The network was equipped with its own Office for the design of rolling stock. This designed the excellent FS Class 910 locomotive. From 1901 to 1905 the engineer Riccardo Bianchi was the general manager of the company operating the Sicula Network.
Ferries.
The Sicula Network was connected to the Strait of Messina, in November 1893, with the obligation to make two daily ferry trips between Messina and Reggio Calabria. In addition, two daily ferry trips to Villa San Giovanni were established at the time of completion of the Southern Tyrrhenian Railways.
Other railways.
Some lines were not part of the Rete Sicula. These included the Palermo - Marsala - Trapani line (operated from 5 June 1881 by the Società della Ferrovia Sicula Occidentale), the Ferrovia Circumetnea and the Palermo – Corleone railway.

Società per le strade ferrate della Sicilia

The Società per le strade ferrate della Sicilia, better known as Rete Sicula (Sicilian Network) was a company for the construction and operation of the railway lines of Sicily.
History.
The company was formed, mainly with foreign capital, by a banking group with headquarters in Rome, following the agreements of 1885 that divided the Italian railway network into three large corporate groups. It replaced the previous companies that ran the island railway lines, among which was the Vittorio Emanuele Company which, had entered a serious phase of financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy. At the time of the takeover, the planned construction programme had not yet been completed. At 1 May 1876, the length of the Sicilian railway network was 550 kilometres. The Palermo - Marsala - Trapani line came into operation on 5 June 1881 by the Società della Ferrovia Sicula Occidentale. In 1885 the entire Sicilian network extended for a total of 597 km. The newly established company continued its construction programme slowly. In 1895, the Palermo - Messina railway was finally completed and, at the end of 1896, the network of Sicilian railways had reached 1,093 km. From 1901 to 1905 the engineer Riccardo Bianchi was the general director of the company
Ferries.
In November 1893, the company was given the concession for navigation by steam through the Strait of Messina, with the obligation to make two daily ferry trips between Messina and Reggio Calabria. Two daily ferry trips to Villa San Giovanni were established at the time of completion of the Southern Tyrrhenian Railway. In 1894 the company ordered a pair of ferry-boats, with paddle drive and steam engines, which entered service at the end of 1896 as train ferries. The two ferry-ships were the Scilla and the Cariddi. The regular ferry service of freight wagons between Messina and Reggio Calabria began in November 1899 and, on 1 August 1901, the company inaugurated the passenger ferry with two coaches of the Rome-Syracuse direct train.

African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps

The African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps (AAPC) was a unit of the British Army consisting of High Commission Territories (HCT) natives. The AAPC was established in July 1941, after the paramount chiefs of the HCT managed to convince the colonial authorities to create an independent force consisting of their subjects. During its service it provided crucial logistical support to the Allied war effort during the North African, Dodecanese and Italian campaigns. Initially a labor unit, AAPC's duties were gradually expanded to include anti-aircraft artillery operation and other combat duties. It was commanded by Colonel H. G. L. Prynne and numbered 36,000 men, 1,216 of whom died in the war. The last AAPC soldiers were repatriated in spring 1946 and the unit was disbanded in 1949.
Background.
Following the entry of the British Empire into World War II against the Axis powers in 1939, the question of the role that was to be played by its African subjects was to resurface. In July 1940, Britain's largest ally France was knocked out of the war in the Battle of France, creating a risk that the empire would fall short of troops for military operations in Europe and north Africa. Recruitment began in British colonies and the issue of raising armed African units was brought to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for the first time. South African Afrikaners vehemently opposed the arming of black troops, especially if that meant they would fight against white soldiers, insisting that racial segregation be maintained. The decision made by the South African government was extended to the High Commission Territories (HTC) of Swaziland, Basutoland and Bechuanaland. Black Africans were instead to be recruited into labor units so as to enable more Afrikaners to enlist into the Union Defence Force (UDF). On 1 June 1940, amidst much criticism from his political opponents, the South African prime minister, Jan Smuts, authorized the recruitment of non-white troops through the newly formed Directorate of Non-European Army Services (NEAS) into the Cape Corps and the Native Labour Corps. Little by little, Smuts relented to British pressure allowing both white and non-white South African troops to serve outside their homeland, first in East Africa and later in the Middle Eastern and North African campaigns.
South Africa paved the way for the recruitment of manpower in the High Commission Territories and the first unit to benefit from the recruitment drives was the South African Native Police Force (SANPF). Recruitment for the SANPF was halted when the Native Military Guards unit was created by the NEAS directorate and four battalions were to be raised. Low pay and allowances prevented the Native Military Guards from achieving its goals, thus the Native Military Corps was created in its place. Volunteers from the HTCs were permitted to enlist in the Native Military Corps. In July, South Africa requested that 145 men be recruited from each of the territories and HTC nationals working within the country also volunteered. Recruitment was done in cities with the assistance of local chiefs. Minor chiefs, policemen and government employees under the age of 25 were selected on the basis of their potential to become non-commissioned officers. Recruits departed for the NMC Welgedacht training depot in South Africa in September. The first recruitment drive elicited mixed reactions in the High Commission Territories. Concerns were raised about the incorporation of HTC soldiers into the UDF due to its racist policies and the low level of training given to African non-combatants, as had happened during the course of World War I. Despite the fact that training was hampered by language barriers, resident commissioner Charles Arden-Clarke rebuffed any attempt to create separate tribal units. Spearheaded by Kgosi Sechele of Bechuanaland and supported by Seeiso of Basutoland and Sobhuza II, the chiefs eventually managed to separate their subjects from the UDF.
Service.
Between April and May 1941, a large number of Cypriot and Palestinian labor companies were annihilated in the Battle of Greece, exhausting Britain's labor pool in the Middle East. For unknown reasons, Sudanese labor units could only be employed in the vicinity of their homeland. The situation continued to deteriorate as the German "Afrika Korps" swept through north Africa. Britain responded by extending the scope of the Royal Pioneer Corps to include its possessions in west, east and South Africa. In May, military officials began negotiations on the recruitment of pioneers in the HTCs. The mobilization order was communicated through traditional meetings and recruitment for the African Auxiliary Pioneer Corps (AAPC) was launched in late July. The initial goal was for Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland to provide 10,000, 3,000 and 500 men respectively. Terms and conditions of the contracts were to mirror those of the Native Military Corps and resembled those set for mine workers performing heavy manual labor. Pay was lower than in the UDF, as the soldiers received no allowances. A private without dependants received between 2 shillings and 3 pence and a shilling and 6 pence per day, along with food, clothing, accommodation and health services.
Basic training lasted for four weeks and included limited arms training. Upon its completion the soldiers boarded trains to Durban, from which they traveled to the fighting fronts by sea, with stops in Mombasa and Aden. By the time of their October 1941 arrival at the Pioneer Corps depot in Qusassin, the AAPC numbered 18,800 men and was led by Colonel H. G. L. Prynne. Workload was gradually increased over the course of ten days, while equipment was being handed. Only a few men received rifles, most being armed with assegais and knobkieries. Training included driving lessons, vehicle maintenance, shooting practice, cobbling, tailoring and cooking. In December, most of AAPC companies were attached to Ninth Army units in the Nile Delta, Palestine and Syria. The AAPC performed a wide range of manual labor, repairing and demolishing roads, bridges and fortifications (Ras Baalbek and Jdeide). Building railroads from Beirut to Haifa. Tunneling, loading ammunition onto trains, guarding supplies and working as cooks. By 1942, shortages in manpower had led to the employment of AAPC troops in coastal artillery, anti-aircraft artillery, fire services, salvaging operations and garrison duty on the Suez Canal.
On 15 April 1942, a second round of recruitment was launched in the HTCs and the goal was set at 15,000 men. Unlike 1941, army recruiters struggled to attract volunteers and resorted to coercion. In July, the Transvaal Gold Producers Committee agreed to bar jobseekers from the HTCs from applying, to curb the flow of people using the mines to evade conscription. Chiefs who collaborated with the British set up bogus tribal assemblies and men who attended were conscripted. A similar procedure was set at mines, whereby men seeking employment were taken through the back door to army trucks which immediately took them to military installations. When those methods failed to produce results, army recruiters relaxed their medical requirements and began raiding the countryside and abducting able bodied men they came across. A number of recruits were also threatened with land and livestock confiscation. The anti-colonial Basutoland Lekhorlu la Bufo (Commoner's League) was banned and its leaders were imprisoned for demanding that training for the recruits be improved. Draft dodgers migrated to other colonies such as Nyasaland, faked illnesses, inflicted injuries upon themselves and hid in forests and grain silos.
On 1 May 1943, British troopship SS "Erinpura" was torpedoed and sunk, resulting in the loss of 694 men from AAPC's 1919th and 1927th Companies; the unit's worst loss of life during the war. On 12 May, the Allies suppressed the last Axis centers of resistance in North Africa and soon afterwards, the AAPC was renamed the African Pioneer Corps (APC) in recognition of its service to the empire. Once the decision for the Allied invasion of Sicily was made, the APC moved to forward operating bases in Tripoli and Malta. The APC took part in the Sicily landings, providing anti-aircraft cover for Syracuse and smoke screens for the beach landings. On 11 August, five APC servicemen were killed and 26 wounded in a bombing raid on their camp at Lentini. On 9 September, the Eighth Army crossed into mainland Italy and APC troops operated as smoke companies in the battles of Anzio, Salerno and Monte Cassino. APC companies also took part in the Dodecanese campaign. The APC unloaded supplies at the ports of Bari, Brindisi and Taranto, occasionally relieving British field artillery units of their duty.
Towards the end of 1944, Axis air activity over Italy had decreased significantly, leading to the return of APC personnel to their traditional duties. In April 1945, the Eighth Army spearheaded the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy. The APC supported their effort, reaching Trieste and the Austrian border. Germany signed an unconditional surrender on 2 May, ending the fighting on the Italian front but demobilization of the approximately 36,000 APC soldiers was postponed time after time due to shipping shortages. After the end of the war the APC was initially transferred to Palestine, morale suffered and members of the APC struck and conducted small mutinies. The last APC company sailed for home in the spring of 1946 and the unit was disbanded in 1949. A total of 1,216 APC soldiers perished during the war. During the course of the war APC's personnel were awarded two MBEs, seven Military Medals, eight British Empire Medals, 61 were mentioned in dispatches and 23 Commendations.

Sara Sara

Sara Sara is a volcano lying between Lake Parinacochas and the Ocoña River in Peru. It is situated in the Parinacochas Province and the Paucar del Sara Sara Province. The volcano formed during the Pleistocene during four different stages of volcanic activity, which constructed a volcanic edifice with an oval outline consisting of lava flows and lava domes. The volcano was glaciated during the last glacial maximum; it may still feature glaciers. The last eruption was about 14,000 years ago and future eruptions are possible. The volcano was worshipped by the local population, and an Inca mummy of a 15-year old girl was found on the summit by archaeologists.
Geography and geomorphology.
Sara Sara lies within the sub-range of the Andes. Administratively, it is located in the Parinacochas and Paucar del Sara Sara Provinces of the Ayacucho Region, Peru. The town of Pausa lies away from the volcano, and agriculture occurs in the valleys of the area. A disused road passes over the southern flank of the volcano and reaches an elevation of . 
The volcano is high and has an oval outline; the summit lies at the southern end of a north-northwest-south-southeast trending summit ridge. It consists of a complex of lava domes and lava flows superposed on older stratovolcanoes and has a total volume of , with the edifice rising about above the surrounding terrain. The vents are aligned in north-northeast-south-southwest direction and are accompanied by lateral lava domes. These vents were the source of lava flows and block-and-ash flows generated by the collapse of lava domes. Thick ash deposits underlie viscous lava flows that define the "Mollebamba Volcanics" and reach lengths of . A pyroclastic cone of recent age is found on the mountain and a recent lava flow descends the eastern flank. The western flank is heavily eroded. West of the volcano is Lake Parinacochas to its east is the Ocoña River. 
Glaciers.
Glacial cirques, glacial valleys and numerous moraines surround the volcano. Two past glaciations have been described, "Sara Sara II" which descended to about elevation and also encompassed several peaks south of Sara Sara such as the high Cerro Puca Puca, and "Sara Sara I" which has left moraine networks at lower elevations especially on the southwestern flank. The lowest moraines on the western flank occur at while these on the eastern flank only reach , presumably because of the effects of later volcanism that erased other moraines. Some of these encompass closed depressions. A third set of moraines at higher elevations appears to correspond to the neoglacial. The last glacial maximum at Sara Sara occurred between 24,000 and 17,000 years ago and the equilibrium line altitude descended to . 
Presently, it reaches elevation at Sara Sara. The mountain has been called glaciated, with an ice cap covering approximately , and alternatively, it has been stated that it only has a temporary snow cover. Active rock glaciers extend below the snowline on the western and northern flanks, and inactive rock glaciers are found at lower elevations. Water used for irrigation originates at Sara Sara's foot.
Geology.
The Quaternary volcanoes of Peru are part of the Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ) of the Andes and Sara Sara is the northernmost member. The CVZ features consists of two arcs of volcanoes on both sides of the Western Cordillera and features composite volcanoes, lava domes and lava flows, of which El Misti, Huaynaputina, Sabancaya, Ticsani, Tutupaca, Ubinas and Yucamane have been active in historical times. Ampato, Chachani, Casiri, Coropuna and Sara Sara are dormant volcanoes. The volcanism is triggered by the subduction of the Nazca Plate underneath the South America Plate, which takes place off the western coast of South America.
The basement is formed by Precambrian and Paleozoic rocks, which are covered by Mesozoic and Cenozoic sediments and volcanites. The volcano is part of a long, fault-controlled chain of volcanoes, which includes Cerro Grande, Yarihuato, Puca Ccasa, Sara Sara, Puca Puca and Cerro Queñuapunco. A major geological lineament known as the Sara Sara lineament runs across the volcano in northwest-southeast direction. 
A depression west of Sara Sara which contains the Laguna Parinacochas may be the source of the regional Caraveli ignimbrite that was emplaced 8-9 million years ago. This depression constitutes the wide Incahuasi caldera, which may be connected to the magmatic system of Sara Sara.
During its history, Sara Sara has produced andesite, dacite, rhyolite and trachyandesite, with dacite predominating during Quaternary eruptions. The rocks define a potassium-rich calc-alkaline suite. Phenocrysts in the rocks include amphibole, biotite, hornblende, iron-titanium oxide, plagioclase, quartz, sanidine and sphene, and both their quantity and chemistry varied between various stages of activity. The volcaniclastic rocks of Sara Sara define the Sara Sara Formation, a geological formation defined for the western sector of the volcano. The Sara Sara volcanics are sometimes considered part of the Barroso Group of volcanic rocks.
Climate, vegetation and economic activity.
The climate shows altitudinal zonation, with temperatures ranging from in the valleys to freezing temperatures above . Precipitation is seasonal and mostly falls during summer, at higher elevations in the form of hail and snow which covers the ground for months. There are no close weather stations, but above elevation the climate is always cold with temperatures never rising above .
Trees grow at lower elevations, while only ichu and quinua are present above . Alfalfa and maize are cultivated at lower altitudes. Animal husbandry, small commerce and tourism complete the economic activities of the region.
Eruption history.
Sara Sara was active during the last 2 million years and produced the lower Barroso and Lampa Volcanics. Fresh lava and pyroclastic flows imply recent activity. The volcanic activity has been subdivided into four stages:
Two pyroclastic flows dated to 44,500 and 49,200 years before present and lava flows with ages of 340,000±60,000 to 50,000±10,000 years ago. Sara Sara is currently classified as a dormant volcano and there is seismic activity. The occurrence of fumarolic activity was reported in 1963. Hot springs are found northeast of Sara Sara in the Quilcata valley and close to the town of Chacaraya, implying the presence of a shallow magma chamber.
Hazards and monitoring.
The volcano is considered to be "moderately dangerous" by Macedo Sánchez 2016 of the Peruvian Geological Service. Future eruptions may endanger a population of 12,000-8,000 around the volcano, which would be threatened by lahars, pyroclastic flows and tephra fallout. Aside from Pausa, other towns and Lake Parinacochas (an important source of water for the region) are located close to the volcano. Volcano hazard maps have been published. Since 2018, the volcano is monitored by the Peruvian Geological Service; Macedo Sánchez 2016 recommended seismic and other monitoring techniques for Sara Sara.
Archeology and religious importance.
The mountain was worshipped by local populations in and before Inca time, and the Inca performed human sacrifices on it. 
During Inca times it was part of the Kuntisuyu province. 
According to the writings of a cleric Cristóbal de Albornoz, who beginning in 1570 wrote about local religious practices, the local population considered Sara Sara a sacred mountain and offered gold, silver, animals and servants to it. In 1996, archaeologists discovered a burial in a collapsed structure just northeast of the summit and recovered a body. This mummy was nicknamed "Sarita" and appears to be a 15-year old girl. It was accompanied by the remnants of offerings and the ice surrounding the body had melted. Additional offerings such as a llama and a silver object were also recovered from the summit.
Stone walls are found on the ridge at the summit of Sara Sara. They were initially described in 1982 by the archeologist Johan Reinhard, who described them on the northern summit. In 1941, copper objects were found on its flanks. The Yanapunku cave at elevation features bones and ceramics from the Inca and Wari cultures. Incaptiana is a site at the top of a hill at elevation where Inca buildings were identified.

Tianzhou 2

Tianzhou 2 () is a Mission of the Tianzhou-class unmanned cargo spacecraft. The launch took place at 29 May 2021, 12:55:29 UTC. The spacecraft successfully docked with the Tiangong space station later on the same day.
Mission profile.
Tianzhou 2 is a part of the construction of the Tiangong space station, and is the first cargo resupply mission to the already launched "Tianhe" core module (CCM). The spacecraft remained docked to the aft docking port of Tianhe until the concurrent manned mission Shenzhou 12 deorbited in September, after which it was moved to the forward docking port. It will then conduct propellant transfer testing with Tianhe and serve as a test unit for Tianhe's robotic arm to manipulate modules as part of space station construction.
Spacecraft.
The Tianzhou cargo spacecraft has several notable differences with the Tiangong-1 from which it is derived. It has only three segments of solar panels (against 4 for Tiangong), but has 4 maneuvering engines (against 2 for Tiangong).

The Erdős–Tenenbaum–Ford constant is a mathematical constant that appears in number theory. Named after mathematicians Paul Erdős, Gérald Tenenbaum, and Kevin Ford, it is defined as
where formula_2 is the natural logarithm.
Following up on earlier work by Tenenbaum, Ford used this constant in analyzing the number formula_3 of integers that are at most formula_4 and that have a divisor in the range formula_5.
Multiplication table problem.
For each positive integer formula_6, let formula_7 be the number of distinct integers in an formula_8 multiplication table. In 1960, Erdős studied the asymptotic behavior of formula_7 and proved that
