2020 NFL Draft

The 2020 NFL Draft was the 85th annual meeting of National Football League (NFL) franchises to select newly eligible players for the 2020 NFL season. The first round was held on April 23, followed by the second and third rounds on April 24. The draft concluded with rounds 4–7 on April 25. The NFL originally planned to hold the event live in Paradise, Nevada, before all public events related to it were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, all team selections took place via videoconferencing with league commissioner Roger Goodell broadcasting picks from his home.
Format.
The host city was chosen among finalists Denver, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Nashville, and Cleveland/Canton in May 2018 during the NFL Spring League Meeting, when Nashville was chosen to host the 2019 draft. However, the host city for 2020 was deferred. After Denver withdrew, citing scheduling conflicts, Las Vegas was chosen as the original host on December 12, 2018, coinciding with the Las Vegas Raiders' arrival in the city. Plans were announced for a main stage near the Caesars Forum convention center and a "red carpet" stage for arrivals on a floating platform in front of the Bellagio resort, with players being transported to and from the stage by boat. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NFL announced on March 16 that it had canceled all public festivities associated with the event.
Instead, the draft was held remotely, with team coaches and GMs convening via Microsoft Teams due to all team facilities also being closed. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced the picks for rounds 1–3 from his home in Bronxville, New York. During the event Goodell announced that Las Vegas would host the 2022 NFL Draft.

The Big Tour

The Big Tour was the second concert tour by English musical duo Wham!, launched in support of their multi-platinum second studio album "Make It Big" with over six million units sold in the US alone. The tour spanned 4 months between December 1984 and April 1985, comprising 39 shows across the UK, Ireland, Japan, Australia, United States, Hong Kong and China. Wham! made history in China and achieved worldwide publicity by being the first Western pop act to visit the country.
Overview.
The Big Tour opened at Whitley Bay Ice Rink on 4 December. The venue was small due to no other venues being available in the north east, they were booked for two more shows between concerts in Glasgow, Dublin and Leeds. Just as the UK portion of the tour was in its stride, George Michael hurt his back during a performance and the band had to cancel five consecutive shows which were put back until February and March. They continued the UK leg with shows in Wembley Arena during the Christmas period to around 50,000 fans during which “Last Christmas” reached number two in the UK Singles Chart.
The new year began the tour in Japan performing in the Fukuoka Sunpalace with other dates in Osaka, Nagoya, Tokyo and Yokohama. In Australia, five shows followed in Melbourne and Sydney before continuing in the United States, with a sellout concert at the Palladium in front of 4,400 in February 1985. Wham! returned to the United Kingdom with earlier dates having been rescheduled.
Following a month break, the tour resumed in Hong Kong on 2 April 1985. The 10-day visit to China was the first by a Western pop group. The excursion was a publicity scheme devised by Simon Napier-Bell (one of their two managers—Jazz Summers being the other). It began with a concert at the Peoples' Gymnasium in Beijing (then Peking) in front of 13,000 people. They also played a concert in front of 5,000 in Canton. The two concerts were played without compensation.
Wham!'s visit to China attracted huge media attention across the world. Napier-Bell later admitted that he used cunning tactics to sabotage the efforts of British rock band Queen to be the first to play in China: he made two brochures for the Chinese authorities – one featuring Wham! fans as pleasant middle-class youngsters, and one portraying Queen lead singer Freddie Mercury in typically flamboyant poses. The Chinese opted for Wham!.
Recordings.
A documentary film was shot over two weeks in April and edited over summer and autumn 1985 in London. The whole China visit was documented by British film director Lindsay Anderson and producer Martin Lewis in their film "" released in 1986. The first ever public viewing of "Foreign Skies" was shown on large video screens on Saturday 28 June 1986 at the farewell show "The Final".

Polenaktion

Polenaktion ("Polish Action") was the arrest and expulsion of about 17,000 Polish Jews living in Nazi Germany in October 1938. These deportations, ordered by SS officer and head of the Gestapo Reinhard Heydrich, displaced thousands of Polish Jews along the Germany–Poland border.
Origins.
From 1935 to 1938, Jews living within Germany had been stripped of most of their rights by the Nuremberg Laws, and faced intense persecution from the state. As a result, many Jewish refugees sought rapidly to emigrate out of the Reich. However, most countries, still feeling the effects of a global depression, enacted strict immigration laws and simply would not address the refugee problem. According to a census conducted in 1933, over 57 percent of the foreign Jews living in Germany were Polish. The Polish Government, fearing an influx of Jews from the Reich, took drastic steps to isolate its Jewish citizens abroad.
On October 6, 1938, the Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs announced an ordinance requiring that Polish citizens living outside Poland obtain an endorsement stamp on their passports before October 30. Any passport without the stamp would become void and the owner of the passport would have his citizenship rights revoked. When thousands of Polish Jews in Germany presented their passports at Polish consular offices, they were denied the necessary stamp for various reasons. By enacting this decree and denying the stamp to Jews, the Polish Government made it clear that they had no interest in taking in Jews from the Reich, even those who were Polish citizens.
The Polish decree did not please the German Government. In 1938, Nazi policy regarding the Jews was heavily centered on emigration from the Reich rather than the mass extermination that would arise in 1942 during World War II. Thus, Nazi officials saw the Polish decree as a hindrance to their attempts at forcing Jewish emigration. In a letter to Hans Lammers, Chief of the Reich Chancellery, SS Obergruppenfuhrer Werner Best wrote:
Fearing the prospect of thousands of Polish Jews unable to legally emigrate from the Reich, the German Government felt that it had to act. As head of the Gestapo, Heydrich ordered that Polish Jews be expelled from the Reich.
Deportations.
From October 27 until October 29, the day before the Polish decree regarding the eligibility of passports was set to take effect, state authorities in Germany arrested approximately 17,000 Polish Jews and cancelled their German permits of residence. The Gestapo was easily able to locate those arrested through registration data and census files.
After being arrested, thousands of Polish Jews were stripped of any personal property or money and put on trains. These trains brought the deportees to the Germany–Poland border. The Polish border authorities were overwhelmed at first by the unexpected influx of people and during the first day of expulsions they allowed thousands of Polish Jews entry into Poland. However, the Polish Government quickly responded by closing the border down and denying any further access. In the city of Leipzig, 1,300 Polish Jews were able to find refuge in the Polish consulate, assisted there by the Consul General Feliks Chiczewski.
By October 30, thousands of homeless Jews resided in no-man's land along the border. Historians estimate that 4,000 to 6,000 Jews were deported between the southern towns Bytom (then "Beuthen") and Katowice, 1,500 were placed near the northern town of Chojnice, and 8,000 were sent to the town of Zbąszyń (source 2 pp. 123). In Zbąszyń a large refugee camp was established as an attempt to give shelter to those deported. For months, refugees in Zbąszyń slept in poorly constructed barracks with very few provisions. The severity of the conditions within the camp was witnessed by Polish historian Emanuel Ringelblum who described the hopelessness of the refugees in a letter to a colleague.
As a result of the "Polenaktion" of October 1938, most of the 17,000 expelled Jews would remain in refugee camps on the border for almost a year. It was not until just prior to the German Invasion of Poland in 1939 that the refugees of the "Polenaktion" gained access to Poland's interior.
Response of Herschel Grynszpan.
Among those deported on October 27 in Hanover, Germany was the family of Sendel Grynszpan. Grynszpan described police coming to their home on Thursday October 27, demanding that they go to the nearest precinct with their Polish passports. When they arrived, hundreds of people were waiting for further instructions. The police notified the crowd that they were to sign papers and present their passports. After doing so they were placed in police vans, taken to a train station, and forced onto the cars. On Saturday October 29, the Grynszpan family arrived in Zbąszyń, confused and scared.
On October 31, Sendel Grynszpan's daughter Berta was able to send a post card from Zbąszyń to her brother Herschel Grynszpan in Paris. The post card, which detailed the cruelty and tragedy of the family's forced relocation reached Grynszpan. Horrified and distressed by the plight of his family and the thousands of other Polish Jews, Grynszpan took it upon himself to enact revenge. Purchasing a pistol, he went to the German Embassy in Paris on November 7. There he shot and ultimately killed First Secretary of the Reich, Ernst vom Rath.
The assassination of vom Rath stunned the Nazi regime. On November 9 and 10 Jewish businesses, properties, and synagogues were destroyed, burned, and looted across the Reich, with the assassination being used by the Nazis as a pretext. This event, often referred to as Kristallnacht is often seen by historians as a key moment of significance in the formulation of the Holocaust.

Édouard Nignon

Édouard Nignon (9 November 1865, Nantes - 30 October 1934, Bréal-sous-Montfort) was a French chef and writer of cookbooks.
Life.
One of eight children of a day laborer and a seamstress, Nignon became an apprentice at Cambronne Restaurant at the age of 9. A year later, he joined Monier Restaurant, where he learned to read and write. After more work in Angers and Cholet, he arrived to Paris, where he assisted famous chefs and eventually became a chef himself.
He lived in Austria and Russia, where he served the highest dignitaries, including the emperors Nicholas II of Russia and Franz Joseph I of Austria. He worked as the chef of Claridge's in London from 1894 to 1901. In 1908, he bought Larue Restaurant in Paris. He retired in 1928.
When his restaurant was going through a crisis in World War I, he started writing cookbooks. His most famous cookbook, "Eulogies of French Cuisine", was published in 1933. It promoted deglazing with water, clear broths, and parsimonious seasoning.
Nignon is credited with inventing the "beuchelle tourangelle", a veal kidney and rice stew inspired by the Austrian "beuschel" stew. Interested in unusual taste combinations, he created oysters with camembert and "homard a la dinardaise", a lobster salad with the "insane trio" of truffles, mustard and pickles.
Legacy.
Ignored by the general public, Nignon has been recognized by chefs as one of the fathers of modern cuisine. His legacy has been revived after a long period of being eclipsed by his more famous contemporary, Auguste Escoffier.
Michel Guérard, one of the founders of "nouvelle cuisine", described Nignon as a visionary chef who had a huge influence on French cooks such as himself and Joël Robuchon. A recent article on contemporary cookbooks called Nignon "the Flaubert of the ovens," who created "gourmet epics". His "Eulogies" were called a "seminal book" of "bourgeois cuisine."
An original copy of Nignon's "Heptameron" was sold for 16 thousand euros in the 2010s.
Chef Yvon Garnier founded Culinary Institute Edouard Nignon in Nantes.

Ted Thomas (rower)

Evan David "Ted" Thomas (23 July 1894 – March 1943), listed as Edward Thomas in another source, was a South Australian rower. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight.
Club and state rowing.
Ted Thomas was a storekeeper and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Thomas rowed in those crews at five in 1920 &amp; 21 and in the two seat in 1922 &amp; 23 and rowed in each of those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923.
International representative rowing.
The South Australian media pushed for Thomas' victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Thomas and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Thomas' son, Ted Thomas jnr, asserted in a commemorative speech that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Thomas) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Thomas in the two seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Thomas did not row on after the Olympics.

Erebus Chalice

The Erebus Chalice is a silver and gilt chalice gifted to the National Science Foundation in 1987 for use in the Chapel of the Snows at McMurdo Station in Antarctica, where it is now kept on display during austral summers. At the time of its gifting, the Chalice was believed to have been carried aboard (and thus named after) , which, alongside , was one of two ships of the Ross Expedition that mapped Antarctica in 1839–1843.
In 2006 the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch discovered that the chalice actually had been made in London circa 1910 and therefore could not have sailed aboard "Erebus".

NGC 4570

NGC 4570 is an edge-on lenticular galaxy located about 57 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. NGC 4570 was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on April 13, 1784 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster.
Structure.
NGC 4570 has a nuclear disc that extends to a radius of about ~. In between the nuclear disk and the surrounding two stellar rings and the outer disk, there is a gap that separates the outer edge of the nuclear disk and the inner edge of the main disk by about ~. This multi-disc structure may have been shaped through secular evolution induced by a small nuclear bar. However, observations of the globular clusters surrounding NGC 4570 have found a significant population with ages ranging from about 1–3 billion years. Surprisingly, the estimated ages of the young globular clusters appears to be in good agreement with the estimated age of the stellar population of the nuclear disc (≤2 Gyr). This suggests that the young globular clusters and the nuclear disc instead formed from a merger or accretion event which involved significant amounts of gas and triggered a strong starburst in the galaxy.
Globular Clusters.
About 120 globular clusters have been detected surrounding NGC 4570.

Episcopal Palace, Fiesole

The Episcopal Palace () is a building located in Piazza Mino of Fiesole, Italy. Built in the eleventh century, it serves as the residence of the Bishop of Fiesole.
History.
At the front of the Episcopal Palace is a double staircase constructed in the 19th century. The palace was built contemporaneously with the adjacent Fiesole Cathedral in 1028, under the episcopate of Bishop Jacopo Bavaro. Over time, the palace was modified and expanded.
In the fourteenth century, the palace was enlarged by Bishop Andrew Corsini, and subsequently by Bishops Francesco Maria Ginori and Cattani da Diacceto. The coat of arms of Bishop Filippo Neri Altoviti is prominently positioned above the entrance to the palace due to his expansion. The current façade dates to 1500.
Inside the palace is the bishop's private chapel, which contains frescoes in the Ghirlandaio school from the late 15th century, depicting Saint Romulus, Saint James, and God the Father.
Also inside is the Oratory of San Jacopo Maggiore, which was built by Bishop Cattani da Diacceto. In it is a piece by Lorenzo di Bicci depicting the "Coronation of the Virgin". There are also paintings by Niccodemo Ferrucci and Antonio Marini.
To the right of the Episcopal Palace is a rectory that was built in 1032 to house the canons of the cathedral next door. In 1439, it was expanded, adding a courtyard surrounded by an arcade and a marble column in the center with a small, metal image of "Maria Santissima", which was commissioned by Bishop Ranieri Mancini.
In the palace's garden are the remains of an Etruscan wall that continues into the garden of the adjacent Episcopal Seminary, which once supported the lower circle of the acropolis on which the San Francesco Monastery now resides.

Pangra

The Pangra is an American kit car based on the Ford Pinto and produced from 1972–1973. The Pangra is the brainchild of Jack Stratton, then general sales manager at Huntington Ford in Arcadia, California. Production estimates vary but somewhere in the range of 20–50 complete cars were built, although many partial kits were sold as well, with estimates for those hovering in the hundreds.
History.
The Pangra was based on the Ford Pinto, a car which came about prior to the 1970s oil crisis and the subsequent move away from muscle cars. Jack Stratton, the Pangra's creator, wanted to build a fast, compact car that could compete with cars such as the Porsche 914 and Datsun 240Z. Stratton developed the car with Huntington Ford and the cars were all sold through the dealership. Most Pangras were based on the 2-door sedan and hatchback body styles of the Pinto, although there were a few Pangras based on the 2-door station wagon as well. The Pangra appeared on the cover of the January, 1973 issue of "Motor Trend" where it was tested against the Porsche 914.
Variants.
The Pangra could either be had as one of 4 different kits or it could be bought as a complete car from Huntington Ford with all of the equipment already installed. Kit 1 included the distinctive fiberglass front end with a revised hood, grill, fenders and hidden headlights operated by a lever in the interior. Kit 2 included all of kit 1 plus a revised interior including the dash, console and Stewart-Warner gauges including a digital tachometer, machined "Mag-Shot" wheels and bigger tires measuring 175HR13s in the front and 185HR13s at the rear. Kit 3 included everything from the first two kits as well as a Spearco "Can Am" kit which featured shortened front coil springs, heavy duty front and rear sway bars, a rear lowering kit and a full set of KONI shock absorbers. Kit 4 is the most remembered of the 4 and featured all 3 previous kits and featured an AK Miller turbocharger kit bolted to the original 2.0 liter SOHC 4 cylinder, as well as other engine upgrades bringing power up to around . In addition to these kits, complete Pangras assembled at Huntington Ford also received Recaro high-back bucket seats as well as a custom console and dashboard, which could not be ordered as part of any of the kits.
Performance.
The Kit 4 Pangras are powered by the carbureted 2.0 liter SOHC 4 cylinder used in the Pinto but have been modified with 7:1 compression, water injection, revised header pipe, crossover intake, an O-ringed head and the aforementioned AK Miller turbocharger kit. The Pangra reportedly did 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 7.5 seconds and made around at around 10 pounds of boost, giving it 1.42 horsepower per cubic inch. The car also could pull 0.74g on track thanks to its upgraded suspension, with "Motor Trend" saying the car "clings like Saran wrap". The Pangra was an early adopter of turbocharging, lacking an intercooler or any sort of device to control boost. Instead, boost was regulated by welding a washer into the exhaust to limit the amount of air which could come through. Due to this, long term reliability of these engines suffered according to accounts from owners.

Early life.
Ronald J. Pestritto graduated from Claremont McKenna College with a bachelor of arts degree in government in 1990. He earned a PhD in Political Science from the Claremont Graduate University in 1996.
Career.
Pestritto was an assistant professor at Saint Vincent College from 1997 to 1999. He taught at the University of Dallas from 1999 to 2006, where he became a tenured associate professor in 2002. He joined Hillsdale College in 2006, and became a full professor in 2012. He has been the dean of the Graduate School since 2010, and he is also the Charles and Lucia Shipley chair in the American Constitution. Additionally, he is affiliated with the Claremont Institute, and he has published articles in its "Claremont Review of Books".
Pestritto is the author of two books. His first book, "Founding the Criminal Law: Punishment and Political Thought in the Origins of America", "is about penal reform and the philosophy of punishment as both were debated in postrevolutionary America." In a review for the "American Political Science Review", Amy Bunger of Florida State University praised the book for its contextualization of ideas, and added that it could do with more historical examples and policy implementations on a state level. Reviewing it for "The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science", Jeffrey Reiman of American University was more critical, dismissing Pestritto's conclusion based on the work of Ramsey Clark and Karl Menninger as "out of date" by three decades. His second book, "Woodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism", influenced television personality Glenn Beck.
Pestritto is also the editor of five books, three of which he co-edited with Thomas G. West, one of his colleagues at Hillsdale College.
Pestritto supported Donald J. Trump during the 2016 presidential election.

Yellow Turban Army

The Yellow Turban Army, also known as the Yellow Turban Bandits (after the publishing of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms), was a peasant rebel force led by the late Eastern Han Dynasty mystic Zhang Jue from Julu Commandery. The Yellow Turbans launched an uprising against the central government in 184, the year of the Jiazi in the Sexagenary cycle. The Yellow Turban Rebellion became one of the biggest rebellions in Chinese history, but it was mostly quelled within a year by the Eastern Han government. As result, the Chinese historiography has always placed it as the progenitor of the Three Kingdoms Era. Some Yellow Turban factions continued their insurgency for decades, however, and the last known remnants of the movement were defeated in the first decade of the 3rd century.
Yellow Turban Army.
The Yellow Turban Army was composed of commoners, rabble and other people of opportunity. Zhang Jue and his brothers Zhang Bao and Zhang Liang treated many of them, and thus were very popular. When Zhang Jue saw that followers of the Way of the Taiping grew more numerous by the day, he openly revolted in the large-scale Yellow Turban Rebellion. The scale of the Rebellion involved almost a million people, Zhang Jue passed away during the rebellion, with his brothers falling in battle. The Rebellion was put down within the year, but laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty.
Impact.
The Rebellion may have been put down within the year, but it laid the foundations of the fall of the Eastern Han Dynasty. The central government handed local officials immense authority with regards to the recruitment of soldiers, which resulted in the warlordism of the late Eastern Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms Era, undeniably a fatal blow to the Eastern Han. The Rebellion accelerated the demise of the Eastern Han, and even after the defeat of the rebellion, small scale conflicts continued under the Yellow Turban banner along the Yellow River. This is also why the Yellow Turban Rebellion is often documented in Chinese historiography as the beginning of the Three Kingdoms Era.

A Nervous Breakdown

"A Nervous Breakdown" () is an 1889 short story by Anton Chekhov.
Publication.
The story first appeared in the charity compilation "In the Memory of V.M. Garshin" (Памяти В. М. Гаршина), published in Saint Petersburg in January of that year. In a revised version it made its way into another collection, "Moody People" (Хмурые люди, Khmurye lyudi, 1890). With some further edits, Chekhov included it into Volume 5 of his Collected Works, published by Adolf Marks in 1899–1901. During its author's lifetime the story was translated into German, Serbo-Croatian and Swedish languages.
Plot summary.
Vasilyev, a law student, is persuaded by his friends Meyer and Rybnikov to take an evening cruise through the Lane, a red light district in Moscow. As they move from one brothel to another, Vasilyev gets more and more distressed with what he sees. Disgusted with the general air of apathy and indifference, he tries to strike up conversations with the women but is shocked by the dullness of the response. His attempts at constructing a more or less logical picture of the inner mechanism of this place, and the motivations behind it, fail too.
Vasilyev returns home overwhelmed with the feelings of guilt, shame and disgust. Here, feeling the symptoms of the approaching nervous breakdown, a condition familiar to him, he spends a sleepless night trying to come up with some kind of project to 'save' all those women who apparently fail to see that they have been reduced to the status of animals. Two days later, delirious and mumbling of suicide, he is delivered by his friends to the psychiatrist Mikhail Sergeyevich.
Vasilyev tries to speak about the plight of those 'fallen' women, but gets lukewarm response from the specialist. Still, the prolonged talk, combined with some medicine he takes, make him feel better. He departs, with the receipts for potassium bromide and morphine. More or less calmed down, he feels confused and quite ashamed of his unnecessary outbreak.
Background.
In March 1888 Russia was shocked by the news of the tragic death of Vsevolod Garshin. The writer, noted for his sensitivity to social injustice and great compassion to suffering people, died in hospital five days after he threw himself down the stairwell from the fourth floor of the house he lived in. Almost immediately two groups of writers started to collect money for the Garshin monument, as well as literary tributes. One, centered around the newspaper "Novosti", was headed by Kazimir Barantsevich, another, organized by the staff of "Severny Vestnik", by Alexey Pleshcheyev.
On 19 March Barantsevich asked Chekhov by post to contribute to the collection. "Whatever you will, regardless whether it had been published before or not, anything would be welcome," he wrote. The following day Chekhov sent an enthusiastic reply, promising to "send something for the collection" and noting that such ideas, "beside their direct goal, serve as a uniting force for the writers' community which, even if not numerous, are still disparate. The more shoulder to shoulder feeling we'll have, the more we'll support each other, the sooner we'll learn to value and respect one another." 
On 30 March Pleshcheyev too asked Chekhov to provide some work for his tribute to Garshin, mentioning the "Novosti"-related project, in a rather negative light, characterizing it as superficial. For a time being the hope remained that the two parties would join forces, then the disagreements became obvious and Chekhov in another letter to Pleshcheyev expressed his disappointment with the split. Still, he decided to respond to the latter's request and ignore the Barantsevich-edited collection.
On 15 September Chekhov wrote to Pleshcheyev: "It would be a shame for me to fail to respond to your request, for... [people like Garshin] are very dear to me... But I do not have not a single [story at the moment] that would fit such a collection... Probably just one little idea: a young man, a Garshin type, strong personality, honest and deeply sensitive, finds himself in a brothel for the first time in his life. Serious things demand serious treatment, so I intend to be quite straightforward about it. But what if I will be able to make it a depressive read, which is indeed my intention, and it will turn out good enough to make into the collection? Can you guarantee, that the censors or the editorial staff itself won't throw away from it things that I myself regard as important?.. If you can, I promise to write the story in the course of two evenings." 
In response, Pleshcheyev promised "that will be an uncensored collection" and not a single word will be changed by the editors. On 9 October 1888 Chekhov informed Pleshcheyev that he was going to start writing the next day, and will finish it in a week. Yet it took him a month to complete the story. "You are killing us... For God's sake, please hurry up," Pleshcheyev implored him in the 2 November letter. "The work is on its way, and 1/4 of it is ready... I describe here the Sobolev Lane with its brothels, but carefully, without wallowing in mud or resorting to strong language," Chekhov assured him on 3 November. On November 10, he added: "I try to be modest, to the point of boredom. The subject matter seems to me to be so delicate, that any detail could be easily exaggerated into elephantine proportions. I hope my story won't stick out of this collection's general picture. It is sad, dour and serious." 
On 11 November in a letter to Alexey Suvorin he wrote: "Today I finished the story for the Garshin memorial collection, and that's huge relief... Why don't you ever say anything in your newspaper about prostitution? For it is a horrible evil. Our Sobolev Lane is a slave market."
Finally, on 13 November the story was sent to Pleshcheyev. "By no means a family read, very ungracious... But my conscience is now clear. The promise fulfilled, besides, I gave the late Garshin the kind of credit I wanted to, and was capable of. As a medic, I think I've described this psychological ailment the right way, in terms of the psychological science. As for the girls, in the days gone by I used to be quite an authority in this matter."
Upon receiving "A Nervous Breakdown", Pleshcheyev sent Chekhov a letter. "I liked this story for its seriousness, reserve, and the idea as such. Still we are here all wary of censorship, it does not like this subject being touched at all. Guards chastity with all the severity." His premonitions as to possible problems with censorship proved right later, in 1902, when the fifth volume of the Collected Works by A.P. Chekhov published by Marks, was banned from public libraries and reading-halls, and "A Nervous Breakdown" was cited among the three short stories deemed politically incorrect. "[It] sermonizes against prostitution, but at the same time implies that any single man's attempts to fight this evil are doomed to be futile," a member of the Education ministry's Scientific committee Evgraf Kovalevsky explained.
Critical reception.
In general, the story was positively reviewed. Among those who lauded it were Ivan Gorbunov-Posadov and Dmitry Grigorovich, who on 27 December 1888 sent Chekhov a letter containing a thorough analysis of the novella (as he called it). He praised the story's "noble humanism" as well as the descriptions of nature. "The literary community, students, Evreyinova, Pleshcheyev, women and others praised my Breakdown to high heavens, but only Grigorovich spotted the first snow episode," wrote Chekhov in his 23 December 1888 letter to Suvorin. Later, in the 3 January letter, he enquired: "Why haven’t you spoken a single word on "In the Memory of Garshin"? This is unfair." Whether Suvorin replied by letter or not, is unknown, but "Novoye Vremya", which originally ignored the compilation, responded in its own way, by publishing in January 1889 a negative review, by Viktor Burenin, which outraged Pleshcheyev. 
On 22 December 1888 "Novosti i Birzhevaya Gazeta" (The News and the Stockbroker Gazette) briefly commented on the release of both of the Garshin tributes. "Even if no masterpieces are to be found in them, you'll come across fine stories as "Raven the Petitioner" by Shchedrin, "Nervous Breakdown" by An. Chekhov or "On the Volga" by V. Korolenko which you'll read with delight," Alexander Skabichevsky wrote. There were two reviews (on 29 December 1888, and 5 January 1889) of the collection in "Novosti Dnya" (News of the Day), both pointing at "Nervous Breakdown" as its strongest piece. After the third edition of the "Moody People" collection came out, the magazine "Trud" reviewed it, again pointing at "A Nervous Breakdown" as its outstanding feature.

PopSockets

PopSockets LLC is a privately owned consumer-electronics accessory company that produces removable grips for smartphones. The company was founded in 2012 by David Barnett, who was at the time a philosophy professor.
Overview.
In 2014, the first year of sales, PopSockets LLC sold 30,000 PopSockets grips. In 2017, PopSockets LLC sold 35 million PopSockets grips. In 2018, PopSockets LLC sold 60 million PopSockets grips. They have sold a total of over 100 million Popsockets grips.
In 2018, PopSockets LLC's revenue was over US$200 million, with a profit of over US$90 million.
In August 2018, PopSockets LLC was listed as #2 on the Inc. 5000 list of the fastest-growing companies in America.
PopSockets LLC employs over 200 people, in Boulder, San Francisco, Finland, and Singapore. PopSockets LLC has partnerships with production facilities in China, South Korea, Mexico, and Seattle.
History.
In January 2012, Barnett started a Kickstarter campaign for an iPhone 4 case with a device on the back that could be used to store earbuds. In March 2012, Barnett signed an exclusive licensing agreement with Case-Mate, but the agreement later fell through. Because of the resulting delay, Barnett announced in September 2012 that he would be developing an iPhone 5 case instead of an iPhone 4 case. He also announced that he would be developing a product that, at the time, was called "PopSockets for All"—this is a PopSockets grip that sticks to one's phone or tablet via a repositionable sticky gel pad. He was interested in finding a way to store his headphones without them getting tangled. This individual PopSockets grip has been the best-selling product of the company.
PopSockets LLC started selling products in January 2014, via direct sales on its website. In 2015, PopSockets LLC signed its first major retail deal, with T-Mobile. PopSockets reached a high level of popularity in 2017, becoming what Slate Magazine called a well-known "love it or hate it" gadget, like the fidget spinner.
PopSockets LLC's revenue grew by 71,424 percent from mid-2015 to mid-2018; this growth was achieved without venture capital investment.
In March 2019, PopSockets LLC moved its headquarters to a 46,000-square-foot building in Boulder, Colorado.
Early controversy.
PopSockets grips were featured on a September 2012 segment of NPR's radio show "All Things Considered", entitled "When A Kickstarter Campaign Fails, Does Anyone Get The Money Back?". The segment discussed how Barnett refunded 40 of his 500 Kickstarter backers, due to the delays in production. Regarding the refunds, Barnett was quoted as saying "I think it sets a bad precedent. ... Once I did that, I could tell that it started creating the impression in some of my backers that they had purchased an item. And I think as Kickstarter grows, there's more and more of an impression that it's just a big store for people to go get deals." Barnett's production delays were also discussed on CNN.
Products.
The main product sold by PopSockets LLC is the PopSockets grip. The PopSockets grip is designed to allow easier handling of the phone. The PopSockets grip also functions as a stand, to prop a phone up while watching video. PopSockets LLC also sells the PopSockets mount, which enables one to temporarily mount one's phone on a vertical surface, such as a car dashboard or wall. In February 2018, the company started selling the PopSockets vent mount, which clips onto the air vent of a vehicle.
PopSockets LLC also sells PopMinis (miniature PopSockets grips, sold in sets of three), PopWallets (designed to hold up to three credit cards or driver's licenses) and PopMirrors (phone grips with two mirrors).
In October 2018, the company started selling swappable PopSockets grips, called "PopGrips", where the top portion of the grip, called a "PopTop", can be removed and replaced with another PopTop.
Starting in Spring of 2019, in conjunction with Otterbox, PopSockets LLC will be selling the Otter+Pop phone case, an Otterbox case with an integrated PopTop. This case won a USA Today CES Editors' Choice award.
PopSockets LLC has plans in the future to sell swappable grips with integrated external batteries, sensors, and trackers. PopSockets LLC announced plans for making products compatible with the iPhone 12 mag safe feature. 
Intellectual property protection.
PopSockets LLC has faced significant problems with counterfeits (fakes branded as "PopSockets") and knock-offs (which don't use the term "PopSockets", but copy the design of PopSockets grips and hence violate patents). In 2017 and 2018, PopSockets LLC's brand protection team was working with online marketplaces around the world to remove 1,000 to 2,000 listings daily. Amazon had to develop new protocols to deal with the volume of fake PopSockets grips on the Amazon Marketplace.
In 2018, PopSockets LLC spent over US$7 million on intellectual property protection, working with over 40 lawyers worldwide.
In June 2018, PopSockets LLC won a General Exclusion Order (GEO) from the US International Trade Commission, prohibiting the importation into America of products that infringe on PopSockets's 2013 patent entitled "Extending Socket for Portable Media Player".
Amazon dispute.
In November 2018, PopSockets LLC stopped selling PopSockets grips on amazon.com, due to pricing disputes with Amazon. Amazon changed its policy, so that brands like PopSockets could not sell directly on the Amazon Marketplace, but could only sell items to Amazon at wholesale cost; Amazon would then be the seller and determine the retail cost. PopSockets LLC wanted to maintain pricing parity with other retailers (like Target and Best Buy) who sell PopSockets grips, and as a result PopSockets LLC decided not to sell PopSockets grips to Amazon at all.
Philanthropy.
In November 2018, PopSockets LLC launched a major philanthropic program called "Poptivism", where for each PopSockets grip sold through the Poptivism platform, 50% of the sale is donated to the non-profit assigned to it by its creator. One of the celebrities who has promoted a Poptivism grip is the American actress and singer Zendaya; sales from her grip support the charity FoodCorps. PopSockets LLC also partnered with Teen Vogue to support the gun violence charity March for Our Lives.
In the past PopSockets LLC was a "Let's Get a Grip on Arthritis" sponsor, and donated 10 percent of its online net proceeds from January through March 2018 to the Arthritis Foundation. PopSockets LLC received recognition from the Arthritis Foundation for the utility of PopSockets grips for people with arthritis.

Kathleen Hamm

Kathleen M. Hamm (born February 2, 1963) is an American lawyer, federal regulator and fintech and cybersecurity expert, formerly a Board Member of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, and Counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury for cyber policy and financial regulation. In April 2021, her alma mater, University at Buffalo School of Management, named her Accountant of the Year. 
She was the Global Leader of Securities and Fintech Services and Senior Strategic Adviser on Cyber Solutions to the Chief Executive Officer of Promontory Financial Group, a wholly owned subsidiary of IBM. Hamm was a pioneer in developing processes to embed regulatory requirements and cybersecurity into business operations and controls, changing how business systems are developed and improving their consumer protection. After leaving public service, Hamm established Pearl Advisory Group, LLC. She serves on the boards of The Reserve Trust Company, Inc., a financial institution; the Long-Term Stock Exchange, Inc., a new exchange focusing on long-term value creation; and Manetu, Inc., a startup privacy management platform. She also is a member of the Duke University School of Law Board of Visitors; the Duke Law School Global Financial Markets Advisory Board, the Steering Committee of the Climate Risk Disclosure Lab at Duke University; and the Dean’s Advisory Council for the University at Buffalo School of Management, SUNY.
Early life and education.
Hamm was born on February 2, 1963 in Albany, NY. She graduated from the University at Buffalo, SUNY, in 1985 with a B.S., summa cum laude, with distinction, majoring in business administration, concentrating in accounting; from Duke University School of Law in 1988 with a J.D., with honors; and from Georgetown University Law Center in 1994 first in her class, with an LL.M. in Securities Regulation, with distinction.
Career.
Hamm was appointed to the Board of the PCAOB in January 2018 by the Commissioners of the Securities and Exchange Commission, after consultation with the chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the secretary of the Treasury. She earned a reputation for using the bully pulpit to increase auditors’ focus on cybersecurity, especially when conducting their risk assessments, and left the Board in November 2019 after completing her term. Under a new Biden Administration, in 2021, a "Financial Times" commentator, among others, called for Hamm to be reappointed to the Board.
She joined the PCAOB from Promontory Financial Group, where she was the Global Leader of Securities and Fintech Services and Senior Strategic Adviser on Cyber Solutions to the Chief Executive Officer, Eugene Ludwig, from February 2017 to January 2018. This was her second time working at Promontory, where she started out as a Managing Director, building the securities practice (October 2004 to September 2014). She was an early advocate for exchanges, hedge funds and global companies to improve their regulatory compliance and cybersecurity by embedding their legal requirements into their operations and control environments. In between the two positions at Promontory, Hamm served as Counselor to the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of Treasury for cyber policy and financial regulation (September 2014 to January 2017). At Treasury, she also represented the United States on a cybersecurity expert group impaneled by the G7 finance ministers and central bank governors.
From 2001 to early 2004, Hamm served as the Senior Vice President in Charge of Regulation and Compliance for the Nasdaq-Liffe Markets(NQLX), which closed in December 2004. She worked briefly (2000 to 2001) at Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &amp; Rosati, P.C., as a securities attorney; and at Streich, Lang, Weeks &amp; Cardon, P.A. (1988 to 1990), as a corporate and securities associate.
She started her career at the SEC in the Division of Enforcement (1991 to 2000) as a Staff Attorney and Senior Counsel (1991 to 1995), then a Branch Chief (1995 to 1997), and an Assistant Director (1997 to 2000).
Professional memberships and activities.
Hamm is a Member of the Bar in the District of Columbia, California, and Arizona. She is a Member of the Duke Law School Board of Visitors and the Duke Law School Global Financial Markets Advisory Board. Hamm also serves on the Dean’s Advisory Council for the University at Buffalo School of Management, SUNY.

Nicolas Astrinidis (Greek: ; Cetatea Albă; 6 May 1921– Thessaloniki, 10 December 2010) was a Romanian-born Greek composer, pianist, conductor, and educator.
After receiving diplomas in piano performance and composition from the Schola Cantorum de Paris, Astrinidis embarked on an international career as pianist (soloist or accompanist). During the 1950s and the early 1960s, he toured East Asia and the Americas, performing in cities, such as Evanston and Hong Kong. He collaborated with renowned performers of the period, such as violinists Jacques Thibaud, Henryk Szeryng, Colette Frantz, and cellist Bernard Michelin. In 1949, Riccordi Americana published two of his piano works: "Danse Grecque", and "Deux Préludes".
His symphonic music includes the oratorios "Saint Demetrios" (1962), "The Youth of Alexander the Great", "Cyril and Methodius" (1966), the choral "Symphony "1821"" (1971), the 
"Cypriot Rhapsody", three concertos: "Variations Concertantes" for piano and orchestra (1952–55), "Concerto-Rhapsody" for violin and orchestra (1979), and "Concerto pour Guitare et Orchestre" (2007).
A tribute to Astrinidis, with the composer talking about and performing his music, was held in New York City in 2004. In 2006, excerpts from his "Symphony 1821" were performed in New Brunswick. In December 2020, pianist Stephanos Katsaros launched a 12-part mini-documentaries with live performances of Astrinidis' piano and chamber music works.

Battle of Al Masini valley

The battle of Al Masini valley, code named Operation Al Faisal by the coalition, was an operation to clear the Al-Qaeda controlled stronghold of Al Misini valley in Hadramut province.
Battle.
On February 17, 2018 Hadrami Elite Forces, backed by heavy UAE aerial support, launched Operation Al-Faisal, an offensive to retake Al-Masini Valley from AQAP militants. The offensive began when Hadrami Elite Forces launched a preemptive attack from three directions, that laid siege to all AQAP militants in the valley. On February 18 Hadrami Elite Forces had entered the valley and begun to slowly retake all areas in and around the valley. After fierce fighting for 48 hours, AQAP militants retreated from the valley and Hadramai forces gained full control over an operation room that was run by AQAP militants in the valley and confiscated the equipment and ammunition used by the terror group in carrying out its criminal operations. The governor of Hadhramaut, Major General Faraj al-Bahsani declared that the operation was a success and that others like it, will follow until the region was fully rid of AQAP. Furthermore, while combing the area, large caches of ammunition, including mortar guns and missiles were found and the Yemeni forces secured the entire zone by staging military posts and patrol units across the surrounding plateaus to preempt any counter offensives by the AQAP militants.
Aftermath.
After AQAP retreated, Hadrami Elite chased them for several kilometers before ceasing pursuit and establishing positions and checkpoints.

2018 Cyprus gas dispute

The 2018 Cyprus gas dispute is a diplomatic dispute involving the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Republic of Cyprus (in partnership with Greece and Egypt) in the eastern Mediterranean, which began on February 6, 2018. The dispute followed remarks made by Turkey's foreign minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, rejecting a 2003 Cypriot-Egyptian maritime border demarcation deal and announcing the Turkish government's intention to carry out gas exploration in the region. Tensions in the region further escalated on February 9, when the Turkish Navy blocked a drill ship operated by Italian oil company Eni S.p.A., licensed by the government of the Republic of Cyprus, from exploring gas reserves off the island.
Çavuşoğlu said during his interview with the Greek newspaper "Kathimerini" that Turkish Cypriots have "undeniable rights" to the Cypriot EEZ. Egypt's Foreign Ministry reacted by warning Turkey not to contest the 2013 deal and Egyptian economic interests in the region, adding that any attempts to do so would be confronted. The Cypriot government officials have emphasised that any future benefits are for all Cypriots, including the Turkish Cypriots, but only after a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem. On February 16, Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi stated that the Turkish blockade of its drill ship, Saipem 12000, was out of Eni's hands and that the issue was being discussed by involved parties. In November 2018, the partnership of the Cypriot government and US company ExxonMobil successfully began carrying out hydrocarbon exploration, escorted by US Navy ships, with Turkey remaining passive.
Background.
In the early 1970s, the Republic of Cyprus (RoC) gave oil companies permission to search the island's waters for hydrocarbons, and the first exploration started in 1977. Earlier, in 1974, Turkey invaded Cyprus, leaving in its wake an unresolved ethnic dispute and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) occupying the northern part of the island, which is only recognized by Turkey.
In 2002, the Turkish Navy prevented "Northern Alliance", a ship operated by a RoC-commissioned Norwegian company, from exploring the Cypriot EEZ. In 2003, the governments of Cyprus and Egypt signed maritime border agreement delineating their respective EEZs. Cyprus also signed a similar agreement with the government of Lebanon in January 2007. Later that same month, the RoC defined thirteen zones (named "Blocks") in its EEZ, and invited tenders for eleven of them in the following months. Turkey, a non-signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, claims Block 3 of the Cypriot EEZ as part of its continental shelf.
In November 2008, a Turkish Navy vessel was involved in a standoff with two ships operated by Norwegian company Petroleum Geo-Services, a day before the Turkish Petroleum Corporation was given Ankara's permission to explore waters claimed by the Cypriot government. Three days later, the RoC found "Malene Ostervold", a Norwegian-flagged ship commissioned by Turkey, surveying the region's waters. Ankara believes the Turkish Cypriot community should be allowed to benefit from the island's offshore resources. In 2014, Turkey deployed two warships to the Cypriot EEZ and started conducting seismic surveys in the region. Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades responded by suspending unification talks with his Turkish Cypriot counterpart, Derviş Eroğlu. During a trilateral summit with Cyprus in Cairo, Egypt and Greece expressed their disapproval of the Turkish moves. They also outlined plans for energy cooperation in the eastern Mediterranean. Ankara responded by stating that the Turkish Navy would apply the rules of engagement should it encounter any warship in the region.
In 2015, the Zohr Field was discovered by Eni in the Egyptian EEZ, setting off a gas exploration race in the eastern Mediterranean. Zohr also revived the Cypriot gas industry's potential to be part of regional projects, such as a gas pipeline to Europe. Other initiatives include a pipeline to Egypt's decommissioned liquefaction plants and shipping the produced liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Egyptian terminals to foreign markets.

On November 16, the partnership of the Cypriot government and US company ExxonMobil successfully began carrying out hydrocarbon exploration, escorted by US Navy ships, with Turkey remaining passive. The Turkish Foreign Ministry responded with a statement in which its spokesman, Hami Aksoy, vowed that Turkey would begin drilling operations of its own in Cypriot waters. Meral Aksener, a prominent opposition leader and head of the İyi Party, addressed the Turkish parliament calling for a repeated invasion of Cyprus saying "You should know that if need be 'Ayşe will go on holiday again'", a reference to the code phrase that was used as a signal for the 1974 invasion. She additionally said that "Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish".

Alf Taeuber

Alfred Charles Taeuber (26 November 1887 – 24 February 1961) was a South Australian rower. He was a dual Australian champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight rowing crew.
Club and state rowing.
Taeuber was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They had won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and for the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Taeuber secured the five seat in the Murray Bridge eight of 1922 and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1922 and 1923.
International representative rowing.
In 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim for national Olympic selection could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Taeuber and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Taeuber in the five seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Taeuber did not row on after the Olympics.

Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" called the movie "a two-hour film packed with too much and somehow not enough, "The Last Thing He Wanted" is a thing that no one wanted."

The 1957 Boston College Eagles football team represented Boston College as an independent during the 1957 NCAA University Division football season. In its seventh season under head coach Mike Holovak, the team compiled a 7–2 record and outscored opponents by a total of 158 to 129.
Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, was built prior to the 1957 season and was dedicated with the season opener on September 27. John F. Kennedy, then a U.S. Senator, arranged for the opening match-up against Navy. The Eagles' first victory in their new stadium came the following week against Florida State.
After losing the season opener, the team won seven consecutive games before losing the final game to rival Holy Cross. The Eagles tied a school record by losing eight fumbles in the loss to Holy Cross.
The team's statistical leaders included quarterback Don Allard with 910 passing yards, fullback Alan Miller with 484 rushing yards, and end Jim Colclough with 254 receiving yards and 42 points scored. Allard, Miller, and Colclough all went on to play in the American Football League or the National Football League. Guard Tom Meehan received the Thomas F. Scanlan Memorial Trophy as the senior player outstanding in scholarship, leadership, and athletic ability.
On October 19, the team set a single-game school record in limiting Villanova to 76 yards of total offense. That total remains tied for the fourth best single-game performance in school history.

I See Red (EP)

I See Red is the debut extended play by indie band Uh Huh Her. I See Red was released on July 24. 2007, on Plaid Records.
Background.
Leisha Hailey, having been absent from the music industry since the dissolution of her former band The Murmurs, ran into Camila Grey, who was a member of Mellowdrone, at a paintball game in 2006 and had decided to form a band Alicia Warrington had originally been the third member but left the group early on.
Two tracks on I See Red were later re-released on their debut album Common Reaction, "Say So," first recorded with Hailey as the lead vocalist and the only recording with Alicia Warrington, and Explode.
Critical reception.
In a mixed review, Popmatters states "...The bright and sunny electropop on their debut EP I See Red reminds of Kosheen, though it’s not as radio-single-ready... single “Say So”, here in two versions, doesn’t show the group’s full potential, though: catchy enough for a TV theme or commercial, it’s lacking the irresistible hook of a chorus that would make the group a household name..."

Kiran Leonard

Kiran Leonard (born John Kiran Leonard) is a musician, composer and singer-songwriter from Saddleworth, Greater Manchester.
Career.
Leonard was born into a musical family in the countryside of Greater Manchester. He first learned to play mandolin and guitar and then, inspired by his older brother's diverse music collection, began to experiment with composing electronic music.
After a period of prolifically self-releasing experimental music, Leonard's full length album "Bowler Hat Soup" was released in 2012 on Hand of Glory Records to some acclaim, receiving notable endorsement from DJ Marc Riley of BBC Radio 6 Music. His subsequent LP "Grapefruit" (2016), released on Moshi Moshi Records, likewise received critical acclaim.
Leonard's music notably references a wide variety of literature, historical figures and geographical locations: his 2017 LP "Derevaun Seraun" documented a collection of pieces commissioned by Manchester Central Library inspired by works by James Joyce, Albert Camus, Henry Miller, Clarice Lispector and Manuel Bandeira, while "Grapefruit" makes reference to Ondör Gongor, Caiaphas, the Bilderberg Group, Lagavulin and Werner Herzog, "Bowler Hat Soup" to Friedrich Nietzsche, Brunswick Street, Port Ainé and Bora Bora, "Thread Colours" (2015) to Franz Kafka and Windermere, and "Garden in Bermuda" (2016) to Annie Edson Taylor and Coyoacán. He has cited musicians such as Frank Zappa, Richard Dawson, The Mars Volta and Kate Bush as important influences on his music.
Leonard currently studies Spanish and Portuguese at Wadham College, Oxford University.

The Egyptian Royal Genealogy Project is a research project started by Egyptologist Christopher John "Chris" Bennett (1953–2014) in 2001.
History.
The internet was meant as the medium for the project, which aimed at discussing new material related to the Ptolemaic dynasty as soon as they appeared, and provide direct access to primary sources for readers, such as inscriptions or papyri. The project was first hosted on the Yahoo! GeoCities with a mirror by Tyndale House. After the closure of GeoCities it became available only at the Tyndale House, which in 2019 moved the material to a sub-website, instonebrewer.com.
Many expressed their hope that the project will find its way to print; the founder, who died in 10 January 2014, stated that although he might think of it, printing is not his aim. The project was praised and recommended by academics, and its entries were cited by many scholars in academic works.

Aja released their debut EP, "In My Feelings," in 2018, followed by their debut studio album, "BOX Office", in February 2019. Their second EP, "ALL CAPS", was released in June 2019. They released "Nail in the Coffin", a Halloween-themed EP, in collaboration with Shilow later that year. They currently host the web series "Ayo Sis" on WOW Presents Plus.
Early life.
Aja was born on January 4, 1994, in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. They were raised by adoptive parents. They used to suffer from PTSD and anxiety, attributing them to a "broken family" situation, but stopped having panic attacks after starting drag. They lived as a trans woman for a year at age 18, later coming to identify as genderqueer after learning about non-binary gender identities. Aja identifies as a person of color. In 2018, they stated on Twitter that they are of Moroccan, Egyptian and Libyan descent. Later, in a 2019 Tweet, they stated that they are not of Libyan descent.
Career.

They were announced as one of 14 contestants for the ninth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race" on February 2, 2017. Aja placed ninth that season and subsequently returned to participate in the third season of "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars". Aja was eliminated during the fifth episode of "All Stars 3", but they returned in the following episode to compete for a chance to win re-entry to the competition. Another contestant, Morgan McMichaels, rejoined instead, which placed Aja seventh overall.
The drag house Haus of Aja, based in Bedford–Stuyvesant, includes members Aja, Kandy Muse, Momo Shade, Dahlia Sin, and Janelle No5. They perform at Hardware Bar.
Aja appeared in a commercial for H&amp;M's Pride OUT Loud campaign in May 2018. Since June 2018, Aja has hosted a talk show called "Ayo Sis" on WOW Presents Plus. In May 2019, Aja was sponsored by Starbucks to promote the company's S'Mores Life contest.
In July 2018, Aja announced that they no longer wish to be known as a drag queen but rather as a queer artist, stating to "them." magazine: 
For the next three years, Aja focused primarily on their musical career. In September 2021, they stated that they would again begin performing in drag. After seeing Kylie Sonique Love win the sixth season of "RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars", Aja said: "It really hit me at that moment that trans is who I am and drag is what I do... that me doing drag has never taken away from who I am as a person... As of today I can feel comfortable to say that I am a drag artist again."
Music.
Aja released the single "Level Ya Pussy Up" with producers WNNR and DJ Accident Report in February 2017.

Product of exponentials formula

The product of exponentials (POE) method is a robotics convention for mapping the links of a spatial kinematic chain. It is an alternative to Denavit–Hartenberg parameterization. While the latter method uses the minimal number of parameters to represent joint motions, the former method has a number of advantages: uniform treatment of prismatic and revolute joints, definition of only two reference frames, and an easy geometric interpretation from the use of screw axes for each joint.
The POE method was introduced by Roger W. Brockett in 1984.
Method.
The following method is used to determine the product of exponentials for a kinematic chain, with the goal of parameterizing an affine transformation matrix between the base and tool frames in terms of the joint angles formula_1
Define "zero configuration".
The first step is to select a "zero configuration" where all the joint angles are defined as being zero. The 4x4 matrix formula_2 describes the transformation from the base frame to the tool frame in this configuration. It is an affine transform consisting of the 3x3 rotation matrix "R" and the 1x3 translation vector "p". The matrix is augmented to create a 4x4 square matrix.
formula_3
Calculate matrix exponential for each joint.
The following steps should be followed for each of "N" joints to produce an affine transform for each.
Define the origin and axis of action.
For each joint of the kinematic chain, an origin point "q" and an axis of action are selected for the zero configuration, using the coordinate frame of the base. In the case of a prismatic joint, the axis of action "v" is the vector along which the joint extends; in the case of a revolute joint, the axis of action "ω" the vector normal to the rotation.
Find twist for each joint.
A 1x6 twist vector is composed to describe the movement of each joint. 
For a revolute joint,formula_4
For a prismatic joint,formula_5
The resulting twist has two 1x3 vector components: Linear motion along an axis (formula_6) and rotational motion along the same axis ("ω").formula_7
Calculate rotation matrix.
The 3x1 vector "ω" is rewritten in cross product matrix notation: formula_8
Per Rodrigues' rotation formula, the rotation matrix is calculated from the rotational component:formula_9
Calculate translation.
The 3x1 translation vector is calculated from the components of the twist.formula_10where "I" is the 3x3 identity matrix.
Compose matrix exponential.
For each joint "i", the matrix exponential formula_11 for a given joint angle formula_12 is composed from the rotation matrix and translation vector, combined into an augmented 4x4 matrix:formula_13
Compose structure equation.
The matrix exponentials are multiplied to produce a 4 × 4 affine transform formula_14 from the base frame to the tool frame in a given configuration.formula_15
Application to kinematics.
Forward kinematics may be computed directly from the POE chain for a given manipulator. This allows generating of complex trajectories of the end-effector in Cartesian space (Cartesian coordinate system) given trajectories in the joint space. Inverse kinematics for most common robot manipulators can be solved with the use of Paden–Kahan subproblems. The problem of Inverse kinematics can also be approached with the use of nonlinear root-finding methods, such as the Newton-Raphson iterative method (Newton's method).
Relationship to Denavit–Hartenberg parameters.
Advantages.
The product of exponentials method uses only two frames of reference: the base frame "S" and the tool frame "T". Constructing the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters for a robot requires the careful selection of tool frames in order to enable particular cancellations, such that the twists can be represented by four parameters instead of six. In the product of exponentials method, the joint twists can be constructed directly without considering adjacent joints in the chain. This makes the joint twists easier to construct, and easier to process by computer. In addition, revolute and prismatic joints are treated uniformly in the POE method, while they are treated separately when using the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters. Moreover, there are multiple conventions for assigning link frames when using the Denavit–Hartenberg parameters.
Conversion.
There is not a one-to-one mapping between twist coordinate mapping in both methods, but algorithmic mapping from POE to Denavit–Hartenberg has been demonstrated.
Application to parallel robots.
When analyzing parallel robots, the kinematic chain of each leg is analyzed individually and the tool frames are set equal to one another. This method is extensible to grasp analyses.

Edwin A. Keeble

Edwin Augustus Keeble (August 18, 1905 September 22, 1979) was an American architect who was trained in the Beaux-Arts architecture tradition. He designed many buildings in Tennessee, including homes, churches, military installations, skyscrapers, hospitals and school buildings, some of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. He is best known for Nashville's landmark Life and Casualty Tower built in 1957 which was the tallest commercial structure in the Southeastern United States at that time (31 stories). It reflected an architectural turn to modernism and was one of the first buildings emphasizing energy efficiency.
Keeble had a preference for designing tall slender church steeples, nicknamed "Keeble's needles" by architecture critics.
He briefly taught architecture at the University of Pennsylvania before settling in Nashville. He was one of the founders of the "Nashville Architectural Studio" during the 1920s and 1930s. His efforts to establish a school of architecture at Vanderbilt University were unsuccessful.
Early life.
Edwin A. Keeble was born August 18, 1905, in Monteagle, Tennessee, a town on the Cumberland Plateau in the southeast corner of Tennessee on a direct path between Nashville and Chattanooga. Monteagle was the family's summer home, the primary home being Nashville. He was the fourth of six children. His father, John Bell Keeble, was the dean of the Vanderbilt University Law School. His mother was Emmie Frazer. His maternal great-grandfather, John Bell, was a U.S.senator and was U.S. Secretary of War in 1841 under President William Henry Harrison. Bell was an 1860 U.S. Presidential candidate. Keeble's paternal grandfather, Edwin Augustus Keeble, was Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, Mayor of Murfreesboro, and represented Tennessee in the Confederate Congress of 1864.
Keeble grew up in his father's house at 2114 West End Avenue in Nashville, across the street from the Vanderbilt University Campus— within sight of Kissam Hall. His early schooling was at the Wallace University School, which was a block from his house. His high school was Montgomery Bell Academy, where his father had attended; it was a straight three-mile trolley ride down West End Avenue. He graduated in 1921 and went on to Vanderbilt University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering in 1924. He studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania with Paul Philippe Cret, a Frenchman who had trained in Lyon and Paris in the Beaux-Arts tradition. This association influenced Keeble to spend the summer of 1926 studying in France at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes Artistiques at Fontainebleau. The next year he studied with Georges Gromort at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He then traveled through France and Italy observing architectural styles before returning to the University of Pennsylvania to complete his architecture degree in 1928.
Early career.
On completion of his studies, Keeble returned to Nashville and for a brief period, worked for architect Donald Southgate and for a Los Angeles architect named Kenneth McDonald Jr. In 1929 he joined Francis Bodie Warfield, forming the firm of Warfield &amp; Keeble, with whom he practiced for the next 15 years . Warfield, known as "Dolly", graduated from Vanderbilt in 1915. He was about 14 years older than Keeble, and had served during the First World War in France with the 105th Engineers Corps. Warfield was primarily an engineer, and his major solo works were two housing projects, Cheatham Place and the Andrew Jackson; Vanderbilt University's Rand Hall (1952), the First Presbyterian Church, and the Springfield Woolen Mills. With Keeble, they designed McTyeire Hall in 1940 (Vanderbilt's first women's residence hall on campus) and Westminster Presbyterian Church. Warfield was a commissioner and Vice-Mayor of Belle Meade but had to resign in 1957 for health reasons before finishing his term. In 1964, Warfield was honored with a citation by the American Institute of Architects for his efforts "...to establish architecture as a significant art form".
Throughout the 1930s, their firm was quite active and they designed college dormitories, schools, churches and many private homes. When World War II was raging in Europe, Congress authorized the president to federalize the National Guard; as a result, National Guard Armories were needed on a grand scale. Warfield and Keeble received a commission from the State of Tennessee, with partial funding from the Works Progress Administration, to design and supervise the construction of National Guard Armories (see photo) in six Tennessee cities: Columbia, Lawrenceburg, Cookeville, Shelbyville, Centerville and Murfreesboro. Each armory took a year or two to build and kept them busy up until the U.S. entry into the war.
Warfield and Keeble also designed houses like the P. D. Houston Jr. House in Forest Hills in 1941, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places; but with the advent of the war, Keeble entered the military in 1944, at age 39, and this effectively dissolved their association. Stationed in Washington, D.C., Keeble served as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. He was assigned to the "Bureau of Ordnance" where he worked in the planning of rocket-producing plants, for which there existed no industrial precedent. The expertise developed during this led him many contracts for these facilities.
Post-war career.
Private homes.
After the war, in 1946, Keeble opened his solo practice, Edwin A. Keeble &amp; Associates. He designed private residences and several are on the National Register of Historic Places. Examples are the Dr. Cleo Miller House at 1431 Shelton Avenue in Nashville, and the 4410 Truxton Place house in Belle Meade. The latter house was designed in the 1960s for Keeble's nephew, Sydney Keeble and is the "French Regency" style. According to the "Nashville Post", the description, "It's a Keeble" is used as a symbol of added desirability in describing upscale Nashville homes. Keeble was quite busy during his prime years, with up to 100 projects per year. He designed seven houses, including his own, on Nashville's Stanford Drive, and the enclave was unofficially called "Keeble Heights". Here are selected examples of his private homes, all designed by Keeble unless otherwise noted; not intended to be complete:
Churches.
Keeble designed churches in Nashville and elsewhere. Some include:
Life and Casualty tower.
 Keeble designed the Life &amp; Casualty Tower, a skyscraper in downtown Nashville completed in 1957. Architecture critics called it "Nashville's first landmark" and said, "it was clearly the pivotal building on which the course of Nashville's architecture turned finally to modernism." "USA Today" (with input from the American Institute of Architects) named it as one of "The 25 must-see buildings in Tennessee" in 2017.
At the time it was built, it was the tallest commercial structure in the Southeast. Writing in "The Tennessean", Keeble described his thinking in designing the 31 story tower and said, "...every line in the Life and Casualty tower has a reason". His mission, as he described it, was to build a 409-foot tower providing light and a view; that only required one fourth of the present property area; with enough office space to meet the company's need for 25 years. His use of four-foot aluminum "fins" running up the side of the building (see photo) was designed to afford views but protect offices from the direct sun. In his planning, he consulted a Vanderbilt astronomer to map the site's exposure to the sun's rays. Keeble's intent was to maximize available sunlight in the building in winter; in summer, direct sun did not enter after 9:30 a.m. or before 5:15 p.m. Now called "passive solar architecture", this resulted in significant energy savings for the Life and Casualty owners two decades before energy conservation in buildings became a national concern. He said the aesthetic appeal of the fins is as "entirely incidental as it is welcome". He wanted to use even more aluminum in the structure, but limestone was needed for weight against wind pressure, and was less expensive.
The top 20 floors were designed to be free of internal columns, another first for a building of this height. This required more steel and therefore higher cost, but created an additional 4000 square feet and more flexibility of arrangement without columns in the way. The building cost about six million dollars.
Other designs.
He designed buildings on the campus of his alma mater Vanderbilt University, like McTyeire Hall and Memorial Gymnasium. On the campus of , Keeble designed McCready Hall, Hamilton Hall, and Cravens Hall. He was also the architect behind the Franklin County Airport in Sewanee. Outside Tennessee, Keeble designed the Milliken Building in Bowling Green, Kentucky, completed in 1963; it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Keeble designed the Veterans Administration hospitals in Nashville and Washington, D.C.
In 1970 Keeble retired, transferring his firm and its management to his long-time associates: Arnold Nye, William Lincoln, Louis C. Daugherty, Henry C. Waechter, and John F. Caldwell Jr. The new firm was named "Architect-Engineer Associates, Inc." Keeble remained a consultant.
Works include: (Keeble unless otherwise noted):
Educational pursuits.
Keeble briefly taught architecture at the University of Pennsylvania but when he moved to Nashville, he had a desire to raise the entire profile of architecture there. Early in his career, he felt that a prestigious school of architecture could be founded at Vanderbilt University; writing in a 1932 letter, he said "If we would realize our own strength and the possibilities of it, Southern architecture would follow Southern literature". Many young people who wished to study architecture came to him during the 1920s and 1930s. Rather than set them up in his office as apprentices, he did what his teacher Paul Cret had done and organized the "Nashville Architectural Studio". Working without pay, Keeble involved other architects in the teaching project including Edward E. Dougherty, Granbery Jackson Jr. and Henry C. Hibbs. Through Keeble's efforts, this group became associated with the Beaux-Arts Institute of Design in New York and was recognized as the institute's "Nashville Atelier". This meant that its students were able to transfer credits to almost any school of architecture in the United States. They met from 1930 to 1932 in a room provided by Vanderbilt University. Vanderbilt would not commit to the project to establish a school of architecture— a decision which, says Architecture historian Christine Kreyling, "still inhibits the seriousness with which the design of the built environment is taken in the city".
Personal life.
Keeble married Barbara McKelvey from Youngstown, Ohio, a graduate of Smith College, in 1936. She was studying music at Ward-Belmont in Nashville. They had a daughter, Kezia and a son, Edwin A. Keeble Jr. The junior Keeble, a Marine, was killed in the Vietnam War when his helicopter was shot down by enemy ground fire February 28, 1969. He had attended Deerfield Academy and had graduated from Princeton a couple of years prior. The daughter, Kezia Keeble was one of "Vogue Magazine's" youngest editors at age 24 and a founder of A New York public relations and advertising firm, Keeble, Cavaco, and Duka. The "New York Times" called Keeble "a shaper of American Fashion". She died of breast cancer at age 48.
Keeble married Alice Beasley on December 15, 1950 in LaGrange, Tennessee. They resided in a home he designed in the Classical Revival architectural style on Stanford Drive in Forest Hills, a suburb of Nashville. They had a son, Peter and a daughter, Lucy Keeble Wilkinson.
Edwin Keeble died on September 22, 1979 in Sewanee, Tennessee at the age of 74. His funeral was held in the Warren Chapel (which Keeble designed) located at the Monteagle Sunday School Assembly in Monteagle, Tennessee, and he was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.
Keeble's business associate in the 1930s, Francis B. Warfield died August 6, 1975 at age 84.

Paden–Kahan subproblems

Paden–Kahan subproblems are a set of solved geometric problems which occur frequently in inverse kinematics of common robotic manipulators. Although the set of problems is not exhaustive, it may be used to simplify inverse kinematic analysis for many industrial robots.
Simplification strategies.
For a structure equation defined by the product of exponentials method, Paden–Kahan subproblems may be used to simplify and solve the inverse kinematics problem. Notably, the matrix exponentials are non-commutative.
Generally, subproblems are applied to solve for particular points in the inverse kinematics problem (e.g., the intersection of joint axes) in order to solve for joint angles.
Eliminating revolute joints.
Simplification is accomplished by the principle that a rotation has no effect on a point lying on its axis. For example, if the point formula_1 is on the axis of a revolute twist formula_2, its position is unaffected by the actuation of the twist. To wit:formula_3
Thus, for a structure equationformula_4where formula_5, formula_6 and formula_7 are all zero-pitch twists, applying both sides of the equation to a point formula_1 which is on the axis of formula_7 (but not on the axes of formula_5 or formula_6) yieldsformula_12By the cancellation of formula_7, this yieldsformula_14which, if formula_5 and formula_6 intersect, may be solved by Subproblem 2.
Norm.
In some cases, the problem may also be simplified by subtracting a point from both sides of the equation and taking the norm of the result.
For example, to solveformula_4for formula_7, where formula_5 and formula_6 intersect at the point formula_21, both sides of the equation may be applied to a point formula_1 that is not on the axis of formula_7. Subtracting formula_21 and taking the norm of both sides yieldsformula_25 
This may be solved using Subproblem 3.
List of subproblems.
Each subproblem is presented as an algorithm based on a geometric proof. Code to solve a given subproblem, which should be written to account for cases with multiple solutions or no solution, may be integrated into inverse kinematics algorithms for a wide range of robots.
Subproblem 1: Rotation about a single axis.
In this subproblem, a point formula_1 is rotated around a given axis formula_2 such that it coincides with a second point formula_21.
Solution.
Let formula_33 be a point on the axis of formula_2. Define the vectors formula_35 and formula_36. Since formula_33 is on the axis of formula_2, formula_39 Therefore, formula_40
Next, the vectors formula_41 and formula_42 are defined to be the projections of formula_43 and formula_44 onto the plane perpendicular to the axis of formula_2. For a vector formula_46 in the direction of the axis of formula_2,formula_48andformula_49In the event that formula_50, formula_51 and both points lie on the axis of rotation. The subproblem therefore yields an infinite number of possible solutions in that case.
In order for the problem to have a solution, it is necessary that the projections of formula_43 and formula_44 onto the formula_54 axis and onto the plane perpendicular to formula_54 have equal lengths. It is necessary to check, to wit, that:formula_56and thatformula_57
If these equations are satisfied, the value of the joint angle formula_28 may be found using the atan2 function:formula_59Provided that formula_60, this subproblem should yield one solution for formula_28.
Subproblem 2: Rotation about two subsequent axes.
This problem corresponds to rotating formula_1 around the axis of formula_6 by formula_66, then rotating it around the axis of formula_5 by formula_65, so that the final location of formula_1 is coincident with formula_21. (If the axes of formula_5 and formula_6 are coincident, then this problem reduces to Subproblem 1, admitting all solutions such that formula_77.)
Solution.
Provided that the two axes are not parallel (i.e., formula_78), let formula_79 be a point such that formula_80 In other words, formula_79 represents the point to which formula_1 is rotated around one axis before it is rotated around the other axis to be coincident with formula_21. Each individual rotation is equivalent to Subproblem 1, but it’s necessary to identify one or more valid solutions for formula_79 in order to solve for the rotations.
Let formula_33 be the point of intersection of the two axes:formula_86Define the vectors formula_35, formula_36 and formula_89. Therefore,formula_90
This implies that formula_91, formula_92, and formula_93. Since formula_94, formula_95 and formula_96 are linearly independent, formula_97 can be written asformula_98
The values of the coefficients may be solved thus:formula_99formula_100, andformula_101The subproblem yields two solutions in the event that the circles intersect at two points; one solution if the circles are tangential; and no solution if the circles fail to intersect.
Subproblem 3: Rotation to a given distance.
In this problem, a point formula_1 is rotated about an axis formula_2 until the point is a distance formula_104 from a point formula_21. In order for a solution to exist, the circle defined by rotating formula_1 around formula_2 must intersect a sphere of radius formula_104 centered at formula_21.
Solution.
Let formula_33 be a point on the axis of formula_2. The vectors formula_35 and formula_36 are defined so thatformula_119
The projections of formula_43 and formula_44 are formula_122 and formula_123 The “projection” of the line segment defined by formula_104 is found by subtracting the component of formula_125 in the formula_54 direction:formula_127The angle formula_128 between the vectors formula_41 and formula_42 is found using the atan2 function:formula_131The joint angle formula_28 is found by the formulaformula_133This subproblem may yield zero, one, or two solutions, depending on the number of points at which the circle of radius formula_134 intersects the circle of radius formula_135.
Subproblem 4: Rotation about two axes to a given distance.
This problem is analogous to Subproblem 2, except that the final point is constrained by distances to two known points.

Mary Lorillard Barbey

Mary Lorillard Barbey (April 17, 1841 – April 10, 1926) was a prominent American member of New York Society during the Gilded Age. She was a daughter of Pierre Lorillard III of the Lorillard Tobacco Company.
Early life.
Mary Lorillard was born on April 17, 1841. She was the daughter of Pierre Lorillard III (1796–1867) and Catherine Anne (née Griswold) Lorillard (1809–1856). Her siblings included Pierre Lorillard IV; Catherine Lorillard, who married James Powell Kernochan; Jacob Lorillard; George Lyndes Lorillard, who married Marie Louise La Farge, the daughter of John La Farge and the sister of Christopher Grant La Farge, who later became the Countess de Agreda after she married Count de Agreda; Louis Lasher Lorillard, who married Katherine Livingston Beeckman, sister of Governor Robert Livingston Beeckman; and Eva Lorillard, who married Lawrence Kip.
Her paternal grandparents were Pierre Lorillard II, a prominent tobacco manufacturer and real estate tycoon for whom the term "millionaire" was first used, and Maria Dorothea (née Schultz) Lorillard. His mother's family owned "the great New York mercantile house of N. L. &amp; G. Griswold, known to their rivals as "No Loss and Great Gain Griswold," importers of rum, sugar, and tea."
Society life.
Mrs. Barbey and her daughter Eva were included in the infamous "Four Hundred" of New York Society, as dictated by Mrs. Astor and Ward McAllister and published in "The New York Times" on February 16, 1892. The number 400 was reportedly the number of people who would fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom.
Barbey and her husband were members of the Tuxedo Club and built one of the earliest residences in Tuxedo Park, New York, which was founded by her family. She was also a member of the Colonial Dames of America. In summer, the Barbeys were residents of Bellevue on Lake Geneva in Switzerland, where her husband was born in 1832. Her husband was a founding member, and a member of the vestry for 31 years, of Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also known as "The American Church," in Geneva. He donated the land for the construction of the church building, and partially financed its construction and running during the early years.
Personal life.
On January 12, 1865, she was married to Henry Isaac Barbey (1832–1906). He was a son of Henry Barbey and Marie Helen Iselin. Through his mother, he was a nephew of Adrian Georg Iselin and cousin of Charles Oliver Iselin. Barbey was a financier and a director of the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway. They lived at 17 West 38th Street in New York City. Together, they were the parents of:
Her husband died at their home in Bellevue on July 9, 1906. His estate was valued at $6,581,051 at the time of his death, which she inherited. Barbey moved to Paris, France living at 45 Avenue l'Alma, where she died on April 10, 1926. She was buried in Genthod or Bellevue.
Descendants.
Through her daughter Hélène, she was the step-grandmother of Count Guy de Pourtalès (1881–1941), the author, and Count Raimond de Pourtalès (1882–1914), attache of the German embassy, who married Countess Luise Alexandra von Bernstorff (1888–1971), daughter of Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff, the German Ambassador to the United States in 1911. The wedding, which took place in Washington, D.C. was attended by William Howard Taft, who was then the President of the United States. After his death in 1914, she remarried to Prince Johannes Baptista of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg (1880-1956), the youngest son of Charles, 6th Prince of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg.
Through her daughter Baroness Andre de Neuflize, she was the grandmother of Miss Jacqueline de Neuflize, who married Baron Jean de Watteville-Berckheim of Paris.
Through her daughter Eva, she was the grandmother of Mlle Genevieve de Neuflize, who married Count Costa de Beauregard, the son of the Marquis de Beauregard, descendants of an old French family, in 1930. Upon their wedding, de Beauregard inherited Château de Beauregard, the family residence in France on the shores of Lake Geneva.

Rhodian coinage

Ancient Rhodian coinage refers to the coinage struck by an independent Rhodian polity during Classical and Hellenistic eras. The Rhodians also controlled territory on neighbouring Caria that was known as Rhodian Peraia under the islanders' rule. However, many other eastern Mediterranean states and polities adopted the Rhodian (Chian) monetary standard following Rhodes. Coinage using the standard achieved a wide circulation in the region. Even the Ptolemaic Kingdom, a major Hellenistic state in the eastern Mediterranean, briefly adopted the Rhodian monetary standard.
Rhodian monetary standard.
Rule by Athens temporarily brought Attic standard to Rhodian mints. However, after Athenian league's influence waned, Chian standard spread through the Eastern Mediterranean. It is unknown how much Rhodes made an impact on the spread of the Chian standard. Rhodes held a growing economical importance during that period which came after its unification. This weight standard was subsequently known as a Rhodian standard, thus giving a further hint on the leading role of Rhodes.
By the end of the fourth century BC the Aegean region had been dominated by coinage using Attic and Rhodian standards. Early Rhodian standard had replaced Aeginetan standard in silver coinage for most Cycladian mints by the third century BC. By Alexander the Great's time Rhodian standard was accepted by most of Ionia, Caria and by numerous states of the Cyclades and Propontis. Alexander's adoption of the Attic weight brought demise of all other weight standards except for the Attic and Rhodian standards.
Rhodian standard was later notably used in the transition to Phoenician weight by the Ptolemaic Kingdom as it abandoned the Attic weight in favor of its own monetary standard. Ptolemaic use of the Rhodian standard was restricted to an approximate period of c. 310 BC – c. 298 BC.
Early Chian, or Rhodian, standard included tetradrachms and heavier coins. However, later coinage using Rhodian weight evolved with tetradrachms being abandoned in favor of smaller didrachms. Coins lost their weight both before and after the abandonment of the tetradrachms. Early tetradrachms and didrachms were 15.6 g and 7.8 g in weight respectively. They were both replaced in use by later didrachms with the minimum weight of 6.7 g.
There is convincing evidence that Rhodian and Lycian league's plinthophoroi circulated, at least informally, at par on the market, and they have been found together in coin hoards. However, Lycian coinage's weight standard was slightly lighter than Rhodian standard.
Mints.
Rhodes itself held the most important mints. Ephesus is notable for holding the most important mint for the Rhodian monetary standard outside of the Rhodian controlled territory.
Naxos minted tetrobols (Rhodian weight drachms) while using Aeginetan standard for other coins. Ios was another island that saw limited usage of the Rhodian standard. It was primarily known for hosting the tomb of Homer. A very small series of didrachms were struck between 350 BC – 320 BC, and they included a portrait and name of Homer on observe sides of the coins.
History of Rhodian coinage.
Rhodes was a major maritime and mercantile power. For instance, Syrian goods on bound to Egypt made a detour through the island of Rhodes. Rhodians also made large contributions to fight piracy in the region. Rhodes was an ally of the Ptolemaic Kingdom.
Siege of Rhodes (305 BC – 304 BC) by Demetrius I of Macedon resulted in Rhodians gaining wider freedom of action, and ties with Ptolemaic Egypt being strengthened. The siege had been an attempt to break the Rhodo-Egyptian alliance. However, tetradrachms and golden coinage originating from Rhodes disappeared for a considerable length of time. Rhodian didrachms (weighting 6,7g) gained a solid position, with its wide circulation, in the eastern Mediterranean trade. Its atypical weight did not allow the Rhodian didrachm to function as a real international means of exchange. Many Rhodian silver coins were also melted down in Egypt when spent there, and were subsequently struck as Ptolemaic coinage.
Imitations of Rhodian coinage are proven to have circulated between 188 BC and 167 BC in Lycia on the mainland Asia Minor. These forged coins imitated an older variant of Rhodian coinage.
During 88 BC siege of Rhodes by Mithridates VI a possible emergency series of large bronze coinage was struck as a result of the war.
End of the local currency.
The final demise for the Rhodian currency was brought by the late Republican Roman civil wars beginning from the Caesar's Civil War. Many small Hellenistic silver currencies ceased to exist. By 30 BC the Roman monetary system and denarii were clearly dominant in the eastern parts of the Empire.
Rhodes came under direct Roman rule in 31 AD and was merged in the province of Asia in 44 AD.
Iconography.
Sun god Helios was the prominent deity for the Rhodians. Several ancient towns claimed descent from the deity. Helios would appear on obverse sides of Rhodian coinage for four centuries. Designs of Rhodian coinage were unaffected by the campaigns of Alexander the Great.
Rhodes used a head of Helios or a rose as their symbol. These symbols were also used in other forms of art, in addition to coinage, such as in stamps of amphorae. Local symbols can be used to determine the origin of an artifact, and in certain cases the symbol refers to the name of the place. The rose refers to Rhodes as a canting symbol (making a pun of the name). One type of Rhodian tetradrachms (see fig. 1) used a ship's prow as a symbol of Rhodian naval might. The prow is more evident from a more complete specimen of the coin, and it is on the left side of the rose which is on reverse side of the coin. On the right side of the rose is a bud. Below the rose is name of the magistrate, and a text above the rose refers to Rhodes. Obverse side of the coin portrays sun god Helios.
Rhodian silver coinage may give hints on the appearance of the Colossus of Rhodes.

His research focuses on the public economics of healthcare and child welfare. He currently serves as co-director of the MIT Sloan Initiative for Health Systems Innovation and as co-chair of the Health Sector of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL).
Biography.
Joseph Doyle earned a B.A. from Cornell University in 1996, after which he worked as an assistant economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (1996–98) while studying at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (1997–98). Thereafter, Doyle obtained a Ph.D. in economics with a focus on econometrics and the economics of the public sector from the University of Chicago in 2002. After completing his studies, he began his career at the MIT Sloan School of Management as an assistant professor (2002–05). In 2005, Doyle became the Jon D. Gruber Career Development Assistant Professor (2005–08), then associate professor (2008–09), the Alfred Henry and Jean Morrison Hayes Career Development Associate Professor (2009-2013), and has been the Erwin H. Schell Professor of Management since 2013. In parallel, Doyle has held visiting appointments at the Paris School of Economics (2010) and the European University Institute (2017-18). Doyle is co-director of the MIT Sloan Initiative for Health Systems Innovation and maintains professional affiliations with the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) as co-chair of its Health Sector, with the NBER as research associate, and with the Danish National Centre for Social Research as a research fellow. Moreover, he performs editorial duties at the "Journal of Human Resources", served as co-editor of the "Journal of Public Economics" (2012–16) and is a member of the American Economic Association as well as of the American Society of Health Economists.
Research.
Joseph Doyle's research interests include public economics, health economics, and labour economics. Key findings of his research include the following:
In particular, Doyle's research with Douglas Almond, Heidi Williams and Amanda E. Kowalski on the marginal returns of medical care for at-risk newborns was awarded the Garfield Economic Impact Award by Research!America in 2011. The study showed that medical care prescribed as a result of newborns being slightly below the critical birthweight threshold of 1,500 grams was effective in substantially decreasing the mortality of these newborns relative to newborns slightly above the threshold. The authors then use the cost of the decrease in mortality rates for these newborns to estimate the cost for saving a newborn's statistical life to be about $550,000 in 2006 US$, i.e. well below common estimates of the value of a full statistical life.

Brimmon Oak

The Brimmon Oak is a veteran tree in Newtown, Powys, Wales. An English oak, it is thought to be around 500 years old and has been on land farmed by the same family since the 1600s. The tree was scheduled to be felled as part of the construction of the A483 Newtown Bypass in 2015 but was saved as the result of a petition. The tree was named both Welsh and British Tree of the Year for 2016 and was runner up in the European Tree of the Year awards of 2017.
History.
The Brimmon Oak is an English or pedunculate oak thought to be more than 500 years old. The tree has been pollarded for timber in the past and has a girth of over . The land the tree stands on has been owned by the same family of farmers for generations – the current owner claims his family has farmed the field around the tree since the 1600s, and a 1901 photograph shows a wedding party sheltering beneath the tree's canopy. It has been described as one of the most significant natural monuments of Montgomeryshire, the historic county in which it stands.
The tree was scheduled to be felled as part of the construction of the A483 Newtown Bypass in 2015. The farmer of the land on which it stands organised a 5,000-signature petition to the Welsh Assembly calling for its preservation. This was successful and the route of the bypass was altered to protect the tree and a 15m area around it. The campaign sought further assurances from the contractors as they were concerned that the works specified within the area would damage the tree's roots. A further petition was launched in May 2018 to name the soon-to-be opened bypass as the "Newtown Brimmon Oak Bypass" in honour of the tree.
Tree of the Year awards.
In 2016 the tree won the Welsh Tree of the Year awards and in December of that year was selected by judges as the United Kingdom's tree of the year beating the winners of the national awards for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The prize was a £1,000 care grant and entry into the European Tree of the Year awards. In March 2017 it was announced that the tree had finished second in the European awards, determined by popular vote. The tree was second to the in Poland and received 16,200 votes. The result was the best placed finish for a British tree in the award's history.

Niger Air Base 201

Niger Air Base 201 (also known in some sources as "Nigerien Air Base 201") is a United States drone airbase near Agadez, Niger.
The base is about 5 km southeast of Agadez. It is owned by the Nigerien military but built and paid for by the United States. It is operated by the U.S. military as a drone base. As of February 2018, the site consists of a runway, still under construction, a hangar, and numerous smaller buildings for personnel to work and live in.
Operations.
The U.S. military presence at Base 201 began on April 19, 2016. Once complete, the runway will be big enough to accommodate both General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper armed drones as well as the much larger Boeing C-17 Globemaster III transport airplanes. Construction was scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. However, delays have pushed the completion estimate to mid-2019. Runway construction is being undertaken by the 31st Expeditionary Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers.
In May 2019 Vice News reported on activity at the base, then non-operational, amidst a wider report on the consequences of a US withdrawal from Niger. In July 2019, the 409th Air Expeditionary Group and the 411th Civil Affairs Battalion are stationed at the base.
ISR flights officially began on November 1, 2019.
Construction.
The amount of US$50 million was approved by Congress for the base, but the cost may end up exceeding $100 million. The base was originally planned to be operational by the end of 2018, but delays have caused the completion date of the base to be pushed to mid-2019. The Air Base was described by U.S. officials as the largest construction project led by the United States Air Force. A report by the Department of Defense Inspector General criticized the project for skirting congressional oversight, failing to complete an adequate site survey, and not constructing the base to meet safety, security, and other technical requirements, findings that were disputed by the Air Force and U.S. Africa Command.

Hylas and the Nymphs (painting)

Hylas and the Nymphs is an 1896 oil painting by John William Waterhouse. The painting depicts a moment from the Greek and Roman legend of the tragic youth Hylas, based on accounts by Ovid and other ancient writers, in which the enraptured Hylas is abducted by Naiads (female water nymphs) while seeking drinking water.
"Hylas and the Nymphs" is exhibited in the Manchester Art Gallery.
Background.
Myth.
Hylas was the son of King Theiodamas of the Dryopians. After Hercules killed Hylas's father, Hylas became a companion of Hercules and later his lover . They both became Argonauts, accompanying Jason in his quest on his ship "Argo" in seeking the Golden Fleece. During the journey, Hylas was sent to find fresh water. He found a pond occupied by Naiads, and they lured Hylas into the water and he disappeared.
The painting.
The painting measures . It depicts Hylas, a male youth in classical garb, wearing a blue tunic with a red sash, and bearing a wide-necked water jar. He is bending down beside a pond in a glade of lush green foliage, reaching out towards seven young women, the water nymphs, who are emerging from the pond among the leaves and flowers of Nymphaeaceae (water lilies), including an early depiction of the yellow waterlily, "Nuphar lutea". The nymphs are naked, their alabaster skin luminous in the dark but clear water, with yellow and white flowers in their auburn hair. They have very similar physical features, perhaps based on just two models.
Hylas is being enticed to enter the water, from which he will not return. One of the nymphs holds his wrist and elbow, a second plucks at his tunic, and a third holds out some pearls in the palm of her hand. The face of Hylas in profile is shadowed and barely visible, but the faces of the nymphs are clearly visible as they gaze upon him. The scene is depicted from a slightly elevated position, looking down at the water like Hylas, so no sky is visible. Hylas's position forces the viewer's focus onto the nymphs in the water and the lack of reference to his relationship with Hercules emphasizes that the narrative of the painting is not about Hylas's experiences, but about the sinister nature of the nymphs.
Some of Waterhouse's preparatory sketches are in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.
Significance.
Hylas was a recurrent theme for British artists in the 19th and early 20th centuries, with examples by William Etty (1833) and Henrietta Rae (1910), and an earlier example by Waterhouse himself (1893). Waterhouse also painted other tragic youths from Greek legend, such as Narcissus in "Echo and Narcissus" (1903) (at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool). His poem "Hercules and Hylas" was published by Francis Burdett Thomas Coutts-Nevill in 1896.
Display.
The painting "Hylas and the Nymphs" was acquired from the artist by the Manchester Art Gallery in 1896. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition in 1897.
In January 2018, Manchester Art Gallery curator Clare Gannaway temporarily removed the painting from public display, after a decision "taken by gallery staff [along] with artist Sonia Boyce." The decision, the curator stated, was "influenced by recent movements against the objectification and exploitation of women" such as the MeToo campaign and the Presidents Club controversy. She denied the removal constituted any form of censorship, stating, "we want to see this as the start of a process, not an end point," and providing visitors with Post-It notes to air their views; meantime, postcards of the painting were removed from the gift shop.
A "strong backlash" followed the decision. Art historian and author Elizabeth Prettejohn, who had previously curated a Waterhouse exhibition at the Royal Academy, disputed the claims about "public debate", stating that "taking [the painting] off display is killing any kind of debate that you might be able to have." After one week, the Manchester City Council, which runs the gallery, returned the painting to the wall. "It's been clear that many people feel very strongly about the issues raised," stated the council in the announcement.

Guilherme Karan

Guilherme Pontes Karam (born Guilherme Karam; October 8, 1957 - July 7, 2016) was a Brazilian actor.
Biography.
Son of the admiral and Minister of the Navy in the João Figueiredo government, Alfredo Karam and Lydiane Pontes Karam. Most of his work is comic, and was once a member of the Brazilian "TV Pirata" comedy show, one of the greatest hits of humor, screened by Globo TV. His most prominent work on TV is Butler Porfírio in telenovela "Meu Bem, Meu Mal".
Disease.
On April 29, 2005, he was robbed in a taxi, with his purse stolen. Karam physically suffered nothing, but the taxi driver was killed by reacting. Apparently, since the time of the assault Karam began to manifest symptoms of Machado-Joseph disease, a degenerative syndrome, also known as spinocerebellar ataxia type 3, which compromises motor coordination and control over muscles. Forced to switch to a wheelchair to get around, he has since stayed away from the stage and television. According to his father, Alfredo Karam, who gave statements to the Rio newspaper "Extra", he inherited the illness of his mother, who died due to this same genetic anomaly. The other three brothers of the actor have already presented the disease - two already died.
Death.
The actor died on July 7, 2016, at the Hospital Naval Marcílio Dias, as a result of the Machado-Joseph syndrome. His body was buried in Cemitério de São João Batista.

Jonathan Van Ness

Jonathan McDonald Van Ness (born March 28, 1987), also commonly referred to by his initials, JVN, is an American hairdresser, podcast host, activist, actor, author, and television personality. He is best known as the grooming expert on the Netflix series "Queer Eye", for his work on the web series parody "Gay of Thrones," and for hosting the "Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness" podcast"."
Early life.
Jonathan Van Ness was born March 28, 1987, and raised in Quincy, Illinois. Van Ness said he comes "from a family of journalists," being the sixth generation of their family-owned newspaper. This refers to broadcast and newspaper conglomerate Quincy Media and the company's local flagship newspaper, the "Herald-Whig"; Van Ness' mother is the vice president of Quincy Media, and he is a descendant of the Oakley family which has controlled the company since the 1890s.
Openly gay throughout his life, Van Ness experienced bullying for his "femininity and natural flamboyance," and received death threats. He "endured years of judgment, ridicule, and trauma." Of the time, Van Ness said, "Growing up I definitely put on every nail polish, every heel, every scarf – I definitely had my mom's knockoff Hermès scarves in my hair and around my waist – those were my skirts, and I loved it. ... But when I was really young, I had really femme-shamey, gender-shamey [reactions] when I would dress like that. When I would play with those things, I knew it needed to be... behind closed doors." Although always comfortable in his own skin, he says it did take some time to navigate other people's reactions. In response to the bullying he used humor as a coping mechanism, and relied on a small group of close friends for support. Years later, in the late 2010s, he realized he was gender non-conforming, and non-binary.
When he was younger, he was sexually abused by an older boy at church, and Van Ness said this laid the foundation for self-destructive behaviors. In his early teens, he used online-chat to socialize with, and sometimes meet older men for sex. He was the first male cheerleader at Quincy Senior High School and continued cheerleading in college at the University of Arizona, where he majored in political science. One month in his initial semester at college, he used up his monthly allowance on 
cocaine and, too embarrassed to ask his parents for funds, turned to sex work. His addictions to sex and drugs increased to also include methamphetamine. His grades fell and he lost his cheerleading scholarship. He dropped out after one semester to pursue hairstyling.
Van Ness trained at the Aveda Institute in Minneapolis. After graduating, he worked in Arizona for five years, before moving to Los Angeles, California, in 2009. 
Career.
In Los Angeles, Van Ness found a job as a personal assistant at Sally Hershberger Salon. One day in 2012, at age 25, he fainted in the salon while doing highlights for a client's hair. Later at a clinic, he found out he was HIV-positive. He used the revelation to "get clean" from drug use and publicly shared his story, saying, "I want people to realize you’re never too broken to be fixed." He currently works at MoJoHair and Stile Salon, both in Los Angeles, which he co-founded with Monique Northrop of Arte Salon in New York City.
Media.
In 2013, while dressing the hair of friend Erin Gibson – who worked for the comedy syndicate Funny or Die – Van Ness was asked by Gibson to perform his recap of a "Game of Thrones" episode for Funny or Die, which became the "Gay of Thrones" web series. Van Ness was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Short Form Variety Series in 2018 for "Gay of Thrones".
Since 2015, Van Ness has hosted the weekly podcast "Getting Curious with Jonathan Van Ness". His podcast took off upon the airing of the first "Queer Eye" episode.
Van Ness currently stars as the grooming expert on the Netflix revival of "Queer Eye".
Books.
Van Ness' memoir, "Over the Top: A Raw Journey to Self-Love", was published in October 2019. His memoir discusses his past and how it helped sculpt his future.
In 2020, Van Ness released a picture book titled "Peanut goes for the Gold". It tells the story of a nonbinary guinea pig named Peanut and their adventures as a rhythmic gymnastics prodigy. Peanut is inspired by Jonathan's own childhood pet. In an interview for "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon", Van Ness discussed how Peanut didn't have any other rhythmic gymnasts to look up to so they created a space for themselves as a rhythmic gymnast. He also announced "Peanut goes for the Gold" would be partnering with No Kid Hungry’s fund #savewithstories, where Van Ness did a virtual reading of "Peanut goes for the Gold" to support the children affected by the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure they have access to meals that would have been provided to them at school. In a LiveSigning interview, Van Ness explained why he wanted to write "Peanut goes for the Gold," saying “I really wanted to do something that would celebrate all those kids that are individual and themselves”, and emphasized the importance of uniqueness and pursuing one's passions.
Personal life.
Van Ness is non-binary. His pronouns are he/him/his, but he has indicated that he is okay being referred to with she/her or they/them as well. In December 2020, he revealed that he had married his partner, Mark Peacock, earlier that year.
Van Ness currently works in Los Angeles and New York City. He has psoriasis, a chronic skin condition, and advises clients on skin care. In 2019, he came out as HIV positive.
On September 25, 2019, Van Ness announced his endorsement of Elizabeth Warren for president in 2020 based upon healthcare being a human right.
On June 23, 2020, Van Ness and "Queer Eye" costar Bobby Berk praised recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions that ruled that LGBT employment discrimination was a violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Van Ness described the ruling as "a great step in the right direction." However, both of them still urged the United States Congress to pass the proposed Equality Act.

Frances Cope

Frances Cope, also known as Frances Thorndike (August 19, 1902 - May 14, 1982), was an American mathematician who published on irregular differential equations. The Thorndike nomogram, a two-dimensional diagram of the Poisson distribution, is named for her.
Education and career.
Born Elizabeth Frances Thorndike in New York City and known as Frances, her parents were Elizabeth (Moulton) Thorndike and Edward L. Thorndike, an educational psychologist who taught at Teachers College, Columbia University.
Frances was educated at Horace Mann School in New York and at Drum Hill High School in Peekskill. She graduated from Vassar College in 1922 and earned her master's degree in mathematics from Columbia University in 1925. In a 1926 paper, she first published a two-dimensional diagram of the Poisson distribution that is now named the Thorndike nomogram after her.
She worked for several years as an engineering assistant at American Telephone and Telegraph Company (1922–24, 1925–27) before becoming an instructor of physics at Vassar (1927–28). She spent the 1928–29 academic year as a fellow working towards a Ph.D. at Radcliffe College, where she met fellow mathematician Thomas Freeman Cope; they married in 1929.
In 1930, Cope and her husband moved to Ohio (where he had a job at Marietta College), and two years later she completed her doctorate at Radcliffe as a student of George David Birkhoff. The subject of her Ph.D. thesis was formal solutions of irregular differential equations, and the publications that came out of it continue to be cited in the literature of both mathematics and physics.
Cope taught mathematics as an instructor at Vassar in 1935–36. In 1937 the Copes moved to New York, where she was an instructor of math at Queens College in 1941 and Adelphi College from 1941 to 1943.

<doc id="56626456" url="?curid=56626456" title="Ghetto (Denmark)">
Ghetto (Denmark)

A particularly vulnerable public housing area () is an official term for district in Denmark which according to the government has social problems, and usually has a majority population of "non-Western" ethnicities. Such areas are often referred to in Danish as "ghettos", and an annual "ghetto list" ("ghettolisten") has been published by the Danish Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing since 2010.
Until May 2018.
At least three of the following five criteria had to be fulfilled for a district to be included on the list:
In 2017, no area fulfilled all five criteria, but four districts fulfilled four criteria: Mjølnerparken in Copenhagen, Gadehavegård in Høje-Taastrup, Vollsmose in Odense and Gellerupparken/Toveshøj in Aarhus. Prior to the May 2018 revision of the criteria, 22 districts were on the list.
May 2018 criteria.
In May 2018 the criteria were revised and districts with three out of the five criteria were placed on the list. That changed the number of ghetto districts from 22 to 30.
Severe ghettos.
A district that remains four years in a row on the list is then classified to be a severe ghetto (Danish: "hård ghetto"). In May 2018 there were 16 severe ghettoes. Individuals receiving social welfare such as social benefits, education aid or integration aid are not allowed to settle in severe ghettoes.
Government response.
In March 2018, the government of Denmark presented an action plan with 22 proposals where the Denmark would be rid of the ghettoes by 2030. Among the suggestions were funds of 12 billion DKK to have some districts demolished and others redeveloped. Regulations would change to facilitate evictions of criminals from their housing in the ghettoes. The plan was accepted by the Danish parliament in May 2018. On the same occasion, the criteria for list inclusion were changed.
Before children in ghettoes start school, they will undergo a Danish language test and be offered language training before the school starts.
Public housing.
The share of public housing in ghetto areas would be reduced to a maximum of 40% in districts that had been on the ghetto list for 4 consecutive years. Consequently, 9 buildings with 600 apartments in the Gellerup district and 3 buildings with 318 in the Bispehaven district of Aarhus are to be demolished, displacing 1,000 families. In their stead, 2000 homes for ownership and 657 business properties are planned to be built.
All meetings of housing associations are to be held in Danish, even if some housing association board members do not speak the language.
Moving restrictions.
Convicted criminals and people on public welfare would face restrictions on moving to areas on the list.
Name change.
In June 2019 a new social democratic government was formed in Denmark, with Kaare Dybvad becoming housing minister. Dybvad said that official use of the word "ghetto" in reference to marginalized areas is "derogatory", and he wanted to put an end to political use of the word in order to avoid stigmatizing the areas.

Ella Frances Braman

Ella Frances Braman (March 23, 1850 – ?) was an American lawyer and business woman. She trained as a lawyer assisting her husband that she was recognised as a commissioner for different states so that she could deputise for her husband. After they moved to New York City, she became her husband's business partner. She held commissions from Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and William Henry Harrison, as well as Governors of principal States and Territories, including Alaska and Puerto Rico. She was a notary public and commissioner of deeds for the District of Columbia, United States Court of Claims and a commissioner of deeds for New York City, as well as a passport, consular, and naturalization agent.
Early years.
Ella Frances Collins and her twin, Edgar Frances, were born in Brighton, Boston, Massachusetts, March 23, 1850, to Abram Wing Collins and Sophronia Swift (Ellis) Collins. She was of Puritans ancestry. Her other siblings included Bathsheba Ellia, Elizabeth Burgess, Abram Wing Collins, Jr., Betsie Howes Doane, Adela Rebecca Collins, Williams Ellis Collins, Harriet Ferdinand Nye Collins, Mary Gleason Collins, and Fred Swift Collins.
Career.
On September 10, 1867, she married Joseph Balch Braman, of Brighton, then a member of the Boston Bar. Their children were Susan Caroline (b. 1870), Joseph Chandler (b. 1872): Ella Angela (b. 1874); and Joseph Herbert (b. 1875).
In 1872, they went to Los Angeles, California, where her husband practiced law until the spring of 1874, when he resumed law practice in Boston. Soon after their return to Boston, Mr. Braman required someone to assist him in his Boston office as commissioner for the different states to which he had just been appointed, and Mrs. Braman volunteered to become his assistant. She proved so competent that it was decided to ask for her appointment also, so that she could act, especially when clients called for a commissioner during Mr. Braman's temporary absence from the office. Each State governor was written to. Governor John Davis Long adding his endorsement, but only ten governors could then be found who either believed in a woman's being appointed or thought they had the power to grant the commission to a woman. Soon Mr. and Mrs. Braman removed to New York City to practice, and then it was determined to continue asking for the appointments from the governors until she had them all. By 1893, she lacked only about eight States. President William Henry Harrison gave her the commissions.
Soon after settling in the metropolis, she became a regular partner with her husband. They had a downtown day office in the Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, and an uptown office and residence at 1270 Broadway. Mrs. Braman was a lawyer, notary public, a commissioner of deeds for the States, Territories and District of Columbia, the United States Court of Claims, a United States passport agent at New York, and a consular agent. She held about fifty commissions and appointments from the President of the United States and from governors of States. Mrs Braman's uptown office was in her residence, and it was never closed. Her theory seemed to be that a person who carries on business should always be ready to attend to business, and to that end, her office was kept open, night and day, every day in the year, making no exception even for Sundays and holidays. Here, she kept the laws, blanks and forms for all the States.
Mecca Temple Shrine conferred upon her its ladies' degree; she was a member of Alpha Chapter No. 1, Order of the Eastern Star.

Yu Xi

Yu Xi (虞喜; 307–345 AD), courtesy name Zhongning (仲寧), was a Chinese astronomer and writer of the Jin dynasty (266–420 AD). He is best known for his discovery of the precession of the equinoxes, independently of the earlier ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus. He also postulated that the Earth could be spherical in shape instead of being flat and square, long before the idea became widely accepted in Chinese science with the advances in circumnavigation by Europeans from the 16th-20th centuries, especially with their arrival into the capital's imperial court in the 17th century.
Background and official career.
The life and works of Yu Xi are described in his biography found in the "Book of Jin", the official history of the Jin dynasty. He was born in Yuyao, Guiji (modern Shaoxing, Zhejiang province, China). His father Yu Cha (虞察) was a military commander and his younger brother Yu Yu (虞預; fl. 307–329 AD) was likewise a scholar and writer. During the reign of Emperor Min of Jin (r. 313–317 AD) he obtained a low-level position in the administration of the governor of Guiji commandery. He declined a series of nominations and promotions thereafter, including a teaching position at the imperial university in 325 AD, an appointment at the imperial court in 333 AD, and the post of cavalier attendant-in-ordinary in 335 AD.
Works.
In 336 AD Yu Xi wrote the "An Tian Lun" (安天論; "Discussion of Whether the Heavens Are At Rest" or "Disquisition on the Conformation of the Heavens"). In it he described the precession of the equinoxes (i.e. axial precession). He observed that the position of the sun during the winter solstice had drifted roughly one degree over the course of fifty years relative to the position of the stars. This was the same discovery made earlier by the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus (c. 190–120 BC), who found that the measurements for either the sun's path around the ecliptic to the vernal equinox or the sun's relative position to the stars were not equal in length.
Yu Xi wrote a critical analysis of the "huntian" (渾天) theory of the celestial sphere, arguing that the heavens surrounding the earth were infinite and motionless. He advanced the idea that the shape of the earth was either square or round, but that it had to correspond to the shape of the heavens enveloping it. The "huntian" theory, as mentioned by Western Han dynasty astronomer Luoxia Hong (fl. 140–104 BC) and fully described by the Eastern Han dynasty polymath scientist and statesman Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), insisted that the heavens were spherical and that the earth was like an egg yolk at its center. Yu Xi's ideas about the infinity of outer space seem to echo Zhang's ideas of endless space even beyond the celestial sphere. Although mainstream Chinese science before European influence in the 17th century surmised that the Earth was flat and square-shaped, some scholars, such as Song dynasty mathematician Li Ye (1192–1279 AD), proposed the idea that it was spherical like the heavens. The acceptance of a spherical earth can be seen in the astronomical and geographical treatise "Gezhicao" (格致草) written in 1648 by Xiong Mingyu (熊明遇). It rejects the square-earth theory and, with clear European influence, explains that ships are capable of circumnavigating the globe. However, it explained this using classical Chinese phrases, such as the earth being as round as a crossbow bullet, a phrase Zhang Heng had previously used to describe the shape of both the sun and moon. Ultimately, though, it was the European Jesuits in China of the 17th century that dispelled the Chinese theory of a flat earth, convincing the Chinese to adopt the spherical earth theory established by the ancient Greeks Anaxagoras (c. 500–428 BC), Philolaus (c. 470–385), Aristotle (384–322 BC), and Eratosthenes (c. 276–195 BC). 
Yu Xi is known to have written commentaries on the various Chinese classics. His commentaries and notes were mostly lost before the Tang dynasty, but the fragments preserved in other texts were collected in a single compendium by Qing-dynasty scholar Ma Guohan (1794–1857).

Zinc Finger Protein 800

Zinc Finger Protein 800 or ZNF800 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "ZNF800" gene. The specific function of ZNF800 is not yet well understood by the scientific community.
Gene.
The ZNF800 gene is between 127373344bp and 127391557bp on the reverse strand of Chromosome 7, locus 7q31.33, spanning a total of 18214 base pairs. It has a predicted molecular weight of 75,235.79 g/mol and a predicted isoelectric point of 9.54. The gene codes for 7 exons and is translated into 664 amino acids. Only 4 exons are in the coding region of the gene and make up the ZNF800 protein, but there is a total of 6. Another name for ZNF800 is PP902. ZNF800 contains 6 functioning C2H2 zinc finger protein domains, a number of SNP's, and multiple experimentally-shown phosphorylation and SUMOylation sites.
Neighborhood.
ZNF800 is in the neighborhood of PAX4, which plays an important role in the differentiation and development of pancreatic islet beta cells.
Zinc finger protein family.
ZNF800 is part of a large zinc finger protein family, and several other members of this family have previously been described. Zinc finger proteins have both DNA binding and metal (zinc) binding properties. They are found in the cell nucleus. When compared to other members of the zinc finger protein family, ZNF800 has only 48-34% similarity to its closest zinc finger protein relatives. However, several zinc finger regions and possible nucleotide binding sites are conserved.
Transcript.
The protein is made in small amounts, potentially due to the unfavorability of its Kozak sequence as compared to that of more favorable proteins.
Protein.
ZNF800 is ubiquitously expressed in at least 27 different tissues, with the largest amounts in bone marrow, testis, and lymph nodes. The ZNF800 protein contains 6 C2H2 zinc finger regions, 4 of which are conserved in paralogs, and 5 of which are conserved in orthologs of ZNF800. It also has two larger regions of unknown function, which are conserved in orthologs, and several key amino acids, the function of which in this particular protein has not yet been discovered.
Gene level regulation.
The promoter for ZNF800 was predicted to be between 127391456 bp and 127393803bp, spanning 2348 base pairs. This is located directly before the gene sequence. Several transcription factor binding sites were identified in this area. ZNF800 is expressed ubiquitously throughout the body at low levels. There does seem to be increased expression in the blood and thymus, but the evidence for this is somewhat contradictory. NCBI GEO Profiles across all tissues revealed the following expression levels in tissues throughout the body: highest expression of ZNF800 in bone marrow, liver, spleen and thymus. In situ hybritization data of ZNF800 in the mouse brain from Allen Brain Atlas showed ubiquitous expression of ZNF800 in the brain in low levels (Figure: "Mouse Brain ZNF800 Expression").
Transcript level regulation.
Looking at the intron sequences next to the beginning and end of each exon and comparing those to favorable ones, it was found that all of the splice regions on ZNF800 are favorable. This explains why there are no shorter ZNF800 isoforms.
Protein level regulation.
Several different tools were used on ExPASy Proteomics to analyze ZNF800 for likely protein modification sites, unique composition, and localization. The composition of human ZNF800 was compared to that of the Mummichog ZNF800, which has a 46% identity to the human ZNF800. Several different programs showed that ZNF800 is likely localized to the nucleus and does not contain any trans-membrane domains. Human ZNF800 is rich in lysine and poor in glycine and tryptophan, while the mummichog ZNF800 is rich in serine. 
Multiple programs showed that ZNF800 is likely to be a nuclear protein. NetPhos was used to predict the most likely phosphorylation sites (&gt;0.99). These were compared to experimentally shown phosphorylation sites found on NCBI Nucleotide and matching phosphorylation sites were bolded. Experimentally shown sumoylation sites were also included. The likely sites of Phosphorilation, O-Glycosilation, Sumoylation, and O-ß-GlcNAc attachment are detailed below: 
Homology / Evolution.
Paralogs of ZNF800.
ZNF800 has 5 possible paralogs, however, all of these had a maximum identity of 33%, so it is unlikely they are true paralogs of ZNF800. They may just be similar because they are all zinc finger proteins and contain zinc finger binding domains. When multiple sequence alignments were made, the zinc finger binding domains were the areas with the most conservation. 
Orthologs of ZNF800.
ZNF800 has homologs in trichoplax, invertebrates, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Based on the found E values of the protein with its orthologs in the aforementioned categories using NCBI Blast, ZNF800 is at least 930 Millions of years old. At first it was hypothesized that ZNF800 has an Ortholog in fungus, dating back to 1150 Millions of years ago, however, a BLAT search of the fungus sequence in the human domain gave no results, which lead to the conclusion that these sequences are not similar enough to prove they are truly related.
Interacting Proteins.
The most common transcription factors with high probability (&gt;0.84) of binding ZNF800 promoter are shown in the figure. These were found using the ElDorado genome database on Genomatrix. 
A few potential interacting proteins (depicted in Figure "Proteins Predicted to Interact with ZNF800" on the right) were found using STRING and yscP, plague bacteria, was shown to bind ZNF800 using Y2H data.
Clinical Significance.
While there is no obvious link so far between ZNF800 and specific diseases it may cause, several studies on GEO Profiles have shown a correlation between ZNF800 and disease condition, including a correlation between increased ZNF800 expression and chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia (ZNF800 GEO Profile 1), as well as a correlation between decreased ZNF800 expression and myotonic dystrophy type 2 (GEO Profile of ZNF800 Figure 2).
The 20 most common SNP's in the protein coding sequence of ZNF800 were analyzed, of these, the most common was still found in only 10% of the population. Of these mutations, none were in the zinc finger binding portions of ZNF800.
Suggested Reading.
Articles discussing ZNF800 are limited. There are 4 existing patents mention ZNF800 in lists of 100s-1000s, which address concepts such as “prostate cancer progression”, “progression risk of glaucoma”, “method for inducing pluripotency in human somatic cells”, and “modifying transcriptional regulatory networks in stem cells”. It is also mentioned in 27 patent applications, several of which have to do with cancer biomarkers.

Tan France

 
Tanveer Wasim "Tan" France (; ; born 20 April 1983) is a British-American fashion designer, television personality, and author. He is one of the first openly gay South Asian men on a major show and one of the first out Muslim gay men on western television as the fashion expert for the Netflix series "Queer Eye", host of the web series "Dressing Funny", and co-host of "Next In Fashion". His memoir, "Naturally Tan", was released in June 2019.
Early life.
Tanveer "Tan" Wasim was born and raised in South Yorkshire, England, to Muslim Pakistani parents. In his memoir, France has discussed how he felt alienated due to his experience of growing up in a strict Muslim household where homosexuality was viewed negatively, the lack of representation in media of his community and of LGBTQ South Asian people in particular, and his personal experiences of physical and verbal racism in his childhood and adult life. France said: "Our home wasn't super religious but we had a profound connection to our Muslim heritage."
France's interest in fashion began at a young age, inspired by the Disney clothing that was made in his grandparents' denim factory in Bury, England, where he spent time working. By age thirteen, he had learned how to construct and embellish a denim jacket. In 2019, he allegedly learned that his grandfather had to close the factory due to the products being Disney knockoffs.
France attended Hall Cross School and later Doncaster College, where he studied fashion, after which he moved to Manchester, and then to London.
Career.
After graduating from college, France began to work as designer and director for Zara, Selfridges, and Bershka, among other retailers, to further improve his knowledge of the wholesale business of retail; he later went on to work at a number of brands in order to learn more about manufacturing. He started in menswear and later progressed in womenswear, where he majored on his fashion degree.
France commented he would often work as stylist if a high-profile client came into the stores where he was working.
France began working in the United States in 2008, initially living in NYC, and immigrated to the US in 2015. France was company director at Shade Clothing before he opened his solo fashion company in 2011, called Kingdom &amp; State. The brand included clothing designed to meet Mormon clothing guidelines, a group that represented a significant population in Utah, where France was living. He later created two smaller apparel brands. France's designs were purchased by retailers ModCloth and Forever 21. The designs were displayed on the website and stores under the brand name for many years. In 2016 he later became co-founder, fashion designer, and CEO for the Rachel Parcell Inc clothing line, which was sold at Nordstrom.
After selling his businesses, France officially retired, having the intention to start a family with his husband, but he was later contacted by Netflix. This started his journey as a media figure through his role as the fashion expert on "Queer Eye", which premiered in February 2018. In 2019, France appeared in the music video for Taylor Swift's song "You Need to Calm Down. " He also appeared in 2020 in a special charity edition of "The Great British Bake Off" to raise funds for Stand Up To Cancer and was the winner of the episode. That year it was also announced that France would be co-hosting the new Netflix series "Next In Fashion" with Alexa Chung. In interviews with the ITV programme "This Morning" and with NPR, France disclosed that he had sold all three of his businesses after starting work for Netflix.
In 2019 he designed an eyewear line by partnering with EyeBuyDirect. Since 2019 he is a "GQ" Middle East official columnist. From 2020 he is "Express"’ monthly stylist.
France was nominated for an Emmy alongside his "Queer Eye" costars for best hosting as reality or competition program in July 2020. In September 2020, France was announced as a style instructor on MasterClass, an educational streaming video platform. In September 2020 The Tan France x Etsy limited edition collection was launched. France co-designed a collection of home decor and foods with thirteen independent sellers.
Personal life.
Tan currently lives in Salt Lake City, Utah, with his husband, Rob France, who is a pediatric nurse and illustrator.
France married his husband twice, first in London and then in NYC when it became legal. On April 13, 2021, Tan announced on Instagram that he and Rob were expecting their first child via surrogacy. Their son Ismail France was born seven weeks early on July 10, 2021 and had to spend three weeks in the NICU.
He released a memoir, "Naturally Tan", in June 2019 through St. Martin's Press. France has a deep love for cooking and especially baking. He learned how to cook and sew from age nine.
France was naturalized as a US citizen on 9 June 2020 after "working towards" it for ten years. He kept his British citizenship, making him a dual citizen of both countries.
In September 2019, France, who is vocal about the colorism, racism and Islamophobia he has endured throughout his life, created an Instagram account called "Shaded", in which he promotes black people, people of colour and cultural diversity. In September 2020, France revealed on an episode of "The Carlos Watson Show" that one of the primary reasons for him leaving the UK for the United States was racism.
Books.
France released a memoir, "Naturally Tan", in June 2019 through St. Martin's Press. It became a NYT best seller. It is about his experience growing up "gay in a traditional Muslim family, as one of the few people of colour in Doncaster, England." The memoir starts with Tan's childhood in England where episodes of racism were an everyday occurrence, like having to run back to school to avoid getting beat up by racist thugs. The book follows up with heavy topics such as colourism within the South Asian community and the Islamophobia he faced before and after the 9/11 attacks. For more lighthearted episodes of Tan's life he describes his first trip to NYC, how he started his brands, how he got involved in fashion, and how he fell in love with his husband, everything peppered with notions about fashion.

Serene Grand Orient of Greece

The Serene Grand Lodge of Greece is a Masonic Grand Lodge in Greece. The name was originally used by an organisation which existed from 1815—1843. After that time the Grand Lodge of Greece took its place. The present organisation under the name of the Serene Grand Lodge of Greece was refounded in 1986 by former members of the Grand Lodge. Today, they are firmly associated with Liberal Freemasonry, belonging to ISMAP and now CLIPSAS.
History.
Serene Grand Lodge of Greece, 1815—1843.
Freemasonry in Greece originated at the end of the 18th century on the Ionian Islands. At the time they were ruled by Venice and at Corfu in 1782 the "Loggia Beneficenza" was founded practicing the Rectified Scottish Rite, under the jurisdiction of Verona. Freemasonry was suppressed in 1785 in Venice and the Lodge closed. After Napoleon Bonaparte conquered the Venetian Empire, the lodge was revived in 1797 in Corcyre, until 1800 when the Russian Empire established the Septinsular Republic and suppressed Freemasonry. After the Treaty of Tilsit, the islands fell un der the First French Empire and thus Freemasonry was revived again. Two lodges in Corfu were merged as "Beneficenza-Filogenia Riunite".
The leader of this lodge, Count Dionisios Romas, was keen to establish recognition. First, in 21 November 1811, he applied to the Grand Orient de France to make it a Provincial Mother Lodge. This was accepted and new lodges sprung up. A new political reality emerged in 1815, when the United States of the Ionian Islands was established under the protection of the British Empire. At this time, Romas renamed the lodge the Serene Grand Lodge of Greece and eventually lodges were formed at Zante, Cephalonia, Lefkas and Patras. Roma decided to ask his friend, Augustus, Duke of Sussex, who was then the Grand Master of the United Grand Lodge of England, if he would become the Grand Master. Politically, Romas was hoping to get the British onside for the liberation of Greece from the Ottoman Empire (on the eve of the Greek War of Independence).
A significant number of Greeks who played a leading role in the War of Independence had earlier been involved in the Grand Orient. Involved were not just Greek nationalist revolutionaries and people influence by the Age of the Enlightenment, but also high ranking clerics of the Eastern Orthodox Church. This includes Emmanuil Xanthos (founder of the "Filiki Etaireia"), Germanos III of Old Patras, Gregory V of Constantinople, Theodoros Kolokotronis, Alexandros Mavrokordatos, Alexandros Ypsilantis, Alexandros Mourouzis, Ioannis Kapodistrias and others.

Mutational signatures

Mutational signatures are characteristic combinations of mutation types arising from specific mutagenesis processes such as DNA replication infidelity, exogenous and endogenous genotoxin exposures, defective DNA repair pathways, and DNA enzymatic editing.
The term is used for two distinct concepts, often conflated: mutagen signatures and tumor signatures. Its original use, mutagen signature, referred to a pattern of mutations made in the laboratory by a known mutagen and not made by other mutagens – unique to the mutagen as a human signature is unique to the signer. Uniqueness allows the mutagen to be deduced from a cell's mutations Later, the phrase referred to a pattern of mutations characteristic of a tumor type, although usually not unique to the tumor type nor to a mutagen. If a tumor mutational signature matches a unique mutagen mutational signature, it is valid to deduce the carcinogen exposure or mutagenesis process that occurred in the patient's distant past. Increasingly refined tumor signatures are becoming assignable to mutagen signatures.
Deciphering mutational signatures in cancer provides insight into the biological mechanisms involved in carcinogenesis and normal somatic mutagenesis. Mutational signatures have shown their applicability in cancer treatment and cancer prevention. Advances in the fields of oncogenomics have enabled the development and use of molecularly targeted therapy, but such therapies historically focused on inhibition of oncogenic drivers (e.g. "EGFR" gain-of-function mutation and EGFR inhibitor treatment in colorectal cancer). More recently, mutational signatures profiling has proven successful in guiding oncological management and use of targeted therapies (e.g. immunotherapy in mismatch repair deficient of diverse cancer types, platinum and PARP inhibitor to exploit synthetic lethality in homologous recombination deficient breast cancer).
General concepts.
Genomic data.
Cancer mutational signatures analyses require genomic data from cancer genome sequencing with paired-normal DNA sequencing in order to create the tumor mutation catalog (mutation types and counts) of a specific tumor. Different types of mutations (e.g. single nucleotide variants, indels, structural variants) can be used individually or in combination to model mutational signatures in cancer.
Types of mutations: base substitutions.
There are six classes of base substitution: C&gt;A, C&gt;G, C&gt;T, T&gt;A, T&gt;C, T&gt;G. The G&gt;T substitution is considered equivalent to the C&gt;A substitution because it is not possible to differentiate on which DNA strand (forward or reverse) the substitution initially occurred. Both the C&gt;A and G&gt;T substitutions are therefore counted as part of the "C&gt;A" class. For the same reason the G&gt;C, G&gt;A, A&gt;T, A&gt;G and A&gt;C mutations are counted as part of the "C&gt;G", "C&gt;T", "T&gt;A", "T&gt;C" and "T&gt;G" classes respectively.
Taking the information from the 5' and 3' adjacent bases (also called flanking base pairs or trinucleotide context) lead to 96 possible mutation types (e.g. A[C&gt;A]A, A[C&gt;A]T, etc.). The mutation catalog of a tumor is created by categorizing each single nucleotide variant (SNV) (synonyms: base-pair substitution or substitution point mutation) in one of the 96 mutation types and counting the total number of substitutions for each of these 96 mutation types (see figure).
Tumor mutation catalog.
 Once the mutation catalog (e.g. counts for each of the 96 mutation types) of a tumor is obtained, there are two approaches to decipher the contributions of different mutational signatures to tumor genomic landscape:
Identifying the contributions of diverse mutational signatures to carcinogenesis provides insight into tumor biology and can offer opportunities for targeted therapy.
Types of mutations: indels.
Signature 3, seen in homologous recombination (HR) deficient tumour, is associated with increased burden of large indels (up to 50 nucleotides) with overlapping microhomology at the breakpoints. In such tumors, DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by the imprecise repair mechanisms of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) instead of high fidelity HR repair.
Signature 6, seen in tumors with microsatellite instability, also features enrichment of 1bp indels in nucleotide repeat regions.
Types of mutations: structural variants.
Homologous recombination deficiency leads to Signature 3 substitution pattern, but also to increase burden of structural variants. In the absence of homologous recombination, non-homologous end joining leads to large structural variants such as chromosomal translocations, chromosomal inversions and copy number variants.
Mutational signatures.
Age-related mutagenesis.
Signature 1 features a predominance of C&gt;T transition (genetics) in the Np[C&gt;T]G trinucleotide contexts and correlates with the age of patient at time of cancer diagnosis. The underlying proposed biological mechanism is the spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
Signature 5 has a predominance of T&gt;C substitutions in the ApTpN trinucleotide context with transcriptional strand bias.
Homologous recombination deficiency.
Signature 3 displays high mutation counts of multiple mutation classes and is associated with germline and somatic (biology) "BRCA1" and "BRCA2" mutations in several cancer types (e.g. breast, pancreatic, ovarian, prostate). This signature results from DNA double-strand break repair deficiency (or homologous recombination deficiency). Signature 3 is associated with high burden of indels with microhomology at the breakpoints.
APOBEC enzymes.
APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminase enzymes respond to viral infections by editing viral genome, but the enzymatic activity of "APOBEC3A" and "APOBEC3B" has also been found to cause unwanted host genome editing and may even participate to oncogenesis in human papillomavirus-related cancers.
Signature 2 and Signature 13 are enriched for C&gt;T and C&gt;G substitutions and are thought to arise from cytidine deaminase activity of the AID/APOBEC enzymes family.
A germline deletion polymorphism involving "APOBEC3A" and "APOBEC3B" is associated with high burden of Signature 2 and Signature 13 mutations. This polymorphism is considered to be of moderate penetrance (two-fold above background risk) for breast cancer risk. The exact roles and mechanisms underlying APOBEC-mediated genome editing are not yet fully delineated, but activation-induced cytidine deaminase(AID)/APOBEC complex is thought to be involved in host immune response to viral infections and lipid metabolism.
Both Signature 2 and Signature 13 are feature cytosine to uracil substitutions due to cytidine deaminases. Signature 2 has a higher proportion of C[T&gt;C]N substitutions and Signature 13 a higher proportion of T[C&gt;G]N substitutions. "APOBEC3A" and "APOBEC3B"-mediated mutagenesis preferentially involve the lagging DNA strand during replication.
Mismatch repair deficiency.
Four COSMIC mutational signatures have been associated with DNA mismatch repair deficiency and found in tumors with microsatellite instability: Signature 6, 15, 20 and 26. Loss of function "MLH1", "MSH2", "MSH6" or "PMS2" genes cause defective DNA mismatch repair.
DNA proofreading.
Signature 10 has a transcriptional bias and is enriched for C&gt;A substitutions in the TpCpT context as well as T&gt;G substitutions in the TpTpTp context. Signature 10 is associated with altered function of DNA polymerase epsilon, which result in deficient DNA proofreading activity. Both germline and somatic "POLE (gene)" exonuclease domain mutations are associated with Signature 10.
Base excision repair.
Somatic enrichment for transversion mutations (G:C&gt;T:A) has been associated with base excision repair (BER) deficiency and linked to defective "MUTYH", a DNA glycosylase, in colorectal cancer. Direct DNA oxidation damage leads to the creation of 8-Oxoguanine, which if remains un-repaired, will lead to incorporation of adenine instead of cytosine during DNA replication. MUTYH encodes the adenine glycosylase enzyme which excise the mismatched adenine from 8-Oxoguanine:adenine base pairing, therefore enabling DNA repair mechanisms involving "OGG1" (Oxoguanine glycosylase) and "NUDT1" (Nudix hydrolase 1, also known as "MTH1", MutT homolog 1) to remove the damaged 8-Oxoguanine.
Exposures to exogenous genotoxins.
Selected exogenous genotoxins/carcinogens and their mutagen-induced DNA damage and repair mechanisms have been linked to specific molecular signatures.
Immunoglobulin gene hypermutation.
Signature 9 has been identified in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and malignant B-cell lymphoma and feature enrichment for T&gt;G transversion events. It is thought to result from error-prone polymerase ("POLH" gene)-associated mutagenesis.
Recently, polymerase error-prone synthesis signature has been linked to non-hematological cancers (e.g. skin cancer) and was hypothesized to contribute to YCG motif mutagenesis and could partly explain the increase TC dinucleotides substitutions.
History.
During the 1990s, Curtis Harris at the US National Cancer Institute and Bert Vogelstein at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore reviewed data showing that different types of cancer had their own unique suite of mutations in p53, which were likely to have been caused by different agents, such as the chemicals in tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light from the sun. With the advent of next-generation sequencing, Michael Stratton saw the potential for the technology to revolutionize our understanding of the genetic changes inside individual tumors, setting the Wellcome Sanger Institute's huge banks of DNA-sequencing machines in motion to read every single letter of DNA in a tumor. By 2009, Stratton and his team had produced the first whole cancer genome sequences. These were detailed maps showing all the genetic changes and mutations that had occurred within two individual cancers—a melanoma from the skin and a lung tumor. The melanoma and lung cancer genomes were powerful proof that the fingerprints of specific culprits could be seen in cancers with one major cause. These tumors still contained many mutations that could not be explained by ultraviolet light or tobacco smoking. The detective work became a lot more complicated for cancers with complex, multiple or even completely unknown origins. By way of analogy, imagine a forensic scientist dusting for fingerprints at a murder scene. The forensic scientist might strike it lucky and find a set of perfect prints on a windowpane or door handle that match a known killer. However, they are much more likely to uncover a mish-mash of fingerprints belonging to a whole range of folk—from the victim and potential suspects to innocent parties and police investigators—all laid on top of each other on all sorts of surfaces. This is very similar to cancer genomes where multiple mutational patterns are commonly overlaid one over another making the data incomprehensible. Fortunately, a PhD student of Stratton's, Ludmil Alexandrov came up with a way of mathematically solving the problem. Alexandrov demonstrated that mutational patterns from individual mutagens found in a tumor can be distinguished from one another using a mathematical approach called blind source separation. The newly disentangled patterns of mutations were termed mutational signatures. In 2013, Alexandrov and Stratton published the first computational framework for deciphering mutational signatures from cancer genomics data. Subsequently, they applied this framework to more than seven thousand cancer genomes creating the first comprehensive map of mutational signatures in human cancer. Currently, more than one hundred mutational signatures have been identified across the repertoire of human cancer.

MeLo-X

Sean Rhoden, known professionally MeLo-X, is an American disc jockey and record producer. MeLo-X co-wrote two songs for Beyoncé's "Lemonade" album in 2016: "Hold-Up" and "Sorry".
MeLo-X is one half of the electro/dancehall/reggae duo Electric Punanny, along with Jasmine Solano. They have toured internationally, performing deejay sets at festivals such as Glastonbury, Afropunk and SXSW.
Early life.
MeLo-X was born to Jamaican parents in the East Flatbush neighborhood of the New York City borough of Brooklyn.
Career.
In 2009, MeLo-X toured with Theophilus London, serving as deejay. On the side, he remixed songs from other artists, without permission.
In 2014, MeLo-X remixed five songs from Beyoncé's album "Beyoncé", the project titled "Yoncé-X", which MeLo-X posted to various websites such as SoundCloud and YouTube. Beyoncé's label kept having the remix album removed from each new hosting site for copyright violations, but after seeing the uploaded video for "Drunk in Lust," MeLo-X's unauthorized remix of "Drunk in Love," Beyoncé invited him to make music for the On the Run Tour, a co-headlining tour by Jay-Z and Beyoncé. MeLo-X relates: "They already had the story and the outline for the tour. The whole story is like you're watching a film and it's narrated by the music that they created... We'd sit and talk about the sounds. Then I'd go and create something. It was a mix of my ideas, with Beyoncé and Jay Z. I'd try to complement them. I'd try to find a meeting point of what I do and what they wanted." MeLo-X said that, for a climactic car-chase scene, he took Kanye West's song "Hell of a Life", changing and chopping it in the trap EDM style, making it into a two-minute piece to fit the concert visuals.
After this, MeLo-X collaborated with Beyoncé and Jay-Z in writing two songs for Beyoncé's "Lemonade" album: "Hold-Up" and "Sorry". "Hold Up" was certified Gold in the U.S. and Australia, and "Sorry" was certified Platinum in the U.S. MeLo-X said he encountered the song "Hold Up" after much of it had been composed by Father John Misty and MNEK. MeLo-X wrote some of the song's lyrics, and provided background vocals, saying, "I love how my vocals were used because it feels like it's a sample under her voice during the chorus." The song "Sorry" was co-written and co-produced by MeLo-X and Wynter Gordon. As well, MeLo-X scored the music for Beyoncé's "Lemonade" visual album.
MeLo-X also created music and sounds for Beyoncé's The Formation World Tour. For instance, when a mechanical lift at center stage rises upward, a sound that MeLo-X designed is played to represent the movement.
MeLo-X released an EP titled "Curate" in October 2015. The EP took the form of a software application within which the listener can move a pointer to change the beat and the reverb. MeLo-X calls the octahedron-shaped pointer the "infinity stone." Songs on the EP feature performances by Little Simz, Raury, and Kilo Kish. The next year, PartyNextDoor hired MeLo-X to bring the same visual style to his Summer's Over Tour.
MeLo-X produced and performed on a remix of the song "Find Your Way Back" on the deluxe version of Beyonce's album "" which was released on July 31, 2020, to coincide with the release of the Knowles-Carter/Disney + film "Black Is King".
Electric Punanny.
In 2007, MeLo-X met Jasmine Solano at the Sway nightclub in New York City. They collaborated in 2008 to create a monthly deejay party under the name Electric Punanny. The music is a fusion of electro-funk, dancehall and reggae. Early shows were at the 205 Club, but the show gained a larger following at the Sway Lounge. The duo began to tour internationally and to release music together. In 2013, they performed in France, Japan and Australia, including a set for the Island Vibe Festival on Stradbroke Island (Minjerribah). Personal electronics maker House of Marley sponsored a tour of North America in early 2014, including a performance at the "Do Over Party" in Palm Springs after the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. In June 2014, Electric Punanny played the Glastonbury Festival, at the Blues Stage in the Silver Hayes area. They played at the Afropunk Festival in Brooklyn in August 2014. The group's techno-dancehall mashup "Rosa Caleta" was their first release together in October 2014, the song named after a Jamaican restaurant in Berlin. After performing in China, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore, the duo played SXSW in March 2015. In 2017, Electric Punanny released the song "Tiger Eye" featuring Donae'o. This was followed by "Gymnastics On Fire", a summer jam featuring the Afro-R&amp;B collective The.Wav, released on the EPINTL label by Beatport.
Musical style and influences.
MeLo-X brings together in his music many different musical genres, especially dancehall and reggae from his family's Jamaican heritage. His deejay sets often combine tropical grooves with various hip hop and electronic dance beats. MeLo-X cites Big Pun, the Hot Boys, and rapper DMX along with his producer Swizz Beatz as inspirations for his own music career.
Photography.
After taking a trip to Equatorial Guinea and South Africa, MeLo-X had a showing of his photography in 2014 at the Sean Kelly Gallery in New York.

National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority

The National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (Arabic: Al-Gehaz Al-Qawmy l-Tanzeem Al-Etisalat), commonly known as NTRA, is the Egypt government-approved regulatory and competition authority that was established in accordance of the Egyptian telecommunication regulation law No. 10/ 2003 as the national authority equipped to regulate and administer the telecommunications region. Regulating the competition environment between the operators inside the industry according to the Egyptian constitution was a huge mandatory case after the huge rate of telecommunication technology growth, as well as ensuring the availability of qualitative and green telecommunications services.
The Egyptian Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) corporations have supported the Egyptian constitutions rules through a selection of channels, of strong nationwide telecommunications infrastructure paved the manner for the development of a number of important telecommunications sectors.
History.
The awareness of the ICT strategic value increased by the governments around the world nowadays, the Government of Egypt (GoE) categorized the ICT sector as an important part of the national economy, because its innovative and creative potential and providing enabling services, high technologies and products that support the Egyptian economy development in the global market. In Egypt, during the last years, the achievements of this sector have emerge as felt in all spheres of existence as network infrastructure and the usage of ICT equipment have unfold. Egypt's ICT sector is now an important aspect of the countrywide economic system, a key driving force of development, and a catalyst for greater performance and performance throughout sectors.
It helps to provide a competitive statistics and information and communications technology environment to improve the information society and financial diversification throughout fair law. as Egyptians increasingly more follow ICT tools in all areas of life, they are efficiently forging a digital society – to the advantage of people, commercial enterprise and society. In assist of this, MCIT focused on developing ICT talent levels, both to empower more people through access to the information society and to make certain a regular supply of human resources with the ICT capabilities required within the ICT zone and somewhere else.
Egyptian revolution of 2011
In Egypt, ICTs supplied the impetus for the 25 January Revolution, and round the world they have changed how the government's regulations are shaped and economies are run. The “communications revolution” as soon as proclaimed via academics and ICT experts is now a fact. In Egypt, furthermore, it has given upward thrust to a pioneering social movement that makes use of statistics and communications equipment to promote democracy and excellent governance. In Egyptian revolution of 2011, social networks including Facebook and Twitter provided an essential platform to a huge base of citizens, allowing them to take part in community talk based on fairness and transparency. MCIT is running to support this trend and to promote democracy, simply because it has constantly labored for the development of Egyptian society. The Egyptian regulator has been taking the lead in regions that force the development of the communications enterprise, as pursuant to the telecom law regulation no. 10/2003, it enjoys the juristic character and economic independence to be able to meet its mandates as set forth within the law. In the framework of those mandates, there is a seeks to improve its capabilities in ensuring the availability of telecom services to all areas all through the country, which includes the economic and developmental areas in addition to the urban, rural and far off areas, as well as, Assisting to create a healthy funding environment primarily based on fair competition and same opportunities standards. Also, growing and promoting suitable techniques and rules that enhance the infrastructure improvement and use of ICT services; presenting incentives to traders through the popular service fund to encourage them to offer far areas with the fundamental telecom services. and organizing the interconnection agreements among official operators with the intention to assure efficiency and honest internet working practices inside the telecom region.
Scope of Work.
Policy and Licensing.
The regulatory policy the national telecommunications plan make sure of the quality of the telecommunication networks and services are supplied at inexpensive fees for all citizens. Additionally, forming a licensing framework for liberalized offerings and developing a licensing system for networks and services covering character licenses and sophistication licenses for all telecommunication applications. Regulations were approved according to the Egyptian constitution; to prohibit anti-competitive practices, which include the misuse of a dominant role side, pass-subsidization, refusal to supply main facilities, vertical charge squeezing, misuse of data and restrictive agreements as well as planning to create an appropriate environment for the marketplace liberalization where there will be a free competition and investment. The government has approved the certified telecommunications operators in Egypt. The framework guarantees that everyone licensees are dealt fairly and in a non-discriminatory manner, and identifies the technical, industrial, legal and regulatory regulations had to make sure green and fair internet working practices within the telecommunication marketplace.
NTRA denies blocking voice calling services (Skype, WhatsApp and Viber) in Egypt.
On 8 October 2015, a lot of Egyptian internet users could not be able to use voice calling platforms such as : Skype, WhatsApp, or Viber. Many reports claimed that VoIP calls were blocked in 2010 in Egypt, but apparently this was extended to add the WhatsApp to the list during October 2015. Other conflicting reports about the Egyptian policy regarding blocking. However, official statements from NTRA deny blocking, but after complaining it was mentioned in the news paper that the decision were made by the NTRA. On 20 April 2016, the lawsuit forced the NTRA to announce the list of the websites that was blocked in Egypt; to divulge the criteria upon which they were blocked. On 12 June 2016, NTRA denied blocking Viber and other calling services although they are providing unlicensed international calls and are therefore illegal. NTRA claimed that they need to be licensed first, while denying any blockage at the same time.
On 30 March 2017, the same problem happened again and one of the mobile operators denied blocking the services; because the three main mobile operators cannot disable the VoIP services without NTRA approval. The National Telecom Regulatory Authority (NTRA) announced that the authority has nothing to do with this interruption and that it reassure again that news regarding this issue is incorrect. Many newspaper reported that the issue occurred because of ostensibly security concerns, but there's also a suspicion there are economic incentives for local operators who have complained to regulators about free international calls. The partial disruption comes after terrorist attacks killed 47 people in two churches. The emergency law allows authorities sweeping powers including monitoring personal communications without judicial oversight and shuttering media outlets.
Frequency spectrum management.
The national frequency spectrum development plan for the MCIT growth and optimizing utilization of the frequency spectrum according with worldwide policies. As a result, this will maximize the financial advantages of the frequency spectrum. Some other taken steps due to frequency spectrum management such as tracking the frequency spectrum in order to avoid harmful interference and assigning frequencies to clients without affecting national protection and defense, as well as having a frequency notification and registration. A worldwide coordination was created with the other nations on frequency spectrum usage through working within the pursuits of national defense and protection, and supporting regulation enforcement and crime prevention.
Research &amp; Development.
The planning and development of the telecommunications zone in Egypt and to this includes incorporates out technical researches, tracks new technologies and works to resolve technical troubles. Researches on unique subjects were conducted by NTRA, sometimes in cooperation with outdoor specialists and experts institutes, to be able to encourage funding and therefore make sure the availability of new services in the marketplace, as well as identifying and studying the key industry interpretation indicators to draw national and worldwide investment opportunities. and engaging in studies evaluation and economic interpretation of modern and newly introduced telecom services to make certain market liberalization and purchaser welfare. and assessing a cost model to make sure that telecom services price lists are price-oriented and to assure that services are in moderate price.
Industry.
On 9 December 2003, there was a supervision institutes that run courses leading to internationally identified telecommunications certification, consisting of GMDSS, in step with regulations set through the involved establishments and growing curricula and examination structures; tracking the guidelines and technical progress of institutes; and growing policies for issuing, canceling or enhancing certificates. The MCIT followed the Ofcom in setting registration strategies of wireless devices importing businesses, submitting the organizations' Wi-Fi devices importation requests to the relevant committee as per the relevant regulation. and following up on keep report of the wireless devices through periodic inspections of these organizations, and following up at the movement and sale of such devices to make sure those organizations' abidance via the provisions of law. As well as making the strategies for getting the approvals required for the importation and utilization of Wi-Fi networks hubs, to make the decisions issued by the capable committee as according to the provisions of the relevant regulation regarding the clients' requests or utilization of Wi-Fi devices.

During her tenure as deputy regent, Vice Governor Agus Arifin Nu'mang presented Indriani with the Fajar Institute of Pro Otonomi Award for excellence in public participation following her innovations using the USAID-supported Kinerja program. Her work with the program has continued into her tenure as regent due to her devotion to the issue of education equality as well as her efforts to make regency budgeting data publicly available to all citizens.

Rhode Island School for the Deaf

Rhode Island School for the Deaf (RISD or RISDeaf) is a school for deaf students in Rhode Island, United States, established in 1876.
History.
Founding.
The school was founded on the initiative of the parents of Jeanie Lippitt, who became deaf due to scarlet fever when she was four years old in 1856. Her mother, Mary Ann Lippitt, taught Jeanie to communicate through lip reading and speaking.
Jeanie's father, Henry Lippitt, became governor of Rhode Island in 1875. During these years, Jeanie visited the Rhode Island State house to convince members of the General Assembly to establish a school for deaf children. Henry's political endorsements allowed Jeanie's wishes to come true in 1877 when the General Assembly passed a bill to found a deaf school. The Rhode Island School for the Deaf is still functioning today in 2018.
Post-founding.
Circa 1966 John F. Fogarty, a member of the Legislature of Rhode Island, got into a conflict with Governor of Rhode Island John Chafee after Fogarty accused the school of being poorly run. The State Board of Education hired three outside consultants and they wrote a report criticizing the management of the school, asking for it to be restructured. It specifically criticized how there were no refurbishments since 1935 and it also criticized the dormitories though the report was not sure whether the dormitories should be abolished.

Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies

The Association of Statisticians of American Religious Bodies (ASARB) is an American non-profit organization that brings together statisticians from various religious groups in the United States, with the aim of compiling accurate statistics regarding all such groups. It was established in 1935 and is based in Lenexa, Kansas. Since 1990, it has sponsored the US Religion Census, a national survey of Americans' religious beliefs conducted independently of, but at the same time as, the United States Census. This survey had previously been conducted by the National Council of Churches. It has become increasingly important since the US Census stopped asking Americans about their religion after World War II.

Janthinoidea is a superfamily of sea snails containing wentletraps (Epitoniidae) and surfing snails (Janthinidae). It includes species that have tethered egg masses, some of which are used for flotation.
Phylogeny.
Molecular evidence supports a tree for Janthinoidea that shows the sequential development of traits for a neustonic life. The wentletraps (Epitoniidae) have tethered egg masses that started to be used for flotation in "Recluzia" and then totally divorce from its original function for the ovoviviparous "Janthina janthina".

Gravel and Tar Classic

Gravel and Tar is a one-day cycling race, held annually in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, since 2016, finishing in Palmerston North. It is rated 1.2 and has been part of UCI Oceania Tour since 2018. The race is primarily on sealed roads, however the highlight of the race is the multiple gravel sectors (usually 5 or 6) throughout the course. The race is now considered to be the toughest one-day elite race in the Oceania region. The race is held in January each year, making it one of the first races on the UCI Calendar, and a key chance for teams and riders to gain early UCI points. The event has seen teams enter from countries such as Sweden, Japan, the US, and Australia, alongside with the best New Zealand men's trade teams.
Palmerston North was the starting location of the race for its first three years, before the race start moved to its current location in Feilding in 2019. The race course often transverses the gravel roads on the watersheds near Pohangina, and the peloton is easily fractured due to punctures &amp; crashes on these sectors. As a result of these fractures the race will very rarely see large bunches finish together, and many racers miss the time cut or are unable to finish.
The Gravel and Tar La Femme is the women's version of the race, held on the same day, and introduced in 2019. The La Femme race also holds a UCI 1.2 rating, and is one of a few elite female cycle races in the world where the prizemoney on offer is the same as the men's race. The race generally follows a shorter but similar course to the men's race, starting and finishing in the same locations.
In 2021, the race expanded to include a series of wraparound events over the race weekend, being labelled the Manawatu Cycling Spree. This includes:

Microtis atrata

Microtis atrata, commonly known as the swamp mignonette orchid or yellow onion orchid and sometimes as Microtidium atratum, is a species of orchid endemic to southern Australia. It has a single thin leaf and up to forty or more yellowish-green flowers. The flowers are the smallest of any Australian ground-dwelling orchid. The orchid usually grows in large colonies after fire and although small, are easily seen because of their very large numbers in their blackened surroundings.
Description.
"Microtis atrata" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, more or less solid leaf, long and about wide. Between two and forty or more yellowish-green flowers are densely crowded along a flowering stem long, reaching to a height of . The plants are sometimes up to tall if growing in water. At about long and wide, the flowers are the smallest of any terrestrial Australian orchid, and as they age, they turn black. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped to round, about long and wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are oblong, less than long and spread apart from each other. The petals are egg-shaped and concave and the labellum is oblong to egg-shaped. Flowering occurs from September to December and is stimulated by fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis atrata" was first formally described in 1840 by John Lindley and the description was published in "A Sketch of the Vegetation of the Swan River Colony". The specific epithet ("atrata") is a Latin word meaning "dressed in black", referring to the colour of the dried flowers.
Some authorities give this species the name "Microtidium atratum" but this name is not widely accepted.
Distribution and habitat.
The swamp mignonette orchid occurs in the south-west of Western Australia, the south-east of South Australia, in southern Victoria and northern Tasmania. It grows in swampy places and in winter-wet depressions, sometimes in standing water and can form colonies of enormous numbers of plants after summer fire.
Conservation.
"Microtis atrata" is classified as "not threatened" in Western Australia by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, but is regarded as "endangered" in South Australia and as "rare" in Tasmania.

Anders Daae (priest)

Anders Daae (December 20, 1680 – May 18, 1763) was a Norwegian priest and landowner.
Life.
Daae was born in Trondheim, the son of Jonas Edvardsen (a.k.a. Jon Effuertsen, died 1683 or 1688), a townsman of Trondheim. Jonas Edvardsen did not use the surname "Daae". After Jonas Edvardsen died, Simon Hoff, the chancellor of the cathedral school in Trondheim, served as Daae's guardian. The origin of "Daae", the surname he adopted, is unknown or uncertain. Daae's mother was Kiersten Jensdatter (died 1683). Anders Daae is believed to have started using the surname "Daae" after he was admitted to the University of Copenhagen. Daae was indigent when he graduated. In Copenhagen he lived in Regentzen, a building for poor students. After he took his theology exam, he spent two years as a private tutor for a bailiff in Nordmøre, and then he traveled back to Copenhagen in 1705 with the hope of receiving a clerical position.
Daae served as a provost and the parish priest at Vik in Sogn from 1708 onward, holding the position for nearly 55 years. Daae served under seven different bishops of Bergen. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan was not particularly pleased with Daae. He is said to have received his clerical position in Vik by visiting the royal castle in Copenhagen and with the assistance of Princess Sophia Hedwig. According to Lampe, Daae accumulated a fortune of 40,000 rixdollars. He owned churches along with land and tithes, as well as several other properties in both Outer and Inner Sogn. Daae married Birgitte Ludvigsdatter Munhte (1686–1770) in 1709. It was probably Birgitte that initially expanded the couple's wealth. Bishop Erik Pontoppidan carried out a visitation in 1749 and noted that Daae had accumulated much land and was considered the richest priest in the diocese. He owned both of the churches in Vik and the church in Lærdal, and he also received payment for renting land that was owned by the church or that he himself owned. In the diocese, Anders and Birgitte's sons inherited property worth 6,000 rixdollars each, and their daughters 3,000 rixdollars each.
Daae is said to have been a strict priest that often reproached people for their sins. He is also believed to have been caught up by the Pietism movement, which had started in Germany. Daae established a school for commoners in 1741, and there are many local oral traditions concerning Daae as a priest in Vik. Daae died in Vik.
Extended family.
His wife Birgitte was the daughter of Ludvig Christophersen Munthe (1657–1708), the previous priest in Vik, and via her great-grandfather Ludvig Munthe she was also a second cousin of Ludvig Holberg. Birgitte's mother was Karen Leganger (daughter of the priest Iver Leganger), and she lived with her maternal grandmother Anna Finde (Leganger's widow). For a while, he had two of his sons at the same time as "personal curates" in Vik. Several of Birgitte's brothers were priests. Her sister Anna Ludvigsdatter Munthe was married to Anders Daae's curate Jens Garman. Her sister Helene was also married to a priest.
Descendants.
Anders Daae and Birgitte Munthe had eleven children (or which seven reached adulthood), giving rise to one of the largest family of civil servants in Western Norway. Around 1800 there were six parish priests from the Daae family in Sogn. By the 20th century, Anders Daae and Birgitte Munthe's descendants included at least 25 priests and many wives of priests. The surname Daae was used by Anders and Birgitte's descendants.

Jingmenvirus

Jingmenvirus is a group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with segmented genomes. They are primarily associated with arthropods and are the only known segmented RNA viruses that infect animal hosts. The first member of the group, the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV), was described in 2014. Another member, the Guaico Culex virus (GCXV), has a highly unusual multicomponent architecture in which the genome segments are separately enclosed in different viral capsids.
Examples.
Jingmen tick virus.
The first member of the group was described in 2014 and named the Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) because it was isolated from a tick sampled in Jingmen, China. It is an enveloped spherical virus slightly larger than its closest viral relatives. The JMTV genome has four segments, two of which contain genes with sequence homology to non-structural proteins found in flaviviruses, including methyltransferase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The putative structural proteins in the JMTV genome have no known homologs. In addition to identification in ticks, JMTV has also been identified in low abundances in mosquitoes such as "Aedes albopictus".
Guaico Culex virus.
The Guaico Culex virus (GCXV) was reported in 2016 after isolation from "Culex" mosquitoes found near Guaico, Trinidad. Different isolates of the virus have either four or five genome segments, though the fifth is not essential for viral proliferation. GCXV is a multicomponent (also known as multipartite) virus in which each genome segment is enclosed in its own small enveloped viral capsid. At least three genome segments, containing genes for non-structural proteins and capsid components, must enter a cell in order to successfully infect it and reproduce the virus. Before the discovery of GMXV, multicomponent architecture had previously been reported only in viruses that infect plants and fungi, and had never been observed in an enveloped virus.
Other viruses.
Genetic material that likely belongs to other jingmenviruses can be identified through bioinformatics. In some cases, such sequences were not recognized as viral or the segmented nature of the genome was not recognized before JMTV was described. For example, the reported genome of the dog parasite "Toxocara canis" was found to contain sequences with homology to JMTV, likely representing a viral infection in the parasite that was sequenced. The Mogiana tick virus, first reported in 2011, is a similar example; its segmented genome was not recognized on first publication but was reanalyzed and identified as a jingmenvirus in 2017.
Sequences with homology to JMTV have also been isolated from a red colobus monkey, suggesting the possibility of a segmented, possibly multicomponent virus capable of infecting primates. A metagenomics study of arthropod flaviviruses identified five additional examples of likely jingmenvirus sequences.
Evolution.
Jingmenviruses are related to flaviviruses, which have non-segmented genomes transmitted in a single capsid. Homology has consistently been observed between the genes encoding non-structural proteins of jingmenviruses and flaviviruses, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. However, the genomic architecture of the homologous genes varies significantly; the canonical flavivirus genome consists of a single open reading frame (ORF) whose protein product is processed by proteases, whereas the non-structural jingmenvirus proteins are encoded on two genome segments, each containing one ORF. Although there are few known jingmenvirus sequences, the gene composition of the genome segments appears to be well-conserved. By contrast, the putative jingmenvirus structural proteins that likely make up its capsids have no homology to known proteins.
It is striking that the segmented jingmenviruses' closest known relatives are nonsegmented. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying genome segmentation and especially multicomponent architecture are poorly understood. Although segmented genomes appear to have evolved several times in the virome, the evolutionary mechanism underlying this structure is unclear. It is likewise unclear whether multicomponent architecture is a distinct evolutionary strategy or is an artifact of the mechanism of segmentation, possibly via the formation of defective interfering particles.

Huang Xuhua

Huang Xuhua (; born 12 March 1926) is a Chinese mechanical engineer and submarine designer, and was one of the chief designers for the country's first generation of nuclear submarines (Type 091 and Type 092). He is director emeritus of the Wuhan-based 719 Research Institute (Nuclear Submarine Institute) of China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation, and is an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. His name was classified until 1987.
Biography.
Huang was born on 12 March 1926 in Swabue, Kwangtung Province, of Jieyang ancestry. He graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 1949.
After the Sino-Soviet split, Marshal Nie Rongzhen proposed that China develop its own nuclear submarines to break the duopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union, and Mao Zedong accepted the suggestion. In 1958, Huang was among the 29 people selected to develop the program, meant to bolster China's nuclear deterrence against the US and the USSR. They were based in Huludao, a port on the Bohai Sea in Liaoning Province.
At the time China was in the midst of the great famine caused by the Great Leap Forward, and technical knowledge was severely limited. Huang and his colleagues had very primitive resources, using abacuses to do calculations and gathering information from foreign newspapers. When a Chinese diplomat brought from the US toy models of the George Washington-class submarine, Huang was elated to find out that the design his team had made on paper was almost identical to the models.
When the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution swept through China, Huang and other engineers came under persecution. In the late 1960s, Huang, together with scientist Qian Lingxi, was attacked for his "reactionary" background and sent to perform hard labour in the countryside, where he spent two years raising pigs. In retrospect, Huang remembered these years as "the only easy time" of his life, as he had no responsibilities other than feeding the pigs.
In 1970, the "Long March I", China's first nuclear submarine, began maritime tests. She entered service in 1974, making China the fifth country to own a nuclear submarine, after the United States, the USSR, the United Kingdom, and France. The boat was decommissioned more than four decades later, and is now displayed in the Chinese Navy Museum in Qingdao. In 1979, Huang was appointed as one of the three deputies to the first chief designer Peng Shilu, for China's nuclear submarine project, and the other two were and Huang Weilu. The first nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) of class 092 was completed and commissioned in 1981. In 1983, Huang Xuhua succeeded Peng as the 2nd chief designer and continued working on the nuclear submarine project.
Honours and publicity.
In November 2017, Huang was awarded the honour of "National Model for Virtue". In a nationally televised ceremony in Beijing, to show his respect for two senior citizens who dedicated their lives to contribute to the nation, Paramount leader Xi Jinping personally invited Huang to sit next to him for a group photo. The event was widely reported in Chinese media.
In September 2019, Huang was awarded the Medal of the Republic, China's highest order of honour. In January 2020, he was conferred the Highest Science and Technology Award, together with meteorologist Zeng Qingcun.
Huang was often hailed in Chinese media as "the father of China's nuclear submarines", but this has been disputed by the naval writer Li Zhongxiao and some scientific-technical staff of the first generation of China's nuclear submarines. According to them, the nuclear submarine was developed by many scientists and did not have a single "father"; and if a single person were to be considered the "father", it should be Peng Shilu, the first chief designer, not Huang, who succeeded Peng as the second chief designer.
Personal life.
Huang is married and has three daughters. His immediate family moved with him to Huludao for his secret mission, but he had to reduce contact with the rest of his family. He only rarely visited his parents in Guangdong, who had no idea what he was doing until his role was made public in a 1987 magazine article.

Diargon

Diargon or the argon dimer is a molecule containing two argon atoms. Normally, this is only very weakly bound together by van der Waals forces (a van der Waals molecule). However, in an excited state, or ionised state, the two atoms can be more tightly bound together, with significant spectral features. At cryogenic temperatures, argon gas can have a few percent of diargon molecules.
Theory.
Two argon atoms are attracted together by van der Waals forces when far from each other. When they are close, electrostatic forces repel them. There is a balance point where the van der Waals force matches the opposing repelling force, where energy is at a minimum, represented as the trough in the graph of interaction energy versus distance. This distance is the ground state of the unexcited argon dimer. In a vibrating molecule, the distance between the atoms bounces backwards and forwards from one side of the trough to the other. Faster vibrations will force the state up to higher levels in the energy trough. If the vibration is two much the molecule will break up. In a rotating molecule, the centrifugal force drags the atoms apart, but can still be overcome by the attractive force. But if the rotation is too much the atoms break apart.
Properties.
The ionisation energy of the neutral molecule is 14.4558 eV (or 116593 cm−1).
The dissociation energy of neutral Ar2 in the ground state is 98.7 cm−1 which is hundreds of times weaker than that of typical molecules. The dissociation energy of Ar2+ is 1.3144 eV or 10601 cm−1.
The Ar2 molecule can exist in a number of different vibration and rotational states. If the molecule is not rotating, there are eight different vibration states. But if the molecule spins fast, vibration is more likely to shake it apart, and at the 30th rotational level there are only two stable and one metastable state of vibration. In combination, there are 170 different possibilities that are stable. In the metastable states, energy will be released if the molecule breaks apart into two separate atoms, but some extra energy is required to overcome the attraction between the atoms. Quantum tunneling can result in the molecule breaking apart with no extra energy. However this takes time, which can vary from 10−11 seconds to several centuries. Molecules crashing into each other also results in breakup of the van der Waals molecules. At standard conditions this only takes about 100 picoseconds.
Excited states.
Neutral.
99.6% of the argon isotopes are 40Ar, so the spectrum observed in natural argon dimer will be due to the 40Ar40Ar isotopomer. The following table lists different excited states.

Cherprang Areekul (; born 2 May 1996) is a member of the Thai idol girl group BNK48, an international sister group of the Japanese idol girl group AKB48.
She is one of the first-generation members of the group, and is also the first and current captain of the group.
She was known as a cosplayer prior to joining BNK48 in 2017. In 2018, she began her acting career with a lead role in "Homestay", a GDH 559's film released in October that year.

Idol.
Cherprang learnt of the 48 Group through the anime "AKB0048", which was based on the idol group AKB48. She was originally a fan of the anime, and when she later realised that the group is real, she became a fan of the group too.
In July 2016, the 20-year-old Cherprang was attracted by the recruitment of members of BNK48, a new sister group of AKB48 in Thailand, but the applicants were required to be aged between 12–18 years only. The subsequent expansion of the age limit to 22 years enabled her application. When asked about what made her decide to become a member of an idol group, she said: "I'm a fan of AKB48. I wanted to know what my idols went through to become famous." She also said that her father initially disapproved of her working as an idol.
Out of the total 1,500 applicants, 300 and 80 girls respectively passed the initial auditions. Cherprang was amongst the 29 persons who passed the final audition, and became a trainee of BNK48 when the group was announced at Japan Expo 2017 on 12 February 2017.

Saladin Ayubi Brigade

The Saladin Ayubi Brigade (, ) was a mainly-Syrian Kurdish armed rebel group that fought in the Syrian Civil War as part of the Free Syrian Army. Formed in May 2012 and named after the early Kurdish Muslim leader Saladin, the group was led by defected Syrian Army Captain Bewar Mustafa and fought against Syrian government forces in and around the city of Aleppo. It was also strongly opposed to the Kurdish-led Democratic Union Party (PYD), and have clashed with the PYD-affiliated People's Protection Units (YPG) and the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) several times. 
Ideology.
Although the majority of fighters within the Saladin Ayubi Brigade were Kurds, the group also contained Arabs and Turkmen. Capt. Bewar Mustafa, commander of the group, stated during an interview in February 2013 that "We believe in democracy, equal rights for all, and representation. This is automatically against sectarianism. We are the Free Syrian Army for all Syrians, not just for one group, and the Kurds in this are a moderating force." Lieutenant Colonel Shawqi Othman, another commander in the group, also stated that "We want a civil, democratic government which treats everyone equally".
Despite ideological differences, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade closely cooperated with Islamist rebel groups, including the al-Tawhid Brigade and the Free Syria Brigade. The group defended this alliance by claiming that it was a way for them to "pay its dues to the revolution". It also fought alongside the Salafist jihadist al-Nusra Front. However, Capt. Mustafa exclaimed that "I swear to God, if some radicals want to go kill the Alawites, we will fight with our guns and die to defend the Alawites because we are the army for all Syrians."
In response to accusations that the Saladin Ayubi Brigade served agendas of Turkey, Mustafa replied with "First, I am a Kurd. I am proud of my nation. I do not need Turkey or any other country to guide me." In addition, Mustafa denied any affiliation with Salah Badr al-Din's wing of the Kurdish Freedom Party. 
Mustafa also stated in August 2013 that due to ideological differences, he will not join "any Kurdish project that has the YPG in it". Lt. Col. Othman claimed that the PYD and PKK were allied with the Syrian government. Mohammed Suleiman, an activist who worked with the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, called the PKK "mercenaries and criminals". Despite this, he stated that "If the choice is between Jabhat al-Nusra or the PKK, I will always choose the PKK."
History.
Establishment and early activities.
The Saladin Ayubi Battalion was formed in May 2012 by a group of armed Kurdish rebels, among them university students, in a village near Afrin. On 12 May, Captain Bewar Mustafa, a military engineer in the Syrian Army, defected to join the Free Syrian Army in the city of al-Rastan. Mustafa was among the FSA officers who met with members of the United Nations Supervision Mission in Syria in Rastan.
Later in mid-2012, Mustafa contacted members of the Saladin Ayubi Battalion and arrived in Afrin to join the group as its commander. After more fighters joined the group, it was renamed as the Saladin Ayubi Brigade. It participated in clashes against government forces around Aleppo, before entering the city itself and taking part in the Battle of Aleppo. Under the command of Capt. Mustafa, the group fought in the Karm al-Jabal, Ashrafiya, Khalidiya, and Bani Zaid neighbourhoods of Aleppo city. It also took part in the Siege of Menagh Air Base, the Siege of Nubl and Al-Zahraa, and cooperated with the Azadî Battalion along the frontline south of Aleppo International Airport. 
On 26 October 2012, clashes erupted between the YPG and other rebel groups, including the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, in the Ashrafiya neighbourhood of Aleppo. During the clashes on 1 November, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade captured Nujin Derik, a female YPG commander. The group, however, denied involvement in the clashes, and stated that it did not want to fight the YPG in Kurdish areas. On 5 November, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the YPG and PYD and FSA groups in Aleppo, promising the release of prisoners and closer cooperation in the fight against the Assad government. Derik was released 5 days later.
Later activities and dissolution.
On 15 April 2013, 8 defected Kurdish military officers from Syria, including Lt. Col. Shawqi Othman of the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, were kidnapped at the Iraq–Syria border by unknown parties. The officers were heading to Iraqi Kurdistan to join the Peshmerga. One of the officers' relatives accused the PYD of involvement in their abductions.
In September 2013, clashes renewed between the YPG and its ally, the Kurdish Front, and other rebel groups in Aleppo, including the Saladin Ayubi Brigade, part of the Syrian Kurdish Revolutionary Council (Komala). On 19 September, the 16th Division was formed, with the Saladin Ayubi Brigade as a member group. 
The pro-PYD Firat News Agency considered fighters of the group to be "mercenaries", and the 16th Division itself was considered "criminal gangs" by some residents in Aleppo, resulting in the group being attacked by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant since October 2013. As part of the 16th Division, the Saladin Ayubi Brigade fought ISIL in Aleppo at the end of 2013.
On 4 April 2014, the Syrian Kurdish Revolutionary Council (Komala), having left the 16th Division, joined the Syrian Revolutionaries Front. In its accession statement, Capt. Bewar Mustafa called the PYD "tools of repression and intimidation by the Assad regime". Despite this, Mustafa and the Komala announced solidarity with Kobanî when ISIL attacked the city in September 2014, and demanded the SRF to provide military assistance to the YPG-led forces fighting against the ISIL offensive. Komala withdrew from the SRF on 6 October when it failed to respond.
In 2015, Captain Bewar Mustafa laid down his arms, and the Saladin Ayubi Brigade last appeared in July 2015. During the Operation Olive Branch in early 2018, Mustafa called FSA fighters participating in the offensive "mercenaries" and "a tool in the hands of their masters, even against their own kinsmen". He also claimed that "both sides are going to lose".

Suite for the Green Eighties

Suite for the Green Eighties is an album by European jazz group the Vienna Art Orchestra which was first released in 1982 on the Hat ART label.
Reception.
The Allmusic review stated: "The five-part work is a crosshatch of jazz, blues, circus music, postmodern harmonic and intervallic invention, and dance music (as in ballet). The temptation to call it a pastiche is too easy to drape over this mammoth construction of color and texture in sound. Before this suite begins — and it is actually more like a symphony than a jazz suite — there are three Rüegg compositions that set the audience up for the drama.… When the "Suite" finally begins, listeners are almost taken off guard since it sounds like a coda. Before the vibes and trumpets go into a dance of intricate counterpoint, the band plays "fliessend," smoothly and evenly, and the movement becomes almost contemplative, with the exception of the two contrapuntal instruments now playing in restrained tones. As the bop horn lines state the theme for the rest of the suite, short, choppy interludes of dissonance and even sets of quiet tone rows are inserted into the melody! Rüegg's harmonic sensibility is so developed that he has no difficulties in traversing isorhythms to get to his desired place. By the time the last movement is reached, one would swear that all elegiac notions have been left behind in order to join Buddy Rich and Count Basie in a Kansas City block party. Swinging brass, jump-start rhythms, and angular solos carry the joyous suite to its impossible ending — in the quiet of the evening with only the feeling that something new is possible for the first time in a long, long while".

Memory protection unit

A memory protection unit (MPU), is a computer hardware unit that provides memory protection. It is usually implemented as part of the central processing unit (CPU). MPU is a trimmed down version of memory management unit (MMU) providing only memory protection support. It is usually implemented in low power processors that require only memory protection and do not need the full fledged feature of a memory management unit like virtual memory management. 
Overview.
The MPU allows the privileged software to define memory regions and assign memory access permission and memory attributes to each of them. Depending on the implementation of the processor, the number of supported memory regions will vary. The MPU on ARMv8-M processors supports up to 16 regions. The memory attributes define the ordering and merging behaviors of these regions, as well as caching and buffering attributes. Cache attributes can be used by internal caches, if available, and can be exported for use by system caches.
MPU monitors transactions, including instruction fetches and data accesses from the processor, which can trigger a fault exception when an access violation is detected. The main purpose of memory protection is to prevent a process from accessing memory that has not been allocated to it. This prevents a bug or malware within a process from affecting other processes, or the operating system itself.

True Detective (season 3)

The third season of "True Detective", an American anthology crime drama television series created by Nic Pizzolatto, was confirmed by HBO on August 31, 2017, and premiered on January 13, 2019. The story takes place in the Ozarks over three separate time periods, as partner detectives investigate a macabre crime involving two missing children. The opening theme of the season is the song "Death Letter" written by Son House and performed by Cassandra Wilson from her 1995 album "New Moon Daughter".
Mahershala Ali plays the lead role of detective Wayne Hays, while Stephen Dorff plays his partner detective Roland West. The season marks Pizzolatto's directorial debut, with the series creator dividing up directing assignments with Jeremy Saulnier and Daniel Sackheim. Pizzolatto also serves as the showrunner and sole writer of the season, with the exception of the fourth and sixth episode, which he co-wrote with David Milch and Graham Gordy respectively.
Production.
Background.
In November 2015, a few months after the conclusion of the second season, HBO reached an overall deal through 2018 with series creator and executive producer Nic Pizzolatto, that called for him to develop a number of new projects, that could include a third season of "True Detective". Talking about the deal, the president of HBO programming Michael Lombardo stated, "I am thrilled to continue our relationship with Nic, as he is one of the most exceptionally talented writers and producers working today. I look forward to seeing where his unique creative vision will take us next."
In regard to a potential third season, "Variety" reported that the network had requested some changes that included Pizzolatto working with a staff of writers or possibly having a new showrunner. These changes would address the issue of the second season being received less favorably than the first, which was in part attributed to the lack of a creative counterpart to Pizzolatto. In the first season, strong artistic input from Cary Joji Fukunaga, who had directed all eight episodes, is said to have benefited the show. However, with the second season enlisting multiple directors, Pizzolatto had wielded more creative control, conceiving and executing the season on his own. In June 2015, in an interview with "Vanity Fair", Pizzolatto had stated, "If I'm making a movie or a show or whatever, I'm expressing something on a personal level or else it doesn't mean anything to me. If I'm doing that, it works better without a committee."
Development.
In July 2016, Casey Bloys, who had succeeded Lombardo as HBO head of programming two months earlier, confirmed plans for a third season, describing "True Detective" as "a valuable franchise" and revealing that both the network and creator Pizzolatto were open to another season. In March 2017, it was revealed that David Milch had been recruited to assist Pizzolatto in preparing the third season, and that writing the first two episodes had already been completed. In June 2017, "The Tracking Board" reported that Mahershala Ali was in early discussions with HBO to play the lead role of the season. In July 2017, Bloys told reporters at the press tour of the Television Critics Association that Pizzolatto had written the third season almost in its entirety, and added "When we find a director, we'll be a go on that."
On August 31, 2017, after director Jeremy Saulnier was confirmed to work alongside Pizzolatto, HBO officially greenlit the third season of "True Detective". The story was announced to span three decades and take place in the Ozarks, as partner detectives investigate a macabre crime, with Ali in the lead role of state police detective Wayne Hays. Talking about the renewal, Bloys stated: "Nic has written truly remarkable scripts. With his ambitious vision and Mahershala Ali and Jeremy Saulnier aboard, we are excited to embark on the next installment of "True Detective"." Besides Pizzolatto, who also serves as the season's showrunner, other executive producers of the season include Saulnier, Fukunaga, Scott Stephens, season one stars Woody Harrelson and Matthew McConaughey, along with Steve Golin, Bard Dorros, and Richard Brown.
Cast and crew.
Saulnier was expected to direct the first three episodes of the season. However, in March 2018, after he had completed the first two episodes, Saulnier exited the series due to scheduling conflicts, though multiple sources reported "differences of opinion" with Pizzolatto. Daniel Sackheim was announced to replace Saulnier, with the veteran director also being added as an executive producer for the season. Sackheim would divide up directing assignments on the remaining episodes with Pizzolatto, who also serves as the sole writer of the season, except for the episodes four and six, which he co-wrote with David Milch and Graham Gordy respectively.
Following other critically acclaimed actors who had starred in the first two seasons of the series, Academy Award-winner Mahershala Ali plays the lead role of state police detective Wayne Hays. In an interview with "Variety", Ali revealed that he was originally offered a supporting role, as the main character was supposed to be white. However, pursuing a better choice for his career, he convinced Pizzolatto that he was suited for the lead. In November 2017, Carmen Ejogo was announced to star alongside Ali, in the role of schoolteacher Amelia Reardon, and in January 2018, Stephen Dorff was announced to play the co-lead role of partner detective Roland West. Joining them in a series regular role, Ray Fisher plays Wayne Hays' son Henry, while the season also includes a number of recurring roles. In January 2018, The Agency Inc. issued casting calls for up to 1,500 actors, stand-ins and photo-doubles to begin filming in Northwest Arkansas, with the agency's CEO noting, "This is the largest production we've ever cast." Additional casting calls were issued in June 2018 on "Backstage", for Asian talent to portray Vietnamese civilians and soldiers.
Filming.
In February 2018, filming began in Arkansas, with Jeremy Saulnier and Nic Pizzolatto splitting directing assignments. However, Saulnier exited the production early, after he had directed the first two episodes of the season, as it had become clear that filming would take longer than expected to complete. On March 30, 2018, in addition to reports on scheduling conflicts, "Variety" wrote in regard to Saulnier's departure: "Sources said the filming on location in Arkansas has been tough at times, and that Pizzolatto and Saulnier had differences of opinion on the episodes." Saulnier was replaced by veteran director Daniel Sackheim, who would also divide directing assignments on the remaining six episodes with Pizzolatto.
The season was filmed by Random Productions LLC at various locations throughout Northwest Arkansas, including Fayetteville, Bentonville, Lincoln, Rogers and Springdale. Filming took place mainly in Fayetteville, from Mount Sequoyah to homes, apartments and restaurants around the city. Filming on location also included the use of stunts and pyrotechnics in residential areas, namely car explosions, smoke and loud noises. In regard to production on the series taking place in Arkansas, the director of Arkansas Economic Development Commission had stated in December 2017, "This is the largest and most expensive production we've ever had in the state. With an estimated year from start to finish, we know that local businesses and vendors will enjoy a boon from the production."
The season wrapped filming in Fayetteville in August 2018. Talking about their experience, executive producer Scott Stephens said, "Everything we've needed has been right at our fingertips, from period architecture to abandoned buildings that still evoke the 80s," while lead actor Mahershala Ali added that "[the landscape] is such a character in the story. It would have been such a shame if we had shot it any other place." Pizzolatto, who spent four years of his life in Fayetteville as a student at the University of Arkansas, found the area evocative and powerful, and revealed that it was important for him to shoot the season in Arkansas, as this was the place he had in mind when he was writing the episodes.

He was the last commander of the United States Taiwan Defense Command. He retired as a Rear Admiral and is one of the top 25 most decorated American veterans.
Biography.
Linder was born on October 13, 1925 in Osceola, Iowa.
On 11 May 1966, he was awarded the Silver Star for leading the squadron on a strike against a mobile SAM site at Thanh Hóa, North Vietnam. After earning the Navy Cross and Silver Star in combat, he earned a Second, Third, and Fourth Silver Star over a period of three consecutive days.
He was the last Commander of the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command and he oversaw the termination of the official command and closing down of all subordinate commands as well, due to switching of diplomatic relations from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China. In 1979, he served as Special Assistant to the Commander-in-Chief of Pacific Command Admiral Donald C. Davis until his retirement on August 31, 1979.
Later life.
Linder was married to Patricia Joy Weir on June 9, 1949 at Mount Pleasant, Iowa. They had a son and daughter; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. After his retirement from Navy, they settled in Southwestern United States.
Linder died on April 7, 2009 in Oro Valley, Arizona and is buried at Forest Home Cemetery at Mount Pleasant, Iowa.
Awards and Decorations.
Included among his awards for valor and service, in addition to receiving the Navy Cross, Linder was decorated with the Silver Star four times, a Defense Superior Service Medal, four Legions of Merit, seven Distinguished Flying Crosses, a Bronze Star Medal, and twenty four Air Medals.
Navy Cross citation.
For extraordinary heroism in aerial flight on 28 September 1967 as Commander, Carrier Air Wing FIFTEEN, embarked in USS Coral Sea (CVA-43). Commander Linder planned, led, and directed an air-wing striking force consisting of thirty-one aircraft against the heavily defended and strategically important Haiphong railway/highway bridge in North Vietnam. Although subjected to intense and accurate barrages of multi-caliber antiaircraft-artillery fire, surface-to-air missiles, and enemy interceptor aircraft, he fearlessly and skillfully directed and controlled the striking forces assigned, resolutely pressing home a devastating attack with resulted in total destruction of the bridge and marked the culmination of the comprehensive attack plan to isolate the city. As the leader of four of the previous assaults on the strategic Haiphong bridge complex, Commander Linder, by his courageous leadership, comprehensive planning, and outstanding airmanship, contributed greatly to the total success of this daring and expansive attack strategy. Tactics which were planned and executed by Commander Linder encompassed over one hundred and fifty attack sorties and were consummated in the face of scores of accurate surface-to-air missile firings and fusillades of antiaircraft fire concentrated at the targets. Despite the enemy's determined and formidable opposition, the logistic lifeline of Haiphong was effectively severed by the destruction of these key bridges without the loss of a single strike aircraft. Commander Linder's brilliant planning, consummate flight leadership, and fearless devotion to duty in the face of grave personal danger were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Gajda Affair

The Gajda Affair was a series of trials, investigations, rumors, and public commentary from 1926 to 1928 regarding conspiracies against the government of Czechoslovakia allegedly masterminded by Radola Gajda. Gajda was convicted, exonerated, then convicted a second-time on a variety of charges ranging from espionage to mutiny and dismissed from the Czechoslovak Army, though the evidence against him has subsequently come under scrutiny. The Gajda Affair has been said to have demonstrated the ability of the Czechoslovak government to maintain civilian control over the armed forces during a period of heightened political tension in many parts of Europe.
Background.
In 1926 Gen. Radola Gajda, a right-wing Czechoslovak army officer, was given the provisional appointment of chief of the army staff while a new cabinet was being formed following recently concluded elections. In May of that year a military coup in neighboring Poland, press denouncements of Gajda in left-leaning newspapers, and the approach of the Sokol congress – which some felt might be used by Gajda to stage an event similar to Mussolini's March on Rome – combined to create heightened political tension in Czechoslovakia. The general did not publicly dispute the swirling rumors that he was plotting against the government as military regulations prevented him from issuing statements to the media of his own accord; this contributed to the air of uncertainty. Adding to the complexity of the situation, the USSR – which sought to settle an old score with Gajda – began to secretly feed the Czechoslovak government fabricated information that made Gajda appear to be a Soviet agent.
Trials.
On July 2, President of Czechoslovakia Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk placed Gajda on medical leave and ordered an investigation into his activities. In December 1926 a military tribunal concluded Gadja had provided an agent of the USSR secret French war plans six years prior and ordered his dismissal from the army with a 25 percent cut in pension. The veracity of allegations as to Gajda's alleged contacts with Soviet officials have come under scrutiny as he was known to be virulently anti-Communist. Additionally, subsequently declassified correspondence among French officials has revealed their disbelief that Gajda might even have had access to such plans in 1920, during a period where he was posted to Paris on a training mission. 
In 1927 Gajda successfully sued the two witnesses who had testified at his court martial for defamation over the allegations they'd made against him. Encapsulating the intrigue of the time, a United Press story that year reported that "Gajda has been known to Czeho-Slovakians as a national hero, a spy, and a suspicious militarist of German origin".
In response to Gajda's exoneration in civil court, the Czechoslovak government produced new evidence against him in the form of telegrams it claimed to have intercepted and decoded in 1921. It also alleged he had discussed the overthrow of the Czechoslovak government with Josef Šnejdárek. Gajda was ordered to stand trial anew in 1928 and was again convicted on all counts, with his 25 percent loss of pension being reaffirmed. Historian Jonathan Zorach has questioned the conclusion of the second court martial by noting that Šnejdárek and Gajda were not on close terms and Šnejdárek would have been an unusual choice for a confidante for Gajda. Gerald Protheroe has also questioned why the Czechoslovak government, had it intercepted telegrams in 1921, would have waited five years to act upon them.
Aftermath.
In the aftermath of the Gajda Affair, legislation was advanced by the Czechoslovak government to disenfranchise the army officer corps and the gendarmerie as a means of neutralizing the military as a political force. The Gajda Affair has been said to have demonstrated the ultimate ability of the Czechoslovakian civilian government to maintain its supremacy over the armed forces during a fragile period for democracy in many parts of Europe. It also served to splinter the political right among veterans of the Czechoslovak Legion.

Palashi Monument

Palashi Monument is a monument in Palashi (Plassey), Nadia district, in the state of West Bengal. This was erected in memory of the Battle of Plassey fought between Sir Robert Clive, commander of the British East India Company and Nawab Siraj ud-Daulah on 23 June 1757. The monument is under preservation of Archaeological Survey of India. In 2007, on the 250th anniversary of the battle, a statue of Siraj ud-Daulah was established by All India Forward Bloc leader Debabrata Biswas (politician) on behalf of India-Pakistan-Bangladesh People's Forum.
Location.
The monument was established in the bank of the Bhagirathi River and beside Plassey Suger Mill which is popularly known as plassey battlefield. But the actual battlefield has been partially washed away by a shift of the river. The place is located from almost 150 km. from Kolkata and 7 km from the Plassey railway station.

Patel Brothers

Patel Brothers, Inc. (doing business as Patel Brothers) is an Indian-American supermarket chain based in Hanover Park, Illinois. Patel Brothers is the largest Indian-American supermarket chain in the United States with 57 locations in 19 states, primarily in New York and New Jersey, due to its large Indian population. Patel Brothers offers online shopping for the contiguous US through its website, which is fulfilled by its Hanover Park location. The chain was founded by brothers Mafat and Tulsi Patel and is operated by Mafat's sons, Swetal and Rakesh Patel.
History.
Mafat lived in Bhandu, a small village in Gujarat, India, along with his brother, Tulsi before coming to Indiana University for an MBA in 1968. After finishing his business degree, he moved to Chicago to work as an engineer at Jefferson Electrical Co. Mafat found that Indian groceries were expensive and hard to find in Chicago, which inspired him to start a grocery store. The first Patel Brothers store opened on Devon Street in 1974, and was operated jointly by Mafat, Tulsi and his wife Aruna, the latter two of which had immigrated from India to help with the store.
As of 2017, Patel Brothers has grown into a $140 million chain of stores. On Devon Avenue in Chicago, the street that the first restaurant was opened on, there are many different shops that are part of the Patel Brothers chain: Air Tours Inc., a travel agency; Sahil, a clothing boutique meant for Indian weddings (another location in Iselin, NJ); Patel Bros. Handicrafts and Utensils, which sells religious memorabilia and trinkets; and Patel's Café, an eatery; and Mysore Woodlands, a restaurant.
Patel Brothers maintains its trademarks under "PB Brands LLC", which include Dakshin, an Indian restaurant with locations in the Chicago suburbs of Schaumburg and Naperville, Illinois.
Patel Brothers is a family business. The retail chain's day-to-day operations are handled by Mafat's sons Swetal and Rakesh Patel, who also operate the Chicago warehouse in Skokie, Illinois. Mafat and Tulsi Patel still own the original store in Chicago and various trademarks. Tulsi Patel's daughter, Susan Patel owns Patel Bros. Handicrafts and Utensils in Chicago. Mafat's sister's sons Mahendra and Harshad operate the two New York warehouses in Queens. They have strongly built the company in the East Coast. Mafat's nephews Bharat and Jayesh manage the stores in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Texas.
Locations.
Current locations.
After starting out in Chicago, Patel Brothers was a major success with shoppers coming from all over the United States: Wisconsin, Minnesota, Indiana, Michigan, Iowa, and Kansas. The retail chain has spread throughout the United States, mainly the Eastern United States. As of April 2018, the chain had 55 locations, 8 in New Jersey (notably along Oak Tree Road in Edison and Iselin, which has three locations), 6 in Texas, 4 in New York, Florida, and Illinois each, and the rest are spread throughout the eastern United States with only two locations in the western United States: one store in Santa Clara near San Jose, California, and a second in Chandler, Arizona, near Phoenix. Patel Brothers are generally located in retail parks along with other stores and restaurants. The largest store is located in Naperville, Illinois, which includes a restaurant called "Patel's Fresh Kitchen". The Naperville and Parlin, New Jersey are built using modern architecture. 
The Patel Brothers locations include: 
The locations in Iselin, New Jersey east of the Garden State Parkway, Jersey City, New Jersey, North Brunswick, New Jersey and Ridgeland, Mississippi operate under the cash and carry concept. Several Patel Brothers locations including the McKinney, Texas; Naperville, Illinois; and Monroeville, Pennsylvania stores have green and yellow auto rickshaws near the store to maintain India's cultural identity in America. Some locations go by names other than Patel Brothers: the Ridgeland, Mississippi store operates under the name Patel Grocery and the Manchester, Connecticut store operates under the name Patel Foods. Patel Brothers is not affiliated with the gas station called Patel's Grocery in Homer, Georgia, Shah and Patel Indian Burmese grocery store in Rockville, Maryland, or Patel Foods Indo-Pak grocery store in Overland Park, Kansas. The reason why many Indian grocery stores have similar names to Patel Brothers is that PB Brands, LLC only has trademarks for the names "Patel Brothers", "Patel's", and "Patel's Cash and Carry".
There are Patel Brothers locations on Devon Avenue's Desi Street in Chicago, 
Mahatma Gandhi District in Houston, India Square in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Patel Plaza (retail park leased by Patel Brothers) in Decatur, Georgia, where they are located in ethnic enclaves known as Little India, next to many other Indian restaurants and stores.
Former locations.
Previously in Canada, Patel Brothers used to operate 3 stores in the Greater Toronto Area in Scarborough, Etobicoke, and Mississauga, which are now operated by Canada-based Panchvati Supermarket, and a store in Sugar Land in Greater Houston.
Brands and products.
After Mafat and Tulsi Patel started their career as grocers they changed gears toward prepackaged ethnic foods. In 1991, they introduced a variety of authentic foods under the umbrella of Raja Foods LLC, which supplies for 60% of Patel Brothers products. Raja Foods LLC operates under seven brands, three of which are Patel Brothers original brands:
Raja Foods LLC has 5 warehouses:
Patel Brothers sells South Asian cuisine including Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi food products. Their products include beverages, canned and packaged goods, condiments, ghee and oil, grains, health and beauty products, instant mix, kitchen products, lentils and beans, ready to eat food, Indian snacks, South Asian sweets, spices, spice blends, and spiritual items.
Popular culture.
In December 2017, Patel Brothers co-founder Mafat Patel was featured in Zee TV's "Those Who Made It" Season Finale.

Plogging

Plogging is a combination of jogging with picking up litter (merging the Swedish verbs (pick up) and (jog) gives the new Swedish verb , from which the word plogging derives). It started as an organized activity in Sweden around 2016 and spread to other countries in 2018, following increased concern about plastic pollution. As a workout, it provides variation in body movements by adding bending, squatting and stretching to the main action of running, hiking, or walking. An estimated 2,000,000 people Plog daily in 100 countries and some plogging events have attracted over 3,000,000 participants.
Examples and initiatives.
Erik Ahlström started plogging in the Swedish capital city, Stockholm, when he moved there from the Åre ski resort. He created the website Plogga to organise the activity and encourage volunteers.
In Alicante, Spain, plogging came with the name "Plogging RRevolution" with the aim of spreading the movement throughout the country to promote sports and environmental care.
Author David Sedaris combines litter picking with exercise in the Parham, Coldwaltham and Storrington districts of West Sussex, taking up to 60,000 steps a day in pursuit of local rubbish. He was so effective in keeping his neighbourhood clean that the local authority named a waste vehicle in his honour. The Lord Lieutenant of West Sussex, Susan Pyper, said "The sign on this truck is a very fitting way to say a huge 'thank you' to David for his tireless efforts ... he is a real local hero."
The Keep America Beautiful organisation is now promoting plogging to its affiliates and has found that some already combined exercise with clean up, such as the "Trashercize" program in Tennessee. In New York, a Meetup group, "Plogging NYC", had about 100 members in 2018, with events in four boroughs. In Indianapolis in 2018, a Summer of Plogging was organised by the November Project and the local affiliate of Keep America Beautiful.
National Cleanup Day advocates plogging as a way to clean up and keep the outdoors clean and maintains the website Plogging.org in support of organizations holding plogging events.
There is a group in Oakland, California, called Fit4Good that aims to pick up trash around Lake Merritt each week.
Ripu Daman Bevli, introduced the concept of plogging in India and he is known as the Plogman of India. He commenced "Litter Free India movement", which combines Swachh Bharat and FIT India missions. Till March 2021, Bevli has organized more than 500 cleanups across 80 cities under the Litter Free India movement, which has seen a participation of close to 1 crore (10 million) people. The Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has plogged to lead by example for his Swachh Bharat Mission to clean up India.
"Pune Ploggers" founded by Vivek Gurav is the largest community of ploggers in a single city with more than 500 routine ploggers throughout Pune, and has collected more than 40,000 kilograms of plastic. In December 2019 the organization coordinated the largest plogging drive, with 105,000 people involved who collected 19,000 kilograms of trash in one hour.
A non-profit initiative called Go Plog! has collected 16 Tonnes of dry waste in Kolar through plogging. They organise an event every month. Students to high-ranking officials of the local administration participate.

Operation Bolling

Operation Bolling was a search and destroy and security operation conducted during the Vietnam War by the U.S. 503rd Infantry Regiment in Phú Yên Province, South Vietnam from 19 September 1967 to 31 January 1969.
Background.
Following the completion of Operation Greeley, in September 1967 General William B. Rosson instructed the commander of the 173rd Airborne Brigade, Brigadier General Leo H. Schweiter, to locate and destroy the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 95th Regiment, which was believed to be located in a base area known as “The Hub” in the foothills northwest of Tuy Hòa in Phú Yên Province. When the Battle of Dak To intensified in early November, the 173rd Airborne Brigade was called back to the Đắk Tô area and responsibility for the operation fell to the newly-arrived 3rd Battalion, 503rd Infantry Regiment.
Operation.
The operation began uneventfully and in mid-December following the end of the Battle of Dak To, the Brigade headquarters and the 4th Battalion, 503rd Infantry, returned to join the operation.
In late December after Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces had been ambushed in the Ky Lo Valley, 45 kilometers northwest of Tuy Hòa, the commander of the 3/503rd Lt. Col. John R. D. Cleland landed a scout platoon there on 27 December. The platoon came under heavy fire after landing and Lt. Col. Cleland landed the remainder of his battalion in the area to engage the PAVN force. Company A landed near the hamlet of Xom Dap, 2km south of the initial contact area in a 200m by 50m landing zone surrounded by hedges and trees. PAVN forces in bunkers around the landing zone opened fire on the Company as soon as they touched down, killing or wounding numerous Americans and destroying one helicopter. Company A fought back and gradually began to destroy the PAVN bunkers. At approximately 15:30 the PAVN broke contact when a company from 4/503rd Infantry was landed nearby. 62 PAVN were killed for the loss of 12 Americans killed. 
Operational results to the end of December were 693 PAVN/VC killed and 228 individual and 19 crew-served weapons captured. U.S. losses were 67 killed.
Aftermath.
The operation continued until 31 January 1969. US sources claim that PAVN losses in the operation were in excess of 693 killed and 59 captured. 103 PAVN structures and 177 bunkers were destroyed, but a further 4,000 civilian structures were also destroyed, displacing about 20,000 civilians.

Abdul Minty

Abdul Minty (otherwise known as Abdul Samad Minty) (born 31 October 1939) is a South African diplomat. He is currently ambassador of his country to the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). He was a candidate for the succession of Mohammed ElBaradei as Director-General of the IAEA.
Early life.
Minty was born in Hartebeesfontein, South Africa. He grew up in Johannesburg but left the country for the UK in 1958.
Working against apartheid.
Minty presented the IOC 1962 material on racism in South African sports, which led in 1963 to exclude South Africa from the Olympic Games. Following his studies, he was a researcher at the Richardson Institute for Conflict and Peace Research in London from 1969 to 1975.
In 1979 he went to Norway to lead the "World Campaign against Military and Nuclear Cooperation with South Africa" in Oslo. This initiative was committed to respecting the 1977 arms embargo against South Africa and South Africa's (then only suspected) nuclear weapons program. Minty repeatedly raised these questions in the UN committees, such as the Special Committee against Apartheid, or the OAU . He was also a researcher at the International Peace Research Institute in Oslo during this time.
After apartheid.
Minty returned to South Africa in 1995. His experience and contacts were in demand in post-apartheid South Africa . He was Deputy Director-General of the South African Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Chairman of the WMD Non-Proliferation Council, which is responsible for export control of nuclear materials.
In 1995, he was also South Africa's ambassador to the IAEA Board of Governors in Vienna. Minty was committed to global nuclear disarmament, but also to the spread of peaceful nuclear technologies. In November 2008, South Africa's Minister of Mining and Energy, Patience, announced Sonjica Minty's candidacy for succeeding Mohammed el-Baradei, whose term ended on November 30, 2009, as IAEA Director-General. His candidacy was supported primarily by developing and emerging countries. After a first attempt to the election in March 2009 brought no decision, the Japanese Yukiya Amano prevailed on 2 July 2009 against Minty, when he reached the necessary two-thirds majority in the fourth ballot.

And the Walls Came Tumbling Down

And the Walls Came Tumbling Down is a 1989 autobiography written by civil rights leader Ralph David Abernathy. The book charts his life and work with his best friend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in their leadership of the Civil Rights Movement to help African Americans obtain equal rights with white Americans. His book engendered much controversy due to Abernathy's allegations of King's infidelity the night before he was assassinated.
Background.
Ralph Abernathy was a leader of the civil rights movement, along with Martin Luther King Jr., whom he met in 1954; they eventually became close friends . Abernathy collaborated with King on many successful nonviolent movements. Including their creation of the Montgomery Improvement Association, which led to the Montgomery bus boycott. The King and Abernathy partnership spearheaded movements as well in Albany, Georgia; Birmingham, Alabama; Mississippi; Washington, D.C.; Selma, Alabama; St. Augustine, Florida; Chicago; Memphis, and other cities. King and Abernathy shared a close relationship in their participation in the movement, sometimes sharing the same hotel rooms and leisure time with family and friends. Their relationship was so strong that they would dine together frequently, and each other's children called the other "Uncle". They were jailed a total of 17 times together for their involvement in the movement.
After King's assassination, Abernathy assumed control of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and continued to lead movements that he and King had discussed as well as other anti-segregation movements around the Capital Beltway. Abernathy's reasons for writing the book have been questioned; the book has been described as a biography of King as much as it is an autobiography of Abernathy.
As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about. It's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you, and Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world. — Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., during his last speech ever delivered "I've Been to the Mountaintop" 
Synopsis.
Abernathy relates the story of his close relationship with King. The book begins with details of his participation in the Montgomery bus boycott. He details how he was surprised to hear King's selection as leader of the Montgomery Improvement Association (MIA), but stated that he wished he had nominated him for the role himself. The autobiography details how he was elected program organizer, which made him the chief organizer of activities for the group. Abernathy states how this working relationship worked well as it split most of the responsibilities of the MIA between himself and King.
There are some details of Abernathy which do not match up with accounts made by King himself about the closeness of their relationship, but Abernathy asserts a very close relationship in the book, stating he and King "tried to meet for dinner every day" during the Montgomery boycott. The overall narrative paints an intertwined life between Abernathy and King. It details how King found Abernathy at an Atlanta church, and how the two became close friends and co-activists.
The duo of Abernathy and King is described as being extremely well-known wherever they went together. Abernathy describes how women would bring food to them to thank them for their efforts in their communities. The two frequently shared the same jail cell together during their many arrests for their protest actions. The two are described as so inseparable that Bull Connor, the elected Commissioner of Public Safety for the city of Birmingham, Alabama, termed them the "Gold Dust Twins" and required that both be put in solitary confinement as he said, "These two have never been separate...". It was during this separation that King wrote the famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail" on April 16, 1963.
In the book Abernathy recounts King's declining health during the movement in Selma in 1965. He describes how after a meeting with President Johnson, King had to be rushed to a hospital. Abernathy stated that this was a recurring stomach illness that plagued King during the entire course of their movement.
In the book he also notably revealed King's marital infidelity, claiming that King had sexual relations with two women on the night of April 3, 1968 (after his "I've Been to the Mountaintop" speech that day), the night before he was assassinated.
Abernathy also explains his controversial endorsement of Ronald Reagan for president, but contrasts this with details of his frustrating efforts to collaborate with the Reagan administration after the election. He also detailed his thoughts on the status of the leadership of the civil rights movement in America, including discrediting Jesse Jackson among other prominent black leaders at the time.
Controversy.
The book's revelations became the source of much controversy, as did Abernathy. Jesse Jackson and other civil rights activists made a statement in October 1989—after the book's release—that the book was "slander" and that "brain surgery" must have altered Abernathy's perception. Jackson, Andrew Young, and more than two dozen other prominent black leaders held a press conference at King's graveside to condemn Abernathy's allegations. A review in the "Chicago Tribune" stated of the book: "Here is a man at pains to paint himself as closer than a brother to King: his confidant, alter-ego and most trusted adviser. And then he proves his closeness by betraying the confidence."

Luise F. Pusch

Luise F. Pusch (born 14 January 1944 in Gütersloh, Germany) is a German linguist. She is regarded as the co-founder of feminist linguistics in Germany, along with Senta Trömel-Plötz.
Life and education.
Luise Pusch studied English, Latin and linguistics at the University of Hamburg. In 1972 she received her doctorate in English. In 1978, she qualified for the linguistics faculty at the University of Konstanz. From 1979 to 1984 she was a Heisenberg Fellow in the field of feminist linguistic research. Before feminist linguistics became her specialty, she worked on syntactic issues such as construction of gerunds. From 1982 to 1985 she held professorships in English and German in Leibniz University Hannover and in the University of Duisburg-Essen. In 1985, she was named adjunct professor at the University of Konstanz. In 1990-1991, she was professor for women's studies at the University of Münster. Since 1986, Pusch has been partnered with U.S. Germanist Joey Horsley from Boston, and splits her time between there and Hannover.
Career.
In the mid-1970s, U.S. feminists such as Robin Lakoff and others had begun to pay attention to the gender discrimination inherent in the language itself, and the way it was used. Feminist linguistics didn't originally develop out of the academic linguistic discipline, but from theoreticians within oppressed groups. From those beginnings, it was brought into the field of linguistics by two professors of linguistics, Senta Trömel-Plötz and Pusch who started the program of Feminist linguistics at the University of Konstanz. The first essays to appear in Germany about the topic were in 1979 in the journal "Osnabrücker Beiträge zur Sprachtheorie", and in 1980 in "Linguistische Berichte."
Since the 1970s Pusch has been committed to a "gender-appropriate language", for example in essays, commentary, discussions, lectures and workshops.
In her 1980 essay, "German as Men's Language: Diagnosis and Therapy Ideas" ("Das Deutsche als Männersprache. Diagnose und Therapievorschläge") , she wrote that standard German has a built-in bias favoring males, that this is problematic, and that the simplest solution to the problem lies in partial de-genderization of the language. To that end, the feminine suffixes "-in" and "-innen" could be done away with; female professors would become, simply, ""Professor" (instead of "Professorin") or "Schriftsteller"" (writer) instead of "Schriftstellerin."
Due to the expected non-acceptance of such a proposal, she pleaded for the stepped up use of "Binnen-I" (e.g., "SchülerIn" (schoolchild) ) in order to avoid use of the paired-word form, "Schülerinnen und Schüler" (schoolgirls and schoolboys). Besides her linguistic work, she built a biographical database containing the biographies of 30,000 women.
In 1981 she wrote the autobiographical novel "Sonja: eine Melancholie für Fortgeschrittene" (″Sonja: Melancholia for Intermediates″) about her suicidal partner under the pseudonym Judith Offenbach.
Awards.
The association "", a network of women in the book industry, chose Luise F. Pusch as "BookWoman of the Year" 2004. On her 70th Birthday, Pusch was honored with the commemorative "Sprachwandlerin" award. The Darmstadt-based Luise Büchner Society awarded Pusch their 5th Luise Büchner Prize for Media studies in November 2016.

Concerto Piccolo

Concerto Piccolo is a live album by European jazz group the Vienna Art Orchestra recorded at the Zürich Jazz Festival in 1980 and released on the Hat ART label.
Reception.
The Allmusic review stated: "Recorded live at the Zurich Jazz Festival in 1980, this was America's first taste of the wild abandon that is the Vienna Art Orchestra and expatriate Lauren Newton's glorious vocal instrument. This is a 13-piece big band led by the beautifully weird compositional, instructional, and arranging craziness of Mathias Rüegg. They trash and revere all traditions -- both historical and avant-garde at the same time -- while using them both along with carnival and circus music, classical forms and fugues, and French salon music. ... There are colors, harmonies, and polyphonal systems at work here that will be recalled as the glory years of Euro big-band jazz in the future, and the evocative timbral nature of Rüegg's compositions will be studied for decades to come. Truly, "Concerto Piccolo" is an amazing debut from a band that offers more than it could possibly receive".

Collective worship in schools

Section 70 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 stipulates that pupils of community, foundation or voluntary schools in England and Wales must take part in a daily act of Collective Worship, unless they have been explicitly withdrawn by their parents. The same requirement is applied to academy schools via their funding agreements, so it is true to say that "all" maintained schools in England and Wales are subject to the same rules. However, in practice there is widespread non-compliance with the legislation, which has not been monitored by Ofsted since 2004.
The responsibility for ensuring that the rules are applied rests with a school's head teacher, its governing body and the Local Education Authority. Local Education Authorities normally exercise this function via a Standing Advisory Council for Religious Education (SACRE).
Definition &amp; Aims of Collective Worship.
Guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) defines worship in this context as "reverence or veneration paid to a divine being or power." It makes a distinction between the terms "collective worship" and "corporate worship", with the latter being worship amongst a group with beliefs in common.
It also describes the aims of the legislation as follows: "Collective worship in schools should aim to provide the opportunity for pupils to worship God, to consider spiritual and moral issues and to explore their own beliefs; to encourage participation and response, whether through active involvement in the presentation of worship or through listening to and joining in the worship offered; and to develop community spirit, promote a common ethos and shared values, and reinforce positive attitudes."
Required Attributes of Collective Worship.
The nature of the required daily act of collective worship in England and Wales is set out in Schedule 20 of the School Standards and Framework Act. This defines collective worship as "a single act of worship for all pupils" or separate acts of worship for groups of pupils. It should normally take place on school premises. The nature of the acts of worship should take into account the ages, aptitudes and family backgrounds of the pupils. 
Schools with a formal faith designation are required to arrange worship in accordance with their trust deed or, if they have no trust deed, in line with the practices of their designated faith. For schools "without" a formal faith designation, the majority of the acts of worship should be "of a broadly Christian character". In practical terms, this has been interpreted to mean that 51% of school days each school term must have an act of worship of a broadly Christian character.
The legislation is supplemented by non-statutory DfE guidance. This makes it clear that sixth-formers can decide for themselves whether or not to take part in collective worship. It also sets out circumstances under which a local SACRE can grant a formal determination that an individual school can provide alternatives to the "broadly Christian" collective worship arrangements required by the legislation.
While head teachers have a duty to ensure that the law on collective worship is upheld within their school, they cannot themselves be required to participate in it, or to direct other teachers to participate it, against their will. Nor can they make the willingness to participate in, or lead, collective worship a condition of teachers' employment. If necessary, head teachers are required to source "appropriate people
from the local community who would be willing and able to lead collective worship".
Compliance with, and Challenges to, the Law on Collective Worship.
When the head of Ofsted announced that it would no longer inspect the provision of Collective Worship in 2004, he stated that 76% of secondary schools were not compliant with the law. An opinion poll commissioned by the BBC in 2011 indicated that 64% of parents in England say their children do not attend a daily act of worship at school, and that 60% of the general public are not in favour of the law on collective worship being enforced.
In 2011, amendments were proposed to the law on collective worship, which would have made it optional at schools without a formal faith designation, and which would have also made it easier for pupils to opt themselves out of collective worship. The amendments were debated in the House of Lords, but were not adopted.
Nigel Genders, the Church of England's Chief Education Officer stated that:
Philosopher James K. A. Smith holds that daily collective worship imparts what an educational institution values and has an impact on human formation; because the United Kingdom's national identity and ethics "are fundamentally rooted in Christianity", there is no reason why collective worship should be discontinued. Elizabeth Oldfield, the director of the Theos Think Tank, has opined that scrubbing religion from the public square is far from neutral. The Catholic Education Service teaches that:
Groups campaigning to amend the law on Collective Worship include Humanists UK and the National Secular Society, who argue that the requirement for daily worship should be replaced by a requirement for inclusive assemblies instead. The National Governors Association is also seeking an end to compulsory collective worship in schools without a religious affiliation. In 2014 a leading education spokesperson for the Church of England, Bishop Pritchard, publicly expressed a view that the term collective worship should be re-framed as "spiritual reflection" to make it, in his eyes, "more honest, and more in tune with contemporary culture." The Liberal Democrats have adopted a policy to make collective worship in non-religious schools optional rather than compulsory, and a change in the law has also been called for by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. In 2016, the Committee on the Rights of the Child called for an end to compulsory collective worship in UK schools.
Christian nationalists see the call by some to remove collective worship in schools as "the next step in the ongoing erosion of our Christian heritage" and state that "Christian collective worship should stay because we are a Christian nation."
History of the Law on Collective Worship.
The law on compulsory collective worship was first introduced by Section 25 of the 1944 Education Act. The legislation was subsequently developed by the Education Reform Act 1988, by Chapter III of the Education Act 1996, and, most recently, by the School Standards and Framework Act 1998.
Collective Worship in other parts of the UK (Scotland and Northern Ireland).
Collective worship is also a daily legal requirement in Northern Ireland, although regulations on the nature of the worship are different to that of England and Wales. 
In Scotland there is no requirement for collective worship, but the practice of religious observance should be available to pupils, unless the local education authority has resolved to discontinue it and this resolution has been approved by local electors.

Killing of Raju Risaldar

Raju Risaldar, labelled the don of Vadodara (alt.: Baroda) by the media, was killed by police in an encounter (also referred to as the "Vadodara encounter") in June 1993. Raju was accused of being involved in multiple cases of extortion, murder and contract killing. He was also a political activist of Shiv Sena and its chief of Vadodara district unit. Risalder rose to prominence following the August 1991 killing of a Congress Party leader.
In February 1993, Chief Minister Chimanbhai Patel was credited with strong-arming Risalder into an uneasy alliance to keep the peace between Hindu and Muslim communal activists in Baroda in the lead up to an election in which the BJP was expected to contest the traditional Congress Party dominance of elections in the region by issuing orders to have several of Risalder's lieutenants arrested. Risalder and "Shiv Sena" were then tasked with ensuring that the BJP turnout would be low. According to "The Times of India", leaders of the Hindu community cooperated out of a desire to avert the communal rioting and destruction of shops and other property that were expected if Congress lost the election.
Risalder's henchmen were accused of murdering of Dinesh Pathak, the resident editor of the popular Gujarati daily "Sandesh". Raju was arrested in Bombay and was shot dead by Gujarat Police in Vadodara.

Hide discography

The following is the discography of hide, a Japanese rock musician who first gained fame in the late 1980s as lead guitarist of the heavy metal band X Japan before starting his solo career in 1993. Prior to X Japan, hide was leader and guitarist of the heavy metal band Saber Tiger (later known as Sa"v"er Tiger), who released one self-titled EP in July 1985 and contributed to two omnibuses before ending activities. Although two compilation albums of demos and live recordings and one concert VHS would later be released in 2001, with the band credited as Yokosuka Saver Tiger.
hide made his solo debut in August 1993 on MCA Victor with the simultaneously released singles "Eyes Love You" and "50% &amp; 50%", which were both certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ). Although the lyrics to these two songs were written by Yukinojo Mori, all of his subsequent material was written and composed by hide himself. His first studio album, "Hide Your Face", was released in early 1994, reached number nine on the Oricon chart, and was certified double platinum by the RIAJ. All vocals and guitars were performed by hide, while bass and drums were contributed by various musicians such as T. M. Stevens and Terry Bozzio.
In September 1996, hide released his second studio album, "Psyence", which debuted at number one on the Oricon and was also certified double platinum by the RIAJ. It features many fewer musicians than his previous album, as hide began to also contribute almost all bass parts. With the January 1998 single "Rocket Dive", his first on Universal Victor, his solo work started being released under the moniker hide with Spread Beaver, crediting his live touring band. However, with the exception of programmer, recording engineer and co-producer I.N.A and drummer Joe, the Spread Beaver members' contributions to recorded material was limited.
hide died on May 2, 1998 of what was ruled a suicide by hanging. Eleven days later, the single "Pink Spider" was released, debuted at number one and became his first release to be certified million by the RIAJ. Later that same month, it was succeeded as number one on the Oricon by its followup, "Ever Free", which was certified double platinum. "3.2.1.", the debut studio album by Zilch, a United States-based band which formed in 1996 and was fronted by hide, was released in July 1998 by Cutting Edge. It reached number 2 on the Oricon and was certified double platinum by the RIAJ. The only studio album credited to hide with Spread Beaver, "Ja, Zoo", was incomplete at the time of hide's death. It was completed by I.N.A and the other members of Spread Beaver, released in November 1998, reached number two and has been certified triple platinum for sales over 1.2 million.
In the years since hide's death, numerous re-releases, compilations and previously unreleased material has been published posthumously, including the 2002 single "In Motion" and the 2014 song "Co Gal". Both of these were demos or unfinished songs that were completed by I.N.A, with the later utilizing Vocaloid technology to mimic hide's voice. hide's solo recordings have sold over 6.6 million copies.

STM Sports F.C.

STM Sports Association Football Club was a Welsh football club. They were based in St Mellons, Cardiff and played at Cardiff University Sports fields.
History.
Regional leagues.
The club was formed mostly from players of the Cardiff Cosmos Portos, coupled with players from Sunday League side Willows FC. They played originally in the Cardiff Combination League, before moving to the South Wales Amateur League for the 2010–11 season where they were crowned Division Two champions at their first attempt. The following season in Division One saw the club finish seventh position, whilst the following year saw them finished in fifth position and also saw them win the South Wales FA Senior Cup.
The 2013–14 season saw them finished fourth place, with promotion to the Welsh Football League obtained at the end of 2014–15 season, finishing as Champions. The club had to lodge an appeal with the Football Association of Wales to secure promotion and then defeated Pontlottyn 4–1 at Cardiff City Stadium in the SWFA promotion play-off. The match also featured the unusual situation of one of the club's players being arrested during the match by police officers for an outstanding charge of assault and failing to answer to court.
Welsh Football League.
In the first season in Division Three, the club finished in fourth place before improving on that for the 2016–17 season, finishing second to Llantwit Major and gaining promotion to Division Two. In their first season in Division Two the club finished in fourth place, before being crowned champions in the 2018–19 season. The season included a record 20–0 Welsh League Cup away win over Caerau which saw five STM Sports players score hat-tricks.
The team also reached the semi-final of the FAW Trophy before losing in extra time to Cefn Albion in a match that was marred by claims of racism against two STM Sports players by supporters of Cefn Albion. Both clubs were later charged by FA Wales in relation to potential offences in relation to the match.
Cymru South.
As Division Two champions, the club was eligible for promotion to the newly established Cymru South. The club was informed by the Football Association of Wales (FAW) in May 2019 that they had not been awarded tier 2 certification to be eligible to play at that level, and were given the right of appeal. The club won their appeal later in May. In the first season in tier 2, the club's season was curtailed by the COVID-19 pandemic which led to the suspension of all football in Wales and curtailment of the season. The club finished in sixth position after a decision was made to determine final places on a points per game (PPG) basis by the FAW.
At the end of the season, the club was informed by the Football Association of Wales that they had not been successful in gaining a tier 2 domestic licence for the forthcoming season. Despite appealing this decision, the club lost their appeal, and were therefore told they must compete in the newly established tier 3 structure for 2020–21. The club were placed in the new Ardal Leagues South West when it was announced in July 2020.
Closure of the club.
On 27 July 2020 it was announced that the club would not play in the 2020–21 season, and would dissolve.

Razmnamah (British Library, Or. 12076)

The Razmnama, British Library Or.12076 is an incomplete illustrated Mughal manuscript of the "Razmnama", which is a translation of the Hindu epic "Mahabharata" written by Naqib Khan, and copied in AH 1007 (1598/99). It contains sections 14–18, the concluding part of the work, with some detached parts. There are 24 full-page Mughal paintings of high quality, all attributed to artists (two artists in three cases). It is the second of the four surviving Mughal illustrated manuscripts, described in the BL catalogue as "Sub-imperial Mughal".
British Library ("BL"), Or. 12076 has 138 folios which were already numbered when bought, the numbers running from 715 to 846, with others not numbered, but several leaves missing from the text.
History.
The manuscript appeared in an auction at Sotheby's in London in 1921 (24-25 Oct. 1921, lot 203), when the BL portion was bought for £76 by the art historian Gerald Reitlinger (then only 21). It appeared again at Sotheby's in 1954 (Lot 230, Sotheby's sale 8 Nov. 1954), and was bought by a dealer who sold it to the British Museum (now BL) a few weeks later.
In the 1921 sale, several lots included parts of the manuscript, which had presumably recently been divided for the sale, and altogether the locations of 161 miniatures are known, and were recorded by Seyller. The location of the "remaining portions" of the text, sold to a dealer for £1, are not known. A further eight leaves later reached the BL as British Library Add.Or. 2776–2783.
British Library, Or. 12076 has only the last five sections (Parwa) of 18 in the whole work. The text follows the Jaimini version of Ashvamedhika Parva.

Bhima also went to Dwarka to invite Krishna, and also tell Anusalwa who tried to abduct the white horse but was defeated by Vrishakethu. The Jaimini version tells many adventures of white horse. First the horse reaches Malwa where Arjuna fights and defeats King Niladhwaja. Then the horse stuck in a rock in the Vindhya Range and the sage Saubhari tells the story of Chandi.
Next the horse reaches the city of King Hansadhwaja. Arjuna with the help of Krishna kills Hansadhwaja's son Sudhanva and Suratha. Then the horse reaches Manipura where Arjuna's son Babruvahana kills Arjuna. Here Jaimini tells the story of Rama who fights with his own son Lava-kusha. But later Arjuna is save by a magical gem.

Sylvie Brunet

Sylvie Brunet is a contemporary French opera singer (mezzo-soprano).
Biography.
Born to a Sicilian father and a French mother, Brunet was hired to sing the title role of Verdi's "Aida" in Bercy, one of her first professional engagements.
She moved towards the "Falcon" mezzo-soprano repertoire, a type of voice that is not very frequent. She has performed on several international stages and takes part in recordings, notably at Sony, Dynamic and EMI.
Brunet performed Gluck's "Iphigénie en Tauride" at La Scala of Milan, under the baton of Riccardo Muti, "Samson and Delilah" at the Teatro Regio of Turin, the title-role of "Carmen" at the Zürich Opera House, the role of Suzuki in "Madame Butterfly" at the Paris Opera directed by Bob Wilson, Madame de Croissy in "Dialogues des Carmélites" at the Paris Opera and the Zürich Opera, Santuzza in "Cavalleria Rusticana" at the Séville Opera, Marguerite in "La Damnation de Faust" in Zürich and eventually the title role in Meyerbeer's "l'Africaine" at the Opéra national du Rhin.
Noticed by Sergio Segalini, she is invited to sing Azucena in Verdi's "Il trovatore" at the Martina Franca Festival. On this occasion, an Italian critic wrote of her: "Verdi has finally found her Azucena, Sylvie Brunet is currently one of the rare Verdian singers, as much for her dramatic potential as for the breadth of her voice".
Sylvie Brunet collaborates with the French conductor Marc Minkowski who invites her to sing the title role of "Carmen" in Paris and Grenoble as well as for productions of "l’Incoronazione di Poppea" at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and Vienna directed by Klaus Michael Gruber, and "The Tales of Hoffmann" at the Lausanne Opera.
Sylvie Brunet has sung in concert, among others Verdi's "Requiem" at Monte-Carlo under the direction of Georges Prêtre, Beethoven's "Symphony No. 9" with the Orchestre National de France under the direction of Kurt Masur as well as the cantata "" by Lili Boulanger with the Orchestre philharmonique de Radio France and the Berliner Philharmonie.

Neil Swallow

James Neil Swallow (1931 – 29 April 2010) was a pioneering British dentist who developed treatments for adults and children with mental and physical disabilities. He co-authored a standard textbook on children's dentistry. In 1964, Swallow became senior lecturer in children's dentistry at the Cardiff Dental School. This was followed in 1975 by his appointment as professor of paediatric dentistry at the University of Amsterdam, and then as professor of restorative dentistry at Belfast Dental School in 1978.
Early life.
Swallow was born in Taunton, England, in 1931. He obtained his Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree from the London Hospital in 1955.
Career.
Swallow founded clinics for children with disabilities at Dr Barnardo's Home and the London Hospital, during a period in which there was little interest in the oral health of disabled people. He frequently made night calls to construct feeding plates for new-born children with cleft palates.
Along with Geoffrey Slack and Phil Holloway, he authored "Child Dental Health" (1969) which for many years was a standard textbook on children's dentistry and well-remembered by dental students from his time. In addition, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he would visit the Bobaths at their centre in London for children with cerebral palsy. In 1964, Swallow was awarded the A.A.E. Newth Prize by the Society of Medical Officers of Health.
He moved to Cardiff in 1964, where he had been appointed as the first senior lecturer in children's dentistry at the then new Cardiff Dental School. He set up a course in paediatric dentistry and developed a dental service for children and adults with a disability. His MD thesis on the oral health of people with disability was published in 1967. Swallow carried on treating children and adults with disabilities when he became professor of paediatric dentistry at the University of Amsterdam in 1975. In 1978, he was appointed professor of restorative dentistry at the Belfast Dental School, where he remained until 1983. When he returned from Belfast, he started a dental practice at home with his second wife Barbara.
Death and legacy.
Swallow died on 29 April 2010. He received obituaries in the "Journal of Disability and Oral Health" and the "British Dental Journal". His wife, Barbara, later talked about his work in a witness seminar.

Javanshir Fortress

Javanshir Fortress is a defensive fortress located 4 km north of the village of Talystan in the Ismayilli region, on the right bank of Aghcachay. The castle was built by the ruler Javanshir during the reign of Mehranids dynasty in the Caucasus Albania. The fortress is named after him. It is believed that the fortress was used as an administrative center.
Structure.
The fortress was constructed of lime and river stones. The area of the fortress is about 1.5 – 2 hectares. It consists of a fortress and an inner fortress called Naringala. It is surrounded by the valley of the Agchay river from three sides. The complex consists of the main part and Ichgala. The polygonal-shaped Ichgala was built on the highest point of the mountain. In most places only the basis of it remains. The walls of the Ichgala are demolished. The thickness of the southern wall of the main portion is 2 meters and its height is more than 10 meters. The western walls were completely destroyed by landslides. The defense complex includes 6 towers and their height are up to 8 meters. At the northern end of the tower there is a wall with a width of 2 meters and a ledge length of 50 meters. The wall is completed with a cylinder-shaped tower. The entrance to the castle was only from the southern side. There was a gate place with 2.5 m width. There were comb-shaped merlons about 0.5 m from each other on top of the walls. Tower was built to strengthen the walls of the castle. Ichgala is in the northern part of the fortress. Towers are four-cornered on the south, and rounded on other sides. Some of their diameters reach 8 meters. The main surveillance point is located at the northern end of the fortress. There used to be a hidden path on the north-eastern side of the fortress. This gave the opportunity to the fortress to communicate with the outside during a blockade.
The exact scheme of it was first compiled by Professor, Doctor of Geographical Sciences, Ramazan Tarverdiyev in 1963.

Genesis 2.0

Genesis 2.0 is a documentary film made by Swiss director and producer Christian Frei and Russian filmmaker Maxim Abugaev. The feature-length film was released in January 2018 in the World Cinema Documentary section at the Sundance Film Festival. At the center of the film is the woolly mammoth, an extinct and iconic species that today is surrounded by wishes and visions. On the one hand, the film documents the hazardous daily lives of a group of men who gather valuable mammoth tusks in a remote archipelago, the New Siberian Islands. On the other, it illuminates the potential of genetic research and synthetic biology — the means by which researchers hope to bring the woolly mammoth back to life.
Synopsis.
Year after year, the "mammoth hunters" set out on a dangerous journey to the remote New Siberian Islands in the far north of Siberia. They dig into the earth in search of the tusks of extinct mammoths — precious ivory that they can sell for huge sums of money. Because the permafrost is thawing, entire mammoth carcasses are also coming to light, and scientists are showing great interest in these finds. Cloning researchers and molecular biologists are working with a variety of methods to achieve their goal of bringing the woolly mammoth back to life. The film takes us from the archaic landscape of the New Siberian Islands to a mammoth museum in Yakutsk, a meeting of young scientists in Boston, the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, to a commercial cloning company in South Korea, and to gene data bank in Shenzhen, China.
Themes.
The film's Russian co-director, Maxim Abugaev, accompanied and filmed the Siberian mammoth tusk collectors during one hunting season. "(These) hunters are the native people of the North, who practice shamanism and believe in spirits of nature," says Abugaev. "They are very careful and superstitious in their approach to these uninhabited islands. We see the Arctic as a living creature of its own with mighty incomprehensible powers." "Genesis 2.0 deals with legends, myths and taboos and confronts us with our own fear of an unknown future," adds Frei.
In this situation, researchers such as George Church, Professor of Genetics at Harvard University see the potential of the science: "Synthetic biology is very likely to be the next big revolution. (...) Humans are very bold and they have vision. And they will follow that sometimes to their death."
Dr. Huanming Yang from the BGI Human Genome Center in Shenzhen sums up the future-oriented research shown in the film as follows: "We proposed the first project to sequence everything in the world. (...) God’s word is still imperfect. But if we work together we can make God perfect. The book of life is written with the same language. All the secrets are in this double helix." In this project, life becomes data.
Protagonists.
The professional mammoth hunter Peter Grigoriev and the unemployed stoker Spira Sleptsov share a desire to ultimately discover a spectacular mammoth tusk. Ivory, or "white gold", can be sold in China for high prices — and in order to reach this goal, the hunters are risking a great deal. They are torn between two driving forces: the promise of a great discovery and their spiritual belief that it is forbidden to disturb the mammoths’ remains.
Peter Grigoriev's brother, the paleontologist Semyon Grigoriev, is the director of the mammoth museum in Yakutsk. His goal is to one day be able to create a clone of a woolly mammoth. In order to realize this ambition he travels to South Korea, together with his wife, Lena Grigorieva, to visit the biotech company named Sooam, lead by Hwang Woo-suk. In 2005, Hwang made headlines because his stem cell research was deemed as fraud; today he is the director of a successful commercial company that specializes in cloning dogs.
The woolly mammoth is an object of interest not only for cloning researchers but also for molecular biologists and geneticists. One of them is George Church, a Harvard professor of genetics who uses state-of-the-art technological methods for his research in synthetic biology. He is currently working on "editing" an elephant similar to a mammoth — a "mammophant".
Release.
The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018 and was awarded with the World Cinema Documentary Special Jury Award for Cinematography. Swiss cameraman Peter Intergand and Russian filmmaker Maxim Arbugaev were responsible for the cinematography; Arbugaev also co-directed the film.
Reception.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80%, based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 5.1/10. Similar review aggregator Metacritic calculated a score of 60 based on 5 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
In "The Hollywood Reporter", Sheri Linden writes that the film is a real-life thriller structured like a double helix, simultaneously frightening and unforgettable: “At the center of the heady mix is the woolly mammoth, a long-extinct species that key figures in the exquisitely crafted documentary are determined to revive. Those figures speak, without irony or warning, of the power to design bodies and perfect God's work.”
She continues: “With elegance and poignancy, the score by Max Richter and Edward Artemyev sounds its own alarms, a stirring match for the striking camerawork by a number of cinematographers. And through the divergent paths of two Yakutian brothers, the film throws into question the simplistic notion of mercenary selfishness versus the purity of science.”
Wendy Idy from "Screendaily" finds the beginning of the film esoteric, as it opens with a female voice intoning a passage from a Yakutian epic tale. In her review, Idy emphasizes the significance of the film's basic message: “The overarching theme is humanity’s reckless courage — as such, it’s a picture which finds its closest parallels in the films of Werner Herzog.”

The film's cinematography is by Shyam K Naidu, while the score and soundtrack is composed by Mani Sharma. The film is released worldwide on 28 December 2017 to good reviews from critics and audience. The film was later dubbed and released in Hindi as "Shoorveer 2" in 2019 and also in Malayalam as "Parallel Crime" in 2020.
Plot.
The story starts off with a couple in a parking lot. Their son Jeeva (Allu Sirish) finds Jyothsna aka Jo (Surbhi). They quickly fall in love, and then a few weeks later, Jo invites Jeeva to her apartment. She then shows that she enjoys people-watching, and two interesting subjects, Srinivas (Srinivas Avasarala) and Swathi (Seerat Kapoor). The young couple constantly feuds, and Jeeva chooses to follow around Srinivas, who reveals his love story to Jeeva. 
Remarkably, the thing happening in Jo's life has already happened in Swathi's life. They visit a scientist (Jayaprakash), who says that they have parallel lives and the final outcome is the same, which means that whatever is happening to Swati will happen with Jo after a year. When they return to the apartment, they find out that Swathi has been murdered, and Srinivas is the killer. Jeeva (who knows that Srinivas loves Swati deeply) is not willing to accept the fact and questioned Srinivas about this. At first, he refuses, but he later reveals that Swati committed suicide as she was not able to cope with the grief of accidentally killing five newborn babies. But after knowing that Jo does not have the courage to commit suicide, Jeeva was certain that Swati was murdered as she and Jo are the same.
After a lot of efforts, Jeeva came to know that Swati was killed by the MD of Olympus Hospital, T. S. Tarun (Arun Kumar Dasari) , as she came to know that the five kids died in the hospital due to the negligence of the management. Later that night, Jo came to know about this from Swati's mail. For this reason, Tarun tried to kill Jo; however, Jeeva saved her in the nick of time and killed Tarun, thereby changing the prediction of the scientist.
Production.
The film met with trouble for a brief period of time over the allegations that the film borrows the script from a Korean film titled "Parallel Life". Another producer Anil Sunkara reportedly had already brought the remake rights of the same film for his next production venture, "2 Memiddaram". Prior to the release, it was assumed that the story line of "Okka Kshanam" closely followed the same path, Sunkara allegedly filed a complaint against the makers with the film chamber. However, once the producer saw the film and understood the same and even wished the team good luck for release on his official Twitter page. Post release, it was cleared that Vi Anand’ s story and the screenplay was original. The director was also unanimously appreciated for his screenwriting in the film.
Soundtrack.
Music was composed by Mani Sharma and was released on Lahari Music.

Gebirah

In the Hebrew Bible, Gebirah (; , "gĕvîrâ", "-bîrâ"; feminine of , "gĕvîr", "-bîr", meaning 'lord') is a title ascribed to several queen mothers of Israel and Judah.
Description.
Literally translated, the title means 'Great Lady' ("Lady" being the feminine counterpart etymologically to the male honorific "Lord"). However, given that this title is most often attributed to a queen mother, the two have become synonymous, and therefore "gĕbîrâ" is most often translated as 'Queen Mother'. When romanised, "gĕbîrâ" can be used as both a common noun ("a gebirah", "the gebirah") or a proper noun ("the Gebirah"), as with most royal titles. Although not present in the Masoretic Texts, the plural form "gĕbîrôt" is commonly used by academics to avoid the intra-word switching of "gebirahs".
The "gebirah" is believed by some scholars to have held great power as counsel of the king. In 1 Kings 2:20, Solomon said to his Mother Bathsheba, seated on a throne at his right, "Make your request, Mother, for I will not refuse you". The position of the queen mother "(gĕbîrâ)" was a privilege of the highest honour, and was the highest authority for a woman in Israel or Judah. In fact, the only time a woman held higher office was in the case of Athaliah, who held the throne of Judah as queen in her own right, despite being illegitimate in the eyes of the scripture. 
To further complicate matters, the word "gĕberet" (; , also , "gĕbirĕt", and , "gĕbāret", meaning 'lady', 'mistress', or 'queen') occurs 9 times in the Masoretic Text. In comparison, "gĕbîrâ" occurs only 6 times. Scholars generally take one of two stances with "gĕberet": either classing it as an acceptable variation of the word "gĕbîrâ" within the ketiv (featuring a common qere), or opting for a distinct separation of the two words, despite their converged meanings.
In Christianity.
William G. Most, a Catholic author, sees in the "gebirah" a type of Mary.

Synopsis.
Every human heart is running behind to catch its wishes and achieve betterment in life. Drama serial "Yaar-e-Bewafa" is also focusing on the issue that how selfish a person can behave, when they get a little hope for the better future, even they forget their present belongings and relationships. This play revolves around two different families which will connect each other with the progression of events.
Zaid is living with his mother, wife and a son. His mother raises him with much suffering and many difficulties after the death of his father. She made sure about his quality studies despite their financial problems. Zaid met his wife (Fiza) in university and they fall in love with each other. Fiza belongs to a rich family while Zaid is just a white collar guy. Fiza's parent opposes her below standard choice and discontinues their connection with her after wedding.
Another dimension of the play is Saleem's family, who live with his wife (Amna) and a son. He is kind of short-tempered, truculent and works in a chemical factory. Once he gets ill and after a complete diagnosis, shocking news reveals that he is suffering from lungs cancer. Now Amna faces financial crises due to Saleem's illness.
The fate brings another woman in Zaid's life after the departure of Fiza. They both develop strong bonding, affection and soft corner for each other. Fiza who is busy in collecting materialistic happiness for her, seems like she is losing them forever.
Is it a sensible act to value our future happiness while ignoring present happiness?

De Roosdonck, Nuenen

De Roosdonck is a windmill located at the Gerwenseweg 2 in Nuenen, in the province of North Brabant, Netherlands. Built in 1884, the windmill was initially planned to be built as a smock mill. After the structure collapsed soon after completion, the mill was rebuilt to the current "beltmolen" type, with a pile of sand put around the mill allowing it to be built higher. Vincent van Gogh, who lived in Nuenen from 1883 to 1885, painted and drew De Roosdonck a total of 7 times. The most famous painting in his Nuenen period, The Potato Eaters, was painted in the neighbouring cottage. 
The windmill was built by Antonius van Himbergen from nearby Bladel, who has also built the Annemie windmill in Acht, and other similar type windmills in the area. From 1887 to 1930 the windmill was also used as an oil mill, with the machinery bought from the miller of Sint Victor in Heeze.
Due to industrialisation and the introduction of other sources of energy, professional production of flower stopped in 1959. The mill deteriorated. After purchase by the local government in 1970, the windmill was restored in 1972, with further restorations in 1984 and 1996. Since 1995 the windmill has been in private hands once again, with the son of the last professional miller as its owner. Also since that year the windmill has been open for visitors, selling a wide range of organic flour products.

Araneta City Cyberpark

The Araneta City Cyberpark is a office development located in The Araneta City in Cubao, Quezon City. The office complex is currently undergoing redevelopment under a new master plan, consisting of five green office towers, retail spaces, and an outdoor park. The ongoing development currently includes 2 towers completed, and one tower under construction, with of office space completed as of January 2021.
The ACI Inc. is the owner and developer of the project. The redevelopment project is part of the Araneta City Master Plan.
History.
The Araneta City Cyberpark is part of the Araneta City master plan unveiled in 2000, and was rolled out in 2002, situated in an property along Gen. Aguinaldo, Gen. Araneta, and Gen. McArthur Avenues, primarily for BPO/IT office development. The development sits on a jeepney terminal servicing areas around Quezon City and the Province of Rizal, and the private Araneta White House (Bahay na Puti) complex. It also sits on the former lot occupied by Fiesta Carnival, a amusement park formerly occupying the Shopwise Hypermarket complex. As the carnival declined in the 1990s due to mall-based entertainment and other technological shifts, the Araneta Group decided to move the carnival into an open lot located in the south west corner lot of the complex, across SM Cubao. Unfortunately, the outdoor complex did not click the public and was completely closed down years later.
The first master plan of the Cyberpark was laid out and began construction in 2007, before being completed on 2008. The complex is composed of 2 4-storey low-rise buildings (with 7 low rise buildings planned during the early planning phases). The two buildings were occupied by companies, such as Telus, APAC Customer Services Inc., Advanced Contact Solutions, Agentworx Contact Solutions, and Expert Global Solutions. 
As demand for office spaces grew and expanded over the years, along with the country's stable and growing economy, a newer and updated master plan was finalised, consisting of 5 PEZA certified and LEED-approved towers, with 2 levels of retail (initially 5), surrounding an outdoor park, and connected to malls and nearby buildings such as SM Cubao, Ali Mall, the Manhattan Gardens condominiums, the Araneta Coliseum, the New Frontier Theater, the Novotel Manila Araneta City and the upcoming Ibis Styles Araneta City. The development is also outlined to interconnect all office towers within the Cyberpark through the complex's basement parking and retail levels, and will also include an planned road extension of the Gen. Araneta Avenue, linking the road to the P. Tuazon Boulevard.
The development is also connected to major transport hubs such as the MRT 3 Cubao Station, the LRT 2 Cubao Station and transport terminals, with future connections to the Gateway Mall 3, and the Gateway Mall 2, primarily attracting business process outsourcing and corporate services companies. The complex also features an ultra-high-speed fiber optic network infrastructure, enhancing the city's network connectivity, capable of reaching 5G networks. The targeted completion of the entire green office complex is set within 2030.
Facilities.
Telus House.
The Telus House is one of the first low-rise, 4-storey buildings in the original Cyberpark plan completed in 2008, and currently houses Telus as its main tenant. The building has of total office space, and features retail stores located at the ground floor.
The building will soon be demolished in order to give way for the construction of the Gateway Mall 3, a 2-storey expansion project of the Gateway Mall, and the Cyberpark Tower 4. The future development will feature eco-friendly initiatives, additional retail spaces and an elevated, green, outdoor park. The construction of the new buildings is expected to begin within the next 4-5 years.
Cyberpark Tower 1.
The first tower in the project, and standing 30 storeys high on the former EGS parking lot. The construction of the tower started in February 2014, and was completed in May 2016. The Cyberpark Tower 1 has of office space, with 3 basement parking levels, 2 levels of retail, and houses companies like 24-7 Intouch, Stellar, Sterling, Genesys, Accenture, and The Vibal Group, as well as The Medical City Clinic Cubao Branch. The Tower will is also connected to nearby SM Cubao via Elevated Bridge.
One of the planned original tenants of the tower was Expert Global Solutions (EGS), after the company announced its plans to relocate their operation to the tower in early 2016. However, after lengthy negotiations with the Araneta Group and Alorica's acquisition of EGS, the plan was cancelled and the company decided to remain in their operations to the Alorica Building until March 2019, as the company moved its operations to Cyberpark Tower 2.
The tower features floor-to-ceiling double glazed windows for energy efficiency, a rainwater collection system, and is also equipped with Solar panels located at the roof deck of the building. The tower was also soon to be directly connected to the Gateway Mall 3 along with Cyberpark Tower 4.
Cyberpark Tower 2.
The second tower of the project, standing 31 storeys high on the former Jeepney Terminal servicing areas within Quezon City and the Province of Rizal, the Cyberpark Tower 2 has of office space, featuring floor-to-ceiling double-glazed energy-efficient windows, smart elevators, side balconies with planters, and a rainwater recovery system. The tower was also planned to include vertical trellises and erect a spire from the tower's side balconies, to the tower's helipad area. However, the plan was scrapped during the tower's construction phase. The construction of the tower started in February 2016, and was topped off on March 2018, before being completed in December 2018. 
The tower houses companies like Alorica, occupying the first 7 floors of the tower, with plans to occupy more floors, as well as Pizza Hut, and Dairy Queen (with the main office still located at the Aurora Tower), and Ibex.
Cyberpark Tower 3.
The third tower of the project, Cyberpark Tower 3 is currently under construction, soon to rise on the former Alorica (EGS) Building site. The tower will be similarly designed to the Cyberpark Tower 2, standing 31 storeys high, and having of office spaces. The tower also features floor-to-ceiling double-glazed energy-efficient windows, smart elevators, side balconies with planters, and a rainwater recovery system. The demolition of the Alorica Building began in June 2019, while the groundbreaking for the construction of the tower started afterwards, in September 2019. The tower is slated to be completed on 2022, however, due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines, as well as market driven factors and financial problems, the construction of the project was delayed, and the tower's completion is set to be determined within the next 2-3 years. On August 2021, the general contractor for the project was awarded to Datem Incorporated, while the tower's construction date is still to be determined.
Cyberpark Tower 4.
The fourth tower of the project, Cyberpark Tower 4 is a planned 30-storey office building planned to be built on the Telus House, with a planned direct connection to the Gateway Mall 3. The tower will also have the same features with its predecessors, with the targeted construction of the project is expected to start within the next 4-5 years.
Cyberpark Tower 5.
The fifth and final office building planned in the Cyberpark complex, the Cyberpark Tower 5 is a planned 40-storey office building planned to be built on the Jeepney Terminal and the private Araneta White House complex, which includes the Colombian Honorary Consulate, located along Cyberpark Tower 2, the Cyberpark Tower 3, and P. Tuazon Boulevard.

From 1964 to 1965 he taught at the Deccan College, Pune. In 1967, he went to Delhi and joined Delhi University as a lecturer of Linguistics where he remained until 1975.

Meteor III

Meteor III was a schooner-rigged yacht built in the United States for the German Emperor Wilhelm II. She was third in a series of "Meteor" pleasure crafts Wilhelm had. Launched in 1902 it was the world's largest yacht built at the time. The yacht was mainly a pleasure craft, but did participate in races. She was christened by the daughter of US President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in attendance with Prince Henry of Prussia and two thousand spectators. The yacht had a 40-year career with twelve owners, some of who upgraded the yacht. She was requisitioned by the United States Navy during World War II for service and became the property of the United States government. Ultimately the yacht was sold out for scrap. 
History.
"Meteor III", designed by naval architect Archibald Cary Smith, was an improved and enlarged version of the yacht "Yampa" which was originally built by Smith for Chester W. Chapin, a United States Congressman from Massachusetts. "Yampa" had several owners and was eventually purchased by the German emperor. It was renamed "Iduna" and participated in European regattas. The emperor was so pleased with the performance of "Iduna" that he placed an order with Smith for the construction of a larger and improved version. The new schooner yacht was named "Meteor III" following the scheme the emperor had of naming his pleasure craft, as she was the next sequenced "Meteor." 
"Meteor III" was built by Townsend-Downey Shipbuilding Company at Shooters Island in New York City and launched February 25, 1902. It took four months to construct from Smith's architectural drawings. Alice Roosevelt, US President Theodore Rooselvelt's 18 year old daughter, christened the yacht upon launch. The emperor's younger brother, Prince Henry, traveled from Europe to New York City to attend as the German emperor's personal representative. Two thousand spectators were at the 10:30 a.m. launching including President Roosevelt and Prince Henry.
Alice christened the schooner by breaking a bottle of champagne against the steel side of the yacht. She proclaimed in a loud clear voice, "I christen thee Meteor." Up to that point the yacht was just labeled job No. 24 by the shipyard. Alice then cut the holding cord to a key block of weights that held the yacht in place on the dock support cradle, using a silver-looking nickel hatchet. Cannons were fired, brass bands played and there was a twenty-one gun salute.
Alice struck the bow of the yacht with her palm as it started moving into the water leaving its supports. President Roosevelt and Prince Henry followed her example. Nearby German officers did the same, with some nearly being knocked off their feet as the yacht was picking up speed. Immediately after the yacht was launched into the water, a message was cabled to Berlin from Prince Henry to the emperor saying, "Yacht just launched under brilliant auspices. Christened by Miss Roosevelt's hand. Beautiful craft. Great enthusiasm. I congratulate you" – Heinrich.
In 1909, "Meteor III" was put up for sale by the emperor. She eventually was sold to professor Carl Harries of the University of Kiel. She was renamed "Nordstern" and took part in the Kiel Regatta. Harries put the yacht up for sale in 1921 in Barcelona, Spain. It was bought by Maurice Bunau-Varilla, owner of the Paris newspaper "Le Matin." In 1924 Bunau-Varilla sold "Meteor III" to Italian baron Alberto Fassini. In 1932 Fassini sold the vessel to a Mr. Gillet, who turned her over to Camper and Nicholsons, British yacht brokers. After being on the market for awhile she was sold to the American Francis Lenn Taylor, father of Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor used her for several years as a pleasure craft. He then sold her to Sterling Hayden. It was later repossessed because Hayden defaulted on the financial arrangements. In 1940 Taylor then resold her to Gerald S. Foley who later sold her to a Mr. David Feinburg, who sold her to Nicholas Allen. The last owner gave the schooner yacht the name "Aldebaran." The United States Navy requisitioned her during World War II for service and the craft became the property of the War Shipping Administration (WSA).
The yacht had ultimately passed through twelve owners, some of who updated the yacht. The vessel during this time had received new engines, radio equipment and a third mast. The yacht at one time was used as a fishing vessel. In 1942 she was taken to Shooters Island by the WSA since they then owned her. "Aldebaran," previously the German emperor's "Meteor III", in 1945 was sold for $2,100 to John Witte, an iron salvager at Staten Island who did business a short distance from where "Meteor III" was originally constructed in 1902. Witte then took the craft apart for scrap iron.
Description.
"Meteor III" had a overall length of with on the water line and a width of . The draft was and the sail area was . Her cost was $150,000. "Meteor III" was the largest yacht in the world when made for the emperor. The overall boat layout design was left to Smith, but the emperor participated in the interior arrangements. The interior rooms were paneled with mahogany and decorated in colonial Adam's style. "Meteor III," although mainly a pleasure craft with luxury accommodations, did participate in race events.

Yulia Alexandrova Portunova (; born May 4, 1994) is a Russian curler from Kaliningrad. She competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics as the alternate for the Olympic Athletes from Russia women's curling team skipped by Victoria Moiseeva. She was also the alternate for the Moiseeva rink when they won the 2016 European Curling Championships. She currently plays third on Team Alina Kovaleva.
Career.
Portunova broke onto the national stage at the 2013 World Junior Curling Championships where she threw fourth stones for the Russian team skipped by Alina Kovaleva. After qualifying for the tiebreaker round with a 5–4 round robin record, the Russian team won four sudden death games en route to capturing the World Junior title. It was Russia's first title at the event since 2006. They returned to defend their title the following season at the 2014 World Junior Curling Championships but lost in the 3 vs. 4 page playoff game to Sweden's Isabella Wranå. They then defeated Sweden in the bronze medal game to secure third place and bronze medals for the tournament.
Portunova was the alternate for Team Victoria Moiseeva who represented Russia at the 2016 European Curling Championships. The team qualified for the event by defeating the two-time world bronze medallist Anna Sidorova rink in the Russian Supercup. Despite entering the event as rookies, the team qualified for the playoffs with a 6–3 record. They then upset Scotland's Eve Muirhead 11–6 in the semifinal to qualify for the final where they faced Sweden's Anna Hasselborg. Tied 4–4 in the final end, Hasselborg missed her final draw, giving the Russian's two points and the victory. Also during the 2016–17 season, Team Moiseeva won the silver medal at the 2017 Winter Universiade, losing to Canada's Kelsey Rocque in the final.
The Sidorova rink was initially selected to represent Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but after their poor play during the 2017–18 season, the Russian Curling Federation was forced to hold a best-of-seven Olympic Trials between Team Moiseeva and Team Sidorova to see who would represent the "Olympic Athletes from Russia" team at the Olympics. Team Moiseeva won the series four games to one, earning them the Olympic spot. At the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, the team struggled, finishing in a dismal ninth place with a 2–7 record. Team Moiseeva also represented Russia at the 2018 World Women's Curling Championship where Portunova played third on the team. They had a much stronger tournament at the World's, qualifying for the playoffs with a 7–5 round robin record and defeating the United States to win the bronze medal.
Portunova joined the Sidorova rink at third for the 2018–19 season. On the tour, the team won two events, the Karuizawa International and the International Bernese Ladies Cup and lost the final of the Stockholm Ladies Cup to Anna Hasselborg. The team also competed in three legs of the 2018–19 Curling World Cup, finishing in third at all three legs they attended. They competed in a best-of-seven series against the Alina Kovaleva rink to represent Russia at the 2019 World Women's Curling Championship, but lost the event four games to one.
Team Sidorova started the 2019–20 season at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic where they lost in the qualification game. They next played in the Stu Sells Oakville Tankard where they lost to Anna Hasselborg in the final. They missed the playoffs at the inaugural WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup before having a quarterfinal finish at the Women's Masters Basel. Despite their early successes on tour, Team Sidorova lost the Russian qualifier for the 2019 European Curling Championships to Alina Kovaleva in six games. They turned things around, however, the following month at the Karuizawa International where they went an undefeated 7–0 throughout the event and defeated Satsuki Fujisawa 5–4 in the final. They also had a semifinal finish at the Glynhill Ladies International and a quarterfinal finish at the International Bernese Ladies Cup. Their final event of the season was at the 2020 Russian Women's World Qualification Event where they would once again lose to the Kovaleva rink in a best of seven series.
Portunova and her team began the abbreviated 2020–21 season at the 2020 Russian Women's Curling Cup where they went undefeated until the final where they lost to Team Kovaleva. In December 2020, Team Sidorova competed in the 2020 national championship as it had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There, they topped the round robin with an 8–1 record, defeating the Kovaleva rink in their final round robin draw. They then lost both the 1 vs. 2 page playoff and final to Kovaleva, settling for silver. A "curling bubble" was set up in Calgary, Canada in the spring, which hosted a number of events, including the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship and two slams. Team Kovaleva qualified for all three events, and added Portunova to their lineup due to a conflict with the 2021 Russian Women's Curling Championship where their regular third Maria Komarova was representing the team. At the 2021 Champions Cup, the team qualfied for the playoffs before losing to Silvana Tirinzoni in the quarterfinals. They then missed the playoffs at the 2021 Players' Championship, finishing 2–3. The following week, the team represented the RCF (Russian Curling Federation) at the World Championships as Russia is prohibited from competing under its flag or any national symbols at any Olympic Games or world championships until December 16, 2022. The team finished second through the round robin with an 11–2 record, giving them a direct bye to the semifinals. They then defeated Sweden's Anna Hasselborg 8–7 in the semifinal before losing the final to Switzerland's Silvana Tirinzoni after Kovaleva missed a freeze on her final shot.

Traveloka

Traveloka is an Indonesian unicorn company that provides airline ticketing and hotel booking services online expanding rapidly into Southeast Asia and Australia. It recently expanded to provide lifestyle products and services, such as attraction tickets, activities, car rental, and restaurant vouchers.
History.
Traveloka was established in 2012 by information technology practitioners who returned from the United States to Indonesia, Derianto Kusuma, Ferry Unardi and Albert. They were joined in 2013 by the initiator of election result watch site KawalPemilu.org, Ainun Najib. In 2014, hotel reservations instead of just flight reservations were added. In 2017, train tickets and food features were added. At that time, it said it had raised funds to develop machine learning and AI.
Expedia became a minority investor in 2017, when Traveloka was operating in six countries and advertising heavily in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. In 2018, the company acquired three online travel agencies: Pegipegi from Indonesia, Mytour from Vietnam, and Travelbook from the Philippines. In 2019, it launched a home protection insurance plan in Indonesia, taking advantage of widespread travel durking the mudik tradition. Movie-booking was also added that year through Major Cineplex. It then introduced visa insurance for Indonesian travelers, to cover accidents, sickness, flight delays, and baggage loss. Later that year, it also began listing villas and apartments to book.
In January 2019, Traveloka opened a Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) center in Bangalore. Also it began releasing kiosks to buy tourist trips in Singapore.
In the beginning, Traveloka served as a search engine to compare the price of airline tickets from various other sites. In mid-2013, Traveloka then turned into a ticket reservation website, where users could place an order on its official website. By 2019, it had also moved into financial services as well as ticketing and hotel booking, and it had launched a credit card with Bank Rakyat Indonesia. Traveloka launched the "Xperience" brand in July 2019, initially in Thailand. It was active in Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore and Australia.
Within the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, in April 2020, the company laid off a significant portion of its staff as the demand for travel dropped significantly. The cuts affected 100 people in Indonesia. There had also been a "massive amount" of requests for refunds for travel plans.
 There was also in increase in trip cancelations.
On october 2020, Demand for travel accommodation was gradually recovering, as seen in the bookings for Indonesian hotels that had reached 75 percent of the pre-coronavirus figure, said Traveloka president Hendry Hendrawan. A positive transaction trend was also seen in its other major markets, Thailand and Vietnam, with transaction volume returning to pre-pandemic levels in Vietnam, and Thailand not far behind。 
Investment.
In November 2012, the company Traveloka announced its initial investment by East Ventures. In September 2013, the company announced a series investment by Global Founders Capital. Funds from investments are used to build new services such as hotel bookings and travel packages. In July 2017, Traveloka again get an injection of funds of Rp. 4.6 Trillion [9] from companies such as Expedia Inc., East Ventures, Hillhouse Capital Group, JD.com and Sequoia Capital.
By 2018, it was often referred as a unicorn company.
In April 2019, Traveloka announced it had raised $420 million dollars in a round led by Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, GIC. At the time, it was the largest online travel startup in Southeast Asia. While aiming to establish profit before going public, the company then was considering a dual listing in Indonesia and the United States, if it went through with an IPO. Henry Hendrawan was Traveloka Group's president. Apparently, the IPO had been delayed due to a slowing economy, as well as difficult IPOs by Uber and WeWork. Among backers at that time were GIC Pte Ltd, JD.com, and Expedia, and it had raised a total of $900m. Talks put the company's valuation at around $4.5 billion.
Acquisitions.
In December 2018, Traveloka announced it had acquired three online travel agencies (OTAs) – Indonesia’s Pegipegi, Vietnam’s Mytour, and the Philippines’ Travelbook – for US$66.8 million.

2018 French Polynesian legislative election

Legislative elections were held in French Polynesia on 22 April and 6 May 2018. On 22 April 2018, voters cast their ballots in the first round of the election to the Assembly of French Polynesia. A second round was held on 6 May 2018 for the three political parties that exceeded 12.5 percent of the vote in the first round. The new Tapura Huiraatira party emerged as the largest in the Assembly, winning 38 of the 57 seats.
Background.
The Tahoera'a Huiraatira party, an anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse, previously won 38 of the 57 seats in the Assembly in the 2013 general election. However, the governing Tahoera'a Huiraatira has been plagued by infighting and internal splits since 2013. Some former Tahoera'a Huiraatira members set up a new political party, which has since merged with the only other anti-independence party in the Assembly. Notably, Assembly Speaker Marcel Tuihani quit Tahoera'a Huiraatira in June 2017, and set up a rival party.
All French Polynesian political parties must alternate between male and female candidates to encourage a gender balance among legislative candidates.
The French High Commissioner of French Polynesia René Bidal announced the vote registration for the territorial election will be open from 12 March to 26 March 2018.
Electoral system.
The 57 members of the Assembly of French Polynesia are elected by a proportional multi-member list of two rounds, with a majority premium. Polynesia is a single constituency whose communes make up of eight sub-divisions called sections, each with a majority premium of 1 to 4 seats according to their population for a total of 19 premium seats.
Each list presents 73 candidates in the eight sections. Each list is composed alternately of a candidate of each sex. In the first round, the list having received an absolute majority of votes in its section is awarded the majority bonus, then the remaining seats are distributed proportionally among all the lists having crossed the electoral threshold of 5% of the votes according to the method of voting. If no list obtains more than 50% of the votes cast, a second round is held between all the lists having collected more than 12.5% of the votes, those having collected between 5% and 12.5% being able to merge with the lists that have been maintained. The leading list then gets the majority bonus, and the remaining seats are distributed proportionally under the same conditions.
The lists may be reimbursed for part of their campaign costs if they reach the threshold of 3% of the votes cast in the first round, provided that they comply with accounting transparency requirements and legislation on the format of documents.
Party participation.
In December 2017, France's ruling party, En Marche, which was founded by French President Emmanuel Macron, announced that it would contest the French Polynesian legislative election in 2018 for the first time. Efforts at forming a coalition involving En Marche and other known political figures in the territory, under the name "Here Fenua", reportedly failed in February 2018.
In February 2018, Oscar Temaru, leader of Tavini Huiraatira, said he will not rule out his party boycotting the election.
Banned candidates.
Former President of French Polynesia Gaston Flosse will not be allowed to stand for election in April 2018. He is not allowed to hold public office due to two convictions for public corruption in 2014 and 2016. Despite Flosse's claims he can stand in the election, based on advice given by his lawyers, an election court in Tahiti upheld the election ban against Flosse in January 2018.

Chu Tử

Chu Tử (, 1917 - 1975) was a Vietnamese journalist and writer.
Biography.
Chu Tử has a real name Chu Văn Bình (朱文平), he was born on 17 April 1917 at Mía Village, Sơn Tây Province (now Hanoi). He has graduated as a Bachelor of Laws of the Ecole Supérieure de Droit et Administration. He was at the same academic year with Nguyễn Thái Học. In the night of 10 February 1930, he followed VNQDD's leader Nguyễn Khắc Nhu to attack Hưng Hóa Fortrest. However, VNQDD was failed fastly, so he swam through the river and returned Hanoi to continue his study.
In Việt Minh era, Chu Văn Bình worked as a local lawyer. During the State of Vietnam, he was a principal of Phùng Hưng Private School in Haiphong and then Lê Văn Trung Primary-secondary School in Tây Ninh.
After the Saigon Coup when the freedom of the press was respected, he has established "Living Daily News" ("Nhật-báo Sống") at Hồ Xuân Hương Road (old Saigon) and started using pen name Chu Tử. In 1966, the Living was attacked by UBSV forces. On 16 April 1966, he was shot 4 with Colt 9 shots near his house (next Hoài An School, Phú Nhuận District, Saigon) but he was lucky to live. This event was which Saigon's public opinion doubted Việt Cộng but Republic of Vietnam's presses found out quickly the culprit being UBSV's rifle shot.
At the last of 1960s, Living was blocked forever for the pounding condemnation when Vietnamese government allowed the United States Army full powers to use Cam Ranh Bay. Living's articles called that act as the "betraying the country". In 1971, Chu Tử has re-established it as "Tidal Wave Daily News" ("Nhật-báo Sóng-Thần"), then "Viet People D.N." ("Dân-Việt"), "Life D.N." ("Ðời"), but these newspapers also existed in very short times.
On 30 April 1975, at 10:00, Chu Tử was dead by RPG-2 when he stood on the to leave Saigon. He with one boy were buried at Cần Giờ water front.

Les Misérables (British TV series)

Les Misérables is a British television series based on the 1862 French historical novel of the same name by Victor Hugo. Adapted by Andrew Davies and directed by Tom Shankland, it stars Dominic West, David Oyelowo, and Lily Collins.
The series was produced by the BBC with support from PBS member station WGBH Boston's "Masterpiece" series. BBC Studios handles the distribution for the series. It was broadcast in the United Kingdom between 30 December 2018 and 3 February 2019. In Canada, the series started broadcasting on 10 January 2021 on CBC and CBC Gem.
Production.
Development.
The Weinstein Company was initially set to co-produce the series and serve as its distributor in the U.S. and China. The studio was dropped, however, following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations. PBS member station WGBH Boston, through their television series Masterpiece, replaced The Weinstein Company as a co-producer of the series.
Filming.
Filming for the series began in February 2018 in Belgium and Northern France.
Release.
BBC Studios handles distribution for the series. The drama, which consists of six episodes, premiered on 30 December 2018. In New Zealand, the series was released on TVNZ 1 and its free streaming service TVNZ OnDemand.
In the US, the series was aired on PBS, starting 21 April 2019, to end on 19 May 2019.
Reception.
"Les Misérables" has received positive reviews from critics. The miniseries holds a 87% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes with an average score of 7.53/10, based on 39 critic reviews. The site's consensus reads "Andrew Davies' deft adaptation of the oft-retold Victor Hugo classic affords viewers a newfound intimacy with these outcasts and revolutionaries, who are ably brought to life by a star-studded cast."
Collins' performance as Fantine received praise from critics. Alexandra Pollard of "The Independent" praised her performance, writing "she plays the tragic Fantine with steeliness and grace", and described it as "magnificent." West's performance as Valjean in the final episode also received critical praise. Gabriel Tate of "The Telegraph" praised his performance, writing "Dominic West steals the show in a stirring finale."
The television mini-series on PBS was described as "an engrossing treat, featuring a vibrant cast and taking its time to unspool the melodrama and offer loving looks at 19th century France." It "hews closely to the source material without skipping too much plot or character motivations", the source material being the 19th century novel by Victor Hugo. The casting is commended, with many strong performances. The plot cannot carry all the detail of Hugo's novel of his characters in a tumultuous time in France, but "when all the cannons are fired and last stands are taken, the sacrifices given do not feel insignificant.". The story is told keeping "the narrative clear and allowing character-driven scenes to breathe."
Allison Keene of "Collider" wrote, "Emotional, engrossing" with 5 stars.

Giorgio Coricelli

Giorgio Coricelli is professor of economics and psychology at the University of Southern California, specializing in neuroeconomics. Having done his undergraduate studies at La Sapienza in Rome, he then completed his Ph.D. at the Economic Science Laboratory of the University of Arizona studying with Vernon Smith, shortly before Smith received his Nobel Prize in economics in 2002.
His research focuses on neuroeconomics, experimental economics and game theory. Besides Vernon Smith, he collaborated with Kevin McCabe, Aldo Rustichini and Sarah-Jayne Blakemore. He founded the Neuroeconomics Lab at USC, while being a member of the CNRS and of the CIMEC lab in Trento, Italy.
Research.
Coricelli was trained by the founding father of experimental economics, Vernon Smith, and later joined in 2004 the Institut des Sciences Cognitives in Lyon, France, to perform experimental research using neuroimaging. His work combines economics with scientific psychology, and aims at "understanding human behaviors emerging from the interplay of cognitive and emotional systems" in the human mind, more specifically "the role of emotions in decision-making and the relational complexity in social interaction".
His most cited work investigated counterfactual thinking and its locus of activity in the brain, in particular for the emotion of regret. Using game theory and in collaboration with Rosemarie Nagel, he also investigated strategic thinking and identified the brain loci of different levels of strategic reasoning (in beauty contest games). His most recent work has focused on bounded rationality, social uncertainty, social learning, and impaired decision-making. Among his influences are William James and Piero Sraffa. He coined the term "neuroeconomics" while working at Vernon Smith's lab in Arizona.

South West Africa Command

South West Africa Command was a command of the South African Army.
History.
Origin.
South West Africa Command was one of the South African Defence Force's regional commands, which made up the Territorial Force. 
Based in Windhoek, it was initially responsible for the security of the entire South West Africa, forming the main level of command for military operations providing logistic, administrative and service support to all units and formations operating in its area of responsibility as well as support for the Police.
South West Africa Command was established in 1939 under a Union Government Proclamation, No 234 of 1939. At that stage it consisted of a citizen force component with a support company and signals.
Establishment of local Infantry.
By December 1939, the Commands first unit, 1 SWA Infantry Battalion was established.
Establishment of a local commando system.
By 1940, 32 defence rifle clubs were also established but were upgraded by 1948 to rifle commandos. 
In 1957 the Infantry Battalion was converted to an armored car regiment and the rifle commandos were upgraded to full commandos.
Formation of the SWATF.
With the formation of the South West Africa Territorial Force in 1977, South West Africa Command's area of responsibility was diminished by 1980 to the frontline sectors of the territory.
SADF Frontline Sectors Control.
By the 1990s, South West Africa Command controlled Sectors 10, 20 and 70. All local SWATF forces in these sectors also fell directly under SWA Command. 
Modular Battalions.
Modular Battalions main function was internal operations. Sub units were attached according to the requirements of a specific situation, i.e. the "modular nature". 
These units were made up from temporary elements (or ‘modules’) from a variety of units and would be deployed in company patrol bases along the border. 53 Battalion for example would have companies from 1 SAI, the Cape Town Highlanders, Rand Light Infantry and 6 SAI allocated to it for a particular season, while 54 Battalion would source its infantry elements from 8 SAI and the SACC. 
There was usually a company of SWATF attached to each Modular Battalion on rotation to provide ‘local knowledge’ and various elements of 1 SWA Specialist Unit were also attached to provide tracking and patrolling expertise. Koevoet or Romeo-Mike teams were also frequently stationed in these company bases for mutual protection, but would generally operate independently. 
The Modular Battalions’ heavy weapons often included a wide variety of captured Soviet and obsolete British World War II-era items, which were usually static, being primarily intended for base defence. Motor transport was limited, with a few Buffels being retained for patrolling and SAAF helicopters often being utilised for inter-base liaison. The companies of a Modular Battalion were generally weak during the quiet dry season (maybe 30- 50% strength), but would each be brought up to the full strength of five platoons in time for the wet season, which was when the bush would become jungle and SWAPO-PLAN infiltration teams would stream southwards. Their main responsibility was to secure their assigned area in which they conducted cordon and search operations, patrols, checkpoints, mine sweeping and the protection of roads and water systems.

Gauweiler and Others v Deutscher Bundestag

Gauweiler and Others v Deutscher Bundestag (2015) C-62/14 is an EU law case relevant for banking law which approved outright monetary transactions that were needed to save the Eurozone from financial turmoil.
Facts.
The German Constitutional Court asked the CJEU whether the European Central Bank buying govt bonds issued by euro states (the ‘Outright Monetary Transactions’ programme), in a 6 September 2012 press release, was unlawful, either because it was economic policy, not monetary policy, or because it violated TFEU art 123(1) which prohibited monetary financing for member states. This followed a conservative German politician named Peter Gauweiler challenging the ability of the Eurozone to assist non-German member states that were in financial difficulty. The ECB said it would buy bonds on the secondary markets issued by states if (1) the state became subject to the European Financial Stability Facility assistance programme and the European Stability Mechanism (2) transactions focused on the shorter part of the yield curve (3) no quantitative limits were set in advance (4) the ECB got the same treatment as private creditors (5) the ECB undertook that liquidity created would be fully sterilised. 
AG Cruz Villalon gave an opinion in favour of the EU policy.
Judgment.
The Grand Chamber of the CJEU held that the European Central Bank could adopt a programme to buy government bonds on the secondary markets under TFEU articles 119, 123, 127 and articles 17 to 24 of Protocol (No 4) on the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank. The outright monetary transaction programme was monetary policy, and measures taken were proportionate to the objectives without contravening TFEU art 123.

Pringle v Government of Ireland (2012) C‑370/12 is an EU law case, which held the European Stability Mechanism was lawful. 
Facts.
Thomas Pringle, an anti-austerity Independent MP (Teachta Dála) in Ireland, claimed that the European Stability Mechanism was unlawful, because it exceeded the EU’s exclusive competence for monetary policy, and went beyond the TFEU powers. The ESM was created with the ESM Treaty, signed by the euro area Member States on 2nd February 2012. It was made possible by the European Council Decision 2011/199/EU that adopted, under article 48(6)TEU, a simplified Treaty revision procedure leading to the introduction of Art 136(3)TFEU containing the following text: 
"The Member States whose currency is the euro may establish a stability mechanism to be activated if indispensable to safeguard the stability of the euro area as a whole. The granting of any required financial assistance under the mechanism will be made subject to strict conditionality". 
On 27 September 2012, Member States created a €500bn fund aimed at providing financial assistance to those Member States heavily affected by the financial crisis (replacing the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism). Member States could obtain the financial aid if they signed a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’.
Judgment.
Irish Supreme Court.
The Irish Supreme Court made a reference for preliminary ruling to the CJEU. It asked whether the simplified revision procedure could be used, if the principles of effective judicial protection and legal certainty prevented the ESM Treaty.
European Court of Justice.
The CJEU held that the European Stability Mechanism was lawful.

Azerbaijan–OBSEC relations

The relationship between Azerbaijan and Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation dates back to 1992 when Azerbaijan signed Istanbul Summit Declaration and the Bosphorus Statement.
Background.
Black Sea Economic Cooperation was formed according to the Istanbul Summit Declaration and the Bosphorus Statement signed on 25 June 1992 by the Heads of State and Government of the countries in the region. BSEC gained international legal identity when it was transformed into a full-fledged organization - the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation on May 1, 1999 after its Charter entered into force.
The Organization has 12 member states (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, and Ukraine) cooperating on various areas like agriculture, finance, education, culture, tourism, trade, transport, energy, and healthcare. Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs is the main decision-making organ. The Heads of the member countries meet generally every 5 years in the Summit Meetings.
History of relations.
Azerbaijan is one of the founding members of the OBSEC and since 25 June 1992. Azerbaijan collaborates on trade, customs, transport, energy, environment, information and communications, science and technology issues based on mutual interests with the member states.
Due to the ongoing conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan started to actively participate in the work of OBSEC after ceasefire was declared. The President of Azerbaijan attended in the Summit of OBSEC on 25 October 1996 for the first time and signed Moscow Declaration. President Heydar Aliyev addressed the business conference on “New opportunities to Black Sea Region” on April 28, 1997 in Istanbul. He also attended the Meeting of Head of the States held in Yalta (1998), and in Istanbul (1999 and 2002). During these events, he met with the presidents of member states and discussed mutual relations on different issues.
During the period of 1992-2003, relations between OBSEC and Azerbaijan were more advisory, but since 2003 the relations have been characterized by the development of cooperation in specific areas. The relations with OBSEC are developing at a low pace because conflicts between member states (Azerbaijan-Armenia, Russia-Georgia, Greece-Turkey) and economic crisis have weakened inter-institutional integration processes.
President Ilham Aliyev accepted General Secretary of OBSEC Valeri Chechelashvili in November 2003, ministers of education of member states in April 2004, Secretary General Tedo Japaridze in February 2006, Leonidas Chrysanthopoulos in June 2006. On June 25, 2007, President Ilham Aliyev participated in the Summit of the Heads of States of the BSEC Member States dedicated to the 15th anniversary of the organization.
Delegation of Milli Majlis visited Georgia to attend 42nd Meeting of PABSEC in December 2013. During this visit, extending cooperation among member states, improving agriculture in the region, causes of global climate change, considering possible options to eliminate harmful effects of this process were discussed.
In September 2013, the 41st meeting of PABSEC Committee on Economy, trade, technology and ecology was held in Ganja with the participation of representatives of Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Greece. MP Musa Guliyev was appointed as the head of PABSEC Committee on Economy, trade, technology and ecology.

Azerbaijan hold Chairmanship on May 1 – November 2009 according to the decision adopted at the 20th Meeting of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs on 15–16 April 2009. During the period of chairmanship to OBSEC, Azerbaijan organized meetings of ministers of energy (18-19 September 2003), transport (1-3 October 2003), and tourism (25-26 September 2003). Besides, Azerbaijan hosted 9th and 11th meetings of the Council of Foreign Ministers of OBSEC. Serbia (formerly Serbia and Montenegro) ratified the Charter of the OBSEC and became the 12th member of the organization during the chairmanship of Azerbaijan in 2004.
During the presidency, the Azerbaijani state also attached special importance to simplifying trade in the Black Sea region and the development of small and medium-sized businesses. The two agreements on simplifying visa issues for businessmen and professional drivers in the region and the elimination of non-tariff barriers were discussed in various BSEC working groups to facilitate trade turnover. Azerbaijan also initiated to organize meetings of the Working Group on SMEs and seminars in order to develop small and medium-sized businesses in the region and to discuss the role of the states in this issue. Additionally, the project on improving the beekeeping in the Caucasus was established.

Derryconnessy

Derryconnessy () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Derryconnessy is bounded on the north by Derry More and Derrynaslieve townlands, on the west by Tonlegee townland, on the south by Arderry and Muineal townlands and on the east by Moneynure townland. Its chief geographical features are a stream, gravel pits and spring wells. Derryconnessy is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 112 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Derryconnessy was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 24 February 1614, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, "one pole of Dirriconosy to Phelim McHugh O'Reyly, Bryan McHugh O'Reyly and Cahir McHugh O'Reyly, the sons of Hugh Reyly, late of Ballaghaneo, County Cavan". Ballaghaneo is now the townland of Ballaghanea in Lurgan Parish, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Ramor, so the O'Reillys were removed a long way from their home by the Plantation. Hugh Reyly was the great-grandnephew of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eoghan na Fésóige mac Seoain, who ruled East Breifne from 1418–1449. The O’Reilly lands in Derryconnessy were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Direcumisk" with the proprietor being "Captain Payne" and the tenant as "Daniell McConnell".
A lease dated 31 January 1718 from Morley Saunders to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Derriconisey".
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Derryconessey". A further deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774 includes the lands of "Derryconesse otherwise Derryconessy".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Derryconnisy".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Derryhaunis" and the proprietor as "John Ennery".
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Derinyconesey otherwise Dereconocy".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list eleven tithepayers in the townland.
The Derryconnessy Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 36, being 17 males and 19 females. There were five houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was four, being 2 males and 2 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were five houses in the townland, three of which were uninhabited and one in the course of erection.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists four landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 21, being 9 males and 12 females. There were four houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are four families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland.
Antiquities.
There are stones inscribed in Irish in the stream dividing the western part of Derryconnessy from Tonlegee townland. The 1930s Dúchas Folklore collection give the following accounts of a battle fought there- (1) "A battle was fought in Crocán na gCamps, Derryconnessy; Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Crocán na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. There are Ogham stones at Crocán na gCampa." (2) "Long ago, when the early colonists came into this country, they had a big battle on the land now owned by Mr. Francis McGovern, Tonlagee, Corlough, Bawnboy, Co. Cavan. The field in which one army pitched their campaign is now called Cnocán na gCampa which means 'The little hill of the campus'. It is a pretty field with grass much greener than that in the neighbouring fields. Beside it, is the field where the battle was fought. It is a grey field covered with large stones which are said to be monuments to the men who fell in the battle and are buried under them. It is said that if the field was dug up, the bones of the dead would be found in it. A stream runs by the battle fields, and touches it on the two sides. The stream is almost choked up by big stones, and there are two stones among them, with old Irish writing on them. This is all the information that is available about the battle in this district. It is not known exactly what tribes had the battle, but it is known that it took place thousands of years ago. The fields are along the main road from Swanlinbar to Ballinamore.
If the accounts of the battle are correct then the name on the 1813 map "Derryhaunis" could be the Irish "Doire hAmhnais" meaning 'The Oakwood of Combat'.

Haval H2

The Haval H2 is a subcompact B-Segment CUV produced by the Chinese manufacturer Great Wall Motors.
History.
The Haval H2 Red Label debuted on the 2014 Beijing Auto Show. Despite having a Red Haval badge, the crossover was launched before the Red and Blue label market strategy. The Haval H2 Blue Label was launched later on the 2016 Chengdu Auto Show making the H2 the first Haval to be sold in both red and blue labels. While being priced similarly and having the same powertrain and performance, Red Label cars usually feature more conservative styling and Blue Label cars feature more aggressive styling and is aimed at younger markets.
The Haval H2 is powered by a turbocharged, 1.5-litre four-cylinder petrol engine producing 110kW and 210Nm and mated to a six-speed automatic transmission.
As of July 2021, ANCAP's website lists the Haval H2 as having received the maximum safety ranking, five stars. 
Malaysia.
The Haval H2 was launched in Malaysia in May 2016 with three variants available: Standard, Comfort and Premium. The Standard could only be had with a six-speed manual gearbox while the Comfort and Premium variants could only be had with a six-speed automatic unit. Early models were fully imported from China with locally assembled models officially available as of September 2016. Only two locally assembled models were available: Comfort and Premium.

1C1 3900

1C1 3900 was a class of SNCF electric locomotive. The class had only one member, 1C1 3901. It was built in 1912 for the Chemins de fer du Midi and its Midi class was E 3200. It was one of six different prototype electric locomotives ordered by the Midi. It was withdrawn in 1959 and one motor from it is preserved.
Overview.
Many lines of the Midi network being mountain lines, the company began an electrification programme in 1909. The system chosen was single phase alternating current at 12 kV and 16⅔ Hz.
Six prototype locomotives were ordered for the Perpignan - Villefranche-de-Conflent line. They were:
Only the E 3201 really worked well. The company also ordered railcars E ABD 1 to 30, which later became Class Z 4900. 
Service.
The E 3201 worked throughout its career on the Perpignan - Villefranche-de-Conflent line for the haulage of freight trains, helped by the railcars. Thanks to its good reliability, it was kept by the SNCF when it was founded in 1938 and it remained in service until 1959.
Preservation.
E 3201 / 1C1 3901 was to be preserved but, owing to an act of vandalism, only one motor from the locomotive could be saved. It is exhibited at the Cité du Train, Mulhouse.

Real Groove was a New Zealand monthly music and pop culture magazine that operated from 1993 to 2010.&lt;ref name="RealGroove/RBP"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Based in Auckland, the publication began as a free newsletter distributed through Real Groovy Records. It became a newsstand title in the late 1990s and was subsequently owned by Tangible Media. In 2003, a survey by Nielsen Media Research showed a monthly readership comparable to "Rip It Up", New Zealand's leading music magazine.
"Real Groove" was first edited by John Dix, author of "". Subsequent editors included Nick Bollinger,&lt;ref name="Steel/witchdoctor"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; John Russell, Brock Oliver, Duncan Greive and Sam Wicks.&lt;ref name="Moses/Corner"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other writers whose work appeared in the magazine are Chris Bourke, Gary Steel,&lt;ref name="Fahy/StopPress"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Reid, former "Creem" music critic Richard Riegel, and Russell Brown.
The 196th and final issue of "Real Groove", dated October 2010, featured Leonard Cohen on the cover. The magazine had tried to focus on its online presence and, according to Wicks, the closure was due to "the lack of demand for physical publications". Among local media, its demise coincided with that of "Pulp" magazine, MTV's withdrawal from New Zealand, and Back2Basics merging with "Rip It Up".
"Real Groove" was amalgamated into "The Groove Guide", a free weekly magazine owned by Tangible Media.&lt;ref name="Satherley/Newshub"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; That title was similarly closed down, in May 2011.

Derry More

Derry More () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Derry More is bounded on the north by Derry Beg townland, on the west by Derryconnessy and Derrynaslieve townlands and on the east by Moneynure, Prospect, Corlough and Scrabby, Corlough townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, a stream and dug wells. Derry More is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 125 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Derrymore".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list twelve tithepayers in the townland.
The Derry More Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 38, being 13 males and 25 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 30, being 13 males and 17 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were five houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 24, being 9 males and 15 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are four families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland.

Agricultural expansion

Agricultural expansion describes the growth of agricultural land (arable land, pastures, etc.) in the 21st century.
The agricultural expansion is often explained as a direct consequence of the global increase in food and energy requirements due to continuing population growth (both which in turn have been attributed to agricultural expansion itself), with an estimated expectation of 10 to 11 billion humans on Earth by end of this century. It is foreseen that most of the world's non-agrarian ecosystems (terrestrial and aquatic) will be affected adversely, from habitat loss, land degradation, overexploitation, and other problems. The intensified food (and biofuel) production will in particular affect the tropical regions.
Most modern agriculture relies on intensive methods. Further expansion of the predominant farming types that rest on a small number of highly productive crops has led to a significant loss of biodiversity on a global scale already.
Moreover, agricultural expansion continues to be the main driver of deforestation and forest fragmentation. Large-scale commercial agriculture (primarily cattle ranching and cultivation of soya bean and oil palm) accounted for 40 percent of tropical deforestation between 2000 and 2010, and local subsistence agriculture for another 33 percent. In the light of the already occurring and potential massive ecological effects, the need for sustainable practices is more urgent than ever.
The FAO predicts that global arable land use will continue to grow from a in 2014 to in 2050, with most of this growth projected to result from developing countries. At the same time, arable land use in developed countries is likely to continue its decline.
A well-known example of already ongoing agricultural expansion is the proliferation of palm oil production areas or the land conversion/deforestation for soy bean production in South America. Today's land grabbing activities are often a consequence of the strive for agricultural land by growing economies.
In the beginning of the 21st century the palm oil industry caused a massive deforestation in Borneo with heavy consequences.

Woodside, Old Windsor

Woodside is a large detached house with of gardens in Old Windsor, Berkshire, on the edge of Windsor Great Park. The house has been rebuilt several times since the 18th century. The Rococo gardens of Woodside were laid out in the mid-18th century and depicted by the artist Thomas Robins the Elder. The gardens were subsequently redesigned under Rosemary Verey and Roy Strong in the 1980s and 1990s. Woodside has been the home of the musician Sir Elton John since 1975.
History.
Woodside was originally built in the 1500s for Henry VIII's surgeon, the site chosen so that the occupant could be summoned by an emergency flag flown at Windsor Castle. The house subsequently burnt down and has been rebuilt three times, most recently in 1947 in a style described as "post war mock Georgian". At the time of Woodside's 1989 refurbishment the house consisted of eight bedrooms, five reception rooms, a billiard room, and a squash court in of grounds.
18th century.
In 1752 Hugh Hammersley acquired Woodside upon his marriage to Ann Clark. By 1755 Hammersley had rebuilt the house in the fashionable Gothic revival style and laid out extensive plantings of shrubberies and flower gardens around the property. Hammersley's Rococo gardens at Woodside were captured in three paintings by Thomas Robins the Elder, including a 'Chinese kiosk', an early example of chinoiserie which was inspired by the Chinese Pavilion at Kew Gardens. Robins's paintings are the only evidence for the composition of Woodside's gardens in the 18th century.
A broadside ballad of the 1750s in the English Broadside Ballad Archive collated by the University of California, Santa Barbara recounts the tale of a 'human monster' who resided at Woodside who had been "noted for the infamous feat of eating a cat alive" and that he had been "apprehended and committed to gaol, on a charge of murdering an infant six years old".
19th century.
Woodside was the home of John Ramsbottom (1778–1845), Member of Parliament for New Windsor between 1810 and 1845. The 1828 "Visitants' guide to Windsor castle and its vicinity" described Woodside as "having a very commanding appearance", surrounded by a "handsome park", and noted that it was "situated on the gentle declivity of a hill stretching from the Great Park to the Thames". According to the guide, the house was built during the reign of King George II.
Woodside was advertised for sale in "The Times" in July 1849 through Messrs Daniel Smith and Sons. The advertisement described a "substantial mansion of the Elizabethan style of architecture" situated in a small park "studded with venerable old oaks and other valuable timber". The estate was listed at including a small farm, "walled gardens, beautiful pleasure rounds, a conservatory, an ornamental cottage residence and farmhouse buildings".
It was purchased at that time by the merchant William Devas, and was therefore the childhood home of the political economist Charles Stanton Devas.
20th century.
Colonel William Webb Follett died at Woodside in April 1926. His widow, Lady Julia Alice Kennedy, daughter of The 2nd Marquess of Ailsa, lived on at the house until her death in December 1936. A fire at the house in April 1928 considerably damaged woodwork and paneling dating back to the time of James II, and a 'large and historic old fireplace' had to be demolished to make way for the fire services. A wooden beam that had been 'smouldering for weeks' was believed to be the cause. Lady Julia's obituary in "The Times" wrote of her that "She never used a telephone or drove in a car, and her house, the largest in the village, was lit with oil lamps".
Elton John.
Since 1975 the house has been the principal residence of the English musician and composer Sir Elton John. John also owns an apartment in Atlanta, Georgia, a villa near Nice on the French Cote d'Azur and a house in London's Holland Park district. John bought the house for £400,000 in 1974 (£ at current prices) and subsequently brought in his collections of what the music writer Mick Brown described as 'High Rock'n'Roll Empire', including "jukeboxes and pinball machines; Tiffany lamps and art deco nymphs; red leather sofas; the odd Rembrandt etching; a disco; [and] a replica of Tutankhamun's state throne". The house also stored John's many costumes from his tours and the Doc Marten boots that he wore in the 1975 film "Tommy". The contents of the house were subsequently sold at auction for $8.2 million at a 2,000-item four-day sale at Sotheby's in September 1988. John decided to refurbish and redesign Woodside after overcoming drink and drug addictions in the late 1980s, feeling that he "didn't want to be a middle-aged man who was a parody of his younger self" and that the house contained "a lot of kitsch ...it was more of an Aladdin's cave than a home."
The subsequent redesign and refurbishment of the house was begun in 1989 and took three years. It was carried out by Adrian Cooper-Grigg and Andrew Protheroe, with the proviso that they should attempt to create an English country house that resembled the seat of a well established family with their objects accumulated over successive generations. Protheroe said that John "wanted it to look like something that had evolved ...something that had happened instead of being contrived"; the pair consequently acquired many antiques and objets d'art. Brown described the interior decoration on his 2010 visit as consisting of "capacious sofas – an aura of Aubusson, cut moquette, damask – and deep carpets. There are vases spilling with flowers, elaborately carved tables, every surface covered with exquisite porcelain." The restrictions on building materials after the Second World War meant that Woodside's ceilings are comparatively low at only , and to increase the perceived height of the rooms Cooper-Grigg and Protheroe added columns and mouldings and allowed draperies to pool on the floor.
The indoor swimming pool was redesigned to resemble an ancient Roman bath and the front entrance was designed to highlight the enfilade that centres on a gazebo and waterfall in the gardens. A shell room was created with conches and cockle shells over a four-month period. An 18th-century orangery at the end of the drive was restored in the late 1990s. Viscount Linley designed a marquetry screen that surrounds the bed in the master bedroom, and a chest of drawers in which some of John's collection of hundreds of spectacles are kept. John's archive of 70,000 CDs is housed next to the gym.
Woodside is the site of The White Tie and Tiara Ball, an annual charitable ball held to raise money for the Elton John AIDS Foundation.

The main house is hung with mainly 18th- and 19th-century paintings, including works by Helen Allingham, Arthur Devis, Thomas Gainsborough, Henry Scott Tuke, and watercolours by Edward Lear.
A former garage block situated at the rear of the main house has been redesigned as a purpose-built art gallery; it stands between the main house and Woodside's tennis court. It was designed by the architect Jack Schneider and was completed in 2009. One wall of the gallery is clad in copper, with another featuring a running waterfall. The mezzanine level of the gallery is home to a large library of art books. The writer Mick Brown described entering the gallery as "like stepping into an adjunct" of the Tate Modern. The gallery contains a large tapestry of John by Chuck Close given as a present by Close for John's 60th birthday, as well as pieces by Louise Bourgeois, Jake and Dinos Chapman, Gilbert and George, Antony Gormley, Andreas Gursky, Damien Hirst, Philip Taaffe, and a self-portrait by Gillian Wearing.
Gardens.
The present gardens at Woodside were laid out in the late 1980s by the garden designers Gordon Taylor and Guy Cooper under the direction of Rosemary Verey. Verey's biographer, Barbara Paul Robinson, felt that working for John with his large annual expenditure on Woodside was a welcome change for her since she had become used to clients who complained about costs. After being contacted by John's personal assistant in 1987, Verey recalled the name 'Woodside' from Robins's 18th-century paintings of the Rococo garden, and found a limited edition of a book featuring the paintings, which she presented to John. Verey was asked for a detailed garden plan for Woodside at short notice in 1988, and enlisted the help of Taylor and Cooper as she had no garden staff of her own. She described herself as an 'advisor' on the garden project, which involved detailed minuted meetings with landscape designers, architects and full-time gardeners. A water garden at Woodside with spouting fountains, large 'overflowing' flowering pots and scented borders was inspired by the Generalife gardens of the Alhambra in Granada. Verey claimed credit for its creation against the wishes of other gardeners; it is not clear who is responsible for its creation.
Verey initially planted and helped develop a white garden, a rainbow border (nicknamed the Ribbon Borders) inspired by Gertrude Jekyll, a scented garden, and an 18th-century garden at Woodside. The drive toward the main entrance of the house is lined with white rose bushes. Verey's white garden at Woodside was inspired by the white garden at the Sissinghurst Castle Garden, designed by Vita Sackville-West. Verey toured the gardens of Woodside in her BBC documentary "The English Country Garden", broadcast in October 1996. The art historian and garden designer Sir Roy Strong created a classical Italian garden for John, at the behest of John's friend the fashion designer Gianni Versace. Strong had previously created gardens for Versace at his homes in Lake Como and Florida, the Villa Fontanelle, and the Casa Casuarina, respectively. The creation of Strong's Italian garden of scarlet geraniums and boxwood necessitated the moving of Verey's white garden, which upset her. Verey complained to friends saying that if John had wanted an Italian garden, "then why didn't he buy a house in Italy?!" and wrote that "Sadly (for me), Elton decided he wanted an Italian garden so after six years my white garden has gone and statues and vistas have taken over. I wonder, does an Italian garden blend with and complement an English Regency house?". John's head gardener, Helen Finch, maintained the gardens. Verey later attended John's 50th birthday at Woodside dressed as the rainbow border.
Various follies are scattered in the garden, including a red telephone kiosk and a red post box. In the woodland, a life-size fiberglass "Tyrannosaurus" named Daisy has eyes which light up when people pass by. Daisy was moved into the woodland by helicopter when the gardens were redesigned; she was a present to John from Ringo Starr (other sources say George Harrison or Paul McCartney). A folly in the garden resembling nearby Windsor Castle was constructed as a stable for John's donkeys and pony during the late 1980s renovations.
The gardens are also home to a former W2-class Melbourne tram (No. 520) which John imported from Australia in the 1980s in what he described as one of "my drug-induced moments", stating in a 2010 interview that the tram cost "Ten thousand to buy it. And a million to ship it over".
The gardens of Woodside also contain an organic vegetable garden; one of John's pumpkins from the garden won third prize at a horticultural show. In 1997 the garden was maintained by a head gardener and five full-time gardeners. The gardens were the subject of the 1997 book "Elton John's Flower Fantasies: An Intimate Tour of his House and Garden" by Caroline Cass.

Xocia's Dance

Xocia's Dance is the thirteenth studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land as band leader. The album was initially released in 1981 via Muse Records label and re-released on CD in 1990.
Reception.
Stephen Cook of Allmusic wrote "Maybe best known for his 1959 Contemporary album The Fox, tenor saxophonist Harold Land spent the '50s and '60s rebuking the stereotype of the West Coast sound being all wafer-thin with his robust and intense work as both a solo artist and sideman. And while he slowed down a bit in the '70s, Land came roaring back with this exceptional effort from 1981. Both the playing and the songs are all top notch. To help out, Land enlists the fine talents of drummer Billy Higgins, vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, pianist George Cables, trumpeter Oscar Brashear, and bassist John Heard. Highly recommended."

Malla Samuelsen

Malene (Malla) Sofie Samuelsen née Poulsen (11 July 1909 – 29 November 1997) was a Faroese politician and feminist who became the first woman to sit in the Løgting, the Faroese parliament, when she served for a short period as a substitute in 1964. She was also one of the founders of the Faroese Women's Association ("Kvinnufelagið"), frequently serving as its chair.
Biography.
Born on 11 July 1909 in Kirkja on the easterly island of Fugloy, Malene Sofie Poulsen was the daughter of the fisherman Petur Pauli Poulsen (1881–1957) and his wife Susanne Elisabeth Zachariasen (1885–1919). One of seven children, after her mother died when she was eight, she was brought up by her maternal grandparents. Her grandfather, Símun Mikkjal Zachariasen, was a poet, politician and schoolteacher who played an active part in Faroese cultural life.
When she was 16, Poulsen moved to Tórshavn where she took care of the house where her uncle and brother lived while attending college. A couple of years later, she went to Copenhagen where she worked as a housemaid. When she was 35 she married a Danish sailor, Carl Niklas Samuelsen, and set up house in Tórshavn. They had two children together. Like many of her compatriots, she was often left alone when her husband was away at sea.
In 1952, Samuelsen was one of those who founded the Faroese women's association "Kvinnufelagið í Havn". She was a board member for many years, sometimes the association's chair. She supported the association's goals of improving the political, economic and cultural roles of women. As the political parties showed little interest in having women members, the association set its own agenda, successfully having several women elected to the Tórshavn city council in 1956. Samuelsen, representing the Sjálvstýrisflokkurin party, was among them. She served on a number of committees involved in social services and education, and was re-elected in 1960. In 1964, acting for a short period as a substitute, she became the first woman to sit in the Faroese parliament. It was not until 1978 that the first women, Jona Henriksen and Karin Kjølbro, were officially elected to the Løgting.
In 1965, Samuelsen was appointed head of the Tórshavn old peoples home where she remained for 13 years. She died in Tórshavn on 29 November 1997.

Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, Brisbane

Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre is a heritage-listed former military building at 9 Lambert Road, Indooroopilly, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1942 to 1943 by Queensland Main Roads Commission. It is also known as Allied Translator and Interpreter Section headquarters, Northern Command Provost Company headquarters, and Witton Barracks. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016.
History.
Three brick and timber cell blocks (), and their related former exercise yard, located at 9 Lambert Street, Indooroopilly, Brisbane, are the last surviving purpose-built elements of the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, which was the headquarters of the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS) from late 1942 to mid-1945. The facility was the only purpose-built World War II (WWII) interrogation centre for POWs in Australia. The later Q-Store and Office building (), and a Motorized Transport Cover () were purpose-built infrastructure for the Australian Army's Northern Command Provost (military police) unit that occupied the site from 1951 to .
Brisbane became an important supply base for the war in the Pacific after Japan entered World War II in December 1941. US General Douglas MacArthur, formally appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the South-West Pacific Area (SWPA) theatre on 18 April 1942, moved his General Headquarters (GHQ) SWPA from Melbourne to Brisbane on 20 July 1942, to prepare for a counter-offensive against the Japanese. The Imperial Japanese Navy had lost a number of aircraft carriers, and therefore much of its offensive strength, in the Battle of the Coral Sea (May 1942) and the Battle of Midway (June 1942); and during September 1942 the Imperial Japanese Army would be defeated, for the first time in the Pacific War, at the Battle of Milne Bay and on the Kokoda Track in Papua. As a result of these land battles, Japanese prisoners were sent back to Australia from September 1942. The first Japanese documents had been captured in an Australian commando raid on Salamaua, New Guinea, on 29 June 1942.
The Australian Military Forces (AMF, or Army) had begun Japanese language training in Melbourne in 1940, and Australian Japanese linguists were later sent to the Australian Advanced Land Headquarters, Brisbane, established by General Thomas Blamey (Allied Land Forces Commander) at the University of Queensland at St Lucia in August 1942. The large two storey timber residence Tighnabruaich, on of land on the bank of the Brisbane River at Indooroopilly, was requisitioned by the AMF on 17 August 1942, Requests for repairs and additions to the two residences on the site (Tighnabruaich and Witton House) also occurred in August 1942 and the Australians established the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre there in early September 1942.
The site of the Interrogation Centre was once the estate of Henry Charles Stanley, Chief Engineer for Railways in Queensland, who built Tighnabruaich . Mr and Mrs HC Stanley were apparently living at Indooroopilly by early 1890. but Stanley did not purchase the site of Tighnabruiach until June 1891, and is first recorded as living in "Tighnabruaich" in January 1893. Tighnabruaich was designed by Henry's brother, the former Colonial Architect, Francis Drummond Greville Stanley. Development at Indooroopilly was limited until the Brisbane to Ipswich railway line opened to the locality in 1875. Indooroopilly developed as an elite suburb in the late 19th century, and a number of large villas, including Tighnabruaich, were later erected on the banks of the Brisbane River. Stanley lived at Tighnabruaich until . In 1871 there was a population of 497 at Moggill, but only 286 at Indooroopilly. A railway bridge was constructed over the Brisbane River from Indooroopilly to Chelmer in 1876. An 1860s timber residence, Witton House, was moved onto the southwest corner of the Tighnabruaich estate by a later owner, Herbert Brealey Hemming, around 1915-16. After Hemming died on 8 March 1942 the estate was administered by Queensland Trustees Limited. The original site of Witton House (previously called Witton Manor) was upstream at what is Ambrose Treacy College in 2016. The McConnel family, of Cressbrook Station, bought Witton Manor in the early 1870s.
On 19 September 1942, the Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS), a joint US-Australian unit, was formed by MacArthur's Chief Intelligence Officer, Brigadier-General Charles A. Willoughby, and established its headquarters at the Interrogation Centre. McNaughton states that the ATIS "replaced" the Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre, but the Tighnabruaich property was later purchased by the Commonwealth for the Interrogation Centre. The ATIS was one of a number of intelligence organisations developed by General MacArthur's GHQ from April 1942 onwards, including the Central Bureau (code breaking), the Allied Geographical Section (terrain intelligence), Order of Battle Section (for information on enemy units), and the Allied Intelligence Bureau (AIB: propaganda, intelligence gathering, and commando raids or guerrilla warfare in Japanese-occupied territory). An AIB facility was established at the former site of Witton Manor, now the site of Ambrose Treacy College 
The ATIS initially consisted of 14 Australian officers and three enlisted men, and nine US personnel. The latter included one Caucasian officer and eight Japanese American (Nisei) enlisted men who had completed a Japanese language course at the US Fourth Army Intelligence School in San Francisco on 1 May 1942; and who had arrived in Australia in June 1942. The American-born Nisei, whose families were removed from the US West Coast in early 1942 due to fears about the loyalty of Japanese Americans, were to prove invaluable to the Allied War effort. "The Nisei learned to use their knowledge of Japanese culture and psychology to elicit information through indirect questioning. They discovered that compassionate treatment worked wonders. Their captives, expecting torture and death, were at first astonished, then grateful. Any recalcitrant prisoner needed only to hear that authorities would notify his family ... that he had been captured alive. The implied disgrace could usually convince him to co-operate". The first Nisei combat units were formed in the US in early 1943, thanks to the earlier work of the Nisei translators in demonstrating their loyalty and effectiveness.
The ATIS was formed into four units, with the Nisei attached to GHQ; the other sections were Allied Naval Forces, Allied Land Forces, and Allied Air Forces, and all were accommodated at the Tighnabruaich property. The Tighnabruaich residence was used for senior officers' accommodation and offices, while Witton House became the Sergeants' mess. The Nisei enlisted men soon moved into tents at a property directly across the river (Neilson House on Rosebery Terrace, since demolished).
The ATIS headquarters at Tighnabruaich became the primary interrogation centre for enemy POWs in Australia. Other POW sites in Australia were POW Camps for large numbers of prisoners, whereas the cell blocks at the Interrogation Centre were built as temporary holding cells for small numbers of POWs awaiting interrogation.
With a capacity to accommodate 15 prisoners, the three cell blocks, in a compound surrounded by barbed wire, were constructed in late 1942-early 1943. Each of the blocks included five cells linked by an adjacent passageway running the length of the block, and two ancillary rooms in a section on the opposite side of the passageway. Based on a 1958 inventory of room contents, the larger ancillary room (with a hot water cylinder) was probably a guard room, and the smaller a bathroom.
The construction of the cell blocks was kept a closely guarded secret. An Allied Works Council (AWC) meeting in early December 1942 merely noted a requisition for £2000 of alterations and additions to "three premises" at "ATIS Indooroopilly". The work was allocated to Mr Holt, Supervising Engineer of the Bridge Board, with the order lodged on the Main Roads Commission and a time of completion of six weeks. The project "Indooroopilly, GHQ, 3 special buildings" was also included in a list of requisitions to January 1943, with the handwritten annotation "Detailed Interrogation Centre". A Department of the Army minute paper from late January 1943 reported that "brick buildings of substantial design are being erected at Indooroopilly...for the Department of the Army on a site adjoining the railway station" with a hand written annotation noting that "this is the ATIS GHQ project for interrogation". A later minute paper stated that "the project referred to is an urgent vital operational one, comprising brick buildings erected to special designs produced by an overseas officer for the purpose of housing a GHQ Centre, and is of such a highly secret nature that only a very few senior intelligence officers were permitted to view the plans".
The prisoners at the Interrogation Centre were held under tight security. The POWs in the cell blocks were guarded by troops from the Australian 1st Garrison Battalion, and were sent to the Interrogation Centre from the Gaythorne POW Transit Camp. "A small, dirt exercise yard was located within the barbed wire enclosure. There was only one Entry Point into the Prisoners" Compound. POWs were marched through one barbed wire gate into a small holding pen. They remained inside this pen until one gate was closed and locked. Then the other gate was opened to allow them to either exit or enter the Prisoners' Compound'. The Gaythorne camp (now replaced by housing) was located south of today's Bliss Street, Gaythorne, to the south and west of the south end of Newman Street. It included a block with 6 cells in a detention compound, located southeast of the south end of Ernest Street. The presence of Japanese POWs so near to Brisbane homes was kept a secret from locals. Once interrogation was completed, the POWs were returned to Gaythorne prior to being placed on a train and sent to POW Camps in New South Wales or Victoria. There was one death of a POW at the Interrogation Centre in 1943, when Private Kingo Yamashita of the Imperial Japanese Army hung himself in his cell after interrogation.
POWs of other nationalities were also questioned at the Interrogation Centre. These included German crew members of the blockade-runner "MV Ramses" (a cargo ship attempting to deliver rubber from Japan to German-occupied France), scuttled in the Indian Ocean by HMAS Adelaide on 28 November 1942; and the submarine U-168, sunk in the Indian Ocean on 6 October 1944. Interrogation of captured Indonesians, or translation of documents written in the Malay languages of the East Indies, was undertaken by the Netherlands East Indies Forces Intelligence Service (NEFIS).
In its first month of operation the ATIS, which was a polyglot unit including Americans, Australians, Canadians, British, Chinese, White Russians, and East Indies Netherlanders, processed 1000 captured Japanese documents, translated 90, and interrogated seven prisoners, the first Japanese POWs (captured at Normanby Island near Milne Bay) reaching Brisbane on 30 September 1942. The ATIS released its first spot report on 1 November. By 27 December 1942, Allied units in New Guinea had sent back 1100 documents for translation, and during the war the ATIS produced research reports on various topics, including war crimes.
Other important work conducted by ATIS translators at the Interrogation Centre included the breaking of the Japanese Army's codes in 1943 (after the capture of codebooks from the Japanese Army's 20th Division) and the translation of a captured Japanese officers' list that allowed the Allies to compile a Japanese Order of Battle. In May 1944, a captured Japanese plan ('Z' Plan) for concentrating the Japanese Combined Fleet for a decisive final battle with the US Pacific Fleet, assisted by land-based aircraft, was translated at the Interrogation Centre just before the Battle of the Philippine Sea in June 1944. The largest aircraft carrier battle in history, it was won by the US, with crippling losses of Japanese aircraft.
The cell blocks are the only remaining purpose-built elements of the Interrogation Centre. Wartime site plans do not show the buildings within the prisoners' compound. One plan states the "Plans of buildings within compound are secret and unobtainable. Buildings are partly of brick". By April 1944 the complex had a prisoners' compound, east of Witton House; four "Masonite huts" south of Witton House, and eight along the boundary with the railway line, north of Witton House; a former stable just east of the prisoners' compound, used as a QM (Quartermaster's) store; four OR (Other Ranks) quarters northeast of the prisoners' compound, with showers and latrines to the northeast of the quarters, a mess hall and kitchen to the west, and ablutions and latrines to the south; a car ramp and petrol store further north near Lambert Road; an orderly room northwest of the circular driveway to Tighnabruaich; a translating building southeast of the driveway (built over tennis courts); plus a building just west of Tighnabruaich (possibly the interrogation building), and five buildings east of Tighnabruaich and the translating building. Of the WWII buildings at the facility, only the cell blocks were made of brick.
More buildings were added, and some were removed, between 1944 and 1946. The layout of the prisoner's compound - with three cell blocks, two small buildings to the north and one small building to the southwest - is visible in a 1946 aerial. By this time the Masonite huts had gone; there was a new building south of the QM store, and there were three additional buildings east of Tighnabruaich and the translating building. The buildings of the prisoners' compound are finally shown on a 1948 plan. The latter shows that by 1948 small lean-to porches existed at the north end of the western section of the western (north and central) cell blocks; and at the west end of the southern section of the southern cell block. All of the WWII additions to the site, apart from the three cell blocks, were gradually removed by the late 1950s. A plan indicates that some WWII buildings had already been removed. More were sold in 1957-58 (NAA: J56, QL470: "Indooroopilly - ex-interrogation centre - Tignabruiach. Wilton House - Residence Northern Command" (1943-1958)), and all were gone by 1959. Although the plan is labelled "Indooroopilly barracks", this term does not seem to be used in any other files or plans from the 1950s to the 1970s.
The Interrogation Centre was officially acquired by the Australian Government on 26 April 1945, Ownership was transferred to the Commonwealth on 13 June, registered 7 January 1946 and subsequently a variety of military units were accommodated there. In July, the ATIS left and until the end of the war the site was the barracks for No.2 Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), which was transferred from St Peter's Lutheran College on Indooroopilly Road. The site was then used as barracks for No.7 AWAS until July 1946, and was used as a personnel depot until 1949.
There were some changes to the use of the cell blocks in the immediate post-war period. An inventory of buildings at the former Interrogation Centre, dated December 1950, noted that the western (north) cell block was used as a Sergeants' mess, while the other two blocks were still cells. All cell blocks were by , while the western (north) block also had a small by timber annex (south of the western section).
In January 1951 Tighnabruaich became the official residence of the General of Command (GOC), Northern Command, Australian Army (later Commander 1st Division) - the house serving in this capacity until 1998. During this period a tradition was established whereby each resident general planted a tree on the property. In 1960 Northern Command, which was headquartered at Victoria Barracks in Brisbane, covered Queensland, some of northern New South Wales, and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea.
The Northern Command's Provost Platoon was also based at the former Interrogation Centre from 1951, with the WWII cell blocks being reused as a detention barracks. Instead of POWs, they would now hold Australian soldiers. Provost (military police) units supervised disciplinary regulations and also provided traffic control for other military units. After WWII the Australian Provost Corps had been reduced to one platoon in each of Queensland, Victoria and NSW, plus some units involved in the occupation of Japan. AMF military detention barracks in Queensland (including Grovely, Warwick and Charters Towers) were disbanded, and by 1948 Queensland's Northern Command Provost Platoon only held prisoners for short periods before they were transferred to Eastern Command detention barracks in NSW. It was renamed 1 Military Police Company in 1974.
However, the re-introduction of National Service in the 1951 meant that the provost platoons were expanded to company strength. Previous National Service schemes had operated from 1911–29 and 1939-1945, and the third National Service Scheme, initiated by the National Service Act 1951, was a result of the Cold War and conflict in South East Asia and Korea. The first call-up notice for compulsory military training of males turning 18 on or after 1 November 1950 was issued in April 1951. Between 1951 and the scheme's termination in 1959, 227,000 men were trained. A fourth National Service Scheme operated from 1964-72 with more than 63,000 men were conscripted, and over 19,000 served in Vietnam. The Provosts were kept busy dealing with offences by National Servicemen, and the Northern Command Provost Platoon was expanded to company strength in 1955.
A number of changes occurred to the former Interrogation Centre site during its use by the Provost Company. By 1958 the western (north) cell block was a lecture room and gymnasium, with four rooms, a passageway and the timber annex (for a water closet), while the other cell blocks retained their original layout of two ancillary rooms, a passageway and five cells. All three cell blocks were described as having hardwood and brick frames; concrete foundations and floors; walls of brick and tongue &amp; groove vertical joint pine; caneite ceilings; and a corrugated asbestos cement roof. Linings in the western (north) cell block were hardboard and plywood; with brick, caneite, plywood and hardboard partitions; while the other two cell blocks had linings of plywood and partitions of brick and plywood. The location of timber annex to western (north) cell block is discernible in a 1948 plan.
New buildings were also added to the Provost headquarters at the former Interrogation Centre, the first being three prefabricated Riley Newsum residences, completed in 1952 and used as married quarters: two on the Lambert Road frontage of the site, and one on Clarence Street, east of the translating building. The married quarters buildings were later removed between 1997 and 2001. The translating building was removed in the 1950s, and its site reverted to being a tennis court.
Two more buildings (extant in 2016) were added to the Provost headquarters , forming a complex around the perimeter of the former POW exercise yard, which at some point was sealed with bitumen as a parade ground. The two new buildings are not on a September 1959 aerial, but are present on a December 1960 aerial photographs. The arrangement of buildings around a central parade ground is a characteristic of Australian Army barracks. One building was a Q-store (Quartermaster's store) and Office, built north of the exercise yard. This had a Q-Store at the west end, a security room (possibly a secure room for the Q-Store) and duty room (guard room), orderly room (administration office), investigation AWOL section, and rooms for the OC (Officer Commanding) and RSM (Regimental Sergeant Major) at the east end. In 1961 the Q-Store, highset on brick piers, was described as being , with a corrugated galvanised iron roof; brick walls; hardwood and concrete floors; cement rendered lining; hardboard, brick and louvre partitions, and hardboard and FAC (Flat Asbestos Cement?) ceilings.
The second building was a Motor Transport (MT) Cover, constructed to the east of the exercise yard. It included an office and store room at the north end, 12 vehicle bays, and an oil store room at the south end. In 1961 the building was described as being , with concrete foundations and floor; brick walls; hardwood posts; galvanised iron cliplock roof; some cement rendered lining; and some hardboard ceiling. Australia's Provost units initially used US Jeeps and Harley Davidson motorcycles after WWII, then later British Austin Champs and Land Rovers, and BSA B40 motorcycles.
A further addition was made to the Provost headquarters in 1967, when Witton House was demolished and replaced with a new two-storey brick Provost Company barracks (extant in 2016). The stained glass entrance fanlight from "Witton House" was included in the northern first floor entrance of the new barracks, which was officially opened in February 1968. The fanlight was removed by the military sometime prior to 2016.
There were other changes made to the complex in the 1960s and 1970s. Between 1961 and 1969 a new (brick) annex was built south of the western section of the western (north) cell block; and between 1969 and 1974 a new building (not extant in 2016) was located on the parade ground, running west–east near the western cell blocks. On a plan this is labelled an SIB (Special Investigations Branch) office. This was replaced by a steel-framed maintenance workshop, located east of and parallel to the western (north) cell block, (extant 2016). By 1974 the western (north) cell block was being used as a Q-Store, with the 1959-60 Q-store being used as offices. Between 1974 and 1997 a brick extension, for a strong room, was added to the north end of the western (north) cell block. Also in 1974, a timber interwar residence (not extant) was relocated from the Kelvin Grove Military Reserve to face Clarence Road to the east of Tighnabruaich. By 1979 the Provost headquarters was called "Witton Barracks".
Between 1951 and the 1980s the former Interrogation Centre had become "the major military police barracks in Queensland", and "to a large degree the area [had] been purpose-built as a military police installation". By 1979 there were two military police units based at the former Interrogation Centre, to provide support to Divisional units and the Military District, and to prevent, detect and investigate crimes within the army. The units totalled 112 personnel, 39 vehicles and 25 motorcycles, and the western (central) cell block was being used for "additional storage and office accommodation". There was a barrack block (the 1967 barracks) with accommodation and dining rooms for 22 all ranks, and a 16-man barrack block was being used as an office (presumably the 1970s SIB office). Tighnabruaich was now the residence of the Commander of the 1st Division, and the residence moved to the site in 1974 was used by the Commander of the 1st Military District.
The use of Witton Barracks by the military police declined from 1984. In January that year the facility was occupied by the 1 Military Police Company, and 9 Military Police Company, with 110 full-time and 52 half-time staff. However, 1 Military Police Company moved to new barracks accommodation at Enoggera in April 1984, and Witton Barracks was reduced to 30 full-time staff. In January 1981, 11 Military Police Platoon and 13 Military Police Platoon, from Sydney and Townsville respectively, had been relocated to Indooroopilly.
Later the Queensland University Regiment (an officer training unit of the Australian Army Reserve) took over use of Witton Barracks, occupying it until . No structures of cultural heritage significance were added to the former Interrogation Centre during this period.
In 1998, a block of land containing Tighnabruaich, and a block around the Clarence Road residence, were subdivided from Witton Barracks and sold, reducing the site to .
In 2016 the remainder of Witton Barracks was purchased by the Brisbane City Council. At that time the three WWII cell blocks survived at the former Interrogation Centre, along with the Q-Store and MT Cover, the 1967 barracks block, and the 1980s steel-framed workshop. The barracks block and 1980s workshop are not considered to be of cultural heritage significance.
Description.
In 2016 the former Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre occupies a irregular-shaped terraced site, located on the northern bank of the Brisbane River in the suburb of Indooroopilly, Brisbane. The property is bounded by Lambert Street (north), a railway reserve (west), the Brisbane River (south), and residential properties (east), including Tighnabruaich. The area immediately around the former defence buildings, in the southern half of the site, is terraced, stepping up from west to east; and is accessed and set well back from Lambert Street to the north. The defence buildings are organised around a bitumen parade ground (previously a POW exercise yard) and includes a southern cell block (1942–43), two western cell blocks (central, 1942–43; northern, 1942–43), a northwestern Quartermaster's Store and Office (Q-Store; ) and an eastern Motorised Transport (MT) Cover ().
Cell Blocks (1942-43).
The three cell blocks are of the same original design. Standing on a sloping site, the buildings step down from the southern cell block to the western (north) cell block. The buildings are all lowset, one storey, brick and timber structures, with corrugated metal-clad hip roofs, and spaced timber board eaves linings. They are approximately rectangular in plan. Most walls are facebrick, with the exception of those in the southwestern (western cell blocks) and southeastern (southern cell block) corners of the buildings, which are single-skin with external V-jointed (VJ) timber board cladding and internally exposed timber stud framing.
Each cell block originally comprised five cells, off a long passageway running the length of the building. On the opposite side of the passageway, and occupying almost half the length of each cell block, were two ancillary rooms - a bathroom and a (possible) guard room - and a lean-to entry porch. Most cells have brick walls, wide plaster cornices and wide concrete skirtings. The guard rooms and bathrooms generally have painted brick walls, narrow timber cornices and are free of skirting boards. Ceilings throughout all three of the blocks are recent plaster over VJ boards, and the floors are concrete slabs (some covered with recent linings).
Timber joinery is retained throughout the buildings, including timber-framed fixed louvre and awning windows. Most cells have a timber-framed, fixed timber louvre window, with vertical steel bars to the interior; and most windows to the guard room/bathroom sections have interior metal security grates.
Features not of cultural heritage significance include painted finishes to brickwork, tile and linoleum floor linings, flat sheeting lining some cell walls, fibre cement sheeting, modern bathroom fixtures, plywood boarding over windows and doors, wire mesh screens, and metal barred screens.
Southern Cell Block.
The southern cell block is orientated on an east–west axis, and its floor level is aligned with the parade ground. The building is accessed via a ground-level footpath to the east and from a timber stair to the west, which both open into the long central passageway.
The facebrick walls of the cells have rough mortar joints, and above each cell door in the passageway is a painted number, listed from one to five (east to west). The entry porch has recently been enclosed with fibre cement sheeting (enclosing fabric is not of significance).
Metal grill doors secure the entrance to the building and each of the cells and retain original hardware including a locking device (lever) at the eastern entrance that connects to all the cell door locks.
Western (Central) Cell Block.
Aligned on a north–south axis, the western (central) cell block stands downhill from the parade ground. It is accessed from a footpath to the south, a small concrete stair to the north and an entry porch to the northwest. A shade house (not of significance) is attached to the southern elevation.
Most of the cell walls and their skirtings have been painted. A large wall opening has been cut between the second- and third-most northern cells. The southern cell is lined with modern flat sheeting, which is aligned with the skirtings and has wide, rectangular cover strips.
The timber cell doors have metal grill observation openings at eye level. A metal locking mechanism running above the doors is retained.
Western (North) Cell Block.
The western (north) cell block is orientated on a north–south axis and its floor-level is slightly lower than that of the western (central) cell block. It is accessed from a footpath to the south and via the northwestern entry porch; the number 47 is painted above the entry porch's doorway. A single story, brick, skillion-roofed annex has been added to the southwest corner of the building; and a brick, skillion roofed strong room has been added north of the cells.
While walls that separated the four northernmost cells have been removed, stubs projecting from the eastern and western walls mark their former locations, enabling the original layout to be legible. A lightweight partition has replaced the original wall separating the southernmost cells, and includes a door and a low rectangular opening. All cell walls have been lined with recent flat sheeting (aligned with the skirtings) and finished with wide, rectangular cover strips. The cell windows do not have their original bars or timber louvres. The walls of the guard room/bathroom section are lined with flat sheeting with rounded cover strips. The two-room annex addition has painted brick and VJ timber board-lined walls.
VJ timber-lined boarded doors are located at the northern and southern entrances, within the annex and to the southern cell. Most cell doors are modern replacements and some have been removed completely.
Quartermaster's Store and Office (Q-Store, ).
The Quartermaster's Store and Office (Q-Store) is rectangular in plan and is orientated to face northwest, with its main floor highset on the northwest elevation but level with the parade ground on its southeast elevation. The building is one-storey, cavity brick structure; supported on brick piers and sheltered by a corrugated metal-clad gable roof. All external walls are facebrick. The main entrances to the building are via a northwestern verandah, with additional access from the rear (southeast) - at ground level (eastern end) and via a concrete stair (western end).
Internally, the building is divided into two sections - offices to the northeast and store to the southwest - that are separated by a central Duty Room (north, entered via the verandah) and Security Office (south, entered through the store section). The office section is entered from the north through a central public corridor, which provides access to a northeastern Officer Commanding (OC) Office and northwestern Investigation Absent Without Leave (AWOL) Section Office; and terminates at a southwestern Orderly Room. A smaller corridor in the northern corner of the Orderly Room provides access to a southeastern Regimental Sergeant Major (RSM) Office, and a second door to the OC Office. The store section reads as its original, singular space with a timber partition west of the entrance door, although has recent, lightweight office partitions. All external walls are internally lined with plaster, and interior walls are lined with flat sheeting with rounded cover strips. All ceilings are lined with flat sheeting with rounded cover strips, and the timber floor boards are almost completely covered in modern linings. Marks in the floor lining at the entrance to the store section are indicative of the former location of a service counter.
The verandah has a concrete floor and a raked ceiling lined in flat sheets. It has metal circular posts with metal post-and-rail balustrades, and concrete stairs to the east and west.
The sub-floor area is accessible from the southwest. It is divided into three sections of the same proportions as the building's interior and verandah, with facebrick piers and walls dividing the spaces. A concrete plinth is located at the eastern end of the southwestern section.
Early timber joinery has been retained and includes casement and awning windows to the exterior, sliding windows to the verandah, and louvres (glass removed) within the interior. The OC and RSM offices are connected by a small, timber sliding service window. Interior metal security grills are attached to all windows in the store section. All doors are of timber; the entry doors are partially glazed and those to the office section are high waisted.
Elements that are not of cultural heritage significance include: lightweight partitions in the store section, linoleum floor linings, kitchenettes, plywood boarding over windows and doors, paint over external brickwork, and wire mesh and timber screens dividing the subfloor area.
Motor Transport (MT) Building ().
The Motor Transport Building is a brick and timber-framed structure with a concrete slab floor and a skillion roof clad in profiled-metal sheets. The building is rectangular in plan and is largely open for the provision for vehicle-parking in the centre, with brick enclosures at the northern and southern ends. A brick wall with protruding brick piers runs along the eastern side of the building and square timber posts, with timber bracing, hardwood post guards and metal feet, support the roof in the central section.
The northern enclosure includes an eastern and a western office, and the southern enclosure forms a dangerous goods store. The walls of the eastern office are of painted brickwork, while those in the western office are plaster. Timber skirtings and architraves within the western office are of a simple profile. Walls in the dangerous goods store are facebrick. The ceilings within all enclosures are lined with flat sheeting with rounded cover strips.
Early timber joinery retained in the building includes: timber-framed casements to the offices; a panelled timber door to the western office; timber-framed casements with wired glass and metal grates; and VJ-lined timber doors braced with metal strips to the dangerous goods store. External fixed timber louvre sunshades are attached to the eastern office's windows.
Non-significant elements include wire mesh and corrugated metal sheets that divide the central parking area, and plywood boarding over windows.
Former POW Exercise yard.
A roughly rectangular parade ground (former POW exercise yard) is located between the cell blocks, Q-Store and MT Cover. It is a flattened surface that slightly slopes down from the MT Cover to the west. As an open area, it provides a visual link between the five buildings of cultural heritage significance.
Landscape Features within heritage register boundary.
Early concrete retaining walls and concrete stairs survive in various locations within the cultural heritage boundary, including: to the east and south of the MT Cover, northeast and south of the Q-Store, between the western cell blocks, and between the southern cell block and MT Store.
Heritage listing.
Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The former Combined Services Detailed Interrogation Centre (Interrogation Centre) at Indooroopilly, which includes three brick and timber cell blocks () and a related Prisoner of War (POW) exercise yard, is important surviving evidence of the only purpose-built World War II (WWII) facility in Australia for interrogating enemy POWs. As the headquarters of the joint United States-Australian Allied Translator and Interpreter Section (ATIS) from 1942-1945, the Interrogation Centre played an important part in Queensland, Australian, and global history. Military intelligence obtained from the POWs interrogated at the Interrogation Centre played an important part in the Allied war effort against Japan and also in investigating war crimes committed by Japanese forces.
The former Interrogation Centre also includes a brick Q-Store and Office and a brick Motor Transport Cover (both ) which are important in demonstrating the use, from 1951, of the site as the headquarters of the Australian Army's Provost (military police) presence in Queensland. The 1950s expansion of the Provost Corps, and of the military police presence at the former Interrogation Centre, was due to the introduction of Australia's third National Service scheme (1951–59).
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
The three cell blocks are the last surviving buildings of the former Interrogation Centre, the only purpose-built WWII interrogation centre for POWs in Australia. They are also unique as the only cell blocks constructed in Australia during WWII for holding enemy POWs, mainly Japanese POWs, prior to interrogation by the ATIS.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
The former Interrogation Centre demonstrates the characteristics of a military detention site. The centre accommodated enemy POWs during WWII, and detained Australian soldiers from 1951.
The cell blocks comprise five cells off a passageway running the length of each block, with an adjacent guard room and bathroom section. The southern cell block and western (central) cell block both retain their cell doors and barred windows, plus a locking mechanism above the cell doors along the passageway.
The former POW exercise yard still exists as an open space between the buildings, and was used after WWII as a parade ground. The arrangement of buildings around the parade ground is a characteristic of Australian Army barracks.
The Q-Store and Office retains all its original storage and office spaces, as does the 12-bay Motor Transport Cover. Both these buildings demonstrate the facilities (office and storage space, and vehicle garaging) required by a Provost unit to carry out its duties.
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.
As the WWII headquarters of the ATIS, the former Interrogation Centre has a close association with an intelligence organisation that provided valuable information to the General Headquarters (GHQ) of US General Douglas MacArthur, during his direction of the war in the South-West Pacific Area (SWPA) theatre.

The Wasting

The Wasting is a 2017 Canadian-British drama film written and directed by Carolyn Saunders and starring Lauren McQueen, Gray O'Brien, and Alexz Johnson. It screened at film festivals in Europe and North America, winning Best Horror at the 2017 Austrian Independent Film Festival and Best Feature awards in two categories at the Vittorio Veneto film festival. The film's public premiere took place in Toronto on March 2, 2018, and it was released online in the United States and Canada in June 2018.
Plot.
A teenage woman faces emotional challenges – a budding romance with her new boyfriend and growing conflicts with her father's strictness. While trying to deal with these issues, she stops eating. While her health deteriorates because of her eating disorder, she sees the ghost of a frightening old woman every night. Her friends and family believe these sightings are hallucinatory or mere nightmares. With no one believing her, she must search for a solution.
Production.
Writer-director Saunders said that her inspiration came while writing for the documentary series Ghostly Encounters, when she met an anorexic young woman whom nobody believed was visited nightly by a ghost. The woman's story became the television episode, "Anorexia and the Haunting Hag," and, intrigued by the relationship between eating disorders and the supernatural, Saunders wrote "The Wasting" "with input from several people suffering anorexia."
Initially, the filmmakers attempted to fund the movie through the Canadian Film Centre's CFC Features program, which would have required filming in Canada. When Canadian Film Centre funding was unavailable, production was moved to Upton-upon-Severn in Worcestershire, U.K., to benefit from the UK Film Tax Relief program and the availability of experienced crew and actors.
During early development of the film, Saunders approached her friend Alexz Johnson to participate as actor, musician, and co-producer. Saunders described the movie as a "family affair," as her sons, Brendan Flynn and Sean Stevenson appear in the cast as brothers.
Release.
"The Wasting" premiered to excellent reviews at the 2017 Borrego Springs Film Festival in Borrego Springs, California. The film won the Best Horror award at the 2017 Austrian Independent Film Festival, and was an official selection at the Carmarthen Bay Film Festival, the Madeira Film Festival, and the Nevada Women's Film Festival. At the Vittorio Veneto film festival, "The Wasting" won the Monte Pizzoc and Monte Visentin awards, voted by more than 1000 young adults in the audience.
North American rights to distribute "The Wasting" were acquired by IndieCan Entertainment in 2017. In 2018, the North American premiere of the film was took place in Toronto. The online release of the film for Canada and the United States took place in June 2018.
Critical reception.
At its Borrego Springs Film Festival premiere, Steve Oldfield of FoxTV called The Wasting "a mind-bending visual feast" and said "director Carolyn Saunders' first feature shows she is a force to be reckoned with - a visual storyteller with a gift for creating suspense." After a sold out premiere screening in Toronto, The Extra Mile said "Saunders has woven many visual and sound elements to create a compelling film that shines a light on perception and reality," praising Lauren McQueen's "stellar performance" and the "poignant portrayals of Johnson, Flynn and Stevenson." Leora Heilbronn in Brief Take said "there’s a hauntingly ghoulish subplot in there that’s reminiscent of a Gaskell or Poe story, but the film also tackles the all too prevalent acceptance of toxic masculinity and anorexia in a refreshingly original way." Edmonton Movie Guide called it "a thoughtful, complex film" in which "the characters are well drawn and realistic, strongly portrayed by the young, highly watchable cast." Other reviews were mixed, and mostly positive.

Giovanni Battista Ramenghi

Giovanni Battista Ramenghi (1521, Bologna - 1601, Bologna) was an Italian painter. He is sometimes known as Bagnacavallo junior or Bagnacavallo the Younger to distinguish him from his father Bartolomeo Ramenghi (known as Bagnacavallo).
Life.
He trained in his father's studio and accompanied Primaticcio on his trip to France, where he was influenced for a time by the Fontainebleau School. Working to meet the strictures of the Counter-Reformation, Ramenghi was one of the most conservative painters of the Bolognese school of the time, moving on from Raphael but refusing to be influenced by the early work of the young Annibale Carracci

Svein Haugsgjerd

Svein Haugsgjerd (born August 3, 1942) is a Norwegian psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. He is notable for using psychodynamic psychotherapy to treat patients with schizophrenia.
He is influenced by the Kleinian tradition in psychoanalysis and by the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, on whom Haugsgjerd wrote a book-length introduction in 1986.
He has published extensively on the field of psychodynamic psychiatry in Norwegian. Several of his books, including textbooks, have been translated into other Nordic languages.
Career.
Haugsgjerd was employed at Gaustad Hospital, a large psychiatric hospital in Oslo, from 1973 to 2012. He was chief physician from 1988 to 1992.
In 1975 Haugsgjerd chose Donald Meltzer, a psychoanalyst who made important contributions to the Kleinian tradition in psychoanalysis, as his mentor.
In 1977 Haugsgjerd and colleagues established the experimental treatment unit "Kastanjebakken" at Gaustad Hospital, which drew on Kleinian and neo-Kleinian ideas about treatment. Haugsgjerd took a leading role from 1977 to 1982. The unit offered younger patients (age &lt; 40) diagnosed with schizophrenia, with a duration of illness ≥ 3 years, a combination of long-term individual psychotherapy and milieu therapy. A follow-up study of the 27 first participants concluded that one-third of the patients had good outcomes.
Besides treating patients, Haugsgjerd was responsible for supervision and teaching at Gaustad Hospital. From 2000 to 2010 he taught and supervised Stavropol Regional Psychoanalytical Association in Russia. In 2003 he was appointed as a professor II (adjunct professor) at the Centre for Practical Knowledge, Nord University, in Bodø.

Chongmingia

Chongmingia is a genus of primitive avialan belonging to Pygostylia that lived during the Aptian. It was found in the Jiufotang Formation in Chaoyang, China, and was described by Wang "et al"., 2016. The name comes from the word "Chongming", referring to a Chinese mythological bird, and the specific epithet is in honor of Mr. Xiaoting Zheng.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 2015; the description appeared in the pages of "Scientific Reports". Only the holotype, extracted from the Jehol Biota sediments from the Early Cretaceous period in north-east China, was discovered. "Chongmingia zhengi" represents a developmental line unknown at the time of description, it illustrates the diversity of traits in contemporary birds. The "furcula" in "C. zhengi" was stiff, which indicates their poor performance and the need to use more force on the fly. On the other hand, the relatively long forelimb and well-developed chest and shoulder keel on the humerus may indicate that the bird was able to provide enough strength to rise into the air. The presence of gastroliths indicates the prevalence of herbivory in early birds. Depending on the point of view, "C. zhengi" represents a previously unknown sister taxa to the Ornithothoraces clade, belonging to Avialae, or a sister taxon to a clade made up of all other Avialae except "Archaeopteryx".
The creators of the genus proposed two possible cladograms depicting kinship between "C. zhengi" and related taxa. The proposal that the new genus is a sister group for a clade made up of all the other avialans except "Archaeopteryx" is marked in green, while the competitive hypothesis for the Ornithothoraces sister group in its shown in blue.
In the 2018 description of the basal pygostylian "Jinguofortis", "Chongmingia" was recovered as a basal pygostylian sister to the former genus, and both genera placed in the new family Jinguofortisidae.

Rance (series)

Rance is a role-playing video-game series created, developed, and published by AliceSoft. It is the oldest continually-running erotic video-game series. The first installment, "Rance – Quest for Hikari –", was released in 1989, while the last main-series game, "Rance X – Showdown –", was released in 2018.
The "Rance" series follows the titular character, Rance, as he saves a number of kingdoms, defeats demon invaders, and causes mischief in the in-game world, "The Continent." He has appeared in most of the main series games as the playable character, accompanied by his loyal slave, Sill Plain. The main series has ten full games, with two "Rance IV" followups, while the "Kichikuou Rance" ("Brutal King Rance") is an alternative-universe spin-off. In addition, the first three games, "Rance – Quest for Hikari –", "Rance II – The Rebellious Maidens –"and "Rance III – Fall of Leazas –" have been retro-actively superseded by their later-released versions, "Rance 01 – Quest for Hikari –", "Rance 02 – The Rebellious Maidens –" and "Rance 03 – Fall of Leazas –".
Games.
"Rance – Quest for Hikari –".
Rance is given the task of finding and protecting the daughter of a rich family by Keith Gold, the owner of a local guild to which Rance is attached; he appears in almost all of the "Rance" series games. Rance investigates the city, while Sill investigates at the all-girls Paris Academy, where the kidnapping victim attended school. The first game made by AliceSoft, it was released on the PC-8800 and PC-9800 series of computers, as well as the Sharp X68000, the MSX 2 and 2+, the FM TOWNS, and the PC88VA. A Windows 95–03 version of the game was released in the late 1990s, about eight years after the first game was released.
"Rance 01 – Quest for Hikari –".
"Rance 01 – Quest for Hikari –", released for Windows in 2013, has the same setting as "Rance – Hikari Quest –", and replaces the latter in the main canon. The game featured an improved gameplay system, and features more new content from "Rance – Quest for Hikari –" comparatively to "Rance 02 – The Rebellious Maidens –", the re-release of "Rance II – The Rebellious Maidens –". The game was officially released in English by MangaGamer in 2020.
"Rance II – The Rebellious Maidens –".
The city of Kathtom, a member of the Free Cities Alliance, is suddenly entombed under-ground by the Four Mages who were tasked to guard the town by Ragishss Cryhausen, the city's former guardian. Rance sets out with Sill to defeat them, but soon learns that their minds were corrupted by the power of the rings that they wield. Rance sets out to prevent them from receiving the magic power the rings grant. It was released on the same computer systems as the first "Rance" game was.
"Rance 02 – The Rebellious Maidens –".
A graphical re-make of "Rance II – The Rebellious Maidens –", released for Windows in 2009. It was the genesis for the other early "Rance" series game re-releases. It did not contain as much new content as the next re-release, "Rance 01 – Quest for Hikari –". Later released Kai version includes the completely rewritten script to better fit the main canon. 
"Rance III – The Fall of Leazas –".
Leazas, a kingdom ruled by Queen Lia, who marries Rance in the "Brutal King Rance" time-line, is invaded by the warring empire of Helman, to the west. Demons are believed to be the cause of the attack, and to solve that problem, Rance sets out to find the "Chaos" sword, which contains the soul of an incredible thief from about one and one-half millennia ago. It was released on the PC-9800 series of computers, along with Sharp X68000 and the FM TOWNS; an early Windows release, similar to those that the first two "Rance" games received, was also released.
"Rance 03 – The Fall of Leazas –".
A complete re-creation of "Rance III – The Fall of Leazas –", released for Windows in 2015. The graphics are renewed, while the story is changed to better fit into the main canon. It is the most advanced of the early "Rance" re-releases.
"Rance IV – The Legacy of the Sect –".
This game directly follows the events of its predecessor. Rance, having defeated the demons of Helman and saved Leazas, is teleported to Ylapu, a giant floating island above Leazas. There, Rance must find a way to escape from the island, but is hindered by agents of Leazas and Helman who come to retrieve him to The Continent. The legacy alluded to by the game's title is a powerful magical artifact left by the Holy Magic Sect. It was released for the PC-9800 series and the FM TOWNS.
"Rance 4.1 ~ Save the Medicine Plant! ~".
Rance accepts a quest to stop a horde of under-ground monsters from attacking the Happiness Pharmaceutical building, where the Seirogan, a healing medicine, is produced. They discover that the perpetrators are the Angel Army; one of their commanders escapes, which begins the next game, "Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~".
"Rance 4.2 ~ Angel Army ~".
In a continuance of the previous game, "Rance 4.1 ~ Save the Medicine Plant! ~", Rance chases down the remainder of the Angel Army, while himself being chased after by an assassination group and three "Rare Gal-Monsters," a class of unique enemies that he offended in "Rance IV – The Legacy of the Sect –". The two games were released for the PC-9800 series, with a separate on-disc version.
"Brutal King Rance".
The game was assumed to be the final in the "Rance" series, and one of the final AliceSoft games; however, its great popularity allowed the company to continue its production of games. Rance, bored of his normal life, gathers a group of outlaw bandits and takes over some towns in southern Helman. The imperial army quickly puts down Rance's rebellion and take Sill captive; however, he escapes to Leazas, where he marries the country's queen to become a tyrant "brutal king," commanding his own army to seek his revenge on Helman. Large opposition forces arise tried to remove the tyrant ruler from power; yet, Rance continues his trials to re-assert his power as the King of Leazas, retrieve Sill from Helman control, and take over the world. Rance, in fulfilling his general "rôle" as an epic hero, saves The Continent from destruction by a greater evil. It is the first territory acquisition-based "Rance" game, and was the genesis for other similarly-designed games. It was also the first AliceSoft game released for Windows, instead of any number of Japanese computer systems. All other "Rance" games to-date have been released for Windows.
"Rance 5D – The Lonely Girl –".
The temporary stop in the production of "Rance" games, including the release of "Daiakuji" a year prior, led to the largest time-gap in-between the release of two "Rance" games. "Rance 5D – Lonely Girl –" is based on a unique roulette system, where the role-playing elements are determined by randomisation. In the game, Rance is travelling through The Continent, trying to recover the always-lacking money, when Rance and Sill accidentally enter Genbu Castle, a separate dimension. Rance et al. must then escape the dimension, with a newly-found woman, Rizna Lanfbitt of Zeth.
"Rance VI – Collapse of Zeth –".
Rance, continuing his trials from "Rance 5D – The Lonely Girl –", travels to Zeth, a kingdom to the south-west of Leazas. He offends Radon, a high governmental official, and is sent to the slave camp; Sill, who he bought from the Zeth slave camp, is treated very kindly. While within the Zeth slave camp, Rance joins the resistance group "Ice Flame," which seeks to change the un-equal governing system of Zeth, which is biased against non-magic users. "Rance VI – Collapse of Zeth –" is considered to be one of the best games in the "Rance" series, which is helped by the continuance of the game from the "Brutal King Rance" time-line.
"Warring-States Rance".
Rance sets out for JAPAN, an island archipelago to the east of The Continent, which is modeled after the Warring-States Period of Japanese history. The original English translation of this game, that of Yandere Translations, gave the "Rance" series, and AliceSoft in general, a noticeable presence in the western world. Warring-States "Rance", also known by its title in Japanese, "Sengoku Rance", and as Rance VII, was one of AliceSoft's best-selling titles of all time. In the game, Rance, having taken control of one of the feudal states, seeks to take over JAPAN through his control of the state, and save it from destruction.
"Rance Quest – Rance Quest –".
Also known as Rance VIII, a continuation of the previous game, "Warring-States Rance", wherein Rance returns to The Continent to seek a cure for the curse placed on Sill. While attempting to convince the Queen of Pencilcow, a kingdom to the west of Leazas, to cure Sill, he offends her, and she places a curse on him that he must become much stronger to overcome. He then journeys around The Continent, seeking a cure for himself and Sill. The game is based more upon the cessation of the stories of individual characters rather than a more continuous story-line.
"Rance Quest MAGNUM".
An expansion of "Rance Quest – Rance Quest –", this game follows Rance as he quests around The Continent to break the curse incurred upon himself in the previous game. The game focuses on the addition of sundry quests, through which Rance can adventure, ostensibly to cure his curse, although primarily in practice to assuage the effects of the curse.
"Rance IX – The Helmanian Revolution –".
The government of Helman has fallen into the hands of Stessel Ignon, who corrupts the country and plans to take over the entirety of The Continent. A revolutionary force gathers, seeking to replace the former emperor to the throne, and they solicit the aid of Rance, who agrees, hoping to remove Sill's curse. The Prime Minister, Stessel, has been planning this, and his actions have been seen earlier in the "Rance" series; he pushed for the war between Helman and Leazas in the events of "Rance III – The Fall of Leazas –".
"Rance X – Showdown –".
The last game in the "Rance" series, it was released on 23 February 2018. The war amongst the demon lords of the Monster Realm has ended, and they now invade the human realm, to their east. Rance leads the combined forces of all humanity to battle the attacking demons. It is known to have the biggest video game script ever created.
Characters.
The "Rance" series has featured a large number of characters throughout its installments. A number of characters are shown below.
The main playable and the titular character of the "Rance" series. He is a powerful warrior who was created to the "kichiku" character archetype. He was based out of a town in the Free Cities Alliance, where he accepts jobs from Keith's Guild when he is low on money. He lives in the "Rance Castle," which he had built after the events of "Rance Quest – Rance Quest –". The games generally feature quests and other missions that he embarks upon to gain or regain the money he has lost.
A powerful magic user that generally accompanies Rance on his quests. He bought her from a slave camp in Zeth, where she was born; she now must travel with him wherever he goes. She was frozen in ice at the end of "Warring-States Rance" and freed at the end of "Rance IX – The Helmanian Revolution –".
An organic-base android that functions as a pet to Rance. An accident during her creation caused her to have lower intelligence and an inability to gain a higher level. She was created in the events of "Rance IV – The Legacy of the Sect –". She is a noted magic user, although she is not as powerful as Sill due to her limitations.
The Queen of Leazas, who married Rance in "Brutal King Rance". She brought a new age of prosperity to the kingdom, which led to an antagonism en-brewed amongst a number of foreign countries and noblemen. She became the queen after her two brothers were killed in a succession dispute. She grants her hand-maiden, Maris Amaryllis, a large amount of governing power, whilst regularly taking maidens by way of her JAPANese ninja, Kentou Kanami. Her taking was eventually stopped by Rance.
A JAPANese ninja acquired by Queen Lia Leazas after she got lost on The Continent. She is generally engaged in assisting the queen in getting the affection of Rance, although she was used to gather maidens until the events of "Rance – Quest for Hikari –".
A magic user, originally from Zeth; she is first encountered by Rance in the Genbu Castle dimension in "Rance 5D – The Lonely Girl –" when he accidentally enters there. She is incredibly naïve, and that naïveté caused her a lot of pain while trapped in the alternate dimension; while a kind spirit helped her, it was Rance that enabled her to escape. She is now in the protection of the King of Zeth, a childhood friend of hers whom she knew before she was imprisoned.
A noted business-women, who seeks to marry Rance to increase her luck. She was born as a miko, but after predicting her own future as one of great misfortune, became obsessed with luck and wealth; this caused her to strive towards business, where she succeeded. She is first encountered in "Rance 5D – The Lonely Girl –", while seeking a man who has great luck.
The leader of the Zeth resistance group Ice Flame. She is introduced to Rance when he enters the Zeth slave camp in "Rance VI – Collapse of Zeth –", and takes control of her resistance group. The game continues, Zeth is made more equal, and the resistance groups is disbanded. She becomes one of the Four Lords who guard Zeth, the first non-magic user to do so.
The Muralaloux of the AL Church, the dominant religion on The Continent. She first appeared in "Rance Quest – Rance Quest –" as a bishop in the church; she became the Muralaloux when the former one, Duran Teyuran, died. She has a great knowledge of curses, and helped free Sill from her curse at the ending of "Rance IX – The Helmanian Revolution –".
She was saved by Rance whilst being attacked by monsters during the events of "Rance Quest – Rance Quest –" and turned into a slave. She is a member of the AL Church, and is very respectful to Crook, the church's Muralaloux. She is a very powerful guard in combat.
A former prince of Helman, who led the war against Leazas in the events of "Rance III – The Fall of Leazas –". He has a major "rôle" in "Rance IX – The Helmanian Revolution –", where Rance aids him in a large force seeking to take back the country from its current, corrupt state.
OVA.
A hentai OVA based upon the series, "Rance: Sabaku no Guardian", was released on December 25, 1993. It was not directly related to the events of any game in the series. It consisted of two episodes.
A second original video animation series, "Rance 01: Hikari wo Motomete The Animation", was an adaptation of the re-release of the first game, "Rance 01 – Quest for Hikari –", and was released from December 26, 2014 to June 24, 2016. Consisting of four episodes, the OVA was directed by Takashi Nishikawa and animated by studio Seven.

Sant'Isaia

Sant'Isaia is a Roman Catholic church located at the intersection of via Sant'Isaia and via De' Marchi in Bologna, region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy. The church is dedicated to the prophet Isaiah.
History.
Legend states that it originated in the 1st century, but the first documentary record of it dates to 1088, at which time it was outside the city walls. It became the centre of its district and by 1223 was a gathering-place for musters of soldiers. For a time at the end of the 14th century it housed Dominican nuns after the destruction of their monastery outside the walls - they later built and moved to the nearby San Mattia complex. The church was rebuilt between 1624 and 1633 to designs by Pietro Fiorini, including a side portico and a new internal layout. His son Sebastiano took over the works in 1629 on his father's death.
Luigi Marchesini (1796-1882) radically altered the church, adding two side aisles to the nave, a cupola and a large chapel as well as rebuilding the facade in Neoclassical fashion as a side portico. It reopened for worship on 5 July 1837.

Derrynacreeve

Derrynacreeve () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Derrynacreeve is bounded on the north by Drumcanon (Kinawley) and Drumcar (Kinawley) townlands, on the south by Tawnagh townland, on the west by Derryvahan townland and on the east by Gortullaghan and Dunglave townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), a stream, forestry plantations and dug wells. Derrynacreeve is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland), the R200 road (Ireland), the N87 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 122 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Derrynacreeve was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is "Baile Cluain Loch", meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow') 
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of "Dirrenekrett to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name". William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688).
The Sheridan lands in Derrynacreeve were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows:
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as "Dirrenacrew" and the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford".
The 1655 Down Survey map of Tullyhaw depicts the townland as "Derrinecrew".
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there was one Hearth Tax payer in - "Dirinecre- Edmond McGawran".
A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 38 acres-1 rood-24 perches of unprofitable land in "Derrenetrew or Derrenetrue". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of "Derrenetrew" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Derrynacreeve".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list five tithepayers in the townland. 
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- "The soil inclines to clay...a river likewise bounds it on the north."
The Derrynacreeve Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 60, being 29 males and 31 females. There were eleven houses in the townland, of which two were uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 45, being 19 males and 26 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were nine houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists nine landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 54, being 23 males and 31 females. There were eight houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twelve families listed in the townland, and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are thirteen families listed in the townland.
Folklore relating to Derrynacreeve is found in the 1938 Dúchas collection.

National Government Administrative Center

The National Government Administrative Center (NGAC) is a mixed-used development situated in New Clark City, Capas, Tarlac. It will primarily host facilities for the Philippine government such as offices of various government agencies, government housing units, sport facilities and other support services facilities. The area is owned and managed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority.
History.
Development and construction.
The area is part of New Clark City and is owned and managed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority. The NGAC is being developed by AlloyMTD, the investment arm of Malaysian firm MTD Capital.
The planning for the NGAC began as early as September 2017 with the groundbreaking ceremony held on January 23, 2018. Actual construction work began on March 15, 2018. The Phase 1 of the development includes backup offices of various government agencies as contingency in case a national calamity and disaster affect the capital, Manila as well as a "one-stop-shop" for business enterprises in Central Luzon.
Phase 1A of the development includes the construction of a sports complex consisting of a stadium with 20,100 seating capacity and an aquatics center with 2,000 seating capacity which is meant to be one of the venues of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games to be hosted by the Philippines. It also includes two buildings which will host the Integrated Operations Center which includes a satellite office of the Office of the President of the Philippines and disaster and risk management agencies, a 500-unit condominium housing for government employees, and a river park. Phase 1B involves the construction of additional government facilities.
The Bases Conversion and Development Authority and the Supreme Court of the Philippines signed a memorandum of agreement in July 2019 regarding the construction of a building complex to host a regional office for the high court.
The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas will relocate its security plant complex from East Avenue, Quezon City to New Clark City after it signed a memorandum of agreement with the BCDA in September 2019. The new currency production facility will be located at the 29-hectare land near the access road connecting New Clark City to the Subic–Clark–Tarlac Expressway and it is expected to be completed within two years.

San Mattia, Bologna

San Mattia was a former Roman Catholic monastery and church located at 14 via Sant'Isaia in Bologna, region of Emilia Romagna, Italy. The church was dedicated to Saint Matthias.
History.
An earlier church was built just outside the Porta Saragozza for nuns from the San Mattia convent, a group of nuns originally derived from the Santa Maria del Monte della Guardia, who were guardians of the Basilica of San Luca. They resided in that convent until it was destroyed in 1537 in the wars between Bologna and the Visconti. Some time later they built a new convent on the via Sant'Isaia, re-using houses and other properties they had acquired there. The new convent's church was built between 1575 and 1588 by Pietro Fiorini to plans by Antonio Morandi, known as "Il Terribilia". It housed the image of the Virgin from San Luca for two days each year during its annual procession. It was rebuilt in the 18th century, with lavish additions to the decoration but only minor alterations to the underlying architecture. The convent was suppressed in 1799 after the French invasion and ceded to a private owner. The city council converted the convent buildings into a school in the 1830s, which it still is today, whilst the church was deconsecrated and used as a warehouse until the end of the 1970s, when it and part of the monastery buildings were sold by the city council to the Sovrintendenza per i beni architettonici dell'Emilia Romagna. This body restored it from 1981 onwards and used it to host cultural events. Since 2015 it has housed the Polo museale dell'Emilia Romagna.

De Nuremberg à Nuremberg

De Nuremberg à Nuremberg (fr: "From Nuremberg to Nuremberg") is a French documentary film about the Third Reich by Frédéric Rossif, with text written and read by Philippe Meyer, produced by Jean Frydman.
The title is a reference to both the Nazi mass Nuremberg Rallies held in Nuremberg from 1933, at the beginning of the regime, and to the Nuremberg Trials (1945-1946), after its fall.
Synopsis.
Two versions of the film, a short and a long one, respectively cut into two or four parts.
The 180-minute version is divided into two parts:
The 238-minute version is divided into four parts:
Editing and release.
Philippe Meyer and Frédéric Rossif has decided that the text should in no way express moral outrage or indignation, or any preconceived idea, as pure facts should in their view be sufficient to gather the viewer's attention and reflection. To keep the film as neutral as possible, the text was eventually read by Meyer himself, as to make certain that no affect would taint it.
Meyer stated that some of the cited facts, such as the German-Soviet non-aggression pact and some of its implications (notably petrol for the German planes involved in the bombings of London originating in the Soviet Union) were not well-known to the public in 1986, and that the documentary allowed some viewers to learn some details of the war. The film was delivered to Antenne 2 in 1987, but was not released for two years: firstly, it was not aired until after the French presidential election of 1988, as to avoid any semblance of opposition to its far-right candidate; furthermore, arguments such as « the French being divided » on the subject, or the notion that « Nazism does not interest anyone anymore », were put forwards and retarded the release.

Claudius de Goeje

Claudius Henricus de Goeje (4 May 1879 – 8 June 1955) was a Dutch Navy officer and cartographer, who took a special interest in the Wayana and Tiriyó peoples he encountered on his expeditions to the interior of Suriname. For his lifelong interest in the Amerindian peoples of the Surinamese interior, he was awarded an endowed professorship in the Linguistics and Anthropology of Suriname and Curaçao at Leiden University in 1946. De Goeje retired in 1951 and died four years later, in 1955.
The De Goeje Mountains in Suriname are named after Claudius de Goeje.
Biography.
Claudius de Goeje was born in Leiden to Dutch orientalist Michael Jan de Goeje and Wilhelmina Henriëtte Leembruggen. Claudius de Goeje did not excel in school and chose to pursue a career in the Royal Netherlands Navy, where he could fulfil his dream of travelling the world. Until 1909, he worked as a lieutenant at the "Dienst der Hydrografie" in the Dutch East Indies. Between 1910 and 1924, De Goeje worked at the Maritime Transport Service in Batavia. Because of his talents in cartography, De Goeje was allowed leave several times to be part of expeditions to the Surinamese interior under the auspices of the Royal Netherlands Geographical Society.
De Goeje was a cartographer during the Gonini expedition of 1903–1904 and the Tapanahony expedition of 1904, which were led by Alphons Franssen Herderschee. De Goeje subsequently led the Tumuk Humak expedition of 1907. Thirty years later, after his retirement from the navy, De Goeje once more visited Suriname as part of the expedition of 1936 and 1937 to establish the Surinamese border with Brazil led by Conrad Carel Käyser.

Haplogroup R-DF27

In human genetics, Haplogroup R-DF27 (R1b1a2a1a2a) is a Y-chromosome haplogroup which is a subdivision of haplogroup R-M269 (more specifically, its subclade R-) defined by the presence of the marker DF27 (also known as S250). Along with R-U152 and R-L21, the lineage is to a significant extent associated with Proto-Celtic, Celtic and later Celtiberian movements.
It arose comparatively recently, after the beginning of the European Bronze Age, and is mostly prevalent in the population of the Pyrenees region. The regions where it has been mostly found are Basque Country, Navarre, Asturias, Galicia, Portugal, Aragon, Catalonia, Pyrénées-Atlantiques as well as a some presence in Great Britain and Ireland, though it has been found in smaller quantities as far away as Germany and Poland.
Specific subclades of DF27 have been associated with specific groups of people, for example R-M167 is associated with the Catalans and R-M153 is associated with the Basques. 
Genetic testing.
The technology to test for DF27 was developed by Thomas Krahn, then of Family Tree DNA. This marker was discovered to exist among people who had taken part in the Human Genome Diversity Project. Richard A. Rocca made a pioneering study of DF27, which was published in 2012 in the article "Discovery of Western European R1b1a2 Y Chromosome Variants in 1000 Genomes Project Data", in the peer-reviewed journal PLOS Biology. He based his study on 208 people who had tested as R-M269 and were from Great Britain, Tuscany (Italy), Spain, Finland, Utah (United States) and Latin American (Colombia, Puerto Rico, etc). 
Distribution.
According to a 2017 article published in "Springer Nature" entitled, "Analysis of the R1b-DF27 haplogroup shows that a large fraction of Iberian Y-chromosome lineages originated recently in situ", DF27 was found in frequences of 40% in the general population of the Iberian Peninsula and in particular spikes at 70% among the Basques. Overall in France it accounts for between 6–20% of the population but has a high level in the Pyrenees area. It is estimated to have developed around 4,200 years ago in north-eastern Prehistoric Iberia as the Neolithic made way for the Atlantic Bronze Age. The DF27 subgroups correspond closely to the various pre-Roman kingdoms formed by the Celtiberians.

3 Hong Kong

3 Hong Kong (also known as 3HK or Three HK; ) is a telecommunications and internet service provider operating in Hong Kong by Hutchison Telecommunications Hong Kong Holdings, a subsidiary of CK Hutchison, operating under the global Three brand. 3 Hong Kong is the first "Three-"branded company, leading to the development of other operations in different locations.
The company was founded in 1984 but was officially named as "3 Hong Kong" in 2002. It currently provides 4.5G, 4G LTE, 3G, GSM dual-band mobile telecommunications and Wi-Fi services through its own network infrastructure. 3HK also provides gaming and home entertainment services.
History.
The company started in 1984 as Hutchison Telecom Hong Kong, a telecommunications company that is granted licence to operate Advanced Mobile Phone Service (AMPS) cellular radio telephone network in Hong Kong. Afterwards, 3 launched Hong Kong's first analogue mobile telecommunications services in 1985.
In 1995, 3 launched their GSM service. In 1998, 3 pushed their first dual-band network in Hong Kong, which is Asia's first dual-band network.
In May 2004, its affiliated 2G operator Orange re-branded its services and changed its name to "3 Dualband", referring to the GSM product, and "3 CDMA", referring to the CDMA product.
On 29 May 2008, Hutchison Telecommunications (Hong Kong) Limited announced that it has signed an agreement with Apple Inc. to bring the iPhone to Hong Kong and Macau later that year under 3.
In 2010, 3 launched their 3Home Broadband (formerly 3ree Broadband) brand, integrating their fixed-line, mobile and Wi-Fi services together.
In 2012, 3 introduced 4G LTE service to Hong Kong. Later on, they announced full coverage in the MTR, the transit railway system in Hong Kong. In the same year, a partnership with Vodafone was launched. 3HK also became a member of the Conexus Mobile Alliance.
In 2014, they announced their plans to offer Skype's Unlimited World and also VoLTE services.
In 2016, 3 launched their 4.5G services.
In 2017, 3 Hong Kong partnered with Razer, launching a new concept store – RazerStore in Causeway Bay.
Services.
Mobile network.
Up till June 2017, 3 Hong Kong has 3.078 million subscribers, making them the third largest mobile network operator in Hong Kong. As to February 2018, 3 Hong Kong provided the following network service:
In 2017, it is reported that 3 is working with Huawei to provide 5G services in Hong Kong.
Home broadband.

The service has since become one of the key services of HGC Global Communications, another subsidiary of CK Hutchison. Despite the rebrand, 3 Hong Kong stores (dubbed as 3Shop) still provide customer services and promotions for HGC home broadband services.

Alexander Brodie, Lord Brodie

Alexander Brodie (1617–1680), of Brodie, lord of session, was descended from an old family, which in 1311 received the lands of Brodie in Elginshire from Alexander III.
Early life.
Brodie, born on 25 July 1617, was the eldest son of David Brodie of Brodie and Grizzel, daughter of Thomas Dunbar, and niece on her mother's side of the Admirable Crichton. In 1628 he was sent to England, where he remained till 1632. In the latter year he enrolled as a student in King's College, Aberdeen, but he didn't take a degree. On 19 May 1636 he was served heir of his father by a dispensation of the lords of council, and on 28 Oct. of the same year he married the widow of John Urquhart of Craigston, by whom he had a son and daughter.
Iconoclast.
Brodie was a strong Presbyterian, and, in December 1640, headed a party which demolished two oil paintings of the Crucifixion and the Day of Judgment in the cathedral of Elgin and also mutilated the finely carved interior of the building as unsuitable for a place of worship. This extreme puritanical zeal exposed him to the revenge of Montrose, who, in February 1645, burned and devastated his property, and carried off the family papers of the house of Brodie.
Shire commissioner.
In 1643 he was chosen as Shire Commissioner for the county of Elgin in parliament, and frequently served on parliamentary committees. He was also elected a representative to the general assembly of the church of Scotland. On 6 March 1649 he was appointed a commissioner to meet Charles II at the Hague.
Lord of Session.
After Brodie's return from the Hague he was nominated a lord of session on 22 June. He took the oaths in the presence of parliament on 23 July, and took his seat on the bench on 1 Nov. In February 1650 he was sent as commissioner of the general assembly to Breda, to induce the king to sign the national covenant. He was also a member of the various committees of estates during the attempt of Charles to wrest from Cromwell his dominion. In June 1653 he was cited by Cromwell to London to arrange for a union between the two kingdoms, but did not obey the summons, and 'resolved', as he expressed it, 'in the strength of the Lord to eschew and avoid employment under Cromwell.' He retired to his estate until Cromwell's death, when, on 3 Dec. 1658, he again took his seat on the bench. At the Restoration he was superseded and was also subjected to a fine of £4,000, Scots. In 1661 he paid a lengthy visit to London. He died on 17 April 1680.
Diary.
The Diary of Alex. Brodie, from 25 April 1652 to 1 Feb. 1654, was published in Edinburgh in 1740 by an unknown editor. The complete Diary, from 1650 to 17 April 1680, with a continuation by his son, James Brodie (1637-1708), to February 1685, was published by the Spalding Club in 1863, with an introduction by David Laing. The part published in 1740 is chiefly concerned with his religious experiences, and is not an adequate sample of the Diary as a whole, which conveys much important information regarding political events, and a specially interesting account of his visit to London, and of the persons with whom he there came into contact. See also Shaw's History of the Province of Moray; Genealogy of the Brodie family, by William Brodie (1862).

St. Matthias, Berlin

St. Matthias is a Roman Catholic church in Berlin, serving a parish just in front of the Potsdam Gate.
The parish's first church was built in 1867-1868 using a 20,000 thaler donation from Prussian civil servant Matthias Aulike (his stipulation that it be served by a priest from his home diocese of Munster is still met today), making it the third oldest Roman Catholic parish in the city after those of St Hedwig and St. Sebastian. It rose from an initial 800 parishioners to 10,000 by around 1890 and an expansion to the first church proved inadequate.
A competition was therefore held to design a new church, with entries from August Menken among others. It was won by Engelbert Seibertz, with its foundation stone laid on 23 October 1893 by the parish priest and the consecration on 24 October 1895 led by Georg von Kopp, cardinal and bishop of Breslau. That new church was a hall church and still stands today on Winterfeldtplatz in the Schöneberg district.

Antigraviator

Antigraviator is an anti-gravity racing video game developed by Cybernetic Walrus and published by Iceberg Interactive in 2018 for Windows PC.
Premise.
"Antigraviator"'s setting is described as a near future where racing has gotten very popular due to scientific breakthroughs in anti-gravity and terraforming. As a result of these breakthroughs, the antigraviator tournament was born. The anti-gravity ships used in this tournament are called 'Gravs'.
Gameplay.
"Antigraviator" is an anti-gravity racing game in the vein of Wipeout and F-Zero, to which the game has been compared. The game has a single-player mode and a multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players. The game features no speed limit, as a result the game says to be the fastest game ever made.
Development.
"Antigraviator" was expected to release in Q2 2018 for Windows PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game developer is Belgian indie studio Cybernetic Walrus. Cybernetic Walrus is composed of alumni of Howest University in Belgium. The game is made using the Unity engine. The game was announced to receive a Kickstarter campaign in April 2017. Subsequently, the game failed to receive funding.
After the Kickstarter campaign, Dutch publisher Iceberg Interactive signed the game for a Q2 2018 multi-platform release. The game is set to be localized in English, French, German, Italian, Russian, and Simplified Chinese.
"Antigraviator" was developed using the Unity engine, which Unity Technologies has taken notice of. The game was selected for exhibiting at the Unite Austin 2017 Made with Unity showcase, where “unique games of varying styles, genres, mechanics, and platforms” where chosen to exhibit. Cybernetic Walrus' CEO Mike Coeck and Environment Artist Szabolcs Csizmadia was invited as a speaker to Unite Austin 2017. They gave a lecture on how the Cybernetic Walrus team used Unity 2017 to develop "Antigraviator". In addition, assets from the game were used in the Unite Austin training day, where attendees learned to create an anti-gravity racing game of their own using "Antigraviator's" assets. The training series was later released through YouTube.
Reception.
According to CBS Interactive's review aggregator Metacritic, the game received "mixed or average reviews", average rating is 65/100.

He was the eldest son of Johann Suibert Seibertz (1788–1871). He was only moderately successful in school and at age 17 he went to the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, where he was taught by Carl Friedrich Lessing, Wilhelm von Schadow, Peter von Cornelius and Theodor Hildebrandt. His first surviving independent work was a drawing of the Bruchhauser Steine.
He then moved to the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich in 1832. There he met Louis I of Bavaria's court painter Wilhelm von Kaulbach. Whilst in Munich he produced 74 artworks, including two monumental frescoes in the Maximilianeum. He moved back to his birthplace in 1835, making sketches and illustrations for "Faust" before moving to Prague for seven years in 1841 then Munich for twenty years in 1850. He created a total of 300 works for Maximilian II of Bavaria and designed glass windows for Glasgow Cathedral (removed during World War Two and not yet reinstated). He finally moved to Arnsberg in 1870, producing 140 more paintings before his death, mainly of well-known families from Sauerland.

National Cycle Network (NCN) Route 70 is a Sustrans National Route that runs from Walney Island in Cumbria to Sunderland. The route is fully open and signed. From end to end the route is , but two sections are shared with other NCN routes leaving Route 70 at .
History.
Route 70 is the original route of the W2W challenge route which was launched on 1 June 2005. When launched the route used sections of NCN Routes 72, 68 and 71 west of the Pennines. From Tan Hill to Sunderland a new Regional Route was created and given the number 20, with a blue background. In 2012, after improvements to meet National Cycle Network standards, it was upgrade to Route 70. Route signs were changed to the number 70 with a red background. Around the same time the sections on the route that had previously been Route 71 and 72 were re-signed as Route 70.
Route.
Walney to Oxenholme.
The eastern section is . From Walney Island in the Irish Sea it goes on to the industrial port of Barrow-in-Furness. It then runs through the Furness peninsula, passing the towns of Ulverston and the picturesque Grange-Over-Sands where the route follows the Promenade. The route continues to skirt the Lake District national park to Oxenholme, with a short branch from there to the historical market town of Kendal
Oxenholme to Barnard Castle.
The central sestion is . On reaching the Lune Valley the route joins the Pennine Cycleway (Route 68) and is signed accordingly from there for the miles to Asby. After this, the path continues as Route 70 moving in an easterly direction towards Kirkby Stephen and through the Pennines to Barnard Castle in County Durham. The highest point on the route is at Tan Hill, .
Barnard Castle to Sunderland.
The eastern section is . Continuing through Hamsterley, to reach the beautiful cathedral city of Durham. Regional Route 715 between Barnard Castle and Willington is an alternative W2W route, it is shorter and an easier ride via Bishop Auckland.

Derryvahan

Derryvahan () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Derryvahan is bounded on the north by Drumcar (Kinawley) townland, on the south by Garvary (Corlough) and Scrabby, Corlough townlands, on the west by Curraghabweehan and Drumbeagh townlands and on the east by Tawnagh and Derrynacreeve townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), a stream and dug wells. Derryvahan is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland), the R200 road and rural lanes. The townland covers 105 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Derryvahan was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is "Baile Cluain Loch", meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow') 
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. 
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Derryvaghan or Derrynoghan".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list eight tithepayers in the townland.
The Derryvahan Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 44, being 20 males and 24 females. There were nine houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 48, being 23 males and 25 females. There were eight houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists nine landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 47, being 24 males and 23 females. There were ten houses in the townland and all were inhabited apart from one in the course of erection.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twelve families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are eight families listed in the townland.
A description of Derryvahan in the 1930s by Brigid Josephine Mc Govern is available at 
Antiquities.
There are no known antiquities in the townland

Yulij Ilyashenko

Yulij Sergeevich Ilyashenko (Юлий Сергеевич Ильяшенко, 4 November 1943, Moscow) is a Russian mathematician, specializing in dynamical systems, differential equations, and complex foliations.
Ilyashenko received in 1969 from Moscow State University his Russian candidate degree (Ph.D.) under Evgenii Landis. Ilyashenko was a professor at Moscow State University, an academic at Steklov Institute, and also taught at the Independent University of Moscow. He became a professor at Cornell University.
His research deals with, among other things, what he calls the "infinitesimal Hilbert's sixteenth problem", which asks what one can say about the number and location of the boundary cycles of planar polynomial vector fields. The problem is not yet completely solved. Ilyashenko attacked the problem using new techniques of complex analysis (such as functional cochains). He proved that planar polynomial vector fields have only finitely many limit cycles. Jean Écalle independently proved the same result, and an earlier attempted proof by Henri Dulac (in 1923) was shown to be defective by Ilyashenko in the 1970s.
He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1978 at Helsinki and in 1990 with talk "Finiteness theorems for limit cycles" at Kyoto. In 2017 he was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.

On 18 February 2018, a 22-year-old man local to the Russia’s southern republic of Dagestan carrying a knife and a double-barreled shotgun opened fire on a crowd at an Orthodox church in Kizlyar, killing five women and injuring several other people, including two police and three others. He was shot and killed by police on duty nearby.
The attack occurred as churchgoers celebrated the Sunday of Forgiveness, the last day of Cheesefare week, a Christian holiday marking the last day before Lent according to the eastern Orthodox calendar.
The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) named the man Khalil al-Dagestani, one of its soldiers. Police named him Khalil Khalilov. Pro-ISIL social media later shared a video of a masked man with a shotgun and knife, said to be the killer, pledging his allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Indian Super Cup (1997–2011)

The Indian Super Cup was Indian football's annual match contested between the champions of the previous National Football League or I-League season and the holders of the Federation Cup, usually held at a neutral venue. If the League champions also won the Federation Cup then the league runners-up would provide the opposition. The fixture was usually considered the curtain raiser to the Indian football domestic season.
The fixture was last contested in 2011 when East Bengal won the cup for the third time, defeating Salgaocar 9–8 on penalties.
History.
The Indian Super Cup was started in 1997 by the All India Football Federation as a playoff between the then National Football League champions and Federation Cup holders. The first edition took place that year between the 1996–97 NFL (first season in league history) champions JCT Mills and 1996 Federation Cup holders East Bengal. After the match ended 0–0, East Bengal won the first Super Cup on penalties 4–2. Salgaocar proceeded to win the next two editions of the Super Cup before the tournament was suspended for three seasons. When the cup returned in 2003 Mahindra United defeated East Bengal on penalties 4–3 after drawing them 1–1. The cup was then held seven more times before being suspended and hasn't been played since the 2011 fixture.

Rania gens

The gens Rania was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens occur in history, but others are known from inscriptions. Lucius Ranius Optatus was consul in the early third century AD.
Origin.
The nomen "Ranius" resembles other gentilicia formed using the suffix "-anius", typically derived from place names and cognomina ending in "-anus". No corresponding location or surname is known, but the root of the nomen resembles "rana", a frog, and as a cognomen could have belonged to a common class of surnames derived from the names of familiar animals and objects.
The Ranii may have been of Sabine extraction, as one of the Ranii bore the surname "Sabinus", typically indicating Sabine ancestry, while another family of the name lived at Alba Fucens, in Sabinum. Chase lists "Ronius" among various gentilicia of Oscan derivation, but this may be a typo for "Ranius", as only a single "Ronius" is known from inscriptions.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Ranii were "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Quintus", three of the most common names throughout Roman history. Examples of "Aulus" and "Titus" are also known.
Branches and cognomina.
The Ranii used a number of surnames, including "Felix", fortunate or happy, "Fronto", originally applied to someone with a prominent forehead, "Pullo", blackish, "Sabinus", a Sabine, and "Optatus", desired or welcome, the only surname known to have been passed down through a distinct family of the Ranii.

The 1982–83 Idaho Vandals men's basketball team represented the University of Idaho during the 1982–83 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The two-time defending champions of the Big Sky Conference, Vandals were led by fifth-year head coach Don Monson and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho.
With expanded student seating, the Vandals set basketball attendance records at the Kibbie Dome with 11,000 against Washington State on and eight hundred more on February 12 against Montana for a conference The former was an overtime victory, the third straight over the Cougars in the Battle of the Palouse, on the same night that the resurgent Vandal football team narrowly lost a I-AA playoff game on the road, televised on cable by WTBS of The latter with Montana was a deflating nineteen-point defeat to snap the 43-game home winning streak, begun over three years earlier Idaho won its final three home games, but attendance fell; the highest was 8,000 for the finale against Boise State, Monson's hundredth and final win at Consecutive road losses the week prior at Idaho State and Weber State had eliminated any chance of another regular season title and the opportunity to host the conference

Potitus

Potitus (died around 160) was an early Christian martyr, venerated as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church on 14 January (or 13 January in the pre-2003 Roman Martyrology).
Life.
He was born in Sardica (now Sofia, capital of Bulgaria) in the Roman province of Thracia (established in 107 after the Second Dacian War and later renamed Dacia Inferior). He converted to Christianity and was martyred while still a teenager during the reign of Antoninus Pius. His hagiography states that he came from a very rich pagan family and attributes many miracles to him, especially the curing of the madness of Antoninus Pius' daughter Agnes, which is described in a 9th-century "Passio Sancti Potiti". He refused to renounce Christianity and so was thrown to the lions, but they refused to attack and so he was instead thrown into boiling oil, but emerged unharmed. He was therefore pierced with a sword.
Veneration.
He is the main patron saint of Tricarico and its diocese and his main relics are sited in its cathedral. His cult spread widely during the Middle Ages, reaching Capua, Naples and Benevento. He is thus also the main patron saint of the town of Ascoli Satriano and its diocese. Ascoli Satriano has a church dedicated to him as well as a bust-reliquary containing part of his ulna in its former cathedral - this reliquary is carried round the town in procession between 18 and 20 August each year and at the end of the festival the "ciuccio" is burned. Naples also once had a church dedicated to him, San Potito, served by Benedictines, whom pope Clement XII granted a special office in the saint's honour, with hymns edited by the Bollandists.

Legrand Legacy

Legrand Legacy: Tale of the Fatebounds is a role-playing video game developed by Semisoft and published by Another Indie. Semisoft describes the game as a "nostalgic love letter to classic JRPGs". The game was released in January 2018 on Microsoft Windows, and was released in 2019 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
Gameplay.
The game has been described by the game's developers as "nostalgic love letter to class JRPGs. The game features turn-based battles. The game's battle's contain quick time events, involving buttons quicktly being pressed as directed - similar to that found in "Final Fantasy VIII" and "The Legend of Dragoon", and a "weapons triangle" similar to that found in "Fire Emblem", where there are three main weapon types, each type being stronger and weaker to one other type. Outside of battle, similar to "Skies of Arcadia", the player may also recruit non-playable characters to reside and work in an old castle, which in turn offer new features and benefits to the player.
Story.
The story follows the protagonist Finn, a reluctant leader of a group of travelers. Finn has amnesia and special powers he doesn't understand, and is travelling through a world going through a civil war between Fandor and Altea.
Development and release.
"Legrand Legacy" was created and developed by Semisoft, a small video game company containing 27 in-house developers. Development of the game started in 2015, and development ran for 2 years with independent funding before turning to Kickstarter for additional funding. Two campaigns were done; an initial one, in November 2016, which was unsuccessful, and a second one, in January 2017, which met its funding goals. The successful campaign raised an additional £40,000 (approximately $54,000) for the latter part of development. The game's premise was to create a "love letter to classic JRPGs". The game was designed to feature 3D models that move over hand-drawn 2D backgrounds, a look shared by many PlayStation 1 and PlayStation 2 JRPGs. Influences for the game include "Suikoden", "The Legend of Dragoon", and "Final Fantasy".
A "prologue demo" of the game was released in November 2016. An early build of the game was featured at SXSW, PAX East, and E3 2017. The game's final release was initially scheduled for September 2017, but was later delayed; the game released on Microsoft Windows on January 24, 2018, via Steam and GOG.com. Around the time of its original release, it was also announced that the game would later be released on other platforms as well; Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2019.
Reception.
"Legrand Legacy" received mixed reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the Windows release of the game has an average score of 67 out of 100 which indicates "mixed or average reviews", based on 10 reviews. "RPGFan" review illustrated this mixed sentiment, asserting that while the developers accurately recreated the feel of classic JRPGs, this mean they recreated much of the good and the bad parts of the genre, stating that "Although it clearly has its flaws, I enjoyed the roughly 40 hours I spent with it all the same...Semisoft wished to create a "love letter" to JRPGs, and perhaps it did that in a most unintentional way. "Legrand Legacy" manages to capture much of the indelible charm of the JRPGs to which it pays homage through its rough-around-the-edges execution."

Salmon-Trout

Salmon-Trout (also known as Salmon Trout 1921 – after 1938) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed very promising form as a two-year-old in 1923 when he won both of his races, namely the Prendergast Stakes and Dewhurst Stakes. In the following year he won four of his ten races including the Princess of Wales's Stakes and the St Leger as well as being placed in the Newmarket Stakes and the Champion Stakes. In 1925 he finished second in the Ascot Gold Cup. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in England and South Africa and had some success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Salmon-Trout was a big, powerful, good-looking bay horse bred in England by Marmaduke Furness, 1st Viscount Furness. As a yearling the colt was put up for auction at Doncaster and was bought for 3,000 guineas by George Lambton, acting on behalf of Aga Khan III. Salmon-Trout was sent into training with Dick Dawson at Whatcombe, near Lambourn in Berkshire.
He was sired by The Tetrarch an unbeaten horse who was regarded as one of the fastest two-year-old ever seen in Britain and Ireland, but whose career was ended by injury before he could race at three. The Tetrarch showed very little interest in his stud duties: his attitude towards sex was described as being "monastic in the extreme". Although he sired few foals his progeny included several major winners. Salmon-Trout's dam Salamandra was a top-class racemare, finishing third the 1000 Guineas and second in the Oaks Stakes in 1916, and a daughter of the 1000 Guineas winner Electra. Salamandra was bought by Lord Furness at Newmarket in December 1920 for 16,000 guineas with Salmon-Trout "in utero".
Racing career.
1923: two-year-old season.
Salmon-Trout made his first appearance in the five furlong Prendergast Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 October and "scrambled home" from Windward and St Germans. At the next Newmarket meeting he stepped up in class and distance for the Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs on 1 November. Ridden by G Hulme and starting at odds of 4/1, he led from the start and won "very comfortably" from Hurstwood.
At the end of the year Salmon-Trout was rated one of the Aga Khan's most promising juveniles, and in the official Free Handicap he was raked third behind his stablemates Mumtaz Mahal and Diophon. His two wins earned his owner £2,290.
1924: three-year-old season.
On his second-season debut, Salmon-Trout finished unplaced behind Green Fire the Greenham Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in April. Salmon-Trout bypassed the 2000 Guineas and instead won the Hastings Plate over ten furlongs at the same meeting. On 21 May the colt contested the Newmarket Stakes (a trial race for the Epsom Derby) over ten furlongs at Newmarket. In a slowly-run race which developed into a sprint in the final furlong, he was beaten a neck by Hurstwood, with Lord Derby's Sansovino a head away in third place and Bright Knight (the Derby favourite before the race) just behind in fourth. The 1924 Derby Stakes was run in exceptionally wet and testing conditions at Epsom Racecourse on 4 June. Salmon-Trout, who was regarded as the Aga Khan's second string behind the 2000 Guineas winner Diophon was never in contention and finished sixth behind Sansovino who won easily from St Germans and Hurstwood.
On his first appearance after his poor run in the Derby, Salmon-Trout contested the Princess of Wales's Stakes over one and a half miles on 3 July at Newmarket in which he was ridden by Vic Smyth and started at odds of 5/1. He won "in a canter" by three lengths and a head from Parmenio and Obliterate. He followed up by winning the Great Yorkshire Stakes over one and three quarter miles at York Racecourse in August. By this point in his career he was being described as a "sound stayer" but requiring careful training on account of his "delicate" legs. At Hurst Park, in his warm-up race for the St Leger, Salmon-Trout was partnered by Vic Smyth in the Richemount Three-Year-Old Stakes but failed to overhaul the improving Watford (ridden by Smyth's brother) and was beaten a head into second place.
In the 149th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Salmon-Trout was ridden by the Australian Bernard "Brownie" Carslake and started at odds of 6/1 in a field of seventeen runners. The complexion of the race was affected by an "epidemic of coughing" which ruled out Straitlace, Hurstwood and Bright Knight: Sansovino, St Germans, Polyphontes (Eclipse Stakes) and Salmon-Trout himself were also reportedly affected. Salmon-Trout was restrained at the rear of the field by Carslake and looked to have no chance of winning a furlong out as Santorb challenged the favourite Polyphontes for the lead. He then produced a remarkable turn of speed, took the lead in the closing stages, and crossed the finishing line two lengths clear of Santorb, with Polyphontes half length back in third. Before the race many bookmakers had lengthened their odds against Salmon-Trout on the basis of supposed "inside information" suggesting that the colt could not win, and some sustained heavy losses on the race as a result.
Later that month the colt reappeared in the Kinsclere Plate at Newbury, but was surprisingly beaten by the outsider Depatch. On his final appearance of the season, Salmon-Trout finished third behind the four-year-olds Pharos and Parth in the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket in October.
1925: four-year-old season.
Salmon-Trout remained in training as a four-year-old in 1925, with the Ascot Gold Cup as his principal objective. In the Gold Cup on 18 June he finished second to Santorb, beaten a length by the winner, with St Germans in third.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Salmon-Trout an "average" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
After his retirement from racing Salmon-Trout became a breeding stallion and stood in England for eleven years before being exported to South Africa in 1937. His last reported foals were born in 1938. The best of his offspring were King Salmon (Coronation Cup, Eclipse Stakes) and Salmon Leap (Coronation Cup, Goodwood Cup).

Matur Maker

Matur Maker (born 1 January 1998) is a South Sudanese-born Australian basketball player for the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League (NBL). He moved to Australia in his childhood and played for various prep schools in Canada and the United States, before forgoing college basketball. He is the younger brother of National Basketball Association (NBA) player Thon Maker and the cousin of basketball player Makur Maker.
Early life.
Maker was born in what is now known as South Sudan on 1 January 1998, with his older brother Thon Maker. In Matur's early childhood, his uncle, a local administrator, helped the family flee to Uganda amid a civil war in their home country. They then settled in Perth, Western Australia as refugees when Maker was four years of age but continued making occasional visits to South Sudan. Matur first started playing soccer at Grayhounds soccer club, a club where many south Sudanese kids played for and alongside his brother Thon. At age 13, Matur was discovered by basketball scout Edward Smith and began living with him in Sydney, before moving to the United States. After his parents were satisfied by the decision, Matur was allowed to join his brother in high school and Smith eventually became their legal guardian.
High school career.
Maker began playing high school basketball as a freshman at Carlisle School in Martinsville, Virginia, where he joined Thon, a sophomore, in the middle of the season. His guardian Edward Smith, who the brothers lived with in a two-story house, was an assistant coach for the team at the time. According to Smith, Matur's arrival at Carlisle helped Thon better acclimate to the United States. During his freshman season, Matur was considered one of the best high school players in the country at the small forward position. He helped Carlisle win a state championship and played with Team Loaded VA of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU).
For his sophomore year, Maker transferred from Carlisle, with Hopewell Academy in Cary, North Carolina and Orangeville Prep in Orangeville, Ontario as potential destinations. In September 2014, Maker and his brother enrolled at Orangeville Prep, where they played under head coach Larry Blunt and with fellow top prospect Jamal Murray. He was named Ontario Scholastic Basketball Association (OSBA) second-team all-star.
In 2016–17, Maker moved to The Tech Academy in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, where he was coached by his guardian Edward Smith and became teammates with cousin Makur Makur. With the Milwaukee Bucks having selected Thon at the 2016 NBA draft, the transfer allowed Matur to live closer to his brother. In April 2017, Maker competed in the BioSteel All-Canadian Basketball Game in Toronto, where he was named most valuable player. In the game, he recorded 25 points and six rebounds, shooting 8-of-11 from the field, playing only 12 minutes. At an adidas Nations event in August, he averaged 26 points and seven rebounds for the Asia Pacific team.
Maker played a postgraduate season of basketball at Mississauga Prep in Mississauga, Ontario for 2017–18. By 2018, he was averaging 25.5 points, 11.3 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 2.1 blocks and 1.7 steals. On 5 January 2018, Maker declared intentions to bypass college and enter the 2018 NBA draft, attempting to follow a similar path as his brother in 2016. He drew attention from scouts on 11 January, when he notched 45 points, 20 rebounds, two blocks, and three steals in a 95–85 defeat to GTA Prep. However, due to a lack of attention on his name during the 2018 NBA Draft process, he withdrew his name from the 2018 NBA draft on the 11 June international deadline.
Professional career.
Union Neuchâtel (2018).
On 7 August 2018, Maker signed with Union Neuchâtel of the Swiss Basketball League. Through 4 appearances, he averaged 5.8 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 0.8 assists in 13.9 minutes per game.
Zlatorog Laško (2018–2019).
On 30 December 2018, Maker signed with Zlatorog Laško of the Slovenian Basketball League. Maker played 17 games with Zlatorog and averaged 13ppg, 10rpg and lead his team to the playoffs.
Rio Grande Valley Vipers (2019–2020).
On 19 October 2019, Maker signed with the Houston Rockets of the NBA, but was waived the next day. Following this, Maker was added to the roster of the Rockets' NBA G League affiliate, the Rio Grande Valley Vipers.
Sydney Kings (2021–present).
On 27 August 2021, Maker signed with the Sydney Kings for the 2021–22 NBL season.

Hackett's Distillery

Hackett's Distillery was an Irish whiskey distillery which operated in Midleton, County Cork, Ireland between 1824 and circa 1845.
History.
Established in 1824 by the Hacketts, a wealthy local family, who had made their fortune in the tanning industry, Hackett's Distillery had a brief yet tumultuous existence.
Built at a cost of £20,000, the extensive operation included a distillery, a dwelling house, two flour mills, kilns, stores, and other buildings. Initially successful, by the 1830s the distillery was producing about 200,000 gallons of spirit per annum, with a payroll of 60.
However, success was not to last. The distillery incurred large debts, and likely suffered from falling demand due to the effects of Fr. Matthew’s Temperance Movement. Ironically, Fr. Matthew was in fact a close relative of the Hacketts, his brother being married to their sister. However, the nail in coffin for the distillery seems to have been an incident in 1842, which occurred after an Excise Officer visited the distillery late in the evening requesting that the gates be closed and the property inspected. The visit apparently incited an angry reaction from Bartholomew Hackett, one of the senior partners in the firm and present on site at the time. Though the precise events are unclear, the Excise Officer subsequently filed a suit against the Hacketts, alleging assault, and obstruction of an Excise Officer in the discharge of his duties, the latter of which was a serious charge for a distiller.
For reasons which were later disputed in court, the Hacketts did not file an official plea against the latter charge within the required timeframe, and were found guilty by default. The consequences of which were most severe: withdrawal of their license to distill, imposition of a large fine, and the forced sale of their distillery.
The distilling equipment, and 1,500 gallons (about 75 casks) of overproof spirits, and 1,800 gallons of “feints at proof” were advertised for sale in 1843. However, sale of the equipment does not seem to have proceeded, as the distillery was sold in “perfect working order” some years later.
In 1845, the Hacketts won a suit against their attorney, claiming that he had been negligent in failing to file a plea of “not guilty” against the charge of “obstruction”. They were awarded £250 and costs, an amount which paled in comparison with the loss of their investment in the distillery. A lengthy summary of the case was outlined in the 12 December 1845 edition of "The Cork Examiner".
In 1850, the distillery was sold in the “Incumbered Estates Court” (Bankruptcy Court) for the sum of £3,000, far below its reported value of £7,000. The winning bidder, a Mrs. O’Donoghue is thought to have been a sister of the Hacketts.
Although reported to have been sold in “perfect working order”, there is no record of distilling having resumed at the property. 
In the 1850s, the property again made its way into the “Incumbered Estates Court”, being purchased on this occasion by “Messrs. Allin”, who repurposed it for milling corn.
The decline in fortunes appears to have been most severe for Bartholomew Hackett. Reduced to near penury, he was prevented from seeking aid due to his social status. In 1853, he considered turning to smuggling illicit spirits to make ends meet. Later, he applied for a position as a distiller at Murphy’s Midleton Distillery. Murphy’s, a large enterprise which had opened in 1825, just months after Hackett’s, and the only other distillery in Midleton, had been their chief business rival. Writing himself, he noted that he would have to “sink all his pride in doing so”.

Optym

Optym is a privately held company founded in 2000 by Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja as Innovative Scheduling, Inc. The company headquarters is situated on 10 acres in Gainesville, Florida, and additional offices are located in Yerevan, Armenia; Bangalore, India; and Perth, Australia.
Optym provides transportation software and specializes in the optimization, simulation and analytics of transportation and logistics for railroad, trucking, airline and mining industries. Optym employs decision automation and optimization solutions. 
History.
Founding.
Optym was founded by researcher and academician Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja in 2000 as Innovative Scheduling, Inc., which rebranded as Optym in 2014.
Between 2004 and 2015, Optym was located at the Gainesville Technology Entrepreneurship Center (GTEC), a Santa Fe College-led business incubator. In 2015, the company moved its facility to the three-building Hillside Office Park off Tower Road in order to foster rapid expansion and hiring.
In 2018, Optym is a global company with over 275 workers offering solutions to a variety of companies, including Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, CSX Transportation and other major railroads in Canada and Europe, Toyota, Walmart, R+L Carriers, Office Depot and BHP. Optym licenses its suite of decision support systems, builds custom software applications for clients, develops new systems by funding internal research and provides technology-enabled consulting services using software solutions.
Financing.
Optym obtained its first Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant of $500,000 from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2004 to develop commercial software, specifically to build a decision support system addressing railroad blocking problems for CSX Transportation. It allowed Optym to hire its first set of full-time employees, including Krishna C. Jha, Wei Huang and Arvind Kumar, all of whom completed their Ph.D.’s at the University of Florida under Ahuja's guidance.
In 2005, Optym received its Phase II SBIR grant to build a decision support system for train
scheduling, and BNSF Railway provided a matching grant. These two grants, plus the licensing revenues from the product funded by the first NSF grant, provided continued funding for the research and development of optimization technologies for railroads. That year, Optym began building and commercializing its software solutions and investing profits into the research and development of new products.
Expansion.
Optym's Armenia office opened in 2007 in the capital city of Yerevan with the goal of conducting research and development of innovative IT techniques. This allowed Optym to package optimization and simulation engines into desktop and web- and map-based applications. The Armenia office currently has about 50 developers who specialize in the latest databases, applications and UI development technologies.
Optym started its development center in Bangalore, India, in 2013 with intentions to benefit from a large talent pool of computer engineers in optimization, machine learning, data analytics, data warehousing and software architecture. This location gave Optym a regional base to accommodate its growing list of global customers.
In 2014, Optym's office in Perth, Australia, opened to serve local mining clients, including BHP.
In 2017, Optym expanded its headquarters facility in Gainesville, Florida, by an additional 10,000 square feet to accommodate a growing workforce and expanding slate of projects. Due to rapid growth, Optym doubled its Gainesville team from approximately 60 employees in 2014 to 120 employees in 2017.
Rebranding.
Optym's current corporate identity is the result of a rebranding strategy initiated in 2014; Innovative Scheduling, Inc. changed its name to Optym, which is derived from the word “optimization,” supposedly to better reflect the expanding range of work, both in the products and services offered and the industries served. The rebranding effort also included a new logo and the new tagline, “Live Efficiently”.
Corporate affairs.
Expertise.
Optym combines business intelligence, which includes harvesting big data, data visualization and advanced data analytics, with employees’ knowledge as industry-specific experts as well as technical experts in operations research, information technology, data analytics, computer science and project management. Optym's team is adaptive and agile in developing and delivering complex network optimization capabilities.
Application developers create desktop and web applications, as well as mobile applications for iOS, Android and Windows platforms.
A close relationship between Optym and the University of Florida has resulted in the company frequently hiring former undergraduate and graduate students as interns and full-time employees.
Leadership.
Dr. Ravindra K. Ahuja is the founder and current CEO of Optym.
Dr. Krishna C. Jha is Executive Vice President of Optym. Jha joined Ahuja in 2000 as his doctoral student and transitioned to working with Optym as one of the company's first team members in 2004.

Dr. Arthur Ghulyan joined Optym in 2016 as Executive Director – Armenia Operations.
Ronda Lewis is Optym's Chief Revenue Office (CRO).
Convergence conference.
Optym hosted its first invitation-only Convergence conference in February 2015, providing an opportunity for leaders in the transportation and logistics industries to exchange ideas, learn more about each other's challenges and discuss upcoming products. Sixty executives from major rail, airline and trucking companies met at Optym's Gainesville, Florida, headquarters to discuss how to increase efficiency within the transportation and logistics industries.
During the second Convergence conference in Orlando, Florida, in April 2016, 120 executives from 15 countries and 50 companies, including American Airlines, United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, JetBlue, Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines; Amazon.com freight, FedEx Freight and UPS Freight; and BNSF Railway, CSX Transportation and Norfolk Southern Railway, met to discuss the conference's theme of Decision Automation. Leaders in the airline, trucking, railroad and logistics industries discussed ideas for solutions to rising costs and increasing business complexity, and Optym announced a new partnership with Amadeus. Keynote speeches were given by FedEx Freight strategic planning and engineering executives, Amazon.com’s Chief Scientist of Supply Chain and international speaker, business strategist and Gainesville local John Spence.
The third Convergence conference was held in Miami, Florida, in September 2017 and focused on the theme of Decision Optimization.
Hackathon.
Optym Armenia was the general sponsor and co-organizer of the Smarter Transportation Data Hackathon, which was a 24-hour event held in Yerevan, Armenia, on April 16, 2017. Thirty-three teams were selected to compete in three categories; չDNS team won for the category of most innovative solution with an existing functional prototype with a bicycle-sharing solution, Appress team won for the category of best business concept/idea with real-time decision optimization software for drivers and Babylon team won for the category of most valuable solution for Armenia with a smart food delivery platform based on machine learning.
Awards and recognition.
Optym was one of two finalists for Best Tech Company at the Gainesville Area Chamber of Commerce's Business of the Year Awards in 2015.
Products and services.
Optym creates disruptive technologies to provide network planning and scheduling solutions for numerous companies and agencies worldwide that heavily rely on transportation and logistics – from large airlines to trucking owner-operators to the City of Gainesville.
Sky.
Flight disruption is expected to become an increasingly expensive operational problem for airlines, airports and hotels to solve, motivating airline companies to invest in working with technology companies, such as Optym, to address disruption management.
In 2016, Optym and Amadeus IT Group entered into a long-term partnership to optimize Amadeus's flight scheduling, utilize its global network, technical sophistication and knowledge of the travel industry and unlock an additional 1-3% of current revenues, totalling millions of dollars. Optym's suite of network planning solutions for Amadeus can provide optimized schedules in a few hours rather than the previous delivery time of days to weeks. This suite is the first solution of its kind to be able to create a schedule from scratch, giving airlines greater strategic flexibility in an increasingly competitive airline market.
Amadeus SKY Suite by Optym is the first system that optimizes flight times, fleet types, thru-flights and aircraft routings simultaneously instead of separately. The Amadeus SKY Suite by Optym consists of SkyMAX for flight schedule optimization and maximizing profitability, SkySYM for schedule reliability simulation and reduction of operational costs related to aircraft flows, passenger flows, maintenance activities, weather patterns, ATC events and crew and baggage delays, SkyPLAN for route frequency optimization and maximizing revenue generation, SkyCAST for network schedule forecasting and projecting profitability and SkyWORKS for schedule management and increasing efficiency.
In 2015, Southwest Airlines began testing SkyMAX and using SkySYM to strengthen the operational reliability of flight schedules in relation to on-time arrivals, schedule recoverability and passenger connections.
Rail.
Optym received its first railroad project from CSX Transportation in 2004. It was tasked with optimizing locomotive planning function, and, in 2007, the collaboration resulted in the development of the real-time train scheduling system RailMAX. In addition to RailMAX, Rail by Optym consists of TrainMAX, CrewDESIGN, RailBIS, RailVIEWR, YardSYM, LocoMAX and YardMAX to automate decisions and simulate train movement, yard movement and locomotive assignment.
Haul.
Optym entered the trucking industry in 2011 when it started research to solve less-than-truckload (LTL) linehaul planning problems, which are considered some of the most difficult optimization problems due to the physical and liability limitations inherent in serving residential customers.
Haul by Optym, consisting of HaulPLAN and HaulVIEWR, was developed to solve these problems and address the increased urgency caused by growth in the e-commerce fulfilment industry. Several top LTL carriers expressed interest in and eventually licensed Optym's load plan creation and network optimization software product HaulPLAN in 2016.
To improve performance and reduce costs, YRC Freight and its subsidiaries use the load plan software, and FedEx uses Optym's haul scheduling software 
Mining.
In 2012, Optym entered the mining industry with the development of network simulation and optimization solutions for BHP. Optym first developed a solution to simulate the movement of trains in the rail network connecting mines to ports and then developed a real-time train scheduling system.
Urban.
DriverMAX was released in early 2017 and is a collaboration between Optym and Greyhound Lines to produce a software solution for driver route planning, which previously presented a significant efficiency challenge because it was done manually. The algorithm-based system incorporates human experience and insight to generate routes for over 1,000 drivers in less than one hour. Use of DriverMAX is expected to increase drivers’ wages, improve drivers’ quality of life and reduce Greyhound's operational costs by several million dollars annually. The success of DriverMAX presents opportunity for further collaborations between Optym and Greyhound's other areas of business

Mélovin

Kostyantyn Mykolayovych Bocharov (; born 11 April 1997), better known by his stage name Mélovin (stylised as MÉLOVIN; ), is a Ukrainian singer and songwriter. He first came to prominence after winning season six of "X-Factor Ukraine".
He represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal, with the song "Under the Ladder", finishing in seventeenth place, with 130 points.
Early life.
Bocharov was born in Odesa to parents Mykola Bocharov and Valentyna Bocharova. He became interested in music at a young age, and as a child would put on and perform in concerts at his school. He later began attending a music school, but left before graduating. He subsequently enrolled in a theatre school, which he graduated from.
Career.
2015–2016: "X-Factor Ukraine".
Bocharov had auditioned for "X-Factor Ukraine" three times, but never got onto the televised show. Eventually, he passed his audition for the show's sixth season in 2015. He advanced through the competition and was eventually declared the winner. Following the show's completion, he went on a tour of Ukraine along with the show's other finalists. In 2016, he released his debut single "Ne odinokaya".
2017–present: Eurovision attempts and new song(s).
On 17 January 2017, Bocharov was announced as one of the 23 competitors in "Vidbir 2017", the Ukrainian national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017, with the song "Wonder". Bocharov competed in the third semi-final on 18 February 2017, where he placed second and qualified to the final as one of the top two finishers. In the semi-final, he received the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public but only placed fourth with the jury consisting of Konstantin Meladze, Jamala, and Andriy Danylko. The final was held on 25 February 2017. Bocharov placed third, after receiving the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public again, but placing second-to-last with the jury.
The following year, Bocharov confirmed his return to "Vidbir" on 16 January 2018 after being confirmed as one of the 18 competing acts in "Vidbir 2018" with the song "Under the Ladder". He competed in the second semi-final on 17 February 2018, where he qualified to the final as one of the top three finishers, placing first with the highest number of televotes from the Ukrainian public and second-highest number of jury votes from the jury consisting of Jamala, Danylko, and Eugene Filatov. He won the final on 24 February and thus represented Ukraine in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 in Lisbon, Portugal. He placed 17th in the voting in Eurovision Song Contest 2018 final, gaining only eleven points from juries of 43 countries and 119 points from televiewers all around the world. After Eurovision 2018, he went on to release his new single "That's Your Role", which has had many views on YouTube.
Personal life.
On July 5, 2021, Melovin came out as bisexual in a concert, followed by an Instagram post. In a media interview, he said how he'd known about his sexuality since the age of 13. "I was brought up as a real man who will give way to a woman, give a hand, do not offend with a word, think before saying… I was raised as an adequate person," said the artist, "It's not a choice! It's not fashion! It's not hype! It's not against nature! It's the same love as all of you, but for the opposite sex. And I'm happy… I love people, not their genitals, which is sincere I wish you too! " he said.

Pan-European Pension

The Pan-European Pension Product (PEPP) or like Pan-European Personal Pension Product is a proposed pension which will be available to residents of the European Union. The PEPP is designed to give the 240 million savers in the EU a better choice in the fragmented and uneven European market, where options are nearly non-existent in some member states. PEPPs are regulated by the Regulation 2019/1238. This regulation lays the legal foundation for a single European market for personal pensions. The PEPP will be complementary to existing state, occupational and private pension systems on national level. After endorsement by the European Parliament and official adoption by the European Council the PEPP regulation was published in July 2019 and will enter into application in August 2020. The first PEPPs are expected to be offered in late 2021.
Valdis Dombrovskis, a vice-president of the European Commission responsible for financial services, said “It has enormous potential as it will offer savers across the EU more choice when putting money aside for retirement,” and “It will drive competition by allowing more providers to offer this product outside their national markets. It will work like a quality label and I am confident that the PEPP will also foster long-term investment in capital markets.” 
Jyrki Katainen, Vice-President responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness, added: “The agreement achieved by the European Parliament and the Council on PEPP is a major milestone on the road to addressing pension gaps and demographic challenges and a major achievement in completing Capital Markets Union. It will benefit consumers and providers with a strong framework for personal pensions through a new product with strong consumer protection and enhanced cross-border competition.”
Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), said: “The current macro-economic environment with persistent low and negative yields requires the rethinking of long-term retirement savings solutions. The implementation of the PEPP Regulation is an opportunity to build an appropriate regulatory basis for the design and monitoring of innovative and cost‑effective products that could enable European savers to reap the benefits of sustainable growth.”
The European Union is committed to fighting old-age poverty. Currently, only 27% of Europeans between 25 and 59 years old have enrolled themselves in a pension product. With the PEPP the EU is responding to changing demographics due to the aging of the population, the modern forms of labour, and embracing the opportunities of digitalisation. This PEPP is designed to give savers more choice and provide them with more competitive products, while enjoying strong consumer protection. Moreover, a more developed market for personal pensions in the EU will channel more savings into long-term investments and thus contribute significantly to develop a Capital Markets Union (CMU). According to a study by Ernst &amp; Young to the European commission personal pension assets under management in the EU28 are expected to grow from EUR 0.7 trillion in 2017 to EUR 1.4 trillion without PEPP and EUR 2.1 trillion with PEPP by 2030.
The PEPP offers additional incentives for people to save for their pension, alongside the occupational and state-based pensions available today. PEPPs will be available to all residents in one EU member state no matter if they are employed, unemployed, self-employed or studying. PEPPs could be particularly attractive to both mobile citizens and self-employed individuals who are not participating in state-based or occupational pension provisions.
A PEPP can be offered by all providers that fulfil certain criteria provided by the PEPP regulation, including insurance companies, banks, asset managers, certain investment firms and certain occupational pension funds (Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive 2016). A PEPP can be sold by investment firms authorised to provide investment advice, or any insurance intermediaries. To sell a PEPP, it is not mandatory for providers to be the designers of the product. It can be expected that traditional players such as insurance companies and asset managers will be among the first players to offer a PEPP. But PEPP could also be an opportunity for new FinTech players to enter the market with innovative solutions competing with more traditional providers such as insurance companies. The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) will maintain a central register in which it will register all PEPPs, this register will be made publicly available in electronic format.
Content.
The core elements of the PEPP are:
Digital disclosure and distribution: PEPP will be a modern product that can be distributed and purchased online, which will make it more attractive for young Europeans. The PEPP regulation explicitly allows either fully automated or semi-automated advice, this can help to reduce barriers to entry, create new cross-border opportunities, and ultimately reduce the costs of distributing the PEPP. 
Full transparency: Fees and costs will be transparent, disclosed via a simple Key Information Document (KID) supplied before the purchase, as well as a standardised pension benefits statement during the product lifetime.
Full mandatory advice: Consumers will also benefit from full mandatory advice (with a suitability test for all PEPP savers), to enable them to make an informed decision before purchasing a product. They will also benefit from personalised advice before retirement in order to choose the most suitable form of out-payments to their needs.
Cross-border portability: Providers will be able to offer PEPPs on a pan-European basis, allowing savers to continue saving in the same product, when they change residence across borders in the EU. In case portability is not available, consumers can switch providers free of charge or can continue to contribute to the PEPP of the previous country residence. However, PEPP can be offered only on the EU territory. 
A simple and affordable default option: All PEPP providers have to offer a simple and affordable default option called the “Basic PEPP”. For the Basic PEPP costs and fees capped at 1 % of the accumulated capital per year. The Basic PEPP will also offer capital protection to ensure that savers recoup the capital invested (without taking into account the impact of fees and inflation). 
A right to switch: PEPP savers will be able to switch provider or choose a different investment option after a minimum of five years from the conclusion of the contract and, in case of subsequent switches, after five years from the most recent switching. The PEPP provider may allow PEPP savers to switch investment options and providers more frequently.
Flexible payout: PEPP providers can offer PEPP savers one or several types of out-payments (annuities, lump sum, regular drawdown payments, "Tontine"-style drawdown payments or a combination of these). Savers will be able to choose the form of out-payments for the decumulation phase when opening an account. If available, savers will be allowed to modify the form of out-payments. Member States may incentivise different forms of out-payments. 
Sustainable investment: Providers are encouraged but not forced to take into account environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in their investment decisions. Given the expected market size and the long-term nature of pension products, PEPP could contribute significantly to the EU sustainability agenda in the financial sector.
The PEPP saver can choose between a maximum of six investment options. All providers have to offer a “Basic PEPP”. The Basic PEPP is a simple, affordable and safe default option providing a level playing field among providers and full transparency for savers. For the Basic PEPP costs and fees capped at 1 % of the accumulated capital per year. This includes all costs for administration, asset management and distribution. Any costs linked to additional features (e.g. payment in case of death) or a capital guarantee that are not required shall not be included in the cost cap. The basic PEPP aims at preserving the savers capital at retirement and cover the contributions during the accumulation phase after deduction of all fees and charges. Depending on the type of capital protection there will be two types of basic PEPP. For the Basic PEPP with a guarantee (type 1), providers will have a legal obligation to ensure that PEPP savers recoup at least the capital invested. The Basic PEPP with other risk mitigation techniques (type 2) shall be consistent with the objective to allow the PEPP saver to recoup the capital, but without any legal obligation to recoup the capital. 
The PEPP does not cover tax incentives. It is up to the member states to offer any tax incentives or not. In order to create a level playing field for PEPP and existing national pension products the European commission encourages the member state to grant PEPP savers the same tax treatment as similar existing national personal pension products.
Regulation.
PEPP providers will be supervised by national authorities. The distribution regime of the PEPP follows a sectorial approach. Insurance companies and insurance intermediaries that distribute a PEPP will be subject to the Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD), while investment firms and other PEPP providers and distributors will have to apply the provisions of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).
The European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) is mandated to ensure a consistent implementation and supervisory of PEPP. EIOPA develops technical standards for implementation and supervisory, runs the central register of all PEPP products, monitors the evolution of the market and can even issue a temporary ban or restriction on specific PEPPs under certain conditions. EIOPA has established an Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP. The objectives of the Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP are to inform EIOPA's policy work, to test policy proposals and to act as sounding board for EIOPA. The panel consists of high-level experts with a diverse set of experiences and expertise, from insurance companies, asset managers, NGOs and universities. Member of the Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP
In December 2019 EIOPA launched a public consultation on its approaches for regulating key aspects of the PEPP. The Consultation Paper sets out EIOPA's current stances to approach the regulation of key aspects of the PEPP. In developing the proposals, EIOPA sought input from the supervisory community of the insurance and pension sectors, the other European Supervisory Authorities, and conducted an active dialogue with EIOPA's stakeholder groups and the Expert Practitioner Panel on PEPP. Gabriel Bernardino, Chairman of EIOPA, said: “EIOPA invites all stakeholders to contribute to this consultation in order to ensure that the PEPP will be a success for the benefit of European citizens”. Key topics addressed in the public consultation are:
Timeline.
The idea of a single European market for private pensions is part of the European Commission's plan to strengthen the Capital Markets Union (CMU) by creating a single market for capital in the EU. The history of PEPP dates back to 2013 when the European Commission tasked the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) to work towards a single European market for personal pensions. This resulted in a preliminary report on a single European market for personal pensions published in 2014. In September 2015, the European Commission launched the Capital Markets Union (CMU) Action in order to build a true single market for capital across the EU member states. In this, the European Commission called for an exploration of ways to support personal retirement savings with the appropriate level of consumer protection and build and a single EU market. Based on the results of a public consultation, in July 2016 the EIOPA issued advice with a proposal for a standardised Pan-European Personal Pension Product (hereafter “PEPP”) as a complementary option alongside national regimes. As a result, the European commission published a proposal for a regulation on a PEPP in 2017. The proposal was accompanied by a recommendation to the Member States on the tax treatment of personal pension products and a study on the feasibility of a European Personal Pensions Framework conducted by EY. The legislative proposal was discussed and further developed by the co-legislators. After endorsement by the European Parliament and official adoption by the European Council the PEPP regulation was published on 25 July 2019. In the year after the publication, the Commission will work together with EIOPA on an effective implementation of the PEPP. The PEPP Regulation will enter into application 12 months after the publication on 14 August 2020. As a regulation it applies directly in all EU member states with no need for implementation to domestic legislation. Only in case a member state would like to grant PEPP a favourable tax treatment, national law might need to be amended. The first PEPPs will be offered in late 2021 or early 2022.
PEPP Providers.
On 10th June 2021, EIOPA Executive Director Fausto Parente stated that "immediately after the application date, which is 22 March 2022, there will be around 13 players ready to offer a product and, by and large, 50 players are considering to launch a PEPP during the first two years”. This list is thought to include the following:
Challenges.
There are critics that the final regulation “has been stripped of its initial ambition” as “key elements of the proposal were diluted, or replaced, in response to pressure from member states and organisations” and that “it has become an insurance rather than a savings product as there is always a guaranteed element involved”.
The EU commission has proclaimed the European Green Deal to make Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050. A core part of it is the European Green Deal Investment Plan, which will mobilise at least €1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade. PEPP providers are encouraged to allocate all or a significant part of their assets to sustainable investments. Furthermore, they are encouraged to consider ESG (environmental, social and governance) factors in investment decisions. But there is no obligation to invest your money sustainably. Critics demand, that “PEPP could be a key to achieve the goal of €1 trillion of sustainable investments by making sustainable investments mandatory for all PEPPs”.
The PEPP might have limited impact on local pension markets. PEPP has to compete with local pension products. In June 2018, the European Federation of Financial Advisers and Financial Intermediaries (FECIF) warned that Europe is still not dealing with the tax treatment of Pan European Pension Products. Secretary general Simon Colboc said “the biggest question facing PEPPs is the tax treatment it will receive and that is the main question people are asking and it is the elephant in the room.” Whether the PEPP will receive similar tax incentives as local products will depend on the member state. Critics argue that the tax element is crucial if it is going to take off, meaning that contributions should be tax exempt, and that this will make or break the PEPP. Also many European countries already have a wide range of well established personal pension products, so PEPP might become more relevant in countries with less developed pensions systems.

Metastoma

The metastoma is a ventral single plate located in the opisthosoma of non-arachnid dekatriatan chelicerates such as eurypterids, chasmataspidids and the genus "Houia". The metastoma located between the base of 6th prosomal appendage pair and may had functioned as part of the animal's feeding structures. It most likely represented a fused appendage pair originated from somite 7 (first opisthosomal segment), thus homologous to the chilaria of horseshoe crab and 4th walking leg pair of sea spider. In eurypterids, the plate was typically cordate (heart-shaped) in shape, though differed in shape in some genera, such as "Megalograptus".

Kostela

Kostela (Kastel) is a settlement and tourist resort next to the River Una in the municipality of Bihać in Bosna i Hercegovina. It borders Pokoj and Srbljani.
History.
Name and origin.
The etymology of the word Kostela drags its roots since ancient Illyria , Iapodes and the Roman castellum.
Kastel or kȁstrum (lat .: "castrum" , Eng .: "castle") is the name of an ancient fort and established a military settlement; camp; especially along the lines of the defensive limes. The original meaning of the term comes from the Roman era, from a legion camp surrounded by ramparts and towers, which was built according to certain rules – the Roman castrum. In the mature antique era, castras are particularly important in the defense system.
Illyrian and Roman period.
The Romans divided the Illyric province into the provinces of Pannonia and Dalmatia, which belonged to the almost entire Iapodian country, where they were in the 1st century BC. some smaller military units were deployed: one unit of Ala Claudia Nova was in near Bihac around 70 years of new era, and a smaller patrol was in the Kostela at the ending of the river Una from the Bihac field, probably at a place suitable for the passage (in the name of the settlement, the memory was preserved to the Roman castle).
Mythology.
The origins of this Bihać settlement are mostly related to two legends: the one about the king of aquatic creatures and those about the slaves who have lost their lives in digging a hill to make a flow for the river.
Several miles downstream of Bihać is the village of Kostela, which, according to folk tales, has always been the most beautiful settlement next to river Una. Many legends are linked to its creation, and the ones that are saved are those about aquatic creatures and the penetration of the canyon.
The people recounted that once there was a large lake in the area of today's Bihac and there were aquatic creatures in it. There was hostility between them and the people, and the king of the aquatic creatures wanted to bring people down to themselves. But the people were smarter and more resourceful, and they dug through the canyon through which the lake collapsed, leaving only the river – today's Una. All the watery creatures died, only their king who was hiding in the Una was left alone, and later they defeated him too.
The folk tales from Kostela say that long time ago whole Bihać was under the water and people one day decided to dig a hill on border between Pokoj and Kostela, and by that to make a flow for the river and to settle in the valley of Bihać. When they finished digging a large wave of wild river Una soak in people and took most of them. After that, when the river has calmed down people found bones of drowned diggers in Kostela.
"Explanation: in Bosnian lang. Kost=Bone in English."
Recent history.
The settlement is known for its mills, many stories and legends. The legend says the locals from the Spahići settlement, located above Kostela, descended to the plain, because their homes were burned in World War II. When the war ended, people had no where to go, so they settled down the river Una. On the river, they built the mills and survived working as millers. After World War II Kostela was one of the most important places in town Bihać because of innovators who made many waterworks facilities like sawmills, and mills in which people from other cities came to grind flour. And later in war that was in period of 1991–1995, settlement Kostela was again the most important place in Bihać because of hydroelectric power station Hidroelektrana Una Kostela that delivered electricity in important institutes like: hospitals, military barracks...etc. and with that saved many lives.

Museo Experimental El Eco

The Museo Experimental El Eco is a contemporary art gallery in the centre of Mexico City, Mexico. It was designed by sculptor Mathias Goeritz, a Mexican artist of German origin who worked closely with the Mexican architect Luis Barragán. Originally built in 1952–53, the gallery was extended by FR-EE/Fernando Romero Enterprise in 2007 "to expand its offices and special services to improve daily operations".
History of the building.
In 1952, businessman Daniel Mont commissioned artist Mathias Goeritz to build a place that would articulate a new relationship between his commercial interests of a restaurant-bar and the avant-garde spirit of some cultural actors of the time, with the intention of finding something different from what was established. Under the premise "do whatever you want", Goeritz conceived the space on Sullivan Street in Mexico City. It was designed as a poetic structure whose layout of corridors, ceilings, walls, rooms and openings led its visitors to reflect their experience of space in an emotional act; This concept challenged the dominant interests of functionalism in architecture at that time. Based on his "Manifesto of emotional architecture", his writings also refer to inspiration of religious experiences and Gothic and Baroque architecture.
Goeritz conceived the building as a penetrable sculpture. This space was the creation of an unprecedented platform for the arts in the context of Mexican and international art of the 1950s.
In 2004, the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México bought the building which re-opened its doors on 7 September 2005 after many months of restoration work to bring the building back to its original state. The project was intended to revive Goeritz's architectural legacy.
Pabellón Eco.
In 2008, the museum initiated a national architecture competition to continue the legacy of spatial experimentation that hosts an interdisciplinary art program. The project offers a platform for young Mexican architects and is co-produced with Buró—Buró, an independent non-profit cultural office. The museum also organizes a conference around experimental architecture called Pabellón Eco: Panorama.

Harold Anson

Harold Anson (1867 – 1954), was an English Anglican priest, most notably Master of the Temple from 1935 until his death.
Notes.

Lövsele

Lövsele is a village in Lövånger socken in Skellefteå Municipality, Västerbotten County, Sweden. The village is located by the European route E4 about south of Lövånger.
History.
Until 1951, the village's name was Kräkånger. "Kräk" is thought to be derived from a dialectal word meaning "sharp angle" or "small bay", and is related to modern Swedish "krok" ("hook") and "krök" ("bend"), while "ånger" in Swedish place names typically means "bay". The name may refer to the bay which historically (around 500AD) stretched from Lövånger to Bureå, forming a sharp angle with what was at the time the Lövånger Fjard.
As cars were becoming commonplace in the 1940s, the name, and that of neighbouring village Kräkångersnoret (now Södra Lövsele), attracted ridicule from visitors due to the modern Swedish associations it suggests: "kräk[as]" means "[to] vomit", "ånger" means "regret", and "snor[et]" means "[the] snot". As a result, the local population expressed their wishes to change the name, and the new name Lövsele was formed from "sele", referring to the nearby lake Selet (the remnants of the fjard from which the earlier name had been derived), and "löv", referring to Lövånger parish.

Thomas Charles Wright

Thomas Charles Wright (1799–1868) was an Irish-born naval admiral that was a founding-father of the Ecuadorian Navy, and a general in Simón Bolívar's army. He is noted as a leading militarist in the struggle for the independence of Ecuador and other South American countries. 
Childhood.
Thomas Wright was born in Queensboro, Drogheda, Ireland, on 26 January 1799, the son of Joseph Wright and Mary Montgomery. At the age of 11 he was sent to the Royal Navy college at Portsmouth, at that time regarded as the finest in the world, where he studied to become an officer.
Career in the Royal Navy.
Following his junior office training, he embarked to sea at the age of 14 on board under the captaincy of George Stuart. On this vessel he sailed to the east coast of the United States where he was engaged in blockading activities in the squadron of Admiral Borlaise Warren. In 1817 he returned to England having attained the junior officer's rank of midshipman.
South American campaigns for independence.
With promotional opportunities diminishing in the Royal Navy, Wright having passed the Lieutenant's examination, but still without a commission, in union with many young junior officers in Britain he decided to enlist in Simón Bolívar's revolutionary army and sail for South America in support of the uprisings against Spanish colonial rule. In November 1817 Wright enlisted as an officer in the British Legion of Simón Bolívar, under the patronage of Luis Lopez Mendez, Bolivar’s agent in London, he was one of the first to volunteers to enlist. Originally setting off from the River Thames in November 1817, several snags delayed the departure until 2 January 1818 then departing from Fowey harbour he sailed on a brigantine named "Dowson", under naval commander Captain Dormer, with 200 other volunteers armed with valuable weapons and ammunition, and after several weeks they landed at the West Indies.
In this army corps of 200 men he was under the command of Colonel Campbell, and they were known as the Rifles Corps. These troops were then placed under the command of Colonel Pigott – His Majesty 54th Foot. Admiral Brion arrived with his squadron on the Island of St Thomas and Pigott and his followers were shipped on Patriot vessels to Margarita Island off the coast of Venezuela arriving on 21 April 1818.
They were sent to Guayana and then to Angostura, thus beginning the campaign in the Apure. At Angostura (present-day Ciudad Bolívar Wright first met Simón Bolívar, for whom he developed a deep admiration. Bolívar opened the liberating campaign in Apure. During 1818–1819, one of his earliest battles with Wright partaking as an officer was at Trapiche de Gamarra on 27 March 1819. These encounters inspired Bolívar to begin his New Granada campaign and the march over the Andes. Wright accompanied Bolívar on the legendary crossing on which 25% of the British/Irish troops died.
He took part in the entire land campaign to liberate the northern countries of South America, and fought with in numerous land battles with Bolívar's army, including, Pantano De Varges on 25 July, the Battle of Boyacá on 7 August 1819, Cienega de Santa Martha on 10 November 1820, and the Battle of Carabobo on 24 June 1821. Further battles included Bombona on 7 April 1822 and Pasto in September 1822.
Wright was to play leading roles in the Battle of Vargas Swamp, and later in the victory at Boyacá in August 1819, after which he was promoted to captain. In 1820 he returned with his Rifles regiment to the coastal plains to campaign in the jungles east of the Magdalena against the Spanish based on Santa Marta. He fought at the Battle of Ciénaga on 10 November 1820, the outcome resulted in the capture of the town. The Rifles Corp were then transported by sea to Maracaibo, and on 21 June 1821 partook in Simon Bolívar's decisive victory at Carabobo. Cartagena was also seized and the Rifles were brought in boats up the Magdalena en route to Popayán. They formed part of the forces led by Bolívar in the second of his famed Andean campaigns. After the successful battle at Bomboná on 7 April 1822, Wright was twice mentioned in Bolívar's order of the day for his exceptional skill and courage. Again he was promoted and from February 1822 Wright was acting lieutenant-Colonel, a rank to which was later confirmed in 1823, when he was serving under General Sucre, who joined up forces with Bolívar in Ecuador.
In 1823 the Rifles were shipped to Peru.
Independence struggle and naval battles.
In early 1824, Bolívar knew that despite the Patriot Army success on land unless the South American revolutionary armies could control the seas off their coasts they would forever be under sea blockade from imperial Spain. General Bolivar appointed Wright to the newly fledged united pacific naval squadron.
After Guayaquil seized independence, a young British naval officer John Illingworth Hunt, was appointed as Commanding General of the Maritime Department. Immediately he took care of organizing everything concerning the Navy, The new government was acquiring some ships indispensable for the maintenance of the Grancolombiana sovereignty in the Pacific. Thus, in 1823, the first Ecuadorian naval force was formed with the following warships; the schooner "Guayaquileña", the brig "Chimborazo" and the corvette "Pichincha".
Wright, who in February 1824 was promoted to captain, became Commodore of the South Squadron, and embarked on the brig "Chimborazo", where he had his flag pennant hoisted, and conducted patrols along the Peruvian coast with seven transports properly equipped and ready to assist in the transfer of troops, when Bolívar, who was with his army in Peru, would require it. Bolívar with his army defeated the royalist forces at the Battle of Junín on 6 August 1824. After this, Wright was instructed to proceed to Callao with a squadron of five ships and was placed under the orders of Admiral Martin Guise, head of the United Squadron.
The Grancolombian units, forming this squadron, participated in some naval actions against the royalists and also in the blockade of Callao, the last Spanish stronghold in South America.
Bolívar installed him as a Commodore of the Pacific Southern Squadron, He was appointed to command this small fleet of ships including "Chimborazo", "Guayaquileña", "Pichincha", and other minor vessels in support of Admiral Martin Guise and joined the Patriotic naval force blockading off Callao. Wright, Admiral Martin Guise, and a handful of other former Royal Navy officers spearheaded the blockade of Callao that successfully fought the Spanish naval squadron sent to lift the blockade of the besieged city. The first ship under his command was "Guayaquileña", formerly "Lady Collier". During the blockade the Spanish royalist ships based in Callao tried to run the blockade and escape, and became engaged in combat with the blockading fleet. He was highly praised for his action. During the exchanges Wright's brigantine "Chimborazo" sustained three water-line hits and collided with the ship 'Asia', but he prised himself free and escaped. The blockade held and Callao capitulated in early 1826 and Spanish rule in South America was at a close. During this period Wright on "Chimborazo" had become personally close to Bolívar and he ferried him from port to port over the entire Pacific coast. Bolívar while at sea was at most risk of capture and at his most vulnerable and his aides strongly advised against these sea voyage risks. Despite this Bolívar continued to sail with Wright one of his original officers on voyages from port to port.
Founding father of the Ecuadorian Navy.
The revolutionary independence struggles ended with the unfolding liberation of South America countries, and Wright settled in Ecuador where he helped establish the Ecuadorian Navy and helped create the Ecuadorian naval school that was named in his honour.
Post independence war with Peru.
The downfall and expulsion of the Spanish colonial power later led to land disputes and new wars among the South American home nations that once were united against Spain. In 1827, Peruvian President José Lamar invaded Bolivia, then invaded Ecuador.
Wright had settled in Ecuador after the ousting of the Spanish, and now he took up the cause of defending his new adopted homeland. Wright's navy fought two battles with the Peruvians in the Gulf of Guayaquil.
Battle of Punta Malpelo.
President Bolívar resolved to declare war against Peru on 3 June 1828. Antonio José de Sucre, who had been the President of Bolivia since 1826, resigned his office (under duress) and was appointed Commander of the Gran Colombian Army.
The Peruvian declaration of war against Gran Colombia occurred on 3 July 1828 when the Peruvian Government, under President Jose de La Mar, ordered a mobilization of its ground and naval forces. The first engagement of the conflict took place on 31 August of that year when the Peruvian corvette "Libertad", under the command of Carlos García del Postigo, on patrol in international waters to the west of the Gulf of Guayaquil with the purpose of blockading that port, was attacked by the Gran Colombian ships "Pichincha" and "Guayaquileña" under the command of Thomas Charles Wright, off Punta Malpelo. During the battle both sides were forced to disengage with heavy loss of life on board their vessels. Wright was injured in the fighting as was Postigo who was severely wounded and fled, and the blockade on the city was lifted.
Assault on Guayaquil.
The Peruvian squadron, commanded by Admiral Jorge Martin Guise, made a number of raids in the area of Guayaquil before directly attacking the defenses of that city from 22 November to 24 November 1828. In this campaign, he managed to eliminate the Ecuadorian/Colombian defenses afloat and to silence much of the enemy artillery, but, on the night of 23 November, the Peruvian frigate "Presidente" ran aground, and the Colombians took advantage of the situation to counterattack.
At dawn, with the arrival of high tide, the frigate was refloated under fire. One of the last enemy sniper shots hit Guise, mortally wounding him. Control of the squadron was assumed by his first lieutenant, José Boterín, who continued the siege. The city finally surrendered on 19 January 1829. After this victory, the corvette "Arequipeña" and the brig "Congreso" repaired to Panama to rescue a Peruvian merchant ship that had been captured by the Gran Colombians. Guayaquil would remain under Peruvian occupation until 21 July 1829.
Return to the army.
In 1829 he went back in the army he was as a Colonel, appointed General Sucre's Aid de Camp at Portete de Tarqui.
Independence of Ecuador.
Equador declared itself a republic in 1830, though the region was completely unsettled with Peru and Colombia both claiming parts of Ecuador as part of their territory. At this time he went back in the Navy (with his own flag officer's pendant). He was also appointed to the army with the rank of General of Brigade in 1830.
Civil war.
Two unconstitutional presidents had declared themselves in office – Rocafuerte and Valdivieso. Wright and Flores led Rocafuerte's army into a decisive battle that took place at Minarica in 1835. This action was decisive and they defeated General Barriga, who was Valdivieso's appointed General. The victory guaranteed the stability and future of Ecuador, with Rocafuerte becoming Ecuador's president.
Admiral of the Fleet and Army General.
In 1835, he was Comandante del Apostadero, later changed to Comandancia General de la Marina for many years. Translated to English, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy. He did not found the Ecuadorian Naval School as often incorrectly cited. The college was named after him. He was the commanding officer of the Ecuadorian Naval Squadron before Ecuador became a Republic, as such he is considered a founding father of the Ecuadorian Navy. In this year he was also promoted to Army General of Division.
Military coup and exile.
In 1845, a military coup plot overthrew the liberal government supported by Wright and he went into exile in Chile and Peru He went into exile for fifteen years, ten years in Chile and five in Peru. In Chorrillos, Peru he befriended the Ecuadorian exile Eloy Alfaro and exerted a massive influence on him as a mentor. He would later become President from 1897–1913. he returned from exile in 1860 and opposed Garcia Moreno until his death.
Governor of Guayaquil.
In 1843 he became the Governor of Guayaquil. This was the premier military position in the city.
Family and marriage.
He married the President's niece Angela Rico y Rocafuerte and had five children. He was widowed in 1839. He then married Maria Josefa Rico y Rocafuerte in 1844. (She was fondly called Pepita).

Raffles (cigarette)

Raffles (also known as Players in the United States) was a British brand of cigarettes which was owned and manufactured by Philip Morris USA in the U.S. and by Philip Morris International outside of the U.S.
History.
In August 2001, Imperial Tobacco announced that it had entered into an agreement with Philip Morris International for the distribution and sale of Marlboro, Raffles and Chesterfield cigarettes in the U.K.
In May 2011, the name of the brand was changed from Raffles to Virginia S by Raffles. At the time, a pack of 20 cigarettes costed £6.76.
Xavier Ducarroz, Marketing Director at Philip Morris said the following about the name change: "Raffles continues to be a successful range, but we were conscious that the brand needed to be refreshed. Virginia S. offers the same classic taste that adult smokers of Raffles have grown to love with a much more modern, contemporary look and feel".
Advertising.
Various poster and magazine adverts were made to promote the brand in the 1980s and 1990s.
A lighter and toiletries with the Raffles logo were also made.
Philip Morris International would introduce various special offers during the 1980s and 1990s via many leaflets. If you bought a pack or a carton of Raffles cigarettes, you would get a free Tumbler glass, a T-shirt, a cafetière, a Wallet and so on.

Donna M. Brinton

Donna M. Brinton (1948) is an American applied linguist, author, and global educational consultant on second language education. She is the daughter of Mary Mies Brinton and Robert K. Brinton and the sister of epidemiologist Louise A. Brinton and linguist Laurel J. Brinton.
Academic career.
Brinton graduated with dual B.A. degrees in Comparative Literature and German Language and Literature from the University of California, Berkeley (1970). Subsequent to this, she completed M.A. degrees in German from Purdue University in 1972 and in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1981. Her early career in English as a second or foreign language (ESL/EFL) took place in Germany from 1972-1976.
For the bulk of her academic career, Brinton worked at the University of California, Los Angeles in a variety of positions, including Associate Director of the UCLA Center for World Languages, Lecturer in Applied Linguistics, and Academic Coordinator of the UCLA ESL Service Courses. She later worked as Professor of TESOL at Soka University of America and as Senior Lecturer in the Rossier School of Education at the University of Southern California (USC) designing and teaching online classes in the MAT-TESOL program. In addition to teaching numerous applied linguistics and TESOL classes, Brinton is a prolific author of books and articles in the field as well as frequent presenter at national and international conferences. She has made a name for herself in the areas of second language pronunciation pedagogy, content-based instruction (CBI), and general TESOL methodology. She is also known to the wider applied linguistics community as a long-term editor of "The CATESOL Journal", a publication of the California Association of Teachers of English to Speakers to Other Languages. To pre-service teachers, she is most widely known for her teacher reference texts, the 2010 "Teaching Pronunciation: A Reference and Course Text" (2nd. ed".," with others")," the 2014 "Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language" (4th ed., with others) and the 2017 Content-based Classroom (2nd ed., with Marguerite Ann Snow).
Several of her works highlight an approach to language teaching known as content-based instruction (CBI), in which the new language is the medium of instruction, so that the language and content are taught simultaneously. This takes advantage of the connectedness of the form and function of language.
Women in linguistics.
Brinton is among the first generation of female applied linguists that came to the fore in significant numbers, having been academically socialized in the 1970s. While women were working in the field earlier than the 1970s, her generation was really the first to tip the balance more favorably for women.
International work.
As a TESOL teacher educator and educational consultant, Brinton has worked across the globe, often as a U.S. Department of State English language specialist, assigned to such locations as Qatar, the U.A.E., Bahrain, Afghanistan, Iraq, Nepal, India, the Philippines, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, Singapore, the Republic of South Korea, Taiwan, Canada, Mexico, Guatemala, Bolivia, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay, Greece, Turkey, Israel, Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Algeria, South Africa, Mozambique, Madagascar, Mauritius, Senegal, Mali, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Syria, Lebanon, Curaçao, and as a visiting faculty member at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand and Toyo University, Kanda University, and Soka University in Japan.
