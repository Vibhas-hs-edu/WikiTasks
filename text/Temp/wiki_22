Bertha M. Wilson

Bertha M. Wilson (August 14, 1874 – 1936) was an American dramatist, critic, and dramatic actress, who earned a reputation throughout the Central United States. She leased some of her monologues, sketches, drills, and plays to educators and professionals. Her own work was of three kinds: home talent entertainments, including original drills, tableaux, and pantomimes; plays and farces; and costume monologues for platform and stage. "Wilson's Book of Drills and Marches for Young People and Small Children" was published in 1895.
Education.
Bertha May Wilson was born in Missouri, August 14, 1874. Her father, Isaac Wilson was born in Maryland, April 24, 1824, while the mother's birth occurred in Canada on August 15, 1834. They came to Hamilton County, Iowa when Allen, the youngest in a family of nine, was a month old. In order of birth the other children were as follows: Elizabeth Jane (1854-1863), Jeanette Lamont (1855-1876), Lucy Agnes Hogan-Hohlwegler (1857-?), David Carlton (1859-1863), Joseph Lincoln (1860-?), Lillie Daugherty (1863-?), Minty May (1870-1872), and George Sears (1871-1873). The first five were natives of Illinois and the last named of Missouri. The father, who was a farmer, was for many years identified with the agricultural interests of Hamilton county, but he was living in Blairsburg, Iowa at the time of his death, which occurred January 20. 1905. The mother passed away on March 12, 1900.
Wilson was awarded a Bachelor of Arts degree from State University of Iowa in 1892. She also received a degree of Master of Arts. As a student she excelled in languages and literature, and won many prizes in those branches. Indeed, it was the study of classic drama in the original Greek and Latin that first interested her in this phase of literature. She was the special pupil of Helen Potter.
Career.
For her own amusement, Wilson began analyzing the writings of various dramatists, from the classics to the modern French and English schools, studying plot, style, treatment, and dramatic situation. Later, she tried paraphrasing and rearranging, and finally drifted into original production. Her own work was of three kinds: home talent entertainments, including original drills, tableaux, and pantomimes; plays and farces; and costume monologues for platform and stage, which was her specialty. Wilson's work was distinguished for its dramatic conception, its vividness, originality and unaffectedness. While artistic, it was written with vigor and directness. Most of it had the test of public presentation, either in home talent entertainments under her own supervision for the purpose of studying effects and gaining experiences in stage management, or in her own programs.
Wilson’s experiences and painstaking study fitted her for the role of dramatic critic as well as writer. She wrote for many popular magazines and papers under different pseudonyms, and many publishers offered to handle her dramatic work.
Manuscripts.
Wilson's manuscripts included monologues, sketches, drills and plays. In the 1894 season, she leased her various manuscripts to readers, actors, societies, and companies. For several years, Wilson successfully superintended in person the leasing of her manuscripts, her leasing plan fitting a special demand for those seeking something new. By keeping a sketch in manuscript form and leasing it at a price higher than the printed sketch and yet at a price not beyond the means of the average teacher or entertainer, kept it from being over-used. Entertainers preferred to "lease by the season," or have sketches written specially for them. Teachers and students favored the plan of leasing five or six different manuscripts for a single performance making a full evening's program. The manuscripts were open to examination before leasing on the payment of a examination fee which was deducted from the regular leasing fee in case the manuscript was accepted. The list of manuscripts included the dramatic, pathetic, comedy, farce, pantomime, and the spectacular. Wilson oversaw all correspondence and was ready to offer suggestions or aid in selecting a sketch suited to someone‘s special purpose.
Personal life.
In 1899, she married Herbert F. Allen. They were Congregationalists in religious faith, and assisted in the work of the various organizations of the local church of that denomination.
Style.
"A Chinese Wedding" was arranged as a costume pantomime in seven scenes, for ten male and ten female characters, with as many additional ones as desired. This pantomime could be easily produced and had a duration of twenty-five minutes. The scenes gave a vivid and faithful picture of everything pertaining to the wedding ceremony in China in that period.
"The Christmas Star" was a monologue for a young lady, lasting twenty minutes, with easy scenery and costumes. It was a story of a country maid whose musical talent is discovered bv an unexpected visitor who comes on a Christmas Eve. Through his influence, she is brought before the public, develops into a musical wonder, and later, marries him.

Gaeltacht Act 2012

The Gaeltacht Act 2012 () is an Act of the Oireachtas of Ireland. The Act redefined the traditional Irish-speaking areas or "Gaeltacht" in the Republic of Ireland on linguistic criteria instead of on geographic areas which had been the position until 2012. While the traditional "Gaeltacht" boundaries still exist the Act sets out ways where areas outside the "Gaeltacht" can be formally designated as Líonraí Gaeilge (Irish Language Networks) and Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta (Gaeltacht Service Towns). In 2016 it was announced that Galway City, Dingle and Letterkenny would be the first recognised Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 subject to them adopting and implementing approved language plans. In February 2018 the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and "Foras na Gaeilge" announced that five areas- Belfast, Loughrea, Carn Tóchair, Ennis and Clondalkin- were going to be designated as the first formal Líonraí Gaeilge areas under the Act. 
 Foras na Gaeilge have said that they expect the status to be given to other areas also. 
The Act also brought the process of the introduction of Language Plans in the Gaeltacht into existence and gave statutory effect to the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 by Údarás na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht and changed the process by which the board of Údarás na Gaeltachta are elected.

Quarters of Rome

The Quarters of Rome (Italian: "quartieri di Roma") are the areas in and around the Italian city of Rome which became urbanised after the foundation of the last city-centre rione, Prati.
They form the second level of administrative sub-divisions of Roma Capitale. Together they cover 171.38 km2 and hold 1483913 inhabitants.
History.
The first 15 quarters were officially founded and numbered in 1926, after first being drafted in 1911.
As of 1930 there were two more unofficial quarters: the quarter XVI, which was called Città Giardino Aniene in 1924; and the quarter XVII, that was named Savoia in 1926. These two were later officially renamed, the XVII becoming "Trieste" in 1946 and the XVI becoming "Monte Sacro" in 1951. Other quarters have been renamed: the quarter XV, previously called Milvio, became "Della Vittoria" in 1935, while the III, once known as Vittorio Emanuele III in honor of the King of Italy, was renamed "Pinciano" in 1946.
In 1961, 18 more quarters were established and numbered XVIII to XXXV. Some of the new quarters were created dismembering five eastern suburbs of the city, some others were established in the rural area around the city, the so called Agro Romano (the remaining part of the Agro Romano was divided into zones in the same year).

The Hall of Fantasy

The Hall of Fantasy is an American old-time radio dramatic anthology. It was broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System from August 22, 1952, until September 28, 1953.
Format and background.
"The Hall of Fantasy" featured stories with supernatural themes. Radio historian John Dunning wrote in his reference work "Tune in Yesterday:" "The difference between this program and its competitors was that here, man was usually the loser. The supernatural was offered as something respectable, awesome, sometimes devastating and always frightening." 
An early version of the show was developed by Richard Thorne and Carl Greyson and broadcast on KALL in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1949, Thorne revived the program on WGN in Chicago, enhancing the program's appeal with "unusually excellent production values" and sound effects.
Stories adapted for the show included "The Cask of Amontillado", by Edgar Allan Poe, and "Green Tea" by Sheridan Le Fanu. Thorne also wrote original scripts for the program, with the series having about equal numbers of original stories and adaptations.
Personnel.
As an anthology, "The Hall of Fantasy" had no continuing characters. Actors frequently heard in its episodes included Harry Elders, Eloise Kummer, Carl Grayson, and Maurice Copeland. Richard Thorne, who produced and directed, also appeared frequently. Leroy Olliger and Glenn Ransom also directed, and Harold Turner provided the music.

Kin (film)

Kin is a 2018 American science fiction action film directed by Jonathan and Josh Baker and written by Daniel Casey, based on the 2014 short film "Bag Man". The film stars Myles Truitt, Jack Reynor, Zoë Kravitz, Carrie Coon, Dennis Quaid, James Franco, and Michael B. Jordan. The story follows a young boy who finds a strange weapon and his newly paroled brother. The film was released in the United States on August 31, 2018, by Lionsgate and was met with both critical and commercial failure.
Plot.
Fourteen-year-old Elijah "Eli" Solinski lives in Detroit with his stern adoptive father Hal, a widower. While scavenging an abandoned building for copper wiring to sell, Eli discovers the aftermath of a skirmish, with armored corpses and high-tech weaponry strewn about. He picks up a strange weapon, but drops it and flees after it mechanically activates. That evening, Eli's newly paroled older brother Jimmy, Hal's biological son, returns home to Hal's chagrin. Eli dreams of the weapon and sneaks out to retrieve it. Sneaking back in, he overhears Hal and Jimmy arguing. Jimmy owes $60,000 in protection money to Taylor, a local crime lord, and asks Hal to help him steal the money from Hal's employer. Hal refuses and kicks Jimmy out. The next night, Hal catches Jimmy and Taylor breaking into his office's safe. Hal is unwilling to walk away, so Taylor shoots and kills him. Jimmy kills Taylor's brother in the ensuing scuffle and flees with the money. Jimmy convinces Eli that Hal is stuck at a work emergency and wants to meet them at Lake Tahoe. Eli secretly packs the weapon, and they leave moments before Taylor and his gang arrive to ransack the house. Taylor vows to kill Jimmy, as well as Eli to avenge his own brother's death.
The two bond as brothers during the road trip. Jimmy takes Eli into a strip club, where both befriend one of the strippers, Milly. When a drunk Jimmy tries to dance on stage with Milly, the owner, Lee, leads his men to beat Jimmy until Eli brandishes the weapon. Startled, Eli reflexively fires, destroying a pool table. The brothers flee and Milly spontaneously joins them. Two masked, armored figures detect the weapon's use and follow on motorcycles. Jimmy realizes he left the bag of money at the strip club. Milly leads the brothers to Lee's card game, where they retrieve the money from him at gunpoint. The trio get a room in a Nevada casino. Milly discusses her past with Eli throughout the journey; she left her abusive parents as a teen and has failed to establish lasting personal relationships. Hal's murder is reported nationally, which Eli sees. Police identify Eli and Jimmy as suspects and apprehend them. Milly watches from a crowd, and Eli signals his approval that she leave them. Jimmy is jailed and Eli rebukes him.
Taylor and his gang overwhelm the county police station, massacring the officers. Before being executed, a wounded officer helps Eli retrieve the weapon from evidence lockup. Eli kills most of Taylor's men, saving Jimmy. As Eli and Jimmy prepare to surrender to the FBI, Taylor appears and shoots at Jimmy. The two armored pursuers arrive and freeze time for everyone but Eli and themselves. The figures unmask to reveal that they are a man and woman. The man explains that Eli is actually from their world, which is at war. Eli was hidden on this world for his safety until he is old enough to help. The man tells Eli to stay with his brother and calls Eli his own brother. The woman redirects Taylor's bullet and the two leave with the weapon. Time resumes and Taylor is killed by his own bullet. The brothers are taken into custody. Agent Morgan Hunter tells Eli that Jimmy will go to prison, but maybe not for very long if he is cooperative. She tacitly accepts that Jimmy has covered for Eli, who will not discuss the weapon. Milly arrives and waves at Eli.
Production.
On August 30, 2016, it was reported that Myles Truitt, Jack Reynor, James Franco, Zoë Kravitz and Dennis Quaid would star in the feature film.
In September 2016, Lionsgate bought the rights to "Kin" for about $30 million at the Toronto Film Festival. Filming began on October 24, 2016 in Toronto.
Music.
Mogwai composed the score for the film. The soundtrack was released on August 31 by Temporary Residence Limited in the United States and Rock Action Records in the United Kingdom and Europe. Two tracks, "Donuts" and "We're Not Done (End Title)", were released ahead of the album.
Release.
The film was released in the United States by Lionsgate on August 31, 2018.
Box office.
"Kin" grossed $5.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $4.6 million in other territories, for a total worldwide gross of $10.3 million.
In the United States and Canada, "Kin" was projected to gross $5–7 million from 2,141 theaters in its four-day opening weekend. It ended up debuting to just $3.1 million, including a four-day Labor Day weekend total of $3.9 million, and finished 11th at the box office. The film dropped 73.5% in its second weekend to $804,401, one of the largest sophomore declines ever, and finished in 17th place.
Critical response.
On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33%, based on 90 reviews, with an average rating of 4.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Part family drama, part sci-fi adventure, "Kin" struggles to balance its narrative until a late twist that suggests it all might have worked better as the first episode of a TV series." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a 63% overall positive score.

Thomas Edwards (TJAG)

Thomas Edwards (August 1, 1753 – 1806) was the third Judge Advocate General of the United States Army.
Colonel Thomas Edwards was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on 1 August 1753, the son of John and Abigail Edwards. In 1760 he entered Boston Latin School and upon his graduation therefrom entered Harvard College in 1771. Subsequent to his graduation from Harvard College he read law in the office of John Williams of Boston, then a leading practitioner in Massachusetts. He was later admitted to practice in Boston. An ardent patriot, Edwards soon joined the cause of the revolution and on 31 May 1776 was commissioned a lieutenant in the 16th Massachusetts Infantry. The 16th Massachusetts Infantry was considered to be one of the finest regiments of the Continental Army. During hostilities Colonel Edwards took part in the Battles of Monmouth and Springfield, New Jersey, and Quaker Hill, Rhode Island. 
When Colonel John Lawrence resigned his position as Judge Advocate General of the Army at the close of the War of Independence, no successor was immediately found for him. On July 9, 1782, Congress elected James Innis of Virginia to the position, but Innis declined it. On July 11, 1782, Congress increased the pay of the Judge Advocate General, fixing it at $75.00 per month, and adding $12.66 per month for subsistence, and an additional $6.66 per month for a servant to whom would also be allowed rations and clothing equivalent to a private in the Army. Besides all this, a two horse wagon and forage for two saddle horses were permitted. On October 2, 1782, Congress elected Lieutenant Thomas Edwards, then of the 9th Massachusetts Infantry, as Judge Advocate General of the Army, with the rank of colonel.
According to a history of the role published by the Office of the Judge Advocate General, Edwards "gained notoriety in 1783 as a victim of the accepted and rather unsubtle command influence of the day". He served in the trial of a Major Reid, who was charged with disobedience and "unmilitary conduct" towards Moses Hazen. When Reid was acquitted, Hazen accused Edwards of "neglect, incompetence,and partiality toward the accused". Edwards was cleared by an officers' court convened by George Washington.
Colonel Edwards retained his position as Judge Advocate General of the Army until November 3, 1783, when he resigned his position and returned to the practice of law in Boston. In June 1784 the remnants of the Continental Army were disbanded and the permanent standing Army limited to 80 enlisted men and their officers. This tiny force was expanded somewhat in succeeding years but no successor to Colonel Edwards wag appointed prior to the adoption of the Constitution of the United States. Following his return to civilian life, Colonel Edwards held various municipal offices in the city of Boston. According to "The Memorials of the Massachusetts Society of the Cincinnati" (1931), he was "a useful and exemplary citizen and a man of sterling integrity of character... He served as Secretary of the famous Society of the Cincinnati from 1786 until his death in 1806. He had seven children from two marriages.

SEC community service team

Each year, the Southeastern Conference (SEC), a college athletic conference whose member institutions are located primarily in the Southern part of the United States, chooses Community Service Teams of players of various sports from among its member universities. The honor goes to players in recognition of their off-the-court/off-the-field volunteering and community service activities. The Community Service Team is meant to highlight an athlete from each SEC school in a variety of sports. The SEC began this concept with a football Community Service Team in 1994, originally called the Good Works team. The recognition has expanded to other sports over the years. Like an all-conference team or an all-American team, the Community Service Team is a hypothetical team - the members won't actually get together and play a game.
The community service and volunteering the players engage in includes volunteering in schools and for local nonprofits and communities of faith, as well as in youth-focused programs at their respective universities.

Colossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye

The colossal statue of Amenhotep III and Tiye is a monolith group statue of Egyptian pharaoh Amenhotep III of the eighteenth dynasty, his Great Royal Wife Tiye, and three of their daughters. It is the largest known dyad ever carved. The statue originally stood in Medinet Habu, Western Thebes; today it is the centerpiece of the main hall of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.
Description.
The statue is made of limestone, its width is 4,4 m, its height is 7 m. The almond shaped eyes and curved eyebrows of the figures are of typical late 18th dynasty style. Amenhotep III wears the "nemes" headdress with uraeus, a false beard and a kilt; he is resting his hands on his knees. Queen Tiye is sitting on his left, her right arm is placed around her husband's waist. Her height is equal to that of the pharaoh, which shows her prominent status. She wears an ankle-length, close-fitting dress and a heavy wig with a vulture headdress, modius and double uraei. The cobras and the vulture are crowned, the proper right cobra wears the white crown of Upper Egypt, while the proper left one wears the red crown of Lower Egypt.
The three smaller figures depict three of their daughters. Princess Henuttaneb, standing between her parents, is depicted as a grown woman, in a close-fitting dress and a full wig with modius and plumes but without uraei (this is the only difference between her mother's headdress and hers). Next to Amenhotep stands the damaged figure of a younger daughter, Nebetah, while next to Tiye stands the even more damaged figure of another princess, whose name has been lost. The dyad is one of only two statues depicting Henuttaneb, and the only one of Nebetah.
The statue is likely to have been carved around the first sed festival of Amenhotep III. Arielle Kozloff writes that the age of the daughters depicted on the monument, especially that of Henuttaneb, and the style of Queen Tiye's wig, which was "at its most developed, nearly shrouding her face" suggests that the statue was made during the third decade of the king's reign. It is possible that it was made from the good quality limestone which was removed to create the open courtyard of TT192 – a huge tomb belonging to Queen Tiye's steward Kheruef, work on which was started around this time.
The eldest daughter of the royal couple, Sitamun is absent from the statue group, probably because she was elevated to the rank of great royal wife by Year 30 of Amenhotep's reign. Henuttaneb was the second or third daughter, born either before or after Iset, who became queen in Year 34. Henuttaneb is nowhere mentioned as a queen, but on this colossus she is described as "the companion of Horus, who is in his heart". This is the only instance of this queenly title being given to a princess, and her name is sometimes written in a cartouche, which may indicate that she was elevated to queen like Sitamun and Iset. The third princess on the statue, whose name is destroyed is sometimes tentatively identified as Iset, but Amenhotep may have had as many as sixteen daughters, not all of whom are known to us.
History.
The statue belonged to the mortuary temple of Amenhotep III, which has been mostly destroyed since, but during its time was the largest temple complex in Thebes, surpassing even the Karnak temple. As it was built too close to the floodplain, less than two hundred years later it already stood in ruins and most of its stones were reused by later pharaohs for their own building projects. The place where the statue was found is likely to have been the south gate of the mortuary temple complex, as it is as far from the temple as the Colossi of Memnon at the east gate. Another possibility is that the dyad was usurped by Ramesses III when using the blocks from Amenhotep's temple to construct his own at Medinet Habu, although original names were not erased. The statue was found in the late 19th century in fragments. In 1897 the fragments were moved by Georges Daressy to the forecourt of the small Amun temple at Medinet Habu nearby; later they were moved to Cairo and reassembled for the opening of the Egyptian Museum in 1902. The colossus has the catalogue number M610; the figure of Princess Henuttaneb has a separate number, JE 33906.
A 27,6 cm limestone head, found in a private collection, turned out to be the head of Princess Nebetah and a part of this statue. Nebetah wears a round wig and a modius headdress; traces of the sidelock of youth can still be discovered. She has the same almond-shaped eyes with finely carved eyebrows and cosmetic lines as the other figures of the group. The head is likely to have been intentionally removed from the statue group, probably in the medieval period, exposed on the ground for quite a long time – as it is in a worse condition than the rest of the statue –, and was found before 1897 when the rest of the statue was moved from its place. It belonged to a French private collection in the early 20th century, was exhibited as part of the W. Arnold Meijer Collection in Amsterdam in 2005-2006 and was sold for US$206,500 in 2008. An exact copy of the head was attached to the statue in Cairo.
In 2011, several new fragments of the statue were found during a rescue excavation before installation of a new sewage system on the west bank of Luxor. These could be reconstructed to form six missing parts of the statue, including part of headdress, chest and right leg of the king, part of wig, left arm, palm, fingers and leg of the queen, and part of the statue base, with a Nubian prisoner. Due to the fragments not having any inscriptions on them, they were initially difficult to date, but Amenhotep III was the only Eighteenth dynasty pharaoh who had colossal statues of this size and they were found only in his mortuary temple and at Medinet Habu; this helped to match the pieces to the colossus in the Cairo museum. With the newly found parts added the statue is 70% complete.

Opinion polling for the 2007 French presidential election

This page lists public opinion polls conducted for the 2007 French presidential election, which was held on 22 April 2007 with a run-off on 6 May 2007.
Unless otherwise noted, all polls listed below are compliant with the regulations of the national polling commission ("Commission nationale des sondages") and utilize the quota method.
First round.
During the 2007 presidential election, Ipsos launched the first ever rolling poll in France, described as a "continuous electoral barometer", publishing results every day of the week except Sunday for ten weeks starting on 1 March 2007. The Ifop poll conducted from 23 to 26 February 2007, marked with an asterisk (*) below, was conducted specifically for subsample data.
The publication of first-round polls was prohibited after midnight on 20 April 2007. The TNS Sofres poll conducted from 20 to 21 April was an internal survey which was not distributed during the electoral silence.
Graphical summary.
The averages in the graphs below were constructed using polls listed below conducted by the six major French pollsters. The graphs are smoothed 14-day weighted moving averages, using only the most recent poll conducted by any given pollster within that range (each poll weighted based on recency).
On 6 November 2006, Jean-Pierre Chevènement announced his candidacy in the presidential election, before withdrawing just a month later on 10 December 2006 after concluding an agreement with the Socialist Party (PS) for an alliance in the subsequent legislative elections. On 7 November, Nicolas Hulot launched an appeal to candidates to commit to an "Ecological Pact", but affirmed that he would on 22 January 2007 that he would not stand as a candidate in the election. In an interview published on 28 December 2006, Michèle Alliot-Marie evoked the possibility of a candidacy without the support of her party, having recently founded the think tank "Le Chêne"; however, she ultimately announced her support for Nicolas Sarkozy on 12 January 2007. In an interview published on 11 March, Corinne Lepage announced that she would back François Bayrou despite having "the capacity" to obtain the 500 sponsorships necessary to be a candidate. In an interview published on 17 March, Nicolas Dupont-Aignan announced that he had failed to gather enough sponsorships to stand in the election. Jacques Chirac announced on 11 March that he would not seek a third term, before finally backing the candidacy of Sarkozy on 21 March.
Because the TNS Sofres poll conducted from 20 to 21 April was not published during the electoral silence, it is not included in the average below.
Second round.
During the 2007 presidential election, Ipsos launched the first ever rolling poll in France, described as a "continuous electoral barometer", publishing results every day of the week except Sunday for ten weeks starting on 1 March 2007. The Ifop poll conducted from 23 to 26 February 2007, marked with an asterisk (*) below, was conducted specifically for subsample data.
The publication of second-round polls was prohibited after midnight on 4 May 2007.
Graphical summary.
The averages in the graphs below were constructed using polls listed below conducted by the six major French pollsters. The graphs are 14-day weighted moving averages, using only the most recent poll conducted by any given pollster within that range (each poll weighted based on recency).
Royal–Sarkozy.
By department.
The BVA poll was conducted for "La Dépêche du Midi" in the 10 departments where the newspaper is circulated, of which eight are in the Midi-Pyrénées region (Ariège, Aveyron, Haute-Garonne, Gers, Lot, Hautes-Pyrénées, Tarn, and Tarn-et-Garonne), as well as Aude and Lot-et-Garonne.

Líonraí Gaeilge is the Irish language term for "Irish Language Networks". The Gaeltacht Act 2012 (Republic of Ireland) allowed for the formal designation by Foras na Gaeilge and the Irish Department of Media, Tourism, Arts, Culture, Sport and the Gaeltacht of certain areas as "Líonraí Gaeilge" or "Irish Language Networks", outside the traditional Irish-speaking areas collectively known as the "Gaeltacht". This would be done where the Irish language seemed strong enough to justify it. 
In February 2018, Foras na Gaeilge announced that five areas - Belfast, Loughrea, Carn Tóchair, Ennis and the Dublin suburb of Clondalkin - were to be designated as the first Líonraí Gaeilge, subject to the committees in the networks co-formulating and adopting approved Irish language plans. Foras na Gaeilge have said that they expect to also designate other areas outside the Gaeltacht as Líonraí Gaeilge.

Express company

An express company is a business developed in the United States which provides for the speedy transmission of parcels or merchandise of any kind and their safe delivery in good condition. “Collect on delivery” service is also featured, the express company making the collecting and forwarding “returns” to the shipper. Money orders also are issued, payable at any of the numerous offices throughout the United States.
History.
Express service had its beginnings in the trip made from Boston to New York by William F. Harnden (1813-45), the first “express-package carrier,” on March 4, 1839. The plan recommending itself to business men, competing companies sprang up rapidly, and express lines were established in all directions. Adams &amp; Company's California express was started in 1849; Wells, Fargo &amp; Company's in 1852; the American-European Company in 1855. As railroads extended, the early “pony express” disappeared, and individual companies made contracts with the railroad companies, their business over these routes being held to be entitled to the protection of the courts against any efforts to dispossess them. Many of the rival companies united, and now are joint-stock institutions, employing capital amounting to over $50,000,000.

Borgward Group

Borgward Group AG is a German-based automobile brand established in May, 2008 with headquarter in Stuttgart, Germany. The company carries the name and logo of the former German brand Borgward. Design and engineering is located in Germany, but the cars are produced in China by Foton Motor.
Borgward started its business with a fleet of conventional SUVs with sales reaching approx. 75,000 units by January 2018 and has branches in China, Russia, India, Brazil and Mexico. However, the company aspires to become one of the leading electric vehicle manufacturers in the next decade. Full electric models, BXi7 and GT SUV BX6 were officially launched on May 9, 2018, in Beijing, China, and at the Frankfurt Motor Show 2017 presented the Isabella concept, its vision of a full-electric 4-door coupé. 
History.
Christian Borgward revived the Borgward trademark, with the help of the Chinese truck manufacturer Foton, who sold a stake in the company to the Chinese car rental group Ucar in 2019. Borgward Group AG is responsible for the development, production, sales and marketing of Borgward cars.
Genesis.
On April 2005, Christian Borgward (grandson of Carl F. W. Borgward) as president and Karlheinz L. Knöss as CEO and vice president of the supervisory board started the revival of Borgward. They started the development of the new Borgward automobiles with Roland Sternmann (Designer) and Benjamin Nawka (Designer), set up the organisation and engineer team and developed several car concepts. On May 21, 2008, Borgward and Knöss founded Borgward Group AG in Lucerne (Switzerland), later relocating to Stuttgart (Germany).
Foton earned the rights to maintain the Borgward name in 2014.
Troubles.
According to the German newspaper "Automobilwoche", the company struggled to earn better sales after Foton sold its 67% stake to UCar in 2019 for $614 million. The newspaper said that Borgward sold around 5,000 vehicles in the first half of 2020. According to André Lacerda, a Borgward salesman in Luxembourg, the company does not have plans to halt reintroduction of Borgward vehicles throughout Europe. 
Charles Zhengyao Lu, chairman of Luckin Coffee, was also involved in an accounting scandal, which played a role in the sudden sales decline.
Borgward has reportedly vacated its headquarters in Stuttgart as of 2020 with calls to the office going unanswered.
Overseas Presence.
At the 14th Internation Motor Show in Dubai on November 14, 2017, the Borgward BX5 and 7 are being marketed to GCC countries.
The brand is distributed in Malaysia by Go Bremen Motors, which was announced on May 2, 2018. An agreement signed between GBM and Borgward will also see manufacturing of vehicles and exports to some parts of ASEAN. However, plans to launch the brand in Malaysia in 2019 were stalled and suggestions were made that it would be launched by first quarter 2020. On July 7, 2018, the Luxembourgish company AUTODIS ESCH/MERSCH was appointed as the first European retailer/distributor for Borgward.
In April 2020, it was announced that DSM Global Company is in partnership with GBM to handle car exports to Nepal with the former handling Nepali operations.
Borgward announced that the company will retail its vehicles to Britain and Ireland in 2019 with models distributed by International Motors.
Production.
Foton is currently Borgward's sole investor, but both companies have repeatedly announced that the ownership structure may change over time.
Borgward announced plans for a new car at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show after a 54-year hiatus. The new company is backed up financially by Chinese truck manufacturer Foton.
The Borgward BX7 SUV was introduced at the IAA, Frankfurt in September 2015. and sales in China started in July 2016.
Sales.
According to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAMP), BG has reportedly sold around 30,000 BX7s in 2017.

Sport climbing at the Summer Olympics

Sport climbing made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The Olympics was originally scheduled to be held in 2020, but was postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic. It is governed by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC).
Bid for inclusion.
The inclusion was proposed by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) in 2015. In September 2015, sport climbing was included in a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, surfing, and karate to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics; and in June 2016, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games. Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program.
Competition format.
At the 2020 Summer Olympics, two sport climbing events were contested: men's combined and women's combined. The competition format combined three disciplines of sport climbing: speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing. This decision caused widespread criticism in the climbing community.
Members of the IFSC explained that they were only granted one gold medal per gender by the Olympic committee and they did not want to exclude speed climbing. The IFSC's goal for the 2020 Olympics was primarily to establish climbing and its three disciplines as Olympic sports; changes to the format could follow later. This tactic proved to be successful as they were granted a second set of medals for the 2024 Summer Olympics, where speed climbing will be a separate event from the combined event of lead climbing and bouldering.
Participating nations.
The following nations have taken part in the sport climbing competition. The numbers in the table indicate the number of competitors sent to that year's Olympics.

Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Lviv

The Adam Mickiewicz Monument, also known as the Adam Mickiewicz Column, (Polish: "Kolumna Adama Mickiewicza we Lwowie", Ukrainian: "Пам'ятник Адамові Міцкевичу"), is a Neo-classical column commemorating the Polish Romantic poet Adam Mickiewicz (1798–1855) located at the Mickiewicz Square in the centre of Lviv, Ukraine, and opened in 1904.
History.
In 1897, a committee headed by Władysław Łoziński and devoted to the construction of a monument in Lviv, Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, dedicated to Romantic-era poet Adam Mickiewicz was established. In 1898, a contest to design it was launched and, out of 28 projects, the jury selected the one designed by Polish sculptor Antoni Popiel. On the initiative of Adam Krechowiecki, it was agreed that the monument should take the form of a column. The monument was built between 1902-1904 and was officially unveiled on 30 October, 1904. It features the national poet of Poland Adam Mickiewicz at the foot of the column above whom there is a sculpture of a winged Genius of Poetry handing a lyre to the poet. A large candle light is located at the top of the 21-metre tall column.
The monument was erected at the Mariacki Square (currently Mickiewicz Square) near the figure of Virgin Mary. The granite shaft of the column was transported from the Kingdom of Italy while the bronze elements were cast in Teodor Serpek's factory in Vienna. The figure of Adam Mickiewicz is 3.3 metres (10.8 ft) tall and the flame atop the candle light is gilded. The monument emerged completely unscathed after the Second World War. 
The column is one of the Polish national monuments which remained in Lviv after the war, unlike the John III Sobieski Monument or Aleksander Fredro Monument, which were transferred to Gdańsk and Wrocław respectively, based on an additional protocol to the 1944 agreement between the Polish Committee of National Liberation ("Polski Komitet Wyzwolenia Narodowego", PKWN) and the Ukrainian SSR signed in Kyiv (1945), which allowed to hand over to the Polish government the national monuments in Lviv connected to Polish culture and history with the exception of the Adam Mickiewicz Monument which "enjoys great popularity and is loved by the Ukrainian nation".

The Terminator Collectible Card Game

The Terminator Collectible Card Game is an out-of-print collectible card game by Precedence based on the movie of the same name from 1984. It was released in October 2000. The first and only set had 349 cards, although others claim 348 for a missing "Extrapolate" card. The game was cancelled one year before Precedence closed as a company.
The game closely resembles Aliens vs. Predator Collectible Card Game and is compatible. The game was said to have a role-playing feel as characters search for equipment, look for chances to attack, and comb the streets for characters important to the future. Gameplay involves one player assuming the role of Skynet trying to eliminate the other player who plays as the human Resistance. Players take turns by playing Location cards where they play Character cards. A player may win in one of three ways: eliminating all of your opponent's main characters, fulfill 10 Mission Points from Mission cards, or safeguard/eliminate 10 Importance points worth of supporting characters.
The game was criticized because in tournaments players would have to maintain two decks, one for Skynet and one for the Resistance.

Puppy (band)

Puppy is an English rock band from London, England, formed in 2014. The band's current lineup consists of vocalist/guitarist Jock Norton, bass guitarist Will Michael and drummer Billy Howard Price. They are currently signed to Rude Records. Puppy have performed at several music festivals held in the UK over the last few years, including Glastonbury Festival, Download Festival, Bloodstock, Slam Dunk Festival and 2000 Trees Festival.
History.
2014–2015: Formation and early years.
Following the demise of the band Polterghost, Norton and Price formed Puppy in late 2014 with bass player Matthew Rickelton. In 2015, Puppy debuted their first single "Forever", subsequently followed by "The Great Beyond". Both songs appeared as playable tracks on Guitar Hero Live. Following a string of dates throughout the year supporting the likes of Demob Happy, Pity Sex and Kagoule as well as a performance at the Reeperbahn Festival in Hamburg, Germany in September, Puppy released their self-titled debut EP in 2015.
2016–2017: "Vol II".
Will Michael replaced Matthew Rickelton on bass duties shortly after the release of their debut EP. On 10 April 2016, Daniel P. Carter played Puppy's single "Entombed" on the BBC Radio 1 Rock Show for the first time.
In May 2016, Puppy announced, via their Facebook page, that they would be releasing a new EP later that year, which would include "Entombed". After an appearance at that year's Download Festival, they released their second EP, entitled Vol II, on 12 August 2016. In October 2016, the band toured with Sorority Noise across the UK.
The band signed to Spinefarm Records in March 2017 and embarked on a short European tour supporting Creeper and Milk Teeth. In April that year, Puppy were nominated for "Best New Band" at The 2017 Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards. Dates supporting CKY in May and Kvelertak in October preceded a small headline tour throughout the UK in late 2017. The band re-released Vol II on 29 September 2017 via Spinefarm Records.
2017–2020: "The Goat" and "iii".
A new single, entitled "Demons" was released in October 2017, accompanied by a music video. From March to April 2018, Puppy toured with Bristol based alt-rockers Turbowolf throughout Europe. On 1 June 2018, via their Facebook page, Puppy announced a "World Tour" with UK Hardcore band Grove Street Families, which consisted of nine dates across the UK in September 2018. Puppy performed a set at Download Festival again in June 2018 and spent the rest of 2018 working on their full length debut album with Royal Blood, Ghost and Pixies producer Tom Dalgety, and Creeper and Boston Manor producer Neil Kennedy. On 17 August 2018, the band announced that they would be the opening act for notorious American nu metal band King 810's headline tour of the UK in December 2018.&lt;ref name="NEWS: King 810 announce UK tour for November/December 2018!"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, Puppy ultimately pulled out of the tour on 5 December, due to an "ongoing health issue" that "made travel and performance too difficult".
On Sunday 26 August 2018, Daniel P Carter played Puppy's new single, "Black Hole" on Radio One. Carter and Puppy also announced that Puppy's debut album, entitled "The Goat", would be released on 25 January 2019 through Spinefarm Records. The following day, a music video for "Black Hole" was premiered on Revolver Magazine's website. On 13 November 2018, Puppy released the 2nd single from The Goat, entitled "World Stands Still".&lt;ref name="PUPPY RELEASE NEW SINGLE/ VIDEO “WORLD STANDS STILL” FROM DEBUT ALBUM, THE GOAT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 2018, Marc Burrows featured Puppy in The Guardian's "One To Watch" column, describing the band as having "a knack for hitting hard – as on recent single Black Hole – in a way that is headbangingly (sic) authentic and, whisper it, commercially appealing.", adding "Puppy are that rare thing: a homegrown metal band capable of capturing the mainstream".
During a European tour supporting Monster Magnet in January 2019, Puppy's debut album, "The Goat", was released. Metal Hammer gave the album 4 stars out of 5, stating; "For a debut album this is a mightily impressive and quirky little record". NME stated that "The Goat" "contains more hooks than a pirate convention". Bristol in Stereo said that the album is "a refreshing take on metal with a tongue-in-cheek attitude". "Loudwire" named it one of the 50 best rock albums of 2019.
Puppy performed at 2019's Reading and Leeds Festivals, and were nominated in the "Best UK Breakthrough Band" category at the 2019 Heavy Music Awards. In September 2019, Puppy announced a co-headline tour throughout Europe and the UK with Norwegian Stoner Rock band Bokassa. The tour lasted from late November until mid December 2019.
On 25 October, after weeks of cryptic messages posted on the band's social media channels, Puppy dropped their 3rd extended play, entitled "iii". The EP was recorded over the summer of 2019 at Holy Mountain Studios in London. This recording featured a more stripped down production than on "The Goat", as the band "recorded quickly and essentially live to capture chemistry, spirit (and) a more frayed and brutal set of sonics."
They also announced a release show for the EP, which took place in Hackney on 31 October, where they played "iii" in its entirety.
On 18 November, it was confirmed that Puppy were due to return to play at Download Festival in 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the festival was cancelled. Puppy released a music video, via their official YouTube channel, for the song "Powder Blue" on 17 April. On 21 July, the band released a music video for 'fan favourite' track, "Serotonin", containing various visual stimuli, which, according to drummer Billy Price, intentionally displays "so many textual and visual interpretations of the song that it becomes almost uninterpretable", adding "We have never been more easily interconnected, and yet communication has never felt this hard. In a sense, this is what the song ‘Serotonin’ is about".
2021-Present: "Rude Records".
On the 3rd June 2021, Puppy, via their Facebook page, announced that they had signed to Rude Records. From the 7th to the 9th June, the band played three socially distanced shows at Walthamstow's Signature Brewery, debuting new material. On July 5th, Puppy released their first single for Rude Records, "Angel", with an accompanying music video.
Musical Style.
Puppy's music has been categorised by critics as heavy metal, occult rock and alternative metal. They are described by Spinefarm Records as combining "the left-field melodic turns of Weezer, the hazy fuzz of Smashing Pumpkins and the straight-to-the bone sonics of the Big Four of Thrash". The band themselves have stated that their goal, musically, "was to aim for somewhere between Teenage Fanclub and Black Sabbath". Additionally, Metal Hammer has compared the band's musical style to "Ghost waltzing with Deftones", "Mixing flashy, glam rock guitar flourishes that turn into huge hulking metal riffs with the kind of chin-stroking, elegant indie pop that Weezer have made a career from". Revolver Magazine characterised their debut album, The Goat, as "a frothy, fist-raising cocktail blending various chunks of Black Sabbath, AC/DC, Metallica, Soundgarden, Nirvana, Meat Puppets and Dinosaur Jr., topped with infectious choruses and infused with heavenly harmonies."

Asparasphenodon arapapa, also known as the Bahia's broad-snout casque-headed tree frog, is a species of frog endemic to the Atlantic Rainforest of Southern Bahia, Brazil. The frogs of the genus "Asparasphenodon" are distinguished by a bony plate on top of their heads, referred to as "casqueheaded". Casqueheaded frogs are characterized by their phragmotic behavior. "A. arapapa" is further characterized by the long bill-shaped "snout" they possess, similar to that of "Triprion petasatus", a head longer than it is wide, and their small size (male snout-vent length 57.4–58.1 mm). This species, and all species of "Asparasphenodon", use their unique head shape to seal off the leaves of bromeliads, the plant they inhabit solely. This has two known purposes: warding off predators from the frog as well as their young (the male performs this action), and trapping moisture.

Family Peace Association

The Family Peace Association was officially inaugurated on December 2, 2017 in Seoul, South Korea where it announced its mission: “To enlighten humanity by uplifting their spiritual consciousness through universal principles and values rooted in God-centered families.” It is still in its formative stages of development.
The co-founders of the Family Peace Association are Hyun Jin Moon and Junsook Moon. Jinman Kwak is the current president.
In his address at the Inaugural Ceremony, Hyun Jin Moon expressed that the Family Peace Association was created to carry on the trans-religious work his late father, Sun Myung Moon, sought to accomplish with the establishment of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification (FFWPU). Hyun Jin Moon held a key leadership role in FFWPU from 1998 to 2008. He stated, "I can no longer work through the FFWPU because it is not true to my father’s original mission", and dedicated the Family Peace Association as the "new vehicle" to realize his father's intentions of "creating a global movement to inspire all humanity to establish God-centered families."
It was suggested that the Family Peace Association could play a leadership role in the reunification of the Korean peninsula through a focus on reuniting families divided between North and South.
Relation to the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification and Sun Myung Moon.
The Family Federation for World Peace and Unification was established in the mid-1990s by Sun Myung Moon. Sun Myung Moon stated at the founding of the FFWPU that he never intended to create a new religion, but to open an age after religion where families would serve as the core of spiritual and character growth. Sun Myung Moon has even stated that the HSA-UWC, the predecessor to FFWPU which he established in 1954, was meant to foster ecumenical cooperation among Christian sects to promote families with deep spirituality and a commitment to serving their larger society.
In 1994, Rev. Moon declared the completion of the mission of HSA-UWC aiming to dissolve the church structure, and two years later the FFWPU was launched as a new entity to advance Unification theology and principles. The FFWPU was created as a broad-based social movement to promote healthy families and strong societies. According to a memo from the HSA-UWC North America Headquarters in 1997, from the beginning it was clear that the two entities, FFWPU and HSA-UWC, were separate entities, both in objectives and legally. 
Hyun Jin Moon was appointed vice-president of the Family Federation for World Peace and Unification in 1998. Hyun Jin Moon is the successor leading the Unification Movement.

Trustico

Trustico is a dedicated SSL Certificate Provider, whose headquarters are in the United Kingdom.
History.
The company was founded in 2006 in United Kingdom by Zane Lucas. They gradually spread around the world over the following years. The firm currently operates entirely in the selling of SSL Certificates.
On 22 June 2017 Trustico entered a Partnership with Comodo, a developer of cyber security solutions and digital certificates.
The company became notable in March 2018, after its CEO transferred the private keys for 23,000 HTTPS certificates via email (a non-secure protocol) to an executive at DigiCert. The fact that these private keys had been stored by Trustico suggested that Trustico had been violating the baseline requirements for certificate authorities.
This was followed by the disclosure of a critical security flaw – a publicly accessible root shell – in the Trustico website, after which the website was taken offline. The result was that thousands of Trustico customers had their security certificates revoked by DigiCert.
Controversies.
Symantec abandonment, 2018.
Following Google's statement, on 11 September 2017, to distrust Symantec's SSL Certificates for unsatisfactory security standards. Trustico followed suit in abandoning Symantec issued SSL Certificates. Trustico offered replacements to all Symantec CA Certificates issued between June 2016 and December 2017 in compensation for those affected by the abandonment.
DigiCert and Trustico spat, 2018.
On 2 February Trustico sent an email to DigiCert requesting the revocation of all Symantec Certificates - around 50,000 - managed by DigiCert. DigiCert, who had recently acquired Symantec's CA business denies the request to mass-revoke the certificates. On 25 February DigiCert terminated its contract with Trustico after Trustico said it would seek a legal opinion on the matter.
On 27 February DigiCert released a statement claiming they had received an email from Trustico containing over 23,000 private keys before mass emailing Trustico's customers about the security breach.

Grammaire égyptienne

 (literally: 'Egyptian Grammar') is a grammar reference book by the French Egyptologist Jean-François Champollion, published posthumously in France in 1836. Its full title, the Grammaire égyptienne ou Principes généraux de l'écriture sacrée égyptienne appliqué à la présentation de la langue parlée means "Egyptian Grammar or General Principles of Egyptian Sacred Writing Applied to the Presentation of the Spoken Language".
Origins.
Upon his return from Egypt to France on 5 March 1830, after almost twenty months of absence, Champollion immediately gave priority to the clarification of his "Grammaire". Like the record cards of or the plates of , the "Grammaire" contains numerous records and drawings reproduced in Egypt, by Champollion himself and his assistants; but he died in 1832 without being able to publish it. It was his brother, Jacques-Joseph Champollion, who would handle its publication in 1836. Marcellin Jobard, a lithographer from Brussels, whom claimed to have advised Champollion the use of lithography for the printing of the "Grammaire égyptienne". The printing combines lithography and typography, with lithographic stone transfer methods improved by Jules Feuquières, used by 's lithographic workshop in Paris, which was responsible for the lithographic printing process of the "Grammaire".
"Grammaire" points out that the Egyptian hieroglyphs are a complex system, writing figurative, symbolic, and phonetic all at once. This work went hand in hand with the "Dictionnaire égyptien en écriture hiéroglyphique", another work by Champollion which was also published posthumously by his brother in 1841. The aim of "Dictionnaire égyptien" was to create a complete method of learning hieroglyphic writing. Émile Prisse d'Avennes, a French engineer, who became Egyptologist after studying "Grammaire égyptienne".
Hieroglyphics.
"Grammaire égyptienne" contains many hieroglyphs in a rather particular style.

3rd Missouri Cavalry Regiment (Confederate)

The 3rd Missouri Cavalry Regiment was a cavalry regiment of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. It was also known as Greene's Regiment after its commander, Colonel Colton Greene.
History.
Recruiting and Organization.
The unit that became the 3rd Missouri Cavalry began recruiting after Brigadier General Martin E. Green requested division commander Major General Sterling Price to authorize Colonel Colton Greene and Lieutenant Colonel Leonidas C. Campbell to raise a regiment of partisan rangers in the Trans-Mississippi Department on 3 June 1862. In the late northern hemisphere summer of that year, Greene and Campbell began recruiting cavalry companies in southern Missouri, the former under the authority of the Confederate Secretary of War. The 3rd Missouri Cavalry was mustered into service as a regular cavalry unit at Pocahontas, Arkansas, on 4 November. 
Company A was composed of men from Christian, Greene, and Webster Counties, Company B of men from Cape Girardeau, Iron, Madison, and St. Francois Counties, Company C of men from Reynolds, St. Francois, and Washington Counties, Company D of men from Webster and Wright Counties, Company E of men from Camden, Greene, and Pulaski Counties, Company F of men from Dent and Phelps Counties, Company G of men from Cedar and Webster Counties, Company H of men from Greene and Taney Counties, Company I of men from Dade, McDonald, and Newton Counties, and Company K of men from Ozark and Laclede Counties. Greene, Campbell, and Leonidas A. Campbell were appointed Colonel, Lieutenant Colonel, and Major, respectively, by the Confederate authorities, despite an unsuccessful attempt to elect field officers by the company officers.
1862–1863.
Elements of the regiment saw their baptism of fire on 7 November when they joined Colonel John Q. Burbridge's Missouri cavalry brigade in an assault on a Union outpost near Clark's Mill in Douglas County. The 150 outnumbered Union troops surrendered after a brief action, and the brigade destroyed the outpost. On 24 November the brigade attacked a Union supply train in Wright County, killing and wounding 28 Union soldiers, capturing 45, and burning the 40 wagons of the train. In early December, the 3rd, 4th, and 8th Missouri Cavalry were subordinated to Colonel Moses J. White's brigade, newly organized at Pocahontas. On 28 December, near Van Buren, a detachment from the regiment participated in the capture of a Union forage party.
Colonel Joseph C. Porter took command of the brigade by early January 1863, when it participated in Brigadier General John S. Marmaduke's first raid into southwest Missouri, with a detachment from the 3rd Missouri Cavalry under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Campbell. During the Battle of Hartville on 11 January, the brigade was ambushed; the regiment lost six soldiers killed or mortally wounded and 19 other wounded in heavy fighting which ended after the Union troops retreated to Lebanon. Greene took command of the brigade after Porter was mortally wounded at Hartville, leading it in Marmaduke's second raid into southeast Missouri in late April, in which the regiment did not "closely engage" the Union troops. On 4 July it fought in the unsuccessful attack on Helena, suffering casualties of three killed and six wounded.
In the Little Rock campaign from late August to early September, the regiment unsuccessfully attempted to defend the city from a Union attack, suffering light casualties at the Battles of Brownsville, Bayou Meto, and Bayou Fourche. During the 25 October Battle of Pine Bluff, it dismounted and attacked the Pine Bluff Union garrison from the south, but was repulsed after an intense action, suffering casualties of three killed and seven wounded. Shortly afterwards, the 3rd Missouri Cavalry moved into winter quarters in southern Arkansas, where it passed the next several months uneventfully. Lieutenant Colonel Campbell died on 19 November; he was replaced by Major Leonidas A. Campbell, who was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel on 30 December. Company B Captain James Surridge simultaneously replaced Campbell as Major.
1864–1865.
The combat service of the regiment in 1864 began with skirmishing between 31 March and 15 April, attempting to delay the advance of the army of Union Major General Frederick Steele during the Red River Campaign. In his Camden Expedition, Steele attempted to advance from Little Rock to Shreveport, Louisiana. After 15 April the latter shifted his route and took Camden, and on 18 April the regiment fought in the Battle of Poison Spring, in which it participated in the defeat of Union troops and the capture of a large forage train. After Steele retreated from Camden, the regiment, with Marmaduke's Brigade, pursued the Union forces and fought in the Battle of Jenkins' Ferry on 30 April. Alongside the 4th Missouri, the regiment moved into a swamp to scout the Union position, and advanced at sunrise, engaging the Union troops. In rain and fog, both regiments fought in a "spirited" manner for two hours before being relieved by an Arkansas infantry brigade. At Jenkins' Ferry, Steele managed to cross the Saline River and return to Little Rock. In Camden Expedition, the regiment suffered relatively heavy casualties of eight killed and 36 wounded.
During late May and early June, the 3rd Missouri Cavalry harassed Union shipping on the Mississippi River from positions on the west bank in Chicot County, Arkansas, sinking, burning, disabling, or damaging several boats. On 6 June it fought in the Battle of Ditch Bayou, forming part of the main Confederate line and delaying the Union advance over several hours.

Mary Leaf

Mary Leaf (1925–2004) was an Akwesasne Mohawk basket maker, who lived on the border between Canada and the United States. Leaf specialized in basket making, having learned customary basketry techniques from her mother. Her work can be found in the collections of the Newark Museum and the National Museum of the American Indian.
Biography.
Leaf was born in 1925 on the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation that lies on the border between Canada and the United States. Her mother, Josephine Thompson, taught her brown ash basketry weaving and lacrosse stick lacing techniques at a young age. Leaf created baskets that were often primarily aesthetic, including small colourful "fancy" baskets in the shape of strawberries. Other women known for this curl and twist technique of basket making are Florence Benedict, Mary Adams, and Katie Sickles. Although utilitarian basket-making became less common after the 1930s—as the Great Depression ended and Mohawk people began finding more non-agricultural jobs—Leaf became known as a Mohawk basket maker and influenced the resurgence of basket-making in the Northeastern Woodlands in the late 20th century. 
Art career.
Leaf's baskets can be found in collections at the Newark Museum of New Jersey, the North American Indian Traveling College of Ontario, the Iroquois Indian Museum in Howes Cave, NY, and the National Museum of the American Indian. In 2015, the Thunder Bay Art Gallery featured her baskets in an exhibition, "Woven from Wood".
Honours.
In 1983, Leaf was honoured at a special banquet for Akwesasne basket makers hosted in Hogansburg, New York.
Death.
Leaf died in 2004.

List of cement manufacturers in Uganda

This is the list of companies that manufacture cement in Uganda.
Production.
, Uganda cement manufacturers had installed capacity of 6,800,000 tonnes of cement annually, with Tororo Cement Limited being responsible for 3.0 million tonnes (44 percent) and Hima Cement Limited producing 1.9 million tonnes (28 percent). Simba Cement Uganda Limited* produces 1 million tonnes annually (15 percent). The remaining companies are responsible for the remaining 900,000 tonnes (13 percent).
In January 2018, Uganda's consumption was estimated at 2.4 million tonnes annually; 35.3 percent of total annual production, although that percentage is on the rise, given the multitude of major, ongoing infrastructure projects in the county. The remaining output that is not consumed locally is marketed to regional neighboring countries, including Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.

<doc id="56725842" url="?curid=56725842" title="Luisa Cappiani">
Luisa Cappiani

Luisa Kapp-Young (pseudonym, Luisa Cappiani; 23 April 1835 – 27 September 1919), was an Austrian dramatic operatic soprano, musical educator, and essayist who used the principle of the Aeolian harp emission of tone, which excluded all effort in the throat, and preserved the voice.
Kapp-Young made her debut after the death of her husband, Gisbert Kapp, in 1859. In 1861, she sang Wagner roles in Rotterdam. In the United States, she appeared in 1867 as Mme. Kapp-Young. After several seasons in Italy, she came back to the United States, and established herself under the name of Cappiani as a teacher in Boston and New York City. In 1884, she was one of the original founders of the American Federation of Musicians, and the only woman initially elected. After 1899, she lived permanently in Milan, and died in Zurich in 1919.
Early years and education.
Luisa Young was born 23 April 1835, in Trieste. Her paternal grandfather was a noted Scotchman who was a professor in the University of Munich. Her father was a dramatic tenor, at the Hof-Capelle, Munich, and her mother was a German woman of high social rank. Her brother, Frederic Young, was also a dramatic tenor.
At the age of six years, Kapp-Young was a musical prodigy, and she received a thorough musical education.
Her childhood was one of song, but song carefully directed by wise parents. Her musical education was continued at the Vienna Conservatory. In Vienna, her teachers were Josephine Fröhlich and the tenor Passadonna; in Italy, they were San Giovanni, Vanucini, Gamberini, the elder Romani and Francesco Lamperti.
Career.
Singer.
At the age of seventeen, she married Gisbert Kapp, an Austrian counselor. Her husband died three years after their marriage, leaving her with two children, a son, also named Gisbert Kapp and a daughter, and with only a small pension with which to support and educate her family. After a period of mourning, Kapp-Young began to make use of her talents and her training, in order to enough money for her children's education. When she began her musical career, in 1859, she combined her names, Kapp and Young, into Kapp-Young.
Kapp-Young's aristocratic friends persuaded her to give two public concerts, which were so successful that Anton Rubinstein and Piatti engaged her for their concerts in Vienna, where she lived with her mother. She was then called to court concerts in Vienna, Prague, and Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In Munich, her concerts brought an invitation to sing in opera. On 13 May 1860, Kapp-Young made her operatic debut, singing with her brother, Frederic, in "La Juive", and under his guidance, while he sang Eleasar, her Rachelle was, a success. After that, she appeared in London under the auspices and at the residence of Viscountess Palmerston, her crowning triumph being in a concert given by Queen Victoria in the Golden Room of Buckingham Palace to the King of Belgium. Her teachers in dramatic action were her brother, Frederic, and his wife, and Lucile Grahn. After appearing in the Royal Theater, Hanover, she was called to Frankfurt am Main, and then to the Grand Duchy of Hesse-Cassel. At the request of the Intendant, she made her debut there as Lucrezia. Her Valentine in "Les Huguenots", Fides in "Le prophète", and Leonore in "Fidelio" made an impression. Hermann Levi, then leader of the Grand Opera in Rotterdam, engaged her after her rendering of Elizabeth in "Tannhauser". Her appearance in Rotterdam as Ortrud in "Lohengrin" created a furore. After that, she appeared in Pesth, Prague, and Vienna.
The sudden death of Kapp-Young's mother caused a severe illness. A sojourn at Como restored her health so that she could sing in a festival in Bergamo. After that, she sang in Italian her great role of Valentine in La Scala, in Milan, and then filled engagements for Italian opera in Bucharest and in the Imperial Theater, Nice. The carnival of Parma followed, and there she created the role of Selika, in "L'Africaine", singing it thirty-two times in one carnival. Yianesi, the leader of the Liceu in Barcelona, engaged her after that event. The Imperial Theater of Tiflis, Russia, was her next triumph. However, at the end of the season, she contracted bronchitis. Permitted by a foolish physician and over-persuaded by the Intendant and the Prince, she sang despite her illness. An enthusiastic torchlight procession in her honor closed the evening, but she was unable to acknowledge the ovation, as that night, she was at the point of death by suffocation, in consequence of the ill-advised vocal exertion. In September, 1868, the city of Arezzo bestowed upon her, for her singing in a festival, the gold medal of merit by King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy's decree. 
Teacher.
A few months after the Arezzo festival, imagining herself cured, Kapp-Young accepted an engagement from Max Maretzek for the Academy of Music, in New York City. The stormy travel to the U.S. brought on a relapse; still, she appeared with remarkable success in "L'Africaine" at the Academy in 1868-69. At that time, she discovered in her vocal art some fortunate secrets which enabled her to overcome the difficulties brought on her by bronchitis, and the knowledge of which, thereafter, made her famous as a teacher. After one season in the U.S., she retired from the stage and went to Milan, and there, soon and often, was called upon to advise young singers.
For several years, Kapp-Young taught in Europe, but at the request of American pupils, who came in numbers to study with her, she removed to the U.S., settling in Boston. It was here, when singing in a Harvard University concert, and acting under the advice of Dr. Eben Tourjée, that she changed her name from Kapp-Young to Cappiani. During her teaching, she found time to appear occasionally in concerts. While her voice could not endure the fatigue of a whole opera, it retained its sweetness and power for short selections.
Later years.
Kapp-Young was actively connected with the Music Teachers National Association (founded in 1876) from the first, as well as with the New York State organization. When the board of examiners of the American Federation of Musicians was organized in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1884, she was the only woman elected among eighteen professors. At a subsequent meeting in New York, she was re-elected. Her essays on the voice were reproduced in many musical papers in the U.S. and foreign countries, notably in Germany. She left Boston to settle in New York in 1894. After a rest at her daughter’s home in Italy, she returned to the U.S. and resumed teaching in 1895. After 1899, Kapp-Young lived permanently in Milan. She died at Zurich, September 27, 1919.

Carrie takes a shot at interrogating Dante but doesn't get him to break. When Dante asks for a lawyer, Carrie has an idea and tells Saul "let's give him one." While this is happening, Franny, still traumatized from the previous night, has to be picked up from school by Maggie (Amy Hargreaves). When Carrie returns home, Maggie says that Carrie's treatment and neglect of Franny is downright abusive. Maggie issues an ultimatum: Carrie must admit herself to a hospital immediately, or Maggie will seek custody of Franny. Carrie argues at first, but then leaves and goes back to the secure site.
President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) is pressured to resign by Senator Paley (Dylan Baker) due to the impending testimony of Simone Martin (Sandrine Holt). Keane and Wellington (Linus Roache) decide to lean on Russia via their ambassador (Elya Baskin), with the threat that Martin's testimony would be considered a "hostile act" against the United States. Leadership in Russia takes the threat seriously, and Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin) is notified that he needs to prevent Martin's testimony. Gromov tracks down the safehouse where Martin is being held, and his men are able to distract the guards and escape with her. Gromov and Martin embrace and kiss when they are reunited.
Dante's "lawyer" (actually a man posing as one, directed by Carrie and Saul) has Dante sign some paperwork and leaves. Dante collapses and shows signs of a heart attack. Seeing the ink on his hands, Dante realizes he was poisoned the same way that McClendon was and tells Carrie the Russians were responsible, also implicating Simone Martin. Carrie and Saul get the evidence they were seeking, and then attempt to save Dante by giving him an antidote. Dante's heart temporarily stops and his survival is left in question, which becomes even more crucial to Saul and Carrie when they learn that Martin has escaped, meaning Dante is their only connection to the Russians.

Useful Idiot (Homeland)

"Useful Idiot" is the ninth episode of the seventh season of the American television drama series "Homeland", and the 81st episode overall. It premiered on Showtime on April 8, 2018.
Plot.
When Dante (Morgan Spector) awakens, Carrie (Claire Danes) persuades him to further elaborate on his collusion with Simone Martin (Sandrine Holt) and the Russians. Dante tells her of a secret code — "Darwin loves Bitcoin" — the use of which is an emergency signal meant to alert Gromov's agents to dissolve their network. Saul (Mandy Patinkin) presents a plan to Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) which pushes legal boundaries: to broadcast the code by compromising Twitter's servers, and violate the privacy of U.S. citizens by tracking who posts confirmations in response to the tweet. Keane reluctantly agrees. Keane and Wellington (Linus Roache) bring Senator Paley (Dylan Baker) into the loop, detailing Simone's and Dante's roles in the elaborate scheme to undermine the government, and Paley's own unwitting role in the subterfuge.
Clayton (Thomas G. Waites) informs Gromov (Costa Ronin) that Dante was arrested and is now in the hospital. When the cyberattack is successfully deployed by Clint (Peter Vack), Gromov realizes that Dante has to be cooperating with authorities. He calls his handler, "Mirov" (Merab Ninidze), to request aid in breaching the hospital and killing Dante, but is only told to stand down. Gromov ignores the order and meets Clayton at the hospital. Gromov then shoots Clayton in the abdomen and drags him inside. As he hands Clayton off to the doctors, he swipes one of their ID cards. He uses the card to enter Dante's room.
Carrie goes to Maggie's house to try and reconcile, but instead learns from Bill (Mackenzie Astin) that Maggie is meeting a lawyer to seek custody of Franny. When Dante accuses Gromov of poisoning him, he denies it and tells Dante to call Carrie and ask her if she was responsible. Dante calls Carrie, who is picking up Franny from school early. He realizes that Carrie is lying to him, but nonetheless he tells Carrie that Gromov is in the room with him. Gromov puts a pillow over Dante's face. Carrie opts to leave Franny at school in her rush to the hospital, but Franny runs after her and is almost accidentally run over by her mother in the parking lot. After learning that Dante is dead, Carrie has a psychotic break at the hospital as she is overwhelmed by thoughts of what she nearly did to Franny, as well as flashbacks to the deaths of Brody, Aayan and Quinn.

Clarity (Homeland)

"Clarity" is the tenth episode of the seventh season of the American television drama series "Homeland", and the 82nd episode overall. It premiered on Showtime on April 15, 2018.
Plot.
With Dante's death confirmed, the chain of evidence to vindicate President Keane falls apart. To salvage the situation, Saul's (Mandy Patinkin) plan is to exfiltrate Simone Martin from Russia. He makes a plea to Carrie (Claire Danes), asking her to lead a team of operatives to carry out the mission. Carrie declines, as she faces a custody hearing and needs to put that type of work behind her. Her lawyer, Rhonda (Adrienne C. Moore), urges her to consider a temporary custody arrangement that allows her to visit Franny every third weekend in order to avoid the hearing, but Carrie refuses. Carrie gets a visit from Anson (James D'Arcy). They discuss the upcoming hearing and how to weaken Maggie's case. Carrie notes that Maggie used to illegally treat Carrie's bipolar disorder by supplying medication and administering blood tests. Anson breaks into Maggie's office, and with a password provided by Carrie into Maggie's garage to obtain medical records that would strip Maggie of her medical license, and delivers them to Carrie.
President Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) faces an uprising from her Cabinet, who are pushing to collect enough votes to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove her from office. Only Vice President Warner's (Beau Bridges) signature is needed to complete the process. Senator Paley (Dylan Baker) meets with Warner to make his case against Keane. Keane learns of the meeting and fears the worst when she is unable to contact Warner afterwards. She goes on the offensive, firing four of the Cabinet members she suspects betrayed her so they cannot vote against her. Wellington (Linus Roache) unsuccessfully tries to dissuade her, telling her it would be political suicide, and exactly the type of crisis the Russians were trying to engender. After news of the firing goes public, Warner informs her that, after giving it thought, he never signed the document already signed by the majority of the cabinet members. He insists that she reverse course and not go through with dismissing her Cabinet members. Keane refuses, stating that because of his actions, she does not trust him and suspects he plans to sign the document anyway as he is "one signature away from the presidency." Warner said her actions are tyrannical and likely unconstitutional, and that she left him no choice but to deliver the document declaring her unfit to the President "pro tempore" of the Senate. He later petitions to the Supreme Court to declare her pre-emptive firing of the Cabinet members illegal.
At the custody hearing, numerous witnesses testify against Carrie's competency as a mother. Maggie (Amy Hargreaves) takes the stand and then addresses Carrie directly; she argues that Carrie was born to do extraordinary things but is incapable of giving Franny the stable environment she needs. Maggie states that she does not believe Carrie's promise to give up her job. During a recess, Carrie agrees to give up the custody fight and accepts the visitation agreement, negotiating to see Franny every other weekend, opting not to discredit Maggie with the medical records. At Dante's funeral, Carrie asks Saul if she can still head up the operation in Russia. He answers in the affirmative, and the episode ends with Carrie and Saul en route.

Paean to the People

"Paean to the People" is the seventh-season finale of the American television drama series "Homeland", and the 84th episode overall. It premiered on Showtime on April 29, 2018.
Plot.
Saul (Mandy Patinkin) and his team arrive at the airport, ready to fly Simone (Sandrine Holt) to the United States. Meanwhile, Yevgeny Gromov (Costa Ronin) tracks the disguised Carrie (Claire Danes), still believing she is Simone. Carrie's car is cornered, so she runs away on foot in an effort to extend the chase until Saul's plane has taken off. Saul's vehicle is stopped at a checkpoint due to an outstanding warrant for Bennet's (Ari Fliakos) arrest; Saul calls Vice President Warner (Beau Bridges) for assistance. Senator Paley (Dylan Baker), who is in the room with Warner, advises against this, as a successful retrieval of Simone would lead to Keane being reinstated as President. Warner angrily rebukes Paley and intervenes on Saul's behalf. The plane takes flight as Yevgeny captures Carrie.
Three days later.
Saul's attempts to negotiate Carrie's release with Viktor (Elya Baskin) go nowhere. Simone's testimony confirms a GRU conspiracy to undermine President Keane. Paley is arrested as a conspirator. Keane (Elizabeth Marvel) is triumphantly sworn in as President once again, but in her first public address, she resigns. She explains that as Russia was able to exploit partisan discord in the U.S., that must be addressed and that events of her administration have left her as someone the American people as a whole will be unable to trust. Yevgeny wants Carrie to film a confession video stating that Simone was a CIA operative and that the U.S. orchestrated everything, while threatening to withhold Carrie's medication if she doesn't cooperate. Carrie refuses.
Seven months later.
Carrie's release is finally secured in exchange for several Russian prisoners. Saul and Jim (Damian Young), the head of the CIA's Moscow station, oversee the prisoner exchange at the Estonia–Russia border. After seven months of receiving no medication, Carrie is barely lucid and even seems not to recognise Saul.

Murder of Blaze Bernstein

On January 10, 2018, 19-year-old University of Pennsylvania sophomore Blaze Bernstein was found dead in a park in Orange County, California, eight days after having been reported missing. He was visiting his family in Lake Forest, California, when he was killed. He had been stabbed twenty times. Two days later, Samuel Woodward, one of Bernstein's former high school classmates and a member of neo-Nazi terrorist group Atomwaffen Division, was arrested and charged with murdering Bernstein. As Bernstein was both openly gay and Jewish, authorities declared that Bernstein was a victim of a hate crime. Five deaths had links to the Atomwaffen Division over eight months from 2017 to early 2018.
Blaze Bernstein.
Bernstein was born on April 27, 1998, in South Orange County, California, to Gideon Bernstein, an equity partner at Leisure Capital Management, and Jeanne Pepper, a former lawyer who retired from law in 2000 to raise their three children. After completing high school at Orange County School of the Arts, Blaze enrolled as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania.
Legal proceedings.
The presiding judge initially charged Woodward with murder and personal use of a deadly weapon. In August 2018, two charges of committing a hate crime were added because of Bernstein's sexual orientation and religion. Woodward, who has been linked to the murder by DNA evidence, pled not guilty. A pretrial hearing was held in January 2019.
Woodward's attorney stated that Woodward suffers from Asperger syndrome and issues regarding his own sexual identity.
Woodward, who was 20 at the time of the crime, faces a sentence of life without parole if found guilty. He had initially faced a maximum sentence of 26 years in prison prior to the addition of the hate crime enhancements. Woodward‘s bail was initially set at $5 million but at hearing in November 2018, the judge decided to deny Woodward bail altogether, remanding him to custody pending trial. 
Due to the COVID crisis, Woodward has remained in confinement since his last court appearance in 2018; his trial is tentatively scheduled to begin sometime in 2021.

Quwei Jiuwen

Quwei Jiuwen (曲洧舊聞, "Old Stories from Quwei") is a Chinese "biji"-style history book written by the Song dynasty diplomat Zhu Bian during his captivity in Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty territory. He finished the book in 1138, and brought it back to his country in 1143, a year before his death.
Zhu Bian volunteered for a diplomatic mission to Jin in 1127 to visit the captured Song emperors Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong, but he was detained and not allowed to return until 1143. He was humiliated but remained loyal to the Song. It was during this period that he wrote "Quwei Jiuwen" based on what he had heard during his youth in Quwei (modern Xinzheng), where he lived before the Jurchens invaded.
"Quwei Jiuwen" in 10 chapters contains many stories about the Song emperors and their subjects. In particular, Zhu Bian blamed the decline and fall of Northern Song on the policies of Wang Anshi and Cai Jing. "Quwei Jiuwen" also contains his personal experience with Buddhism, as well as notes on poetry and supernatural stories.

Juan Ríos Ovalle

Juan Ríos Ovalle (1860–1927) was a Puerto Rican musician and composer of danzas. Among his most popular danzas are: Angelina, La Graciosita (The Little Funny One), Lluvia de Perlas (Rain of Pearls), Odalisca, and Teresa.
Early years.
Born on February 7, 1860 in Ponce, Puerto Rico into a family of musicians, Ríos Ovalle became a prolific clarinet musician and danza composer. He also composed aguinaldos, hymns, danzones and sacred music. He did not possess a lot of formal education, yet had a natural talent for music.
Professional career.
Rios Ovalle was one of the few confidants of Juan Morel Campos, among whom was also musician Cosme Tizol. While not possessing the professional stature or scale of Morel Campos, he was nevertheless considered the unquestionable successor to him, in particular when it came to danzas. Some experts believe that had Rios Ovalle been exposed to greater music education, it is possible he would have climbed much higher yet in his impact as a musician and composer.
Composer.
He created over 50 musical compositions. His danzas are characterized by their high lyrical character. Upon the untimely death of master Morel Campos in 1896, Ríos Ovalle succeeded him as the most prolific representative of Ponce's danza tradition. He authored various well known compositions, including "Angelina", "Teresa", "Rain of pearls", "Odalisque" and "La Graciosita".
Musicican.
Ríos Ovalle fine tuned his musical skills in the Juan Morel Campos's Orchestra, where he played first clarinet. His name became well known in Puerto Rico as well as among musicians and composers internationally.
Orchestra director.
In addition to his clarinet and composer skills, he was an outstanding orchestra director. His danzas are arrhythmic and his Orchestra used the güiro as the only percussion instrument.
Recordings.
He recorded with RCA Victor Records in 1917 and 1921. Some of his recording were with the Paco Tizol Orchestra.
Delicias sextet.
For many years Rios Ovalle has a sextet that performed at the famed Teatro Fox Delicias. Its job was to provide a musical background for the soundless movies of the early 20th century played there. His sextet would have a preview of the soundless movie prior to its premiere showing and they would practice for hours several nights before the movie's opening night. Renown pianist Antonia "Toñita" Príncipe ("the Princess of the keyboard") would provide coverage in the piano. In addition to soundless movies, Rios Ovalle sextet also interpreted arias for local operas voices including Aida, Lucia y Casta Susana.
Compositions.
The following is a list of some of Rios Ovalle's danzas:
Later years.
He died on 14 September 1927 in Ponce, Puerto Rico.

Perote pocket gopher

The Perote pocket gopher ("Cratogeomys perotensis"), or Cofre de Perote pocket gopher, is a species of pocket gopher in the family Geomyidae.
Range.
Endemic to Mexico, it is found in the mountains from southern Hildalgo south through Puebla and Veracruz to the volcanic edifices of Cofre de Perote and Pico de Orizaba, the former being the type locality.
Description.
This rodent is light to dark brown in color and weighs 400 to 650 g, with males being slightly larger. There are usually small white areas near the base of the tail. Its karyotype has 2n = 38 and FN = 72.
Habitat.
It inhabits Zacatonal grassland and temperate pine-oak woodlands at elevations from 2400 to 4000 m.
Taxonomic history.
Initially described as a species in 1895, "C. perotensis" was demoted to a subspecies of "C. merriami" in 1968. In 2005 it was split off again when found to be distinct in molecular, chromosomal and morphological characters. It subsumes the previously proposed taxa "C. estor" (Merriam, 1895), "C. merriami irolonis" (Nelson and Goldman, 1934), "C. irolonis" (Davis, 1944), and "C. merriami peraltus" (Goldman, 1937), and is part of the "C. castanops" species group.
Conservation status.
Although it occupies an area of less than 20,000 km2, "C. perotensis" is thought to be common and is not considered threatened.

WASP-39b

WASP-39b is a "hot Jupiter" extrasolar planet discovered in February 2011 by the WASP project, notable for containing a substantial amount of water in its atmosphere. WASP-39b is in the Virgo constellation, and is about 700 light-years from Earth.
As part of the NameExoWorlds campaigns at the 100th anniversary of the IAU, the planet was named Bocaprins, by Aruba. The planet is named after the beach Boca Prins in the Arikok National Park. The star WASP-39 was named Malmok.
Characteristics.
WASP-39b has a mass of about 0.28 times that of Jupiter and a radius about 1.27 times that of Jupiter. The exoplanet orbits WASP-39, its host star, every 4 days. Hot water molecules were found in the atmosphere of WASP-39b in a 2018 study.
WASP-39b is also notable for having an extremely low density, near that of WASP-17b. While WASP-17b has a density of g/cm3, WASP-39b has a slightly higher density of g/cm3.

Andrew Barnes (businessman)

Andrew Howard Barnes (born 5 February 1960 near Carlisle and grew up in Preston, England) is a New Zealand-based entrepreneur and philanthropist who founded New Zealand's largest corporate trustee company, Perpetual Guardian, and spearheaded the trust company's efforts to create four-day working weeks.
Education.
Barnes attended Hutton Grammar School prior to going to University of Cambridge where he completed his MA in law and archaeology at Selwyn College in 1981. He is an Associate of the Chartered Institute of Bankers (UK) and attended Harvard Business School's Program for Management Development in 1992.
Career.
Barnes began his financial services career in the United Kingdom before moving to Australia at the age of 27.
He spent 20 years in Australia, floating realestate.com.au on the ASX in 1999 and holding senior roles in companies including Macquarie Bank, Citi, Tower, and County Natwest, and was chairman of Australasian Wealth Investments.
A return to the United Kingdom saw Barnes taking on the role of director of Bestinvest.
In 2013, Barnes acquired Perpetual Trust in New Zealand, and a year later he founded Complectus and purchased Guardian Trust, creating Perpetual Guardian. In April 2015, Complectus, with Barnes as managing director, acquired e-will platform My Bucket List and in August added Foundation Corporate Trust to its list of acquisitions.
In 2020, when the Covid-19 pandemic saw New Zealand in lockdown, Barnes pushed for law changes to make digital signatures on wills legal. It has been suggested he could be one of New Zealand's next blue-chip politicians.
The Four-Day Week.
In February 2018, Barnes announced that Perpetual Guardian would be trialing four day work weeks, with staff receiving an extra day off work, on full pay, each week. Staff were not required to work additional hours on their four working days. In late March 2018, Barnes said that the trial was going well with staff reporting more time for family, hobbies, ploughing through to-do lists and home maintenance. After the end of the trial, 78% of employees stated they were able to successfully manage their work–life balance, compared to 54% in November 2017. Employees' stress levels decreased by 7 percentage points and overall life satisfaction increased by 5 percentage points.
The trial sparked widespread international interest along with commentary from workers unions, other businesses and councillors. It also generated interest from the World Economic Forum, which noted the success of the trial on its weforum.org site.
That interest grew even more when, in July 2018 at the completion of the trial, Barnes announced that the trial had been a resounding success, with productivity up 20%, staff stress levels down, customer engagement levels up more than 30%, revenue remaining stable and costs decreasing. Staff engagement and work–life balance also improved. The trial also sparked interest from the New Zealand Government. Barnes recommended to the Perpetual Guardian board that the four day work week programme continue, and it has since been rolled out on a permanent basis.
While the trial proved highly successful for most staff, a very small number of staff reported feeling more stressed or pressured to complete work in the shorter timeframe. The experience prompted the formation of the 4 Day Week Global Campaign and the appointment of a CEO, Charlotte Lockhart, in September of 2019.
The successful completion of the trial saw Barnes appearing extensively in both New Zealand and international media. He hailed the four-day work week as a potential means of helping close the gender pay gap and increasing diversity in the workforce, saying women should stop negotiating on hours and start negotiating on their productivity. That theme was picked up by other media in New Zealand. Barnes also held the model up as a potential blueprint for the workplace of the future, ensuring companies were attractive to millennials and a potential way of easing Auckland's traffic congestion. 
The trial and subsequent adoption of the four-day work week proved a topic of interest on social media too, prompting plenty of discussion across Facebook and LinkedIn and garnering mention in LinkedIn's US Daily Rundown – dubbed 'the professional news you need to know'.
In July 2018 he appeared on the Kiwi big business podcast, High Altitude, hosted by Dr John Peebles, discussing innovation, change management, philanthropy, entrepreneurship, the military, leadership, team engagement and the four day workweek initiative.
By mid-2019, the topic of a four-day week was at the forefront of global conversation about the future of work. At the International Labor Conference in Geneva in June 2019, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said it was "very likely the future will see a four-day working week as the basis of the social and labor contract." At the same time, the Bank of England's chief economist predicted that the four-day week would replace the standard five-day week for most workers by around 2050, a view endorsed by a survey of British workers. The flexible work model is being trialled in Australia, the United States, Iceland, Germany and the United Kingdom, and the European Trade Union Institute and the Trades Union Congress are campaigning for a shorter working week across much of the workforce. It remains a prominent topic in New Zealand, where Minister of Finance Grant Robertson told The Productivity Hub, "I want to see New Zealand reach a point where we are able to work 400 fewer hours a year while producing more than we do today."
As worldwide attention grew, Barnes advocated for the positive effects a four-day week could have on the climate.
By the time Barnes' book 'The 4 Day Week: How the flexible work revolution can increase productivity, profitability and well-being, and create a sustainable future' was published in January 2020, the initiative had won several global awards.
The four-day week again emerged as a prominent global talking point amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns in many countries forcing millions of people to work from home. In a Facebook Live post, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern asked business leaders to look at offering workers a four day week: "I've heard lots of people suggesting we should have a four-day week, ultimately that really sits between employers and employees... There's lots of things we've learned about COVID and just that flexibility of people working from home – the productivity that can be driven out of that." Her comments spurred a fresh wave of global media coverage of the four-day week as part of a future of work where the trend is moving away from large centralised office hubs in downtown metropolitan areas.
Philanthropy.
Barnes is a strong advocate for philanthropy. As the leader of Perpetual Guardian, he established the Perpetual Guardian Foundation, which aims to make donating easy for everyone, enabling donations of as little as $5 to be pooled for causes including feeding the hungry, educating children, supporting the arts and protecting the environment.
Under Barnes' leadership, Perpetual Guardian provided sponsorship for a program which sees 3500 children from rural or low decile schools to visit Otago Museum's planetarium each year in an attempt to encourage youngsters to become interested in science and technology.
In February 2018, Perpetual Guardian stepped in as a private sponsor for the Auckland Primary Schools Music Festival, after Barnes heard that the festival was under threat.
Perpetual Guardian also paid for the Giving New Zealand report into charitable giving in New Zealand in 2015, while Barnes himself set up the NZ Bomber Command Fund to preserve the legacy of the Bomber Command in New Zealand.
He worked with MOTAT to preserve the legacy of the Bomber Command unit through a travelling exhibition, followed by a dedicated archive at MOTAT.
Barnes also stepped in to support the Funeral Directors Association of NZ in their bid to lobby for a law change, in order for funeral directors to be able to make final arrangements for deceased persons where there is no will.
In April 2017 Barnes began a restoration of the classic yacht, Ariki. Ariki is a racing yacht which was built in Auckland, New Zealand in 1904 by the Logan Brothers. She had a distinguished career as a racing and cruising yacht. From the time of her launch in October 1904, she dominated first class Auckland yacht racing until the appearance of the yacht Ranger in 1938. She has the sail number A3.
In April 2020, when the RSA's annual Poppy Appeal had to be postponed due to Covid-19, Barnes stepped in to create a virtual solution to help raise funds. To kickstart the initiative, Barnes and Perpetual Guardian donated $25,000.
Awards.
Barnes was a finalist in the 2015 and 2016 New Zealand EY Entrepreneur of the Year awards.
Barnes also regularly takes part in the Diabetes New Zealand 'Movemeant' Challenge, and won the 2016 annual challenge

Mark Rosenzweig (economist)

Mark Richard Rosenzweig is an economist and the Frank Altschul Professor of International Economics at Yale University, where he also directs the Economic Growth Center. Rosenzweig belongs to the world's most prominent agricultural and development economists, and is one of the leading scholars on the subjects of the economics of insurance and migration.
Biography.
Mark Rosenzweig earned a B.A. from Columbia College in 1969 as well as an M.A. and Ph.D. from Columbia University in 1971 and 1973, respectively. Following his graduation, Rosenzweig worked first as an assistant professor (1973–78) and later as an associate professor of economics at Yale University (1978–79) before moving to the University of Minnesota, where he was made a full professor in 1982 and became co-director of the university's Economic Development Center. In 1990, Rosenzweig moved further as a professor of economics to the University of Pennsylvania (1990-2001), at whose Population Studies Center he has since then been a research associate and where he became the Walter H. Annenberg Professor in the Social Sciences (2001–02). Thereafter, he briefly held the position of Mohamed Kamal Professor of Public Policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (2002–05) and serving as director of the Center for International Development (2004–05). Finally, Rosenzweig returned to Yale University in 2005 as the Frank Altschul Professor of International Economics and has led Yale's Economic Growth Center as its director since 2006. Additionally, Rosenzweig has held visiting appointments at Princeton University, the University of Chicago, and Stanford University.
Mark Rosenzweig maintains affiliations with various institutions, including NBER and has worked for several national and international agencies, including the International Monetary Fund, RAND Corporation, and the National Institutes of Health. In terms of professional service, Rosenzweig served in different roles in the American Economic Association, including on its Executive Committee. Moreover, he has performed editorial duties for academic journals such as the "Review of Economics and Statistics", "Journal of Economic Literature", "World Bank Economic Review", "Journal of Development Economics", and, more recently, the "Pakistan Development Review" and "China Economic Review". Finally, Rosenzweig's research has been recognized with distinctions such as the NIH Research Service Award (1976–77), the Award for Distinguished Contribution to Scholarship in Population from the ASA (2009), the Yangtze River Scholarship (2014), and fellowships of the Econometric Society (1994), Society of Labor Economists (2006), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2013).
Research.
Mark Rosenzweig's research interests include economic development, the causes and consequences of economic development, and international migration. Geographically, his research tends to be concentrated in South Asia and more recently in China. According to IDEAS/RePEc, he ranks among the most cited 1% of economists. Moreover, he is one of the current co-editors of the "Handbook of Development Economics" (with Dani Rodrik) as well as the creator of the "Handbook of Population and Family Economics" (with Oded Stark), both of which serve as references for researchers in their respective fields. Much of Rosenzweig's research exploits natural experiments such as twin studies; nonetheless, Rosenzweig has criticized the literature of natural experiments for often not making explicit the set of behavioral, market and technological assumptions necessary to justify the studies' interpretations of estimates, resulting in findings that are sometimes highly sensitive to relaxing some of these assumptions.
The fertility decisions of rural households.
Since the mid-1970s, much of Rosenzweig's research has focused on family economics, including fertility and intra-household decisions. Early research conducted by Rosenzweig and Robert Evenson underlines the importance of the economic contributions of children to households in rural India: in particular, they find fertility and child labour to increase in the financial returns to child labour and to decrease in the wage rates of adult women. In further work with Kenneth Wolpin, Rosenzweig studied how female labour supply over the life-cycle is affected by fertility; using twins in women's first pregnancies as an unanticipated and thus exogenous variation in fertility, they find that the ratio of births to pregnancies has no effect on women's lifetime labour supply. In a similar vein, Rosenzweig and Wolpin demonstrate how twins can be used to test the hypothesis of a tradeoff between fertility and the "quality" of a household's offspring.
The economics of intrahousehold resource allocation and child health.
In a body of research closely related to his study of rural households' fertility decisions, Rosenzweig has analysed the allocation of resources within households and its consequences. Together with T. Paul Schultz, Rosenzweig examines how the allocation of resources within families responds to changes in economic conditions as well as to differences in children's genetic endowments by estimating the determinants of variations in the differentials between the survival rates of male and female children in rural India. In particular, they find that female children receive a larger share of household resources relative to male children the higher women's expected labour market participation and earnings prospects. In another study with Schultz, Rosenzweig documents how households' demand for medical care, smoking or fertility are determined by individual heterogeneity, and thereby ultimately significantly affect fetal growth and birth weight. By contrast, Rosenzweig, Mark Pitt and Mohammed Hassan investigate the impact of the inequality in the distribution of food within Bangladeshi households on household members' productivity and health; they find that both the higher level and greater variance in male calorie consumption can partly be explained by men's engagement in activities wherein productivity depends more on health status than this is generally the case for women. Finally, in a study with Jere Behrman, Rosenzweig offers evidence that returns in terms of adult schooling attainment (and partly also in terms of higher earnings) to increasing birthweight are high and are underestimated by up to 50% if genetics and family background aren't controlled for. However, Rosenzweig and Behrman also find that differences in birthweights don't play a large role in determining the world distribution of income.
Risk coping mechanisms of rural households.
In the late 1980s, Rosenzweig's research also came to address the question of how rural households cope with risk. Therein, Rosenzweig highlights the role of household structure in mitigating income volatility risks in rural areas through implicit contracts and how households' ability to mitigate risk "ex post" in turn affects households' willingness to bear risk "ex ante" through their selection of formal tenancy contracts. Another risk coping mechanism in rural areas that has been studied by Rosenzweig is nuptial migration, wherein families marry their daughters to dispersed, yet kinship-related households in order to create and strengthen a network of implicit contractual arrangements between households that enables them to diversify income risks. A non-social mechanism to smooth consumption in rural India that Rosenzweig and Wolpin find are bullocks, which present the advantage of also being usable as (durable) production assets but for which there is no permanently liquid market. Finally and more recently, Rosenzweig and Andrew D. Foster examine income transfers within families among altruistic and selfish agents under imperfect commitment in South Asian and find that imperfect commitment substantially constrains informal transfer arrangements among both kin and unrelated individuals, which confers an important role to altruism in terms of ameliorating commitment constraints and thus facilitating risk sharing.
Human capital decisions of households.
Another strand of Rosenzweig's research deals with households' decisions of how much to invest in whose human capital. Using twin experiments, Rosenzweig, Jere Behrman and Paul Taubman find that 27% of the variance in income and 42% of the variance in obesity between individuals in the United States can be explained by individuals' unique endowments. The effect of these individual endowments are further reinforced through schooling, though somewhat diluted as men with high individual endowments tend to marry less educated wives. In another study using twins, Behrman and Rosenzweig find that increasing the schooling of women doesn't increase the schooling of their children once heritable ability and assortative matching are taken into account, and instead reduces the time mothers spend at home. In research with Kaivan Munshi on the interactions between caste, gender and schooling choice under the influence of globalization in Mumbai, Rosenzweig finds that male working-class and lower-caste networks keep channelling boys into local language schools, which lead to traditional occupations with comparatively low wages; by contrast, lower caste girls, who didn't and don't benefit from the network, have switched to a much higher degree to English schools and are taking advantage of the thus broadened labour market opportunities. Finally, in a study with Junsen Zhang, Rosenzweig uses twins to investigate whether China's one-child policy increased parents' investments into human capital. Even though they find that an unexpected child significantly decreases the schooling progress, expected college enrollment, school grades and assessed health of all children in the household, the decrease isn't large enough to warrant the conclusion that the contribution of the one-child policy to the development of China's capital was substantial.
Agricultural investments and technological change in agriculture.
Another major body of research by Rosenzweig has been the study of agricultural investments (generally with Hans Binswanger) and of the diffusion of technology in agriculture (mostly with Andrew D. Foster). With Binswanger, Rosenzweig has developed an influential model of agricultural production and its behavioural and material determinants that facilitates the analysis of barriers to the emergence of rural financial markets and efficient agricultural factor markets, along further implications. In another study, Rosenzweig and Binswanger describe how agricultural output is developed in a "complex interactive process" between farmers, government and financial intermediaries. The availability of education infrastructure and rural banks are strong determinants of agricultural investment and agricultural output's responsiveness to prices, with public infrastructure investments in turn being determined by agroclimatic potential and bank locations being influenced by public infrastructure investments. Finally, Rosenzweig and Binswanger document how farmers adapt the composition of their agricultural investments in response to the exposure of the profitability of their agricultural activities to weather risk.
In their work on technical change in agriculture, Rosenzweig and Foster analyse the adoption and profitability of high-yielding varieties (HYVs) in rural India during the Green Revolution; they find that farmers' lack of knowledge of how to manage the seeds was initially a major barrier to their adoption but gradually diminished over time as farmers' own experience as well as the experience of their fellow farmers with HYVs increased the profitability of HYVs through mutual learning; had farmers taken these learning spillovers into account in their decisions to adopt HYVs, the process of HYV diffusion would have been faster. In another study in rural India, Foster and Rosenzweig later assess how technological change during the Green Revolution affected returns to human capitals and investments; they find that the returns to (primary) schooling increased along with technical change and that the increases in these returns then induced households to invest more into schooling and fostered the availability of schools, which in turn increased the population's level of schooling. Reviewing the literature on the microeconomics of technological diffusion with a focus on developing countries, Foster and Rosenzweig identify the financial and nonfinancial returns to the adoption of technologies, one's own learning and social learning about technology use, technological externalities, economies of scale, schooling, credit constraints, risk and incomplete insurance, and "irrational" behaviour as factors affecting economic agents' adoption of new technologies and/or inputs complementary with such new technologies.
Awards.
In 2017, Rosenzweig and his coauthor, Junsen Zhang, received the Sun Yefang Award for economics science, one of the highest economics honors in China, for their article "Do Population Control Policies Induce More Human Capital Investment? Twins, Birth Weight and China's "One-Child" Policy".

Asilia Guillén

Asilia Guillén (1887–1964) was a Nicaraguan folk artist, specializing in embroidery and painting.
Guillén was born in Granada, Nicaragua, into a patrician family. She received an education typical for a young woman of her station, learning embroidery and music among other subjects. She worked in embroidery for much of her artistic life, in line with the tradition of the "bordados granadinos" produced by the city of her birth. She took up painting at the age of sixty-five; once discovered by poet Enrique Fernández Morales, she took classes with Rodrigo Peñalba, at the time director of the School of Fine Arts in Managua. Early in her career she showed work at the São Paulo Art Biennial. In 1957 she was one of the six artists included in the group exhibition "6 Artists of Nicaragua" organized by the Organization of American States; soon thereafter she was taken up by José Gómez-Sicre, who ensured that her work gained exposure in Latin America and further afield. Her paintings were shown at the Mexican Inter-American Bienal and in exhibits in Knokke and Baden-Baden, and in 1962 she exhibited eighteen works in Washington, D.C. in her first solo show; she visited under the auspices of the United States Department of State, and gained further international recognition as a result. Gómez Sicre commissioned another work from her in 1964, titled "The Founders of the Americas Meet on the Islands of Lake Granada" and designed for inclusion in the Central American and Panama Pavilion at the 1964 World's Fair. For a time Guillén lived at the Solentiname art colony, becoming acquainted with its founder, Ernesto Cardenal.
Stylistically, the embroideries Guillén produced at the beginning of her career grew more elaborate as she developed, moving from traditional floral motifs to more complicated landscapes and historical scenes. Her paintings, which depict similar scenes, are known for their intricate detail. She drew much of her inspiration from the history and vistas of her native city. Two of her paintings, both oils on canvas, are owned by the Art Museum of the Americas; they are "Rafaela Herrera Defends the Castle from Pirates" of 1962 and "Heroes and Artists Come to the Pan American Union To Be Consecrated" of the same year.

Wang Cheng

Wang Cheng (died 1200), courtesy name Jiping, was a Song dynasty historian who authored the monumental history book "Dongdu Shilüe". He also published 4 volumes of poetry which are no longer extant.
Biography.
Wang Cheng's ancestral home was Mei Prefecture, but since his father Wang Shang (王賞) and grandfather Wang Huai (王淮) were both officials, it's unlikely Wang Cheng was born there. His father Wang Shang worked in the editorial office for the Veritable Records in 1142–1143 and had access to a lot of government information, which was an important source for Wang Cheng's "Dongdu Shilüe". In 1178, historian Hong Mai submitted a memorial to Emperor Xiaozong in which he recommended "Dongdu Shilüe" as highly valuable for his compilation of the "National History of Four Emperors" (四朝國史). Emperor Xiaozong then granted Wang Cheng an office in Long Prefecture as a Gentleman for Discussion (承議郎).

Ursuline Church of St. Michael

The Ursuline Church in Linz, Austria, dedicated to Archangel Michael, was built between 1736 and 1772 for the local Ursulines. It has two towers and a late baroque facade. The design was done by the architect Johann Haslinger. The church was dedicated in 1757.
It is connected to the former Ursuline convent, today a cultural center.
Architecture, interior.
Inside the church are altar pieces by Bartolomeo Altomonte.
The high altar was designed by Johann Matthias Krinner, and dedicated in 1741. The altar piece dates from 1738–1740, and is by Martino Altomonte. It shows the Archangel Michael in the center, surrounded by the archangels Gabriel and Raphael.
The late baroque chancel, from 1740, shows three scenes, "Raphael walking with Tobias", "Jacob's Dream", and "The Sacrifice of Manoah". The chancel's sounding board shows the (then) four parts of the world: Europe, Asia, Africa, and America.
Since its restoration in 1985 the church serves as an art center and concert hall, and as parish church for the "Forum St. Severin (Katholischer Akademikerverband der Diözese Linz)".

Bob Snyder (artist)

Bob Snyder (born October 3, 1946) is an American composer, sound and video artist, currently working and living in Chicago. His work focuses on the formal relations between electronic sounds and images, using synthesized visual and audio signals as his main medium. Throughout his career he has worked extensively with Sandin Image Processor, and his work has been featured in two Whitney Biennal exhibitions as well as institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the New York Public library and the Art Institute of Chicago. Several of his works have been made in collaboration with the artists Phil Morton, Tom DeFanti and Dan Sandin. Snyder is also the founder of the sound department at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in its present form, where he is Professor Emeritus. He is the author of the book "Music and Memory: a Brief Introduction" published by the MIT Press .
He is also the author of the "Memory for Music" chapter in the 2009 and 2016 editions of the "Oxford Handbook of Music Psychology".
Early life.
Snyder was born in 1946, in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Between 1962 and 1965 he attended the Interlochen Arts Academy boarding high school where he played bass clarinet in the touring orchestra. After graduating, Snyder studied composition and improvisation under the guidance of Bill Mathieu and Marjorie Hyams. Interested in both painting and music, Snyder pursued formal education in composition at Indiana University's Bachelor of Music program, enrolling in 1966. He later transferred to Roosevelt University where he completed his BM in 1970. He received his Master of Music from Roosevelt in 1972. During his studies he became interested in electronic music and began using an oscilloscope to explore the relation between audio and visual signals.
Electronic visualization events.
Shortly after graduating, Snyder enrolled into Dan Sandin's video art class at the University of Illinois Chicago in Chicago, where he was introduced to and began working with Sandin's Image Processor (IP). He later joined the "Circle Graphics Habitat" (today "Electronic Visualization Laboratory"), an interdisciplinary research group developed by Sandin and Tom DeFanti between 1973-75 that centered around the IP and DeFanti's Graphic Symbiosis System (GRASS). While working with Sandin and DeFanti, Snyder met Phil Morton who at that time was teaching at the School of the Art Institute (SAIC) in Chicago. Snyder joined SAIC's faculty in 1974 and in 1976 became the head of the Sound Area, later expanded into School of the Art Institute's Sound Department.
Together with the community of electronic media artists including Phil Morton, Dan Sandin, Tom DeFanti, Jane Veeder, Jamie Fenton, Barbara Sykes and others, Snyder participated in the Electronic Visualization Events (EVE) organized by the Circle Graphics Habitat—a series of group shows focusing on experimental media performance and image processing. The first iteration of EVE, held in April 1975, featured a collaborative performance by Snyder-Morton-Sandin-DeFanti called "Peano Boogie", an improvised piece for which Snyder provided the soundtrack. The group performed again a year later at the second EVE, showing their interactive work "Ryral", for which Snyder used SAIC's EMU sound synthesizer. In the third event, which took place in May 1978, the group, joined by Jane Veeder, Sticks Raboin and Rylin Harris, performed a piece called "Spiral 3". During the show Snyder's collaboration with Morton and Guenther Tetz titled "Data Bursts in 3 moves" was also shown.
Individual works.
Snyder began recording his own IP experiments on videotape in 1974, eventually assembling his own copy of the machine. In his individual practice, Snyder focused on exploring video's and sound's shared formal properties. As he has explained in the article "Video Color Control by Means of an Equal-Tempered  Keyboard" :
My hope was that both light and sound could be controlled from the same set of formal assumptions, and that I could develop characteristic interval structures which would operate successfully in both areas.
In "Lines of Force", created in 1979 and later featured in the Whitney Biennale's Video Program in 1981, abstract synthesized images are modulated with found-footage, such as video documentation of military tests and various recordings of television broadcast. Edited through a series of match-cuts, the piece follows a logic of a visual pun, juxtaposing shots sharing visual similarities. The soundtrack for the piece was composed after the visual part was finished.
In 1981, Snyder completed "Trim Subdivisions", which has been featured at MoMA, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Whitney Museum. Shot in suburban Indiana, and unlike most of Snyder's work, "Trim Subdivision" has no sound, and uses a wide range of editing techniques such as wipe-cuts in a playful deconstruction of site's uniform architecture.
From 1979 to 1984 he worked on his piece "Spectral Brands", which was the first piece in which Snyder used the Image Processor keyboard interface. The instrument allowed for the increased control over the machine, dividing its color space into 34220 separate colors organized according to the modified equal temperament tuning system.
In the late 2000s, Snyder produced a series of sound installations through Chicago's Experimental Sound Studio, including projects such as "Orniphonia 2," made in 2013 as part of the ESS's "Florasonic" series, and "Pseudorniphones", installed for the 2005 "Outer Ear Festival of Sound" in Chicago. For both of the works, Snyder created intricate soundscapes composed out of synthesized audio signals mimicking the sounds of songbirds.
In 2018, Snyder work was included in the Chicago 1973-1992 exhibition at Gallery 400. The exhibition was curated by jonCates.

Father of Asahd

Father of Asahd is the eleventh studio album by American hip hop producer DJ Khaled. It was released on May 17, 2019, through We the Best Music and Epic Records. It features the singles "Top Off" and "No Brainer" along with collaborations with Cardi B, 21 Savage and Meek Mill. On May 16, DJ Khaled revealed the track listing and features, as well as that the music videos for "Higher", "Just Us", "Celebrate", "Jealous" and "Holy Mountain" would be released throughout the day of May 17, followed by the video for "You Stay" on May 18, and "Wish Wish" and "Weather the Storm" on May 20. DJ Khaled scored his third career Grammy nomination with "Higher" which won the Best Rap/Sung Performance at the 62nd Grammy Awards.
Background.
In March 2018, DJ Khaled announced the title, upon releasing the lead single, called "Top Off". He named the album after his eldest child, Asahd Tuck Khaled. In March 2019, he announced the release date, while in the meantime, promoting the album extensively on his social media accounts. He also posted a trailer for the album. DJ Khaled has also teased numerous collaborations on his social media, which, along with Future, Jay-Z and Beyoncé on "Top Off", and Justin Bieber, Chance the Rapper and Quavo on "No Brainer", include J Balvin, Cardi B, Meek Mill, Post Malone, Travis Scott, Chief Keef, Bryson Tiller, and 2 Chainz. In April 2019, TMZ reported that "Higher" featuring Nipsey Hussle and John Legend would appear on the album. DJ Khaled, Nipsey Hussle, and John Legend shot the music video before Nipsey's death on March 31, 2019.
Critical reception.
"Father of Asahd" received mixed reviews among critics. On Metacritic which assigns a rating of up to 100, the album received an average of 59, indicating "Mixed or average reviews" based on 7 critics.
Andy Kellman of AllMusic gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5 and also noted in his review on the album by saying "Although instant, maximum commercial impact is no doubt the primary objective, the album does come across as more considered than the average Khaled LP."
Commercial performance.
"Father of Asahd" debuted at number two on the US "Billboard" 200 with 136,000 album-equivalent units, with 34,000 copies as pure album sales in its first week. In the second week, the album remained at number two on the chart, earning an additional 58,000 album-equivalent units. In its third week, the album dropped to number three on the chart, earning 39,000 more units. In its fourth week, the album dropped to number eight on the chart, earning 31,000 more units, bringing its four-week total to 264,000 album-equivalent units. On May 17, 2020, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 1,000,000 units in the United States.
Controversy.
On June 5, 2019, sources reported DJ Khaled was fuming at his label after "Father of Asahd" failed to debut at the top of the "Billboard" 200. He reportedly blamed his label chiefs for not understanding streaming services and bundle deals, in connection with an estimated 100,000 downloads of his album that were sold through a bundle deal with an energy drink that weren't included in his sales by "Billboard". "Father of Asahd" debuted behind American rapper and record producer Tyler, the Creator's fifth studio album, "Igor".
On June 6, DJ Khaled posted a now-deleted video on his Instagram page that many believe was aimed at Tyler, the Creator after his album beat out "Father of Asahd" for the number one spot on the "Billboard" charts. In the video, Khaled stated, "Here's the thing, I make albums so people can play it. And you actually hear it. You know, driving your car you hear another car playing it. Go to the barber shop, you hear them playing it. You know, turn the radio on, and you hear them playing it. It's playing everywhere - it's called great music. It's called albums that you actually hear the songs. Not no mysterious shit, and you never hear it."

Top Off

"Top Off" is a song recorded by American record producer DJ Khaled, featuring guest vocals from American rappers Jay-Z and Future and singer Beyoncé (credited as "B"). The artists co-wrote the song with Joe Zarrillo, who co-produced it with Khaled and Beyoncé. It was released on March 2, 2018, as the lead single from Khaled's eleventh studio album, "Father of Asahd". "Complex" magazine ranked Beyoncé's verse on the song as the second best on the album.
Release and promotion.
On February 28, 2018, DJ Khaled announced that he would reveal the title of his upcoming album and release its lead single on March 1, 2018. Prior to the release, Khaled posted a video of him playing the song for comedian Kevin Hart, who reacted by saying: "The world flatlined."
Critical reception.
"Top Off" received mixed reviews from critics. According to "Billboard"s Gil Kaufman, "Top Off" is "a breathless outlaw track about outrunning the police and enjoying the finer things". Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" disliked Future's verse, writing: "Once you swipe away the numbing hook and pseudo-verse from Future, there, plain as day, is an impressive Jay-Z/Beyoncé duet." Larry Fitzmaurice of "Pitchfork" gave a negative review of the song, writing that it is "more bland than it is bizarrely successful, proof that Khaled's blockbuster-stuffed style often suffocates under the heft of its own bravado". He opined that the artists' personalities "are simply too distinct at this point to produce something compelling when shoved together on the same track". Pat King of "Metro" named it "one of the catchiest songs in recent memory about outrunning the cops". Adreon Patterson of "Paste" felt that "the track is a little underwhelming considering the collaborators' musical status". Serving as a follow-up to "Shining" and "I Got the Keys", he found the song "disappointing and anti-climactic". Tom Breihan of Stereogum praised Khaled for making the song sounds like both a "fame-flexing celebrity event" and an "actual song". Lauren O'Neill of "Noisey" complimented Beyoncé's ability "to knock every other rapper out of the park with her skill and flow". Bianca Gracie of Fuse declared that the song lacks innovation and fails to be memorable. "Jay-Z and Beyoncé deserve a harder beat underneath their flows; the juvenile SoundCloud production didn't do them any favors especially on Beyoncé's opening part." Following the release of "Father of Asahd", Frazier Tharpe of "Complex" magazine ranked the features on the album, with Beyoncé's verse on "Top Off" coming in 2nd, behind Nipsey Hussle's verse on "Higher". Tharpe commented that "if there's any benefit to keeping this old dog of a song on the album, it's giving this blackout verse from B a proper home".

Filmmaking technique of Luis Buñuel

Luis Buñuel Portolés (; 22 February 1900 – 29 July 1983) was a Spanish filmmaker who worked in Spain, Mexico and France. Buñuel is noted for his distinctive use of mise-en scene, distinctive sound editing, and original use of music in his films. Often Buñuel applies the techniques of mise-en-scène to combine multiple single scenes within a film directed by him to represent more encompassing aspects of the film when viewed as a whole.
The staging of scenes in his films was a central motif in Buñuel's filmmaking. Buñuel's films are often sparse in their design and rely on surrealistic elements often without hesitation. The design aspect of Buñuel's filmmaking remained artistically distinctive, essentially combined the creation of "visual themes" with the "telling of a story", almost always in visually striking ways by combining cinematography and set design, and in poetically artful ways through his direction.
Buñuel's filmmaking technique was influenced by many aspects of his personality which included sharp contrasts of character and self-identity. His first picture, "Un Chien Andalou"—made in the silent era—was called "the most famous short film ever made" by critic Roger Ebert, and his last film, "That Obscure Object of Desire"—made 48 years later—won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics. Writer Octavio Paz called Buñuel's work "the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality...scandalous and subversive".
Often associated with the surrealist movement of the 1920s, Buñuel created films from the 1920s through the 1970s. His work spans two continents, three languages, and an array of genres, including experimental film, documentary, melodrama, satire, musical, erotica, comedy, romance, costume dramas, fantasy, crime film, adventure, and western. Six of Buñuel's films are included in "Sight &amp; Sound"'s 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the "They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?" list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with John Ford for second most, and he ranks number 13 on their list of the top 250 directors.
Style of directing.
Buñuel's style of directing was extremely economical; he shot films in a few weeks, rarely deviating from his script and shooting in order as much as possible to minimize editing time. He remained true throughout his working life to an operating philosophy that he articulated at the beginning of his career in 1928: "The guiding idea, the silent procession of images that are concrete, decisive, measured in space and time—in a word, the film—was first projected inside the brain of the filmmaker". In this, Buñuel has been compared with Alfred Hitchcock, another director famous for precision, efficiency and preplanning, for whom actually shooting the film was an anticlimax, since each man would know, in Buñuel's words, "exactly how each scene will be shot and what the final montage will be". According to actress Jeanne Moreau: "He was the only director I know who never threw away a shot. He had the film in his mind. When he said 'action' and 'cut,' you knew that what was in between the two would be printed."
As much as possible, Buñuel preferred to work with actors and crew members with whom he had worked before and whom he trusted, leading some critics to refer to these people as a "stock company", including such performers as: Fernando Rey, Francisco Rabal, Pierre Clementi, Julien Bertheau, Michel Piccoli, Claudio Brook, Silvia Pinal, Paul Frankeur and Georges Marchal. In his final film, "That Obscure Object of Desire", the central character was played by Rey, but voiced by the French-speaking Piccoli. He told actors as little as possible, and limited his directions mostly to physical movements ("move to the right", "walk down the hall and go through that door", etc.), arguing that he had a better chance of capturing reality with inexperienced players who projected a desired sense of awkwardness. He often refused to answer actors' questions and was known to simply turn off his hearing aid on the set. One of his stars, Catherine Deneuve, has stated: "I've always thought that he likes actors, up to a point. I think he likes very much the idea of the film, and to write it. But I had the impression that the film-making was not what he preferred to do. He had to go through actors, and he liked them if they were easy, simple, not too much fuss." Though they found it difficult at the time, many actors who worked with him acknowledged later that his approach made for fresh and excellent performances.
Buñuel preferred scenes that could simply be pieced together end-to-end in the editing room, resulting in long, mobile, wide shots which followed the action of the scene. Filmmaker Patricia Gruben has attributed this procedure to a long-standing strategy on Buñuel's part intended to thwart external interference: "he would make the whole scene in long four-minute dolly shots so the producers couldn't cut it". Examples are especially present in his French films. For example, at the ski resort's restaurant in "Belle de jour", Séverin, Pierre, and Henri converse at a table. Buñuel cuts away from their conversation to two young women, who walk down a few steps and proceed through the restaurant, passing behind Séverin, Pierre, and Henri, at which point the camera stops and the young women walk out of frame. Henri then comments on the women and the conversation at the table progresses from there.
Mise-en-scène.
Critics have remarked on Buñuel's predilection for developing a surrealist mise-en-scène through use of a deceptively sparse naturalism, as Michael Atkinson has put it: "visually Spartan and yet spasming with bouts of the irrational." Buñuel's visual style has been generally characterized as highly functional and uncluttered, with extraneous detail eliminated on sets to focus on character-defining elements.
As an example, Buñuel has told about one of his experiences with cameraman Gabriel Figueroa, a veteran who had become famous in cinematography circles by making a specialty of illuminating the beauty of the Mexican landscape using photographic chiaroscuro (stark contrast between illuminated space and dark shadows). Figueroa had set up a shot for "Nazarín" near the valley of the Popocatépetl: "It was during this shoot that I scandalized Gabriel Figueroa, who had prepared for me an aesthetically irreproachable framing, with the Popocatépetl in the background and the inevitable white clouds. I simply turned the camera to frame a banal scene that seemed to me more real, more proximate. I have never liked refabricated cinematographic beauty, which very often makes one forget what the film wants to tell, and which personally, does not move me."
Actress Catherine Deneuve has provided another anecdote illustrating this aspect of Buñuel's style: while shooting "Tristana", he had told her frequently of the distaste he felt for the "touristy" side of Toledo, where the film was made, so she teased him about one crane shot that brought out the beauty of the surrounding landscape, to which Buñuel responded by re-shooting the entire scene from a dolly with no background whatsoever, all the while inveighing against the "obviously" beautiful.
Sound.
Buñuel has been hailed as a pioneer of the sound film, with "L'Age d'Or" being cited as one of the first innovative uses of sound in French film. Film scholar Linda Williams has pointed out that Buñuel used sounds, including music, as nonsynchronous counterpoint to the visual image, rather than redundant accompaniment, in accordance with theories that had been advanced by Sergei Eisenstein and others in a 1928 manifesto on the sound film. Critic Marsha Kinder has posited that Buñuel's years as a film dubber in Europe and Hollywood put him in the position of "mastering the conventions of film sound, to subvert them more effectively". In his later years, Buñuel was almost completely deaf, but he continued to assert control over the sound effects in his films, such as "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie", in which seemingly important speech, especially political discourse, is often drowned out by the noise of urban life, in such a systematic manner that Kinder has identified Buñuel as one of the first professional sound designers in cinema. As further illustration of this, scholar Sally Faulkner has described the means by which, in his film "Tristana", Buñuel "engineers a kind of figurative deafness, or disability, in the spectator" in scenes which involve deaf characters, by, for example, combining the sound of gushing water with an image of a stagnant pool, or exaggerating the volume level of chiming bells.
Music.
Music is an important part of Buñuel's early films, to such an extent that, for his one silent film "Un Chien Andalou", in his sixties, he took the trouble to create a sonorised version. He based this version on the music (Wagner, a South American tango) played at its original screening. "Un Chien Andalou" was his first film—made in the silent era—and was called "the most famous short film ever made" by critic Roger Ebert. One critic has noted that, in "L'Age d'Or", Buñuel employed the music of Beethoven, Mozart, Mendelssohn, Debussy and Wagner "as a kind of connective tissue for, and aural commentary on, the unnerving visuals." As regards "Las Hurdes", critics have often remarked on the "nagging inappropriateness" of the score, the fourth movement of Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 4 in E Minor, a practice called by James Clifford "fortuitous or ironic collage." Although Buñuel's use of this technique declined in frequency over the years, he still occasionally employed incongruous musical juxtaposition for ironic effect, notably during the opening and the climactic scenes of Viridiana, which take place to the strains of Handel's Hallelujah Chorus, in pointed contrast to the jazz music played during the film's final scene of the card game.
Late in life, Buñuel claimed to dislike non-diegetic music (music not intrinsic to the scene itself) and avoided its use, stating: "In my last films I rarely use music. If I do, it has to be justified, so the viewer can see its source: a gramophone or a piano." One consistent exception, however, is the use of the traditional drums from his birthplace Calanda, which are heard in most of his films, with such regularity that the repetition has been described as a "biofilmographic signature". Buñuel's explanation of his use of these drums was the statement: "Nowhere are they beaten with such mysterious power as in Calanda...in recognition of the shadows that covered the earth at the moment Christ died."
The films of his second French era were not scored and some ("Belle de jour", "Diary of a Chambermaid") are without music entirely. "Belle de jour" does, however, feature non-diegetic sound effects, "to unify spatially incongruous shots or symbolize [the protagonist's] dream world."
Influences on Bunuel's filmmaking.
Surrealism.
When his first film was released, Buñuel became the first filmmaker to be officially welcomed into the ranks of the Surrealists by the movement's leader André Breton, an event recalled by film historian Georges Sadoul: "Breton had convoked the creators to our usual venue [the Café Radio]... one summer's evening. Dalí had the large eyes, grace, and timidity of a gazelle. To us, Buñuel, big and athletic, his black eyes protruding a little, seemed exactly like he always is in "Un Chien Andalou", meticulously honing the razor that will slice the open eye in two." After he joined the Communist Party in Spain, however, it was quickly made clear to him that he could not be both a Communist and a Surrealist; his artistic collaborator Pierre Unik recounted in a letter of 30 January 1932 that "a comrade from Agit-Prop" called Buñuel and others together to tell them that, "Surrealism was a movement of bourgeois degeneration", continuing, "What will the rank-and-file comrades say the day I have to announce to them, 'Comrades, I no longer have the right to militate amongst you...because I'm a degenerate bourgeois?'" In consequence, on 6 May 1932, Buñuel wrote a letter to André Breton renouncing his membership in the Surrealist group: "Given the current state of things there could be no question for a Communist of doubting for an instant between the choice of his party and any other sort of activity or discipline". He even went so far as to try to re-issue a drastically cut version of "L'Age d'Or" (over two-thirds of the original were eliminated) in response to complaints that the full 60-minute original was formally too difficult for the proletariat. Nonetheless, he retained a lifelong affinity with the Surrealist movement and longstanding friendships with many of the most prominent Surrealists.
Buñuel's films were famous for their surreal imagery, including scenes in which chickens populate nightmares, women grow beards, and aspiring saints are desired by lascivious women. Even in the many movies he made for hire (rather than for his own creative reasons), such as "Susana" and "The Great Madcap", he usually added his trademark of disturbing and surreal images. Some critics have pointed out that one reason why Buñuel found working in Mexico so congenial was that what might seem unusual or even outlandish in Europe or the United States fit comfortably with elements of Mexican culture and the audience's expectations of national melodrama. As filmmaker Tomás Pérez Turrent has commented, when referring to the apparently incredible features that many critics find in Buñuel's films: "In Mexico, it's believable", while one of the founders of Surrealism, André Breton, called Mexico, "the most surrealist country in the world."
Certainly, running through the more personal films of Buñuel's early and late years is a backbone of surrealism. Two or three examples suffice to demonstrate the point of the endemic quality of Buñuel's use of surrealism. One example of surrealism in Buñuel's world is one found when an entire dinner party suddenly finds itself inexplicably unable to leave the room and go home. In another example of Buñuel's applied use of surrealism, a bad dream hands a man a letter which he brings to the doctor the next day; and in another where the devil, if unable to tempt a saint with a pretty girl, will fly him to a disco. An example of a more Dada influence can be found in "Cet obscur objet du désir", when Mathieu closes his eyes and has his valet spin him around and direct him to a map on the wall. This was his last film, where the title was translated as "That Obscure Object of Desire"—made 48 years after his first silent film—which won him Best Director awards from the National Board of Review and the National Society of Film Critics.
Buñuel never explained or promoted his work, remaining true to his and Dalí's early insistence on the completely irrational and defying symbolic interpretation. On one occasion, when his son was interviewed about "The Exterminating Angel", Buñuel instructed him to give facetious answers. As examples, when asked about the presence of a bear in the socialites' house, Buñuel "fils" claimed it was because his father liked bears, and, similarly, the several repeated scenes in the film were explained as having been put there to increase the running time.
Entomology.
As a university student, Buñuel had studied entomology at the Museum of Natural History under the famous naturalist Ignacio Bolívar, and he had an early and lasting interest in the scientific documentaries of Jean Painlevé, which he tried to screen at the Residencia de Estudiantes. Numerous critics have commented on the number of sequences in his films involving insects, from the death's head moth in "Un chien andalou" and the extended scorpion scenes in "L'Age d'or" to the framed tarantula in "Le Fantôme de la liberté". Others have commented on the dispassionate nature of Buñuel's treatment of his characters, likening it to the stance of the entomological researcher, and Buñuel himself once said that he had an "entomological" interest in the protagonist of his film "El". The writer Henry Miller observed: "Buñuel, like an entomologist, has studied what we call love in order to expose beneath the ideology, mythology, platitudes and phraseologies the complete and bloody machinery of sex." The writer Octavio Paz also called Buñuel's work "the marriage of the film image to the poetic image, creating a new reality … scandalous and subversive".
Religion and atheism.
Buñuel's filmmaking technique was influenced by many aspects of his personality, which included his skepticism of religion, as evidenced in "The New York Times" which called him "an iconoclast, moralist, and revolutionary who was a leader of avant-garde surrealism in his youth and a dominant international movie director half a century later". Many of his films were openly critical of bourgeois morals and organized religion, mocking the Roman Catholic Church in particular but religion in general, for its hypocrisy. When asked if it was intention to blaspheme in his films, Buñuel responded, "I didn't deliberately set out to be blasphemous, but then Pope John XXIII is a better judge of such things than I am." Many of his most famous films demonstrate this irreverent spirit:
Buñuel is often cited as one of the world's most prominent atheists. In a 1960 interview, he was asked about his attitude toward religion, and his response has become one of his most celebrated quotes: "I'm still an atheist, thank God." But his entire answer to the question was somewhat more nuanced: "I have no attitude. I was raised in it. I could answer "I'm still an atheist, thank God." I believe we must seek God within man himself. This is a very simple attitude." Critics have pointed out that Buñuel's atheism was closely connected to his surrealism, in that he considered chance and mystery, and not providence, to be at the heart of all reality.
Seventeen years later, in an interview with the "New Yorker", Buñuel expressed a somewhat different opinion about religion and atheism: "I'm not a Christian, but I'm not an atheist either, ... I'm weary of hearing that accidental old aphorism of mine, 'I'm not an atheist, thank God.' It's outworn. Dead leaves. In 1951, I made a small film called 'Mexican Bus Ride', about a village too poor to support a church and a priest. The place was serene, because no one suffered from guilt. It's guilt we must escape, not God." However, in 1982, Buñuel had reaffirmed his atheism in his autobiography. Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes has commented that Buñuel represents one of the most compelling intellectual tendencies of the twentieth century: "religious temperament without religious faith."
Legacy of filmmaking.
Six of Buñuel's films are included in "Sight &amp; Sound"'s 2012 critics' poll of the top 250 films of all time. Fifteen of his films are included in the "They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?" list of the 1,000 greatest films of all time, which is tied with John Ford for second most, and he ranks number 13 on their list of the top 250 directors.

Antoinette Szumowska

Antoinette Szumowska (February 22, 1868 — August 16, 1938), originally Antonina Szumowska, later Antoinette Szumowska-Adamowska, was a Polish pianist and piano teacher.
Early life.
Antonina Szumowska was born near Lublin. Her father, a professor, had been a political exile in Siberia. She was educated in Warsaw. After college, she studied piano at a conservatory in Warsaw, with and Aleksander Michałowski. Szumowska moved to Paris in 1890, where she used the French form of her first name ("Antoinette"), and studied with Ignacy Jan Paderewski for five years. "My lessons with Paderewski were somewhat irregular," she explained later. "We worked together whenever he came to Paris. Sometimes I did not see him for several months, and then he would be in Paris for a number of weeks; at such seasons we worked together very often." 
Career.
Szumowska made her debut in Paris in 1891, and in London the following year. She performed on a tour of Great Britain in 1893. In 1895 she made her first trip to the United States, where she played in Boston and at Madison Square Garden in New York, and at the inaugural concert in Steinway Hall in Chicago. Szumowska gave special concerts and wrote "An Appreciation of Chopin" for "The Etude" magazine, on the occasion of the Polish composer's centennial in 1910. She was a member of the Adamowski Trio with her husband and his brother, Timothee Adamowski.
During and after World War I, Szumowska was president of the New England branch of the Friends of Poland, a relief organization. She raised money and went to Warsaw in 1920 to coordinate distribution of food and clothing. For her contributions she was awarded the Officer's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, in 1924, a decoration presented by her former teacher Paderewski. In 1921 she resumed her performing career, with a concert in Boston. "Mme. Szumowska has lost none of her technical skill," an American magazine noted; "Her runs are rippling and smooth, her trill is hardly to be equalled, and her masterful playing in general was a welcome revelation to the audience."
Szumowska taught at the New England Conservatory of Music. Among her students were Jesús María Sanromá and Dai Buell.
Personal life.
Antoinette Szumowska married cellist Josef Adamowski in 1896. They had two children, Helene (Helenka) and Thaddeus (Tadeusz). They lived in Massachusetts and had a summer home on Sutton Island. She was widowed in 1930, and died in 1938, aged 70 years.
Her daughter Helene Adamowska became an actress and humanitarian under the name Helenka Pantaleoni. Her son Tadeusz Adamowski became an athlete at Harvard University, and went on to play ice hockey for Poland in the 1928 Winter Olympics, before serving in the Polish army during World War II. Both of her children were active on behalf of UNICEF later in their lives. Actress Téa Leoni is the great-granddaughter of Antoinette Szumowska.

Anthony Cirelli

Anthony Cirelli (, ; born July 15, 1997) is a Canadian professional ice hockey center who is currently playing for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was selected by the Lightning in the third round (72nd overall) of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. Cirelli won back-to-back Stanley Cups with the Lightning in 2020 and 2021.
Playing career.
Juniors.
Cirelli started his junior career with the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League. Cirelli went undrafted in the OHL draft, and would end up making the team as a walk-on. Cirelli scored the game-winning goal in overtime against the Kelowna Rockets in the 2015 Memorial Cup. On June 27, 2015, the Tampa Bay Lightning selected Cirelli 72nd overall in the 3rd round of the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. On January 28, 2016, Cirelli was named as captain of the Generals. On May 19, 2016, the Lightning signed Cirelli to a three-year entry level contract.
On January 9, 2017, Cirelli was traded by the Oshawa Generals to the Erie Otters. Cirelli scored another championship clinching goal in overtime, the 2017 J. Ross Robertson Cup winning goal for the Otters in Game 5 of the OHL championship series against the Mississauga Steelheads . However, the Otters would ultimately fall in the championship game of the 2017 Memorial Cup tournament to the host Windsor Spitfires.
Professional.
On March 1, 2018, Cirelli was recalled by the Tampa Bay Lightning from the Syracuse Crunch of the American Hockey League. Prior to his recall Cirelli was enjoying a productive rookie season with the Crunch. He had appeared in 51 games where he had 14-goals and 37 points. Cirelli would make his NHL debut that night against the Dallas Stars at American Airlines Center. Cirelli recorded his first career NHL goal and assist in the game, which resulted in a 5–4 overtime win. Cirelli also became only the fourth player in Lightning history to have a multiple point game in their NHL debut. On April 12, 2018, Cirelli made his NHL Stanley Cup Playoff debut in a 5–2 Lightning victory over the visiting New Jersey Devils. On April 21, 2018, Cirelli recorded his first career playoff assist and point in a 3–1 Lightning series clinching win over the New Jersey Devils. On May 2, 2018, he recorded his first career playoff goal in a 4–1 win over the Boston Bruins. Building on his impressive overtime goal-scoring resume from his junior days, on September 17, 2020, he scored the winning goal in overtime of Game 6 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the New York Islanders.
On December 24, 2020, Cirelli signed a three-year, $14.4 million contract with the Lightning.
International play.
On April 29, 2019, Cirelli was selected to make his full international debut after he was named to the Team Canada roster for the 2019 IIHF World Championship, held in Slovakia. He helped Canada progress through to the playoff rounds before losing the final to Finland to finish with the Silver Medal on May 26, 2019.

Chief ethics officer

The Chief Ethics Officer (EO) is a senior ranking individual in an organization. The primary role is to build a strong ethical culture within the organization. In order to perform these responsibilities the chief ethics officer must be given support, independence, and opportunity to influence key decision-making board members. The chief ethics officer normally reports to the chief executive officer, and have some access to the board of directors.
The role.
Chief Ethics Officer role was redefined in 1991 for businesses, when Congress passed the Federal Guidelines for Organization (FSCO). Before 1991 this role existed in the financial services and the health care industry without much influence. Because of the rash of accounting scandals such as the Enron scandal, the need for chief ethics officers has increased tremendously. The role of chief ethics officers has increased since the passage of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOA), and amendments of the U.S. Federal Sentencing Guidelines (FSCO). The role of Chief Ethics Officer is no longer a figure head position.
In 2002, after congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Act and the Consumer Protection Act, the chief ethics officer's responsibilities expanded. The role both expanded and became more specific. The chief ethics officer is responsible for developing and distributing codes of ethics, developing training programs for employees, and monitoring and auditing compliance with government regulations. The chief ethics officer may also administer punishments for violation of ethical codes of conduct.
Price ethics.
The primary objective of pricing ethics is to prevent the establishment of monopolies, inequitable pricing practices, and reduce or restrict competition. Such laws are some times called pro-competitive legislation, which were enacted to encourage competition, and prevent activities that restrain trade.
The following are some of the acts passed by Congress, to help prevent unethical practices by businesses to manipulate prices in order to monopolize their industries, such as the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which prohibits organizations from holding monopolies in their industry, the Robinson–Patman Act of 1936, which bans price discrimination between retailers and wholesalers, and the Consumer Goods Pricing Acts of 1975, which prohibits price maintenance agreements among manufactures and resellers in interstate commerce.
Organizational ethics.
Organizational ethics is the ethics of an organization, and it is how an organization responds to an internal or external issue. Organizational ethics is independent of the organizational culture. Organizational culture tends to display the same ethical views of the surrounding community. To reinforce positive views of the community, certain businesses give incentives to both employees and the community. Business organizations give to community by granting scholarships, funds and resources. Employees also give back to the community by contributing their time, gifts and talents. When the local residents obtain the skills from skilled employees then these individuals can apply and fulfill critical skills shortages needed by the organization. When the incentive value method represent the community in a positive way everyone wins, such as the business organization, and the community.
Ethics in business communication.
Ethical communication is a must for a businesses to have a long and successful future. A business cannot act unethically when dealing with its customers, employees or other businesses. Unethical communication consist of false or misleading information, which is a violation of the Federal Trade Communication. Other unethical means of marketing material, is by fraud, scams, and e-mail, or text messaging unsolicited marketing material (SPAM).

Shirkers

Shirkers is a 2018 British-American documentary film by Singapore-born filmmaker Sandi Tan about the making of an independent thriller featuring a teenage assassin set in Singapore. It premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival in January and won the World Cinema Documentary Directing Award, making her the second Singapore-born filmmaker after Kirsten Tan ("Pop Aye", 2017) to win an award at the festival. It was also nominated for the Gotham Independent Film Award for Best Documentary.
"Shirkers" was released on October 26, 2018, on Netflix.
Synopsis.
In the summer of 1992, 19-year-old Sandi Tan, alongside friends Jasmine Ng and Sophia Siddique, as well as film teacher and mentor Georges Cardona, shot the independent film "Shirkers" in Singapore. After wrapping, Tan, Ng, and Siddique left the footage with Cardona as the trio went to study abroad for college. However, Cardona disappeared with the footage and the trio never saw or heard from him again.
On September 11, 2011, four years after Cardona's death in 2007, Cardona's ex-wife emailed Tan, informing her that she was in possession of the footage for "Shirkers", minus the audio tracks. In the proceeding years, Tan decided to digitize the footage and use it to make something new - a documentary about the process of lensing the 1992 Super 8 film stock.
Interviews were conducted in 2015 with Tan's friends, people involved with the making of "Shirkers", and people who knew Cardona. The interviewees were Sophia Siddique Harvey, Jasmine Ng, Sharon Siddique, Philip Cheah, Ben Harrison, Foo Fung Liang, Pohshon Choy, Tay Yek Keak, Grace Dane Mazur, Stephen Tyler, and Georges Cardona's ex-wife.
Georges Cardona.
Around 1976 in New Orleans, Georges Cardona, a John F. Kennedy High School attendee, photography mentor to David Duke, and Vietnam War veteran, opened "Lighthouse Media Center" (a franchisee of Cambridge, Massachusetts-based "Super-8 Sound", a retrofitter of Beaulieu Super 8 film cameras). Cardona was the cinematographer for some of David Duke's electoral campaign commercials and, in New Orleans in 1988, for Stephen Tyler's "The Last Slumber Party".
Reception.
Critical reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.37/10. The site's consensus reads: ""Shirkers" uses one woman's interrogation of a pivotal personal disappointment to offer affecting observations on creativity, lost opportunity, and coming to terms with the past". On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 20 critics, indicating "universal acclaim"; it is labeled as a "Metacritic must-see".
Citing the film as one of his favorites at Sundance, Nick Allen of "RogerEbert.com" wrote a rave review for "Shirkers", saying that "Tan presents her multifaceted life story—vibrant, unbelievable, and full of such incredible women—as a dazzling tapestry that’s unlike many narrative or documentary films."

Pfandherr

In German nobility, a Pfandherr (Pledge Lord) was a creditor, mostly of the lower nobility ("Niederer Adel"), who lent money to a noble higher in the feudal hierarchy, and as security received the usage of a territory belonging to the debtor, which was then known as a "Pfandherrschaft" (pledge lordship). The use usually included all the rights and revenues of the owner, such as taxes, duties, forest exploitation, hunting and fishing rights, etc. The pledged territory remained the possession of the original owner and could be redeemed by termination of the pledge contract and refund of the borrowed money, usually with interest. Since the socially superior debtor feudal lord or prince was much more powerful, it also happened that, for lack of money, only part of the deposit was repaid or the debt was settled in installments.

Québec debout

Québec debout, sometimes styled Québec Debout ( Stand Up, Quebec or Rise Up, Quebec), formerly the Groupe parlementaire québécois () was a Quebec-based parliamentary group in the House of Commons of Canada during the 42nd Canadian Parliament which consisted of members who resigned from the Bloc Québécois caucus. The group did not have a formal leader, but Rhéal Fortin acted as the party's spokesperson. The group was dissolved on September 17, 2018 with all remaining Québec debout MPs rejoining the Bloc Québécois caucus.
Formation of the Groupe parlementaire québécois.
The Groupe parlementaire québécois (GPQ) was formed on February 28, 2018 by seven Members of Parliament (MPs) who resigned from the caucus of the Bloc Québécois (BQ) due to their opposition to the leadership of Martine Ouellet, as well as political differences with her strategy of emphasizing the party's stance regarding active advocacy for Quebec sovereignty rather than a pragmatic approach that focuses on the practical interests of Quebec.
While the seven MPs left the BQ parliamentary caucus, they initially remained members of the BQ party itself and had expressed the desire to remain so. The BQ party executive, in a meeting one week after the group's formation, ruled that the seven defecting MPs would not be expelled from the party for leaving the caucus, and would be allowed to rejoin the caucus in the future.
Québec debout, proposed new party.
On May 1, 2018, the seven MPs announced that they were severing all ties with the BQ and considering founding a new political party. The GPQ members announced on May 9, 2018 that their new party would be registered under the name "Québec debout" and would no longer include Quebec sovereignty in its platform.
Following Ouellet's decision to resign after losing a leadership review, Terrebonne MP Michel Boudrias and Mirabel MP Simon Marcil announced that they would rejoin the Bloc Québécois caucus. The same day, citing the Bloc's vote to focus exclusively on Quebec sovereignty, Québec debout spokesman Rhéal Fortin announced that he and the party's other four MPs would not rejoin the Bloc Québécois.
The five Groupe parlementaire québécois MPs were formally redesignated as Québec debout MPs in the House of Commons on June 6, 2018. On September 17, 2018, they rejoined the Bloc Québécois caucus.

Psalmopoeus victori

Psalmopoeus victori, the Mexican half &amp; half or Darth Maul tarantula, is a species of tarantula endemic to the moist forests of Veracruz, Mexico, although the exact location is withheld to protect from illegal collection.
Description.
This species is easily distinguished from other members of the genus "Psalmopoeus" by it unique coloration, that is having vibrant red on the backside (abdomen and legs III &amp; IV) and dark coloration on the front legs, along with a green carapace, females reach roughly 6.5 inches by diagonal leg span. "P. victori" is sexually dimorphic, with males appearing much more slender, legs matching the green coloration of the carapace, and red abdomen. Like other species in the genus "Psalmopoeus", the species lacks urticating hairs. This species is extremely reclusive, when searching at night, the time tarantulas are most active, it can still prove difficult to observe any specimen. When they are found, it is usually in tree cavities at a medium height.
Etymology.
The specific name is a patronym in honor of Víctor H. Jiménez Arcos, a Mexican herpetologist who saw and collected the first specimen of the species.

Teresita Fortín

Teresa Victoria Fortín Franco (November 17, 1885 – January 19, 1982) was a Honduran painter.
Born in Yuscarán, into a middle class family, Fortín was descended from a family of Creole miners of French origin. She evinced artistic talent from a young age, but was unable to pursue a career in the arts due to her gender. Instead she traveled to Tegucigalpa, where she studied at the School for Young Ladies run by Concha Maldonado. During the 1920s she worked as a teacher at the primary school in Valle de Ángeles. A serious illness in 1930 forced her retirement, and she took up drawing and oil painting as a hobby. She exhibited work at the National Library of Honduras in 1933, under the auspices of the Secretariat of Education, receiving as a result private lessons with Maximiliano Ramírez Euceda. When Alejandro del Vecchio was hired by Archbishop Agustín Hombach to restore the decorative scheme of Tegucigalpa Cathedral she was hired as his assistant, developing as a result an interest in religious painting. She also took an interest in the work of Pablo Zelaya Sierra. Fortín was hired by Carlos Zúñiga Figueroa to teach at his art academy at its foundation in 1932.
During her career she worked with the Carnegie Foundation, assisting in its excavation and restoration of the archaeological site at Copán in 1938. She continued to show work both in solo exhibitions and in group shows. In 1976 she presented a cycle of autobiographical paintings depicting various moments in her life. She received the Pablo Zelaya Sierra Prize for her work in 1980.
Fortín died in Tegucigalpa.

St Martin's Church (Split)

St. Martin's Church () is a Roman Catholic church in Split, Croatia. Built into a small space (an early guardhouse) within the ancient Golden Gate of Diocletian's northern wall, it is one of the oldest churches in the city. St. Martin's Church is one of Split's tourist attractions and is known for its fine 11th century chancel screen. It is currently in the care of the Dominican sisters, who have a monastery next door. The church itself is open to the public to visit.
History.
St. Martin's is located in a cavity of the west wall above the Porta Aurea of Diocletian's Palace. That space, in the time of Diocletian (285-305), was a narrow corridor (1.64 meters wide by 10 meters long) that was used as a guardhouse, with the windows (now filled in) on the south side for surveillance of approach to the main gate into the complex. These windows remain well preserved to the present day in their original form, while windows on the north side date from the city's defense against the Ottoman Turks in the 15th century. The space was converted into the church some time in the 6th century when the complex saw an influx of refugees from outlying communities. Similar churches exist/existed over the Silver Gate, Iron Gate, and the Bronze Gate. 
An inscription along the architrave of the entrance door: 
&lt;poem&gt;
REX BENEDICTE D(EU)S, LAUDIS DECUS IMPERI V(IRTUS)Q(UE.
(H)ANC (ECCLESIAM) CONSTITUIT SUB (H)ONORE(M) BEATI MARTINI
(H)UMIL(I)TE(R) (HA)EC ATQ(UE) POTE(N)S P(RES)B(Y)T(E)R DOMINICUS.
SALVE PA(TER)...T TIBI P(ER) N(OST)RI PECTORIS ANTRA COLI.
&lt;/poem&gt;
Translated by archaeologist Frane Bulić, it reads: 
In identifying Dominic, Bulić dated the inscription to the ninth century and the region of Trpimir I. It seems the (knez) chaplain Dominic renovated the former guardhouse into the first Christian church in the city dedicated to the Virgin Mary, Saint Gregory I and St. Martin of Tours (the father of western monasticism). 
On 4 March 852 Trpimir issued a charter in Biaći ("in loco Byaci dicitur") in the Latin language, confirming Mislav's donations to the Archbishopric in Split. The charter is preserved in a copy from 1568. In this document, Trpimir named himself "by the mercy of God, Duke of the Croats" () and his realm as the "Realm of the Croats" ("Regnum Chroatorum"). The term "regnum" was used by other rulers of that time as a sign of their independence and did not necessarily mean a kingdom. The charter documents Trpimir's decision to build a church (possibly St Martin's) and the first Benedictine monastery in Rižinice, thus bringing the Benedictins into Croatia.
On the architrave, together with his own name, Trpimir also had the name of his other chaplain (also called Martin). The Main altar too dates from the 9th century. The church later provided certain amenities such as a settlement for Dominican sisters (which dates as far back as the 14th century). Bulić, following his discoveries of 1890 and study of the palace, recommended its renovation. On that occasion, the new altar and nave were built. In 1929, during the enlargement of one of the windows, a tablet was discovered with an engraved inscription: "The unworthy servant, priest Dominic, chaplain of Duke Trpimir". Bulić believed that this might represent the gravestone of Dominic. Today it is kept in the Archaeological Museum.
Above the church, a pre-Romanesque bell tower was erected, which was later demolished in the 19th century (similar to the church bell tower of Our Lady of Zvonik above the Iron Gate, which has been preserved to date).
Architecture.
The northern gate of the Palace had been conceived as the main entrance and so it had been elaborately decorated with statues of Emperor Diocletian and his co-regent Maximian, in the upper row of the niches, the a–nd with sculpture of an eagle (a symbol of Jupiter), between the two. There were the statues of their two successors to the throne – Caesars Galerius and Constantine – in the lower row of the niches. This conclusion can be made on account of the imperial iconography pattern, effective at the time of tetrarchy (rule by four persons). On the top of the wall, there have been four pedestals preserved until the present day (while there were five of them on the drawings from the 18th century), that could have been used as a supporting base for statues, but it is unlikely to believe that the imperial figures would have been repeated twice on the same façade. So far there has not been a credible explanation given for this double usage. This could be concluded by the presence of patron saints, (later added) to whom the other gates of the Imperial Palace had been dedicated: St. Theodore (The Western Gate), St Apollinaris (The Eastern Gate) and St. Julian (The Southern Gate). St. Martin (patron saint of soldiers), like St. Theodore, was venerated in the later Roman period, particularly in the West, during the rule of the Emperor Justinian (527-565).
The altar screen divides the church into two parts. The screen is made of marble and covered in vines, grape vines and griffon. On the altar wall, the only one preserved in situ in Dalmatia, there is an inscription with the dedication to patronage the Virgin Mary, St. Gregory the Pope and Blessed Martin.
The Byzantine stage, probably built in the 9th century, belongs to the barrel vault, with an altar in the apse with a carved cross of early Christian denominations and a small trance, set in the middle of large, buried antique openings on the southern wall. The later Byzantine stage of the 11th century belongs to the altarpiece and the bell tower, which was later destroyed.

Zhu Bian

Zhu Bian (1085–1144), courtesy name Shaozhang, was a Song dynasty diplomat, poet, and writer who was detained by the Jurchen Jin dynasty for 15 years, during which he authored "Quwei Jiuwen".
Zhu Bian's brother Zhu Sen () was the grandfather of Zhu Xi.
Early life.
Zhu Bian was from Wuyuan in She Prefecture. He was an avid reader in his childhood. At the age of 19, he enrolled in the "Taixue" (Imperial University), where he impressed Chao Yuezhi with his poetry. Thereafter, he followed Chao Yuezhi to Xinzheng in Zheng Prefecture and married Chao Yuezhi's niece there. Sandwiched between the national capital or "Eastern Capital" Kaifeng and the "Western Capital" Luoyang (known as Henan Prefecture), Xinzheng abounded in families with great lineages and learning. Zhu Bian enjoyed his life there and deepened considerably his knowledge.
Zhu Bian's happy life came to an end in November 1125 when the Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty army attacked the Song from the north, quickly approaching Kaifeng, eventually capturing both Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong in March 1127 in what is known as the Jingkang incident. Zhu Bian fled to the South with the Song imperial court but his wife was killed by Jin soldiers.
As hostage in Jin.
After Emperor Gaozong reestablished the Song dynasty in Hang Prefecture in May 1127, he called for a diplomatic mission to Jin to visit Emperor Qinzong and Emperor Huizong in 1128. Zhu Bian volunteered to go and was named the Communication Vice-Commissioner (), assisting the Communication Commissioner Wang Lun (). Because he held no office, Zhu Bian also received several nominal titles before his trip. Once they arrived in the Jin territory of Yunzhong Prefecture (雲中, modern Datong) in 1130, the Jurchen general Wanyan Zonghan put them under house arrest and would not hear of their requests.
In 1132, the Jurchens told Wang Lun and Zhu Bian that they were willing to negotiate towards a treaty, and that one of them could return to Song with a letter. Zhu Bian told Wang Lun that he would stay behind: "When I came, I was already prepared to die." He told Wang Lun to return and work towards the treaty, and asked Wang Lun to leave the imperial seal with him. It is said that Zhu Bian kept the seal with him at all times, including in his sleep. The Jurchens wanted Zhu Bian to serve under Liu Yu (), a puppet emperor installed by them to govern the Central Plain, but Zhu called Liu Yu a "national traitor" and said he would rather die than serve him. The Jurchens starved him for a time, but Zhu would not submit. Later the Jurchens stopped coercing him, but Zhu was convinced that one way or another he would die in the North. Once, when he dined with a few captured scholar-officials from the Song, Zhu asked them to bury him when he died: "I will be grateful if you could inscribe the words 'The Grave of Zhu, Song's Communication Vice-Commissioner' on my tombstone." The others all had tears in their eyes, but Zhu continued talking and laughing.
Later life.
Zhu Bian finally returned to his country in 1143 when an agreement was reached between the Jin and the Song. Back in Lin'an, he entered the palace to thank Emperor Gaozong of Song and advised him to be always wary and prepared to war with Jin. The emperor wanted to confer him titles, but Zhu didn't receive them due to strong oppositions from the treacherous chief councilor Qin Hui. He died a year later.

Pelham Bay Naval Training Station

Pelham Bay Naval Training Station was a WWI era US Navy training facility located in Pelham Bay Park's Rodman's Neck in the Bronx. Located near City Island, and Westchester county, it was operational from 1917 to 1919.
History.
Prior to the creation of the Pelham Bay Naval Training Station, a national guard base was set up in the heart of Pelham Bay Park. 
The 280 acre site was designed by the architectural firm of Ewing &amp; Allen and included a ninety acre hospital.
The camp also featured entertainment facilities provided by the Knights of Columbus, the Y.M.C.A., and other organizations including the American Red Cross and the American Library Association.
Curriculum.
The camp offered a number of sequential training courses, with mastery of a given course being required to advance to the next one.
Influenza pandemic of 1918.
The camp suffered from the Influenza pandemic of 1918 from late September 21 through late October 21, 1918, and again in December 1918. There were 2,399 cases of influenza, with a total of 145 deaths.

Ben Walsh

Benjamin Walsh (born July 4th, 1979) is an American politician currently serving as the 54th Mayor of Syracuse, NY. Walsh assumed office on January 1, 2018 as the first independent mayor of Syracuse and the second without major party support since Louis Will in 1913. 
Early life and education.
Walsh is the son of former congressman James T. Walsh and grandson of former congressman and mayor of Syracuse, NY, William F. Walsh, both of whom represented Central New York as Republicans.
Walsh grew up as one of three children in the Strathmore neighborhood. He graduated from Westhill High School in 1997. Walsh attended Ithaca College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science. He also went on to attend Syracuse University, where he received a Master’s degree in Public Administration from the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs.
Career.
Walsh began his policy career working for Laborers Local 633, working on construction jobs around Onondaga Lake after his graduation from Ithaca College. Following this, he worked for the political actions staff for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations in Albany. In 2002, Walsh returned to Syracuse to run his fathers congressional campaign. Following his father’s campaign, Walsh traveled to Ireland, where he stayed for three months and interned for the Prime Minister of Ireland at the time, Bertie Ahern. 
Walsh eventually returned to Syracuse to work at SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry educating municipalities about brownfields. He went on to become the deputy commissioner of the city's Department of Neighborhood and Business Development under previous mayor Stephanie Miner. Here, Walsh created the Greater Syracuse Land Bank and was part of the redevelopment of Hotel Syracuse. He also worked on the Metropolitan Development Association, a precursor to CenterState CEO. Additionally, Walsh served on several boards and community groups around Syracuse, including serving as president of the Gifford Foundation board. 
After resigning from his position at city hall in 2015, Walsh worked for Mackenzie Hughes law firm as Business Development Director, prior to launching his campaign to become the mayor of Syracuse.
Mayor of Syracuse.
Walsh was elected Mayor of Syracuse, NY in 2017 while running on two minor party lines, the Independence Party of New York and Reform Party of New York State. In what was generally seen as an upset, Ben Walsh defeated Democratic Party frontrunner Juanita Perez Williams. He won the election with 54% of the vote in what was a five candidate race, involving candidates from both major parties as well as the Green and Working Families Party.
Policy Plans.
In January of 2019 Walsh introduced his major policy plan, Syracuse Surge, at that year's State of the City. The goal of this plan is to modernize Syracuse’s economy and prepare it for equitable access to new technology (as anticipated in projections in the Fourth Industrial Revolution) through both public and private investment.
The mayor's plans have included establishing a science, technology, engineering, arts and math (STEAM) school at the old Central Technical High School and is expected to open in the Fall of 2022.
In January of 2020 Walsh announced the Resurgent Neighborhood Initiative (RNI), a plan for housing and economic development focused on ten neighborhoods and business corridors throughout the City of Syracuse.  The RNI plan is expected to add 200 new units of affordable housing to the city.  Despite the negative impact of the pandemic, progress on the program has continued. 
Police Reform.
Police Reform has been a crucial part of Mayor Walsh Syracuse Police Reform Executive Order. This executive order includes the enacting of the Right to Know law which requires officers to give their name, rank and reason for stopping someone during every interaction with the public. The officers are required to leave their information if no arrest is made. Additionally the executive order includes equipping each patrol car with a dashboard camera, securing more body-worn cameras for patrol officers and new training guidelines such as education on the history of racism in Syracuse and the United States, among other things.
Attracting Public and Private Investment to Syracuse.
The city of Syracuse was awarded a $500,000 grant in the beginning of 2019 by the New York Power Authority to buy and replace all of the city’s streetlights with energy efficient light bulbs. The Walsh Administration claims the purchase is estimated to save the city $3 million per year and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6,100 tons.
On April 18, 2019, JP Morgan Chase selected Syracuse as one of five winners of its inaugural Advancing Cities Challenge, the city of Syracuse was awarded $3 million. This money is for improving tech sector jobs and not-for-profits in low or middle income neighborhoods with the overall goal of training young people, veterans, and people of color for future careers.
In April, 2021, Amazon donated $1.75 million to the STEAM school at Central Tech in order to further increase access to tech education in the city.
Relocation of Christopher Columbus Statue.
In 2020, after two years of community dialog, Mayor Walsh announced plans to remove and relocate the statue of Christopher Columbus from Syracuse's Columbus Circle. In addition, the circle will be renamed and become a heritage site. An educational component will be added to the site outlining the impacts of colonialism. The statue has been the subject of controversy for years.

Callio

Callio is a project to oversee the reuse of the Pyhäsalmi Mine, located in the town of Pyhäjärvi in Finland. Callio aims to make Pyhäsalmi Mine an operating environment for businesses and an underground research facility.
Callio is a joint project by the town of Pyhäjärvi and the University of Oulu. In 2017 the facility joined the "Baltic Sea Underground Facilities and Innovation Network" (BSUIN).
The word ”callio” is an anglicised version of the Finnish word ”kallio” [kael-lee-oh], meaning crystalline bedrock.
Facilities and access.
Callio is an umbrella organization for a variety of non-mining activities in and around the mine. Of these, Callio Lab oversees scientific research and development. Proposed new activities include a secure underground data center, pumped hydroelectrical energy storage, plant and fungus growing laboratories, breeding sites for insects and fish, and several other types of underground businesses.
As of 2018, there are four environmentally controlled laboratories in Callio. Listed top-to-bottom, they are:
The ambient temperature within the mine depends on the depth but is otherwise constant. At the Lab 4 (660 m) level it is 15 °C (59 °F) and at Lab 2 (1430 m) level 28 °C (82 °F).
Currently (2018) the mine harbors two scientific experiments: C14 liquid scintillator and EMMA, operated by CUPP, University of Oulu and University of Jyväskylä.
Access.
The "main level" of the mine is at 1400 meters depth, and is equipped with service and social facilities, e.g., a restaurant and the deepest sauna in the world. Accessing the main level from the surface takes just 3 minutes using the elevator (average speed 8 m/s, maximum 12 m/s). The same descent takes about 30 minutes by car, along the 11 km long decline access tunnel.
Activities.
Recently the mine has opened up for a variety of cultural activities. It has hosted the deepest concert in the world (by Agonizer at 1271 m ) as well as dance performances. The 11 km long spiral-shaped main tunnel has also seen several uphill running and cycling competitions.
Public sporting events.
Callio Extreme Run was held 19.5.2018 with over 50 participants treading the whole 11 km from the main level at 1410 meters underground to the top via the main access tunnel. The mine tunnel network consists of hundreds of kilometers of tunnel, so for the safety of the participants all other intersections and pathways were cordoned off. Participants ranged from ultra-endurance athletes and triathletes to regular exercisers. Adding to the challenge was the environmental conditions, as the run was constant uphill, the temperature over 23 °C and humidity varying between levels of 50%-100%. Runners all had to wear safety helmets fashioned with headlights. The men's professional series was won by Tino Tiilikainen, a member of the Vuokatti SkiTeam, beating the previous record held by Sami Jauhojärvi, with a time of 1:05:56. The women's professional series was won by Maija Oravamäki with a time of 1:17:27.
Strongman Championships League Callio World Record Breakers competition was organized by Callio at Pyhäsalmi Mine on 7.9.2019. The competition was a part of the Strongman Champions League- circuit which has a total of 16 grand prix competition a year. The event was open to the public and televised as 12 strongmen from several countries participated in six events held on the mine mill grounds, as well as underground on the main level and in the open rock pit. 3 new world records were set in the farmerswalk, conan wheel, and deadlift categories by Aivars Smaukstelis, Antti Mourujärvi and Dainis Zageris.
Film productions.
Callio was also facilitating the use of Pyhäsalmi Mine as a filming location for the new sci-fi television series "White Wall", with a cast led by Aksel Hennie, Vera Vitali and Eero Milonoff. It is a Finnish-Swedish collaboration between Yle and SVT that was premiered in 2020 and is the most expensive Finnish television series made, with a 900 000 euro budget per episode. The mine served as one location for filming, with sets both above and below ground, where a special film set was built 660 meters underground in abandoned storage tunnels. Filming in Pyhäsalmi took place between November 2018 and April 2019 with a film crew of 50 people. Most of the extras required were locals and even miners themselves.
Other productions have also taken note of the unique location and in October 2019 the film "Hiidenkirnu: Giants Kettle" will film scenes at the mine. The film is produced by Markku Hakala and is set in the 1970s and is described as a mystical story about a woman, a man and a giant trapped in a barn.
Recognitions.
Callio Pyhäjärvi was awarded the National Energy Globe Award Finland 2019 for its concept on pumped hydroelectrical energy. The Energy Globe Award recognizes projects oriented in conservation of energy and utilization of renewable resources in 187 participating countries. The national winners will participate and compete for the World Energy Globe Award, with the ceremony taking place 12–13 November in Espoo, Finland to mark the awards 20th jubilee. The location was chosen as Espoo, because it was elected the most sustainable city in the world by United Nations in 2018.
Research projects.
Callio Lab.
One major project Callio pioneered is the scientifically oriented Callio Lab. Callio Lab is a multidisciplinary R&amp;D environment aiming to utilize better the unique infrastructure and facilities of the Pyhäsalmi Mine. The underground environment has numerous possibilities for research and experimentation in fields of physics, geosciences, underground construction, microbiology, food production, and life sciences. Callio Lab aims to bring new users to the mine and facilitate the beginning of new projects. Open call is continuous and new experiments or research plans can be proposed on their website. Callio Lab's workers assist new operators in getting started, this includes providing information, safety training and transportation in the mine as well as working as a liaison between them and the mine personnel. Callio Lab is a member of the BSUIN network, which consists of underground laboratories and facilities in the Baltic region.
Callio Lab's largest underground laboratory, Lab 2, was previously the prime candidate for the LAGUNA project, which fell through due to funding issues. LAGUNA is a proposed very large volume underground neutrino observatory, designed to study e.g., the excess of matter over antimatter in the universe. Pyhäsalmi mine would have been at the optimal distance from the CERN particle accelerators, which would have provided the neutrino beams for the experiment.
Callio Edible Insects from Mine.
Callio Edible Insects from Mine project is piloting underground insect production and is a two year project beginning in December 2018. It is a joint collaboration between the following entities: city of Pyhäjärvi, Pyhäsalmi Mine Oy, Entocube Oy, Probot Oy, M-Solutions Oy, Muon Solutions Oy and Callio Pyhäjärvi. The aim is to build an ecological and efficient product plant. Principle characteristics of this type of production are remote control and -supervision and circular economy. Applications of technologies encompassing these characteristics can be found in subterranean living and space habitats. The tunnels of Pyhäsalmi Mine bear a resemblance to the conditions of pressurized lava tunnels in Mars and as such provide a good environment to test out such innovations. The project will also compare the differences in production above ground and underground. In July 2019 the first insect farm was built in lab 2 at 1430 meters underground. The first species grown there is house crickets (Acheta domesticus) and the first generation has been successfully harvested. Due to the location of the farm, heating expenses are eliminated because the geothermal energy keeps the temperature at a constant 25 degrees. The crickets produced during the project cannot be sold because of legislation, but have been made into product samples.
Plant Production in Mine.
Plant Production in Mine was a project and study conducted by the Natural Resources Institute of Finland (LUKE) in Callio Lab laboratories at 660 meters underground. The goal of the project was to study how plant production can be implemented in a controlled underground environment. The experiment began with growing common hop (Humulus lupulus) in April 2018 using hydroponic technology. Fertilization, watering, air ventilation and temperature was controlled through automation and remote control. If optimal growing conditions can be characterized, this would broach the possibility of year round production of hops with hundreds of harvests instead of just one. This could have the potential of replacing foreign imported hops for national breweries. Other plants that have been grown in the labs are potato, woad, and common nettle.
Intelligent Lighting.
The Intelligent Lighting pilot study conducted at Pyhäsalmi Mine is studying the effects of artificial light in an underground working environment. The main area of study is the facilities at the main level, particularly the office spaces. The environment is naturally devoid of natural light and the lighting is constant 24/7. How this affects the workers physiologically and psychologically was studied through physiological measurements and interviews. In October 2019 the office spaces were fitted with intelligent adaptive lighting programmed to each user's individual needs. This will be followed by a study period to see whether these intelligent lighting solutions based on architectural lighting principles promote the employees well-being. The study is conducted by researchers from the University of Oulu
MINETRAIN.
The MINETRAIN project is coordinated by the Oulu Mining School and aims to create a thorough training program for professionals in the mining industry. At the same time experience is gained from whether a mine heading toward closure could be transformed into a state of the art training center. The approach of the program is holistic, providing attendees with training spanning the whole life cycle of a mine. The Pyhäsalmi Mine is especially well equipped for this, because it encompasses all aspects of mining from excavation to mill processing. The program provides lectures as well as hands on learning opportunities and can be tailored to suit the participants previous experience. The project is funded by EIT Raw Materials. The first course was held in August 2019 with a class of 15 international professionals. The project leaders believe that through immersive training programs such as these, future mining operations can become more efficient and sustainable. They help the industry gain more knowledge and adopt a holistic point of view towards production and planning.
Energy Mine.
The EAKR funded project Energy Mine began in February 2017 and will run until 2020. It is studying what the geothermal energy potential of Pyhäsalmi Mine is and whether it can be harnessed in a financially profitable way. The project aims to ascertain what technologies and applications could be applied in this field of study both from a scientific and economic point of view. Other supporters of this project include Pyhäsalmi Mine and the city of Pyhäjärvi.
Underground Rescue.
Callio is hosting the Callio Underground Rescue- project. The Pyhäsalmi mine will be the site of Finland's first underground fire-, rescue- and safety training center. The project secured funding for 2019 through 2022 and the projected cost is 739000 euros. 70% of this came from the EAKR fund. As of now, the closest training center of this type is in Norway. The project aims to utilize the soon to be closed mine and its already existing facilities and infrastructure. The main coordinator is the city of Pyhäjärvi with numerous professional partners and businesses, that specialize in fire extinction and safety systems, ICT solutions, and tunnel- and shaft rescue operations. These partners include Pyhäsalmi Mine Oy, Agnico Eagle Finland Oy, Sotkamo Silver AB, Anglo American Sakatti Mining Oy, J&amp;T Technology Oy, M-Solutions Oy and Posiva Oy.
Pumped Hydroelectric Storage Facility.
It was announced on December 4, 2019 that Pumped Hydro Storage Sweden AB and Callio have signed a co-operation agreement to build a demo model of a pumped hydroelectric energy storage facility in the Pyhäsalmi Mine. The purpose of this co-operation is to design and develop on a smaller scale a pilot facility which can later be implemented in a full-scale version. Work is already underway, including the technical plans, timetables, and financing of the project.
This is the first phase of Callio's plans for a pumped hydroelectric storage facility in Pyhäsalmi Mine. Once the creation, testing and optimizing it this demo facility for use is completed, Callio will move to phase two. Phase two aims to negotiate the fulfillment of a full-scale 75MW facility.
The Pyhäsalmi Mine.
The overall depth of the Pyhäsalmi mine is 1450 m (4760 ft), making it the deepest base metal mine in Europe. Its main metals are copper and zinc.
The mine was opened in 1962 by Outokumpu, sold to Inmet mining in 2002, and obtained by First Quantum Minerals in 2013. The mine was previously planned to close by the end of 2019, but has been granted approximately 14 months more of mining activity due to an increase in demand for pyrite from Yara in Siilinjärvi. Pyrite is a by product of copper and zinc mining. As of now, mining is going to be continued until spring 2021. Above-ground refinery will continue until 2025.
The mine safety has improved significantly over the last decades, and the underground mine has become a test bed for new (often award-winning) access control, monitoring and automation technology. Underground accidents in Pyhäsalmi are very rare, and the last fatality occurred in 1995. Several easily contained on-ground refinery fires have however occurred at the site during the 2000s. In 2012, explosives contaminated with pyrite ore were sent from the Pyhäsalmi mine for destruction at the Forcit ammunition factory in Vihtavuori, where (after a year in storage) the container started to heat up and smoke. The reason for this potentially dangerous situation was revealed to be careless handling and packaging at the mine. This prompted significant changes in the safety protocols, and since 2013 all hazardous waste is destroyed on-site in Pyhäsalmi.

In 1923, the sculptor Jo Davidson had met La Follette in Paris where the Senator had sat for a bust. In his autobiography Davidson records, “The bust that I had done at that time now stood me in good stead. it helped me bring back his warm and dynamic personality…….. La Follette had not particularly like the bust…and had remarked that it was too belligerent. Accordingly, I held back.” The work took Davidson four years to complete and is one of only a handful of statues in the collection that portrays the subject sitting down. Before it was placed in the Capitol the work was exhibited in a gallery in New York for two months.
Davidson's bust of La Follette now resides in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C.

Indrajeet (Sati Sulochana)

Indrajeet (Sati Sulochana) is a 1961 Telugu-language Hindu mythological film, based on the life of Indrajit from the epic Ramayana, produced by S. Rajinikanth, D. V. Subba Rao and Kancharla Madhava Rao under the Srikanth Productions banner and directed by S. Rajinikanth. It stars N. T. Rama Rao, Anjali Devi and music composed by T. V. Raju. Sati Sulochana and Pendli Pilupu were released on the same day, both starred by NTR. This happened for the first time in Indian film history. The film is dubbed into Bengali in 1979 as Meghnad Badh/Vadh
Plot.
The film begins with the birth of Ravana's (S. V. Ranga Rao) son Meghanada when Ravana commands all the nine planets to be constellations in such a position so that he could become a universal hero. But "Shani" disobeys Ravana's order for which he amputates him. Indra (Mikkilineni) learns regarding the bravery of the child; he sends his followers to capture him, but he defeats them and thrown back. Now Meghanada takes a vow to win over Indra, for which he moves to penance to get a boon of immortality. Meghanada (N. T. Rama Rao) performs a huge penance for Lord Brahma, gets a boon to Meghanada that he will die only in the hands of a person who stays awake for 14 years, without taking food &amp; water and he must be a bachelor with the wife. After that, Meganadha declares war against Indra, as he is defeated, he rushes to Nagaloka and takes the protection of Adiseshu. Meghanada follows him where he gets acquainted with Adiseshu's daughter Sulochana (Anjali Devi), both of them fell in love. But Adiseshu did not agree for their alliance, the war begins between them and Adiseshu is defeated where he too takes a vow that he will definitely eliminate him for which even he is ready to take rebirth. Meghanada arrests Indra moves towards Lanka along with Sulochana and throws Indra at the feet of his father. There onwards, Meghanada is called as "Indrajith". Indrajith &amp; Sulochana get married, lived happily for some time after that a dispute arises because she is a disciple of Lord Vishnu, which is not liked by Ravana &amp; Indrajit. So, Indrajit starts harassing her to stop her prayers.
Years roll by, Lord Vishnu (Kanta Rao) takes the avatar of Lord Rama and Adisheshu also borns along with him as Lakshmana (Ramakrishna) to take revenge against Indrajith. Ravana captures Seeta (Rajasri) and keeps her in Lanka. Lord Hanuman, in search of Seeta, reaches Lanka and destroys the "Ashokavanam" where Indrajit arrests him through Bhramaastra. Hanuman burns out Lanka returns to Rama and gives information regarding Seeta. The war begins, one by one, Ravana's soldiers are getting killed by Rama; Indrajith, being a magician, wants to stop Rama and creates an illusion that he has killed Seeta when Rama faints up. Now Lakshmana encounters Indrajith in the battlefield. The first day of the war, Lakshmana was defeated by Indrajith by using "Nagastram" (Snake Bomb), by which he is completely poisoned when Hanuman brings "Sanjeevani" from the Himalayas and saves him. After recovery, Lakshmana finds that Indrajith is performing a "Yaaga" to become immortal so he must be killed before it is completed. On the other side, his wife Sulochana is performing a "Vratham", which is protecting her husband. Lakshmana destroys the "Yaaga", at the same time, Ravana stops Sulochana's prayers, at that moment, Lakshmana decapitates Indrajith. Knowing this, Sulochana bursts out and reaches to the battlefield where she finds her husband's body without a head. But through her devotional power, she gets back her husband's head and completes her "Vratham" after that, both die. Finally, the movie ends with their souls reaching heaven.

Military Police Corps (Indonesia)

The Puspom TNI (Indonesian: "Pusat Polisi Militer Tentara Nasional Indonesia") or Joint Military Police Command of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI) is one of the central executive agencies within the TNI which has the role of administering administrative assistance to the army, navy, and air force as embodiment and guidance through the operation of Military Police functions. Puspom TNI oversees the three military police organizations which are the Army Military Police, Naval Military Police, and Air Force Military Police.
The military police of Indonesia perform duties in the area of law enforcement (including investigation of crime) involving members of the military and may coordinate with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Indonesian National Police (Polri) and/or the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK).
The military police of Indonesia is not considered as a Gendarmerie, as it is only responsible solely to enforce discipline and law and order towards members of the armed forces of all ranks.
Highest position in the Military Police Corps is Provost Marshal of Military Police, a position held by a 2-star general/admiral/marshall from the military police corps of any of each service branch.
History.
Prior to the 4th of May 2015, the military police units was only present within each of the armed forces branches (Army, Navy and Air force). At the TNI headquarters level, the special staff officer (which is held by the army military police commander) was appointed as the main aide and advisor to TNI commander (Panglima TNI) regarding military policing affairs. On 4 May 2015, the commander of the Armed Forces Gen. Moeldoko reorganized the military police units of the three branches, he commanded the special staff officer to be formed as a Military Police Command (Puspom TNI) to improve law and order within all of the three branches within the armed forces. Since then, the Puspom TNI became the highest military police authority organization with the armed forces (TNI) overseeing the military police units of the three branches.
Duties and Tasks.
The main duties and tasks of the Military Police in Indonesia are to conduct:
The duties and tasks mentioned above are to be conducted in/for the scope of the Indonesian National Armed Forces.
In Indonesia, the Military Police does not have authority towards civilians as it is the primary duty of the Indonesian National Police (Polri), and in the other hand, the National Police does not have authority towards active members of the armed forces except accompanied by the Military police. If a serviceman or woman is caught red-handed by the civilian police, then the violator will be sent to the Military Police or the Military police would be informed of it.
The Army, Navy, and Air force have their own Military Police unit which focuses on their own branches, but any Military policemen from either branch can take action towards military members from a different branch if caught red-handed, then the violator will be sent to the Military police of their branch. The Military Police in Indonesia are known locally as "Polisi Militer" sometimes shortened "PM" or "POM".
Executive agencies under the supervision of the Puspom TNI.
Each armed forces branch has its own executive agency regarding military policing affairs, which are as follows:
The Puspom TNI as a centralized-command of the Military Police corps oversees the three military police branches (shown above) as a compound unit within the armed forces organization. The members in the Puspom TNI originates from the three military police corps.
Uniforms.
The uniforms worn by the Military police are different for the three unit branches. The Army Military Police wear dark green, the Navy Military Police wear blue-gray and the Air Force Military Police wear light blue. The beret of the three Military police corps of Indonesia is the same which is blue, dragged to the left with the Military police symbol on the right side when worn. Military policemen are identifiable by their white belts, white lanyards, white helmets, and brassard worn on their upper left sleeve imprinted the word "PM". 
Military policemen have different types of uniforms. The uniform worn during training and operations is the Disruptive Pattern Material camouflage uniform, while during law enforcement duties, the non-camouflage uniform is worn. To distinguish military members between Military policemen when wearing the camouflage uniform can be noticed by the white Aiguillette worn on their uniform, which indicates a member of the Military police.

Andean agriculture

Current agricultural practices of the Andean region of South America typically involve a synthesis of traditional Incan practices and modern techniques to deal with the unique terrain and climatic elements of the area. Millions of farmers in economically impoverished communities make a living producing staple crops such as potato, olluco, and mashua for their own consumption as well as profit in local and urban markets. The Andean region is particularly known for its wide variety of potato species, boasting over about 5,000 varieties identified by the International Potato Center based in Peru. These crops are arranged within the mountains and plateaus of the Andes in four distinct landscape-based units described as Hill, Ox Area, Early Planting, and Valley which overlap one another in a patchwork-styles of plateau surfaces, steep slopes, and wetland patches. Within each of these units, farmers classify soil types as either "puna ("deep soils), "suni" (thin, slope soils) (local names may vary per region).
Andean farmers must contend with the severe fluctuations in temperature, the unpredictability of the rainy season, and a multitude of pest threats on the daily. To cope with such challenges, many farmers try protect their crops by cultivating a diverse array of species rather than a monoculture. Communities engage in many cultural and faith-based practices to ensure a good harvest and season. They highly value ancestral wisdom and call on it often for agricultural and social endeavors. Many farmers still use Incan-style terraces and irrigation systems for cultivation.
Tools and crops.
As one of the major cradles of agriculture, the Andean region, has many indigenous crop species which have persisted and diversified for generations. These crops and tools include:
Tools
Crops
Environmental conditions.
The Andean region holds many extreme and variable environmental conditions that challenge farmers of the region. From pests, frosts, variable rainy seasons, and changes to soil conditions farmers have a lot to contend with. Of these, frosts are considered to hold the largest environmental threat, with pests coming in close second. Some of the most threatening pests include:
Late rainy seasons also usually precipitate a decrease in pond and soil humidity, and increase in soil erosion and fertility.
To combat some of these risks, farmers typically turn to syncretic mixes of traditional and modern practices. For mitigating effects of frosts, farmers utilize Incan-designed terraces which break up the cold air coming down from the mountains. The stones of the terraces also absorb heat during the day, retaining it at night and keeping the soil above frost temperatures. Other benefits include decreased soil erosion, organized irrigation systems, and humidity maintenance. Irrigation systems, besides delivering water in typically arid fields, also keeps some of the warmth accumulated throughout the day and adds an extra layer of protection around younger crops with tender roots. Though these structures work to mitigate some of the threats, others such as pests, hailstorms, heavy rainfall, or severe droughts are less preventable and could destroy the entire harvest in a given season. As a response, many farmers choose to procure seed from further distanced communities to introduce variety to the cultivated crops in a hope that some will be more resilient in the event of a severe environmental concern. Other protective strategies include intercropping, production of livestock manure, regulated slash and burn, and grazing land management
Effects of climate change.
Within the past century, there have been important changes in the climate of the Andean region attributed to climate change. Precipitation has decreased, and due to the Anden region's already arid climate, this decrease in precipitation has led to increasing droughts. Run off from the mountains have also shown relevant decreasing trends in the early part of the last century with increases between 1960-1985. Surface air temperatures of the area have increased 2.8 degrees Celsius marked with various cooling patterns. Though these are general trend of the region, different areas are contending with the changes in a variety of ways from reaching out the ancestors to adopting more modern practices to contend with the shifts and anywhere in between.
Cultural practices.
Farming in the Andean region is a highly collective activity that is deeply enriched by a spiritual reverence of the land (Pacha Mama) who is viewed as a living, breathing entity who must be dealt with respect and dignity. Therefore, people organize many different rituals and ceremonies during the season to pay reverence to her. These rituals may include praying for a good harvest, thanking the Earth for her many blessings, blessing a field before planting, or predicting an environmental threat. All of this is typically done in the native language of Quechua or Quichua (depending on the area). In Quecha, the Andean people call themselves runa cuna loosely translating to people of the land (Pacha Mama). There is a strong sense of belonging within the community which is transmitted through generations as well as an integral idea of mutual help (yanamanchi).
Rituals.
Rituals:
Role of the community.
The community plays a large role in the life of Andean farmers. Much of the farm labor is split among the community especially during harvest time. They also play a role in storing and passing along ancestral knowledge regarding agriculture of the region. Most of the farmers were taught all they needed to know through their families or other kin in the community. There is also reliance on outside communities networks and systems of seed sharing, farm labor delegation, and selling of surplus crops.
Seed procurement and dispersal.
Seed procurement and dispersal are essential components of Andean farmer's lives as it effects their spatial, environmental, and social spheres. In spatial terms, seed procurement affects the physical organization of farmland dictating where specific crops are cultivated. Specific varieties of tubers do well at differing altitudes, thus necessitating spatial planning depending on which species of seeds are available. In environmental terms, seed flow within and between communities has a causal effect on adaptations of specific crop varieties as well the mineral composition of cultivated land. Farmers also make use of locally domesticated species (traditional landraces) as well as highly regulated internationally domesticated species (cultivar strains) depending availability and cost. Lastly, many of the upper Andean communities have strict gender roles which dictate who is responsible for seed procurement withinin the community as well as outside of it. Beside gender roles, there are also complex systems of seed procurement between neighboring communities, with large seed fair being set up in common spaces for easy trade.
Seed management in the Andean region is viewed as a household or community-wide endeavor. Generally speaking, seed are procured from outside of the community during initial stages and sourcing, and self-provisioned during regular seasonal planting. The four distinct landscape styles of Hill, Ox Area, Early Planting, and Valley all cover a broad range of agroecological habitats with varying methods of seed procurement. Within Hill units seeds are largely procured from other the farmer's own household or other local hill units since it spans many different environmental niches. This means that the seeds are grown in, sourced, and dispersed among hill units to other hill units within the area. To add variety as well, a percentage of the seeds are sourced from distanced communities. Within the Ox Area, seeds are also largely procured from farmer's own household as well as from outside units within the community. More so than in Hill units, farmers mix cultivars and traditional land races. These cultivars are purchased through development institutions within nearby urban centers. The Early Planting units are a bit more difficult for seed procurement and cultivation since they have year-round humidity. This kind of humidity is not conducive to seed production, therefore it is not common for seeds to come from the same unit or household. Most of the seeds are procured from other units (i.e. Hill or Ox Area) from neighboring communities, with a large percentage coming from the development institutions which specialize in cultivars.
Gendered dynamics.
The gender dynamics concerning seed procurement within communities typically vary between type of farm unit (Hill, Ox Area, Early Planting, or Valley) and also depend on if trading and purchasing happens within the community, neighboring communities, or outside of the area. Within the Hill unit women and men have similar levels of involvement in extracommunity trading and procurement whereas women who participate in the Ox Area Unit procure the seeds from local sources, while men procure them from outside of the community. On the whole, women are more likely to be involved in procurement within the community, equally likely to be involved within extracommunity procurement, and less likely to procure from development institutions in urban centers.
Effects of the Green Revolution and modernization.
The Green Revolution that occurred between the 1930s and 1960s had lasting impact on the technology and culture of the agricultural world, the Andean region being no exception. With this "revolution" came a widespread use of fertilizers, pesticides, and internationally recognized cultivars which all contributed to emphasis on high-yields from each crop cycle. High-yield monoculture farms often receive financial advantages. These high-yield varieties were first introduced to the Andean region in the early 1950s and can now be found throughout the highlands and even among some of the more remote communities. Some of the countries within the Andean region even offer reduced subsidies to farmers who adopt modern or Green-Revolution style agricultural practices, thus incentivizing this sort of farming. However, when smaller, traditional farms who consume much of their own crop convert to monocultures, they typically see a decrease in financial return as a result of having to spend more money on outside sustenance rather than just from what they can grow within their own fields.
Seed networks.
In post-green revolution practices, farmers are encouraged to adapt their own domesticated strains for the particular environmental unit in which they cultivate. However, this intense localized domestication based on environmental niches is not conducive to the climatic fluctuations of the Andean region, thus why most farmers also rely on extracommunity strains procured through seed fairs and markets within neighboring and distanced communities. This is a traditional practice that ensures that variety is retained within the traditional landraces. Limiting specialization in this case, contrary to the culture of the Green Revolution, produces more variety and higher-yields rather than relying on a single domesticated species, thus creating tensions between the priorities of post-green revolution agriculture and traditional agricultural practices of the region.
Environmental niches.
Practices instilled during the Green Revolution emphasizing high yields also had effects on the landscape of agriculture. In producing high-yield of a single crop, farmers began to cultivate land that would be optimal for a single kind of crop rather than a variety creating monocultures. Within the Andean region, the Ox Area unit typically traverses less environmental niches and is thus better suited for monoculture production as opposed to polyculture. Thus, due to the Green Revolution, the Andean region saw a decreased in cultivated hill fields and an expansion of Ox Area units.
Indirect ecological effects.
Changes in farming unit types within the Andean region has also had indirect effects on downstream ecosystems. Specifically within Colombia, with the expansion of Ox Area units causing deforestation, over 63% of the land cover has been replaced by agriculture indirectly increasing the concentration of NHN in the water as well as sedimentation. The increase in nitrogen is attributed to run off from fertilizers, nitrogen fixing crops, and animal waste. High levels of NHN can be highly toxic to water ecosystems and pose a risk to the biota within these streams.
Conservation efforts.
"In situ" conservation.
Around the end of 1980s early 1990s multiple in situ conservation efforts were initiated. Some of these efforts include cultivating high variation within crops as well as specialized production managements that reflect the specific ecological and environmental floors of the various farm units.
Participatory plant breeding.
Participatory plant breeding is a collaborative process in which farmers, marketers, processors, consumers and policy makers all get a say in the plant breeding program. With this strategy, farmers can input local knowledge of soil and rainfall patterns to account for these factors when cultivating variety breeds. This kind of plant breeding is being instilled in particular areas within the Andean region to combat some of the negative effects of Green Revolution practices. Many of these efforts rely on climate-soil zonation to organize zones of testing. However, in the case of Andean farmers, most farm unit span many different climate-soil zones, and thus methods solely reliant on this zonation are not practical for farmers of the area. Efforts are being made to create Participatory plant breeding programs that do not rely on climate-soil zonation as a result.

The Jungle Bunch (film)

The Jungle Bunch is a 2017 French computer-animated comedy-adventure film directed by David Alaux. Based on the animated series "The Jungle Bunch", the film was released in Italy on September 27, 2017 and was poorly received in the UK but was a box office success overall, with over a million admissions.
Plot.
An iceberg with an egg appears on the banks of the Jungle. Meanwhile, The Champs, consisting of the big guerror bengal tigress Natacha, an hippie three-toed sloth named Tony, a neurotic javan rhinoceros named Goliath and the crested porcupine Ricky, are engaged in saving all the inhabitants the Jungle, mainly due to the evil deeds of an koala named Igor. During the next chase, Igor almost managed to escape from the island in a small boat, but he collides with the iceberg, preventing the koala from leaving the shore. Igor tries to break the egg (delivered by the iceberg), but is defeated by The Champs.
As Natacha sends to Igor to the Island of the Lost, a small desert island where evil animals are exiled, he tells her that he left in the Jungle exploding mushrooms, which are already starting to explode at that moment. Natacha immediately hurries back to shore to save the rest of the inhabitants. During the ensuing fire in the Jungle, Ricky, for the sake of saving the rest, sacrifices himself, while throwing the egg to safety.
Natacha believes that the activities of The Champs led to the death of Ricky, and together with Goliath and Tony abolishes the team. Goliath, who considered himself unnecessary after the collapse of the team, leaves. Soon, an baby penguin hatches from the egg Ricky threw, whom Natacha calls Maurice and raises as her son. When Maurice grows up, he feels the desire to follow in the footsteps of his mother, against her will, and save all inhabitants of those who are in danger from other Evil animals. Maurice says goodbye to his mother, and sets out on his journey. In parallel scenes of Maurice growing, Igor has the seed of a tree with him, and nurtures its growth, and at the same time acquiring a lieutenant – Surimi the coconut crab.
Years later, the Jungle Bunch is busy rescuing elephants who were forced to serve the olive baboons under their threat to destroy the sacred totem. The team successfully coped with this mission. In the meantime, Igor finally waited for the tree to grow, and he, along with Surimi, went to the Island of the Lost.
Soon, the Jungle Bunch notices a burning tree and they arrive there, where they meet Igor, who lured them into a trap and learns from them that Maurice is Natacha's son. Igor talks about his plans to destroy them, and then The Champs, and then he leaves, leaving the Jungle Bunch to wait for them to die from the explosion of his mushrooms. The team managed to escape from the explosion due to Miguel's powerful sneeze, after which they head to Natacha.
Igor takes the mandrills under his army, who because of the Jungle Bunch can not engage in banditry. Igor developed the idea of undermining the cave, so that the Jungle will collapse and be flooded.
When the Jungle Bunch arrived at Natacha's home, she is pleased to meet her son Maurice and his grandson Junior, but soon learns from Maurice about the return of Igor and tells his son the story about the koala. Igor had wanted to join The Champs as their leader, but the others thought that he was no. Natacha decided to find Goliath with Tony and revive The Champs, while not wanting to involve Maurice and his Jungle Bunch in their affairs.
The next day, The Champs decided to interfere with Igor's plans, while cutting off the road to the Jungle Bunch, destroying the bridge. When The Champs find Igor, he, in turn, led them into his trap, but the team almost managed to defeat Igor. Maurice decided to help The Champs by catapulting himself and his son, but his intervention led to Igor escaping, and he took Junior with him as a hostage. Natacha shows Maurice that, through his fault, Igor escaped and kidnapped his son, and asks the "Jungle Bunch" not to intervene. Maurice himself was disappointed and removed from his own team. As a storm began to rage, Maurice's stripes were gradually washed off. The Champs reached Igor's lair, but they were ambushed and were captured by Igor.
Maurice soon finds himself near the pond and sees the memories where he leaves his home and finds an egg, from which a small fish hatched and he sheltered him, making him his son. At that time, Junior escapes from captivity and arrives at the pond where Maurice is still. Maurice is glad of the return of his son and finds out that The Champs are in captivity and many animals were enslaved, forced to grow mushroom-bombs for Igor. Maurice restores yellow stripes on his body and makes a new aquarium for Junior, since his son's main aquarium was still in Igor's lair.
Maurice and Junior return to the Jungle Bunch, which they wanted to save The Champs without Maurice's help, and with them, they penetrate inside the lair of Igor under the disguise of three mandrills. The heroes release The Champs and together they fight the baboons. Shortly after the defeat of the baboons, Igor activates the bombs and disappears. Maurice instructs The Champs to evacuate the inhabitants of the jungle, and he and the Jungle Bunch go to prevent the mushrooms from exploding.
After riding a minecart down to the main mushroom bomb, Gilbert suggests that they should knock down some bombs, in order to stop the giant mushroom bomb. Maurice succeeds, but he nearly relights the bombs when his belt lights on fire. Fortunately, Junior hops out of his aquarium and extinguishes the fire.
Having managed to save the jungle, The Champs and the Jungle Bunch again face Igor, who declares that he will never stop, but Maurice catapults Junior, who in turn overloads the ammunition, causing the koala's jetpack to malfunction. Soon, The Champs decided to retire, while the Jungle Bunch would continue their heroism.
Later in the post-credits scene it has revealed that Igor is still alive so he was thrown back on the Island Of The Lost in which he and Surimi was imprisoned for years on the beginning of the film. After the final credits, Igor found another seed on the island, but this time a seagull seizes it, meaning that he is stuck on the island forever and for good.
Release.
The film was released in France on July 26, 2017. In the UK and US, it was released on September 15, 2017. It was released in Australia on January 25, 2018.
Sequel.
A sequel to "The Jungle Bunch" is scheduled for release in 2023, with Benoît Somville to direct and David Alaux, Éric Tosti, and Jean-François Tosti returning to write the film.
Critical response.
In the US, the film was a failure among critics. On Rotten Tomatoes the film a rating of 35%, based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 4.8 out of 10. On Metacritic, the film received an score of 38 out of 100 based on 4 reviews.

Carl Froch vs. Mikkel Kessler II

Carl Froch vs. Mikkel Kessler II, billed as Warrior's Call, was a professional boxing match between IBF super middleweight champion Carl Froch and WBA (Regular) champion Mikkel Kessler. The fight took place on 25 May 2013. Froch was declared the winner by unanimous decision.
Background.
Froch and Kessler had first met both as part of the Super Six World Boxing Classic, a tournament involving the six best super middleweights in world boxing, which began in 2009. The unbeaten WBC champion Froch had begun the competition with a split decision victory over Andre Dirrell, whilst Kessler suffered the first defeat of his professional career in the first round with a defeat to Andre Ward. The pair's first fight then came in their second match of the tournament on 24 April 2010 with Kessler inflicting a first professional defeat on Froch winning a 12-round unanimous decision in a close hard fought contest on his home soil in Herning, Denmark.
Kessler was then forced to pull out of the Super Six due to the worsening of an eye injury that he suffered in his defeat to Ward. Meanwhile, Froch went on to defeat both Arthur Abraham and Glen Johnson on his way to meeting Ward in the final on 17 December 2011. Ward handed Froch the second defeat of his professional career with a 12-round unanimous decision to win the Super Six and unify his WBA belt with the WBC title Froch had since regained plus the vacant Ring and lineal titles.
Kessler had a year out of boxing on doctors recommendations before returning to defeat Mehdi Bouadla and Allan Green, before taking the WBA (Regular) title from Brian Magee (the "(Super)" belt still being held by Ward). Whilst Froch had also become champion again after knocking out Lucian Bute to grab the IBF title. He then stopped Yusaf Mack in his first defence before seeking to take on Kessler in a rematch for the chance to avenge his defeat to him, three years after their first encounter in the ring.
The Froch vs. Kessler rematch was first announced in January 2013 after a deal was reached between Eddie Hearn's Matchroom Sport and Team Sauerland with the fight to take place in Froch's home country this time at the O2 Arena in London.
The fight.
Froch had the better of the early rounds with Kessler starting slowly before firing back at Froch in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds as the fight really came to life. Next it was Froch's turn to get the better of the action in some furious exchanges before the pendulum swung back in Kessler's favour as he landed some more big shots of his own as the bout reached its closing stages. Both men continued at the high pace they had set with Froch coming on strong in the last round leaving Kessler hanging on as the final bell sounded. After the full 12 rounds the three ringside judges had scored a unanimous decision for Froch with scores of 115–113, 116–112 and 118–110 in his favour.
Aftermath.
Much like Kessler and Joe Calzaghe, Froch shares a mutual respect with Kessler and the two remain in touch and on good terms since the sharing the ring twice. Three time world champion Froch went on to have what turned out to be the two biggest fights of his career against fellow Brit George Groves and was victorious on both the first occasion and the rematch before announcing his retirement with a record of 33–2, the defeat to Kessler in their first fight and the loss to Ward being the only blemishes on his record. While Froch's avenged win over Kessler turned out to be the Dane's final fight and the five time world champion retired with a record of 46–3, only tasting defeat against Calzaghe, Ward and Froch.

Kent Town Brewery

Kent Town Brewery was a brewery in Kent Town, a suburb adjacent to the city of Adelaide on its eastern side, in South Australia. Its original name was Logue's Brewery, after its first proprietor.
History.
The brewery was founded on King William Street, Kent Town near First Creek in 1856 by Capt. Henry Spencer Crawford ( – 14 November 1861), and Edward Logue. Their partnership was dissolved in July 1857. Crawford appears to have been in charge of setting up the process. The brewery was from the start known as "Logue's Brewery", he being both proprietor and brewer. Logue had earlier been involved in the Halifax Street Brewery as a financial partner in W. H. Clark &amp; Co.
In March 1862 the brewery and the adjacent house, occupied by Logue and his family, was destroyed by fire.
This was followed in August by a flood, which swept two of his men, who were working to protect the building, into the culvert under King William Street, and one was drowned. The brewery was back in action early in 1863.
Sometime around 1860 he took Edwin Thomas Smith on as a partner. Logue died in 1865; his will would be the subject of a legal dispute. Smith continued operating the business, which he renamed Kent Town Brewery, and two years later was its proprietor. The cellars were enlarged in 1868.
Kent Town was subjected to another major flooding in July 1873, which did considerable damage to nearby properties, but apart from minor incursion into the cellars and some undercutting of the foundations the brewery was unaffected. 
Smith contracted Thomas English as architect for new premises, completed in 1876 at the nearby corner of Rundle Street and Dequetteville Terrace. Brown &amp; Thompson were the builders. He also had nine workmen's cottages built at the rear of the premises by contractor Dickin.
1888 takeover.
In 1888 the South Australian Brewing, Malting, and Wine and Spirit Company (later South Australian Brewing Company) was formed to take over the assets of The Kent Town Brewery, West End Brewery and Rounsevell &amp; Simms's wine and spirit business.
Building conversion.
The malt towers of the old Kent Town Brewery have now been turned into luxury apartments overlooking the Adelaide Park Lands and Adelaide city centre.

Other breweries operating in the late 1860s included:

The Commanders

The Commanders is an upcoming American anthology drama series that is set to premiere on History.
Premise.
"The Commanders" was described by History as: "an anthology scripted series envisioned as an annual television event ranging from four to 10 hours in length. It will dramatize pivotal moments in U.S. history that defined the legacy of the men who served as Presidents of the United States — from the first one, George Washington, to Number 42, Bill Clinton."
Production.
Development.
On March 21, 2017, History announced that they were developing an anthology drama series entitled "The Commanders" that focuses on different pivotal moments in U.S. history that defined the legacies of the men who served as President of the United States. The first installments of the series were said to focus on Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Theodore Roosevelt, James Madison and Thomas Jefferson. As part of the development process, History had optioned several biographies as source material for "The Commanders" including "The Breach: Inside the Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton" by Peter Baker, "Theodore Rex" by Edmund Morris, "Thomas Jefferson and the Tripoli Pirates" by Brian Kilmeade, "The Invisible Bridge: The Fall of Nixon and the Rise of Reagan" by Rick Perlstein, and "Alliance: The Inside Story of How Roosevelt, Stalin &amp; Churchill Won One War &amp; Began Another" by Jonathan Fenby. The series was set to be produced by A+E Studios with each season being overseen by different production staffs and writers.
On November 30, 2017, it was announced that History had made the decision to develop their adaptation of Peter Baker's book, separately of "The Commanders" series, as its own miniseries. The series was set to be written by R. J. Cutler and David K. Israel. Cutler was also set to direct the series and executive produce it alongside Barry Jossen. Production companies involved with the series included A+E Studios and FremantleMedia North America. While "The Breach" was to no longer air as the first installment in "The Commanders" anthology series, there were plans for it to be followed by limited series about other presidents. The miniseries was one of six such projects put in development in the spring of 2017, with the others still in the works.
On April 4, 2018, it was announced that History was no longer moving forward with "The Breach". It was further clarified that the miniseries had actually been intended to be the first season of "The Commanders" and the other seasons of the series were still in development. Producers for "The Breach" reportedly had trouble casting the lead role of Bill Clinton after making various offers to "A-list" actors which contributed to the season's demise.

Sorry for Your Loss

Sorry for Your Loss is an American drama series created by Kit Steinkellner that premiered on September 18, 2018 on Facebook Watch. The series follows a young widow and her family as they struggle to cope with the unexpected death of her husband and stars Elizabeth Olsen, Kelly Marie Tran, Jovan Adepo, Mamoudou Athie, and Janet McTeer. On December 13, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, which premiered on October 1, 2019.
On January 16, 2020, Facebook Watch canceled the series after two seasons.
Premise.
"Sorry for Your Loss" follows "Leigh Shaw, a young widow who is forced to reassess her life and relationships following the death of her husband."
Production.
Development.
Around 2013, playwright Kit Steinkellner initially devised the series after composing a writing sample that was inspired by a night when she had thought something terrible had happened to her husband. She proceeded to send that piece of writing to Robin Schwartz, a programming executive at the production company Big Beach, who liked Steinkellner's concept and had her draft a full script. By 2014, the production was set up at Showtime, then under the title "Widow", where it languished in the development process over the ensuing years. Eventually, Big Beach was able to extract the series from the network and began to shop it to various streaming services and pay-cable television networks.
On February 9, 2018, it was announced that Facebook had given the production a straight-to-series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Steinkellner was set to executive produce the series alongside Schwartz, Elizabeth Olsen, Lizzy Weiss, James Ponsoldt, Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf, Cynthia Pett, Brad Petrigala, and Jon Liebman. Additionally, Weiss was expected to serve as the series' showrunner, Ponsoldt as the director of multiple episodes, and Avy Kaufman as the series' casting director. Production companies slated to be involved in the series included Big Beach TV, a subsidiary of independent film company Big Beach.
On March 1, 2018, it was announced that the series had been retitled "Sorry for Your Loss" and its central premise was revealed. On August 3, 2018, it was reported that the series would premiere on September 18, 2018. On December 13, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season.
Casting.
Alongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen had been cast in the series' lead role. On March 1, 2018, it was announced that Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in a series regular role. The following day, it was reported that Jovan Adepo had joined the main cast and that Janet McTeer and Mamoudou Athie were in talks for series regular roles. A week later, it was announced that McTeer and Athie had officially joined the cast.
Filming.
Principal photography for the first season began on April 18, 2018 at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles. On June 1, 2018, filming took place in Altadena, California. Filming occurred from June 5 to June 8, 2018 at the Parker Palm Springs hotel in Palm Springs, California.
Release.
Marketing.
On August 13, 2018, a series of "first-look" images from the series were released. On August 28, 2018, the official trailer for the series was released.
Premiere.
The series had its world premiere at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The first four episodes of the series were screened, followed by a Q &amp; A with creator Kit Steinkellner, Director James Ponsoldt, and stars Lizzy Olsen and Jovan Adepo as part of the festival's Primetime series of television screenings.
Reception.
Critical response.
The series has been met with a positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 93% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.58 out of 10 based on 30 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, "Thoroughly honest and insightful, "Sorry For Your Loss" tackles a sensitive theme, but with a witty touch." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 83 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "universal acclaim." 
In a positive review, "The Atlantic"s Sophie Gilbert offered effusive praise describing the show as the "kind of series that’s instantly so fully formed, so funny and candid and wrenching right from the start, that you almost question the emotional propriety of it all." Similarly enthusiastic, "The Daily Beast"s Kevin Fallon said of the series, ""Sorry For Your Loss" is a gem of a show. With a cast this impressive—in Olsen, an Avenger; in Tran, a Star Wars alum; in McTeer, a renowned Oscar nominee—a series this well-executed would ordinarily be a marquee entry in the fall TV season." In another favorable critique, "Collider"s Allison Keene commended the show saying, ""Sorry for Your Loss" is an intense, emotionally raw meditation on grief. And yet, it’s never overwhelming as much as engrossing." In a further approving evaluation, "Salon"s Melanie McFarland commended the performances of the cast saying, "The feelings Olsen, Tran and the rest of the cast capture come across as true and natural, more affirming than depressing, a difficult balancing act to pull off in the most typical of dramas and in brighter months."
In a more mixed assessment, "Slate"s Inkoo Kang criticized the series saying, "Good intentions and all-around excellent performances can't make "Sorry for Your Loss" add up to the sum of its parts. Its keen sensitivity points to the dearth of grounded, relatable shows about loss, but falls short of filling that gap itself." In a negative review, "IndieWire"s Ben Travers gave the series a grade of "C-" and described it as, "little more than a meditation on death, offering a turgid reminder that the end is inescapable for us all and can be devastating for those we leave behind."

Jū-Ni

Jū-Ni is a Michelin Star Omakase style sushi restaurant located in San Francisco, California founded by Geoffrey Lee and Tan Truong.
History.
The concept behind Jū-Ni came together in 2015 when Lee decided that he wanted to start his own restaurant. They used the existing Candybar space for their new restaurant. By November of 2015, Candybar closed to the public and construction for Jū-Ni began.
The restaurant opened on February 29, 2016. Since then, it has won several awards including the "San Francisco Chronicle" Rising Star Chef 2016, "San Francisco" Rising Star Chef, and One Michelin Star.
Critical reception.
According to the Michelin review, "A meal may begin with a tasting of seasonal vegetables—think tomatoes over edamame hummus—before proceeding to an array of nigiri, painstakingly sourced straight from Tokyo’s own Tsukiji fish market and delicately draped over well-seasoned pillows of rice." Restaurant critic Michael Bauer wrote in the "San Francisco Chronicle" that "Ju-ni is a fascinating lesson in the precision needed to raise a piece of fish, a pad of rice and a few seasonings to ethereal heights." The Zagat restaurant review website describes Jū-Ni as an "upscale omakase bistro serving a spendy set menu of chef’s choice sushi that’s updated regularly and features ingredients imported from Tokyo (plus a few drinks)." In "SF Weekly", reviewer Peter Lawrence Kane wrote, "A fat pile of ikura (salmon roe) marinated in soy sauce, sake, and honey and slathered with shaved ankimo (monkfish liver, the foie gras of the sea) that's stored in a "super-freezer" to keep it chilled far below zero was by far the highlight of my night, made more so by the admonition to eat it right away, in one bite." Writing in "Condé Nast Traveler", reviewer Jenna Scatena wrote, "The intimate, Eastern-inspired design can make even the most anxious diner feel zen, while the small (12-seat!) sushi bar makes for a cozy dining experience", and "Give over all your trust to the chef; you'll be thankful that you did."

Media coverage of the 1943 Bengal famine

The Bengal famine of 1943-44 was a major famine in the Bengal province in British India during World War II. An estimated 2.1 million, out of a population of 60.3 million, died from starvation, malaria and other diseases aggravated by malnutrition, population displacement, unsanitary conditions, and lack of health care. Millions were impoverished as the crisis overwhelmed large segments of the economy and social fabric.
Calcutta's two leading English-language newspapers were "The Statesman" (at that time a British-owned newspaper) and "Amrita Bazar Patrika". In the early months of the famine, the government applied pressure on newspapers to "calm public fears about the food supply" and follow the official stance that there was no rice shortage. This effort had some success; "The Statesman" published editorials asserting that the famine was due solely to speculation and hoarding, while "berating local traders and producers, and praising ministerial efforts." News of the famine was also subject to strict war-time censorship – even use of the word "famine" was prohibited – leading "The Statesman" later to remark that the UK government "seems virtually to have withheld from the British public knowledge that there was famine in Bengal at all".
Beginning in mid-July 1943 and more so in August, however, these two newspapers began publishing detailed and increasingly critical accounts of the depth and scope of the famine, its impact on society, and the nature of British, Hindu, and Muslim political responses. For example, a headline in "Amrita Bazar Patrika" that month warned "The Famine conditions of 1770 are already upon us," alluding to an earlier Bengal famine that caused the deaths of one third of Bengal's population. It also published an editorial cartoon showing starving peasants gazing at distant international food aid ships with the caption "A Mirage! A Mirage!" "The Statesman"s reportage and commentary were similarly pointed, as for example when it opined that the famine was "man-made".
A turning point in news coverage came in late August 1943, when the editor of "The Statesman", Ian Stephens, had a series of graphic photographs of the victims taken, some of which he published on 22 and 29 August. Publication of the images greatly affected both domestic and international perceptions and sparked an international media frenzy. In Britain, "The Guardian" called the situation "horrible beyond description". Not only had the rest of the world been unaware of the famine: many in India itself had had little idea of the scope of it. The images had a profound effect and marked "for many, the beginning of the end of colonial rule". Stephens' decision to publish them and to adopt a defiant editorial stance won accolades from many (including the Famine Inquiry Commission), and has been described as "a singular act of journalistic courage and conscientiousness, without which many more lives would have surely been lost". The photographs spurred "Amrita Bazar Patrika" and the Indian Communist Party's organ, "The People's War", to publish similar images; the latter would make photographer Sunil Janah famous.

The United States intends to build 13 small patrol vessels, based on the Damen Stan 2606 patrol vessel design, for small Caribbean nations, to be known as the Defiant class. The US Navy, which will play an oversight role in the ship's construction, also calls the design Near Coastal Patrol Vessels. The $54 million contract was awarded to Metal Shark Boats of Louisiana.
Partner nations will include Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Guatemala.
Like the US Coast Guard's very successful , also based on the Damen 2606 design, the Defiant-class vessels will be equipped with a stern launching ramp.
The vessels will be able to accommodate a crew of ten or more—similar to the Marine Protector class. The vessel will be powered by a pair of C32 Caterpillar diesel engines.

Trachycarpeae

Trachycarpeae is a tribe of palms in subfamily Coryphoideae of the plant family Arecaceae. It has the widest distribution of any tribe in Coryphoideae and is found on all continents (except Antarctica), though the greatest concentration of species is in Southeast Asia. Trachycarpeae includes palms from both tropical and subtropical zones; the northernmost naturally-occurring palm is a member of this tribe ("Chamaerops humilis"). Several genera can be found in cultivation in temperate areas, for example species of "Trachycarpus", "Chamaerops", "Rhapidophyllum" and "Washingtonia".
Description.
Palms in this tribe have palmate leaves with induplicate folds (reduplicate in "Guihaia"). Plants may be tall, single-stemmed trees (e.g. "Copernicia", "Brahea", "Pritchardia"), acaulescent with short, squat trunks (e.g. "Maxburretia", "Johannesteijsmannia"), multi-stemmed (e.g. "Rhapis", "Acoelorrhaphe") or branched and prostrate (e.g. "Serenoa"). These palms flower regularly throughout their lives (pleonanthic) and may be dioecious, monoecious or hermaphroditic.
Taxonomy.
Trachycarpeae is one of eight tribes in the subfamily Coryphoideae. The tribe is monophyletic, but phylogenetic studies have yet to reveal its closest relatives, though they could be the Phoeniceae, or the Sabaleae and Cryosophileae. Initially described as tribe 'Livistoneae', the name Trachycarpeae has priority. In previous classifications, all the members of this tribe were included in tribe Corypheae.
Trachycarpeae is divided into two subtribes: Rhapidinae have flowers with three separate carpels, whereas in subtribe Livistoniinae the flower carpels are free at the base, but the styles are fused together. All genera in Rhapidinae are native to the Old World, except North American "Rhapidophyllum". Livistoninae are widely distributed in both the New World and Southeast Asia and Australia. A single species ("Livistona carinensis") occurs in Africa. Several genera in this tribe have yet to be allocated to a subtribe, due to a lack of convincing data from phylogenetic studies.
Rhapidinae
Livistoninae
Unplaced genera
The above classification was published prior to the recognition of the genera "Saribus" and "Lanonia"; however, both are clearly members of subtribe Livistoniinae. "Saribus" includes species formerly in "Livistona" and monotypic "Pritchardiopsis", while "Lanonia" species were previously included in "Licuala".

Andrew Rebori's house bat ("Scotophilus andrewreborii") is a species of bat found in Africa.
Taxonomy and etymology.
It was described as a new species in 2014.
The eponym for the species name "andrewreborii" is Andrew N. Rebori (1948–2011), who "maintained a key interest in animals, especially bats."
The IUCN has questioned whether "andrewreborii" is the correct species name for this taxa, given the nomenclature rule known as the Principle of Priority.
The IUCN has stated that the correct name for this species may be "Scotophilus colias", if using the Principle of Priority.
Description.
The fur of its back is reddish or mahogany in color.
Its ventral fur is tan to orange, with the chin and sides of body darker in color.
Its forearm is .
Conservation.
It is currently evaluated as least concern by the IUCN.
It meets the criteria for this classification because it has a wide geographic range, its range includes protected areas, and it tolerates human-altered landscapes.

Aloy

Aloy is a fictional character and protagonist of the 2017 video game "Horizon Zero Dawn" and its upcoming sequel "Horizon Forbidden West". In the games' post-apocalyptic tribal setting, she is born in 3021, raised as an outcast, and trains as a warrior in order to win a ritual competition to discover her mother's identity. After narrowly evading an assassination attempt, she embarks on a journey to stop a cult that worships an artificial intelligence bent on the world's destruction, while also hunting machines that have grown hostile to humans. She has been critically praised for her design and characterization. She is voiced by American voice actress Ashly Burch and modeled after Dutch actress Hannah Hoekstra.
Character development.
Aloy was created as a character who could provide many tactical options in battle. As a "hunter at heart", she has little compassion for machines beyond a "hunter's respect". She also has a gritty personality, disliking "comforts or ease", and tends to be "very forthright and blunt, sometimes even confrontational" in how she addresses issues. Guerrilla Games always envisioned the game as starring a strong female character, with game director Mathijs de Jonge citing Sarah Connor from "Terminator", Ellen Ripley from "Alien", and Ygritte from "Game of Thrones" as influences. Sony decided to do rigorous market testing, believing that adding a female lead might be a "risk", but approved her as the lead role. The developers were aware of the strong female character cliche and tried to make a more human character with a more interesting personality. Aloy's physical likeness was based on the Dutch actress Hannah Hoekstra.
Appearances.
"Horizon: Zero Dawn".
Aloy is first introduced as an infant who has been entrusted to Rost's care, a man who has been cast out by the Nora tribe. Six years later, while exploring on her own, she falls into a forbidden bunker that was created by ancient humans. While trying to escape from the destroyed facility, she discovers an augmented reality device known as a Focus before being rescued by Rost. Despite his misgivings, Rost allows her to keep the Focus, which she soon develops an affinity for. The next morning, while learning to hunt with Rost, she uses the Focus to rescue Teb, an injured member of the Nora tribe who has recklessly fallen into the path of machines. Aloy expresses the desire to learn the identity of her mother, and Rost suggests training to compete in the Proving, a coming-of-age ritual that would not only allow her entry into the Nora, but give her the answers she seeks as a boon if she wins.
The game skips forwards twelve years to when she has become a skilled warrior and huntress due to her intensive training. She attends the Proving, winning the competition and being declared a Nora. Before she can ask about her parents, the tribe is attacked by a group of cultists led by the fanatical Helis, who seeks to kill Aloy. Most of her fellow warriors are murdered, but Helis hesitates when stabbing Aloy and is attacked by Rost, who then sacrifices himself to protect her from a blast. When she comes to inside All-Mother Mountain, one of the tribe's elders explains that Aloy was actually found in front of another bunker inside the mountain, and their disagreement over whether she was a good or evil omen led to her exile. However, her Focus reveals that Helis was given orders along with a picture of an older woman who looks just like her.
Aloy is declared a Seeker and sets out to avenge the attack on the tribe. Eventually, she is contacted by a man named Sylens, who reveals that the older woman is Dr. Elisabet Sobeck. Her genetic profile allows her to access the headquarters of Faro Automated Solutions, where she sees that Elisabet was a skilled scientist who was called in to try to stop a swarm of self-replicating combat robots that went rogue due to the recklessness of the company's CEO, Ted Faro. She then sets out to discover what Project Zero Dawn, which Elisabet created, planned to do.
Eventually, Aloy discovers that Zero Dawn was a project that involved allowing humanity to go extinct and reviving them using artificial wombs after the threat of the robots was dealt with and the Earth was "re-seeded". However, a mysterious signal attacked Zero Dawn's AI, GAIA, forcing her to self-destruct and unshackling her component processes. With nothing to protect humanity from the rogue AI of HADES, initially created as an emergency "reset switch" for the planet, GAIA was forced to order ELEUTHIA, a sub-function tasked with maintaining the artificial wombs, to clone Elisabet using DNA stored for the defunct "Lightkeeper Protocol", predicting that her genes would cause her to become the world's savior once again. Aloy was brought outside the facility by a robot, leading the elders to believe she had mysteriously appeared there. 
Intrigued by rumors of a new wave of dangerous machines at the edge of the Banuk land, Aloy took a detour from her mission to explore the Cut. After learning more about the "Spirit" from Ourea, Aloy attempts to fulfil her request by saving the mysterious entity. Soon afterwards, she teams up with Ourea's brother, Aratak. Subsequently, they head to an ancient ruin at Thunder's Drum, the Firebreak facility to free the "Spirit". Later, Aloy discovers that HEPHAESTUS, one of GAIA's sub-functions, took control of the facility from an unknown remote location, enslaving the previous governing AI, CYAN, who Ourea earlier deemed as the voice of the "Spirit". After Aloy, Ourea and Aratak defeat the enemy, they head to the facility's core. Ourea sacrifices herself to finish the override, with Aloy later consoling Aratak for his loss. They quickly flee from the collapsing facility, leaving Ourea's body behind. After a successful escape, Aloy and Aratak meet again at Ourea's Retreat to discuss matters with CYAN. Prior to finishing the last mission at the Cut, Aloy attempts to converse with Aratak, who requests for her help to eliminate the remaining threats caused by HEPHAESTUS. After finishing the mission, Aloy returns to Ourea's apprentice Naltuk, who thanks her for assisting the Banuk. He then bids her with a respectful farewell. 
Reaching the entrance to GAIA Prime, Aloy witnesses a series of significant damages caused by GAIA's self-destruction and is skeptical that GAIA could ever be repaired. While exploring the Zero Dawn facility, Aloy also learns that Dr. Sobeck sacrificed herself to close a malfunctioning vent and save the project from the encroaching all-consuming robots.
Upon realizing this, Aloy sets out to find the Master Override that can shut down HADES. With the help of Sylens, she obtains the Override and confronts HADES, shutting it down in the nick of time. In an ending scene, she is seen finding the body of Dr. Sobeck and getting closure in the search for her origins. 
In other media.
Aloy has appeared in other media outside of the "Horizon games." She was a playable character in the PlayStation 4 version of "" and makes a cameo appearance in "Astro's Playroom". Aloy was added to "Fortnite Battle Royale" on April 15, 2021, for the Chapter 2, Season 6 "Primal" event. A limited time "Aloy Cup" was available to PlayStation players, while a "Team Up!" mode with Lara Croft from "Tomb Raider" was added. In September 2021, Aloy was given out as a free character for PS4 and PS5 players of the game "Genshin Impact", while players on other platforms will receive her for free in October 2021.
Reception.
Peter Tieryas of "Kotaku" praised the character of Aloy, finding the scene where Aloy talks to her father's grave moving in part due to how "real" their relationship felt and how it shows how things have changed for Aloy since her childhood. Malindy Hetfield of "Polygon" praised Aloy as "inspiring and captivating", but also called her "not particularly relatable" compared to the game's other female characters due to her "flawlessness". Aloy's story about her origins resonated with Sam Loveridge of "GamesRadar+" and inspired her to seek out her own birth parents. Lucas Sullivan of the same site called her "one of gaming's greatest female leads". She was ranked as one of the best video game characters of the 2010s by "Polygon" staff by Colin Campbell praising the character by stating that "She’s pragmatic but compassionate, iron-willed but open-minded. In a 31st-century world with its own norms and taboos, particularly around gender, Aloy refuses to let anyone else tell her how to live." "Paste" magazine writer Holly Green included Aloy as the best new game characters of 2017. Swapna Krishna of "Wired" called Aloy as one of her "video game protagonists" as "jerk" and stated that "we'd never root for them if they weren't, well, at least somewhat likable." "TheGamer" also included Aloy on their "Iconic Video Game Characters", stating that "Aloy is one of the best protagonists of the last decade, of which there are many to choose from, mostly because of her strong-willed nature and ability to act strong in difficult situations."
Ashly Burch, the voice actress for Aloy, won an award for "best gaming performance" at the 35th Golden Joystick Awards. She thanked the developers, saying that playing the character made her a "braver and stronger woman", and that she hoped Aloy would be inspiring to other women.

Sextus Palpellius Hister

Sextus Palpellius Hister was a Roman senator and general who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of March-July 43 with Lucius Pedanius Secundus as his colleague.
An inscription from Pietas Julia in Istria, erected by one Gaius Precius Felix Napolitanus, provides us many details of his "cursus honorum", although not in chronological order. Hister began his career as one of the "decemviri stlitibus judicandis", one of the four boards that form the "vigintiviri"; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. His next documented office was military tribune of Legio XIV Gemina, at the time stationed in Germania Superior at Moguntiacum. Of the traditional Republican magistracies, only plebeian tribune and praetor are recorded in this inscription, but one can assume he held the first in this series of offices, quaestor. The inscription also attests he was a "legatus" (which could mean he was a governor of an imperial province or a commander of a Roman legion) and governor of a public province. While Histor was a praetor, he also achieved the honor of being a "comites" or companion of the emperor Claudius.
One office Histor held not recorded in the Istrian inscription was governor of the imperial province of Pannonia; Tacitus is our source for this fact. While the translation of Alfred John Church and William Jackson Brodribb call this governor "P. Atellius Hister", editions of Tacitus more recent than that used by Church and Brodribb call him "Palpellius Hister". Further, P. Atellius Hister is not otherwise attested. Tacitus attests Palpellius Hister held this post in the year 50, when Vannius, king of the Quadi, was driven from his throne and kingdom by Vibilius, king of the Hermunduri, and two sons of Vannius' sister, Vangio and Sido. Although the emperor Claudius declined to intervene in this conflict, he gave orders to Hister to have his legions and some picked Auxiliaries encamped on the banks of the Danube "as a support to the conquered and a terror to the conqueror, who might otherwise, in the elation of success, disturb the peace of our empire."

Princess Nakrang (Lelang)

According to the ancient Korean record of Samguk Sagi, the Princess of Nakrang (; ? – 32) was a daughter of Choi Ri () who was the king of Nakrang Kingdom. However, the kingdom's sovereignty is often disputed, which is often viewed as an independent kingdom by Korean scholars while Chinese and Japanese academic communities usually interpret the name Nakrang to be referring to Lelang Commandery. 
Outline.

The Lowest is an album by bassist and tubist Red Callender, recorded for the MetroJazz label in 1958.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden states: "These sessions feature quite a few of the rising stars of the West Coast jazz scene... As a bassist, Callender was very much in demand and displays his immense talent in a rather subdued way. He sets aside his bass to play tuba on several tracks, proving himself as a convincing soloist on an instrument almost always relegated to rhythm, in addition to being out of favor once the bass came into jazz ensembles".

Raising the Flag on the Three-Country Cairn

Raising the Flag on the Three-Country Cairn is a historic photograph taken on 27 April 1945, which was the last day of the Second World War in Finland. It depicts a Finnish Army patrol of Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1 (), raising the Finnish flag on the three-country cairn between Norway, Sweden, and Finland to celebrate the last German troops withdrawing from Finland. The photograph was taken by the commander of Infantry Regiment 1, Colonel Väinö Oinonen (alternatively V.J. Oinonen). It became a widely circulated symbol of the end of World War II in Finland.
Background.
Amidst World War II, Finland fought both the Winter War of 1939–1940 and Continuation War of 1941–1944 against the Soviet Union. During the latter, Finland cooperated with Nazi Germany, which had the 200,000-strong 20th Mountain Army led by Lothar Rendulic stationed in Finnish Lapland. In September 1944, Finland agreed to a separate peace with the Soviet Union; a peace which required that Finland disarm or expel any German soldiers from Finland. The demand led to the Lapland War; the 20th Mountain Army started withdrawing north towards occupied Norway with the Finnish Army's III Corps, led by General Hjalmar Siilasvuo, in pursuit. By November, the war came to an effective end when most German units had withdrawn to Norway and the Lyngen Line—although some entrenched German forces still remained in Finland at Kilpisjärvi in the corridor leading to the border tripoint between Norway, Sweden, and Finland.
On 25 April 1945, after it was determined that the final German formations in Finnish territory were withdrawing, a 60-strong battle patrol led by Captain Valkonen was assigned to reconnoitre if Finnish Lapland was free from "Wehrmacht" forces. The detachment was assembled from 1st Company, Battle Group Loimu, Infantry Regiment 1, and departed on its mission at 1:00 pm the same day from southern Kilpisjärvi. The ski patrol advanced north-west towards Norway for around until it was split in two near the Saana fell. The smaller group would approach the Norwegian border along the road while the bulk of the patrol would continue with Captain Valkonen towards the three-country cairn farther off. They reached the cairn by 1:15 am on 26 April after skiing approximately more. Pioneer Antti Poikola attached a small flag of Finland to the cairn and the patrol reported back by radio that no Germans had been sighted on Finnish soil. Valkonen and his team shot three gun salutes at the cairn before leaving; the shots rang out across the fells and startled a Swedish border guard unit nearby.
Around noon of 26 April, Major Martti Santavuori, commander of the battalion, and a mixed Finnish–Swedish patrol arrived at the tripoint. A German unit approached them from Norway, and, with knowledge that they would not engage the Swedes, Major Santavuori signaled the German leader to meet up at the border. An Austrian soon skied closer and they discussed the war, both past and future. Major Santavuori and the saluted, shook hands and bid each other "as good a future as fate has to offer" before parting ways.
Flag-raising.
On 27 April, commander of Infantry Regiment 1, Colonel Väinö Oinonen (alternatively V.J. Oinonen), arrived at the cairn to inspect the situation with a detachment of soldiers including photography specialists, a larger flag, and a better flagpole. The war flag of Finland was ceremoniously raised on the cairn and Colonel Oinonen took the titular photo—with the -high Golddabakti fell of Norway in the background. Amidst the festivities, a shout of "?!" ("Who's there?!") surprised the Finnish soldiers. Even though the area had been inspected, a German unit lay waiting in position on the Norwegian side of the border. The flag-raising soldiers took cover behind the cairn. Battle was avoided after a Swedish army officer approached to act as an intermediary. Soon after, Colonel Oinonen resolved the situation with two , who shared German Juno cigarettes with him. The officers saluted each other and went their ways; the time was 1:30 pm. On 28 April, General Siilasvuo sent a telegram to Finnish Commander-in-Chief C.G.E. Mannerheim, reporting that the had been expelled from Northern Finland.
Aftermath.
The picture became widely circulated in Finland and was an example of an iconic war photograph in Finnish World War II history. It was compared to similar pictures, such as the American "Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima" and the Soviet "Raising a Flag over the Reichstag", although it was not considered to have become as symbolic as they were. In fact, the Finnish popular memory of the conflict relied equally on illustrations, such as the cover of "The Unknown Soldier", a 1954 war novel about the Continuation War.

Sound Broadcast Services

Sound Broadcast Services (SBS) was a British electronics manufacturer that produced terrestrial radio broadcast equipment. Originally known as Sound Broadcast Services, the name was later invariably abbreviated to SBS and more commonly written as lower case sbs in the company's documents and marketing materials.
The company enjoyed considerable success in the UK market during the 1990s following deregulation of the UK broadcast radio industry. The company's products were also exported globally, particularly to developing countries. SBS was a major supplier to BBC World Service.
Products and services.
The company produced a range of products that were associated with FM broadcast radio transmission. During the 1990s the company produced audio limiting and stereo encoding products at a time when commercial broadcasters throughout the UK were needing to upgrade this type of equipment.
The company's products were:
The company produced a range of cable head end equipment for multichannel audio distribution. These included low power versions of the FMLP2 and FM10 exciters and a 4-channel version called Quadmod. Passive combiners were also made with varying numbers of inputs.
Towards the end of the brand's life, a range of audio interface products were manufactured. This product line was sold to the Sonifex company in 2006 and marketed under the ProAVM brand.
As of 2019, only the RX400 link receiver remains available from Eddystone Broadcast.
The FM30 exciter was a development from the original FM25. The main difference being the amplifier module and an uprated mains transformer. The FM25 first appeared in 1990. The production of these exciters ran for more than 20 years with many hundreds being produced.
The design of most of the products used sealed cases (no ventilation) and linear power supplies. This resulted in very long life, particularly when used in dirty environments. The sealed cases meant that the electronics were protected from dirt and corrosion. Products such as the exciters, audio failure detectors and radio links remain in regular use around the world, despite being 20–30 years old.
Locations.
SBS started in North London. It moved to Hastings, East Sussex in 1991. In 2002, the company was moved to Pitchill near Evesham in Warwickshire with Eddystone Radio. A few years later, SBS/Eddystone moved to Alcester in Warwickshire where the company remains.
History.
The company started in the late 1980s, supplying equipment to unlicensed broadcasters. At that time it was based in north London. The highly regulated broadcast industry in the UK at that time meant that the market was not open to small companies. At the end of the 1980s, the UK radio industry was deregulated, with new 'Incremental Radio' stations licensed and launched from 1989 onwards. Stations were no longer required to sign transmission contracts with the government owned transmission operator, the IBA. During 1991, the company relocated to Hastings in East Sussex. Throughout the 1990s, SBS became one of the biggest suppliers and installers for the newly licensed stations.
Also during the 1990s, SBS became sales agents for some other equipment such as audio processors. The increased competition in the UK radio industry meant that existing commercial radio stations needed to upgrade their equipment. SBS dominated this upgrade market with audio processors and the MaXiM/MPX5/OS products.
Towards the end of the 1990s, the company started exporting through a number of agents. Its products were particularly popular in developing countries. This was also aided by BBC World Service, which had started using SBS equipment.
In 2002, SBS effectively merged with Eddystone Radio, the UK's oldest manufacturer of high power radio transmitters (in fact SBS had taken over Eddystone). In the years after the merger, it was the SBS brand that gradually disappeared as the products were replaced with new Eddystone versions. SBS had also relocated to Worcestershire with Eddystone.
The company's original web sites (www.sbs.uk.com and www.sbsfm.com) no longer exist.

Thanks to that system, officials at Ukroboronprom siphoned off funds from a $39 million contract to supply details for Antonov AN-32 aircraft to the Ministry of Defence of Iraq.
On 1 November 2018, Serhiy Pashynskyi was included in the Russian sanctions list in connection with Ukraine’s unfriendly actions towards citizens and legal entities of the Russian Federation.
In the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election he lost his parliamentary seat after losing his constituency.
Controversies.
The Kyiv Snipers' Case.
On 18 February 2014, during the protests on Maidan Nezalezhnosti (Independence Square), a video appeared on the network in which Serhiy Pashynskyi takes sniper weapons out from the square - there was a hunting Norinco CQ-A carbine, clone of M4A1 variant of M4 carbine. The link to the video was posted on the official website of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine.
According to former officers of the Georgian army, snipers Koba Nergadze and Alexander Revazishvili, 19 February 2014, Serhiy Pashynskyi and Volodymyr Parasyuk brought bags with weapons to the Hotel "Ukraine". Pashynskyi ordered a group of snipers to shoot at protesters on the Maidan Nezalezhnosti and the soldiers of the Berkut. Pashynskyi also took part in the shooting, using a Kalashnikov 7.62 mm rifle. After a short turn, the snipers had to change their position.
Corporate raid of Zhytomyr confectionery factory.
On 27 November 2015, the "ZhL", ALC (previously - "Zhytomyrsʹki lasoshchi", CJSC) announced the upcoming raider seizure of the enterprise. Member of the supervisory board of the company, Denis Dolinsky, stated: "People’s deputy Serhiy Pashynskyi and his business partner Serhiy Tyshchenko are preparing an attempt to raider seizureof the Zhytomyr confectionery factory. A corresponding illegal court decision was received by the judge of the Ternopil District Administrative Court N.I. Khodachkevich. This is not Pashinsky’s first attempt to seize the factory." The company asked the authorities to help sort out the situation. Three days later, on 30 November, buses with so-called "titushky" arrived at the factory - it was a group of 200 sports people who were tasked to seize the enterprise by force. National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine launched an investigation into this case. On the night of 5 January 2016, the police detained 134 people who staged a mass brawl with shots near the enterprise. The president of the company, Ihor Boyko, also accused Pashynskyi and Tyshchenko of this attempt of a corporate raid.
Confrontation with Transparency International.
On 16 July 2016, the head of the Ukrainian branch of the Transparency International, Andriy Marusov, was attacked twice by unknown persons, as a result a laptop with archive data was stolen. Marusov stated that these events were not an accident, since the attackers addressed him by name. He linked the robbery to recent statements by the Chief Military Prosecutor of Ukraine Anatolii Matios and deputies close to Serhiy Pashynskyi who accused member of the board of Transparency International Ukraine, Vitaly Kasko, of “allegedly slowing down the investigation of [Serhiy] Kurchenko’s corruption.”
In July 2017, Transparency International appealed for Serhiy Pashynskyi to refute false statements about failure of defense contracts. Earlier, TI demanded to disclose a Court decision, on the basis of which USD 1.5 billion were confiscated to the budget of Ukraine. This money was allegedly arrested on the accounts of former President of Ukraine Viktor Yanukovych and his entourage.
Purchase of military equipment.
According to a journalistic investigation published in the "Novoye Vremya" journal in March 2018, Serhiy Pashynskyi, along with Oleh Hladkovsʹkyy, first deputy of the National Security and Defense Council, participated in the purchase of military equipment at an overvalued prices for the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine. The investigation indicated that the obsolete BMP-1 (produced in 1966-1983) were bought from the Polish company "Wtorplast", which, in turn, purchased equipment in the Czech Republic. Minister of Defence, Stepan Poltorak, in an interview with the BBC said that “The information is not true, because the Ministry of Defense bought military vehicles for $169,000. According the information I read in the magazine, there was about $205,000,” confirming the fact of "Ukroboronprom"'s purchase of equipment through a chain of intermediaries.
Criminal prosecution.
Oschadbank case.
In November 2002, the Prosecutor General of Ukraine accused Serhiy Pashynskyi of stealing $4 million in 1999-2000, as well as committing fraudulent transactions in obtaining loans from other banks. On 30 November 2002, the Pechersky court of Kyiv, within the framework of the criminal case, issued a sanction for taking Pashynskyi into custody. He was arrested on suspicion of embezzling the funds of "Sberbank of Ukraine", intended to compensate Soviet deposits to citizens who have reached the age of 80. Charges were raised under article 191, part 5, and article 222, part 2 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine (appropriation of someone else's property in especially large amounts by abuse of office; fraud). On 6 February 2003, the Appeal Court of Kyiv released Pashynskyi under a restriction of travel order. According to the "Ukrayinska Pravda", Yulia Tymoshenko personally came to the Lukyanivska Prison to take out Pashynskyi, whom the investigation allegedly wanted to re-arrest.
New Year's Eve shooting (2016–2017).
On New Year's Eve from 2016 to 2017 Serhiy Pashynskyi shot in the foot of a resident of the Kyiv's suburb Vyacheslav Khimikus. According to the deputy, he defended himself. Vyacheslav Khimikus claims that he struck the deputy with a bottle on the head after he sent the weapon to him. From a shot made with a distance of 15 cm, gunpowder burn remained on the leg of Khimikus. In addition, Pashynskyi didn't fired a warning shot. The surgerist who operated Khimikus confirmed that the shooting was done from the top down, because the bone fragments were displaced down from the pelvis.
On 26 July 2017, the Prosecutor General's Office closed the case against Serhiy Pashynskyi, but on 13 December, Pechersky District Court of Kyiv ordered the resumption of the investigation into the criminal proceedings. The court recognized the decision of the investigator of the Prosecutor General as unlawful and quashed it. In May 2018, Pechersky Court ordered the Prosecutor General to investigate the disappearance of the video from the scene. On 29 May 2018, the GPU recognized the fact of the manipulation of video and entered information on this case into the "Unified register of pre-trial investigations".
In October 2019 the State Bureau of Investigation opened an investigated into Pashynskyi for allegedly "causing grievous bodily harm to a citizen" during a shooting incident in 2016 in which Pashynskyi shot a man in the leg after allegedly being attacked by him (the person shot claimed it was vice-versa). On 7 October 2019, Pechersky District Court of Kyiv decided to detain Pashynskyi until 4 December 2019 (without bail). On 18 October, Court of Appeal upheld the decision to detain the former deputy.
On 18 March 2021 the Vasylkivskyi District Court of Kyiv Oblast acquitted Pashynskyi of the charge (of inflicting grievous bodily harm on Khimikus).
Awards.
Serhiy Pashynskyi has two award weapons - Glock 19 pistol (28 March 2014) and Fort-224 assault rifle (copy of IWI Tavor 21) (14 October 2014).

In February 2015, the 24-year-old son of Serhiy Pashynskyi, Anton Pashynskyi, became the top manager of State Foreign Trade Enterprise "Spetstechnoexport", Ukrainian entity focused on export-import activities at foreign armaments markets. The company confirmed this information. According to the Ukrainian media, Anton does not have a specialized education in the export and import of weapons.

Overwatch World Cup

The Overwatch World Cup (OWWC) is an annual international "Overwatch" esports tournament organized by Blizzard Entertainment, the game's developer. The tournament format has varied in each year, with the most recent one involving a preliminary stage in which national teams competed against others in a single-elimination tournament system to claim the five qualification spots in the group stages, which also included five national teams who prequalified via ranking. Top-ranked teams from the group stage advance to a single-elimination playoff bracket at Blizzard's BlizzCon event every November. The first three World Cups were won by South Korea, while the most recent one was won by the United States.
History.
According to former lead game director Jeff Kaplan, "Overwatch" was not developed with any dedication towards esports. Dan Szymborski of "ESPN" stated that "Overwatch" was poised as the next big esport for having a sufficiently different look and playstyle from established esports titles like "" and "Call of Duty", enough variety in maps and characters, and strong support from Blizzard to maintain the game for a long time. Bryant Francis writing for "Gamasutra" noted the speed and short match times of "Overwatch" make the game highly favorable for viewership, further supporting the title as an eSports title. "Overwatch"s progression into eSports was described by "Rolling Stone" as a "strategy [that] involved carefully rolling out the game in steps – first a closed beta, then open beta, then full release, then a competitive mode and finally a league."
In June 2016, the esports organizer ESL announced that they would host the first international "Overwatch" competition in August 2016, called "Overwatch" Atlantic Showdown. The competition used four open qualifiers beginning in June, followed by regional qualifiers and then a final online qualifier. Eight teams then competed for a six-figure prize in the finals to be held at Gamescom 2016 from August 20–21. Turner Broadcasting's ELeague announced the first "Overwatch Open" tournament, starting in July 2016, with a total prize pool of $300,000, with plans to broadcast the finals on Turner's cable channel TBS in September 2016.
In August 2016, Blizzard announced their own "Overwatch" international tournament, allowing users to vote for teams to represent their nation or region. Over 3 million votes to decide national teams were cast. The inaugural "Overwatch" World Cup was watched by 100,000 people at BlizzCon 2016. The South Korean team won the tournament, defeating the Russian team in the final round.
In March 2017, Blizzard announced "Overwatch" World Cup 2017. The selection of national teams for the 2017 World Cup was different from 2016 in that participating nations were required to vote for an "Overwatch" World Cup National Committee. The National Committees were based upon nominations chosen by Blizzard; according to Blizzard, "analysts, coaches, statisticians, and other authorities" recommended rosters for all stages of the competition. Blizzard announced the 2017 World Cup participants in April. The 2017 World Cup experienced an issue with several players on the Chinese team being denied visas to enter the United States for the final round, causing four players on the team to be replaced by substitutes.
Format.
Prior tournaments.
The 2016 format had four qualifying tournaments to thin the field for the final tournament, while the 2017 and 2018 formats used an average skill rating of each country's top players to determine which countries qualified for the tournament. Qualified teams were divided into round-robin style groups – 4 groups in 2016, 8 in 2017, and 4 in 2018. In every year, teams that made it past the group stages moved on a single-elimination playoff bracket.
Current format.
The 2019 World Cup takes place across three stages: preliminary rounds, group stages, and playoffs. A country's national ranking was determined by a point-ranking system based on final placements in the previous World Cups. Any country wishing to participate is eligible to play in the preliminary rounds, a single-elimination, seeded bracket. The top five countries based on their national ranking did not have to play in the preliminary rounds and will have any automatic bye to the group stages. The seeding will be based on the national rankings, and the top five countries from the Preliminary Rounds will move on to the group stages.
The Group Stages took place on November 1, 2019. The ten countries competing in the group stages will be split evenly into two round-robin style groups. The top country from each group will move on to the semifinals, while the second- and third-placed countries in each group will move on to the quarterfinals. The knockout stage will take place the following day on November 2. The six teams that move on from the group stages will participate in a single-elimination playoff. The winner of the finals will be awarded a gold medal, while the loser will be awarded silver. The two teams that lost in their respective semifinals match will play each other for the bronze medal.
Broadcasting.
The World Cup is broadcast through live stream channels via the Twitch platform. Official live stream broadcast channels are provided in English, Chinese, Korean, French, Russian, German, Japanese, and Thai. Other languages are broadcast through community–run channels on the official Overwatch World Cup team page. Prior to the third edition of the event, Disney and Blizzard Entertainment announced a multiyear deal for coverage of Overwatch esports.
Awards.
An MVP award for the Final Round of the OWC has been awarded since the inaugural tournament in 2016.

Ukrainian decommunization laws

Ukrainian decommunization laws refer to four Ukrainian laws of 2015. These laws relate to decommunization as well as commemoration of Ukrainian history. Such laws have been referred to as "memory laws".
As a result of the law mandating the removal of communist-era monuments, and renaming places named after communist themes Ukraine's toponymy was radically altered and the face of whole cities changed. More than 51,493 streets, squares and "other facilities" have been renamed. Various major cities and many villages were renamed.
The laws have raised some concerns about freedom of speech, as well as international concerns that they honor some organizations and individuals that participated in the mass murder of Jews, Poles, and Communists during the Holocaust in Ukraine and massacres in Volhynia.
Passage.
Instrumental in drafting the laws were Ukrainian historian Volodymyr Viatrovych and politician Yuri Shukhevych. The laws passed on April 9, 2015 in the Verkhovna Rada with overwhelming support and were enacted by president Petro Poroshenko on May 15 that year. This started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. The laws were published in Holos Ukrayiny on 20 May 2015; this made them come into force officially the next day.
In May 2017, 46 Ukrainian MPs, mainly from the Opposition Bloc faction, appealed to the Constitutional Court of Ukraine to declare the laws unconstitutional. On 16 July 2019 this court upheld the laws.
Content.
The decommunization laws are composed of:
Controversy.
In Ukraine as well as abroad, some scholars have expressed concerns about freedom of speech and research with regard to the above laws, issuing an open letter to the President. Particularly problematic is Article 6 of Law 2538-1 on "Responsibility for violating the legislation on the status of the fighters for Ukrainian independence in the 20th century", which stipulates that: "Citizens of Ukraine, foreigners, and also stateless persons who publicly insult the people specified in article 1 of said Law harm the realization of the rights of the fighters for independence of Ukraine in the 20th century and will be held to account in accordance with Ukrainian law", and that: "The public denial of the fact of the legitimacy of the struggle for Ukrainian independence in the 20th century mocks the memory of the fighters for independence of Ukraine in the 20th century, insults the dignity of the Ukrainian people and is illegal”. Critics have argued that this law is attempting to "legislate history" and restricts free speech.
The 2538-1 law has also been controversial abroad, since some of the organizations and individuals that it is to be honoring are recognized as having participated in the mass murder of Jews, Poles, and Communists during the Holocaust in Ukraine and massacres in Volhynia. The law was also passed on the day of the Polish presidential visit to Ukraine, and has been described by Polish politician Tomasz Kalita as "a slap in the face". Former Polish Prime Minister Leszek Miller declared in a televised interview that OUN was responsible for mass murders of Poles, and challenged the Ukrainian law enforcement to persecute him. Ukrainian politician and president of the Ukrainian parliament Volodymyr Groysman, who visited Poland shortly afterward, stated that the law is not intended to be anti-Polish, and was intended to be anti-Soviet and anti-Nazi instead.
Effects on Ukraine.
As a result of the law mandating the removal of communist-era monuments, and renaming places named after communist themes Ukraine's toponymy was radically altered and the face of whole cities has been changed. All in all more than 51,493 streets, squares and "other facilities" have been renamed. By June 2016 there were renamed 19 raions, 27 urban districts, 29 cities, 48 urban-type settlements, 119 rural settlements and 711 villages. The fourth largest city was renamed from Dnipropetrovsk to Dnipro. In the second-largest city of Ukraine, Kharkiv, more than 200 streets, 5 administrative raions, 4 parks and 1 metro station had been renamed by early February 2016. In all of 2016 51,493 streets and 987 cities and villages were renamed, 25 raions were renamed and 1,320 Lenin monuments and 1,069 monuments to other communist figures removed. In some villages Lenin statues were remade into "non-communist historical figures" to save money. Two Lenin statues in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone are the only two remaining statues of Lenin in Ukraine.
On 24 July 2015, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry used the law to strip the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Communist Party of Ukraine (renewed) and the Communist Party of Workers and Peasants of their right to participate in elections and stated it was continuing the court actions that started in July 2014 to end the registration of Ukraine's communist parties. By 16 December 2015, these three parties were banned in Ukraine. However, the Communist Party of Ukraine appealed the ban, which consequently failed to come into force. Later, the April 2015 decommunization law no. 2558 allows the Ministry of Justice to prohibit the Communist Party from participating in elections. The Central Election Commission of Ukraine prohibited the candidacy of Petro Symonenko for the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election due to the fact that the statute, name and symbolism of his party, the Communist Party of Ukraine, did not comply with the 2015 decommunization laws.
Late March 2019 former members of armed units of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, former Ukrainian Insurgent Army members and former members of the Polissian Sich/Ukrainian People's Revolutionary Army (and members of the Ukrainian Military Organization and Carpathian Sich soldiers) were officially granted the status of veterans. This meant that for the first time they could receive veteran benefits, including free public transport, subsidized medical services, annual monetary aid, and public utilities discounts (and will enjoy the same social benefits as former Ukrainian soldiers Red Army of the Soviet Union). (There had been several previous attempts to provide former Ukrainian nationalist fighters with official veteran status, especially during the 2005-2009 administration President Viktor Yushenko, but all failed.

Kat (Gravity Rush)

Kat, known in Japan as Kitten, is a fictional character and the protagonist of the "Gravity Rush" series. A young woman with retrograde amnesia, she awakens in the city of Hekseville after falling from the sky, and sets out to discover the origins of her power to shift gravity. She becomes a hero to the people of the city after defending them from the threat of mysterious creatures called the Nevi. Her powers stem entirely from Dusty, a supernatural, cat-like organism that is bound to her, and whom she later realizes is a type of being known as a Guardian. Kat has received critical praise for the unique nature of her powers, leading to inventive gameplay scenarios, as well as her optimistic personality, which has been noted to set her apart from typical superheroes.
Characteristics.
Kat is a young woman with tan skin, red eyes, and blonde hair. She wears a black romper held on her body by elastic, decorative pieces of gold metal. She also wears a cape-like scarf on her back, a matching headband, and two bracers, as well as tall socks with gold high heels.
Kat initially awakens after falling out of the sky and landing in a small playground in Hekseville, a city that is suspended in midair and attached to a massive vertical stone pillar called the World Pillar. Realizing she has amnesia, she sets out to look for the origins of her gravity shifting powers and begins helping people in Hekseville. Eventually she discovers the threat of the Nevi, mysterious interdimensional creatures that begin attacking the citizens of Hekseville, and becomes the city's defender, the "Gravity Queen". She comes into conflict with Raven, a fellow gravity shifter of unknown origin, who later becomes her close friend and ally.
In "Gravity Rush 2", Kat is taken through a portal into another universe, that of Jirga Para Lhao. She finally escapes and goes back to Hekseville, where she saves the city yet again. Climbing the World Pillar, she discovers that she is actually Queen Alua, the ruler of a lost civilization called Eto, but an advisor named Xicero attempted to murder her for wanting to save the city below from an oncoming black hole that marks the world's destruction and rebirth. She eventually escapes and returns to Hekseville, where she saves the city a final time from a dark force that has merged with the current ruler of Eto, an evil gravity-shifting child named Cai. She seals away the black hole, presumably perishing in the process, but she is hinted at being alive in the ending.
Reception.
Ludwig Kietzmann of GamesRadar+ stated that he liked the character of Kat, calling her an "exuberant girl in a scarf" that stood in contrast to most superheroes, who were a "tortured dude in a cape". He also praised how she was a "delightful klutz", which tied into the game's initially imprecise controls. Stating "there's an art to being utterly graceless in "Gravity Rush"", he stated that he imagined her apologizing to the people caught up in her gravity powers as she passed by and said that "Kat's optimism in the face of her innate clumsiness is what makes her special".
Steven Strom of Paste Magazine stated that while Kat's amnesia was clichéd, it freed her from the typical superhero origin story and established that she helped people due to her natural empathy rather than a past tragedy that befell her. He called what Kat does with her powers "endearing", since she uses them for "smaller, kinder acts of heroism", "literally gain[ing] a wider perspective on the world".
Twinfinite called Kat the runner up for best video game character of 2017, saying "I'm pretty sure it's physically impossible to dislike Kat", and calling her "one of the most charming and believably optimistic characters you'll ever come across in video games. Zhiquing Wan of the same website called "Gravity Rush 2" "one of the most compelling stories of a protagonist just looking for something - anything at all - that vaguely resembles a home".
Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku called Kat not "exactly the ideal heroine", citing her penchant for collateral damage and calling her an "accidental mass-murderer".
Patrick Klepek and Austin Walker of VICE stated that, in "Gravity Rush 2", while Kat is initially a "cheery optimist" who assumes the best in people and is easy to fool, she gradually has her eyes opened to the inequality of Jirga Para Lhao and must become less naive to take on the oppressive Council that controls it. Klepek called one of his favorite moments in the game the choice to let Kat decide whether to deliver a barrel of fuel to the wealthy upper residents, or instead violate her orders and assist the poor lower denizens.

2018 Zlín by-election

A by-election for the Zlín Senate seat in the Czech Republic was held on 18 and 19 May 2018 as a result of František Čuba's resignation. The second round was heldr 25 and 26 May 2018. Michaela Blahová and Tomáš Goláň advanced to second round. The election was surprisingly won by Tomáš Goláň. Voter turnout was very low.
Background.
František Čuba was elected Senator in 2014 as a candidate of the Party of Civic Rights. He was absent in the Seate since 2016 due to his health. He announced on 15 February 2018 that he will resign on his seat. He resigned on 28 February 2018.
Parties started to look for its candidates soon after Čuba announced his intention to resign. ANO 2011 had its candidate chosen at the time of Čuba's resignation but refused to announce his name. Civic Democratic Party was considering possible candidates at the time. Mayors and Independents offered nomination to Mayor of Zlín Miroslav Adámek. Michaela Blahová was speculated as a candidate of the Christian and Democratic Union – Czechoslovak People's Party. Czech Social Democratic Party expressed intention to have its candidate. Czech Pirate Party decided to find a candidate by publishing an advertisement in local media. Tomáš Goláň announced his candidacy as a candidate of Senátor 21 on 22 March 2018. He stated he wants to prove that Senate is an important part of Czech Constitutional system.
Nine candidates decided to run for the position. Miroslav Adámek was nominated by Mayors and Independents and supported by the Civic Democratic Party and TOP 09. Other candidates included Michaela Blahová nominated by KDU-ČSL, Michal Filip nominated by ANO 2011, Tomáš Goláň nominated by Senátor 21 or Radim Jünger nominated by ČSSD.
Campaign.
First Round.
Miroslav Adámek was considered front-runner of the election. Michal Filip and Michaela Blahová were considered his main rivals. Tomáš Goláň was also viewed as a strong candidate.
Adámek's campaign cost 300,000 CZK. He published a video spot that received mixed responses and had 15 billboards set up. He refused to have meetings with voters.
Goláň had the most expensive campaign. He had installed 17 billboards and three megaboards. His posters were also on 20 Trolleybuses and three Ticket Autommats. He held summer cinema at Čepkovo. Goláň himself was very active at social media.
Blahová focused on personal campaigning and social media. She also had posters at three bigboards, 50 yachts and 12 billboards.
The first round was held on 18 and 19 May 2018. Michaela Blahová and Tomáš Goláň advanced to second round. Goláň's success was unexpected. Miroslav Adámek admitted that he feels disappointment with his result but accepts it. Michaela Blahová stated that her success might be caused by the fact that she was the only female candidate in the election. She noted she will continue personal campaign. Goláň stated that his advancement to the second round was caused by jis campaign. He noted he will lead more intensive campaign for the second round. Communist Party candidate Rafaja admitted he is disappointed with the result as he expected that he could advance to the second round. Aleš Fuksa thanked Pirate Party for its support.
Second round.
Blahová visited bigger towns within the district. It includes Valašské Klobouky, Fryšták or Slušovice. Her campaign was supported by Pavel Fischer. Goláň also led personal campaign in bigger towns. He visited Fryšták, Vizovice, Slušovice, Valašské Klobouky or Zlín. He focused on voters of Miroslav Adámek and Aleš Fuksa. Goláň received endorsement from the Pirate Party. He launched second phase of his campaign on 24 May when he campaigned in Zlín. He concluded his campaign on 25 May when he met citizens at Baťa's institute.
Second round was held on 25 and 26 May 2018. First preliminary results showed candidates tied but Goláň started leading when more votes were counted. Goláň's supporters started celebrating when 70% of votes were counted and Goláň was leading. He eventually received 5,991 votes while Blahová only 5,148.
Aftermath.
Goláň thanked Blahová for a correct campaign and stated he plans to focus on taxes and opposition to privatisation of some vital resources, including water. Blahová stated she respects the result. She considered her result as a success because no candidate of KDU-ČSL advanced to the second round in previous elections.
Goláň received appointment decree on 19 June 2018. His term ended in 2020. Goláň's victory led to establishment of a new Senate Caucus called Caucus for Liberal Democracy. It consists of independent Senators. He was reelected in 2020 Senate election defeating Pavel Stodůlka with 59% of votes. He then joined the Civic Democratic Party.

Cello Sonata No. 2 (Fauré)

The Cello Sonata No. 2 in G minor, Op. 117 is the second of the two cello sonatas by Gabriel Fauré.
In early 1921 Fauré had been commissioned by the French government to write a funeral march for a ceremony to be held on 5 May at Les Invalides to mark the 100th anniversary of the death of Napoleon. The sombre theme he composed for it remained in his mind and, as he said, "turned itself into a sonata". By then the composer was frail, and his ill health delayed the completion of the outer movements until late in the year. On 10 November Fauré wrote to his friend and benefactor Charles Martin Loeffler asking him to accept the dedication of the cello sonata, which he had completed that same day.
The work was premiered on 13 May 1922 at a concert of the Société Nationale de Musique, by the cellist Gérard Hekking and the pianist Alfred Cortot, who had been the performers at the premiere of Fauré's First Cello Sonata five years earlier.
Structure.
The first movement, in G minor in 3/4 time, is in sonata form. It opens with a piano melody with syncopated accompaniment, immediately echoed by the cello. The critic Nicolas Southon comments that the movement "combines a simmering sensitivity with skilful canonic writing", which Fauré "seems to use just for the pleasure of it". After a secondary element, introduced by a descending seventh, the second subject is a "piano cantando" of themes and motifs that are used to form the development. In the recapitulation the first subject returns with the roles of the parts reversed: the cello takes the lead, with the piano closely shadowing it. The movement ends in G major.
The slow movement, in E flat in 4/4 time, is a transcription of the "Chant funéraire" written to mark the centenary of Napoleon's death. The critic Roger Nichols comments, "In the measured repeated chords of the accompaniment and the long majestic cello lines it looks back to the successful "Élégie", now coloured with more enigmatic harmonies". The Fauré scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux writes that although there is less pathos in this movement than in the "Élégie", there is no less nobility. In his view, the second theme, in A flat major, "gives a good idea of how far Fauré had come since 1880". He notes that the chorale-like theme, centred on the dominant E flat, has its intensity increased when the piano repeats it and makes a sudden modulation to the distant key of B minor. Nectoux finds that this strikes "a note of tragedy rare in the works of a composer who is more usually concerned to express tenderness, contentment or seductiveness". At the climax of the movement the two main themes are combined, and after a brief recapitulation the Andante ends calmly, in C major.
The concluding movement, in G minor in 2/4 time, serves the function of both scherzo and finale. It opens with an ascending theme for the piano, answered by the cello with a descending scale. The first main theme is a syncopated tune that Nichols calls "almost jazzy". The piano introduces a new chordal theme marked "sans ralentir" in simple four-part harmony. The expected return of the first theme becomes instead a contrasting section with the piano in divided octaves, and the cello in pizzicato chords and repeated notes. Nichols comments that the piano is "the leader of things harmonic, while the cello rides imperiously over all its eccentricities". The two main themes of the movement are further developed before the final coda, described by Nectoux as "a burst of the highest spirits".
The playing time of the sonata is about twenty minutes.

Trump tariffs

The Trump tariffs are a series of United States tariffs imposed during the presidency of Donald Trump as part of his "America First" economic policy to reduce the United States trade deficit by shifting American trade policy from multilateral free trade agreements to bilateral trade deals. In January 2018, Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines of 30 to 50 percent. In March 2018, he imposed tariffs on steel (25%) and aluminum (10%) from most countries, which, according to Morgan Stanley, covered an estimated 4.1 percent of U.S. imports. In June 2018, this was extended to the European Union, Canada, and Mexico. In separate moves, the Trump administration has set and escalated tariffs on goods imported from China, leading to a trade war.
The tariffs angered trading partners, who implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. In June 2018, India planned to recoup trade penalties of $241 million on $1.2 billion worth of Indian steel and aluminum, but attempted talks delayed these until June 2019 when India imposed retaliatory tariffs on $240 million worth of U.S. goods. Canada imposed matching retaliatory tariffs on July 1, 2018. China implemented retaliatory tariffs equivalent to the $34 billion tariff imposed on it by the U.S. In July 2018, the Trump administration announced it would use a Great Depression-era program, the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), to pay farmers up to $12 billion, increasing the aid to $28 billion in May 2019. The USDA estimated that aid payments constituted more one third of total farm income in 2019 and 2020.
Tariff negotiations in North America were relatively more successful, with the U.S. lifting the steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico on May 20, 2019, joining Australia and Argentina in being the only nations exempted from the regulations. However, on May 30, Trump unilaterally announced his intention to impose a five percent tariff on all imports from Mexico beginning on June 10, with tariffs increasing to ten percent on July1, and by another five percent each month for three months, "until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP," adding illegal immigration as a condition for U.S.-Mexico tariff negotiations. The move was seen as threatening the ratification of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), the North American trade deal set to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The tariffs were averted on June 7 after negotiations.
A May 2019 analysis conducted by CNBC found Trump's tariffs are equivalent to one of the largest tax increases in the U.S. in decades. Studies have found that Trump's tariffs reduced real income in the United States, as well as adversely affecting U.S. GDP. Studies have found that the tariffs adversely affected Republican candidates in elections.
Background.
Trump adopted his current views on trade issues in the 1980s, saying Japan and other nations were taking advantage of the United States. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly favored policy proposals that renegotiate trade agreements for the United States. During a meeting with the New York Times Editorial Board in January 2016, Trump said he would tax Chinese imports into the United States by 45%. Trump frequently criticized the North American Free Trade Agreement calling it "the worst trade deal the U.S. has ever signed". He also called Trans-Pacific Partnership "the death blow for American manufacturing" and said it would "put the interests of foreign countries above our own".
Policy.
On November 21, 2016, in a video message, Trump introduced an economic strategy of "putting America first", saying he would negotiate "fair, bilateral trade deals that bring jobs and industry back on to American shores". On January 23, 2017, three days after becoming president, Trump withdrew the United States from the politically divisive Trans-Pacific Partnership believing the agreement would "undermine" the U.S. economy and sovereignty.
Trump has also indicated a desire to end the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico. His administration has renegotiated the terms of the agreement. Trump had threatened to withdraw from it if negotiations fail. He has specifically criticized the Ford Motor Co., Carrier Corporation, and Mondelez International for having operations based in Mexico. In August 2015, in response to Oreo maker Mondelez International's announcement that it would move manufacturing to Mexico, Trump said he would boycott Oreos. The new deal increases the percentage of parts and manufacturing that must be done in North America for domestic automobiles, sets a minimum wage for some workers on auto parts, and expands access for U.S. dairy sales to Canada.
Similar to his approach to trade deals, Trump also pledged, as part of the Contract with the American Voter, to impose tariffs to discourage companies from laying off workers or relocating to other countries, through an "End the Offshoring Act". No such act has been introduced in Congress, but Trump has moved to impose tariffs on solar panels, washing machines, steel, and aluminum. The enforcement of the tariffs falls primarily within the purview of the Department of Commerce and Office of the United States Trade Representative.
Trump has repeatedly promised to lower America's trade deficit, and has argued for a renegotiation of trade deals and imposition of tariffs to that end. These efforts notwithstanding, during 2018 the trade deficit continued to increase.
In November 2018, Trump argued that the tariffs enriched the United States. He said the United States was gaining "Billions of Dollars" from "Tariffs being charged to China". He added, "If companies don't want to pay Tariffs, build in the U.S.A. Otherwise, let's just make our Country richer than ever before!" Fact-checkers and economists described the assertions made by Trump as false, with the Associated Press writing "Almost all economists say the president is wrong. That's because tariffs are taxes on imports. They can cause higher prices, reduce trade among countries and hurt overall economic growth as a result."
Legality.
Article1, Section8 of the Constitution: "Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises." But Congress has repeatedly shifted its powers regarding tariffs to the president. Beginning in 1917 with the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917 the president can impose any tariff while the nation is at war. The affected trade does not have to be connected to the ongoing war. Since 1974 the Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to impose a 15% tariff for 150 days if there is "an adverse impact on national security from imports." After 150 days the tariff expires unless extended by Congress. In 1977 the International Emergency Economic Powers Act shifted powers even more towards the White House. The Trump administration claims that it gives the President the authority to raise tariffs without any limits during a national emergency of any kind. Legal scholars disagree because the IEEPA does not mention tariffs at all and transfers no authority of tariffs towards the President.
Enacted.
Solar panels.
On January 23, 2018, news outlets announced that Trump had imposed tariffs on solar panels produced outside the United States. The tariffs initially start at 30% and will gradually fall to 15% in four years. The first 2.5 gigawatts of solar cells imported each year will be exempted from the tariff.
China is currently the world leader in solar panel manufacture, and has decried the tariffs. Zhong Shan, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said in a statement, "With regard to the wrong measures taken by the United States, China will work with other W.T.O. members to resolutely defend our legitimate interests."
Washing machines.
On January 23, 2018, in conjunction with the tariffs placed on solar panels, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative announced tariffs on washing machines. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), imports of large residential washers increased "steadily" from 2012 to 2016, and domestic producers' financial performance "declined precipitously". In the first year, the tariffs start at 20% for the first 1.2 million units of imported finished washers, and all subsequent washers within that year will have a 50% tariff. By the third year initial tariff will go down to 16-40%, following the same pattern.
The tariffs came after a petition was filed by Whirlpool, a U.S.-based washing machine manufacturer facing tough competition from LG Electronics and Samsung, which are both based in South Korea.
In 2016, China exported $425 million worth of washers to the United States, followed by Mexico with $240 million, and South Korean companies $130 million. Samsung and LG are among the top exporters of washers to the United States. Two weeks before the tariff announcement, Samsung had moved its production of washing machines to a new plant in South Carolina. In response Samsung said U.S. consumers will "pay more, with fewer choices". Mexican officials said they would respond to the tariffs during the ongoing NAFTA renegotiations.
Steel and aluminum.
On March 1, 2018, Trump announced his intention to impose a 25% tariff on steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports. In a tweet the next day, Trump asserted, "Trade wars are good, and easy to win." On March 8, he signed an order to impose the tariffs effective after 15 days. The EU, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, Brazil and South Korea were temporarily exempted from the order under a carve-out provision. Canada, Mexico, and the EU became subject to the steel and aluminium tariffs later in an announcement on May 31, 2018. The U.S., Canada, and Mexico would reach a deal to remove the steel and aluminum tariffs in May 2019, almost a year after going into effect.
In December 2019, Trump tweeted that he would impose tariffs on Brazilian and Argentine metals, effective immediately, alleging the countries were manipulating their currencies to make their products more attractive in global markets. Economists disagreed the countries were devaluing their currencies, attributing the declines to global market forces. After speaking with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Trump days later backed down from his threat against Brazil, but made no mention of Argentina.
Permanent steel exemption.
While the 25% steel tariff as a rule applies to all countries worldwide, four countries have successfully negotiated a permanent exemption from it. Australian prime minister Malcolm Turnbull successfully lobbied President Trump to get an exemption at the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit, arguing "[w]e do this steel that's specialty steel. We're the only one that produces it in the world. You've got to let us out. You've got a $40 billion trade surplus with us. We're military allies with you. We're in every battle with you." However, On December 2, 2019, President Donald Trump reinstated steel and aluminium tariffs against Brazil, later backed down, and Argentina.
Legal basis and challenges.
The legal basis cited in Trump's tariff order is Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which under certain circumstances allows the president to impose tariffs based on the recommendation from the U.S. Secretary of Commerce if "an article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such circumstances as to threaten or impair the national security." This section is rarely used, and has never been invoked since the World Trade Organization was established in 1995.
China initiated a WTO complaint against the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs on April 9, 2018. The EU opened a similar WTO case on June 1, 2018.
On June 9, 2018, Trump tweeted a statement addressing Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau in which he said American tariffs targeting Canada "are in response to his [tariffs] of 270% on dairy!" In the tweet, Trump did not cite national security, the legal basis for implementing the tariff.
Economic and trade analysis.
A survey of leading economists by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business showed a consensus that imposing new U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum will not improve Americans' welfare. Economists say the tariffs will lead to more harm than gains, as the price for steel increases, which will harm consumers and Americans working in manufacturing industries that use steel (these jobs outnumber those who work in steel-producing sectors by 80 to 1). The big winners of the tariffs are some American steel- and aluminum-producing industries; some of the producers (especially small- and middle-sized ones) who are reliant on foreign inputs may struggle as a result of the tariffs. A study of the proposal indicated that it would lead to an estimated loss of 146,000 jobs. Studies of the 2002 steel tariffs enacted by the Bush administration show that they caused more job losses than job gains. Jobs losses could be even greater if other countries retaliate against the United States with their own tariffs on various American products.
Scholars warned that the Trump administration's use of "national security" rationales (these have not been commonly used by past administrations) for the tariffs could undermine the international trading order, as other states could use the same rationales for their own tariffs. The WTO allows states to take actions necessary to ensure their national security, but this provision has been sparsely used, given that it could be abused. Whereas national security reasons were cited for the tariffs, it has been noted that tariffs primarily harm American allies, not enemies; the United States imports very little steel and aluminum from China directly. Trade experts furthermore noted that the United States already produces more than two-thirds of its own steel.
Forty-five U.S. trade associations are urging Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be "particularly harmful" to the U.S. economy and consumers.
The National Retail Federation has been vocal in its opposition of the tariffs. The NRF also launched an ad campaign with Ben Stein, who reprised his role as the economics teacher from "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" arguing that tariffs are bad economics and hurt consumers.
General Motors announced closure of plants in Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, and Ontario, and cutting over 14,000 jobs, citing steel tariffs as a factor. Trump expressed frustration with the decision.
Domestic political response.
Domestically, reactions from elected officials often varied among regional lines rather than ideological lines. The tariffs have seen widespread criticism from conservatives and Republicans. However, the Republican-controlled Congress has thus far declined to take any action to counter Trump's imposition of tariffs. Speaker Paul Ryan said Congress would not pass any tariff legislation that Trump would veto.
Reception was mixed among Democratic officials, with Democrats from Rust Belt states voicing support for tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.
The AFL-CIO, the largest labor union in the U.S., praised Trump for the tariffs, as did Democratic Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, who said the action would be a boon for "steel plants across Ohio". Many congressional Republicans expressed fear that the tariffs might damage the economy or lead to retaliatory tariffs from other countries. Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell urged Trump to rethink his proposal or to target the tariffs more narrowly so as to avoid "unintended consequences and collateral damage". House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, while calling for strategic and targeted actions against "trade cheaters," criticized Trump's rollout of the tariffs, calling it "chaotic" and saying it was "maximizing the collateral damage to American workers, consumers and our international alliances". The proposal drew comparisons to a tariff imposed by his Republican presidential predecessor, George W. Bush; in 2002 the U.S. imposed heavy steel tariffs that were largely seen as ineffectual or even harmful to the U.S., and were withdrawn after 18 months.
On March 6, 2018, Gary Cohn, chair of the National Economic Council, announced his intention to resign; the announcement followed Trump's cancellation of a meeting with end-users of steel and aluminum that Cohn had arranged in an attempt to dissuade the president from the planned tariffs.
A March 2018 Quinnipiac University poll showed widespread disapproval of the tariffs, with only 29% of Americans agreeing with a "25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports" if it raised their cost of living.
On June 13, 2019, 661 American companies sent a letter to Trump urging him to resolve the trade dispute with China. The letter was one of many sent on behalf of Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, an organization of over 150 trade groups representing agriculture, manufacturing, retailing and technology companies.
Lifting.
On May 17, 2019, the U.S. reached a deal to lift the steel and aluminum tariffs on Mexico and Canada. Lifting the tariffs were seen as helping pave the way for further ratification of the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement. According to a joint statement, the Canadian and the U.S. governments said the U.S. will scrap the metals duties within two days of the deal. Canada will remove tariffs levied on American goods in retaliation for the steel and aluminum duties. The countries will also drop all pending litigation in the World Trade Organization related to the tariffs, set up measures to "prevent the importation of aluminum or steel that is unfairly subsidized and/or sold at dumped prices" and "prevent the transshipment of aluminum and steel made outside of Canada or the United States to the other country" and make an "agreed-upon process for monitoring aluminum and steel trade between them". In a separate statement, the Mexican government also said it would remove retaliatory tariffs it put on the U.S. and cease pending litigation. Mexico also said it would set up measures to stop unfair trade practices in the aluminum and steel markets and to monitor trade of the metals in North America.
Along with the deal with Canada and Mexico, President Trump also postponed a decision on whether to impose tariffs on automobiles imported from Europe, Japan and other countries for six months.
Chinese products.
On March 22, 2018, Trump signed a memorandum under the Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, instructing the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to apply tariffs of $50 billion on Chinese goods. Trump said the tariffs would be imposed due to Chinese theft of U.S intellectual property. Trump said his planned tariffs on Chinese imports would make the United States "a much stronger, much richer nation". However, the steps toward imposing the tariffs led to increased concerns of a global trade war.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 724 points, or 2.9%, after the tariffs were announced due to concerns over a trade war. Corporations that traded with China, such as Caterpillar Inc.and Boeing, suffered large losses in their stock price.
In response, the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China announced plans to implement its own tariffs on 128 U.S. products. 120 of those products, such as fruit and wine, will be taxed at a 15% duty while the remaining eight products, including pork, will receive a 25% tariff. China implemented their tariffs on April 2, 2018.
On April 3, 2018, the U.S. Trade Representative's office published an initial list of 1,300+ Chinese goods to impose levies upon, including products like flat-screen televisions, weapons, satellites, medical devices, aircraft parts and batteries. Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai responded by warning the U.S. that they may fight back, saying "We have done the utmost to avoid this kind of situation, but if the other side makes the wrong choice, then we have no alternative but to fight back."
On April 4, 2018, China's Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council decided to announce a plan of additional tariffs of 25% on 106 items of products including automobiles, airplanes, and soybeans. Soybeans are the top U.S. agricultural export to China.
The increased tit-for-tat tariff announcements stoked fears that the two countries are inching closer to a trade war. On April 4, 2018, President Trump responded to speculation tweeting: "We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!" The next day Trump directed the USTR to consider $100 billion in additional tariffs.
On May 9, 2018, China cancelled soybean orders exported from United States to China. Zhang Xiaoping, Chinese director for the U.S. Soybean Export Council, said Chinese buyers simply stopped buying from the U.S.
On June 15, Donald Trump released a list of $34 billion of Chinese goods to face a 25% tariff, starting on July6. Another list with $16 billion of Chinese goods was released, with an implementation date of August 23.
On July 10, the United States Trade Representative, in reaction to China's retaliatory tariffs that took effect July6, requested comments, gave notice of public hearings and issued a proposed list of Chinese products amounting to an annual trade value of about $200 billion that would be subjected to an additional 10% in duties on top of what those imported articles would normally pay.
In 2018 China ended its domestic ownership rules for auto companies and financial institutions. The rules required that auto companies and financial institutions in China be at least 50 percent owned by Chinese companies. The change was seen as benefitting U.S. auto companies including Tesla.
On May 9, 2019, Trump said the tariffs are "paid for mostly by China, by the way, not by us." Economic analysts concluded this was an incorrect assertion as American businesses and consumers ultimately pay the tariffs as real-world examples of tariffs working as intended are rare, and consumers of the tariff-levying country are the primary victims of tariffs, by having to pay higher prices. "It is inaccurate to say that countries pay tariffs on commercial and consumer goods—it is the buyers and sellers that bear the costs," said Ross Burkhart, a Boise State University political scientist. "Purchasers pay the tariff when they buy popular products. Sellers lose market share when their products get priced out of markets," Burkhart added.
During the June 2019 G20 Osaka summit, China and America agreed to resume stalled trade talks, with Trump announcing he would suspend an additional $300 billion in tariffs that had been under consideration after talks failed the previous month, and asserting China had agreed to buy a "tremendous amount" of American farm products, although there were no specifics or confirmation of this by China. People familiar with the negotiations later said China made no explicit commitment as Trump had described.
South Korean products.
On March 28, 2018 the United States and South Korea announced major changes to the bilateral United States–Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) in response to the numerous tariffs and the proposed North Korean-United States diplomatic meeting. The 25 percent tariff on South Korean trucks will be extended until 2041, adding twenty years to the current 2021 target phase out date. No South Korean auto manufacturer exports trucks to the United States. The United States exempted South Korea from its steel tariffs, but imposed an import quota of about 2.68 million tonnes. South Korea was temporarily exempted from aluminum tariffs as well, but the exemption was removed effective May 1, 2018.
Retaliatory tariffs.
China, Canada, and the European Union responded negatively to the initial announcement (which did not mention any temporary exemptions). Canada supplies 16% of U.S. demand for steel, followed by Brazil at 13%, South Korea at 10%, Mexico at 9%, and China at 2%.
Canadian.
From 2013 to 2016, Canada was the largest source of aluminum imports to the U.S.
Trump invoked national security grounds as justification for imposing steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the idea "that Canada could be considered a national security risk to the United States" was "absurd" and "inconceivable" and called the tariffs "totally unacceptable." Trudeau announced $16.6 billion in retaliatory tariffs, saying "American people are not the target... We hope eventually that common sense will triumph. Unfortunately the actions taken today by the United States government do not appear headed in that direction."
On July 1, 2018, Canada implemented retaliatory tariffs on U.S. imports. The value of the Canadian tariffs were set to match the value of the U.S. tariffs dollar-for-dollar and cover 299 U.S. goods, including steel, aluminum, and a variety of other products, including inflatable boats, yogurt, whiskies, candles, and sleeping bags before the tariffs were lifted on May 20, 2019.
Chinese.
The Chinese government placed retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. China threatened to curb imports of U.S. soybeans.
A June 2019 analysis conducted by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China had imposed the same 8% average tariffs on all countries in January 2018, but by June 2019 average tariffs on American exports had increased to 20.7% while those on other countries had declined to 6.7%
European.
Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, condemned U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs and announced that a legal challenge at the World Trade Organization would follow. The EU filed the WTO challenge against the United States on June 1, once the tariffs took effect.
Retaliatory tariffs from the European Union took effect on June 22, 2018, imposing tariffs on 180 types of products, in total worth over $3 billion of U.S. goods. Affected products include steel and aluminum, agricultural goods (including orange juice and cranberry juice), clothing, washing machines, cosmetics, and boats. European Commissioner for Trade Cecilia Malmström stated: "The rules of international trade, which we have developed... with our American partners, cannot be violated without a reaction from our side. Our response is measured, proportionate and fully in line with WTO rules." Among the U.S. manufacturers affected by the EU's responsive tariffs is Harley-Davidson, which announced that it would move some of their manufacturing out of the United States. Another is the James E. Pepper whiskey distillery in Kentucky, which, due to raised prices, lost most of its foreign business; as of mid-2021, the business had not recovered.
The ongoing conflict between American aircraft manufacturer Boeing and European manufacturer Airbus over government subsidies had been going on for more than two decades. After the World Trade Organization gave the U.S. a green light to impose tariffs because of subsidies from the governments of Spain, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom to Airbus, European Commission spokesperson Daniel Rosario threatened retaliatory measures if the United States imposes a US$7.5 billion (€6.823 billion) tariff on products such as olives, whiskey, wine, cheese, yogurt, and airplanes. The tariffs were in addition to those imposed in 2018. they are in effect.
Indian.
On June 16, 2019, India imposed retaliatory tariffs on 28 U.S. products, $240 million worth of goods, with some levies reaching 70 percent. Affected products include apples, almonds, walnuts, lentils, and some chemical products; India is the largest buyer of U.S. almonds, paying $543 million for more than half of the imports. It's also the second-largest buyer of U.S. apples, buying $156 million worth in 2018. The tariffs were in response to the U.S.'s refusal to exempt India from higher tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and in response to the U.S. withdrawing India from the Generalized System of Preferences on June 5. India had announced retaliatory tariff increases totaling $235 million on U.S. goods in June 2018, but trade talks had delayed their implementation.
Mexican.
In response to the imposition of U.S. tariffs, Mexico implemented retaliatory tariffs on around US$3 billion (MXN $58.6 billion) worth of U.S. goods. These Mexican tariffs, which went into effect on June 5, 2018 were imposed on U.S. steel, pork, cheese, whiskey, and apples, among other goods before being lifted on May 20, 2019.
Proposed.
Automobiles.
During his presidential campaign, Trump said he would impose tariffs—between 15 and 35%—on companies that moved their operations to Mexico. Trump proposed a 35% tariff on "every car, every truck and every part manufactured in Ford's Mexico plant that comes across the border". Tariffs at that level would be far higher than the international norms (which are around 2.67% for the U.S. and most other advanced economies and under 10% for most developing countries). After the European Union threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs should a tariff on steel and aluminum be imposed, on March 3, 2018 Trump countered with a threat to impose tariffs on European car manufacturers. In May 2019, Trump threatened to impose tariffs of up to 25 percent on automobiles and parts on the basis that a weakening internal U.S. economy constituted a national security threat, but delayed the imposition of the tariffs for six months to allow for trade talks with the European Union and Japan.
All Mexican imports.
On May 30, 2019, Trump unexpectedly announced that he would impose a 5% tariff on all imports from Mexico on June 10, increasing to 10% on July 1, and by another 5% each month for three months, "until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP." Hours later, Republican senator Chuck Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, commented, "This is a misuse of presidential tariff authority and counter to congressional intent. Following through on this threat would seriously jeopardize passage of USMCA, a central campaign pledge of President Trump's and what could be a big victory for the country." That same day, the Trump administration formally initiated the process to seek congressional approval of USMCA. Trump's top trade advisor, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, opposed the new Mexican tariffs on concerns it would jeopardize passage of USMCA. Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trump senior advisor Jared Kushner also opposed the action. Grassley, whose committee is instrumental in passing USMCA, was not informed in advance of Trump's surprise announcement. An array of lawmakers and business groups expressed consternation about the proposed tariffs. With 2018 imports of Mexican goods totaling $346.5 billion, a 5% tariff constitutes a tax increase of over $17 billion.
On the evening of June7, Trump announced that the planned Mexico tariffs were "indefinitely suspended" after Mexico agreed to take stronger measures to curb immigration across the border of the U.S. According to the deal, Mexico agreed to deploy 6,000 of its National Guard troops throughout the country, with a focus on its southern border with Guatemala. Mexico also agreed to house migrants seeking asylum in the U.S.—including housing, offering jobs, health care and education—while the U.S. agreed to accelerate asylum claims. If the deal does not have the "expected results," then the two nations will meet again in 90 days. Trump also tweeted that Mexico had agreed to "immediately" begin buying agricultural products from U.S. farmers, although the communique between the countries did not mention any such deal and Mexican officials were reportedly not aware of such discussions; American officials declined to comment. "The New York Times" reported the next day that Mexico had already agreed to most of the actions months prior. On June 9, as critics continued to downplay the significance of the deal, Trump called "The New York Times" report "false", tweeting "We have been trying to get some of these Border Actions for a long time... but were not able to get them, or get them in full, until our signed agreement with Mexico." The "Times" stood by its reporting. Trump also threatened that he could return to using tariffs as a tactic if desired. Mexico's ambassador to the U.S., Martha Bárcena Coqui, addressed Trump's defense of the deal on CBS, saying "There are a lot of details that we discussed during the negotiations... that we didn't put into the declaration because there are different paths that we have to follow," adding that adjustments will be made as the situation on the border evolves.
Effects.
The Trump administration's tariffs were received negatively by the majority of economists and analysts, with general consensus among experts—including U.S. Director of the National Economic Council Larry Kudlow—being that the tariffs either have no direct benefits on the U.S. economy and GDP growth or they have a small to moderately negative impact on the economy. In a March 2018 Reuters survey, almost 80% of 60 economists believed the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports would be a net harm to the U.S. economy, with the rest believing the tariffs would have little or no effect; none of the economists surveyed believed the tariffs would benefit the U.S. economy. In May 2018, more than 1,000 economists wrote a letter warning Trump about the dangers of pursuing a trade war, arguing that the tariffs were echoing policy errors, such as the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which helped lead to the Great Depression.
Economic.
A study published in fall 2019 in the "Journal of Economic Perspectives" found that by December 2018, Trump's tariffs resulted in a reduction in aggregate U.S. real income of $1.4 billion per month in deadweight losses, and cost U.S. consumers an additional $3.2 billion per month in added tax. The study's authors noted that these were conservative measures of the losses from the tariffs, because they did not take account of the tariffs' effects in reducing the variety of products available to consumers, or the tariff-related costs attributable to policy uncertainty or the fixed costs incurred by companies to reorganize their global supply chains. A study by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the tariffs reduced employment in the American manufacturing sector.
An April 2019 working paper by economists found that the tariffs on washing machines caused the prices of washers to increase by approximately twelve percent in the United States. A 2019 paper by Federal Reserve Board economists found that the steel tariffs led to 0.6% fewer jobs in the manufacturing sector than would have happened in the absence of the tariffs; this amounted to approximately 75,000 jobs.
In May 2019, analyses from varying organizations were released. A May 2019 Goldman Sachs analysis found that the consumer price index (CPI) for tariffed goods had increased dramatically, compared to a declining CPI for all other core goods. A CNBC analysis that month found that Trump had "enacted tariffs equivalent to one of the largest tax increases in decades," while Tax Foundation and Tax Policy Center analyses found the tariffs could offset the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 for many households. The Tax Foundation found that if all existing and proposed tariffs were fully implemented, the benefits of the Trump tax cut would be completely eliminated for all taxpayers through the 90th percentile in earnings. Another May 2019 analysis conducted by the National Taxpayers Union warned that the existing and proposed additional tariffs, if fully implemented, would constitute the largest tax increase of the post-war era. According to an analysis by Peterson Institute for International Economics economists, American businesses and consumers paid more than $900,000 a year for each job that was created or saved as a result of the Trump administration's tariffs on steel and aluminum. The cost for each job saved as a result of the administration's tariffs on washing machines was $815,000.
Analysis conducted by Deutsche Bank estimated that Trump's trade actions had resulted in foregone American stock market capitalization of $5 trillion through May 2019.
Trump announced on August 1, 2019, that he would impose a 10% tariff on $300 billion of Chinese imports beginning September1; four days later the Chinese Commerce Ministry announced that China was halting imports of all American agricultural goods. American Farm Bureau Federation data showed that agriculture exports to China fell from $19.5 billion in 2017 to $9.1 billion in 2018, a 53% decline. The figure was $21.4 billion in 2016.
A September 2019 Federal Reserve study found that tariffs Trump imposed through mid-2019, combined with the policy uncertainty they created, would reduce the 2020 real GDP growth rate by one percentage point.
A study by four economists published in October 2019 by the "Quarterly Journal of Economics" estimated that U.S. consumers and firms who buy imports lost $51 billion (0.27% of GDP) as a result of the 2018 tariffs. After accounting for increases in government tariff revenue and gains to U.S. producers, the study authors estimated the aggregate U.S. real income loss to be $7.2 billion (0.04% of GDP). The study found that "retaliatory tariffs resulted in a 9.9% decline in U.S. exports within products." The study also found that workers in heavily Republican counties suffered the most from the trade war, because retaliatory tariffs focused on agricultural products.
Between the time Trump took office in 2017 through March 2019, the U.S.'s trade deficit grew by $119 billion, reaching $621 billion, the highest it had been since 2008. As of January 2020, the Trump administration had imposed tariffs on 16.8% of all goods imported into the U.S. (measured as a share of the value of all U.S. imports in 2017). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published its estimate of the U.S. economic impact from Trump's trade policies:
Political.
Studies have found that the tariffs also adversely affected Republican candidates in elections. A study by the University of Warwick's economists found that the tariffs negatively impacted the electorate in districts that swung to Trump (relative to Mitt Romney's 2012 performance), and that as a result of the retaliatory tariffs, Republican candidates fared worse by between 1.4 and 2.7 percentage points in counties in the top decile of the exposure distribution implied by the Chinese, Canadian and Mexican retaliation. The analysis also found that the retaliatory tariffs implemented by the EU were carefully structured so as to not harm the EU itself, whereas China implemented tariffs that harmed industries both in China and in the U.S. A 2021 study found that Chinese retaliatory tariffs systematically targeted Republican counties in swing congressional districts, and that voters in such counties became more aware of the trade war, its adverse impact, and that they assigned Republicans responsibility for escalating the trade dispute.
The Asian Trade Centre argued that Trump's usage of trade policy as a tactic to push non-trade related political initiatives, particularly his May 2019 threat to levy Mexican imports until they crackdown on illegal immigration, set a negative precedent for future U.S. presidents and damaged the credibility of the U.S. as a reliable trade partner.

Paul Ioannidis

Paul J. Ioannidis (22 February 1924 – 1 May 2021) was a German-born Greek pilot and Resistance fighter.
Early life.
Ioannidis was born in Berlin and raised in Athens.
During the first days of 1943, aged 18, he joined the Resistance against the German/Italian occupation. First, he joined the team of Nikiforos in the Greek People’s Liberation Army (ELAS) and subsequently “Force 133”, an allied military unit operating in occupied Greece, which was a party of the British “Special Operation Executive” (SOE).
In June 1944, following orders by the Middle East Allied Command, he escaped from Greece together with two British officers – McIntyre, Bob Morton - and reached Cairo. He was honored for his bravery during the war by King George VI with the “King’s Medal for Courage” (KMC) of the British Empire and with a Certificate of Commendation by the British Field Marshal Lord Alexander. He returned these distinctions, in protest as being devoid of any value, to Charles Peake, British Ambassador in Athens, on May 10, 1956, the same day that the Cypriot, freedom fighters of EOKA Karaolis and Dimitriou were executed in Nicosia.
He was trained as a fighter pilot by the British RAF. Subsequently he joined the Royal Hellenic Air Force and served until 1947. He was employed by the Greek air carrier TAE, which became Olympic Airways (OA), when Aristotle Onassis (ASO) acquired the company in 1957. At OA he served, successively, as Chief Instructor, Chief Pilot, Flight Operations Director and finally as Director General until December 1974.
In his will, ASO appointed him a lifetime member of the Board of Directors (BOD) of the “Onassis Foundation”, established in December 1975. He continued to fly with OA until February 1984 when he retired. He logged more than 22,500 hours as Captain and Instructor. For a period of 12 years, he was also flying the Royal Family as Captain on Olympic and VIP aircraft of the Greek Air Force.
Since the beginning of his career, he dealt with the most crucial part of aviation, “Flight Safety”. It was well known and verified since the mid 50s that “the Weakness of the Human Element” leads to “human error”, which is the main cause of all accidents in the field of transportation (land-sea-air), as well as in all other fields that a human being is involved.
This weakness was successfully dealt with in the field of air transportation by implementing: rigorous recurrent training, use of simulators and checklists, standard procedures/ regulations, in a spirit of teamwork, coordination, right mentality and self-discipline; the so-called “Airline Concept”.
Having acquired a thorough knowledge of aviation philosophy and extensive experience as a flight instructor, and after a 4-year preparation, he implemented successfully in 1982 the “Airline Concept” to the Onassis fleet.
Thus, the Onassis Group became a world pioneer in its effort to further improve effectively the safety of the: ship, crew, cargo and sea environment.
During the period 1975–1984 he was also involved with the business activities of the Onassis Foundation. He eventually undertook the duties of Chief Executive Officer of Shipping and Commercial Operations (CEO), an office held until 1995. He served also as Vice President of both Foundations – commercial and public benefit – until 2005.
He served as Chairman of the BOD of all companies owned by Christina Onassis and was one of the executors of her will.
He held the following offices and awarded the following distinctions:
He trained a whole generation of pilots and became CEO of the Onassis Foundation shipping business. His main, lasting contribution, to Greek shipping was applying the “Airline Concept” to shipping for the first time, not only for the Olympic fleet but sharing this with the Union of Greek Shipowners and Helmepa.
He continued to serve as a life member of the BOD of both Onassis Foundations, holding also the title of Vice-President Emeritus, in recognition of the services rendered to the Onassis Group and to the Foundations for more than 60 years.
Social activity: Through the projects of “the Alexander S. Onassis Public Benefit Foundation” for more than 40 years.
He wrote his biography in Greek, under the title “Even If You Are Not ….. You Will Become”, published in December 2007 by A. A. Livanis, which was translated into English under the title "Destiny Prevails".
He spoke English and elementary German.
Married to since 1950.

Trimble House (Wickliffe, Kentucky)

The Trimble House is a Queen Anne home built in 1905 at 725 North Fourth Street in Wickliffe, Kentucky, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.
The Kentucky Heritage Council released:As with any house, many influences impacted the Trimble House: the architects, a Kentucky owner, and the culture along the banks of the Mississippi River. The home was constructed by a town banker, Isaac N. Trimble, who originally resided in a Victorian-era home before he and his neighbors were displaced by two railroads – the Gulf, Mobile, and Ohio and the Illinois Central. Trimble relocated to Dennett Heights, a prominent high spot in town, and in 1905 built one of the town’s first brick houses featuring a simply detailed yet complex Queen Anne-style structure. The home’s architects were J.B. Legg and C.S. Holloway of St. Louis, who also designed the Ballard County Courthouse and Methodist Episcopal Church. Current owners Martha and Jim Wilson have lived in the house since 1954 and recently completed an extensive remodeling.

Rainbow (1837 ship)

The Rainbow was an iron paddle-wheel steamer for passengers and cargo, built in 1837 by John Laird in Birkenhead, England for the General Steam Navigation Company. The engines were produced by George Forrester and Company from Liverpool. It was said to be the largest iron steamer of its day, and the fastest. It covered 190 nautical miles in 14 hours during a passage to Antwerp. The ship has been described as "a landmark in naval architecture" and had "influence on Brunel", who traveled to Antwerp on the "Rainbow". It is seen as a "precursor of the ocean-going iron steamer".
The ship was intended to travel between London and Ramsgate, but also made voyages between London and Antwerp. Later she was used for the cargo trade between London and Le Havre. She was scrapped in 1869.
Sir George Biddell Airy, the Astronomer Royal, conducted experiments on board the ship about the influence of an iron hull on the workings of the compass.

Walter M. Digges

Walter Mitchell Digges (February 17, 1877 – October 5, 1934) was a lawyer, judge, and delegate in the Maryland General Assembly in Maryland, United States. He was a member of the Democratic Party, and served as a Justice of the state's high court, the Maryland Court of Appeals from 1923 to 1934.
Biography.
Digges was part of a prominent Maryland family. He was born on February 17, 1877, in Charles County, Maryland, to Dr. John T. Digges and his wife Catherine, née Mitchell. He studied at Charlotte Hall Military Academy, Maryland Agricultural College (a predecessor of the University of Maryland), and Maryland Law School, from which he graduated in 1902. He was admitted to the Maryland bar the same year.
Digges, a Democrat, beat Republican Sydney Mudd II in a close race to become a member of the Maryland House of Delegates and served from 1910 until 1912. In 1910, he tried to pass the Digges Amendment, which would have barred African Americans from voting. It was co-sponsored by William J. Frere, also from Charles County, in the Maryland Senate.
Digges had a law partnership with Walter Jenifer Mitchell until 1923, when Digges was appointed to the bench as a judge on the Maryland Court of Appeals. By 1933 he was Chief Judge of the 7th Judicial Circuit Court. He was president of the Maryland State Bar Association at the time of his death.
Digges was for some time a Naval Officer of Customs for the Department of Customs at the Port of Baltimore.
Personal life.
Digges married Mary Natalie Jenkins and they had four children: Eleanor Jenkins Digges, John Dudley Digges, Walter Mitchell Digges Jr., and Edward Simms Digges. He died on October 5, 1934, at his home in La Plata and was buried in the town after a service at the Christ Episcopal Church on October 18. His house, constructed for him in 1914-1915 and variously called "Chillum" and "Chilham", is of historic importance. Its name is derived from Chilham in England, from whence his ancestors came.

Motcomb Street

Motcomb Street is a street in the City of Westminster's Belgravia district in London. It is known for its luxury fashion shops, such as Christian Louboutin shoes, Stewart Parvin gowns, and the jeweller Carolina Bucci, and was the location of the original Pantechnicon department store.
The street runs south-west to north-east from Lowndes Street to a junction with Wilton Terrace, Wilton Crescent, and Belgrave Mews North. Kinnerton Street joins it on the north side and Halkin Mews is on the south side.
19th century.
The street first appeared on a map in the 1830s, and was originally called Kinnerton Mews, but soon became Motcomb Street. Although built as houses, many soon became shops, and by 1854 included cow keepers, bakers and grocers, and Richard Gunter had his confectionery shop there at the corner with Lowndes Street.
It was the location of the original Pantechnicon, a large building designed by Joseph Jobling and constructed by Seth Smith in 1834 as a bazaar or department store, mainly for the sale of carriages and household furniture and which covered two acres, bounded by Lowndes Street and Kinnerton Street. It was destroyed by fire in 1874, and rebuilt behind the facade, which was all that remained.
20th century and later.
In 1986, Thea Porter had a short business partnership with Princess Dina of Jordan in a smaller shop, Arabesque, on Motcomb Street. Zandra Rhodes has stated, "Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that".
The first Jimmy Choo shoe store was opened in 1996 on Motcomb Street. Christian Louboutin opened his first shoe store at no 23, and it is still trading there.
In 2015, it was announced that the Pantechnicon building would be redeveloped while maintaining its neo-classical façade.
In September 2017, following work to the street, it was reopened with a street party.

Galeyi Beygurt

Galeyi Beygurt (), also known as Galey-Bughurt () or simply Bughurt fortress () is a historic monument located 20 km north-east of the center of Shamakhi city.
Location.
The fortress is located at the summit of the mountain near Galeybughurd village and 1,600 meters above the sea level. The mountain, where the fortress is located is surrounded by Maiden Tower and Cangi mountain from the south, Tana mountain and the Alchalı Pir forest from the east, Mount Ulguc from the north and Galadarasi from the west.
History.
It is unknown when the fortress was built. It is believed that the history of the fortress dates back to XIII century. It is often referred to in the sources of the XV century.
During Shirvanshahs.
The fortress was a shelter for Shirvanshah during Mongol conquest. It was also used during the period of Shirvanshah Kequbad and Kavus. When Shah Ismayil attacked Shirvan in 1509, Shirvanshah Shaykhshah was defended at Bughurt fortress. In 1518 the Safavid armies attacked Shirvan under the leadership of Alqas Mirza Safavid. Shahrukh and lawyer Hussein Bey, who retreated into the Bughurt fortress, could resist the Safavids for several months. Also, at that time, the treasury of the Shirvanshahs was kept at the Bughurt fortress.
During Safavids.
According to Iskandar Munshi’s writings, during these wars both Gulustan and Bugurt fortresses was destroyed by the order of Tahmasp. During march of Suleiman the Magnificent to Shirvan, Abdollah Khan was beylerbey of Shirvan. At this time, the head of the Turkish troops, Gasim Bey used Bugurt fortress as a defensive point. It proves Iskandar Munshi's claim wrong. The fortress was until late XVII century.

The journalist Daniela Heunis of Rhodes University described him as follows, after an in-depth interview and research:" He represented South African society before the 1994 elections. He was well loved and was not a racist.
De Villiers's music forms showed such a unity with the poetry that it had the character of folk songs. 
De Villiers exclusively composed music for texts in Afrikaans, which made him inaccessible to most foreigners except speakers of Dutch.
He obtained unity between music and the text by internalizing the text before composing. He then let the music be heard through the words. 
When he started composing, he realized that the Afrikaans songs sung at the time were inaccessible to the man in the street, and he wanted to change that Quoting from Arthur Honegger, he said: "My inclination and my effort have always been to write music which would be comprehensible to the great massive listeners and at the same time sufficiently free of banality to interest genuine music lovers”.
His outlook was to be honest with oneself. He said “one can only compose what one is, otherwise it will be fictitious.' This also contributed to his selection of the texts he used.
Before he began composing, he would recite the poem to himself, to find the rhythm of the words and the main stresses in the verse. He then acquainted himself with the vowel sounds.
He tried to understand the purpose and meaning of the words in the music. 
He is recognized as having composed songs with character. The text with the singable melodies of his songs made them cultural possessions. An example is his settings of the Boerneef poems "Aandblom is 'n witblom", "Doer boe teen die rant", etc.
Death.
He died at his home in Stellenbosch on 18 May 2015.

FS Class 113

FS Class 113 was a class of 0-4-2 steam locomotives of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), inherited from older railway companies on the nationalization of Italian railways in 1905. They were built by Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C. between 1854 and 1869.
History.
Some of the locomotives were from Strade Ferrate dello Stato Piemontese (SFSP). The first 8 locomotives were built between 1854 and 1855 and among them was the famous "Sampierdarena", the first entirely Italian construction of Giovanni Ansaldo's locomotive factory. A group of 4 units, built in 1857, came from the Ferrovia Alessandria–Stradella, (private under concession). While another 18 units had been built for the Società per le strade ferrate dell'Alta Italia (SFAI). In 1865 they all passed to the SFAI, which had absorbed all the various local companies and the former Piedmontese state railways. 
A further 10 units were built, between 1863 and 1869, for the Victor Emmanuel Railway, later the Società per le Strade Ferrate Calabro-Sicule (SFCS) for use on the Calabrian-Sicilian lines and they were numbered SFCS 1-10. The first three, named "Archimede", "Diodoro" and "Novelli", inaugurated the Palermo - Bagheria line, the first railway section on the island of Sicily, on 28 April 1863.
In 1885 all 40 passed to the Rete Mediterranea (RM), which numbered them RM 2733-2773. In 1905, the Ferrovie dello Stato registered only 25 units and assigned them to Class 113, with numbers from 1131 to 1155. However, these were obsolete machines which were soon withdrawn and scrapped. They are not included in the FS list of locomotives and railcars at 30 June 1914.

Maeba (album)

Maeba is the 74th studio album by Italian singer Mina. It was released on 23 March 2018 by PDU Music&amp;Production and Sony Music Italy. It contains ten new songs and two covers, and is available in digital download, CD, and vinyl. The first single was the opening track "Volevo scriverti da tanto", and was released on 9 March 2018.
Background.
After the released of "Le migliori" with Adriano Celentano in 2016, Mina came back in 2018 with "Maeba", her first solo studio album since "Selfie" in 2014. The cover art shows the singer like an alien, an image already used as a hologram during the final of "Sanremo Festival 2018" and on the cover of "Piccolino", Mina's 2011 album. The album features 12 tracks and a 'surprise' for fans. Mina's son, Massimiliano Pani, produced and arranged the songs, which span many genres ranging from rhythm &amp; blues to electronics, from rock to jazz. The album also contains songs sung in three languages: Italian, English, and Neapolitan. It was recorded and mixed at the PDU studios in Lugano, the strings were recorded at the Officine Meccaniche studio in Milan, while the mastering and transfer were performed by Alessandro Di Guglielmo at the Elettroformati studio.
Singles.
The first single released from the album was “Volevo scriverti da tanto”, a striking and emotional melodic ballad creating an atmosphere for the listener only Mina knows how to create: one of those songs that needs a great interpreter to express it fully. The composer is Moreno Ferrara, one of the most important Italian choristers, while the lyrics were written by Maria Francesca Polli, who has collaborated in the past with Roby Facchinetti, Claudio Baglioni, and Franco Fasano. The lyrics are a yearning letter to a person who can never read it.

Early life.
Virginia Keys Jones was born to Edward and Mary Jones in Wheeling, West Virginia on December 14, 1904. The family moved to Grand Rapids, Michigan, when Virginia was four years old in order to ensure that she would attend an integrated school. In the 1920s, she moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to teach at Stowe School, the first all-black school in the city. She sought to leave the city, because of the segregation she saw, but was encouraged to stay and join the local branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People by Ted Berry. After working as a teacher for a few more years, she chose to dedicate herself fully to working for racial equality.

Coffey in the 1940s, afterwards forming the first Girl Scouts troop for African-American girls. In 1948, she was named Deputy Director of the Mayor of Cincinnati's Friendly Relations Committee, a position she held until 1962 when she left to be community relations supervisor for Seven Hills Neighborhood Houses for the following three years. While on the Friendly Relations Committee, Virginia worked to help integrate parts of the city. This included the swimming pools from 1950 onwards, and the Coney Island amusement park in 1961.
Virginia advised several industrial cities in the UK in 1963, helping them to manage community tensions caused by large numbers of immigrants from the West Indies. Between 1965–68, she was director of the Memorial Community Center and became a human relations consultant for the University of Cincinnati. Virginia was on the board of the Hamilton County Welfare Department, as well as the president's council of Xavier University.

Promineral SA

Promineral S.A. is a Portuguese company owned by Renova SA.
Its main activity is the extraction and bottling of mineral still and sparkling waters of the dormant Furnas volcano in São Miguel, in the Azores archipelago. It currently employs c. 10 people with a support and decision center located in mainland Portugal. Although its origins can be traced back to 1890, this entity exists since 1999, after being acquired by the Portuguese paper company Renova SA.
History.
The bottling of natural sparkling water in Serra do Trigo (Furnas, S Miguel Island, Azores) started by the end of the 19th century. The business was founded and early developed by the Machado family. The natural characteristics of these waters have earned it national and international prizes. Between 1895 and 1932, in Europe and in the Americas, it earned five gold medals, one silver medal and two ‘grand prix’ medals. The bottling of these waters has been temporarily shut down between the late 1970s to the late 1990s. Its activity has restarted in 1990, with renewed ownership, capitals and investment. During June 1990, the semi-automatic filling line was inaugurated, with a capacity for 2000 bottles per hour. A second investment was concluded in November 1994: the acquisition of the Gloria Patri still water spring. In October 1995 a flavored sparkling water line was launched (Pedras do Galego). New capital was raised in 1995 transforming the company in a SA (Anonimous Society - Sociedade Anónima - in Portuguese): Promineral SA. The first complete year of activity of Promineral SA was 1996 with over 2.5 million liters put in the markets, mainly in the Azores archipelago, all brands combined. This volume corresponded, at the time, to 56% of the Azorean Archipelago market share. Several difficulties have dictated the end of the production, a process that culminated in the sale of the company to Renova SA in 1999. 
Renova SA, is a Portuguese company owner of the leader brand of tissue paper products in Portugal (Renova), with a strong presence in Spain, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the Baltic countries and currently exported to over 65 countries (as per 2017). Renova has implemented several new investments in infra-structures, machineries and technical staff, in order to comply with the evolution of all the quality standards required by the Portuguese and European Union laws. A micro-biology laboratory, for example, was set in 2001. During 2004 new investments were done to increase the Gloria Patri spring production volumes from 6 cubic meters per hour to 30 cubic meters per hour. Over the years several investments have been made to increase the overall production capacity of the facility and quality preservation of the water born from the springs. Currently, an installed capacity of 10 million liters per year is in place. New investments have also been made after 2010 to improve all the aspects of the operation and respective branding in order to create a global enterprise comprising several brands of a unique resource: natural mineral waters, still and sparkling.

Richard Walter Thomas

Richard Walter Thomas (born April 2, 1939) is a retired African-American professor of Michigan State University known for his work in black issues and race relations. He has published a number of scholarly works, his poetry has been gathered in various anthologies, and he has given a variety of talks, workshops, and interviews on issues of race and race relations.
Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, in his later youth Thomas was introduced to the early forms of black power movements and joined the Baháʼí Faith in 1962. He met people like Margaret Danner and Ron Milner. Thomas then became a student at Michigan State University (MSU) in 1966. When he returned home that summer he experienced the 1967 Detroit riot, and after some campus activism and success publishing, in his junior year he attended the funeral of Martin Luther King Jr. and began an activism on race issues on and beyond campus. In his senior year Thomas founded an assistance program for black students on campus, wrote for the campus newspaper and transitioned directly to a Master's Degree program. In 1970 Thomas graduated and joined the staff of the new Center for Urban Affairs on campus and his poetry was included in "A galaxy of black writing". Around the same time Thomas married South Carolinian June Manning. Before coming to MSU in 1968 she had been part of the reaction to the Orangeburg massacre. Both continued to hold various positions over the next few years and by 1976 they had two children and both began to pursue PhDs at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor – he finished his in 1976 on black history of Detroit from 1915 to 1945 and she finished hers in 1977.
Returning to MSU in 1979, Thomas started as an associate professor of racial and ethnic studies working in the department's new program in the study of human rights. It was the first campus program that would feature African-American history as well as examples from the wider world of race issues and the work being done to address them. That year he also co-wrote the book "Blacks and Chicanos in Urban Michigan". The Thomas' kept up service and visibility in the Baháʼí community such as being present for the 50th anniversary of Louhelen Baháʼí School. Thomas gave a 30 minute talk at the 9th Association of Baháʼí Studies (ABS) conference in 1984 and would continue to contribute to ABS conferences and publications in succeeding years: a day-long seminar on inter-cultural issues, a convener and editor for invited papers on "Models of racial unity" and the Hasan M. Balyuzi Memorial Lectureship. He also contributed a chapter to a book "Circle of Unity". Thomas also began to make appearances at and gave assistance to initiatives on race justice and equality in communities such as in Chicago at an award-winning program.
In 1987 Thomas was named a professor at MSU and co-wrote "Detroit: Race and Uneven Development" via Temple University Press, a text that has been updated and printed by MSU Press. His contribution highlighted what Thomas began to think of as the "Other Tradition" of black-white cooperation, anti-racism. That same year Thomas became a founding member of the Black Men's Gathering (BMG) to encourage the leadership of service of black men in the religion. In 1992 Thomas revised his PhD and published "Life for Us is what We Make it: Building Black Community in Detroit, 1915–1945" through Indiana University Press and the Thomas' were also noted attending the Baháʼí World Congress. Now using the term "The Other Tradition", in 1993 Thomas wrote "Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress" and "Understanding interracial unity: a study of U.S. race relations". 1996 was the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience (MRULE) project at MSU he founded with one of his advanced degree students and was eventually the subject of several advanced degrees at several universities. In 1997 Thomas contributed a chapter to a book on how non-profit non-governmental organizations contributed to social justice in "Social justice philanthropy " reviewing the American Baháʼí community as one case. Since 1997 Thomas had often been elected annually to the Regional Baháʼí Council of the area – a mid-level institution with responsibilities over Baháʼí communities in several states. In 2002 Thomas wrote "Bridging Racial Divides in Michigan's Urban Communities" published through MSU Press and several decades of work culminated in the text "Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Baháʼís in North America, 1898–2004" with Thomas as a co-editor, wrote three chapters of it, and was published by the US Baháʼí Publishing Trust. In 2007 Thomas contributed to "The State of black Michigan, 1967–2007 " by MSU Press and his poetry was included in "Black Fire: An Anthology of Afro-American Writing".
In 2012 Thomas retired from MSU. In 2013 he wrote and co-wrote two texts – "Disenfranchisement: Social Health Issues and Implications" and "Detroit: Race Riots, Racial Conflicts, and Efforts to Bridge the Racial Divide. and Communication". Since 2015 he has made several appearances discussing "The Other Tradition" theme.
Biography.
Born and raised in Detroit.
Richard Walter Thomas was born April 2, 1939, in Detroit, Michigan, son of Walter and Estelle Thomas, living in the Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects, near Hastings Street, later calling it a ghetto. The Brewster-Douglass Project were built for the "working poor"; the Detroit Housing Commission required an employed parent for each family before establishing tenancy. 
Thomas commented his father didn't believe in non-violence such as by Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., though they did support the union movement in the city. Thomas recalled his parents talking about the 1943 Detroit race riot and said it affected the state of race identity and relations as he grew up and he still gets nervous from the history of "boundaries" and warnings his parents gave him of crossing them in the 1940s and 50s. In the period from 1940 to 1950, more than 66% of the black population in Detroit had been born outside the area, with most born in the South. The increase in population had strained city schools and services for all residents and began an era from 1950 to 1970 of "de facto" racial segregation in the Metro Detroit area. Those white people who were more established economically moved out of the city to newly developed suburbs, which often were divided by class and income levels. In that period black growth in the suburbs averaged 2.7%, while in previous decades it had been 5%. Social tensions increased as blacks felt oppressed by discrimination, a majority-white police force, and restricted housing.
Thomas was a graduate of the last non-integrated class of Miller High School in 1957, after which he joined the United States Marine Corps. He was discharged from the Marines in 1960, returned to Detroit to live with his parents and four siblings. Contrasting with being a black man serving in an integrated military, he recalls being arrested near Canfield Ave and W Woodward Ave in Detroit as part of the norms in Detroit, akin to an incident of Driving while black and that stores and hospitals would not serve blacks.
He "flitted with the idea of becoming a minister" but other friends inspired him to try poetry instead. "This is one of the roads that led me to the (Baháʼí) Faith".
Black Poetry and Baháʼí.
Thomas hung out at Bill and Marie "Mama" Summer's home. There he encountered the National Islam, even being "courted" and visiting an orthodox Muslim home, as well as Marie's less heated and "rough street approach" of her husband Bill. While at their home, Thomas encountered "...Fred _ , (who) was a Baháʼí white graduate student from Wayne State University (WSU,) and 'was very naive about race'". "Fred's religion did not interest me at the time. I was too involved in poetry." Nevertheless, it was Fred who introduced Thomas to the work of Margaret Danner – a Baha’i and well known black poet and then poet-in-residence at WSU and stayed at the home of Naomi Oden. Thomas was invited to share his poetry with Danner and he was "ecstatic" to visit a published black poet though he felt threatened by the mention of the religion. Thomas also met black poet Ron Milner and "with their help and inspiration I got myself together." Danner was visible in the local Detroit news from July. Danner and Milner were among a group working on publishing in 1961.
Joined the Baháʼí Faith.
The presence of Baháʼís was visible in Detroit back to 1916; and well known Baháʼís visited - Martha Root, and Louis George Gregory. The Davison area Louhelen Baháʼí School opened in 1931 some 60 miles away. 1960 opened with the Baháʼís holding World Religion Day, followed by the June Race Amity Day talk, and classes on the Baháʼí view of race unity at Louhelen. In 1961 the Baháʼís in Detroit held the Race Unity Picnic, and WSU hosted a multifaith meeting that included the Baháʼí Club in the autumn. Thomas recalled his fundamentalist Black Baptist mother thinking talk about interracial unity was from communists. Nevertheless Thomas joined the religion in 1962 after a period of study. As he says:I had got quite comfortable hanging out with Baháʼís, ... (and) was seriously studying the Faith, but for me, a devout Baptist, a monumental religious barrier stood in the way: was Bahá'u'lláh really the return of the Spirit of Christ? ... It would have profound personal, family, social and church community consequences. And Mama Bruce was not budging. 'Boy!!' she exclaimed one day. 'Do you know what day you're living in!!?' She would not suffer vacillation, foolish or otherwise.
I know exactly where I was and what I was doing when I decided to accept Bahá’u'lláh as the return of the Spirit of Christ and the Prophet of God for this day: sitting at the dining room table in my parents' house reading "Thief in the Night" ... Then, thanks to Mr. Bill Sears's wonderful book, it struck me! These people, these good, God-intoxicated Christians in 1844 were looking in the wrong place! They were searching for the Second Coming in the clouds of their spiritual misunderstanding... As much as I loved my mom, minister, friends, Sunday school teachers, and dearly loved listening and singing and swaying with the choir, I had to make a decision, scary as it was to make. I decided in that quiet night, while the household slept, that I was going to accept Bahá’u'lláh as the return of the Christ Spirit, as the Prophet for this day and age.
Naomi and Mama Bruce would leap with joy! But, Lord help me! What would Mom say when she heard I was not only leaving the church of my birth but joining a strange religion that placed a strange Prophet on the same level as precious Jesus, who rescued our slave forebears and softened our present sorrows and grief... I now recall how I did not help matters much by being overly enthusiastic about my new Faith. I could have been far more diplomatic in my dealings with Mom and my former church community but I was young and excited and inspired by the stories of the Báb and the Bábís and their sacrifices of life and limb... At the same time, it also inspired me more than I had ever been inspired by the years of listening to preaching, choir singing and Sunday school lessons. The more I read of the life of the Báb, Bahá'u'lláh and `Abdu'l-Bahá, the more I wanted to tell the entire world, to hit the streets like the Bábís, proclaiming the good news to everyone who would listen, regardless of the risks.
But this was a turbulent time for black Baháʼís and Thomas speaks of his own struggles:There were times when, like other young African-American Baháʼís, I found myself at odds with older Baháʼís views of the racial crisis. We younger African-Americans were greatly influenced by Malcolm X and the civil rights and Black Power movements. We were the first generation of African-American Baháʼís to be shaped by these powerful social forces... This tended to strain relationships within local Baháʼí communities between some older Black and White Baháʼís, ... and younger Black 'radical' Baháʼís... The latter's concerns were often interpreted by the former as a source of disunity. On the other hand, the younger Black Baháʼís felt that some of the older Baháʼís wanted to maintain the racial status quo within the Baháʼí community.
Thanks to older, wiser and especially sensitive African-American Baháʼís such as Naomi, ... we were able to survive our frustrations and eventually come to terms with those Baháʼís who were not yet prepared to challenge the racial status quo, even as the racial conflicts of the 1960s exploded around them. In the process we learned a valuable lesson about the power of the Covenant to create unity in the midst of racial and cultural differences."
Out of this, Thomas says, "For the first time in my angry bag, I was able to see what Black poets could do with an eye big as the earth." In 1966 Marie Bruce had gone to Mississippi. The year Thomas joined the religion opened with the Baháʼís mentioned in the newspaper in January. In March another article profiled the religion, and then a Baháʼí appeared on local television. That Fall an advertising campaign promoted the claims of Bahá'u'lláh in Detroit associated with some meetings organized by Winston Evans. Margaret Danner was still noted active in the area for years to come. Naomi was a businesswoman and joined the religion in 1949. Naomi would be noted in the newspaper at her death in 1987 with long years of service in the community.
Louhelen and SC.
In 1964 Thomas took part in an initiative similar to the Freedom Summer campaign with connections at the Baháʼí School in Michigan, later called Louhelen Baháʼí School, and the burgeoning Baháʼí community of Greenville, South Carolina, which was integrating its schools that Fall. Training sessions for a project were noted in the "Baháʼí News" in August. Some 80 youth attended the training in mid-June with faculty like Firuz Kazemzadeh. After the classes in various subjects, 27 individuals went to 8 locations including Greenville, S.C. Six youth including Thomas went to Greenville under the sponsorship of the local assembly there for a 6 week program. Local youth joined in. The group worked on tutoring some 55 black students about to attend newly integrating schools, held informational meetings on the religion, and supported petitioning for the public swimming pool being integrated. The work was capped with a parent-teacher banquet reception at a church and a picnic for the students conducted by the Baháʼí teachers. The group visited many churches, restaurants, parks, stores, and a community center to demonstrate solidarity with the black community. Side ventures included the Baháʼí Summer School near Ashville, NC, going to Greensboro, NC, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference training camp near Savannah, GA. Thomas met men who cooperated with projects he was later involved with: John Mangum, and William "Smitty" Smith. Thomas recalled that black and white Baháʼís stayed in the homes of the other color and that their efforts received threatening notes because they held interracial meetings. Thomas also recalled a tense morning breakfast he and a white Baháʼí went on one Sunday morning.
Back in Detroit later in the spring of 1965 Joe Louis' sister, Eulalia Barrow Bobo, gave a talk on the religion, followed a couple days later by a resister of the Nazi regime and soon Baha'i,(next year) Rosey E. Pool.
Michigan State University.
Thomas was soon to attend Michigan State University (MSU) in Lansing, Michigan. There was Baháʼí activity on MSU campus before Thomas arrived in 1966. The Baháʼí club was officially organized in 1963. John Magnum, a former police officer and a Golden Gloves champion, was also on campus - he had been involved in the 1964 trip to Greenville, S.C. Magnum was also an original member of the Black Men's Group with Thomas.
Freshman.
That Fall when Thomas entered as a freshman, a slideshow of Baháʼís held on campus in July. The Baháʼí club at MSU that fall had four Baha'is – Bob Cameron, Faramarz Samadany, Richard Thomas himself, and Kenneth Gottlied. That year's state Baháʼí convention to elect a delegate to the national convention was held in Lansing and expected some 300 to attend. The club opened 1967 sponsoring a talk, followed by a profiles of the religion published in the campus newspaper, and presented a panel discussion on racial crisis and the international situation. Thomas' poetry was also criticized in the student newspaper. Later that Spring Robert L. Green, who had worked with Martin Luther King Jr and the Southern Christian Leadership Committee, criticized some black students, including Thomas, while attending a campus Malcolm X rally - that if they believed in black nationalism they were being hypocritical for staying on the white MSU campus vs being on the streets like Malcolm X but then complimented them for various actions he knew they were involved with and working towards an integrated society as the "... best hope for freedom and equality for black people..."
Thomas, at home in Detroit that summer, was there amidst the 1967 Detroit riot, one of 159 riots that swept cities in the United States during the "Long Hot Summer of 1967". He recalls calling it the "rebellion"; the most severe riot in Detroit ever and the worst of the country that year, but as in comments of Joe Darden, that the conflict included dimensions beyond black-white issues.
Sophomore.
The Fall of 1967 was noted with the Baháʼí community observing the centenary of Bahá'u'lláh's Summons of the Lord of Hosts with the Baháʼís in Lansing, Thomas taught a session that winter as part of an overall theme of the anticipated centennial observations. In February 1968 Thomas wrote a letter to the editor responding to what he saw as a defensive reaction by campus administration to demands made for teaching black history. In early April Thomas wrote a review of black poetry debating LeRoi Jones vs Robert Hayden. He supported that Jones was reflected more in black society while Hayden pursued black identity amidst human reality and then stated both are needed for a complete picture. "They are proclaiming the aesthetic legitimacy of each flower in the human garden – as black flowers." And then Thomas contributed three poems to the newspaper: "The 9th Savior", "Ethnography of a downtown joint", "Edith mother of man". One stanza of "Edith":
&lt;poem&gt;Edith mother of man 
and sister of broken brothers 
who wore their iron too black 
would not adjust their speed 
to quit bumping the white sun 
in their bleeding skies&lt;/poem&gt;
Thomas later recalled a black student organization was born on campus following the speech of Congress of Racial Equality's Floyd McKissick at MSU. In late April Thomas was a representative of the Black Student Alliance at MSU "Days of Conscience" investigations in the campus relationships to the Vietnam war. He spoke of the "assassination of MLK and its implication on white America... (to those that mourned his assassination) Tears are not enough... (to those that inherited white racism) there will be no rest", blamed both sets of whites for the death, and then addressed the black students to question if "'law and order' was orderly racism, not justice." In May an essay by Thomas' was first place in a campus contest in the humanities school with reviewers affirming it as both highly scholarly and an organic expression of culture. Thomas' award winning essay begins as an analysis/reflection of Camus' "The Stranger" and "The Plague" as going towards a new morality, a new humanism: "a shift, a deliberate sensitizing of the basic components of humanity that are a very real and essential part of us – to extend ourselves into another person's soul as they are." And that year "Nine Black Poets" was published which included Thomas' work, considered one of the significant works of the year, though at least one reviewer found the attention of calling to God tiresome.
Junior.
Thomas had attended the funeral of Martin Luther King, Jr, and wrote an article for the student newspaper. In it Thomas reviews hearing attendees struggle with the assassination as framed between various points of view. On one side was NAACP leader from NC Robert Williams (who felt non-violence should only be seen as a tactic and not a principle) and those advancing the non-violence and civil disobedience approach by talking with others. Then Thomas gave a talk about the relevance of MSU to "black power" speaking on behalf of the Black Student Alliance. Later in August Thomas wrote an article on the Baháʼís and the race crisis in the campus newspaper. He summarized `Abdu’l-Bahá’s actions in light of race and then America as a place of the international struggle of racism. He underscored the standards at Baháʼí schools following `Abdu’l-Bahá’s guidance and then Shoghi Effendi on inter-racial unity and that this had particularized to the voting system inside the religion and quoted Shoghi Effendi's "most challenging issue" statement at length. In September Thomas is called a Special Assistant to the "National Baháʼí Department of Youth and College Activities" and was quoted speaking of how to be relevant across a cultural divide: "Unity in diversity rather than integration, which is paternalistic, is the thing." Thomas also spoke at a Phoenix gathering sponsored by the assembly. In October Thomas wrote an article for the MSU news about the increasing complexity of leadership in black power movements, some only tangentially interested in addressing the social change while other leaders were becoming insensitive to engaging the wider community with an increasing "more radical-than-thou" tone, and then speaking in November for the Black Student Association sisterhood. Hayden again appeared on MSU campus in November. After the winter break an article covered Baháʼí activity in the Lansing community and noted there were 16 Baháʼís in the area, and then that summer the community had a Race Unity picnic.
Senior.
In 1969 Thomas co-founded a black aid program. That summer Thomas attended the "YOW! summer seminar" of youth facing social justice issues for the Baháʼí Faith. Thomas shared "his experience as a black man and a black Baháʼí, exposed daily to the anger and agony of fellow blacks in the North, forever having to explain to the increasingly fervid adherents of black nationalism and black liberation his continued involvement in a movement that is not only "religious" but interracial. Then Thomas attended a youth Baháʼí conference at Frogmore, SC where he spoke. Back in Lansing the film "A New Wind" was debuted for the Birth of Bahá'u'lláh observance. That year Thomas was among those proposed by a black student organization to begin offering classes at MSU that winter of 1969–70.
In the spring of 1970 Thomas spoke at a national conference on education among Baháʼís for a focus on minorities. and then there were talks on campus on the religion, including sponsored by the club. That summer Baháʼís held Race Unity Day picnic. Meanwhile Thomas finished his Master's Thesis.
Professional academic and married.
Center for Urban Affairs.
In 1970 Thomas was noted contributing to a book "A galaxy of black writing". At the same time the Lansing Baháʼí assembly undertook various actions and observances, and often with the college club such as UN Day, and World Religion Day.
In 1968 the MSU Board of Trustees created a combination unit of the Center for Urban Affairs and Equal Opportunities Programs (CUE-EOP) to develop instructional, research and service programs relative to urban and minority programs; to facilitate an increase in minority faculty, staff and students at MSU; and to develop an affirmative action and anti-discrimination program for the university. In 1970, the CUA-EOP office separated and with the Center for Urban Affairs(CUA) retaining most of the budget. Thomas contributed some poems to the student newspaper and the article noted he was recently married and now worked in the Center for Urban Affairs. Richard's wife was June Manning. June, daughter of then Claflin University president Reverend Hubert V. and Ethel Manning, The reverend was president starting in 1956, moving from Charleston, SC. June attended the black Wilkinson High School for 1963–4 and then was to finish her high school in the newly integrating Orangeburg High School in 1964 which she attended through 1967. June was one of about a dozen black students who desegregated the formerly all-white school. June attended a special summer training school for experience before hand, similar to the project Richard had taken part in . And the integration process was from a lawsuit of her parents and was June's 10th grade. During her senior year she learned of the Baháʼí Faith. Some supportive contributions to her transition came from some white friends and teachers who demonstrated personal comfort with her and respect. June's experiences were included in a middle-school spiritual training text. June won national awards despite the violence done to her by others at the school, and attended Furman University as part of the class after the first black student attended there the year before, and where she made the Dean's list. The Orangeburg massacre happened during her last year at Furman and she worked as a voting educator before coming to MSU in 1968. She continued to achieve high grades, scholarships and awards at MSU. In 1970 she was co-director in the Office of Black Affairs and finished her BA in Sociology, graduating magna cum laude and joined Phi Beta Kappa. Thomas recalled his brother attending the marriage and seeing the diversity of people attending the Baháʼí wedding commenting "What is this, the United Nations?!?" Thomas' employment was initially part time but shifted to full-time in June 1972.
In the fall of 1971 the Baháʼís held UN Day with the club. On campus there was a shuffle of jobs at the CUA. Meanwhile the club at MSU held a meeting about "revitalizing" education. At the time June was a research assistant at the Center for Urban Affairs. That Fall Thomas gave a talk on campus about the struggles of black men in America. Next April Thomas was among those also spoke at a series of Baháʼí seminars in the city. In April 1973 Thomas was shifted from being an instructor and research director for media projects to instructor in racial and ethnic studies. That summer the Baháʼís held Race Unity Day, and in the fall Thomas' mother Estelle joined in a letter to the editor community response to a case of harassment in Detroit.
In 1974 June was Policy Planner in the Michigan Department of Social Services for a few months but for the next couple years had no professional or academic work on her vita. However she made her first appearance giving a Baháʼí talk. In November the MSU campus Baháʼís were active and the Thomas' were among those hosting Baháʼí events in their home. Thomas spoke again a couple weeks later, and they hosted events in their home in succeeding weeks the rest of 1974, and into 1975. As a PhD student Thomas was teaching a class on race relations at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and a professor asked him "why was he wasting his time".
In the autumn of 1975 June and Richard published an article in "Futurology". All along Thomas had been working on his PhD which he finished January 1976. He noted now 5 years since being married they had two children: Kemba and Ali. And along the period June also worked on her PhD.
In late February 1976 Thomas was among those who answered student questions responding to three hooded men who marched through campus. In March Baháʼís from four communities gathered for a Baháʼí New Year observance at which Thomas spoke.
Assistant/associate professor.
The next several years the Thomas' and the regional Baháʼí community were visible in various circumstances and events. That summer June was an Instructor in Urban &amp; Metropolitan Studies at MSU and finished her PhD in 1977. There were four distinct communities of Baháʼís around the Lansing area in a survey of religious communities published in the local newspaper. The Bahá'is organized public meetings and observances. In January 1977 Thomas was mentioned among all the MSU professors that contributed to "The Third Coast". The Civic Art Center in Battle Creek hosted "Riverlight Poetry Fair" where Thomas appeared with Dudley Randall in May. That year June was an assistant professor in a joint effort of the Departments of Urban &amp; Metropolitan Studies and Urban Planning at MSU. The following January 1978 Thomas gave the talk for the Baháʼí sponsored World Religion Day in Lansing. That year Thomas was listed as an assistant professor of Racial and Ethnic Studies. Both Thomas' aided in the coordination of a public meeting as part of a race unity conference held at MSU sponsored by the four area assemblies. The public meeting featured a talk by Magdalene Carney, then a member of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baháʼís of the United States. Follow-up coverage summarized Carney's speech. In December both Thomas', with Tina Guy and Napolun Birdsall, were on the committee for holding the Human Rights Day event sponsored by the Lansing Baháʼí assembly.
Professional advances also came along for both Thomas'. In 1979 Thomas was interviewed for the campus radio station WKAR; he was called an associate professor of racial and ethnic studies and discussed the department's new program in the study of human rights. There would be four new classes as part of it – introduction to human rights, violations of human rights, human rights advocates, and affirmative action. He thought interested students would be aiming at policy and programs of the topics and those who want to learn about these issues, the traditions of human rights and violations and wider context of these around the world and across disciplines. That year Thomas also authored a chapter of, and co-edited, "Blacks and Chicanos in Urban Michigan". His chapter was entitled "The black urban experience in Detroit: 1916–1967," occupying nearly 30 pages of the text. In 1980 both Thomas', along with others co-authored a set of recommendations for an Urban Policy Working Group appointed by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development as a chapter in a report to then president Carter. Then in May Thomas was a member of a "teach in" responding the unrest of camps following the Mariel boatlift of Cuban refugees.
In 1981 the Thomas' were present for the 50th anniversary of Louhelen Baháʼí School and the return of Magdalene Carney. June was then an associate professor in the Department of Urban Studies at Cleveland State University and both were on unpaid leave from MSU. That year the Thomas' guest edited and wrote parts of a special issue of "Catalyst" magazine entitled "The State of the Black Community in Capitalist America". They co-wrote the introduction and June wrote one of the articles. This issue was published as one of the few that year for various challenges in the magazine. In 1982 June joined the MSU fault as an associate professor in the Urban Planning and Urban Affairs Programs which continued into 1995. In October 1983 Thomas presented on "The Black Church and Trade Unionism: 1925-1941" at the 68th Annual Meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History. Thomas was also visible giving a 30 minute talk at the 9th Association of Baháʼí Studies (ABS) conference that Fall. In it Thomas speaks on Shoghi Effendi's statements and punctuates it with comments of history dwelling at some length on the requirements Shoghi Effendi specified for the "new race of men" – a high sense of moral rectitude, absolute chastity, and complete freedom from prejudice. The first was emphasized on the leaders of the religion. The second was pointed out to the youth especially. The third was specifically addressed to all Baháʼís, since racial prejudice had attacked the American society – the "most vital and challenging issue". Thomas credited Shoghi Effendi's correct view of the challenge of racism in America from afar and was punctuated by riots and struggles in American society since then. Thomas called the work unprecedented and "sharply contrasted" to the race-ideas common in America. He underscored that Baháʼís had resolved matters among them they could demonstrate it to the wider society – that the "double crusade" was still the work to be done and that Baháʼís would face misunderstanding, misconstrued goals, be scorned, belittled, undermined, deserted from time to time, but that criticism reinforced the spread of awareness, unpopularity strengthened the contrast, and ostracism actually attracts some. Also in 1984 Thomas co-wrote a paper "The State of Black Detroit: Building from Strength, the Black Self-help Tradition in Detroit" which was published in a couple of books. And, last for 1984, Thomas contributed a chapter to a book "Circle of Unity" published by a Baháʼí associated publishing house. The overall text generated a lot of discussion, sometimes heated. In 1985 Thomas spoke at the 10th ABS conference.
In 1986 Thomas was part of a panel at a Baháʼí peace conference in San Francisco, and contributed a paper "Promoting Unity in a Multi-racial society" to the next ABS meeting. Thomas was later noted as a co-founder of Fathers, Inc. in Detroit in 1986 along with John Mangum Jr and Marvin Hughes. The organization was the initiative of John Magnum, former policeman, as a response to the goal of the Baháʼí Six Year Plan calling for "a greater involvement of the Faith in the life of society" starting with Mangum's own children and adding cousins and friends until it reached some 40 young people and incorporated as a non-profit in 1989.
Professor.
On Detroit and the gathering theme of "The Other Tradition".
In 1987 Thomas co-wrote "Detroit: Race and Uneven Development" via Temple University Press, and was reviewed positively as a portrayal of the difficulties Detroit suffered particularly since 1952, (a separate revisit to the subject was published in 2013 via Michigan State University Press.) That same year Billy Roberts, then an Auxiliary Board member of the Baháʼí Faith, a mid-lower level administrative position, and later member of the National Assembly, observed that, to his view, few black men were visible participating in local and regional leadership among Baháʼís. He called for a meeting of black Baháʼí men to see about ways of enlivening black men participating in the community more. Eleven men met him in Greensboro, NC, in late October 1987. This was the start of the Black Men's Group. John Mangum, Richard Thomas, and Marvin Hughes drove together to the Greensboro meeting. In the summer of 1988 a larger group met at Louis Gregory Institute and in 1998 it was moved to Green Acre. It was cathartic and dedicative and met annually to assist the activity of black men in the Baháʼí community. In 1988 the MSU Baháʼí club sponsored a talk for Black history month. and June spoke at a spring meeting of the club. And a couple weeks later Thomas was part of a panel sponsored by the club, as part of a campus "Cross cultural week".
Thomas' talks on race-issues awareness in scholarly and Baháʼí circles continued. In 1989 Thomas gave a day-long seminar on inter-cultural issues before the start of the 14th annual ABS conference. The 1990 15th ABS conference invited papers for presenting on "Models of racial unity" and Thomas was the convener to whom papers could be sent. In December 1990 Thomas was among the featured speakers at the sixth annual Grand Canyon Baháʼí Conference in Phoenix, Arizona, which some 1900 Baháʼís attended. In Feb 1991 Thomas was among the presenters at the North Shore Race Unity Task Force coalition in Evanston and Wilmette, Illinois, with the theme "Weekend for Racial Unity". Thomas was interviewed by Vernon Jarrett on his program the week before the conference, and was cosponsored to open the conference presentations at Northwestern University describing his forthcoming book "Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress" by the African American Studies Department. The book includes the first reference to the term "The Other Tradition", akin to the idea of Anti-racism, and a revised edition was published in 1993. This Task Force in Chicago had arisen in February 1990 when four Baháʼís from northern Illinois met. Intervening years had had increasing levels of action in the community. The group had most recently aided the city win an award from the National Association of Town Watch, the sponsors of National Night Out, and the Task Force was recognized by the Evanston Police Department for their efforts. The conference also held a panel discussion on "Racial Unity: Models That Work" including Thomas. The weekend's final event was a talk by Thomas at the Wilmette Baháʼí House of Worship entitled "An Agenda for Racial Unity and World Peace," drew an audience of about 200, many of whom had attended the other events that weekend.
There were about 75 Baháʼís in the area around Lansing in 1991. In June Ali Manning Thomas, son of Richard and June, won an international scholarship going to Japan. In October Thomas was a principal speaker at the fourth session of a Black-Jewish conference at MSU detailing the Jewish involvement in the civil rights movement, in the defense of the Scottsboro Boys, and the relationship between Thurgood Marshall and Jackson Greenberg.
In 1992 Thomas published "Life for Us is what We Make it: Building Black Community in Detroit, 1915–1945". It was a revised and updated work based on his PhD thesis, called "ambitious" though it also had numerous errors according to a review as well as not following the standard thought on black history of using proletarianization as an organizing principle, though Thomas was an early scholar in the subject, and now focused on community building, instead, as the basis of analysis. However others found it very worthwhile, though sometimes too prone to rhetoric and limited engagement of other interests in the progress of the times. That year the Thomas' were also noted attending the Baháʼí World Congress. A year later Thomas contributed to a series of monthly meetings held by Baháʼís from Detroit and Grosse Pointe, Michigan, with a talk "Overcoming Racial Prejudice: Baháʼí and Other Working Models". Thomas published a revised edition of "Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress " through the Association of Baháʼí Studies in 1993. In November Will C. van den Hoonaard used it as a reference in a race unity and racism draft for an encyclopedic article, and called it the "best analysis of factors that contribute to racial unity, integrating Baháʼí and non-Baháʼí perspectives". Another review was published in 1997. June was noted at a discussion of city planning integrating her scholarly and Baháʼí-based ideas.
In January 1994 Thomas' "Life for Us is what We Make it" was briefly reviewed in the local newspaper, and in May Thomas was among a panel of Baháʼís invited to a show on WLNS-TV. In 1995 June was a full professor at MSU (up to 2007).
More on the "other tradition".
1996 opened with Thomas' book "Understanding interracial unity: a study of U.S. race relations" published through SAGE Publications as part of two academic series: Sage series on race and ethnic relations and the Sage Yearbooks in Women's Policy Studies. The text received mixed reviews in a number of journals. Later that year the Universal House of Justice asked groups of Baháʼís to go to places around the world – such as African Americans to Africa; 9 members of the Black Men's Group(BMG) went in 1997 to Namibia and other places and successively beyond Africa each year and much of the time a 3 day stay at the Baháʼí World Center afterwards. After starting with 9 participants they ended with 53 the last year of that practice. 1996 was also the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience (MRULE) project, partly as a response to the tensions raised following the OJ Simpson trial/verdict in Oct 1995. Thomas was approached by then provost Lou Anna Simon of MSU to have a means of resolving racial tensions in the midst of increasing diversity on campus. There were indeed riots on campus in several years to come.
In 1997 a chapter by Thomas was published in "Social justice philanthropy" published by JAI Press entitled "The role of the American Baháʼí community in addressing racial injustice and racial disunity". The text is a broad review of nonprofit support for social justice and highlights the contribution and complexities of religious institutions in that light. Thomas mentions quickly the Antislavery movement of the Quakers, Mahatma Gandhi's Satyagraha, and its inspiration to Martin Luther King Jr. He then draws attention to the Baháʼí Faith's priority of justice as a core spiritual principle and details specific instances in Baháʼí history on the activities of Baháʼís in this area both locally and administratively, by leadership and individuals and in ways to keep the black population highlighted still in the then current iteration of the initiatives of the community and facing the subsequent resurgent racism in society responded to by the revised national and international institutions speaking out on the issue. The same year June came out with her own book, "Redevelopment and Race: Planning a Finer City in Postwar Detroit". Also since 1997, (and to 2011,) Thomas had often been elected annually to the Regional Baháʼí Council of what was at first called the Central States and later called the Regional Baháʼí Council for the Great Lakes States. June's father Hubert V. Manning also died in 1997, and June was named Director of the Urban and Regional Planning Program M.S.U. (to 2000.)
1998 seems to have been quiet for the Thomas' – but in 1999 June was named Director of the Urban Collaborators Program at MSU Extension (to 2001,) and Thomas was the Hasan M. Balyuzi Memorial Lecturer for the ABS conference. The next year Thomas taught a series of classes on racial unity for the Wilmette Institute.
2000 was another quiet year of public comment on the Thomas'. In 2001 June was named Co-Director of the Urban Collaborators Program, MSU Extension (MSUE), and Co-Director of Urban Planning Partnerships, an outreach initiative. Thomas published in article "Interracial and Multiracial unity movements in the US: Models of World Peace", in World Order magazine, and Gavel's PhD reviewing the MRULE projects with Thomas as her thesis committee lead was accomplished. 
In 2002 a Lansing newspaper article profiled the poetry of Thomas and another "Richard" at MSU. That year Thomas also came out with another book, "Bridging Racial Divides in Michigan's Urban Communities", "develop(ing) a historical analysis of selected organizations and groups involved in bridging racial divides in two highly racially segregated metropolitan communities: the Detroit Metropolitan and the Benton Harbor/St. Joseph communities." That year June's mother Ethel A. Manning died in September.
In 2003 Thomas was noted on the dissertation committee of Wilbert Jenkins about post-Civil War Charleston, SC, and was inspirational to a master's degree student at MSU extending the review and work of MRULE.
Another "World Order" edition in 2004 included articles from Thomas and June each. Thomas also visited NAACP officials and the Seacoast African-American Cultural Center near Green Acre Baháʼí School for the centenary of the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905 that ended the Russo-Japanese War "to discuss Building Multi-Racial Communities."
In 2005 scholar Christopher Buck noted Thomas' interest in documenting the contributions of early black Baháʼí Alain Locke. Thomas also was recorded giving a talk based on a paper in Haifa, Israel, possibly during pilgrimage. The paper reviewed the circumstances of early black Baháʼís. Thomas' text "Understanding Interracial Unity" had been used in some courses at MSU and with MRULE one observer thought change in race relations was proceeding at MSU and some courses focused on Baháʼí inputs to the issue as well. Thomas also served in the Wilmette Institute, a Baháʼí study institution founded in 1995 to provide classes on the religion that has moved to a largely online study approach of some 50 courses for thousands of students from approaching 100 countries.
In 2006 June worked in the Planners of Color Interest Group project and then was founding co-chair, in its organization as part of ACSP (Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning), while "Lights of the Spirit: Historical Portraits of Black Baháʼís in North America, 1898–2004", came out the long mentioned text reviewing many early black Baháʼís to which Thomas was a contributing co-editor and wrote three chapters;
That year Thomas also published a review of "The Last War – Racism, Spirituality, and the Future of Civilization" which he thought was on its way to being a classic in the field of the scholarly review of racism and the need for presenting spirituality in academic circles.
In 2007 June was named Centennial Professor of the Urban and Regional Planning Program at the University of Michigan. At MSU Thomas contributed to a book "The State of black Michigan, 1967–2007". and his poetry was anthologized by Amiri Baraka and Larry Neal.
Thomas was on the planning committee for the second "Black religion &amp; spirituality in the 21st century" in Nov 2007 at MSU, and held a session featuring the book "Lights of the spirit: historical portraits of black Baháʼís in North America, 1898–2004".
In 2007 Thomas and June joined son Ali in a letter to editor of the "Annals of Internal Medicine" about racism in medical practice.
Thomas was part of a panel discussion, the "Second Annual Louis Gregory Symposium on Race Unity", at Huston-Tillotson University sponsored by the Baháʼís of Austin, Austin Area Interreligious Ministries, Huston-Tillotson University, and the Student Government Association in 2008.
In 2009 Thomas contributed a talk for Black history month with a recorded presentation at Grand Rapids Community College commenting on the election of President Obama. Thomas cooperated in an October 2010 conference co-sponsored and organized by ABS and the Office of Communications of the National Spiritual Assembly of the United States held at Louhelen Baháʼí School.
Retired academic and active Baháʼí.
In 2011-2 Thomas retired from MSU, then living in Ypsilanti. He was still a PhD advisor directly and indirectly. MRULE was studied at MSU as well.
In 2012 Thomas appeared on the radio show The Takeaway interviewed by Celeste Headlee on "The Other Tradition" theme for a conference on race unity with William Smith and the role of "amity". Then Thomas took part in the Wilmette Institute course Social Action and Public Discourse. That year a BMG history was published. It lasted 25 years as a national Baháʼí organization with the goal of raising up black men for service in the religion. The annual meeting of the group grew to 200, started having to limit attendance, and then devolved regionalized meetings. In 2012 the international governing body of the Baháʼís, the Universal House of Justice, commended the fact that black men had been energized and could localize the process and ended the national group.
In 2013 June was president Association of Collegiate Schools of Planning (after being a rising officer since 2011,) and Thomas co-wrote "Detroit: Race Riots, Racial Conflicts, and Efforts to Bridge the Racial Divide".
Thomas gave a talk for the Civic, Literary, and Mutual Aid Associations in Detroit in 2013, and was plenary speaker for the ABS meeting.
A video interview with Richard Thomas was done at the ABS conference in 2013 "about scholarship, learning, and action in the field of race relations." Thomas also had a book published "Communication and Disenfranchisement: Social Health Issues and Implications". Thomas and Joe Darden presented on black history and riots in Detroit for the African American and African Studies section at MSU, and a documentary on BMG released.
In 2014 Thomas was noted supporting black women scholarship, was given an award by the Michigan historical society, and presented at the National Conference on Race Amity Forum.
In 2015 Thomas gave a talk at the Ann Arbor Washtenaw Community College on "The Other Tradition" theme.
In 2017 Thomas appeared with his co-writer on several projects, Joe Darden, at the Association of American Geographers, and also published a review of Louis Venters "No Jim Crow Church: The Origins of South Carolina's Baháʼí Community". He made a presentation on the BMG, and was videotaped as part of a Baháʼí review of struggling with issues of racism about a university-wide discussion program to teach acceptance of diversity to college faculty and students.
Projects.
Across Thomas' life he's also engaged in particular acts of service in various circumstances.
In 1969 as a MSU senior Thomas co-founded a black aid program on campus. In 1979 Thomas was an associate professor of racial and ethnic studies and was part of the department's new program in the study of human rights including black history and persecution.
1996 was the beginning of the implementation of the Multi-Racial Unity Living Experience(MRULE) project. Thomas co-established the MRULE project following the OJ Simpson trial/verdict in Oct 1995. Thomas was approached by then provost Lou Anna Simon of MSU to have a means of resolving racial tensions in the midst of increasing diversity on campus. Thomas brought in Jeanne Gazel, a current graduate student and their small consulting business. MRULE then began to evolve as it ran in the residence halls and introduced the basic concept of the organic oneness of humanity, tools for discussion-based engagement, and multiple degrees from studying the process. Gavel's PhD reviewing the MRULE projects with Thomas as her thesis committee lead was finished in 2001 as well as inspiring parallel research elsewhere.
Thomas has done scholarly work on a theme he named "The Other Tradition" after many years of teaching issues of race. He had been teaching race relations at MSU such as a class "Racism and ethnocentrism". After about 15 years of teaching the class he was concerned about dejected students and uncovered instances of cooperation and respect across the races that he felt was not being documented. He also felt scholars had focused on the violence and oppression to the exclusion of instances of cooperation. He first specifically began to entertain the work in 1981 at a conference at the University of Warwick where he offered a paper on interracial groups that formed after riots in Detroit noting in particular the fluidity in racial connections – and also met with resistance that such groups formed. He observed that fellow scholars and students in classes did not believe actual instances of interracial cooperation which lead him to contribute a chapter in "Detroit: Race and Uneven Development" from 1987. He "felt compelled to include the history of "The Other Tradition" of American race relations, namely: the history of the interracial struggle for racial justice, unity, love, and fellowship. People needed to know, I reasoned, both the history of racism and the history of those who have struggled against racism and have envisioned a social order in which people not only accept each other as equal but also have a profound appreciation of each other as members of the one human family." "Racial Unity: An Imperative for Social Progress" from 1991 and revised in 1993, was the first publication to use the term "The Other Tradition". In this theme, Thomas includes mention of Bacon's Rebellion, black and white soldiers during the American Revolutionary War on the side of Britain, Abolitionism in the United States, black and white cooperation in the Underground Railroad, John Brown, black and white soldiers during the American Civil War, the Grimké sisters, the period of Knights of Labor and the general Reconstruction Era, the NAACP, the Baháʼí Faith, interracial coalition building in the democratic party, The Communist Party USA and African Americans, Highlander Folk School, Southern Conference for Human Welfare, and the Educational Fund it developed, the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples, the Civil Rights Movement, the "Beloved Community" of Martin Luther King Jr., Freedom Summer and the various freedom marches, the Detroit organization of "Focus Hope", and MRULE. Some reviewers of "Understanding interracial unity: a study of U.S. race relations" noted Thomas ignored the question of the effectiveness of efforts of interracial unity. One saw that and noticed Thomas saw increasing racism since the 1970s, and his effort was aimed at showcasing examples of people who worked for unity and "a tradition of courgeous struggle for racial justice" and working in a similar vein to other works though perhaps misjudging the virtue of protests. Another noted the question of effectiveness as well as the call for a critical mass multiracial group could "break the cycle of racial polarization and fragmentation" and noted institutions Thomas documented that contributed to interracial justice and unity but wanted more development of the cases and that the overall subject needs a broader grasp than individualist and psychology which could reach towards being effective. A couple briefer reviews noted the work as the "first in a decade" on the subject, and honest. Thomas also acknowledged he did not speak to the effectiveness of the efforts.

2018 East Timorese parliamentary election

Early parliamentary elections were held in East Timor on 12 May 2018 after the National Parliament was dissolved by President Francisco Guterres on 26 January 2018.
The Alliance for Change and Progress (AMP), a coalition of three opposition parties, won an absolute majority of 34 of the 65 seats in Parliament. Voter turnout was 81 percent, five percentage points higher than the previous year.
Background.
In the 2017 parliamentary elections there was no clear winner, with the Fretilin party of Mari Alkatiri holding only one more seat than the National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction led by Xanana Gusmão. Alkatiri formed a minority government with the Democratic Party, which held only 30 of the 65 seats in the National Parliament. However, the government's attempts to pass a budget were blocked, and amidst political deadlock, President Francisco Guterres dissolved Parliament and called for early elections.
Electoral system.
The 65 members of the National Parliament were elected from a single nationwide constituency by closed list proportional representation. Parties were required to have a woman in at least every third position in their list. Seats were allocated using the d'Hondt method with an electoral threshold of four percent.
Results.

James Bisset (Royal Navy officer)

Rear-Admiral James Bisset (1760–1824) was a Scottish commander in the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars.
Life.
He was born in 1760 the third son of Captain Thomas Bisset (1722-1763), and his wife Janet McArthur. Bisset was a friend and ally of Captain Cook. When James' father died in 1763 when James was only three it is thought that he went to live with cousins in Edinburgh.
James joined the Royal Navy in 1771 as a captain's servant to Cpt John Bentinck on HMS Centaur a guardship at Portsmouth. In October 1773 he was present when Bentinck entertained Benjamin Franklin on board and he famously demonstrated the calming of the water by pouring oil on it.
He joined the sloop HMS Wasp in 1775 and stayed with this ship until commissioned as a Lieutenant on 10 February 1778, then joining HMS Elizabeth under Cpt Frederick Maitland. In 1767 Maitland had married Bisset's first cousin,
Margaret Louisa Dick of Edinburgh.
In 1791 he was commanding the 16-gun HMS Swallow moving to 14-gun HMS Falcon, based in Jamaica, the following year. In 1793 he saw action in the English Channel, capturing several privateers, and was promoted to Post Captain in October 1794.
In 1795 he was given the far larger HMS Venerable, a 74-gun ship of the line, under Admiral Duncan in the North Sea.
On 23 December 1805 he sat on the panel of judges at Admiral Robert Calder's court-martial.
In 1811 his wife lived at Carnegie Street in south Edinburgh and in 1813 moved nearby to 174 Pleasance.
In December 1813 he was promoted to rear admiral.
His ultimate command was the highly prestigious 100-gun HMS Sovereign, which had famously seen action at the Battle of Trafalgar.
He is buried in New Calton Burial Ground in Edinburgh. He did not have any children.

Murder of Gabriel Cruz

The murder of Gabriel Cruz, also known as "Operación Nemo" refers to the events related to the disappearance of a child called Gabriel Cruz Ramírez in Spain. It took place on the afternoon of 27 February 2018 in the southern town of (Almería), where the child was murdered in a family cottage near the town of .
The eight-year-old boy disappeared somewhere on the way from his grandmother's house to his cousins', only 100 metres apart, and then he was missing for the next 12 days. A SAR service of over 5,000 people including 3,000 volunteers and 2,000 professionals was established. It was the largest coordinated search for a missing person in the history of Spain.
On 11 March, the body was found in the trunk of the vehicle of Ana Julia Quezada, who was the father's partner at the time. The alleged perpetrator had immediately prior to this dug up the child's body on a farm owned by the child's paternal family in . It was there that the murder had allegedly taken place on the same day of the disappearance. Ana Julia placed the body in the vehicle and drove to her home in . There, at the garage door, she was stopped by the Civil Guard, who had been monitoring her movements. Two days later, the defendant confessed to the crime.
The investigation of the case remains open and pending on legal ruling.
Context.
On Tuesday 27 February 2018 at (3.30 p.m.) Gabriel left the house and went to play at his cousins' house. To get to the family's house, he had to go through an unpaved dirt road and then cross the main street, but Gabriel disappeared before reaching his destination. According to the investigators, as the child had not come back at (6.00 p.m.), his grandmother went to the relatives' house and asked whether he was there. But they told her that Gabriel wasn't there and that in fact, he hadn't been there that afternoon. Then, neighbours started to look for him. His parents, who were not in town at the time, were alerted and they joined in the search for their son. Five hours later, at 8.30 p.m. and after realising that no one knew where the child was, his family raised the alarm.
Almost one week later, a white T-shirt was found about four kilometres from the place where Gabriel was last seen. The Spanish Minister of Home Affairs himself, Juan Ignacio Zoido, confirmed that the analyses carried out by the Laboratory of the Civil Guard revealed the presence of the missing child's DNA on the T-shirt. Later on, the outcome of the investigation would show that the discovery of the T-shirt was feigned by Gabriel’s alleged murderer. The fact that the clothing was almost dry when Anna Julia found it in spite of the previous rain, also gave the Civil Guard a clue.
On Friday, 9 March 2018, the Spanish press reported that two people claimed to have seen a van lurking around the area where the child’s track was lost.
Only two days later, Gabriel’s body was located inside another vehicle — the one owned by Ana Julia Quezada, his father’s girlfriend at the time.
Account of events.
Gabriel, Ángel David Cruz and Patricia Ramírez's son, disappeared in . The town has less than 100 inhabitants and is located in the heart of the Cabo de Gata natural park. 
The disappearance occurred somewhere along the short distance between his grandmother’s house and his cousins’. Nevertheless, the investigation of the Civil Guard spread over an area of six kilometres from the starting point and then, up to twelve kilometres in specific areas such as wells, old mines or uninhabited houses. The agents focused on Las Negras waterworks, near the place where Ana Julia pretended to find the T-shirt. A specialised team of divers searched Gabriel throughout the entire area. More than 625 kilometres and more than 500 points — including wells and cisterns, were combed in all. 
Another of the difficulties that investigators had to overcome was the lack of road or security cameras in Las Hortichuelas, where there are hardly any businesses such as restaurants, tobacco shops and banks. There is not even an ATM in the whole area. The nearest petrol stations are dozens of kilometres away. 
Finally, the arrest of Ana Julia Quezada took place in , 73 kilometres far from Las Hortichuelas.
The confessed murderer.
Ana Julia Quezada, arrested as the alleged perpetrator of Gabriel's murder, was Angel's partner. Born on 25 March, in Concepción de la Vega, Dominican Republic, she arrived in Spain in 1995, at the time she was 21, and settled in Burgos with a daughter born in her country when she was 17 years old. In 1996 her 4-year old daughter, Ridelca Josefina Gil Quezada fell through a window on the seventh floor where they lived and died. The incident was then closed as an accidental death, but authorities announced that it would be reinvestigated after Gabriel's murder.
Her arrest occurred when dozens of agents cut off her vehicle as she was about to enter a garage of an apartment block in the town of La Puebla de Vicar. After that, when they opened the trunk, investigators found Gabriel Cruz's body.
Although she initially stated that she was not guilty, she would finally confessed the crime two days later. She was charged with murder, kidnapping and crimes against .
During her first appearance before the head of the Court of Instruction number 5 in Almería, Rafael Soriano, the detainee stuck to the declaration made before the Civil Guard, in which she said there was an argument and a struggle for an axe before she suffocated the child to death and hid his body in the country house of Rodalquilar where she kidnapped the child. This version was partially taken apart by the investigators in their official account of the facts, in which it is quoted:The defendant murdered Gabriel herself, without any other person; she took the child possibly because of the jealousy she had for him; she killed him the day of his abduction, suffocating him, and buried him by covering him with decorative stones and planks.As the Lieutenant Colonel, Accidental Chief of the Civil Guard Command of Almeria, José Hernández Mosquera, stated a posteriori, Ana Julia was suspected practically from the beginning of the investigation. Even so, the agents always believed she had Gabriel alive and their goal was to get her to take them to the little boy. But Gabriel was killed the same day he disappeared, as the autopsy confirmed.
On 3 March, an essential event occurred that would later help to solve the case: Ana Julia staged the appearance of the t-shirt worn by the minor; she said she found it about four kilometres far from Las Hortichuelas. To do this, she had to go through a piece of land, arrive in Las Negras and enter a gully, something that was quite implausible for the researchers. It is worth mentioning that she was the one who told Angel to go and look around the area, and it was her who found the t-shirt. Angel was nearby but not in sight at the time of the alleged discovery. The family recognized it as Gabriel's shirt.
According to the Civil Guard, the T-shirt was a sign that the defendant wanted to do to his partner in time so as to give him hope. Near the place where the child was found lived Ana Julia’s former partner and, in all likelihood, she thought that researchers would direct their inquests towards that person, but it proved to be unsuccessful. 
On the 11th, Ana Julia went to Rodalquiar house, while she was under close surveillance. The officers saw her pulling some planks, some stones out the garden, as well as a body that apparently belonged to a small person who fit Gabriel’s profile. She put it in the trunk and left for Almería; she passed through Almería and arrived in Vícar. It was then that the research team decided to arrest her when she got out of the car, looking in the trunk and finding Gabriel’s body wrapped in a blanket. Apparently, the body was in good condition, and the child was half-naked, wearing only underwear.
While she was in jail, the prisoner statement was taken and she confess in front of her lawyer that she was responsible for the killing, giving some details such as the fact that she had thrown Gabriel’s clothes in a glass container in the Spanish town . The agents examined the area and found them, except for the T-shirt.
The murderer's relationship with Angel and Gabriel's family.
Ana Julia actively participated in Gabriel's search and she seemed sad for what had happened. She even talked to the media, cried, feigned and comforted her partner. The Civil Guard revealed that she was giving Angel large Diazepam doses, an anxiolytic, to calm him down and make him forget about what had happened. She had also tried to persuade him to go to Dominican Republic for weeks, but he refused. “Don't worry, Angel. When we find "Gabrielito" and once this is over, we’ll get married”, she told him repeatedly.
Impact.
Gabriel Cruz’s case shocked the Spanish society. Two days before the body was found, an important demonstration took place in Almería to claim the child’s return. His parents said that Gabriel loved fish, that he liked drawing them and that he wanted to become a marine biologist. Since then, the symbol of a small fish filled windows, schools, public centres and social networks all over the country so as to support them.

Booger Bear

Booger Bear was an album released by The Buddy Miles Express in 1973. It was released in both stereo and quadraphonic formats. It made the "Billboard" charts in 1974.
Background.
The album received a positive review in the November 23, 1973 issue of "Billboard". The reviewer referred to it as a production of the first order with time and care being put into the selections. The songs "Why" and "United Nations Stomp", both composed by Miles were singled out as solid entries. The album was also released in the Quadraphonic SQ Matrix. A review in the February, 24 issue "Billboard" for Quadrasonic albums mentioned the spectrum being opened up by the Columbia sound engineers. It also made the distinction between this album and most of the others that relied on the "Front" stereo approach, with the music in "Booger Bear" actually surrounding the listener.
The album was a "Billboard", FM Action Pick for KAFM-FM and KNAC-FM in early December, 1973, and a pick for WNEW-FM the following week.
Spending three weeks on the Billboard 200 chart, the album peaked at #194 on January 26, 1974.
In 2010, the album was released on CD on the Wounded Bird label. In 2019, the UK label Dutton Vocalion released a double CD/SACD hybrid of "Booger Bear" and "Carlos Santana &amp; Buddy Miles! Live!" with the CD content in stereo and the SACD layers offering the original multichannel quadraphonic mixes of each album.

Castle of Ayora

The Castle of Ayora is located at an elevation of 552 (1,811 ft) metres above mean sea level (mamsl), in the centre of Ayora, a Valencian town. Built probably in the mid 13th century, after the Reconquista, on an ancient Arabian building. The architectural ensemble was composed of the four-storey residence-palace, two fortified towns, and one large keep, as well as other rooms for the soldiers and serfdom, aljibes (European Middle Ages castle cisterns that collected the rain water to provide drinking water to the castles) and gardens. This was surrounded by around 0.62 miles (1,000 m) of defensive walls and defensive towers.
The castle was reduced to ruins by the troops of Philip V of Spain, in the War of the Spanish Succession, but its profile and its vast size are still noticeable. The keep, of square plan, the "Puerta Falsa" (Fake Door), commissioned by the Marchioness of Cenete in the 16th century on which it was her coat of arms, as well as paintings, defensive walls, buckets, moats, and cisterns, stand out in the remains of the castle.
Since 2006, it is a Bien de Interés Cultural (property of cultural interest) with reference RI-51-0010507.
History.
It is of Muslim origin and was rebuilt in its entirety in the 13th century after the Valle de Cofrentes was regained by the Aragonese troops between 1239 and 1243. With the signing of the Treaty of Almizra in 1244 between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon, the Castilians take over Ayora. Ayora is in hands of the Aragonese again, as a war reparation, by the Treaty of Campillo signed in 1281 between Alfonso X the Wise of Castile and Peter III the Great of Aragon.
Ayora was part of The Kingdom of Valencia once again by decision of James II the Just, the king of Aragon, by means of the Treaty of Elche in 1305.
The first reference of the castle comes precisely from the Muslim geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi who mentioned it in passing in the 12th century.
With the decree of expulsion of the Moriscos in 1609, the valley was practically depopulated, after they had rebelled against the royal power.
During the 14th century and 15th century, Ayora was a place of feudal manor, it was property of the admiral of Aragon Bernardo de Sarriá. In 1492 it was bought by Don Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar y Mendoza (son of Cardinal Mendoza), first Marquis of Cenete, who died in 1523. His daughter Mencía de Mendoza, Marchioness of Cenete, (Jadraque, 1508 - Valencia, 1554) inherited the manor, but when she died without descendants it passed into the hands of her sister María, who was married Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Duke of the Infantado, being united to its dominions until 1837, when the feudal regimes were abolished.
During the 16th century and 17th century, the castle underwent important alterations in order to refurbish it as a palace, including the construction of the so-called "Puerta Falsa", commissioned by Lady Mencía de Mendoza.
The castle is practically in ruins since in 1707 the troops of Philip V of Spain, under the command of the Count of Pinto, took by assault, looting and burning the town and the castle, and people left the castle. In 1797 the botanist Antonio Jose Cavanillles gave a description of it and presented it as a ruined and destroyed place (observations collected by the geographer and botanist Cavanilles in his work "Observaciones...del Reino de Valencia"). In 1812 the French occupied the valley and finished with the remains of the castle that were left.
The town of Ayora, located at the foot of the castle, was in turn walled, having three doors or accesses: the Portal of the Virgen de Gracia, the Portal of Santa Lucia, and the Portal of Palaz or San Nicolás.
Architecture.
Built on a lengthened floor plan, it is adapted to the land on which it is raised. Just in the middle of the castle and being dominant over the landscape, a four-sided tower is erected. Made using masonry and ashlar construction procedures, there are still remainders of rammed earth from some prior Muslim structures.
It has two strongholds. The bigger one known as Plaza de Armas with geometrically designed pebble pavement and the smaller one, located in the south, considered to be the patio of the previous fortress/palace of the Marchioness of Cenete.
The castle was surrounded by 6-metre-high and 900-metre-long ramparts. Among the ruins, remains from several four-cornered towers and from a semicircular one may be found. Moreover, there are rests of antique rooms.
The castle had two entrances. The Northern one was accessible by crossing the well-known "Barrio Alto" (The High Suburb). The Southern one by the well-known "Puerta Falsa" (16th Century) which straightaway gave way to the palace.
Despite its current difficult access, it used to be the main entry to the castle. It is known as "Puerta Falsa", due to the fact that at the present time it does not play that role, since a quarry was placed before it.
The door had a semicircular arch and it was built with reddish limestone ashlars. The door is framed by an asymmetrical stone coving in the shape of the architectonic adornment called alfiz, above which was supposedly the coat of arms of the owners of the castle. Nowadays, its location is unknown.
The coat of arms was likely to be of the Marquisate of Cenete. On the right side of the door there are remains of what presumably was a baseboard ornamenting the wall and simulating a column built in the wall with a capital at the top and a column base. Above the door there are two corbels that held a machicolation, currently missing, which protected the entry from attacks.

Imamzadeh Mausoleum () is mosque on the Imamli street in the central part of the city of Shamakhi. It is the oldest mosque in the territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan. The mosque was registered by Ministry of Culture and Tourism of Azerbaijan Republic as a historical and cultural monument of the country.
History.
Abbasgulu Bakikhanov mentioned in his famous Gulistani-Iram work in 1841: "In many ways, the ruins of the village and the high-ranking three imamzadehs in the cities of Shamakhi, Ganja and Barda, as well as Imamzadeh in the Bulbule village show that this country has always been the homeland of the religious elders"
The mausoleum was built on the tomb of one of the sons of the fourth imam, Zeynalabdin – Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris. Also, Seyid Mirmehdi Agha Seyidali oghlu, who had worked here as akhund for a long time, was buried here in 1911. The mosque was built in 1370 and was reconstructed on the basis of project of Zivar bey Ahmadbayov in 1910–1917. Generally, the mosque is supposed to be built five times. In 1991 it was restored under leadership of akhund, Haji Elshan Rustamov. It is possible that 400 people can worship here at the same time.
The mosque complex consists of three parts – pilgrimage (Allama Seyyid Mohammed Saleh al-Madirris was buried there), place of worship and hoseyniyeh.

Piano Quintet No. 1 (Fauré)

Gabriel Fauré's Piano Quintet in D minor, Op. 89 is the first of his two works in the genre. Dedicated to Eugène Ysaÿe, the quintet was given its premiere in Brussels by the Quatuor Ysaÿe, with the composer at the piano, on 23 March 1906. The gestation of the work was long and effortful: Fauré started work on it in 1887 and repeatedly set it aside and returned to it until he completed it in 1905.
Background.
In 1887, shortly after the premiere of his Second Piano Quartet, Fauré told a friend that he found himself "haunted by an idea for another work for piano and strings". He rarely kept sketches for his works once they were complete, but a sketchbook dating from mid-1887 survives, containing the theme that was to form the work's finale. Fauré's biographer Jean-Michel Nectoux speculates that the idea of incorporating the theme into a piano quintet may have been prompted by the friendship between the composer and the violinist Eugène Ysaÿe, with whom he gave concerts in 1888 and 1889, and to whom the quintet is dedicated. In late 1890 Fauré sketched out most of the quintet, but was unsatisfied with it, and laid it aside in favour of two song cycles – the "Cinq mélodies "de Venise"" (1891) and "La Bonne chanson" (1892–1894). He returned to it in 1894, but again set it aside. The quintet was not completed until 1905. The first performance was in Brussels on 23 March 1906 by the Ysaÿe Quartet with the composer at the piano. The Ysaÿe Quartet and the pianist Raoul Pugno gave the work its first Paris performance the following month at the Salle Pleyel. The score was published by Schirmer in 1907.
Structure.
The work is scored for piano and standard string quartet. There are three movements. The playing time of the quintet is generally about 30 minutes.
1. Molto moderato.
The piano opens the work alone, with high arpeggios which Roger Nichols calls "creditable harp imitations". The strings join in with the modal first theme, ascending and then descending – "at the same time memorable and disturbing", in Nectoux's phrase. The second theme announced fortissimo by the strings alone, is contrastingly more emphatic and rhythmic:
The three notes at A, above, recur during the movement as a motif, and are heard again in the slow movement.
The themes are developed, with constant harmonic changes, and the movement ends gently after a coda using a new theme derived from both the first and second. The tempo marking for the movement in the published score is crochet=69, which Nichols suggests is a misprint for crochet=96, which is closer to the tempo usually adopted.
The opening movement is seen by Fauré scholars as among the composer's finest compositions: for Nectoux it is "perhaps the most beautiful in the whole of his chamber music"; for Robert Orledge it is "one of Fauré's best, radiant with life and intensity"; Aaron Copland praises its technical mastery and comments that it "must convince the most recalcitrant ear of Faure's great powers of melody-making".
2. Adagio.
The central slow movement opens in A minor, with the first theme played by the first violin to the accompaniment of undulating repeated chords on the piano. A secondary, contemplative theme is introduced by the piano, after which the lower strings have a more agitated third melody against the piano's rapid semiquavers. The themes are developed, leading to a central section in D-flat major, which begins tranquilly and gradually increases in intensity. The piano repeats the motif theme from the first movement, before the opening subject of the movement returns. After a brief return of the peaceful theme of the middle section, the movement closes, as it began, in A minor.
The movement has divided opinion among Fauré's admirers. For Copland, in spite of "an expressive middle section" its was "one of Fauré's lesser creations". Nectoux finds the opening berceuse theme "has something rather indefinite about it". For Orledge the movement is "unified and forward-looking" with "a timeless quality to it".
3. Allegretto moderato.
The finale is the first example in Fauré's work of a sonata rondo, a form he favoured in subsequent works. It begins with what the analyst Paul Conway calls "a bright, marching D major theme" for the piano, accompanied by pizzicato strings. This is followed by a bowed counter-subject. The strings then take up the piano theme. After a passage in B minor with leaping octaves, the first theme returns, blending with the second and then restated in pianissimo triplets before rising to a D major climax.
Like the slow movement, the finale has divided critical opinion. Orledge thinks that parts of it are "not among his happiest inspirations" and suggests that Fauré rushed to complete it while coping with his duties as newly-appointed Director of the Paris Conservatoire. Nectoux praises "the formal strength of this last movement":

Geely Boyue

The Geely Boyue () is a compact crossover SUV produced by the Chinese automaker Geely.
Overview.
The Boyue was originally planned to be launched as part of the Emgrand series during development, the Boyue was launched as an independent product under the Geely brand on 26 March 2016. In the South American market, this SUV is offered under the name Geely Emgrand X7 Sport, being integrated into the Geely Emgrand product subdivision. 
The Boyue was designed by a team led by Peter Horbury, the vehicle’s exterior design combines traditional Chinese cultural elements with modern languages of fashion. Since its launch, the Boyue has received much attention in the Chinese automobile market. The Boyue was facelifted in 2018. After 36 months, the total production number was 700,000. With the evolving world of car designs and refreshes, the Boyue name has spawned another new variant on top of the regular Boyue and Boyue Pro. At the Chengdu Motor Show in August 2021, Geely unveiled the Boyue X with the company's latest design language.
Boyue Pro.
The facelifted version dubbed the Boyue Pro debuting in China in July 2019 featuring restyled front and rear end designs. The Boyue Pro interior features the new GKUI infotainment system, all new cabin design and a new option of 1.5-litre turbo engine that co-developed with Volvo which is same as one's in Geely Binyue. The Boyue Pro is exported to overseas markets as the Geely Azkarra.
Boyue X.
The Geely Boyue X was unveiled at the 2021 Chengdu Auto Show as another variant based on the Boyue Pro introduced over two years ago. The Boyue X is equipped with the same powertrain as the Boyue Pro while the front and rear end received redesigns as the first model introduced with Geely’s Vision Starburst design language.
Proton X70.
On 24 May 2017, PROTON Holdings parent company DRB-HICOM announced plans to sell a 49.9% stake in Proton to Zhejiang Geely Automobile Holdings. Alongside the sale of stake, it was announced that Proton's first SUV would be based on the Geely Boyue. The Proton X70 launched in Malaysia in December 2019. 
It was fully imported from China and featured only minor cosmetic changes inside and out. The most apparent change is that the Proton X70 is right-hand drive while the Geely Boyue is a left-hand drive vehicle. Proton started the local assembly of the X70 in December 2019 with the launch in February 2020.
The Proton X70 was launched in Pakistan in December 2020.
Farizon FX.
The Geely Farizon FX is a 4-door pickup truck based on the Boyue Pro. It features a monocoque design similar to the Hyundai Santa Cruz instead of a traditional ladder frame layout like most pickup trucks. It is powered by the same 1.8 litre turbo engine for the Boyue Pro. The truck is claimed to be the first car-based truck in China. The design retains the Boyue Pro's front fascia except the Expanding Cosmos grille. The rear is replaced by a truck bed with an integrated sport bar, wood flooring and a tonneau cover. The interior is largely different from it's counterpart, as it has a larger centre console and a slightly different dashboard layout.

Piano Quintet No. 2 (Fauré)

Gabriel Fauré's Piano Quintet in C minor, Op. 115, is the second of his two works in the genre and his last four-movement chamber work. Dedicated to Paul Dukas, the quintet was given its premiere in Paris at a concert of the Société nationale de musique on 21 May 1921. It was an immediate success and has always been more popular than the First Quintet, completed sixteen years earlier.
Background.
Fauré began working on his Second Piano Quintet in 1919 at Annecy-le-Vieux in Savoy, during his summer holiday from his duties as Director of the Paris Conservatoire. He was 74, increasingly deaf, and nearing the end of his time as director. From Annecy he wrote to his wife, who remained in Paris, "as yet there are only sketches, so for the moment I'm not speaking of it to anyone". Fauré was a slow, painstaking composer and the quintet took months of work, although by comparison with the first quintet – on which he worked intermittently for 18 years – it was completed relatively quickly. The middle movements were finished first, during a long summer holiday at Annecy in 1920. His reluctant retirement from the Conservatoire at the end of September 1920 left him more time for composition, which he found a great benefit in completing the quintet. The finished manuscript is dated March 1921, although the Fauré scholar Robert Orledge suggests that it was probably completed in Nice the previous month.
The work was premiered at a concert of the Société nationale de musique in the concert hall of the Conservatoire on 21 May 1921 by what Orledge calls "a distinguished group of devoted Faureans". The players were Robert Lortat (piano), André Tourret and Victor Gentil (violins), Maurice Vieux (viola) and Gérard Hekking (cello).
Structure.
The work is scored for piano and standard string quartet. There are four movements. The playing time is generally between 30 and 35 minutes. (See timings in Recordings section, below.)
1. Allegro moderato.
As in the first quintet, the opening is characterised by piano arpeggios, but now in the bass register: as the Fauré scholar Roger Nichols puts it, "no longer ethereal, but earthy and urgent". Over the arpeggios the strings enter one by one, as in the first quintet, led here by the viola with the principal theme of the first movement. The first violin then introduces a more rhythmically marked figure. The two themes are interwoven, with shifts of key. The development section is not severely polyphonic like its predecessor in the first quintet, but calm and flowing. The opening theme makes an emphatic reappearance in its original key, and is further developed, with a passage in octaves for the first violin. After a last appearance of the second theme the movement ends with a coda in C major.
2. Allegro vivo.
The Allegro vivo second movement is a scherzo, the first of the four movements to be written. It opens with rapid scale figuration in the piano, later joined by the strings. A more lyrical theme in an arching shape follows for the strings, and the movement concludes with the two themes combined. Nichols comments that this movement is one of Faure's "most astonishing inventions, pushing tonality as far as he would ever take it and (as any pianist will testify) subverting habitual finger patterns".
3. Andante moderato.
The analyst Michael Struck-Schloen describes the slow movement as "a grand two-part song with a coda [which] builds a bridge between Beethoven's late string quartets and Wagner's "Tristan" in its string introduction". After the expressive first theme, the piano enters and introduces a second theme, with the strings accompanied by off-beat piano chords. The strings return to the first theme in the development section and the second theme returns. The movement concludes in its original G major, after what Nichols calls "playful … intimations of a final cadence some twenty-five bars before it finally arrives".
4. Allegro molto.
As in the first movement, the viola introduces the first theme, an arching melody against syncopated octaves on the piano that has something in common with the opening theme of the first movement. A second theme is given to piano and viola, and after the return of the first theme, a third emerges. The three elements interplay, rondo-style, and then combine before a C major coda.
Critical reception.
The work was a success from its premiere onwards. The music critic of "Le Figaro" wrote of "l'énorme succès" and the loud cheers of the audience:
The critic Émile Vuillermoz described the quintet as "a work of incomparable nobility". and said that the score profoundly honoured French art and gave young artists hope for the future. Another leading critic, Louis Vuillemin, called it a masterpiece and wrote of "A deep and magnificent serenity of a great poet, wise and lyrical. ... There is not in this second quintet the slightest trace of externality, the slightest sound effect, the slightest concession, even unconscious, to fashions and ways. There is nothing but pure music, stripped of artifice". In 1924 Aaron Copland wrote:
In 1922 Durand et fils published the score and also a reduction for piano duet. The published score is dedicated to Fauré's friend and Parisian near neighbour, the composer Paul Dukas.

2018 Ouagadougou attacks

On 2 March 2018, at least eight heavily armed militants launched an assault on key locations throughout Ouagadougou, the capital city of Burkina Faso. Targets included the French embassy and the headquarters of Burkina Faso's military.
Background.
In the aftermath of the 2011 Libyan Civil War, militant attacks have increased due to a large influx of weapons and fighters into the region. Neighbouring Mali faced conflict in Azawad that threatened to split the country. Since 2015, Burkina Faso has faced cross-border attacks and sporadic raids in its territory, the result of instability and unrest in neighboring countries. Two major attacks have occurred in the capital Ouagadougou in recent years: In 2016, attacks on a hotel and restaurant killed 30 people, including foreigners; and in 2017, similar attacks killed 19 people, including foreigners. Both of these attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.
Burkina Faso also faced an uprising in 2014 leading to the downfall of President Blaise Compaoré later that year. Burkina Faso is a member of the Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Partnership and its commitment of peacekeeping troops in Mali and Sudan has made it a target for extremists in the region.
Attacks.
At around 10:00 a.m., the attackers began their assault on the military headquarters, detonating a car bomb in an apparent attempt at targeting a meeting of senior officers. The blast destroyed one room in the building. Shortly after the assault on the army headquarters, gunmen converged on the French embassy, exchanging fire with local security forces and French special forces soldiers. The French Institute, a cultural organisation located in the city, was targeted as well according to an embassy statement. Local police believes that "Islamic extremists" were behind the attack, which involved the use of gunfire and at least one car bomb. Many of the gunmen were also reportedly wearing army uniforms. Five of the militants were killed at the embassy, and at least three others were killed near the army headquarters, according to Communications Minister Remy Danjuinou. Eight soldiers have been killed, and 85 others wounded.
To the west of the capital, heavy smoke rose from the army joint chief of staff’s office, where unnamed witnesses reported loud explosions. Windows were broken there and in the surrounding buildings.
Perpetrators.
The day after the attack, the group Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), an affiliate group of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb led by Iyad Ag Ghaly, claimed responsibility for the attack, calling it retaliation for a previous raid during Operation Barkhane by the French army in northern Mali.
On 5 March, the group released a picture of the suicide bomber who detonated the explosives at the army headquarters, identifying him as Yunus al-Fulani.
On 7 March, eight people were arrested in connection to the attack including two military officers.

Mochama was a 2013 resident poet at the Ca’Foscari University, Venezia, Italy and a 2019 Emily Harvey Foundation resident writer in Venice, Italy. He has also visited Canada, London, Portugal and (Germany) under different literary activities as a speaker, reader and facilitator.
Court case.
In 2014, Mochama was accused of sexually assaulting the Asian-Kenyan poet and feminist activist Shailja Patel. Prof. Wambui Mwangi led the public uproar, which permeated Twitter for days, following the accusation. Later, the Nairobi CID overturned the case by officially concluding it, as both malicious and an afterthought. Mochama then sued Shailja Patel and Prof. Wambui Mwangi for four million Kenyan shillings in punitive damage to his reputation, under the Civil Suit number 399 of 2015. It was announced on the 6th of August 2019 that a Kenyan court absolved and awarded Mochama 9 million shillings for defamation. The court has also ordered both Shalja Patel and Prof Wambui Mwangi to apologise to Mochama through the court within 14 days.

Kirknewton (Northumberland) railway station

Kirknewton railway station served the village of Kirknewton, Northumberland, England from 1887 to 1953 on the Cornhill Branch.
History.
The station opened on 5 September 1887 by the North Eastern Railway. It was situated on the north side of the B6351 approximately 1/4 mile from the village centre. The station closed to passengers on 22 September 1930 and to goods traffic on 30 March 1953, which was earlier than the northern part of the branch (in 1965). The station consisted of one passenger platform, as well as a marshalling yard for local freight. The bridge crossing the College Burn, a short way west of the station was damaged in floods in 1948, along with a bridge that was washed away near Mindrum.
Today.
Both the station building itself and the former Station Master's house are still in existence as private dwellings.
The original signal box also remains, now converted into a storage shed. There is also a prefabricated Nissen Hut and shed in the grounds of the Station Master's house.
The course of the permanent way (track since removed) can be clearly seen to the west and east of the station. Much of this is now used for farming purposes.

Scorched Earth (2018 film)

Scorched Earth is a 2018 Canadian-American post-apocalyptic science fiction/action film directed by Peter Howitt starring Gina Carano.
Plot.
In the not-too-distant future, the world is ravaged by brutal climate changes, colloquially known as the Cloud Fall. The combination of pollution and relentless mining of Earth's resources through industrialism has left the environment nearly unlivable and extremely hostile to human habitation. Humanity is forcefully reverted to a simpler lifestyle, relying on barter for the two most valuable resources now: Water purifiers, called tabs, and silver, ground up to line the interior of breathing masks, to keep out a painful and fatal airborne disease known as Black Lung.
Driving vehicles that use fossil fuel becomes outlawed. Anyone caught driving such a vehicle was given the maximum sentence, and numerous people have become bounty hunters, bringing in drivers and other lawbreakers in exchange for tabs and silver, dead or alive. Gage, a bounty hunter, tortures Womack, a follower of an outlaw named Chavo, leaves him in the wilderness, then locates and kills Chavo after a brutal fight, freeing several pilgrims in the process. She brings the body back to claim the reward from Sheriff Grubbs, a slightly corrupt and greedy lawman of New Montana. While there, she visits Doc, her mentor and friend. He tells her of a massive reward for Thomas Jackson, an unusually industrious outlaw who is building a shelter-town for criminals, calling it Defiance. Gage decides she wants to try taking him down alone. Doc warns that every bounty hunter that tried has been killed and strung up as a warning to other would-be bounty hunters.
Masquerading herself as Chavo, Gage makes it into Defiance unchallenged. Jackson's right-hand man, Lear, is distrustful of Gage, but is unable to prove anything, and Gage endears herself to Jackson by saving his life when Grubbs and a posse sneak into Defiance to try taking him out. Jackson decides to include Gage in his plans, which includes enslaving the entire region to work in the silver mines near his town, he offers Gage 15% of the cut of the profits in exchange for her services as a gunfighter, and unintentionally revealing a scar on his forearm, which Gage's sister had made when she bit him, before he killed her. Shortly after, Jackson took Gage, Lear and several men to capture pilgrims with armored vehicles and armed escorts. Among the pilgrims is Beatrice, one of the women Gage saved from Chavo earlier. She warns the woman to be quiet and patient. While Jackson and his men celebrate, Gage urges Melena, Jackson's girlfriend, to leave Defiance that night, revealing her identity as a bounty hunter.
She apprehends Jackson, but is captured immediately, having been betrayed by Melena, and also identified by Womack, who was now terminally infected by black lung. They briefly torture Gage, then Womack drives her out into the wilderness, and dumps her in a gorge. She survives the fall, and manages to get back to New Montana, but contracted a severe case of black lung. Doc revives her and tends her wounds, and together, the two plot to take down Jackson and the entire town of Defiance. They liberate Beatrice and the other captives from the silver mine, then engage the entire town. Gage severely wounds Lear, and is saved from a sniper by a repentant Melena. Gage pursues Jackson to the mines and fights with him, leaving him to die in an explosion using dynamite.
She returns to the town, where a wounded Doc had managed to dispatch Lear for good, cuts down the corpses hanging in the town entrance, and transports Doc back to New Montana by stretcher.
Release.
The film was released in Canada and the United States on February 2, 2018.
Reception.
Reviewer Michael Rechtshaffen of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that a "decent premise — and a game Gina Carano — get left in the dust kicked up by [...] a dull, draggy post-apocalyptic western" and that "all the potential fun has been sucked out of the movie" in his negative review of the film. Reviewer Joe Lydon of "Variety.com" noted numerous echoes of "Mad Max" and "A Fistful of Dollars" and ultimately described it as a "VOD-ready B-movie" in his review.

Aidon

Aidon Oy is a Finnish technology company that focuses on energy metering systems. Its product portfolio covers remote energy metering systems and smart grid applications which the company sells mainly to Nordic distribution system operators. The company's homebase and headquarters is in Jyväskylä and it has offices also in Vantaa in Finland, Solna in Sweden and Asker in Norway as well as a logistics center in Vantaa.   
History.
Seven electrical engineers founded Aidon in Jyväskylä in 2004. They had got to know each other while working at a Jyväskylä based meter manufacturer Enermet (nowadays Landis+Gyr). Remotely read meters were becoming more common and the founders anticipated that the energy infrastructure would undergo a major change. They prepared a 30-page plan with help of which their new startup got funding of 4.8 million euros.
The company started their product development by visiting electricity distribution companies and asking about their needs involving energy metering. The first remotely read electricity meters had came to market already in the 1990s. They were traditional meters which reading was transformed to digital. Aidon was the first company who integrated functionalities for electricity grid management into a meter which was changing the market.
At first the founders’ former colleagues were hired to the company. At the end of the decade, when Nokia closed down its office in Jyväskylä, new competent resources were gained from there. ”Then we had a stroke of luck. Someone invented smart grid and it ignited buzz”, CEO Timo Chrons described the company's next steps later on. The leading position in the Nordics was achieved because the Finnish customers had been suitably demanding which helped the company to boost its competitiveness.
In year 2010 Aidon employed 30-40 people.
In 2013 a Swedish investor Alder joined as an owner.
In 2015 the company's turn-over was 20 million euros. By the beginning of 2016 Aidon had made contracts for more than 2.5 million metering points in the Nordic countries. Between 2014 and 2017 the company's turn-over grew almost tenfold (90 million euros in 2017).
In May 2019 Aidon acquired Mitello business from Polarmit Oy. Mitello focuses on metering operations and grid maintenance support.
Customers.
By spring 2018 the company had delivered 2.6 million energy metering devices to Nordic countries. The company is market leader in Finland and in Norway. An EU directive requires the energy meters to be remotely read and different EU countries are applying the requirement at their own pace, with Swedish and Finnish Distribution System Operators among the first ones. In many other countries the change is just in the beginning: according to Aidon, hundreds of millions of energy meters will be changed within the coming years. In 2017 more than two thirds of the company's turn-over came from Norway.
Products.
Aidon was the first company in the world to equip energy meters with sensors to detect events in the electricity grid. Its energy meters are called energy service devices. They can be remotely updated and various applications can be downloaded to them. The devices are integrated with Distribution System Operators’ information systems to register information for example about faults and load in low-voltage network. Aidon also helps to analyse the data collected from the electricity grid. With help of the products the operators can now for the first time see if their customers are getting electricity or not.
The electronics of Aidon devices are manufactured in China, Latvia and Lithuania. Their software is developed in Jyväskylä and the customisation for different customers is done in Vantaa.

Constantin Rădulescu (footballer, born 1924)

Constantin "Jumate" Rădulescu (30 May 1924 – 2001), commonly known as Dr. Constantin Rădulescu, was a Romanian doctor, footballer and manager. As a footballer he played mainly as a midfielder.
In 2005, as a tribute to the work done in building and rising the club, CFR Cluj renamed its stadium as Stadionul Dr. Constantin Rădulescu.
Club career.
Early years of football (Olympia and Sportul).
Born in Bucharest, Rădulescu started his career at Olympia București then moved to Sportul Studențesc in 1942, for which he played in 8 matches in the Divizia A.
Universitatea Cluj.
In 1943 the doctor signed with Universitatea Cluj, team that played at Sibiu in that period as a consequence of the territorial agreement known as the Second Vienna Award, by which Northern Transylvania became part of the Kingdom of Hungary as a result of World War II events. That team would be known as a symbol of the Romanian resistance in Transylvania. In 1949 he left "U" as a result of some misunderstandings and would declare later in his book, "O viaţă închinată fotbalului" (A life dedicated to football): "Honestly, I split hard and regretfully from this wonderful team, which deserves any superlatives."
CFR Cluj.
After leaving "U", Constantin Rădulescu chose to continue his career at the rival CFR, known at the time as "Locomotiva", a small team that still did not seem to become the Universitatea's bitter rival. For CFR he played 6 years and retired in 1956, at only 31 years old due to a serious injury.
Manager career.
Early years.
After retirement the doctor started immediately his football manager career at CFR and after some seasons in the Divizia B and Divizia C he signed with his first love, Universitatea Cluj, known at that time as "Știința", but only resisting one season in this position.
The Creator of CFR Cluj.
In the summer of 1963 he went back to CFR Cluj, known at that time as "CSM Cluj", and would begin the building of the team that later would become the bitter rival of Universitatea. In 1969 he succeeded the first Divizia A promotion in the history of CFR, managing to maintain the team on the first stage of the Romanian football until 1976 and at the end of 1972–73 season, a 5th place, the best ranking in history of the club until 2006. These performances are all the more incredible as the team has inadequate training, organizational and financial conditions, Rădulescu was telling in his book: "No finances and players, no headquarters, secretary or organizer. So we started in the first league in 1969."
After relegation he moved back to "U" for one season, then reaching lower league teams such as CUG Cluj or Sticla Arieșul Turda.
In 1992 at 68 years old the doctor returned to his creation, CFR, and managed the team for 3 years in Liga III, helping at the creation of the team that would promote a year later.
Playing and Managing style.
As a player, Rădulescu turned throw-ins into real corner kicks.
As a manager he is considered a real Alex Ferguson of CFR Cluj by former player Marius Bretan and former player Romică Petrescu said: "Ajax and CFR used the same training methods. The training cycle was taken from Ajax, with two training sessions on Tuesday, two on Thursday, free on Wednesday. Everything was done counter-clockwise, after pulse, after tension."
Augustin Ţegean, a CFR legend described him: "A distinct character from all points of view: tough, severe, does not give up his principles. He always told us that he was only allowed to make fun because he was from Bucharest. He was a strong personality, we all respected him. We were afraid of him. [..] I can say he was using new methods for those times. He explained the game schemes on the board. The marks were made man-to-man. Everyone knew exactly what area to cover on the pitch. His methods were the most modern."
Trivia.
"He refused the national team so that he would not lose his doctor's position", told the doctor's daughter, Ioana Stanca Gidro. In 1972, the Minister of Transport asked him to take over Rapid București, but he refused again, this time using a tertip, demanding that Rică Răducanu, a legend of Rapid, to be kicked out.
Personal life.
Rădulescu's daughter, Stanca Ioana Gidro is a lawyer and former dean of the Cluj-Napoca Bar, among other.

Morten Kringelbach

Morten L Kringelbach is a professor of neuroscience at Aarhus University, Denmark and University of Oxford, UK, where his 
Hedonia Research Group is based. He is a fellow of The Queen's College, Oxford and a board member of the Empathy Museum.
Research overview.
Kringelbach has made contributions to a range of topics within neuroscience using neuroimaging, deep brain stimulation and whole-brain modelling. His research is focused on reverse-engineering the human brain and in particular he has 
identified some of the evolutionary principles and heuristics of "teleological computation" enabling us to survive and thrive, which 
depend on intact human brain systems related to emotion, pleasure and eudaimonia. Together with Kent Berridge he has 
identified brain mechanisms underlying the reward system and identified a network of hedonic hotspots essential for the fundamental "pleasure cycle" of 'wanting', 'liking' and learning. In a large series of neuroimaging studies of many rewards, he has elucidated the spatiotemporal organisation of the orbitofrontal cortex, e.g. demonstrating a fast parental signature of infant cuteness even in adults who are not yet parents. 
They have also investigated the close links between pleasure and happiness 
Kringelbach has also worked with neurosurgeon Tipu Aziz to elucidate the neural mechanisms of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, dystonia and chronic pain
Furthermore, Kringelbach and Gustavo Deco have developed a research programme of whole-brain modelling for combining structural connectivity data Diffusion Tensor Imaging with functional neuroimaging data such as fMRI and magnetoencephalography. This allows for the discovery of causal mechanisms of brain function, and they have e.g. identified fundamental mechanisms and principles of integration and segregation, as well as metastability and coherence. In time, these findings might help open up for a better understanding and potential treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders as well as the role of one of the cardinal symptoms, namely anhedonia, the lack of pleasure

Book Row

Book Row was a district in New York City from the 1890s to the 1960s composed of six city blocks which, at its peak, contained over three dozen bookstores. Many – if not most – of the places were used bookstores. In its heyday, Book Row spanned the stretch of Fourth Avenue between Union Square and Astor Place. Other names for it included "Booksellers' Row" and "Second-Hand Row."
By the 1960s, skyrocketing rents had forced most of the bookstores to move or close. Apartments replaced most of the former storefronts. Another factor contributing to Book Row's decline was the retirements and/or deaths of the stores' original owners. By 1984, just two stores remained on Fourth Avenue. The only bookstore from Book Row that survives today is the Strand Bookstore, which moved away in 1957 due to major rent increases.

Summary.
For the first time ever in a World Championship, every runner in a single preliminary heat was disqualified. It was the third heat, where first returning silver medalist Abdalelah Haroun false started himself out of the heat. #5 runner of all time Bralon Taplin won the heat, but he and the other three remaining runners Austris Karpinskis, Alonzo Russell and Steven Gayle were then disqualified for lane violations. 
2012 Champion Nery Brenes also found himself disqualified after winning the fifth heat. With two place qualifiers missing, it opened the door for Juander Santos and Mikhail Litvin to take the extra time qualification positions in the semi-final round.
In the final, Óscar Husillos from lane 6 was first to the break line and took the lead with a lap to go, holding the lead to cross the finish line first in a time of 44.92. However, Husillos and Luguelin Santos were disqualified for lane violations, giving Pavel Maslák his third consecutive championship, Michael Cherry the silver, and Deon Lendore the bronze.

Llanstinan

Llanstinan is a rural parish in the community of Scleddau, north Pembrokeshire, Wales, south of Fishguard.
History.
Parish.
Originally in the ancient Hundred of Dewisland, formerly a pre-Norman cantref, the parish is bordered in the west by the Western Cleddau river and in the east by Nant y Bugail; it is entirely rural. Decayed but distinct prehistoric earthworks exist. A 1578 map in the British Library shows the parish as "Llannastynan". A village named Llanstinan does not appear to have ever existed; the nearby villages of Trecwn in the east and Scleddau in the west have gained more prominence. The population in 1801 was 114. Lewis's "Topographical Dictionary" of 1833 gives the population as 168. The 1849 edition expands the population to 170, and notes that there is a small slate quarry in the parish and a Calvinist Methodist place of worship. By the 1870s the population was 174, in 36 houses.
The parish is now part of the Benefice of Llanwnda (St Gwyndaf) and Goodwick (St Peter) with Manorowen and Llanstinan in the Diocese of St David's.
Parish church.
The parish church of St Justinian, isolated in farmland, is mediaeval or Norman in origin, but was substantially rebuilt in the 19th century. It is a Grade II* listed building.
Notable people.
Sir William Wogan (politician) was a member of the influential Wogan family of Llanstinan who died in 1710, leaving his estate to a Symmons relative. The Reverend Dr Charles Symmons (17491826) was a grandson of John Symmons (1701–64) of Llanstinan. The Symmons family was a significant one in the area, and beyond. Their seat was Llanstinan House, which was acquired by a member of another significant local family, Sir Hugh Owen (1803–91), in the 19th century. The Royal Commission in about 2003 published a paper on the status and history of the house, whose origins are thought to date back to the 16th century, and since then has seen luxurious times to more recent decay. Richard Fenton in 1811 referred to Llanstinan as "...a place I shall ever remember, with an affection that I want words to express..."

WASP-31b

WASP-31b is a low-density (puffy) "hot Jupiter" extrasolar planet orbiting the metal-poor (63% of solar metallicity) dwarf star WASP-31. The exoplanet was discovered in 2010 by the WASP project. WASP-31b is in the constellation of Crater, and is about 1305 light-years (light travel distance) from Earth.
Characteristics.
WASP-31b is a low-density (puffy) "hot Jupiter" exoplanet with a mass about 0.48 times that of Jupiter and a radius about 1.55 times that of Jupiter. The planetary atmosphere has indeed the largest scale height, equal to 1150km, among exoplanets with measurable atmospheres as at 2021.
The exoplanet orbits WASP-31, its host star, every 3.4 days. 
In 2012, it was found from the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect that WASP-31b is orbiting the parent star in a prograde direction, with the WASP-31 star rotational axis inclined to the planetary orbit by 2.8 degrees. The spectroscopic study in 2014 revealed that WASP-31b has a dense cloud deck overlaid by a hazy atmosphere. WASP-31b was also reported to have significant amounts of potassium in its upper atmosphere, but the detection of potassium was refuted in 2015. The potassium detection discrepancy was resolved in 2020 with the improved cloud deck model, with the best fit being a very small amount of water over clouds and no potassium at all.
Reanalysis of planetary spectroscopic data in 2020 has revealed the presence of chromium monohydride besides water.

Newspaper Row was a district of Washington D.C., on the corner of 14th Street Northwest and Pennsylvania Avenue. Historian Paul Dickinson said the area “was sort of the center of the nation’s news gathering.” The area got its start when Western Union opened a telegraph station in the 1850s. Many newspapers, including "The New York Times", "New York World", "The Boston Advertiser, The New York Tribune, The Baltimore Sun" and "The Washington Post" had offices, or were based there. The National Press Building was built in the district in 1926, to consolidate the departments of the newspapers into one building. When the National Press Building moved, most of the newspapers left the district as well.

The Faith of Donald J. Trump: A Spiritual Biography is a 2018 non-fiction book co-authored by David Brody and Scott Lamb about the religious faith of U.S. President Donald Trump. Shortly after its release, President Trump tweeted that it was a "very interesting read."
Reviewing it for "The Weekly Standard", Erick Erickson noted, "the authors suggest that Trump’s rapacious libido is just his misguided quest for God." He added that they downplay Norman Vincent Peale's influence on President Trump, and concluded that the relationship between evangelical leaders and President Trump is "utterly transactional."
Reception.
The book was heavily criticized, and treated as a joke by many newspapers and organizations.

Diolite

Diolite (1927 – 1951) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was arguably the best British two-year-old of 1929, when he won three of his five races including the Coventry Stakes and the Molecomb Stakes. In the following year he won the 2000 Guineas and finished third when favourite for the Epsom Derby. He remained in training for another two years but won only one more race. After his retirement from racing he became a very successful breeding stallion in Japan.
Background.
Diolite was a "well made" bay horse "of medium size, with a good action" bred by C W Birkin. As a yearling in October 1928 he was offered for sale at Doncaster and bought for 480 guineas by Hugo Hirst. The colt was sent into training with Fred Templeman at Lambourn in Berkshire.
Diolite was probably the best horse sired by Diophon, who won the 2000 Guineas in 1924. Diolite's dam Needle Rock also produced Lady Kroon, the female-line ancestor of Lavandin.
Racing career.
1929: two-year-old season.
Until 1946 two-year-old racehorses in Britain did not have to be officially named and the colt who was to become "Diolite" was unnamed on his racecourse debut in April 1929 when he finished third to the Aga Khan's Blenheim in the Manton Plate at Newmarket Racecourse. After then finishing second at Goodwood Racecourse he recorded his first success in the Spring Stakes at Newmarket in May. At Royal Ascot in June he started at odds of 7/1 in the Coventry Stakes and won from Lovat Scout. In the following month at Goodwood Racecourse he took the Molecomb Stakes, beating the fillies Qurrat-Al Ain and Grace Dalrymple at odds of 3/1.
In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the season's best juveniles Diolite received a weight of 129 pounds making him the best British two-year-old of 1929 ahead of Press Gang (128), Challenger (127) and Blenheim (126).
1930: three-year-old season.
On 7 May 1930, Diolite, ridden by Freddie Fox, started at odds of 10/1 in a 28-runner field for the 122nd running 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. The race was attended by the King and attracted enormous betting interest, with a record £9,308 being wagered on The Tote. Fox restrained the colt just behind the leaders before allowing Diolite to sprint clear inside the final furlong and win "easily" by two lengths from Paradine, with Silver Flare a length away in third place. After the race Hugo Hirst commented "I always fancied the chance Diolite and I was justified. I think he will win the Derby".
In the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 4 June Diolite started 11/4 favourite against sixteen opponents, despite doubts about his ability to stay the distance. He was among the leaders for most of the way and took the lead early in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and finished third behind Blenheim and Illiad, beaten three lengths by the winner. There were some suggestions that Diolite's jockey C. Day was at fault for going too quickly in the early stages instead of holding the colt up for a late run. At Royal Ascot later in June Diolite was dropped back to sprint distances for the five furlong Fern Hill Stakes and finished third behind Stingo.
Diolite returned for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse but appeared to run short of stamina as he came home seventh behind Singapore. A month later the colt finished unplaced behind Rutom Pasha in the Champion Stakes. In November Hirst decline a challenge to send Diolite to Australia for a match race against Phar Lap, suggesting instead that the Australian champion should be sent to England.
Later career.
Diolite remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover his best form and recorded his only victory in a handicap race at Liverpool. In April 1931 he finished unplaced in the Great Jubilee Handicap at Kempton Park Racecourse. In October he finished second to the three-year-old Portlaw in the Challenge Stakes at Newmarket, beaten three quarters of a length in a two-runner race. In April 1932 he was strongly fancied for the Lincoln Handicap but finished unplaced behind Jerome Fandor.
Assessment and honours.

Robert Bolick

Robert Lee E. Bolick Jr. (born September 13, 1995) is a Filipino professional basketball player for the NorthPort Batang Pier of Philippine Basketball Association (PBA). He played college basketball for the San Beda Red Lions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines). He plays both point guard and shooting guard positions.
High school career.
Bolick played for the La Salle Green Hills Greenies from 2011 to 2012. Bolick averaged a team-high 20.3 points for the Greenies, including a season-best 41 points against Perpetual Help in his last season. He also posted marks of 5.2 rebounds, 4.2 assists, 2.6 steals, and 1.2 blocks per outing during his last season for the Greenies.
College career.
De La Salle Green Archers.
Bolick started his collegiate career in the UAAP playing for the De La Salle Green Archers in 2013. During the off-season prior, the Green Archers continued its recruiting binge for the next UAAP season by obtaining the commitment of another blue-chip high school prospect in the likeness of Robert Bolick. Head coach Gee Abanilla confirmed he had already expressed his intention to suit up for the Green Archers, following in the footsteps of Bacolod sensation Kib Montalbo.
Transfer from La Salle to San Beda.
Prior to leaving the Green Archers in 2015, Bolick was a part of the La Salle squad that won the Season 76 UAAP championship, but his playing time dropped in Season 77, as he averaged 9.1 minutes per game, averaging 1.8 points per contest. He had several options after deciding to leave the Green Archers but eventually opted to move to the reigning NCAA champions San Beda Red Lions. Bolick practiced with University of the Philippines and Ateneo de Manila University, and said he felt welcomed in both squads. But in the end, he chose San Beda University (then San Beda College) because he could not pass up the opportunity to play for head coach Jamike Jarin.
Bolick underwent a one-year residency period and was eligible to play for San Beda in 2016, the year after former star point guard Baser Amer graduated.
San Beda Red Lions.
Bolick finally joined the Red Lions' lineup in 2016. He emerged as the unlikely face of the multi-titled San Beda team, beginning in the playoffs last season when he took over in the semifinals against University of Perpetual Help, before standing toe to toe with the prolific Jiovani Jalalon and Arellano in the finals. He helped the Red Lions gain their first title since 2014, and their sixth championship in seven years, earning himself the nickname "Beastmode Bolick". He was named the collegiate Impact Player of the Year at the 2017 Collegiate Basketball Awards.
He started out his second season in San Beda averaging 13.7 points per outing before their game against the College of St. Benilde Blazers in which he, along with two other players were disqualified after a scuffle. The disqualification was especially costly for Bolick, who was in the running for MVP and Mythical Team honors. As per NCAA rules, a player who is ejected from a game is automatically disqualified from individual awards. All three players were also automatically suspended for their next games. In an interview with ABS-CBN, head coach Boyet Fernandez stated, "Bakit naman ito-throw out mo 'yung tao? Diyos ko naman. The guy was running for MVP. He destroyed the future of that guy." He exited the game with 14 points, 11 assists, and seven rebounds.
Having both their two losses in the elimination round coming from the Lyceum Pirates, who just came off their historic 18-0 elimination sweep, the odds were against them in the finals. However, Bolick was the difference maker for San Beda by heavily contributing to their finals sweep. In their first game, he finished with 18 points, 7 in the fourth-quarter fightback where his passing also keyed two critical baskets that led to the Red Lions' hot finish. After drilling the 3-pointer that gave San Beda an 89-82 lead with 50 seconds remaining, adrenaline took over Bolick, who celebrated the shot with the so-called "reverse raise-the-roof" gesture popularized by LeBron James.
He was similarly stoked late in Game 1, when he kept making plays and no defender was able to contain him. In game 2, he had 24 points, 11 of which came in the fourth quarter. He finished the job started by Donald Tankoua, who kept San Beda in the game for the first three periods and had 27 points and 20 boards, bagging the Red Lions their 21st title and their 3rd back-to-back championship in 12 years.
Amateur career.
Bolick continued his rise by winning the PBA D-League Aspirant's Cup MVP award with the Cignal HD-San Beda Hawkeyes, defeating Racal Ceramica in three games winning the 2017 PBA D-League Aspirant's Cup Championship.
Professional career.
Bolick was picked third overall by the NorthPort Batang Pier of the Philippine Basketball Association in the 2018 PBA draft. Bolick signed a two-year max contract with NorthPort just a couple of days after being selected as the third overall pick by the Batang Pier in the 2018 PBA Rookie Draft.
In his first game, he scored 10 points in his first six minutes in the PBA, had nine in the third quarter before adding the finishing touches in the final frame including a tough step back jumper from the deep right corner in front of his team’s bench. He debuted with a game-high 26 points on 10-of-12 shooting from the field on top of three rebounds and three assists in close to 36 minutes of play, setting a franchise record for most points scored by a rookie in a debut.
With teammates Stanley Pringle and Sean Anthony out due to injuries, he became the Batang Pier's first option and was named as the Player of the Week and the unanimous Rookie of the Month for June 2019.

Constantine (son of Basil I)

Constantine (–3 September 879) was a junior Byzantine emperor from January 868 to 3 September 879. His parentage is a matter of debate, but he is generally assumed to be the son of Byzantine Emperor Basil I ( 867–886) and his first wife, Maria or second wife Eudokia Ingerina; although other theories include him being the son of Emperor Michael III ( 842–867) and Eudokia. Constantine was made co-emperor by his father in January 868. He was the intended heir of Basil, and as such received much attention from him, and accompanied him on military campaigns. He died on 3 September 879, before his father. After his death, his younger brother Leo VI ( 886–912), became the primary heir, and another brother Alexander ( 912–913) was raised to co-emperor.
Life.
Parentage.
Constantine was born at an unconfirmed date: Historian Nicholas Adontz argues that he was born 855, whereas Shaun Tougher states that he may have been born in 864 or after. There is a severe argument about the parentage of Constantine, as Byzantine Emperor Basil I ( 867–886), generally accepted as his father, had two wives, Maria and Eudokia Ingerina ( 866–882), according to some sources in the tradition of Symeon Logothete. These sources state that Basil had been married to Maria, a Macedonian, before he became emperor, and produced at least one child, Anastasia, and possibly Constantine himself, before being ordered by ruling Emperor Michael III ( 842–867) to divorce her and marry Eudokia, which he did; the exact date is unknown, but the marriage of Basil to Eudokia has been traditionally dated to 865, based upon the timeline of Pseudo-Symeon; although historians such as Romilly Jenkins and Patricia Karlin-Hayter have questioned the validity of this timeline. Jenkins also points to the "chronological incongruities" of Symeon Logothete's narrative of Michael's reign, casting further doubt on the marriage date of Basil and Eudokia. Historian Cyril Mango states his belief that Constantine was the child of Basil and Maria, along with Anastasia, a view shared by George Ostrogorsky. Judith Herrin, however, argues a different date for the marriage of Basil and Eudokia, which would make Eudokia the mother of Constantine. Leo Grammaticus, on the other hand, suggests that Constantine was the son of Michael and Eudokia. Lynda Garland and Shaun Tougher do not take a position in their 2007 work but admit either of the three are possible while leaning toward Basil as the father. 
Some sources hostile to the Macedonian Dynasty, including Symeon Logothete, have suggested that future Emperor Leo VI ( 886–912), nominally the son of Basil and Eudokia, was actually the son of Michael and that she was Michael's mistress for much of his life, based on the time of his birth relative to her marriage to Basil. It is possible that this marriage was intended to be purely nominal, and that Michael offered his oldest sister, Thekla, to Basil as a mistress during this time, and some sources suggest that Eudokia herself remained as Michael's mistress. Symeon Logothete implies that not only Leo, but also Stephen, was the son of Michael. George Hamartolos, a contemporary source, argues that the future Emperor Alexander ( 912–913), was legitimately Basil's son. Mango suggests the intention of the marriage was to ensure Leo, whom Eudokia was then pregnant with, per some sources, would be born in the purple, officially as the child of a co-emperor and empress, rather than an emperor and a mistress. Garland and Tougher admit that pro-Macedonian sources would be unlikely to admit to such infidelity, as it would embarrass the dynasty. However, they doubt the entire narrative of Symeon Logothete, as he is generally hostile to the Macedonian dynasty, and question how, if Eudokia had been Michael's mistress since he was young, Leo could be their first child. Both Ostrogorsky and Adontz hold that Leo was the legitimate son of Basil and Eudokia, and dismiss the conspiracy. Karlin-Hayter in her investigation of the rumors of infidelity notes that it is only contained within anti-Macedonian sources and that the rumor was contemporary to Michael's reign, and concludes the rumor was intended to humiliate Basil. Arnold J. Toynbee argues that parents may have different feelings for sons, and the difference of personality is as likely as different mothers to explain why Basil preferred Constantine to Leo.
Tougher in his 1994 Ph.D. thesis supports the theory that Constantine is the son of Basil and Eudokia. In his later 1997 work, he argues against much of the reasoning behind considering Constantine to be Maria's son but does not definitively state a mother for Constantine. In his 1994 work, he points out that many Byzantine chroniclers consider Constantine to be the son of Basil, and that many historians use an argument that Constantine is Maria's son as a tool to explain why, Leo, but not Constantine, is said to be hated by Basil, as Basil would therefore consider Constantine his true son. He also argues that Alexander, who could not possibly be Michael's son by virtue of being born after his death, was not elevated in place of Constantine and Leo, suggesting either Basil believed them both to be his own sons, or else was not bothered by them not being such, and that Michael does not seem to have viewed Leo in any paternal way, stating that "this in itself is telling". Tougher questions the arguments that preclude Constantine from being the son of Eudokia by way of arguing that he would therefore have been too young to campaign with his father in 878; he argues that, given the issues related to the chronology of the marriage of Basil and Eudokia, it is possible that Constantine would be of fighting age. 
In his 1997 work, Tougher points out that Mango's reconstruction is ingenious, but convoluted, arguing that Michael could simply have adopted Constantine, rather than enacting a conspiracy to have his child, who he could not have known would be male, born in the purple. further reinforced by the fact that Alexander was only made emperor in 879, after Constantine's death. Tougher also points out that Leo VI advocated bringing the son of noblemen, called "noble whelps", on campaigns in his "Tactica", the same term that the "Life of Basil" uses for Constantine in its narrative of the 878 campaign; therefore stating that it was possible Constantine may have been 13/14 at the time, and therefore the son of Eudokia. Adontz argues that Constantine must have been born around 855, and is, therefore, the son of Maria, in order to be engaged to Ermengard of Italy, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Louis II, however, Tougher argues that this engagement reflects that more of a child's engagement than a true marriage, and that, given that many Byzantine men were married at age 15, this may point to him being younger. 
Later life.
Basil had risen to co-emperor by convincing Michael that his uncle Bardas was plotting against him and after slaying Bardas with Michael's blessing, was crowned on 26 May 866. However, tensions between Basil and Michael built up, and Basil feared that he would be replaced, as Michael had threatened to make the patrician Basiliskianos emperor instead. Therefore, on 23/24 September 867, Basil and his conspirators murdered him in his bed, making Basil the sole emperor.
Constantine, along with the rest of his brothers, was educated by Photios, later the Patriarch of Constantinople; Photios may also have been the godfather of Constantine, although some sources, such as Tougher, believe Photios was the godfather of Leo, rather than Constantine. Constantine is thought to have received more direct education and attention from Basil, whereas his other brothers may have been accompanied by court eunuchs. Constantine was made co-emperor by Basil in January 868, and was his intended heir. Although Leo was raised to on 6 January 870, Tougher views it likely that although Leo technically shared in imperial status, he was intended to live a life of obscurity, existing only to secure the imperial succession, much as Alexander later would under Leo himself.
Constantine was engaged to Ermengard of Italy, the daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Louis II, in 870/871, Charles Previté-Orton and Werner Ohnsorge take the position that they married, however, Tougher (1994) argues that there is no evidence he ever married. Constantine served in military campaigns alongside his father, in order to prepare him to be a military leader, including a campaign in Syria, for which he shared a triumph in Constantinople with his father in 878. In January 879, Constantine and his father campaigned in Germanicia, to great success. That summer, they returned and plundered Germanicia and Adata, and raided northern Mesopotamia.
Death.
Constantine died unexpectedly of fever on 3 September 879, leaving Leo as heir.Basil was severely effected by Constantine's death, and declared a period of mourning after this, possibly lasting up to six months. Notably, much of the coinage made after his death focuses upon him. Romilly Jenkins states that after Constantine's death "Basil went out of mind, and continued during the next seven years to be subject to fits of derangement," and relates that Basil became violent and contemptuous toward Leo, whom he "had never cared for", despising his "bookish youth"; However, Tougher considers this "at best, an overstatement." Tougher does concede that pro-Macedonian sources have an obvious bias in declaring that Basil recovered "manfully, inspired by the example of Job", but believes Basil's shock was due more to the loss of an heir which Basil had trained well, and expected to succeed him, rather than true favoritism. Basil also had Constantine declared a saint by Photios I, the Patriarch of Constantinople, confirmed by the Synaxarion of Constantinople. The "Life of Ignatios" states that Basil had numerous churches and monasteries built in honor of Constantine, including one at a location where Theodore Santabarenos was supposedly able to summon the ghost of Constantine for Basil.
After the death of Constantine, Basil focused upon securing his dynasty by marrying Leo to Theophano Martinakia, in order for them to produce heirs, and Tougher (1994) remarks that Basil may even have become overprotective, shielding his remaining children from warfare. Additionally, Alexander is believed to have been crowned emperor following Constantine's death, in 879. Leo was imprisoned and stripped of imperial rank by Basil in 883, allegedly for his plans to usurp him, whereafter Alexander appears to have become the heir, until July 886, when Leo was released and restored as emperor. Just a month later, on 29 August 886, Basil died of wounds from a hunting trip, and Leo succeeded him.
Historiography.
Pro-Macedonian sources usually exclude information regarding Basil's first marriage to Maria; for instance, Leo VI, Constantine VII, and Joseph Genesius do not mention Maria's existence. Constantine VII states that all of his aunts and uncles were the legitimate children of Basil and Eudokia, while Leo goes further in stating that Basil and Eudokia produced children before being married to each other. Constantine VII gives an idealized version of Basil's reign, such as when he states that when Basil was coronated at the Hagia Sophia, he was followed by a chariot containing Eudokia, as well as Constantine in Leo, and that both Constantine and Leo were coronated at the same time as Basil, in 867, which no other source agrees with. The , by way of omitting anything to the contrary, implies that the marriage of Basil and Eudokia was regular, rather than the conspiracy expounded by Symeon Logothete. 
Anti-Macedonian sources, such as the 10th-century Symeon Logothete, usually assume Constantine is the son of Eudokia, these sources provide information regarding the alleged infidelity of Eudokia, and the arrangement between Michael and Basil. 
Constantine is mentioned in The Acts of the Eighth Ecumenical Council, which records him as emperor. There are numerous coins where he appears alongside Basil and other members of his family, where he often bears the title .

Flags and Waves

Flags and Waves is a short computer animation test clip which was created by animator Bill Reeves and Alain Fournier for Pixar sometime in 1986. The clip included waves reflecting a sunset and lapping against the shore. Reeves and Fournier made the project with the feedback of John Lasseter to work out details of rendering water and waves realistically, including lighting, motion, and shading. 
It was exhibited at SIGGRAPH in Dallas in August 1986, along with Lasseter’s landmark computer animated short "Luxo Jr." and another test project "Beach Chair", by Eben Ostby. The methods developed during the creation of this project were the basis of the water in "Finding Nemo". It is based on an oceanographic model of ocean waves which Fournier dug out of the literature from the nineteenth century.
"Flags and Waves" can also be found as an easter egg in the "Pixar Short Films Collection – Volume 1" which was released in November 2007.
Content.
The fourteen second short begins with the title "Flags and Waves", and under it the title in French: "Drapeaux et Vagues" superimposed on the SMPTE color bars while a high pitch frequency sound is made. The bars are revealed to be a flag which is flapping in the wind, as the noise shifts to the sound of a calm beach side. The camera pans up to show three more flags flapping in front of a beach as the bright sun appears to be setting.

Crib lighthouse

A Crib lighthouse is a type of lighthouse whose structure rests on a concrete or masonry foundation supported with wooden beams. The name "crib" refers to the wooden crib pier style of construction which was used as a foundation for lighthouses. When it came time to build, wooden cribs were constructed onshore then towed to the site where they were filled with stone so they sank in place. The crib was then leveled and capped with concrete or masonry on which the lighthouse structure was constructed. Crib lighthouses were built extensively in the Great Lakes region, as the hardrock bottoms of these water bodies provided ideal foundations. Problems arose however if the crib settled unevenly into the earth as was the case with the Detroit River Light.
The Spectacle Reef Light is an example of this type of structure.

Byzantine Empire under the Amorian dynasty

The Byzantine Empire was ruled by the Amorian or Phrygian dynasty from 820 to 867. The Amorian dynasty continued the policy of restored iconoclasm (the "Second Iconoclasm") started by the previous non-dynastic emperor Leo V in 813, until its abolition by Empress Theodora with the help of Patriarch Methodios in 842. The continued iconoclasm further worsened relations between the East and the West, which were already bad following the papal coronations of a rival line of "Roman Emperors" beginning with Charlemagne in 800. Relations worsened even further during the so-called Photian Schism, when Pope Nicholas I challenged Photios' elevation to the patriarchate. However, the era also saw a revival in intellectual activity which was marked by the end of iconoclasm under Michael III, which contributed to the upcoming Macedonian Renaissance. 
During the Second Iconoclasm, the Empire began to see systems resembling feudalism being put in place, with large and local landholders becoming increasingly prominent, receiving lands in return for military service to the central government. Similar systems had been in place in the Roman Empire ever since the reign of Severus Alexander during the third century, when Roman soldiers and their heirs were granted lands on the condition of service to the Emperor. 
Michael II.
Michael was originally a high-ranking soldier serving under Emperor Michael I Rangabe of the Nikephorian dynasty. He aided Leo V in his overthrow of Michael I, but, as relations worsened between Leo and Michael, Leo eventually sentenced Michael to death. In response, Michael led a conspiracy that resulted in the assassination of Leo on Christmas 820. Taking the throne for himself, Michael II was immediately faced with a revolt by Thomas the Slav, which became a civil war that lasted four years and almost cost Michael the throne. Michael continued the practice of iconoclasm, which had been reinvigorated by Leo V.
The reign of Michael II saw two major military disasters that would have permanent effects on the Empire: the beginning of the Muslim conquest of Sicily, and the loss of Crete to the Saracens.
Michael was not popular among the Orthodox clergy, but he would prove himself a competent statesman and administrator, eventually bringing much-needed stability to the Empire following decades of strife and warfare and even restorations of the military. He was succeeded by his only son, Theophilos, upon his death in 829.
Theophilos.
Theophilos succeeded Michael II in 829 and was the last Byzantine Emperor to support iconoclasm. Theophilos waged war against the Arabs throughout the entirety of his reign, being forced to war on two fronts as Sicily had been taken and Arab armies continued to march from the East as well. The defence after the invasion of Anatolia by the Abbasid Caliph Al-Ma'mun in 830 was led by the Emperor himself, but the Byzantines were defeated and lost several fortresses. In 831 Theophilos retaliated by leading a large army into Cilicia and capturing Tarsus. The Emperor returned to Constantinople in triumph, but in the autumn he was defeated in Cappadocia. Another defeat in the same province in 833 forced Theophilos to sue for peace, which he obtained the next year, after the death of Al-Ma'mun.
War continued, and Theophilos personally led armies into Mesopotamia in 837, capturing Melitene and Arsamosata with a massive army numbering 70,000. Further battles and attacks would take place until Theophilos died of disease in 842. He was succeeded by his son Michael III.
Michael III.
Michael III would play a vital role in the Byzantine resurgence of the 9th century. As Michael was merely two years old when his father died, the Empire was governed by a regency headed by his mother Theodora, her uncle Sergios, and the minister Theoktistos. The empress had iconodule sympathies and deposed Patriarch John VII of Constantinople, replacing him with the iconodule Patriarch Methodius I of Constantinople in 843. This put an end to the second spell of iconoclasm. Michael and his supporters overthrew this regency in 857, becoming Emperor proper.
His reign would see continued war against the Arabs and due to his pleasure-loving nature he was nicknamed "the Drunkard" by later chroniclers positive to his murderer and successor Basil I.

Calamba–Pagsanjan Road

The Calamba–Pagsanjan Road, also known as Calamba–Sta. Cruz–Famy Junction Road and National Highway, is a two-to-four lane primary highway located in the province of Laguna in the Philippines.
The entire road is designated as the National Route 66 (N66), a national primary route of the Philippine highway network.
Route description.
It starts from the intersection of the Old National Highway (Manila South Road) and J.P. Rizal Street at the Calamba Crossing in Calamba. It will then follow a route that circumscribes the Laguna de Bay, passing through the municipalities of Los Baños, Bay, Calauan, Victoria, Pila, Santa Cruz, the capital of Laguna, and terminates in Pagsanjan, all in Laguna.
Alternative names.
The highway is also known as National Highway for being such. It forms part of the Calamba to Pagsanjan segment of the Calamba–Sta. Cruz–Famy Junction Road. Its section in Calauan and Victoria is also known as Masapang Highway (misspelled or also known as Maspang Highway), apparently after the barangay of the same name in Victoria where its eastern end is located. At the town proper of Pagsanjan, it is locally known as J.P. Rizal Street.
History.
Most of the highway existed back to the American colonial era as part of Highway 21 that linked the city of Manila to the provinces of Rizal and Laguna. Roads bypassing the "poblacion"s of Santa Cruz, Calauan, and Bay were later built to form the present-day highway.

Capitulation of Diksmuide

The Capitulation of Diksmuide, or Dixmuide, then in the Spanish Netherlands, took place from 26 to 28 July 1695, during the 1689 to 1697 Nine Years' War. An Allied garrison of around 4,000 men surrendered to a superior French force. 
After six years of war, both sides were financially exhausted; the focus of the 1695 campaign was the Allied siege of Namur, captured by the French in 1692. By attacking garrisons like Diksmuide, the French commander sought to prevent the Allies resupplying their army outside Namur. 
Its capitulation after only two days resulted in the court martial of garrison commander Major General Ellenberg, and other senior officers. While the reason for his surrender is still disputed, Ellenberg was executed and several officers dismissed.
Namur surrendered to the Allies in September; although fighting did not formally end until 1697, this was the last major event of the war. The French withdrew from Diksmuide following the Treaty of Ryswick. 
Background.
Under William's leadership, the Alliance held together through four years of war, with losses that were damaging, but not critical. By 1694, they held a numerical advantage in Flanders, and had recaptured towns like Huy and Diksmuide. However, both sides were also struggling with the huge economic and social costs of the war. 
The 1690s marked the lowest point of the so-called Little Ice Age, a period of cold and wet weather affecting Europe in the second half of the 17th century. Famine in France and Italy was mirrored elsewhere, including Spain and Scotland, where the harvest failed in 1695, 1696, 1698 and 1699 and an estimated 5-15% of the population starved to death. 
Most campaigns in this theatre took place in the Spanish Netherlands, a compact area 160 kilometres wide, its highest point only 100 metres above sea level, dominated by canals and rivers, the primary means of transport until the advent of railways in the 19th century. Namur's position at the intersection of the Sambre and Meuse rivers made it vital for defending the Netherlands against French invasion, and its recapture the main Allied objective for 1695. 
In April 1695, Louis ordered Boufflers to build entrenchments between the Scheldt and Lys, from Coutrai or Kortrijk to Avelgem. William marched on these in June, with the bulk of the Allied forces, but secretly detached Frederick of Prussia to Namur. Once Frederick was in place on 2 July, William joined him; the Allies were now split into a besieging force of 58,000 at Namur and a field army of 102,000 under Prince Vaudémont to cover Villeroi.
To support Vaudémont and secure supply lines for the besiegers, it was vital to hold as many crossing points as possible. One of the most important was Diksmuide, positioned on the Lys; while little more than a large village, even nearby Deinze controlled a bridge across the Lys, making it of far greater strategic significance than its size indicates.
Siege.
Vaudémont's task was to keep his army between Villeroy and Namur; Villeroy tried to tempt him out of position by attacking Allied-held towns like Knokke and Beselare, now Zonnebeke, but he refused to be drawn. It was accepted even places like Namur would fall given enough time, so the garrisons in Diksmuide and Deinze were expected to delay Villeroy for as long as possible.
Diksmuide sits on the Yser River, which begins in France, then runs through the town before entering the North Sea at Nieuwpoort. French defences followed the Yser via Ypres and Comines to Espierres and hardly changed between 1689-1694; its enduring strategic significance led to this line being fought over in both 1914 and 1940, while Diksmuide itself was attacked by the Germans in October 1914. 
The garrison commander at Diksmuide was Major-General Ellenberg, an experienced Dane who served William in Ireland and elsewhere. The town was taken by the Allies in 1694, and although the defences were in a poor state, it was held by a strong garrison of eight battalions of infantry plus several squadrons from Lloyd's Dragoons.
Vaudémont's covering army had been reduced by the need to bolster the assault forces at Namur; by stripping garrisons from Ypres and Menin, Villeroi achieved local superiority of 90,000 to 37,000. However, an attack on 14 July failed to break the Allied line; Vaudémont was able to conduct an orderly retreat, using the bridge across the Lys at Deinze.
Shortly after this, a force under the Comte de Montal appeared before Diksmuide; Ellenberg opened the sluice gates, while the Allied commander at Nieuwpoort broke the dykes, flooding the area around the town. This meant Diksmuide could only be assaulted from the east and while this was the weakest part of the defences, the position was considered 'serious but not desperate.'
Surrender.
On 26 July, Montal began firing on the town; after only two days, Ellenberg held a council with his senior officers, and proposed they surrender the town, arguing further resistance was pointless. Eight officers signed the articles of surrender, including Colonel Graham, commander of a regiment in the elite Scots Brigade; the only exception was Major Robert Duncanson of Lorne's. On 29 July, Colonel O'Farrell, commander of the garrison at Deinze, also capitulated to a French force under Feuquières without a shot being fired.
By now, siege warfare was an exact art, the rules of which were so well understood wagering on the outcome and duration of a siege became a popular craze; in 1691, the then enormous sum of £200,000 was alleged to have been bet on the outcome of the Siege of Limerick. Professional honour demanded a defence, but so long as they surrendered once 'a practicable breach' had been made, garrisons were given generous terms. Contemporaries felt Diksmuide should have been held for at least eight days; its rapid capitulation was extremely unusual, especially as Ellenberg opened negotiations with the besiegers.
The terms of surrender meant the garrison became prisoners, rather than being allowed to keep their weapons, and free passage to Allied lines. One suggestion is that Ellenberg was a capable and reliable subordinate who could not exercise command on his own. This seems unlikely for an experienced senior officer, since taking or holding fortifications was the dominant form of warfare in this period.
Graham and O'Farrell had served in the Scots Brigade since the 1670s and accompanied William to England in 1688; Deinze was held by O'Farrell's 'Fusiliers,' a designation reserved for elite units and fought at Walcourt, Steinkirk and Landen. While Deinze was simply a fortified village, William was furious neither of the garrisons had 'done their duty.' In his Diary entry for 8 December 1695, Constantijn Huygens, William's Secretary for Dutch affairs, suggests Ellenberg was bribed by the French.
Aftermath.
Desertion and ill-discipline among enlisted men were ongoing issues in this period, due to poor conditions and irregular payment of wages; a lapse of commitment among senior officers was a much more serious problem. Evidence presented at the court martial indicates both Ellenberg and O'Farrell simply took the wrong decisions, but the defection of a group of experienced senior officers possibly indicates a wider issue of war weariness, or low morale.
Prisoners were normally exchanged as soon as possible, but the French refused William's demand in August for the return of the 6,000 - 7,000 troops captured at Diksmuide and Deinze, due to a dispute over the terms. All sides were short of manpower by this stage of the war; deserting to receive a signing-on bonus was common, particularly as these were paid immediately while wages were often months in arrears. Since the recruiters were paid a bounty for each enlistee, the financial benefits to the French officers involved were considerable.
One suggestion is this may have been a factor in the surrender; nearly 3,000 of the prisoners were forced into French regiments, and sent to fight in Italy or Catalonia. In retaliation, despite the garrison of Namur being allowed to surrender on terms, its commander Boufflers was not released until the remaining Allied prisoners were returned in September.
After their release, Duncanson was promoted for refusing to sign the surrender; the others were tried by a court martial, held between 10 and 25 October, headed by Sir Henry Belasyse. O'Farrell, Graham, and the others were either dismissed or sanctioned, but quickly reinstated; O'Farrell ended as a Major-General. Ellenberg was sentenced to death by beheading, and executed in Ghent on 30 November.

Plot.
Tomita Tamako is a child table tennis prodigy. She has been undergoing vigorous table tennis training by her mom. But after her mom died, she quit the sport and never played again. She fell in love with her company's male table tennis player Ejima Akihiko. But Akihiko cheated on her when the company recruited a new female table tennis player, Airi Ogasawara, and they broke up. Dejected, she quit her job and returned to her hometown.
She then discovered that her father, a taxi driver, is deeply in debt. He asked her to help him out. She initially worked in a canned food factory but was soon fired for her clumsiness. Left with no other option, she took over the family's rundown table tennis club which only has five members. Meanwhile, Hagiwara Hisashi, a divorced former boxer, is working in construction nearby and he decided to take up table tennis and joined the club, because his daughter has taken up the sport.
In order to gain fame and recruit more members, Tamako decided to enter the national tournament. Tamako chose to enter Mixed Doubles as it is easier to win than singles. As the other members have found their partners Tamako is reluctantly paired with Hagi.
All 3 pairs suffered huge defeats in the regional tournament, but they vowed to continue training in order to play again one year later. They recruited the Chinese restaurant owners, who were China national table tennis team rejects, to help with their training. After months of intense training, Tamako and Hagi finally defeat the Chinese restaurant pair and are ready for the regional tournament.
Hagi's ex-wife and daughter turned up at the table tennis club and said they would like him to return and has found him a job. But the job interview is on the same date of the tournament. Realizing this is a chance for Hagi to re-establish his relationship with his family, Tamako decided not to join the tournament and went back to work in the canned food factory.
The other pairs, despite better performances, suffered defeats in the first rounds. Hagi sought out Tamako in the canned food factory, he told her his ex-wife and daughter already established new lives with another man and declared his love for her. The pair arrived at the tournament in time for their match. They advanced to the final and face Tamako's former boyfriend Ejima Akihiko and Airi Ogasawara. The match lasted until the last set when Ejima Akihiko won the match by a lucky reflex save.
Despite the loss, Tamako and Hagi found fame and the table tennis club turned into a hugely popular club.

President Barack Obama (painting)

President Barack Obama is a 2018 portrait of Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States, by the artist Kehinde Wiley for the National Portrait Gallery.
Summary.
In October 2017, it was announced that Wiley had been chosen by Barack Obama to paint an official portrait of the former president to appear in Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery "America's Presidents" exhibition. The painting depicts Obama sitting in a chair seemingly floating among foliage. The foliage is described by the author as "chrysanthemums (the official flower of Chicago), jasmine (symbolic of Hawaii where the president spent most of his childhood) and African blue lilies (alluding to the president's late Kenyan father)." Reacting to the unveiling of his portrait Obama said: "How about that? That's pretty sharp". "The Washington Post" described the painting as "not what you'd expect and that's why it's great". 
Together with Amy Sherald's portrait of Michelle Obama, the paintings were unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery on February 12, 2018. Both portraits mark the first time two African-American artists were commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery.
Reception.
The unveiling of the portrait led to thousands of visitors lining up at the entrance, and a threefold increase in visitors compared to the prior President's Day Weekend. At the unveiling, Obama appreciated Wiley's ability to show “the beauty and the grace and the dignity” of black people in a grand way. Obama commended the painting for avoiding making him “look like Napoleon” as many of Wiley's previous subjects were on horseback. National Gallery Director Kim Sajet supported both the selection and the artist's rendition, commending Wiley on his ability to integrate popular culture into the realm of high art.
Online media outlets had mixed reactions to the painting. Some see the portraits as political and historical commentary; elegant as an attempt to subvert the racist insults experienced by Obama during his presidency but vibrant enough to entice the viewer. The Obama portrait may also uphold the public image of the man himself as an intelligent, serious problem solver. The piece has more critically been described as "weird" and that the president sits "awkwardly perched on the edge of his chair". 
The public response on social media ranged from likening it to simplistic art, to humorous reflections on the portrait in the form of memes, featuring cartoon character Homer Simpson and using wordplay to comment on the use of bushes in the portrait, comparing the bushes to the family of Obama's predecessor George W. Bush.

Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen

Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen, also Christiane Constantin Hansen, (16 September 1848–13 July 1925) was a Danish weaver, textile artist and retailer who specialized in embroidery. A daughter of the celebrated painter Constantin Hansen, together with the daughter of another Golden Age figure, she opened an embroidery shop in central Copenhagen in 1873. The business proved to be highly successful over the next 30 years, attracting custom from individuals, churches and schools, and receiving several international awards. It closed in 1903 to enable Konstantin-Hansen and her colleague Johanne Bindesbøll to create large tapestries for Frederiksborg Castle. Konstantin-Hansen was also active as a pioneering feminist.
Biography.
Born in Copenhagen on 16 September 1848, Christiane Constantin Hansen was the eldest child of the celebrated Danish painter Carl Christian Constantin Hansen (1804–80) and his wife Magdalene Barbara Købke (1825–98). She was brought up with her eight siblings in a home reflecting her father's interest in fine furniture and decorative art. It was Georgia Skovgaard (1828–68), the wife of the painter P.C. Skovgaard, who taught her embroidery but she developed her drawing skills in 1873 as she travelled with her father to Rome, Naples and Pompei, sketching the classical monuments.
Konstantin-Hansen first practised embroidery at home but in 1873, together with Johanne Bindesbøll, daughter of the architect Thorvald Bindesbøll, she opened a shop on Købmagergade in central Copenhagen. For a number of years, they were joined by the embroiderer Anna Sarauw. Thanks to Konstantin-Hansen's orderly approach and the skills of the artists, the business ran successfully for a full 30 years. Georgia Skovgaard had introduced them to the embroidery of wild flowers, complemented by Johanna Bindesbøll's skilled depictions of flora and fauna in the classical Greek and Roman styles. Many of their patterns were based on the artwork of P.C. Skovgaard, Constantin Hansen, and Thorvald Bindesbøll. They transferred their designs to wool-on-canvas cross-stitching patterns which could be more easily mastered by their customers. The artists themselves, however, produced a variety of textiles decorated with even the most complex embroidery techniques.
The business took part in several international art exhibitions, receiving awards at Amsterdam's Industry Exhibition (1877), the World Exhibition in Paris (1878) and Copenhagen's Nordic Exhibition of 1888.
When it closed in 1903, the embroiderer Clara Wæver acquired most of the designs and patterns, using them to enhance her own work and the goods offered by her embroidery business.
Feminist pioneer.
From 1889, Konstantin-Hansen was also an early member of the feminist movement in Denmark, becoming a board member of the Danish Women's Society until 1892 and of the Copenhagen branch until 1897. In addition, she was one of the first three board members of the women's organization "Fru Rovsings Mindelegat" in 1889. She served on the committee specializing in women's job training. She was particularly interested in encouraging women to stand on their own feet and fought for women's suffrage. Believing it was important for women to dress appropriately for work, in 1890 she proposed setting up facilities for sewing so-called reform clothes which until then had been imported from Germany. She contributed to the selection of Danish exhibitors to the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and served on the committee behind the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition.
Kristiane Konstantin-Hansen died in Copenhagen on 13 July 1925.

Ann Elizabeth Wee

Ann Elizabeth Wee ("née" Wilcox; 19 August 1926 – 11 December 2019) was a British-born Singaporean academic and social worker, who was called the founding mother of social work in Singapore. She was known for pioneering professional social work in Singapore and as the longest-serving head of the Department of Social Work in the National University of Singapore. She was the inaugural recipient of the lifetime volunteer achievement award of the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports in 2009, was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal in 2010 and was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame in 2014.
Early life.
Ann Elizabeth Wilcox was born on 19 August 1926 in Corbridge, Northumberland, England to a middle-class family. Her father was an insurance salesman and her mother was a homemaker. After finishing her A-levels, in 1944 Wilcox joined the Red Cross and worked as a live-in domestic at Howick Hall. The former home of the Prime Minister Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, for whom the famous tea is named, had been turned into a military hospital, during World War II. 
When she completed her service, Wilcox began attending the London School of Economics, reading economics. In 1945, the school was evacuated because of bombings to Cambridge University. While continuing her studies in Cambridge, Wilcox met a Singaporean law student, Harry Lee Wee, at a social function and they began dating. In 1946, both Wilcox and Wee returned to London. He completed an internship as a legal clerk and took his law examination and she finished her undergraduate degree in economics in 1947 and began her master's studies in social anthropology. Harry returned to Singapore in 1948, while Wilcox remained in London to complete her schooling. She also did relief work in the slum neighborhoods of London, taking social surveys when the war ended. In March, 1950, Wilcox began the three-month voyage to reunite with Harry in Singapore and on 28 June 1950, the couple were married at St Andrew's Cathedral.
Career.
Soon after her marriage, three teachers resigned from posts at the Methodist Girls' School and Wee was urged by her mother-in-law to apply for a position. She would teach at the school for four years. In 1952, she also began teaching social work classes at the National University of Singapore (NUS), which at the time was known as the University of Malaya in Singapore, on a part-time basis. Throughout 1955 and 1956, Wee worked in the Social Welfare Department of the government. She worked as a training officer and was required to make home visits for the counseling and advice section. During her assessments in shanty towns and shops in Chinatown, she had to learn Cantonese and Hokkien on the job, so that she could communicate with her clients. At the end of 1956, Wee left government service when a full-time teaching post opened up at the university in the Social Studies Department.
In 1967, Wee applied for the post of Department Head for the university's Department of Social Work and formally assumed the post in 1968. Over the next two decades, she worked to implement policy and change the perception that social workers were not professionals but suppliers of "tea and sympathy". When other departments were eliminated, she fought for social work to be retained and an honours course to be added to the department's curriculum. In 1970, Wee began working with the Juvenile Court as an advisor in child protection. She also served as an advisor to the Ministry of Social Affairs on women's and girl's issues and on the board of both the National Youth Leadership Training Institute and the National Trades Union Congress, advising on a program to implement dental care. She was awarded the Bintang Bakti Masyarakat by President Benjamin Sheares in 1973. Working as the department head until her retirement in 1986, her career spanned the longest term as department head in the history of the university. Despite retiring as head of the department, Wee continued teaching as an associate professor at NUS. In 2004, she authored "Social Work in the Singapore Context", the "only textbook on social work in Singapore". Wee continued her involvement as a social worker with the juvenile courts until 2009, retiring with almost four decades of service.
In 2009, Wee became the inaugural honoree for the lifetime volunteer achievement award presented by the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports to recognize her work with the Juvenile Courts. She was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal in 2010 for her pioneering efforts in social work, often being referred to as the "founding mother" of the field in Singapore. In 2014, she was inducted into the Singapore Women's Hall of Fame. She published her memoir, "A Tiger Remembers: The Way We Were in Singapore" in 2016. The "Ann Wee NUS Social Work Alumni Award", is presented in her honor by the National University of Singapore to recognize excellence in social work.
Death and legacy.
Wee died on 11 December 2019 at age 93. She is remembered as the 'founding mother' of social work in Singapore.

Living review

In academic publishing, a "living" review is a review article, published electronically, that is updated at intervals to reflect the current state of research. Unlike in a print journal, a reader reading an old version of a review will automatically be aware that a newer version exists. While different versions of the review have to be cited separately, a living review acts as version control for the existing state of research.
For instance, the first article published in "Living Reviews in Relativity" was
In 2008, an updated version was produced:
The authors and titles of living reviews will typically remain the same from version to version, although this is not an absolute rule. Authors could change due to additional researchers joining a collaboration, retirement, or death. The title of the review will also typically remain the same, although development in the field may require adjusting the title to reflect the current state of research, or an adjustment in the scope of the review.
Some academic journals that publish living reviews are the "Living Reviews" astrophysics journal series, and the "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews" in medicine.

<doc id="56730925" url="?curid=56730925" title="Ideal theory (politics)">
Ideal theory (politics)

In political philosophy, an ideal theory is a theory which specifies the optimal societal structure based on idealised assumptions and normative theory. It stems from the assumption that citizens are fully compliant to a state which enjoys favorable social conditions, which makes it unrealistic in character.  Ideal theories do not offer solutions to real world problems, instead the aim of ideal theory is to provide a guide for improvements based on what society should normatively appear to be. Another interpretation of ideal theories is that they are end-state theories.
Ideal theory is contrasted with non-ideal theory in political philosophy. Scholars such as Amartya Sen provide a critique on ideal theory as an approach for being too idealistic and unnecessary.
The distinction between ideal theory and non-ideal theory was first proposed by John Rawls in "A Theory of Justice". Rawls' reasoning behind using ideal theory is that it provides a necessary base for non-ideal theories to follow. His conception of the world in his work is based on an ideal perfect society. In this society, principles of justice are created behind a “veil of ignorance”,  which situates citizens outside their social position in order for them to bargain without the influence of their self-interest. The main claim of Rawls’ ideal hypothesis is that there would be no disadvantaged or advantaged group, therefore, a situation of ideal equal fairness would be in place.
Ideal theory vs. non- ideal theory.
Ideal theory assumes full compliance, citizens are subject to the rules of a state and fully adhere to them. These rules need not be just but the compliance to them is what contributes to the optimum of a society. Rules in ideal theory often outline what ought to take precedence in order for favorable conditions to appear and be maintained. In contrast with the principle of full compliance of ideal theory, partial compliance is a characteristic of non-ideal theory. Full compliance cannot be realised within non-ideal theories because these take into consideration unfavourable social conditions which lead to negative consequences such as crises. Partial compliance more closely resembles a realistic social configuration of today, thus another feature that differs between ideal and non-ideal theories is the realistic elements in each.
In terms of idealisation and reality, Colin Farelly and Charles Mills suggest that normative debates cannot be addressed by ideal theory because the assumptions on which these rest are false. This also forms part of the criticism given by Amartya Sen, who argues that ideal theory is too idealistic. Instead, non-ideal theory provides proposals based on situations which are observable in social reality.
Ideal theory provides a view of how society ought to be like and indicates the principles that have to be in place in order to achieve it. This idealized vision exists as a long term goal or something to strive to due to the assumptions it lies upon. This qualifies ideal theory as an end-state theory. Non-ideal theory is seen as a transitional theory because the means through which social issues are presented are through improvements which are based on the existing social reality instead of an out-of-reach vision.

During the development of the southern part of the state, the Cromartie family continued to move further south. During one part of her childhood, the family lived near a settlement named Owens on the Peace River around from Arcadia.
They moved onto Juno, Florida, and then later to Lemon City where her schooling was completed. She sought to become a teacher immediately and trained through the summer following graduation. She was assigned to work at the school in Fort Lauderdale. She arrived prior to the completion of the construction of the school building and stayed with a school trustee and his family for several months. The one-room school opened in 1899 to serve the six families in the surrounding area.
Life in Fort Lauderdale.
She met Frank Stranahan shortly after arriving in Fort Lauderdale. He had opened a trading post in 1893 to trade with the local Seminoles and also held the local contract for mail delivery. The pair courted, and after she returned to Lemon City at the end of the school year, she accepted Stranahan's proposal of marriage. After taking a trip following the wedding to visit family members, they settled back in Fort Lauderdale and built Pioneer House, later known as Stranahan House.
Ivy taught English to the local Seminole children, as well as tutoring them in the Bible. She began heavily involved in Seminole affairs with the local Government and became the Chair of the Indian Affairs Committee of the Florida Federation of Women's Clubs. Although she had petitioned for a permanent Indian reservation for the Seminoles, when this was granted in 1917, it was her rival Minnie More-Wilson who received most of the credit through her Friends of the Florida Seminoles organisation. Only a year earlier, Ivy had attempted to remove More-Wilson from the Indian Affairs Committee.
By 1924, the expansion of Fort Lauderdale had begun in earnest and there was pressure for the Seminoles to move to the approved area set aside as a reservation. She entered their existing camp and convinced members of the group to join her on an expedition to the Dania Reservation. Ivy arranged for the Seminoles to be paid to make the Reservation habitable, and began transporting work parties to and from the location. She arranged for timber to be delivered courtesy of the Indian Commissioner at Fort Myers and by the end of the year several homes, a school and an administrative building had been built on the site and all the Seminoles had moved.
She had promised that once moved, they would not need to move again. However, within ten years, this promise was broken as the Government was looking to move the Seminoles to the Brighton Reservation. Ivy fought the order, and it was eventually revoked. She continued to work on introducing Christianity into the Seminoles and successfully integrated them into the Southern Baptist Convention. This was following the foundation of a new Friends of the Florida Seminoles organisation, which was often confused with the former under More-Wilson. The new version of the organisation named Ivy as Secretary-Treasurer, and she would remain involved with the group for the rest of her life. Together they sought to stem the growing alcohol issue in the Seminoles by educating the women about the problems it could bring.
In the 1940s, the focus had switched to ensuring the ongoing education of the children of the Seminoles. When the Friends of the Florida Seminoles, Florida Foundation Inc. was chartered in 1949 as a non-profit organisation, Ivy Julia Cromartie Stranahan was listed as President. The organisation grew, allowing it to support the construction of new homes on the reservation. When Government support was withdrawn in 1954, Ivy and her Friends society helped the Seminoles to set themselves up as a business, allowing them to organise themselves as the Seminole Tribe of Florida, Inc. in 1957.

Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk (died 1715)

Henrietta Howard, Countess of Suffolk (c.1669 – 10 August 1715), formerly Lady Henrietta Somerset, was the second wife of Henry Howard, 6th Earl of Suffolk.
Lady Henrietta Somerset was the daughter of Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort, and his wife, the former Mary Capell.
On 24 June 1686, Lady Henrietta married Henry Horatio O'Brien, son of the Earl of Thomond, who had inherited the courtesy title "Lord Ibrackan" from his elder half-brother in 1678. They had two children:
Her son Henry inherited the titles of his grandfather, Henry O'Brien, 7th Earl of Thomond.
Lord Ibrackan died of smallpox in 1690. In April 1705, his widow married Henry Howard, MP, whose wife, Lady Auberie Anne Penelope O'Brien, daughter of the 7th Earl of Thomond (and sister of Henrietta's first husband), had died in November 1703, leaving him with four sons and a daughter. Henry Howard, then heir to the earldom of Suffolk, was created 1st Earl of Bindon at the end of 1706, making his wife a countess. He became Earl of Suffolk in 1709.
In 1706, Henry Howard's youngest brother, Charles, married his sister-in-law's namesake, Henrietta Hobart, the ward of Henry and Charles's father, the 5th Earl of Suffolk. This other Henrietta would become notorious as a royal mistress.
Henrietta and her second husband had no children. On his death in 1718, he was succeeded in the earldom and in his Lord-Lieutenancy by Charles William, his eldest surviving son from his first marriage.
Henrietta died at Audley End, Essex, and was buried in the Howard family vault at Saffron Walden.

Brexbach

The Brexbach (historically: "Brachysa") is a river, just under long, and an orographically left-hand tributary of the Saynbach in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
Course.
The "Brexbach" is formed by the uniting of the "Hinterster Bach" and "Vorderster Bach" in the Grenzhausen municipal forest east of Höhr-Grenzhausen. Many consider the "Hinterster Bach" simply as the name for the upper reaches of the Brexbach.
From the confluence of its two headstreams by some fish ponds, the Brexbach initially runs along the upper edge of the municipality of Höhr-Grenzhausen. In the upper Brexbach valley there was once a mustard mill ("Senfmühle"), which burned down in 1914 - a memorial stone marks the spot - and other mills: the "Farbmühle", "Niesmühle" and the "Kühnsmühle", none of which are used as mills any longer.
The Brexbach next reaches the village of Grenzau (a district of Höhr-Grenzhausen) and flows through it below Grenzau Castle. Grenzau station is the terminus for the Brexbach Valley Railway, a line that closed to passenger services in 1989 and goods trains in 1994, but which partly reopened in 2009 as a heritage railway.
Parallel to the historical railway bed runs the Brexbach Gorge Way ("Brexbachschluchtweg" including the "Wäller-Tour" and "Saynsteig" paths), a very varied and, in places, challenging, hiking trail along steep and thickly wooded hillsides. It reaches the Brexbach Valley Pathfinder Camp ("Pfadfindercamp Brexbachtal") in a meadow bottom; for three kilometres there are camping places, some with refuge huts, and a camp chapel.
The lower reaches of the Brexbach run past the former , flow through the village of Sayn below Sayn Castle immediately next to the old defensive wall, before emptying into the Saynbach in the park of . The Saynbach discharges into the Rhine in the area of Bendorf harbour.

? (XXXTentacion album)

? is the second studio album by American rapper XXXTentacion and his last studio album to be released before his death. It was released on March 16, 2018, by Bad Vibes Forever, Caroline Distribution, and Capitol Music Group. It succeeds the release of his debut studio album "17" (2017) and the extended play "A Ghetto Christmas Carol" (2017). The album was primarily produced by frequent collaborator John Cunningham, and includes guest appearances from PnB Rock, Travis Barker, Joey Badass, and Matt Ox.
Featuring more live instrumentation than "17", "?" features an array of genres, including acoustic, emo, alternative rock, trap, and cloud rap. XXXTentacion's vocals on parts the album are less restrained and lo-fi-ish compared to "17", with his vocals on introspective songs over piano and acoustic guitar chords being more projected. On other parts of the album, XXXTentacion's style resembles his underground sound, with him screaming. 
"?" received generally positive reviews from critics, and became XXXTentacion's first US number-one album, debuting at number one on the "Billboard" 200 with 131,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week. The album has since been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was supported by three singles: "Sad!", "Changes", and "Moonlight". Following XXXTentacion's death on June 18, 2018, "Sad!" topped the "Billboard" Hot 100, where XXXTentacion became the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist since The Notorious B.I.G. with "Mo Money Mo Problems" in 1997.
At the 2019 "Billboard" Music Awards, "?" was nominated for Top "Billboard" 200 Album, among other nominations. An anniversary deluxe edition of the album was originally going to be released on July 26, 2019, but was pushed back to September 6, 2019, featuring the album's instrumentals, "A Ghetto Christmas Carol", voice memos from the recording sessions of the album, and new material featuring American rapper Rico Nasty and Japanese video game composer Yoko Shimomura.
Background.
XXXTentacion released his debut studio album, "17" in August 2017 to commercial success. Following the release of the album, he announced he was quitting music due to negativity and backlash, though he eventually signed a $6 million one-album deal with Caroline Distribution and released "A Ghetto Christmas Carol" EP on his SoundCloud on December 11, 2017.
After the release of "A Ghetto Christmas Carol", XXXTentacion announced he was preparing three new albums and eventually announced the titles of the albums as "Bad Vibes Forever", "Skins", and "?", after being released on house arrest on December 23, 2017. The track listing and release date was confirmed by XXXTentacion on March 12, 2018, via social media.
Composition.
A contrast to "17", the album features an array of genres, including alternative rock, emo, trap, acoustic, and cloud rap. The song "I Don't Even Speak Spanish lol" has been labelled as reggaeton pop, while "Infinity (888)" is a classic hip hop song. XXXTentacion's vocals on parts the album are less restrained and lo-fi-ish compared to "17", with his vocals over piano and acoustic guitar chords being more projected. On other parts of the album, XXXTentacion's style resembles his underground sound pre-"Look at Me", with him portraying anger through screaming. The album also features sounds similar to the Soundcloud rap scene, as XXXTentacion mumble raps over less serious themes.
Promotion.
The cover art was first shown on XXXTentacion's Instagram story on January 28, 2018, with the caption "coming soon". Later that day, he explained that:"This albums not about the words, it's about the feeling...it'll be very hard to understand, but very easy to listen to...it's not what you're expecting, even if you feel like you understand my music, be prepared to not understand this music."XXXTentacion released the song "Hope" on his SoundCloud on February 21, 2018, dedicated to the survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. XXXTentacion later hosted a benefit show for the survivors on March 18, 2018, and offered condolences to the victims of the shooting. On February 25, 2018, after the release of "Hope", the rapper posted vague messages on social media accusing Canadian rapper Drake of threatening to murder him alongside crude photoshopped images of Drake. XXXTentacion proceeded to claim his accounts were hacked whilst there was speculation he was insulting the rapper for promotion of "Sad!" and “Changes”.
Singles.
The lead singles "Sad!" and "Changes" were released March 2, 2018, for streaming and digital download. "Sad!" debuted at number 17, and peaked at number one on the "Billboard" Hot 100, becoming XXXTentacion's first number-one song and his highest-charting single to date. XXXTentacion became the first act to earn a posthumous Hot 100 number-one single as a lead artist since The Notorious B.I.G. with "Mo Money Mo Problems" in 1997. "Changes" debuted at number 47 on the week beginning March 13, 2018, and peaked at number 18. The album's third single "Moonlight" was released posthumously to rhythmic radio on August 14, 2018. "Moonlight" peaked at 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 after XXXTentacion's murder.
The Rico Nasty remix of "#ProudCatOwner" was released in August 2019 as a promotional single for the album's deluxe edition.
Critical reception.
In a positive review, online publication "HotNewHipHop" stated that "Despite a sagging middle section, "?" features some of X's most nuanced and impressive material to date", adding that "X's commitment to honoring his various influences is admirable, but it may have behooved him to spend a little bit more time on sequencing this artistic kaleidoscope." "XXL" gave the album a positive review, and wrote "The album sonically goes every which way—a double-edge sword that can make for a dizzying, disjointed listen at times. Still, "?" is X's most stimulating offering to date and with a little more focus on structure and cohesion, X's best work could very well be ahead of him."
At the 2019 "Billboard" Music Awards, "?" was nominated for Top "Billboard" 200 Album, among other nominations.
Commercial performance.
"?" debuted at number one on the US "Billboard" 200 with 131,000 album-equivalent units, with 20,000 pure album sales. It was XXXTentacion's only US number-one album during his lifetime. The album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on August 7, 2018.
"?" also reached number one in Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, and Sweden. Following XXXTentacion's death, the album reached a new peak of number one in the Netherlands. It also ascended the "Billboard" 200 from number twenty-four to three, earning 94,000 units. As well as the United States, the album has been certified platinum in Canada, France, Italy, Sweden, and triple platinum in Denmark.
An anniversary deluxe edition of the album was originally going to be released on July 26, 2019, but was pushed back to September 6, 2019, featuring the album's instrumentals, the EP "A Ghetto Christmas Carol" (2017), voice memos from the recording sessions of the album, and new material featuring American rapper Rico Nasty and Japanese video game composer Yoko Shimomura.

Media deconvergence

Media deconvergence is an original term coined to describe the breaking apart of companies through spin-offs, split-offs and demergers, which grew in numbers as a consequence of the failure of many mergers and consolidations realized in the late 1990s and in the first decade of the 21st century in the media and communications sectors. AOL-Time Warner, whose merger took place in 2000 and ended in 2009, and Viacom, which split into the CBS Corporation and the current incarnation of Viacom in 2005, are good examples of media (market) deconvergence.
Like media convergence, media deconvergence is believed to be a consequence of technological convergence, as many companies in these sectors have followed either the strategy of expanding their reach with mergers and acquisitions, or the strategy of refocusing their operations around core activities, by splitting up or spinning off secondary activities into dedicated companies. As both these strategies have been adopted by companies in the media and communications sector at different points in time, from the viewpoint of the sector, media deconvergence is a process that occurs as a reaction, but also in parallel to, the convergence of media markets.
More recently, media deconvergence has also been applied more broadly to indicate other consequences and assumptions that are alternative to the process of media convergence, as it was traditionally or most commonly understood. As an example, media deconvergence has been used to describe a media environment that is becoming more complex, where more technologies and services are used, rather than one where old technologies (like television or radio) are replaced by new ones. Media deconvergence has also been used to refute the idea that technological convergence is favoured by deregulation, because technological convergence introduces new challenges, such as the protection of privacy or the respect of copyrights, which require new policies and regulations. Also, rather than concentrating on the possibilities that have become available from accessing the same digital content from different devices, media deconvergence privileges the study of transmedia flow of content, such as transmedia storytelling.
The term "deconvergence" was chosen and preferred to the term "divergence", because the processes described by media deconvergence unfolds also in parallel to, instead of departing from, processes described by media convergence.

List of compositions by Johann Peter Pixis

Johann Peter Pixis (1788-1874) was a German musician born in Mannheim; the major parts of his career were spent in Vienna and Paris. He was among many musicians, especially pianists, who came to Paris starting about 1820. Pixis became very successful as a pianist, composer, and collaborative musician. The majority of his published compositions are for piano, including works with orchestra, but he also wrote operas during his years in Vienna—though these were not successful—and chamber music. Among his strongest mature compositions are the seven piano trios ("grand trios").
This list largely reproduces the entry for Pixis in Franz Pazdirek, "Universal Handbook of Musical Literature: Practical and Complete Guide to all Musical Publications" (Vienna, 1904?; reprint London and Philadelphia), vol. 14, pp. 392–394. Pazdirek organized the entry chronologically. In this list, compositions are sorted by genre.

2018 Baku fire

On 2 March 2018, a fire broke out at the Republican Narcological Dispensary in Baku, Azerbaijan, a drug rehabilitation facility for patients with opiate addiction.
Around 200 people including patients and members of the clinic staff had to be evacuated from the area, while 34 had to be rescued from the blazing building. At least 26 people died, and another four were hospitalized. Although the fire was initially blamed on faulty wiring, it later emerged that the fire had actually started when a patient tried to commit suicide by self-immolation. The individual had second thoughts and tossed his burning blanket into the wooden ward, igniting the early morning inferno.
Two days after the incident the authorities arrested former patient Mahammad Mammadov and charged him with murder and arson, among other crimes. Civil rights activists blamed government corruption for lax fire safety measures in the facility that may have led to the accident. In the aftermath, President Ilham Aliyev created a commission to investigate the underlying causes of the accident and announced plans to build a fully equipped Rehab centre nearby.
Background.
Drug crisis.
Azerbaijan's proximity to both Afghanistan and Iran and its location on the drug route known as the "Balkan Route" make it an easy drug corridor, and due to lax border control most of the illegal drugs (around 90%) are able to get through. It has been estimated that around 1,000 tonnes of drugs are smuggled through the country each year. According to estimates registered drug addicts in the country numbered 7,000 in 1996, however by 2006 this number had risen to 20,000, while some estimates put it at around 30,000. There is a severe shortage of personnel when it comes to treating drug addiction. According to the head of the working group for the Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking State Commission Araz Aliguliyev, "there are too few psychologists, social workers and almost no NGOs" working in the field of addiction rehabilitation.
Dilapidated state of rehabilitation centre.
Azerbaijan spends around $2.00 on a single treatment, as opposed to the Western nations where the mean expenditure is around $100.00. There is a distinct lack of drug rehabilitation centres in the country with only 53 state-funded clinics and dispensaries in the entire country. These centres are usually established in Soviet-era barracks like buildings that are derelict to begin with. The Republican Narcological Center was built as a dispensary in 1986, and was further enlarged in 2011 to cater for 250 patients.
According to reports, the dispensary was housed in an old, one-story, wooden building dating from the 1900s. Buildings with materials such as these are fire hazards and Azerbaijan has a history of large-scale fires in residential buildings. According to sources, the victims relatives have stated that the facility was "decrepit", paint was peeling from the walls, that had been constructed with plywood, and the equipment used by the facility was outdated as well; having been bought in 1991 before the Soviet Union collapsed. Former head physician at the Respublika Narkoloji Mərkəzi, Araz Aliguliyev stated that during his tenure (which ended in 2006) the building in question had been used only for housing archives and for "some accounting purposes". He said that patients were never housed in the building as it was an old and decrepit building dating from the 1990s. He said "I don't know why they were using it to treat patients".
Fire.
The government reported that the fire broke out at around 06:10 local time. A security guard stationed outside the facility was able to open the doors when he smelled smoke and started the evacuation. However the fire soon engulfed the building. Ten ambulances and 10 squads of firefighters with 43 fire engines were dispatched to the site. It took the 160 personnel of the State Fire Protection Service around three hours to successfully extinguish the blaze.
It was originally believed to be caused by an electrical fault in the one-story, wooden ward, but the government later stated that arson was the cause. There was no automatic fire suppression system in the building. The building's wooden frame acted as the principal fuel source for the fire, and firefighters described the building burning intensely for over three hours due to strong winds. According to relatives of the patients, it was routine for the patients to be locked inside during the night. Some reports claim that the victims who were burnt alive may have been tied to their beds as a routine procedure and therefore they may have been unable to escape when the fire spread through the building. The building's windows had been barred with steel frames that could only be opened from the outside to prevent addicts from running away, and at least 55 of them were bedridden when the fire broke out. However, despite the barred windows, responding firefighters were able to rescue dozens of people from the fast-spreading fire. It was reported that by 8.20 am local time firefighters had brought the fire under control and it had been completely extinguished by 9:13.
Aftermath.
Hospitalization of survivors.
According to the Ministry of Healthcare, around 200 patients and staff were safely evacuated from the hospital, with 34 needing rescue. Twenty-five dead bodies were found in the ruins after firefighters extinguished the blaze. Four of the injured had to be hospitalized. Three were admitted to the Toxicology Department of the Clinical Medical Center No 1 and one was moved to the City Clinical Hospital No 3. The bodies of the deceased were moved to the mortuary, but it was reported that the charred remains were not yet recognizable.
Police investigation.
President Ilham Aliyev visited the scene and an official investigation was ordered. A hotline was established to the offices of the Prosecutor General, Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Emergency Affairs so that relatives of the patients and staff, as well as witnesses could contact the authorities.
Arrest.
On March 3, a former patient of the rehab center named Mahammad Mammadov was arrested and charged with premeditated murder, multiple murders, and damaging property.
It was reported that Mammadov was being treated at the centre but wished to leave. In a suicide attempt he set fire to his blanket, but changed his mind when the flames started to engulf him. He then threw off the blanket, and left the building when the fire started to spread and the wooden infrastructure of the ward caught fire. The arrest of Mammadov contradicted earlier reports of the fire being caused by a short circuit. After the arrest Mammadov was subject to psychological and psychiatric evaluations.
State commission.
President Ilham Aliyev created a state commission chaired by Abid Sharifov, the deputy president. It was tasked with investigating the fire, providing assistance to the families of the victims, resettling the staff and patients of the centre and making sure that the destroyed building is reconstructed quickly. The commission will also include the Prosecutor General as well as the ministers of health, economics, internal affairs, crisis, and social welfare of population.
Plans for a new building.
On March 2, the Health Ministry stated that plans had been put in place to build a new Drug Abuse Treatment Center in Sabunchu district of Baku. The new Rehabilitation Centre will consist of four buildings and will house 300 patients. It will also be supplied with the latest equipment.
Allegations of corruption.
Rights groups in Azerbaijan have long accused the authoritarian regime of President Aliyev of prevalent corruption that, according to them, undermines the functioning of state institutions. So local civil activists blamed public corruption and lack of compliance with fire safety regulations as major contributors to the blaze. The head of the civil advocacy group Property Rights said "Fire safety regulations were not respected in the hospital’s Soviet-era wooden building". She further stated “As a result of systemic corruption, an adequate control over the compliance with fire safety norms is not in place in Azerbaijan.” The General Prosecutor's's Office responded by opening an investigation into possible violations of fire safety codes.
Reactions.
 China — Xi Jinping, the president of China, sent a letter of condolence to Ilham Aliyev. He wrote, "Dear Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the terrible news of numerous casualties in fire in the Drug Rehabilitation Center in Baku".
 Russia — Russian President Vladimir Putin has offered his condolences to President Ilham Aliyev, while the head of the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations, Vladimir Puchkov expressed his condolences to his counterpart in Azerbaijan, Kyamaledin Heydarov stating "We mourn together with you".
 Turkmenistan — Gurbangulu Berdimuhamedov, the president of Turkmenistan, expressed his condolences, saying "At this difficult time, I ask you to convey to all the relatives and friends of the victims that I, on behalf of the people and government of Turkmenistan and my own behalf, share their sorrow and wish patience and immediate recovery."
 Uzbekistan — Shavkat Mirziyoyev, the president of Uzbekistan, sent a letter of condolence, saying that he was deeply saddened by the news.
 Turkey — President Erdogan expressed deep sorrow over the incident and offered his condolences to the victims and their families.
Thorbjorn Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, Alexander Lukashenko President of Belarus, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Prime Minister of Georgia Georgi Kvirikashvili and Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev also expressed their condolences for the victims and their families.

Brigitte (Overwatch)

Brigitte Lindholm is a fictional player character who appears in the 2016 video game "Overwatch"—a first-person shooter developed by Blizzard Entertainment—and related animations and literary media. Although "Overwatch" was released in 2016, Brigitte was introduced as a playable support character in a March 2018 update for the game. Prior to her video game debut, she first appeared in "Dragon Slayer", an issue of the "Overwatch" digital comic series.
Gameplay.
Brigitte is classified as a support character and is listed as a one-star (low) difficulty character for players. Although she is listed as a support character, Blizzard developed her as a support–tank hybrid, as she both carries a barrier shield and is able to heal teammates.
Video game outlets "Gamespot", "USgamer", and "Engadget" described Brigitte's move set as an apt blending of Torbjörn and Reinhardt's abilities. Her move set includes her Rocket Flail melee attack, which has an extended range and allows her to strike multiple enemies in one swing. Brigitte's flail is also augmented with the Whip Shot ability, allowing her to throw her flail a long distance, dealing damage and knocking an enemy back in the process. Her Inspire ability allows her to passively heal nearby teammates over time when she hits enemies with her flail. Brigitte can also actively heal allies with her Repair Pack ability; as of the latest patch, Repair pack no longer gives teammates armor if it over heals them. Brigitte additionally comes equipped with a Barrier Shield, which is a "frontal energy barrier that can absorb a limited amount of damage," while also protecting allies behind it. While the shield is activated, players can use Brigitte's Shield Bash ability to dash forward, stunning an enemy hit by the dash. Brigitte's "Ultimate ability" is Rally, which allows her to move faster and provide all nearby allies with a temporary armor.
Matilda Smedius provides the voice for Brigitte.
Development and design.
Brigitte as a character had already been introduced within the lore of "Overwatch" as Torbjörn's daughter and friend to Reinhardt, through the "Dragon Slayer" digital comic released in 2016. Brigitte was developed alongside the character of Moira, who was the game's 26th hero. Originally named Pally, Blizzard had originally given her an ability to send out a healing orb to other teammates which had a long cooldown time. As they fleshed out both characters, they opted to push the tank-hybrid more for Pally, and transferred the healing orb to Moira, which would become part of her Biotic Orb abilities. As they worked more on Pally's character, they recognized her skill set integrated well with Brigitte's own story, and thus established the hero to the established lore.
"Overwatch"s developers designed Brigitte as a support–tank hybrid intended to counter the "dive" strategy that was dominating the current "Overwatch" metagame. With the dive strategy, a team would have a mobile character (such as Winston or Tracer) race into the back lines of a defending team while the defenders main tanks were elsewhere and unable to protect the weaker characters. This would be a sacrificial move by attacking teams, using the disruption to deal with the other remaining team. With Brigitte on defense, she would be able to stun and delay the diving character long enough to allow the defending team to react and close ranks, nullifying the dive strategy. Jeff Kaplan called the character, prior to her formal reveal, as "very needed" in the game.
In late February 2018, Brigitte was officially announced to be the 27th playable character in "Overwatch". In a developer update video introducing Brigitte, "Overwatch" developer Jeff Kaplan described Brigitte's gameplay abilities, detailing her design as a support–tank hybrid. Brigitte's "hybrid" description stems from the game incorporating both abilities seen in the tank role—like a barrier shield—as well as healing abilities in her skill set. Although referring to Brigitte as a "hybrid" character, Kaplan maintained that she is a primarily support character.
The character spent a few weeks playable only on Blizzard's "Public Test Realm" (PTR) server, before she was made fully available to players on March 20. After Brigitte was initially made available on Blizzard's PTR server, "PCGamesN" noted her ability to disrupt "dive comp", a team composition featuring tank character Winston and offense character Tracer. The outlet explained dive comps are "defined by mobile characters able to pounce on key enemy characters - typically their supports - before they can react, then mopping up the rest of the team once an advantage has been won." "PCGamesN" connected Brigitte's ability to disrupt this aspect of the game's meta to Kaplan's statements about how she would "shake up the meta."
Fictional character biography.
Brigitte's character backstory is tied into that of her father Torbjörn's and her godfather Reinhardt's. Outside of the game, Blizzard's fictional biography for Brigitte lists her full real name as Brigitte Lindholm, her age as 23, and her former base of operations as Gothenburg, Sweden.
In-universe, Brigitte is an adventurer and a mechanical engineer, following in the footsteps of her father, Torbjörn. Torbjörn, in Overwatch's lore, is the Chief Engineer for the Overwatch organization. One teaser for the Brigitte's character reveal described Reinhardt saving Torbjörn, after the latter gets severely injured on "Operation: White Dome", an Overwatch mission. In a letter to his pregnant wife, Torbjörn expresses that he will be allowing Reinhardt to name his daughter as a thankful gesture. After the dissolution of the Overwatch organization, Reinhardt chose to continue to fight for justice as a knight-errant. Brigitte requested to join him as his squire, and Reinhardt accepted and would train her in combat. Her responsibilities initially included maintaining Reinhardt's armor, but she increasingly began to have to heal Reinhardt's wounds. Brigitte began to believe her role was insufficient, and developed her own armor in secret to fight alongside Reinhardt. Brigitte also designed Reinhardt's shield.
Appearances.
Video games.
Brigitte made her video game debut in March 2018, when she was introduced into "Overwatch"s playable Hero roster.
Animations.
Brigitte appeared in the November 2017 animated short, "Honor and Glory", which centered around the character Reinhardt.
Coinciding with the announcement of Brigitte being included in "Overwatch"s playable character roster, Blizzard released a short animated origin story about her, focusing on her relationships with Torbjörn and Reinhardt.
Comics.
Brigitte made her first official appearance in any form of media in "Dragon Slayer", the second issue of "Overwatch"s digital comic series. "Dragon Slayer", released in April 2016, features Brigitte throughout, but focuses on Reinhardt defeating local thugs. She later appeared in the December 2016 issue "Reflections" in a panel featuring her family and Reinhardt.
Reception.
Brigitte's reveal led to Stewart Chisam—a game developer on Hi-Rez Studios' "Paladins"—posting a tweet, comparing Brigitte to Ash, a character from "Paladins". When reached for comment by "Kotaku", Chisam expressed that the tweet was a light-hearted joke and an "a bit of an homage to tons of "Overwatch" Clone comments "Paladins" received when it first came to market."
While Brigitte was added to "Overwatch" on March 20, 2018, she was not added to the servers for the 2018 Overwatch League season until the start of Stage 4, commencing in May 2018. To that point, many teams in the League had excelled on the dive composition, particularly the New York Excelsior, which had nearly secured their spot in the season finals. With Brigitte was added, other teams adapted her into their team compositions and were able to effectively counter the Excelsior's dive strategies, while Excelsior had not adapted to Brigitte's abilities during season play. Though Excelsior still was the League's top seed leading into the finals, they lost their semi-final round to the Philadelphia Fusion, in part because the Fusion had used Brigitte in their compositions to challenge Excelsior's dive approach.
In the months following her release, innumerable high-profile players complained that Brigitte was too powerful given her kit of crowd-control abilities, being able to hit multiple targets with her main attack and being able to stun with her shield bash. Some players argued to the point that Blizzard should remove the character from the game, creating a viral call out to "Delete Brig". In particular, Brigitte became a central support character in the popular "GOATS" team composition (named after the Overwatch Contenders team that popularized it) that includes three tanks and three support which had proven extremely difficult to counter; Brigitte's role in the GOATS, outside of healing, was to use her shield bash to break enemy character's shields. Blizzard had recognized the problems with Brigitte in the current metagame involving GOATS, but had no immediate plans to remove her from the game. Instead, they continued to work on various buffs and debuffs to make Brigitte less overpowering, in particular, removing the ability to stun characters through shields. With the start of the 2019 Overwatch League season, the GOATS composition was heavily used by many team, drawing negative audience reactions as such games tended to be viewed as unexciting. Some people on social media continued to blame the character of Brigitte for the lackluster league games, and in some cases, started harassing her voice actress, Matilda Smedius. Many more fans stood behind Smedius against the harassment, with Smedius appreciative of their support.
In July 2019, Blizzard introduced a role queue feature that limited teams to a composition with two of each of the three classes in competitive and most other game modes, which made a GOATS composition impossible, though Blizzard stated that this change was not aimed to deal with any specific team composition. Along with this feature came a character rework for Brigitte aimed at making her viable within the new default ruleset of the game, eliminating or ameliorating most common complaints usually brought up by players. Blizzard released a limited-available Brigitte cosmetic skin at the start of the 2020 Overwatch League season called "GOAT Brigitte" (GOAT for Greatest of All Time) but cheekily alluding to the GOATS team composition.

Hermine Berthold

Hermine Berthold (born Hermine Brühning: 22 March 1896 – 2 June 1990) was a worker, a politician (SPD), a during the Nazi years and a member of the Bremen parliament ("Bremische Bürgerschaft") both before and after that twelve-year hiatus.
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Hermine Auguste Brühning was born the illegitimate daughter of a serving-maid in , then a poor rural settlement just outside the city into which, for administrative purposes, it would be subsumed in 1902. While she was still a child her mother married the widowed father of seven children, and Hermine accordingly became the elder sister to seven step siblings. Her new stepfather was an activist member of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which ensured an early introduction to the rapidly changing world of socialist politics. After completing her time at junior school, in 1910 she followed her mother into domestic service. The period was one of rapid industrial expansion across much of western Europe, however, and "factory wages" were generally higher than those of domestic servants. Working hours in factories, although long by later standards, were generally neither as long nor as unpredictable as those experienced by domestic servants. After two years (like her future political colleague Käthe Popall) she took a job with the vast in the central quarter of Bremen. Her first son was born in 1915. The boy's father, a sailor called Hermann Berthold, married her three years later when her second son was born. Hermann had by this point lost his job at sea, and was working on the land, but this was not sufficiently well paid for him to support a family, and Hermine Berthold continued to work at the factory. By the time the couple's third son was born, in 1922, Hermann Berthold had become a dock worker. They could afford for Hermine to take a break from paid work and concentrate on the children, while also devoting more time to her political activities.
Politics.
Very soon after joining the workforce at the jute mill she became involved in the activities of the textile workers trades union ("Textilgewerkschaft") and of the Consumers' co-operative movement ("Konsumgenossenschaft"). She became a member of the and of the .
Hermine Berthold joined the Independent Social Democratic Party ("Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" / USPD) in 1918 or 1919. The USPD had broken away from the SPD in 1917, principally because members rejected the mainstream party's parliamentary support for funding the First World War. Around about the time she joined it, the USPD was itself undergoing a further split, with the leftwing majority (nationally) forming the nucleus of the new Communist Party. However, Hermine Berthold was one of the USPD members who remained in the party which then, in 1922, merged back into SPD. The war had finished and been followed by a year of revolutions in the cities, the toppling of the Kaiser and the launch of a republican governmental structure (which incorporated votes for women without much sign of the resistance that the notion encountered elsewhere in Europe). The party leadership's support for war credits back in 1914-18 was yesterday's issue. In the SPD Berthold took the initiative in creating a women's group inside the local party, and was very soon recruited onto the executive committee of the women's group in respect of the whole of Bremen, then operating under the leadership of Anna Stiegler. Sources indicate that Berthold was valued by party comrades at this time for her energy and for the "directness" of her approach.
In 1930 she was recommended as an SPD candidate for election to the Bremen parliament ("Bremische Bürgerschaft") and in the Autumn elections was duly elected. She remained a member until 15 March 1933 which was when the parliament, like other democratic institutions across Germany, dissolved itself in response to the enforced rapid transition towards one-party dictatorship which had been underway since the start of the year.
Nazi years.
She remained politically active during the Nazi years which was, by definition, illegal (except for Nazi Party supporters). Berthold retained particularly close links with Anna Stiegler. Meetings of the SPD local party executive still took place, but they were now defined as birthday parties. They were nevertheless effective opportunities for exchanging information and discussing ways in which the Nazi régime might more effectively be opposed. There was illegal printed material, smuggled in at great personal risk by covert couriers from abroad, to be located and distributed. Along with her "illegal party work" Hermine Berthold sustained her contacts with members of "Vorwärts", the consumer co-operative with which she had been working since the 1920s. The Nazis never disbanded the consumer co-operatives, even though they tended to be front organisations for the outlawed Social Democratic Party.
The intelligence services penetrated the Bremen SPD during 1934. In November 1934 Hermine Berthold and Anna Stiegler, along with a large number of party comrades were betrayed to the authorities and arrested. The charge was the usual one of "preparing to commit high treason" ("Vorbereitung zum Hochverrat"), and the sentence was a four year jail term. By the time of her trial and sentencing Berthold had already been held in "investigatory detention" at Bremen's "Ostertorwache" (as the establishment was then known). The next three years she spent at the women's prison at Lübeck-Lauerhof. Here she became friendly with the only communist from Bremen being held in Lübeck, Käthe Popall. After 1945, throughout West Germany, the relationship between the SPD and the Communist Party, became ever frostier, but in Bremen Hermine Berthold and Käthe Popall would remain the firmest of friends over the decades that followed. In 1938, her sentence expunged, Hermine Berthold was released. A year later, on 1 September 1939, as German and Soviet troops invaded Poland from opposite sides, Berthold was re-arrested because she had failed to comply with conditions imposed by the authorities. In defiance of Gestapo threats, she had continued to make contact with (politically inclined) friends from the pre-Nazi years. Three months after the re-arrest, to her surprise, she was released again. This seems to have been because, directly before her fre-arrest, her husband had suffered a fatal accident in the port, where he had evidently still been employed.
Loss.
The unexpected death of Hermann Berthold in 1939 was followed by the deaths of the Bertholds' second and third sons in the war. Their eldest son, described as "always delicate", survived, and continued to live with his mother till he died, still relatively young, in 1958. Public records indicate that by this time Berthold was also a grandmother, but sources are otherwise silent over her four grandchildren.
After the war.
Directly after the war, as she concentrated on making her half destroyed apartment habitable for herself and her surviving son, there was a determination to have nothing more to do with politics, but that quickly weakened and she became a member locally of an all-party ant-fascism association, which in the end was dissolved in December 1945. Bremen had ended up under US military occupation, quickly acquiring great strategic significance as the cold war unfolded, being the principal transit point in western Germany for the US military. Berthold was persuaded by comrades to rejoin the (no longer banned) Social Democratic Party, re-establishing the women's section of it. She became a member of the executive committee of the "greater" Bremen women's section of the SPD, now being re-created by Anna Stiegler.
October 1946 saw the first free elections to the now re-instated Bremen parliament ("Bremische Bürgerschaft") in sixteen years. On 16 October 1946 Berthold was elected to the assembly, remaining a member till 1959. In her "candidate leaflet" she presented herself as a woman who, as a factory worker, had "up close experience" of the class antagonisms in the capitalist system, and undertook to stand up, in particular, for working class voters. As a postwar parliamentarian she was a member of the groups dealing with nutrition, agriculture, labour and restitution. Colleagues found her diligent and reliable, but also quiet, preferring behind the scenes work to making speeches to the full. assembly.
Berthold also resumed her involvement in the local Consumers' co-operative movement, now on the supervisory board, working closely with Käthe Popall, her Communist friend from their time in prison together. She continued her co-operative work long after she retired, at the age of 63, from membership of the Bremen parliament.

RNA-targeting small molecule drugs

RNA-targeting small molecules represent a class of small molecules, organic compounds with traditional drug properties (e.g., Lipinski's rule of five) that can bind to RNA secondary or tertiary structures and alter translation patterns, localization, and degradation.
Origins.
Recent discoveries implicating RNA in the pathogenesis of several forms of cancer and neuromuscular diseases have created a paradigm shift in drug discovery. This work combined with advances in structural characterization techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography together with computational modeling, has pushed forward the realization that RNA is a dynamic yet viable drug target. Traditionally, RNA was thought to be a mediator between DNA sequence-encoded instructions and functional protein. However, recent reports have shown that there are a large number of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that are not translated into protein. Whereas 85% of the human genome is transcribed into RNA only 3% of the transcripts code for functional protein. Although, ncRNAs do affect gene expression levels by a variety of mechanisms. Further, RNA can adopt discrete secondary or tertiary structures which play a pivotal role in many biological processes and disease pathology. For these reasons, RNA is being recognized as an attractive drug target for small molecules.
The earliest attempts to target RNA led to the discovery that aminoglycosides could bind to human RNA. In an early report, Noller discovered that several classes of antibiotics (streptomycin, tetracycline, spectinomycin, edeine, hygromycin, and the neomycins) could "protect" nucleotides in 16S ribosomal RNA by binding to this RNA. Subsequent studies by Schroeder and Green began to plant the seed that RNA could be targeted. Schroeder uncovered that aminoglycosides could inhibit protein synthesis by interacting with the ribosome through interactions with the 3’ end of the 16S RNA of "E. coli" taking advantage of RNA conformational changes. Green and coworkers further confirmed this idea, discovering that aminoglycosides blocked the interaction of HIV-1 Rev protein and its viral RNA-binding site.
David Wilson and David Draper were the first to suggest that RNA structures could be targeted by small molecules. They hypothesized that RNA could be "druggable" by targeting the 3D structure in the same way as protein 3D structures are used as drug targets and furthered the idea that targeting RNA could be used to treat diseases. Czanik and co-workers at Parke Davis completed a screen on HIV Tat. They found multiple small molecule inhibitors of the HIV-1 Tat—TAR system that recognized the bulge, lower stem, or loop region of the TAR RNA. One of the compounds discovered, 2,4,5,6-tetraaminoquinozaline, binds to the loop region of TAR, downregulates cellular Tat transactivation, and ultimately inhibits HIV-1 replication. 
The use of aminoglycosides, while an early start to RNA-targeting, came with some challenges. These molecules were only modestly selective and showed unfavorable toxicity levels at relevant therapeutic concentrations. As another strategy for targeting RNA, antisense oligonucleotides were developed which have been pushed forward through the clinic for several diseases. By this principle, if one can identify an RNA involved in disease then the sequence can be used to design a complementary antisense oligonucleotide, and that agent can be introduced into cells to treat the disease. But, this approach in its basic form has been met with several challenges. The most obvious are their large size and propensity to degradation by nucleases. In order for cellular RNA to be effective it must enter the cells intact. While backbone modifications to antisense oligonucleotides in order to prevent nuclease degradation have been shown to work, this approach is still somewhat limited. Small molecules may present a better way to target RNA and subsequently DNA because they can be designed to be more "drug-like" and have a better chance of reaching their target, most by oral administration. For this reason, there is an emerging interest in designing and discovering small molecules to target RNA secondary and tertiary structures to ultimately treat new diseases.
Human treatment.
There are limited examples of small molecules that target RNA and are approved drugs for the treatment of human disease. Ribavirin was approved in 2002 to treat Hepatitis C and viral hemorrhagic fever. As a nucleoside inhibitor, the guanosine analog prodrug is used to stop viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping by incorporating into RNA and pairing to uracil or cytosine. Branaplam is currently in phase I/II clinical trial for the treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA). This molecule is from a class of pyridazine small molecules and enhances the inclusion of exon 7, resulting in a full length and functional protein product.
Branaplam represents the first mechanistic study of splicing modulation using a sequence-selective small molecule. The drug stabilizes the transient double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) structure formed between the SMN2 pre-mRNA and U1 snRNP complex, a key component of the splicesome. Further, this compound acts by increasing the binding affinity of U1 snRNP to the 5’ splice site (5’ss) in a sequence-selective manner that is discrete from constitutive recognition. Ataluren is in clinical trials for the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). It is believed that Ataluren acts by promoting insertion of near-cognate tRNAs at the site of the nonsense codon without affecting transcription, mRNA processing, mRNA stability, or protein stability to give nonsense suppression. This drug would be effective for ~10% of patients with DMD who have a single mutation in the DMD gene causing a stop codon to appear prematurely (nonsense mutation).
Animal treatment.
Compared to the number of drug candidates that have successfully made it to the clinical trial phase, there are many more lead compounds which have been tested "in vivo" using various animal models. Much of the current work that has progressed to "in vivo" testing has been directed to the RNA repeat expansions implicated in genetic neuromuscular diseases. In myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), r(CUG)exp mRNAs sequester proteins including the alternative splicing regulator MBNL1 into the nucleus causing missplicing. Several groups have developed compounds which bind the toxic RNA and dissolve nuclear foci. In 2011, Artero and coworkers discovered that a peptide could reduce the toxicity associated with r(CUG) repeats in "Drosophila" and mouse models. Disney and colleagues provided the first small molecules that targeted r(CUG) repeats in animals models by using rational designing to identify many small molecules directly targeting this toxic RNA and the compounds improved disease defects in a DM1 mouse model.
Other works by the Disney group has shown that in cellular models of various RNA-mediated diseases that are causes by RNA repeats such as r(CAG) in Huntington's disease and r(CCUG) repeats in Myotonic Dystrophy Types 2 could also be targeted with small molecules. Nakamori and colleagues also reported in 2012 that erythromycin could be orally dosed in DM1 mouse models to restore missplicing defects and inhibit the complex formed between r(CUG) and MBNL1. In that same year, Miller and coworkers screened a library of compounds to find a small molecule drug that could improve splicing defects in a mouse model. The Zimmerman group has taken a rational design approach to discovering small molecule drugs that target r(CUG). One such compound contains a selective triaminotriazine recognition motif which binds to the UU mismatches in r(CUG) selectively most likely in a base triplet combined with an amidinium RNA groove binding unit. Studies using a "Drosophila" model for DM1 showed an influence on related phenotypic outcomes such as eye morphology and climbing distance.
Aside from studies involved r(CUG) repeats, other complex RNA structures have also been targeted. Pearson and coworkers discovered that a cationic porphyrin (TMPyP4) bound a G-quadruplex r(G4C2) and inhibited the binding of proteins to r(G4C2). Work by Disney and Petrucelli rationally identified small molecules that can target this repeat and affect disease biology in model cellular systems and also in patient-derive iNeurons. Further studies by Rothstein and colleagues determined that TMPyP4 could suppress r(G4C2)-mediated neurodegeneration in a "Drosophila" model. Additionally targets have been rationally identified by using a powerful seqecune-based design approach termed informal to identify dozens of bioactive small molecules that target disease causing non-coding RNA termed INFORNA. This study important showed for the first time that small molecules appear to have selectivities that are competitive with oligonucleotides with cell-permeable and medicinally optimizable small molecules. Additionally, compounds have been shown to be bioactive in diverse disease settings that ranged from breast cancer. and hepatocellular carcinoma. More recently, the Disney group further used their prediction database INFORNA to design Targaprimir-96 to target miRNA precursors in animal models of cancer, the first small molecules to do so. This compound has a nanomolar affinity for the miRNA hairpin precursor selectively over other sequences. Targaprimir-96 was further tested in cells and in mice, inhibiting tumor growth in a xenograft mouse model of triple negative breast cancer upon i.p. injection.
Cellular use.
RNA-targeting small molecule drug discovery has greatly benefitted from the available cellular models for disease. The use of cell culture in early development has become a requirement for assessing the basic efficacy of a drug candidate. Thus, more research groups have implemented these techniques in their programs. In a leading example, Al-Hashimi and coworkers identified six small molecules with high affinity for TAR of HIV-1 through a computational approach. They docked a library of small molecules onto RNA dynamic structures generated by NMR and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. The hit molecules inhibited the Tat—TAR interaction "in vitro". They arrived at lead molecule, netilmicin, that had the best selectivity for HIV-1 TAR and inhibited HIV-1 replication in cells with a low IC50. The Disney group has studied aminoglycoside derivatives in 2009 for their ability to inhibit interactions between repeat RNA and proteins. Using their prediction database INFORNA, they discovered that a compound could bind to 1 x 1 UU internal loops on an N-methyl peptide backbone. They confirmed that like other compounds that target DM1 r(CUG), they could inhibit the complex between r(CUG)-MBNL1, disrupt nuclear foci, and increase nucleocytoplasmic transport of the gene in patient-derived DM1 fibroblasts. In that study the Disney group also described several approaches to validate the RNA targets of small molecules. In the first approach termed chemical cross-linking and isolation by pull down (Chem-CLIP) and chemical cross-linking and isolation by pull down to map binding sites (Chem-CLIP-Map).
These studies showed in cells that small molecules can direct target disease-causing r(CUG) repeats in DM1 and that impressively the compound can discriminate against other RNAs with shorter repeats and also between the mutant and wild type allele of the DMPK mRNA that contains r(CUG) disease-causing repeats. In an additional approach, dubbed small–molecule nucleic acid profiling by cleavage applied to RNA (Ribo-SNAP) showed that small molecules can be used to cleave RNA targets in cells and also importantly demonstrated that designer small molecules target precisely disease causing RNA repeats and discriminate against RNAs that are not disease causing but have short repeats of r(CUG). Thus, targeting RNA structure with small molecules can have important selectively discrimination implications in cells.
In 2014, Chenowith and colleagues reported a cationic triptycene scaffold that targets RNA and DNA three-way junctions. Subsequent studies showed that these molecules exhibited favorable cellular uptake and cytotoxicity in human ovarian cancer cell lines. In 2017, the Xodo group reported anthrafurandione and anthrathiophenedione small molecules with aminoethyl side chains could bind to RNA G-quadraplexes at the 5’-UTR of certain mRNAs. Further, these compounds were shown to suppress the KRAS oncogene in pancreatic cancer cells and induce apoptosis by reducing the metabolic activity of the cells.
In vitro.
In 2009, the Zimmerman group discovered a compound to target the trinucleotide repeat expanded RNA and DNA that cause DM1. Through rational design, they utilized a triaminotriazine recognition unit to target TT or UU mismatches through a Janus Wedge type binding mode, creating a base triplet with the mismatch. The combined use of an acridine intercalator to pi-pi stack on the target gave a nanomolar binding affinity for TT or UU mismatches over others. Along with high binding affinity, this molecule was shown to displace MBNL from the complex with r(CUG) with a micromolar Ki. Additionally, HIV-1 RNA has been targeted extensively "in vitro" by RNA-binding small molecules. In 2007, Miller and coworkers used dynamic combinatorial chemistry to screen a compound library against HIV-1 frameshift regulatory stem-loop RNA. They identified a hit compound that was selective for the regulatory sequence with micromolar binding affinity.
In 2011, Butcher and colleagues discovered a frameshifting stimulator (DB213) which bound to HIV-1 FS RNA with moderate binding affinity. An NMR structure of the RNA in complex with DB213, showed that the small molecule bound to the major groove of the RNA duplex. Schneekloth and Hargrove have taken a different approach by targeting the HIV-1 TAR RNA hairpin. In a small molecule microarray screening, the Schneekloth group identified a thienopyridine derivative that interacts with HIV-1 TAR RNA hairpin. Further SAR studies provided more information on the structure and binding mode. The lead analogue was found to bind to the 5’-UTR of HIV with an IC50 of 40 μM for displacing a Tat-derived peptide. The Hargrove group developed a small library of amiloride derivatives with changes at the C(5) and C(6) positions to improve the binding affinity of amiloride to the loop and bulge of the HIV-1 TAR RNA. Using "in vitro" studies and modeling, they found a hit compound whose inhibition activity was increased by more than 100x compared to the parent amiloride. This compound is reported to be one of the tightest non-aminoglycoside TAR ligands reported to date.

Finnish tribes

Finnish tribes (Finnish: "Heimot") are ancient ethnic groups from which over time Finns evolved.
In 1548 in his New Testament Mikael Agricola mentions that Finnish tribes are Finns, Tavastians and Karelians. The same division can also be seen in typical brooches that women wore in the 12th to 14th centuries. However, the metal culture, especially jewelry and weapons, had already evolved into distinctive and peculiar in the end of the Merovingian period in the 8th century in the area of contemporary Finland. The intention of this evolution was possibly to express specifically "Finnish" identity which was born from the image of common origin and mutual similarity.
Finnish tribes are frequently mentioned in historical sources, such as papal letters, Novgorod First Chronicle and Eric Chronicles.

Copa Federación de España (Basque tournament)

The Basque Country tournament is an annual football competition held in Spain which serves as the preliminary round of the " Copa Federación de España (Copa RFEF)" in the Basque Country ("Euskadi") region. Organised by the Basque Football Federation, the participating clubs in the tournament are drawn from the Tercera División (Group 4), as well as local clubs in the Segunda División B who have not qualified for the season's Copa del Rey, including reserve teams and farm teams. Not all teams eligible take part each year.
As the Copa RFEF is for lower division clubs, the top sides in the region such as Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad have never entered the main competition or the qualifying phase. However, Deportivo Alavés have taken part in the national phase, and their B-team won the Basque tournament three years in a row from 2015.
Format.
The regional tournament is usually played between July and October, the format depends on the number of registered teams, and the winner receives a €3,000 prize. 
The champion qualifies to the National phase of the Copa RFEF. At that point, losing teams from the first round of the Copa del Rey, usually including at least one Basque club, are also invited to the Copa RFEF, but often they decline to participate in order to concentrate on the league.
The opening nationwide rounds pair entrants from either the same autonomous community or one nearby (such as Navarre or Cantabria), so it is common for the Basque teams to eliminate each other.
History.
The most successful Basque qualifier to the national phase was Real Unión, who won the entire competition in 2015, defeating CD Castellón 4–0 on aggregate.
SD Lemona were finalists in 2011 and 2012, with the latter event producing a dramatic outcome: having lost the first leg away to CD Binissalem by a 5–0 score, Lemona turned the tie on its head at home, winning 6–1. They lost on away goals, being unable to add to their tally in the last 15 minutes of the match. Within a few months of the final, the club had dissolved due to financial problems. Lemona also have the best overall record in the qualifying tournament, winning five times in 16 years.
Champions.
Editions with only one team registered not included in this ranking.
Previous competitions.
From 1930 until 1987, Biscay and Gipuzkoa operated separate provincial competitions for their non-professional clubs, with the winners of each qualifying for the national "", the predecessor to the "Copa Federación". The most successful team in Biscay was Erandio with 13 wins, far ahead of Indautxu on 6, while in Gipuzkoa Real Unión, CD Logroñés and won four titles apiece.

Vashon Ranger R7

The Vashon Ranger R7 is an American light-sport aircraft designed and produced by Vashon Aircraft of Woodinville, Washington. It was formally introduced at the AirVenture airshow in Oshkosh, Wisconsin in July 2018. The aircraft is supplied complete ready-to-fly-aircraft.
Design and development.
The development of the Ranger R7 started in about 2013. By February 2018 two prototypes were flying and four production aircraft were under construction, for April 2018 delivery.
The aircraft is an all-metal monocoque design and features a cantilever high-wing, a two-seats-in-side-by-side configuration enclosed cabin, accessed by doors, fixed tricycle landing gear, with a castering nosewheel and a single engine in tractor configuration. The aircraft is made from pre-painted sheet 6061-T6 aluminum to save construction time. The seats fold flat to allow sleeping in the cabin when camping.
The company manufactures the majority of parts itself to reduce costs and shorten the supply chain.
By January 2018 the design had been accepted by the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as a light-sport aircraft.
Operational history.
By May 2017, one example had been registered in the United States with the FAA.
In a review of the design on AVweb, writer Paul Bertorelli indicated that the aircraft suffers from a low useful load of , due to the choice of the old-technology Continental O-200D engine, which is at least heavier than other newer engines.

Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum

The FHXB Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum is a local history museum focusing on the borough of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg in Berlin, Germany. It contains a historical archive related to both parts of the district, permanent exhibits on urban development and social and immigration history, temporary exhibits on the district's past and present, and a historic printing press. The museum is part of the Culture and History Department within the district administration of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, and is located at Adalbertstrasse 95a in Kreuzberg.
History.
The Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum is an amalgamation of the Kreuzberg Museum and the Heimatmuseum Friedrichshain.
The "Verein zur Erforschung und Darstellung der Geschichte Kreuzbergs e.V." (Association to Research and Convey the History of Kreuzberg) was founded in 1978, laying the groundwork for the "Kreuzberg Museum für Stadtentwicklung und Sozialgeschichte" (Kreuzberg Museum for Urban Development and Social History). In connection with West Berlin's 750th anniversary celebrations in 1987, Kreuzberg received funds earmarked for a permanent position to head a neighborhood museum. Krista Tebbe, head of the Kreuzberg Arts Office, named Martin Düspohl as founding director of the museum-to-be. Düspohl was a co-founder of "StattReisen Berlin e.V." and had participated in various projects with the "Berliner Geschichtswerkstatt" (Berlin History Workshop). The Kreuzberg Museum opened in 1991. With it, Düspohl and Tebbe aimed to take the idea of "Heimatmuseum" in a new direction: to draw connections between local everyday history and larger historical events; to democratize the writing of history by inviting local residents to participate; and to “dig where you’re standing” ("Grabe, wo du stehst") – to look for history in unexpected, everyday places. Many of these impulses drew on the work of the "Berliner Geschichtswerkstatt" and other grassroots history initiatives.
The "Heimatmuseum Friedrichshain" was founded in the late 1980s as part of the Friedrichshain Arts Office. Until 2004 it was located in the “alte Feuerwache” at Marchlewskistrasse 6 in Friedrichshain.
Following Berlin's reunification and the 2001 reform of administrative districts, which fused Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg into one borough, the city decided to consolidate the two neighborhood museums. In 2004 the "Heimatmuseum Friedrichshain" was closed and its collection integrated into the Kreuzberg Museum, now under the new name "Bezirksmuseum Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg" (Borough Museum of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg). On April 12, 2013, the institution was renamed FHXB Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg Museum.
Martin Düspohl headed the museum from its founding until February 2017, when he left to join the curatorial team of the Berlin Exhibit in the Humboldt Forum. The immigration scholar Natalie Bayer became museum director in January 2018.
Building.
Since its opening in 1991, the Kreuzberg Museum has occupied a former factory building on Adalbertstrasse. The five-story brick building was constructed in the early 1920s on the lot of a residential building, and was originally used to produce furniture (by the firm Reinicke &amp; Fähnrich) and wire fencing (by the firm Ritzmann, owned by Wildenhayn). The wire fencing factory existed until the end of the Second World War and was run by the wife of the owner.
Before it became a museum, the building underwent extensive renovations and modernization. The empty lots where residential buildings had stood until 1970 were transformed into a garden. A glass stairwell with an elevator was constructed as the new building entrance, making the museum accessible to people with physical disabilities.
Permanent exhibitions.
"Geschichte wird gemacht! Abriss und Aufbruch am Kottbusser Tor 1945–2015" (Making History! Demolition and Protest at Kottbusser Tor 1945–2015), concentrates on protest movements and urban redevelopment in SO36. The area around the Kottbusser Tor, named after a former postal district (Southeast 36), was the focus of urban renewal for over 40 years until 2003. The often dilapidated Gründerzeit buildings were set to be demolished and replaced by residential high-rises in accordance with the motto, “Air, light, sun!” In this vein, city planners succeeded in redeveloping Kottbusser Tor by tearing down the surrounding buildings, changing the flow of traffic, and constructing the massive New Kreuzberg Center residential and commercial complex. In the 1970s and 1980s, partially in response to the New Kreuzberg Center, the alternative movement initiated broad protests against this form of urban renewal through demonstrations and widespread squatting, with eventual success.
The original version of this exhibit, which opened in 2001, was created in cooperation with about 60 Kreuzberg residents and was based in part on their memories and perspectives. In 2015 the FHXB Museum undertook a renewal of the exhibit to include the period from 2001 to 2015, with a focus on Kreuzberg's drastic gentrification. The new version also sought to place greater emphasis on the establishment of immigrant, particularly Turkish, communities in Kreuzberg as guest workers settled in the neighborhood from the 1960s onward.
In January 2012, the FHXB Museum opened "Ortsgespräche. stadt – migration – geschichte" (Local Chats. City – Migration – History) on the second and third floors. This exhibit focuses on the history of concrete, everyday locations in the borough as intersecting spaces of migration. Migration is understood here as an integral part of the history of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. Visitors are invited to record their own stories in the museum's recording studio and thereby expand the content of the exhibit. "Ortsgespräche" was curated by Lorraine Bluche and Frauke Miera in collaboration with countless residents of Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg. In early 2017 the FHXB Museum disassembled the second floor of the exhibit to make room for special exhibitions. The content has been integrated into the third floor as the virtual tour “Ortsgeschichten” (Local Histories).
Past temporary exhibitions.
The museum's exhibitions on regional history have often focused on immigration and its importance for Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg.
The groundbreaking exhibit "Wir waren die Ersten ... Türkiye‘den Berlin‘e" (We Were the First ... From Turkey to Berlin, on view 2000 to 2002) used interviews to explore the lives and perspectives of Kreuzbergers who arrived in Berlin as guest workers in the mid-1960s. Kreuzberg SO 36 had and still has the highest concentration of Turkish immigrants in the city. Beginning with this exhibit, the guest worker agreements and their implications for the labor structures and demographics of Kreuzberg assumed a prominent place in the museum's examination of local history. In addition, the networks established through the exhibit became an integral resource for the institution. Most recently the exhibit "Alman Geschichteler – Gastarbaijteri erzählen" (2016–17) by the Gegennarrativ collective delved into the ambivalence of guest workers’ experiences in Kreuzberg through in-depth interviews.
"Ein jeder nach seiner Façon. 300 Jahre Zuwanderung nach Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg" (To Each His Own: 300 Years of Immigration to Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg, on view 2005 to 2010) documented how poverty, war and persecution forced people to leave their home countries to start new lives in Berlin, from the Huguenot and Bohemian religious refugees in the 18th century to asylum seekers in the 21st century. Particular emphasis was placed on forced deportation, flight, and expulsion during and because of the Second World War, as well as labor migration from Turkey to Kreuzberg and from Vietnam to Friedrichshain during the second half of the 20th century.
More recently, "Letters of Stone" (June to November 2017) examined the fate of a Kreuzberg Jewish family, the Robinskis, during the Nazi period. While some family members were able to emigrate to South Africa, others remained in Berlin and corresponded about their increasingly dire situation through written letters, which formed the basis of the exhibit.
From November 2017 to January 2018 the museum showed "Andere Heimaten: Herkunft und Migrationsrouten von Drogenverkäufern in Berliner Parks" (Other Homelands: Origins and Migration Routes of Berlin Park Drug Sellers), developed by the artist Scott Holmquist at the museum's invitation. For the exhibit Holmquist interviewed people selling drugs in Görlitzer Park and Hasenheide about the specific cities, towns and villages they came from, as well as the stations of their journey to Berlin. He did not pose questions about their motivations, feelings, or current occupations. The exhibit consisted of 13 descriptions of these origin locations, each in the native language of the respective interviewee, juxtaposed with an extensive collection of media depictions of park drug sellers. Using a travel portal created for the exhibit, visitors could plan reverse journeys from Berlin to the highlighted places. Members of the CDU tried to officially shut down the exhibition shortly before its opening. The project received a great deal of national and international media attention and brought the museum an extraordinary rush of visitors.
Archive.
The FHXB Museum's local historical archive contains photos, documents, files, and objects, and provides support and consultation for scholars, teachers and students, history workshops, and lay researchers.
In three projects funded by the European Union and the Berlin Senate, the archive was able to digitize its most important collections and publish a large portion of them online. These are: documents, posters, and flyers related to urban renewal and social movements in Kreuzberg, 1970–1990; 25,000 negative photos by Jürgen Henschel of “Leftist Berlin,” 1959–1991; interviews with contemporary witnesses on their immigration to Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg; works by the artists’ group Kreuzberg Boheme; a collection of scrapbooks from the Heimatmuseum Friedrichshain; and documentation of the exhibit "Juden in Kreuzberg" (Jews in Kreuzberg, on view 1991).
The museum archive also includes negatives from the Mathesie photo studio at Adalbertstr. 11, which closed its doors in 1993 after nearly 50 years. A selection of these studio portraits, which provide a cross-section of Kreuzberg society, was published in the book "Jetzt Lächeln! Atelierfotografie am Beispiel Mathesie – Eine Enzyklopädie" and shown in a corresponding exhibit.
Further offerings.
On the ground floor of the five-story building is a historic typesetting room and printing shop, which are used for children's workshops
and adult education courses.
The museum offers walking tours of the neighborhood through the “X-Berg-Tag” program, conceived of and led by young people from Kreuzberg to counteract the common media portrayal of the area as dangerous and problem-riddled. The tour guides highlight their individual experiences and perspectives, particularly through locations that hold special importance for the Turkish or Arab communities.

The Fourth Paradigm

The Fourth Paradigm: Data-intensive Scientific Discovery is a 2009 anthology of essays on the topic of data science. Editors Tony Hey, Kristin Michele Tolle, and Stewart Tansley claim in the book's description that it presents the first broad look at the way that increasing use of data is bringing a paradigm shift to the nature of science.
Response.
A review in The New York Times starts by explaining that the fourth paradigm is data science, and that paradigms one to three are, in order, empirical evidence, scientific theory, and computational science.
A commentator who agreed with the premise that data would change science questioned the history of this development, suggesting that computer scientists would have to develop better user interfaces to facilitate scientific discovery. 
A commentator specializing in discussions about R claimed that as R and similar tools adapt to handle more data more easily the changes which the book describes will manifest more thoroughly.
A researcher credited the book as inspiration for examining the color of snow.

Ohio v. American Express Co.

Ohio v. American Express Co., 585 U.S. ___ (2018), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the nature of antitrust law in relationship to two-sided markets. The case specifically involves policies set by some credit card banks that prevented merchants from steering customers to use cards from other issuers with lower transaction fees, forcing merchants to pay higher transaction fees to the banks. While Visa and MasterCard settled with the United States Department of Justice in 2010, American Express defended its practice by arguing that the anti-steering policies benefited its cardholders, the higher transaction fees helping to maintain member services. While the Department of Justice and several states prevailed during a District Court trial in 2015 citing harm to the merchants, the Appeals Court reversed the District Court's ruling in 2016 by ruling that the plaintiffs had not shown harm to both sides of the two-side market, a novel test in antitrust law. This decision led to some of the states to appeal to the Supreme Court. The case was heard by the Court in February 2018.
The Court issued its decision on June 25, 2018, affirming the Appeals Court's ruling that steering provisions do not violate antitrust laws. With this decision upheld, the two-market test could be applied to other venues, particularly to the high tech sector where two-side markets are common.
Background.
Within the United States, credit card transactions are controlled by four main financial institutions: Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover, making it an oligopoly. Credit cards work as a two-sided market, with the institutions providing benefits to consumers (by allowing them to access lines of credit to make instant purchases) and merchants (by providing them the funds for that purchase instantly). The institutions support this by taking a transaction fee off the merchant's funds, with the fee varying between each institution.
Of the four institutions, Discover was the latest offering, created in 1985. To try to compete with the other three institutions on the market, Discover developed a low-cost transaction fee model compared to the other three institutions, which gave incentive for merchants to steer customers towards using Discover cards. To counter this, Visa, MasterCard, and American Express all developed anti-steering contractual language to merchants that prevented them from steering customers into using other cards; this included informing their customers of the different fees and offering discounts and other incentives by using other cards. This also affected the promotion of other cards offered within the institution's network, such as using debit cards with lower fees compared to credit cards.
District Court.
In October 2010, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), after receiving numerous complaints that the anti-steering language violating antitrust laws and following two years of investigation, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Visa, MasterCard, and American Express in United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The DOJ asserted that with in transaction fees each year, the practices of these three institutions prevented merchants from reducing their own costs of business, and requiring them to raise prices to consumers. The DOJ's suit was joined by the states of Connecticut, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Texas. Visa and MasterCard immediately settled with the DOJ without any fines, agreeing to remove the anti-steering language imposed on merchants. However, American Express defended its practice, and continued to fight the lawsuit. During the pre-trial period, additional states also joined the other plaintiffs, including Arizona, Idaho, Illinois, New Hampshire, Montana, Nebraska, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, and Utah; Hawaii had also joined but later dismissed its claims before the trial.
In February 2015, following a seven-week trial hearing, the District Court ruled in favor of the DOJ and states, finding that American Express's anti-steering terms violated antitrust laws. Judge Nicholas Garaufis wrote that the language was "an unlawful restraint on trade" and considered the language to violate Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. American Express asserted that it would appeal the decision. Garaufis issued a permanent injunction on American Express from enforcing its anti-steering language in April 2015.
Appeals Court.
American Express's appeal was heard in the 2nd Circuit Appeals Court in December 2015. After the oral testimony, the Appeals Court lifted the injunction placed by Judge Garaufis. The full ruling of the Appeals Court in September 2016 reversed the lower court ruling; the Appeals Court argued that the plaintiffs had not shown harm that American Express's anti-steering had to merchants or consumers, and that the government would have been required to show how higher prices to merchants set by the transaction fees would harm consumer or not benefit them. The Appeals Court also argued that merchants overburdened by high transaction fees could simply cease accepting that card. This decision was considered to have created a new type of rule that could make it difficult to seek antitrust litigation; with credit cards being a two-sided market serving two distinct sets of customers, a successful antitrust argument would have to show how both sides of the market were harmed.
The DOJ petitioned the Appeals Court to reconsider the case at an "en banc" hearing, believing that their decision looked at both merchants and consumers, instead of focusing only on the impact to merchants alone, and that the onus should be for American Express to show how its anti-steering clauses would promote competition. The Appeals Court refused to reconsider its decision by January 2017.
Supreme Court.
While the Department of Justice and other states dropped the suit, eleven states continued to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States and filed petition to hear the case in June 2017; Ohio (leading the petition for appeal), Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont. The States' appeal raised questions of the Second Circuit's decision in conflict with past case law, and that Supreme Court guidance was needed on how antitrust measures should be applied a two-sided market, which was becoming a significant portion of the national economy. The Supreme Court accepted the case in October 2017.
Oral arguments were heard on February 26, 2018; court observers reported that both sides were equally asked tough questions, and it was difficult to determine which direction the Court would take. Questions asked in the oral session were principally from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch.
The Court issued its 5-4 decision on June 25, 2018, affirming the Appeals Court's ruling, and that the American Express steering provisions did not violate antitrust law. The majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas and joined by Justices Roberts, Kennedy, Alito, and Gorsuch, found that the petitioners had not shown any harm of the steering provisions that otherwise would not have occurred if no steering provisions were in place, nor have the provisions stifled competition in the market. Justice Stephen Breyer wrote the dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, taking issue with how the rule of reason had been applied for this case throughout its judicial history.

London South Africa RFC

London South Africa Rugby Football Club was an English rugby union club based initially in Wimbledon, London before moving to Surrey. They were founded in 2005 as a rugby club for South African expatriates in England. They were dissolved in 2014.
History.
London South Africa was originally envisioned by Jason Smith, a South African sports agent, shortly after the Kolpak ruling. He had representations from ten South Africa national rugby union team players to establish a club in England for the South African expatriate community. There had previously been a South African expatriate team in England called London Springboks RFC who were founded in 1996 but merged with nearby Sudbury RFC three years later.
Smith's initial plan was to purchase a National League 1 club, rename the club, relocate them to London and earn their way to promotion to the English Premiership. Eventually such a move failed so Smith moved lower down the divisions and started discussions with Wimbledon RFC to purchase the club and take over their position in London 2 South in 2004. However, in light of Smith's publicised plans and a rival operation called London Tribes RFC planning a similar move, Wimbledon rejected the offer and the Rugby Football Union also prohibited the attempt. As such, London South Africa were formed as a new club and made an application to join the Surrey Rugby Football Union. Their application was successful and they started playing in the bottom tier of English rugby. They initially started playing in Wimbledon but moved to Imber Court in Esher, Surrey.
The club's name was challenged in court by a man who claimed he owned the trademark to the London South Africa name since 2000. However the claim was denied as there was no evidence of him using the name for a rugby club beyond occasional scratch teams of South Africans for rugby sevens and rugby tens competitions. During their first three years of existence, they won three consecutive promotions. In 2009, they sent a team to the international beach rugby championships, finishing fifth. Despite early success, the club folded in 2014.

CUT&amp;RUN sequencing

CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing, also known as cleavage under targets and release using nuclease, is a method used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing combines antibody-targeted controlled cleavage by micrococcal nuclease with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global DNA binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Currently, ChIP-Seq is the most common technique utilized to study protein–DNA relations, however, it suffers from a number of practical and economical limitations that CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing does not.
Uses.
CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing can be used to examine gene regulation or to analyze transcription factor and other chromatin-associated protein binding. Protein-DNA interactions regulate gene expression and are responsible for many biological processes and disease states. This epigenetic information is complementary to genotype and expression analysis. CUT&amp;RUN is an alternative to the current standard of ChIP-seq. ChIP-Seq suffers from limitations due to the cross linking step in ChIP-Seq protocols that can promote epitope masking and generate false-positive binding sites. As well, ChIP-seq suffers from suboptimal signal-to-noise ratios and poor resolution. CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing has the advantage of being a simpler technique with lower costs due to the high signal-to-noise ratio, requiring less depth in sequencing.
Specific DNA sites in direct physical interaction with proteins such as transcription factors can be isolated by Protein-A (pA) conjugated micrococcal nuclease (MNase) bound to a protein of interest. MNase mediated cleavage produces a library of target DNA sites bound to a protein of interest "in situ". Sequencing of prepared DNA libraries and comparison to whole-genome sequence databases allows researchers to analyze the interactions between target proteins and DNA, as well as differences in epigenetic chromatin modifications. Therefore, the CUT&amp;RUN method may be applied to proteins and modifications, including transcription factors, polymerases, structural proteins, protein modifications, and DNA modifications.
Workflow.
CUT&amp;RUN is an adaptation and improvement on chromatin endogenous cleavage (ChEC) which uses a DNA-binding protein genetically fused to micrococcal nuclease (MNase). These transcription factor-MNase fusion proteins can cleave DNA around the DNA-binding site of the protein of interest. In the adapted process, purified MNase is tagged with Protein A (pA) which targets an antibody that has been added to the cell and is specific for the DNA-binding protein that is of interest. There are seven general steps to the CUT&amp;RUN process.
Cleavage under targets and release using nuclease.
The first step required is the hypotonic lysis of the cells of interest to isolate the nuclei. The nuclei are then centrifuged, washed in a buffer solution, complexed with lectin-coated magnetic beads. The Lectin-Nuclei complex is then resuspended with an antibody targeted at the protein of interest. The antibody and nuclei are then incubated in the buffer for approximately 2 hours before the nuclei are washed in buffer to remove unbound antibodies. Next, the nuclei are resuspended in the buffer with Protein-A-MNase and are incubated for 1 hour. The nuclei are then again washed in buffer to remove any unbound protein-A-MNase. Next, the nuclei in tubes are placed in a metal block and placed in ice-water and CaCL2 is added to initiate the calcium dependent nuclease activity of MNase to cleave the DNA around the DNA-binding protein. The protein-A-MNase reaction is quenched by adding chelating agents (EDTA and EGTA). The cleaved DNA fragments are then liberated into the supernatant by incubating the nuclei for an hour before the nuclei is pelleted by centrifugation. The DNA fragments are then extracted from the supernatant and can be used to construct a sequencing library.
Sequencing.
Unlike ChIP-Seq there is no size selection required before sequencing. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, due to the low background achieved by performing the reaction "in situ" with the CUT&amp;RUN-sequencing methodology. ChIP-Seq, by contrast, requires ten times the sequencing depth because of the intrinsically high background associated with the method. The data is then collected and analyzed using software that aligns sample sequences to a known genomic sequence to identify the CUT&amp;RUN DNA fragments.
Protocols.
There are detailed CUT&amp;RUN workflows available in an open-access methods repository. 
Sensitivity.
CUT&amp;RUN-Sequencing provides low levels of background signal because of "in situ" profiling which retains "in vivo" 3D confirmations of transcription factor-DNA interactions, so antibodies access only exposed surfaces. Sensitivity of sequencing depends on the depth of the sequencing run (i.e. the number of mapped sequence tags), the size of the genome and the distribution of the target factor. The sequencing depth is directly correlated with cost and negatively correlated with background. Therefore, low-background CUT&amp;RUN sequencing is inherently more cost-effective than high-background ChIP-Sequencing.
Current research.
There have already been a number of research projects that have made use of the new CUT&amp;RUN technology.
In humans, researchers looking at fetal globin gene promoters have used CUT&amp;RUN to investigate the involvement of the protein BCL11A in mediating the function of the HBBP1 gene region, highlighting a potential target for therapeutic genome editing for hemoglobinopathies.
A research group has used CUT&amp;RUN to identify intermediates involved in nucleosome disruption during DNA transcription, validating a general strategy for structural epigenomics.
In humans and in African green monkeys, researchers using CUT&amp;RUN determined that the CENP-B protein (an important protein in centromere formation) and binding sites are specific to great ape centromeres, addressing the paradox that CENP-B, which is required for artificial centromere function, is non-essential.
Computational analysis.
As with many high-throughput sequencing approaches, CUT&amp;RUN-seq generates extremely large data sets, for which appropriate computational analysis methods are required. To predict DNA-binding sites from CUT&amp;RUN-seq read count data, peak calling methods have been developed.
Peak calling is a process where an algorithm is used to predict the regions of the genome that a transcription factor binds to by finding regions of the genome that have many mapped reads from a ChIP-seq or CUT&amp;RUN-seq experiment. MACS is a particularly popular peak calling algorithm for ChIP-seq data. SEACR is a highly selective peak caller that definitively validates the accuracy of CUT&amp;RUN for datasets with known true negatives.
To identify the causal DNA-binding motif for CUT&amp;RUN-seq peak calls one can apply the MEME motif-finding program to the CUT&amp;RUN sequences. This involves using a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) along with the Motif Alignment and Search Tool (MAST) to identify motifs in a reference genome that match the acquired sequence reads. This process allows the identification of the transcription-factor binding motif, or if the binding motif was previously known, this process can act to confirm the success of the experiment
Limitations.
The primary limitation of CUT&amp;RUN-seq is the likelihood of over-digestion of DNA due to inappropriate timing of the Calcium-dependent MNase reaction. A similar limitation exists for contemporary ChIP-Seq protocols where enzymatic or sonicated DNA shearing must be optimized. As with ChIP-Seq, a good quality antibody targeting the protein of interest is required.
