Ramco Point Conservation Park

 
Ramco Point Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Sunlands about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north-west of the municipal seat of Waikerie.
The conservation park consists of crown land described as “Allotment 4 of DP 66666” in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Waikerie. It came into existence on 22 June 2006 by proclamation under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". It is located at the east end of Sunlands between Ramco Road in the west and the bank of the River Murray in the east. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
The name which was approved on 20 October 2005 is derived from a geographical feature called "Ramco Point" which is located close to the conservation park. One of the other suggested names was the "Emil Lochart Conservation Park" which was proposed by the District Council of Loxton Waikerie. The name "Ramco" is of aboriginal origin and is reported in the papers of Norman Tindale, the anthropologist, as being derived from "bokarampko", the Aboriginal name for Ramco Lagoon which is located immediately south of the conservation park in the locality of Ramco.
The land within the conservation park was part of a forest reserve known as the "Waikerie Forest Reserve" which was proclaimed under the "Forestry Act 1950" and which existed from 19 March 1992 until 25 November 2004.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Djarimirri

Djarimirri (subtitled "Child of the Rainbow") is the first posthumous album and fourth studio album from Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu. The album was completed just weeks before his passing in July 2017 and presents traditional songs and harmonised chants from his traditional Yolngu life with orchestral arrangements. The album was released on 13 April 2018 and debuted at number one on the ARIA Charts, becoming Yunupingu's first number-one album. It is also the first time an Australian indigenous language album has peaked at number one, and he is only the second Aboriginal artist to have a number-one album, following Jessica Mauboy's "" in October 2016.
Skinnyfish Music producer Michael Hohnen said, "It's such an unlikely record to go number one. No beats, no programming, no pop formulas. It's just kind of like the opposite of what you would expect but it's an incredibly honest record and something that we've spent so long making and been really passionate about,"
At the ARIA Music Awards of 2018, "Djarimirri" was nominated for seven awards, winning four: Best Male Artist, Best Independent Release, Best World Music Album and Best Cover Art.
At the National Indigenous Music Awards of 2018, "Djarimirri" won Album of the Year and the title track won Song of the Year.
At the 2019 Australian Independent Awards, "Djarimirri" won Best Independent Album or EP.
Background and release.
Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu is the highest-selling Indigenous musician of all time, having released three top-five albums since 2008. Long-time musical collaborator and friend Michael Hohnen said: "Last year, we sat and listened to these recordings over and over again, from beginning to end and piece by piece, pulling them apart and putting them back together until all elements shone. We had finished the incredible process, preparing to release it and then we lost him." He added: "He was immensely proud of what we achieved on this album and it is an emotional experience for all of us to present this final enormous chapter in his story with this musical statement."
Reception.
Zoë Radas from JB Hi-Fi's "Stack Magazine" described the album as "totally spellbinding", saying "Gurrumul's voice – renowned for its clarity and depth – soars solo and in dual harmonies alongside orchestral accompaniments (primarily deep strings, timpani, brass and mallet percussion) which mimic the way a didgeridoo's circular inflections comb through its drone of sound. The resulting rhythms, complex and conflicting, are always in orbit around the command of Gurrumul's voice."
Bruce Elder from "The Sydney Morning Herald" said the album is "a unique and hugely significant contribution to Australian music."
Guido Farnell from "The Music AU" gave the album 4.5 out of 5 said it "feels instantly classic and destined to become an iconic Aussie album", adding, "Such a fully formed and joyous album released posthumously makes for truly bittersweet listening".
Paul Barr from "Readings" called the album a "remarkable achievement" and described it as "A perfect fusion of traditional and modern, Gurrumul's unique voice evokes a contemplative mood in the listener and connects to Yolngu culture. The brilliant rhythmic arrangements are hypnotic and heighten the effect."

Pseudacteon

Pseudacteon is a genus of flies in the family Phoridae. There are over 70 described species of "Pseudacteon" fly. They are also known as ant-decapitating flies due to their parasitic larval stage. An egg is injected by the female fly into the shoulder joint of an ant worker. Soon after, the egg undergoes rapid inflation as it appears to absorb ant hemolymph. This first instar larva migrates into the ant head and consumes the jaw muscle and other tissues, leaving the mandibles hanging and preparing a future exit space. After about two weeks, the ant worker is termed a "zombie" because the fly larva has effectively taken control. The worker leaves the nest and dies in the leaf litter or in a crack in the soil. As it dies, the ant's head falls off, apparently because the fly larva releases an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant's head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, requiring a further two weeks before emerging through the ant's mouth.
In tropical, subtropical areas the flies are active all year round, but in temperate regions they are active during all months except the winter months. Several "Pseudacteon" species were deliberately introduced to the United States to combat via biological control the invasive fire ant species "Solenopsis invicta".

Johnny Tame

Uwe Reuß (born 3 March 1947, Friedberg/Hessen), known as Johnny Tame, is a German singer-songwriter and guitarist. He started his musical career in the early 1960s and gained remarkable national and international success as soloist as well as member of different bands. His longtime cooperation and partnership with famous German Rock singer Peter Maffay kept raising his popularity which he would campaign for social and humanitarian activities. He retired from music business in 1989.
Tame is married and living in Hamburg, Germany.
Musical career.
Tame started his musical career in the early 1960s yet under his common name, Uwe Reuß. He performed as bassist, guitarist and singer in different German bands such as The Rascals (not to be mixed up with US-American Pop-Band The Rascals), The Gigolos and The Delegates. In 1964 he decided to make a living as a professional and gained attention in numerous Galas und TV-Shows, also in foreign German-speaking countries. Since 1967 he carried on using a pseudonym, Johnny Tame, and reached his biggest international success with his song "Sand in my Shoes". Tame played numerous festivals and was German representative at the Maltese Song-Festival "OSCAR" in 1968 where he finished third. The same year he contributed as singer on two songs of a Perry Rhodan movie using the pseudonym "Sherman Space".
By entering the 1970s international Concert-, TV- and Radio-Shows in United States, Portugal, Belgium und Scandinavia increased. Tame formed the "Johnny Tame's Time Machine" in 1972 and was bassist and singer of the band "Bourbon Family". Moreover he played with the "Orpheus Band" of Schlagersinger Costa Cordalis until 1976. Though media- and stage-appearance got more and more, the crucial breakthrough wouldn't succeed.
Tame and Maffay.
Tame had a very successful collaboration starting in 1976 with famous German Rock Singer Peter Maffay. As duo "Tame &amp; Maffay" they produced two Country Rock albums. Moreover Tame more or less went to be a constant guest at Maffay's studio- and live-productions until 1985 what finally earned Tame the long awaited economic success. His overall album-sales gained multiple Gold-, Platinum- and Diamond-Certifications. After all his deep disinterest in financial matters led to a subsequent monetary disaster.
Lasting problems during live- and studio-work due to Alcohol and Hashish consume have been spread as the main reasons for breaking up the cooperation in 1984. Only years later the public – and even Tame himself – came to know, that he was suffering from Chronic fatigue syndrome. His last production took place in 1986. He quit playing music and sealed himself off from any kind of public appearance. In 1989 he left his residence on East Frisian Island Borkum only for receiving the award "Artist of the year in Niedersachsen", a small city event in Northeim and a five-day-open-air festival in Bremen – The Breminale.
Social commitment.
Tame already used his popularity in an early stage of his career in order to support social and humanitarian projects as well as ecology groups. He broached the issues of air pollution, forest dieback or the use of nuclear energy – sometimes radically – long before those problems where picked out as a central theme in Germany and elsewhere. He played concerts with Joan Baez for "Amnesty International" and "Humanitas" in the early 1980s, also at the "Concert for Afghanistan" in Hamburg. He constantly supported "Greenpeace" and the German groups and initiatives "Künstler für den Frieden", "AGA Aktionsgemeinschaft Artenschutz" and "Nicaragua-Foundation" of Dietmar Schönherr.
Discography.
Between 1965 und 1986 there has been a couple of musical publications with and by Johnny Tame, both in German and English language. 
Musical support usually was contributed by members of "Peter Maffay Band". The so far last release was a "Best of..." album produced by his long time friend and bandmate Frank Diez.

Sand skiing

Sand skiing (occasionally sand-skiing) is a sport and form of skiing in which the skier rides down a sand dune on skis, using ski poles, as done with other types of skiing, which is practised on either snow, dry ski slopes, or roller skis. It has origins mainly in Namibia, where boardsport sandboarding can also be practised. Henrik May, a German living in Namibia for some 10 years, set a Guinness World Record in speed sand-skiing on 6 June 2010. He reached a speed of 92.12 km/h. It is also widespread in Peru, where sandboarding is also present. Sand skiing equipment includes a pair of skis with a laminate base and wax that needs to be applied to reduce friction with sand.
In 2018, Fayoum University held a sand skiing event in Fayoum with students from around Egypt joining in on the fun.

Bankstown Reservoir

Bankstown Reservoir is a heritage-protected water tower and a local landmark situated in the suburb of Bankstown, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Located west of Sydney CBD, the reservoir is elevated and was built on reinforced concrete piers, which is one of the oldest of this type that is still in use. The reservoir features various decorative attributes, plastered by hand, which lack in other functional reservoirs. Established in 1920, the reservoir serves a large area of South-Western Sydney.
History.
In 1826, the reservoir was once a hanging site for bushrangers. Patrick Sullivan and James Moran, both members of Sullivan's gang, were hanged at the site on 18 October 1826 after creating a stir in the Bathurst district. The site on which the Reservoir sits may be connected with the earliest period of Bankstown's European settlement, transport routes, the bushrangers which traversed Liverpool Road and the appearance and carrying out of law and order in the district.
Construction.
Construction of Bankstown Reservoir began in October 1918. The reservoir was built to meliorate the pressure on Ashfield Reservoir and obviate pumping from Ryde. In November 1918, the cornerstone for the piers were unveiled in stiff clay to an unfaltering shale foundation, to an average depth of . The concrete for the reservoir was made on site, with the sandstone acquired from a quarry at Potts Hill.
Power was administered by a portable steam engine. The rendering was made by ornamental exterior plastering and waterproofing of the interior of tank by cement gun. Hand rendering began in February 1920. Extra adjustments to the reservoir include the aluminium roof built in 1962 to preserve water quality. It is likely that the concrete walkway was removed or covered by the roof.
At the time of its construction, Bankstown reservoir was the largest elevated reinforced concrete elevated reservoir in the country. After its completion, elevated reservoirs built in reinforced concrete became common until the 1950s, with one similar tower established in the 1930s in Padstow Heights.
Proposed developments.
In 2015, it was proposed by Bankstown City Council and Sydney Water for the tower to be ornamented with decorative lights from sunset to sunrise, akin to those displayed in Vivid Sydney. Bankstown councillor Naji Najjar's vision was to turn the tower into a tourist attraction that could rival Coffs Harbour's Big Banana and Goulburn's Big Merino, stating "I believe it is important that Bankstown City Council, together with Sydney Water, take the opportunity to promote this icon of our city". As part of Cr Najjar's plan, the area would also be embellished with fencing, landscaping and Australian native gardens, with interpretative signage, including a stone monument revealing the site's history. He concludes, "The lighting could have themes for various charity and community events and awareness campaigns". The council would eventually write to the State Government and await approval.
Design.
Bankstown reservoir is built of reinforced concrete and contains a circular water tank. Being akin to a rotunda, it is backed up by 36 strengthened concrete pillars and decorative arches which encircle the establishment. The inward columns are assembled of reinforced concrete while the outer ones consist of plain concrete. Construction aggregate was used for the concrete in the elevated tank and its columns and sandstone conglomeration for the bowed encirclement and ground foundations at the bottom. Instead of a handrail at the top, the reservoir has a concrete rectangular paneled parapet wall.
The tower's arches have a moulding and a circular pattern above each column, with the base of the tank having moulded apron with rectangular panels above. Furthermore, the structure was restrengthened to abide to the earthquake code in 2009. The design of Bankstown Reservoir exemplifies the Victorian and neoclassical architectural of the early 20th century. Its structure is mostly intact and has sustained minor alterations thus retaining its integrity. The reservoir has been roofed to safeguard water quality in the 1960s-1970s.
Features.
Bankstown Reservoir supplies drinking water to households as far west as Villawood and Condell Park in the southwest, Croydon in the east, and Auburn and North Strathfield in the north. It has a capacity of with its waters having a depth of . The reservoir has a foot bridge to a walkway on the top of the water tower, passing through the centre of the tank. The tower's rooftop, being above sea level, provides panoramic views of the Sydney skyline and Greater Western Sydney area. The reservoir is surrounded by brush box, coral tree, poplar and fig trees.
The reservoir is renowned for being the first concrete reservoir to be elevated on concrete piers. "Sydney Water Heritage Program" leader Phil Bennett stated the Bankstown reservoir has "the highest level of heritage protection because it is the oldest of the class of elevated reinforced concrete reservoirs". Mr Bennett concluded, “It’s quite decorative so it has aesthetic value and it sits very prominently on a hill top and it can be seen for miles, so it has landmark values”. The reservoir supplies drinking water to households in areas such as Villawood, Condell Park, Croydon, Auburn and North Strathfield.
Access.
The reservoir is situated on the corner of Hume Highway and Stacey Street in the northeastern periphery of Bankstown, bordering Greenacre. However though, the main entry to the water tower is from Beresford Avenue, which is a dead end street accessed from Hume Hwy.
Heritage register.
The reservoir was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register as a site of State significance on 18 November 1999 with the following citation:
"Bankstown Elevated Reservoir has a considerable level of state heritage significance as a representative example of a common reservoir design strongly favoured by Board engineers during the early period of the twentieth century. It is the oldest elevated reservoir constructed in reinforced concrete that is still in use. At the time of its construction it was the largest elevated reinforced concrete reservoir, and symbolised the technological advancements of the time. It displays decorative and formal architectural qualities and shows a high level of workmanship and technical accomplishment. It has several features which distinguish it from other elevated reservoirs of this type, including; the central concrete access tower; the concrete footbridge connecting the tower to the walkway and which encircles the perimeter of the top bank; and the mercury U-shaped tube depth gauge. It is currently still in active service and makes a positive contribution to the streetscape of Bankstown."

The Yanks at Oxford

The Yanks at Oxford: The 1987 Boat Race Controversy is a non-fiction book written by Allison Gill and published in 1991. The book is a commentary on "" by Dan Topolski and Patrick Robinson.
Subject.
Both books discuss the events surrounding the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race of 1987 in which an American contingent led by Chris Clark of the Oxford team mutinied and was replaced by a less experienced team. In "The Yanks at Oxford" Gill, who was president of the Oxford University Women's Boat Club at the time of the incident, attempts to defend the actions of the American contingent. Gill is of the opinion that Topolski wrote "True Blue" to justify his own actions and also says that she believes that the Americans were not there to disrupt the boat race. Gill also raises criticism towards the portrayal of the American contingent in "True Blue" and its film adaptation.

FS Class 910

FS Class 910 were 2-6-2 tank locomotives designed by Guglielmo Cappa for Rete Sicula where they were registered as RS Class 400. They were absorbed by Italian State Railways (FS) in 1905 and became FS Class 910.
History.
With the conventions of 1885, Rete Sicula took over the lines of Società per le Strade Ferrate Calabro-Sicule and had to face the problems of constructing new lines and introducing modern locomotives. The engineer Guglielmo Cappa designed the Class 400 steam locomotives which were re-registered as FS Class 910 on nationalization in 1905. The locomotive was designed to tackle steeply-graded lines, such as Messina - Palermo with its pass of the Peloritani Mountains and its long tunnel. It also had to be suitable for minor local or commuter services and to have the characteristic of bidirectionality, to gain time at terminal stations by avoiding the need for turntables.
The choice was a 2-6-2T which allowed the same speed in both directions of travel. The locomotives were built by Ansaldo of Sampierdarena and deliveries took place during the passage of the Sicula Network to the FS. In 1906 a specimen was exhibited at the Milan Exposition. The first delivery was of 6 locomotives registered by the Sicula network as RS 401-406. Later deliveries were numbered in the FS 91xx series from the start. The entire group became concentrated in Milan for suburban services and those in Sicily were transferred to Milan. Over the years, they underwent small changes and continued to perform good service in the locomotive depots of Milano Centrale and Pavia for the service on the lines from Milan to Bergamo, Como, Lecco and Voghera.
Diesel conversion.
In 1929 the 910.042 was experimentally converted to a Diesel-Zarlatti locomotive. This had a diesel engine and compressed-air transmission, using the original steam cylinders. It was not a great success and had no practical follow-up.
World War II.
During World War II, some locomotives were used for operations in Yugoslavia and seven of them remained there permanently at the end of the war, incorporated by the Yugoslavian Railways (JZ).
Technical features.
The locomotives used saturated steam and compound expansion. The high-pressure cylinder was on the left, with piston valves, and the low-pressure cylinder was on the right, with a slide valve. Outside Walschaerts valve gear was used.
The locomotive frame was carried on three coupled axles and two one-axle trucks, of the Adams type, at the two ends. This made the locomotive stable, even at high speeds, both in forward and reverse. The boiler had 222 fire tubes, increased to 226 in the second ordering series. Despite being a tank engine, the locomotive carried 3,000 kg of coal and 8,000 kg of water. 
A modification carried out from the second series onwards was the increase in the diameter of the carrying wheels from 830 to 960 mm and the replacement of the Nathan lubrication system with a Friedmann lubrication pump. The locomotive was equipped with a compressed air brake and a proportional brake. It was also equipped for steam heating of the train.
Preservation.
Number 910.001 was restored and is at the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa.

Cervantine Collection of the Biblioteca de Catalunya

The Cervantine collection of the Biblioteca de Catalunya is one of the most important collections in public sector about Miguel de Cervantes and his works.
Originally, it derives from a donation of around 3400 volumes of the bibliophile Isidre Bonsoms from Barcelona in 1915. 
It includes the works of Cervantes in original language and translations, works of biographic character and literary criticism as well as adapted and inspired works and Cervantine iconography.
History.
In 1914 Isidre Bonsoms i Sicart (1849-1922), a Catalan bibliophile and erudite, communicated to the responsibles of the Library of Catalonia, inspector Jaume Massó i Torrants and director Jordi Rubió i Balaguer, his plan to transfer the Cervantine collection that he had gathered in many years of laborious searches to the library. A large part of these collected books came originally from the collection of Leopold Rius (1840-1898) who is considered as the father of the modern Cervantine bibliography.
When the recently founded library received the collection of 3.367 volumes in 1915, the items were stored in the Blue Room of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans in the Palau de la Generalitat - at that time headquarters of the library. In 1936 they were moved from this site to the Sala Cervantina of the Biblioteca de Catalunya in the former building of the Hospital de la Santa Creu. In order to promote the accessibility of these precious books, the Institut d’Estudis Catalans hired Joan Givanel as the first keeper of the collection to start the project of a catalogue in 1915.
Due to further donations, acquisitions, exchange and the legal deposit the collection has been developed over the past years and is still continuing to grow. Thus, it currently counts around 9.000 volumes.
Content and particular items.
Despite the bibliographic value of the whole collection, one might also consider the high individual value of numerous pieces.
The collection contains the first editions of every Cervantine work in original language and translations except from "La Galatea" which is conserved in form of a very rare item of the second edition published in 1590 in Lisbon.
The following most valuable items of the famous work of Miguel de Cervantes, "Don Quijote", form part of the collection:
Amongst the graphic works are particularly valuable the collection of 16 watercolour paintings of which 15 served as illustrations for the edition of "Don Quijote" of the Real Academia Española of 1780. Furthermore, there are drawings of for example Antonio Carnicero, José del Castillo and José Brunete and original works of artist like Jaume Juez i Castellà or Eberhard Schlotter.
Besides the original works of Cervantes, biographies, studies and critics of the Cervantine opus are collected, too. Ephimera, from picture and playing cards to posters of cinematic adaptions (like for example "Dulcinea"), as well as some objects, offer – together with the illustrated editions and original graphic works, a broad range of the Cervantine iconography. Furthermore, the collection includes some musical scores like the symphonic poem of "Don Quijote" by Richard Strauss as well as auditory and audio-visual recordings, for example of the opera D.Q.
Finally, the oil portrait of Isidre Bonsoms, by the painter José María Vidal-Quadras and the bonze bust of Cervantes by the sculptor Josep Reynés, preside in the Sala Cervantina of the Biblioteca de Catalunya.
The Memória Digital de Catalunya dedicated an entry to the Cervatine Collection that is going to be increased with the most excellent works of public dominion.

Four Times That Night

Four Times That Night () is a 1971 commedia sexy all'italiana film directed by Mario Bava.
Plot.
Male model John Price encounters Tina Bryant while walking her poodle, "Cool Rump", in a park. Although she initially resists his advances, they flirt after John accidentally trips over the dog, and agree to a date that evening. While picking her up, John is cautioned by Tina's strict, widowed mother Sonia that her daughter is a Catholic and a virgin, and is not to be taken advantage of. After dancing at a discoteque, Tina becomes uncomfortable with John's insistent leering, and the pair agree to return home.
Early next morning, Tina returns to her mother's apartment with her expensive mini-dress torn beyond repair. When Sonia questions her, Tina declares that John tried to rape her.
Tina's story.
On their way home, John invited Tina back to his apartment as he was expecting a business call. She opted to wait outside, but after being teased by two gay neighbours, George and Esmeralda, she decided to go into the apartment, a stereotypical swinger's pad. John left the room to change into a sweater, but returned in his underwear and attempted to mount Tina; during the altercation, he tore through the dress and she scratched his forehead in self-defence. After barricading herself in the bedroom, she escaped.
John's story.
John returns to the discoteque and drinks with three of his friends. Their curiosities are piqued by his forehead injury, prompting him to share his side of the story.
In his recollection, both Sonia and Tina were unrelentingly coquettish towards him, and the latter was more than willing to return to his apartment. The pair had sex multiple times throughout the night, and Tina's libidinousness eventually tired John; she unwittingly scratched him while stroking his hair. Tina's chance for another tryst was lost when they were visited by George and Esmeralda, forcing them to end their date with light conversation.
The Doorman's story.
As John returns home, his sex-crazed, voyeuristic doorman converses with a milkman, claiming to have watched the encounter through binoculars.
John had brought Tina home to provide Esmerelda with company while he and George had sex in his bedroom. To dissuade Tina's disbelief about John's homosexuality, Esmeralda told her of how they met at the Club Karma Sutra, which turned out to be a story of how she convinced a German woman to pose for nude photographs. When Tina reacted in shock to John and George's lovemaking, Esmeralda drugged her drink, rendering her unconscious, and raped her. When Tina awoke and tried to escape, her dress was torn as she tried to retrieve it from John, who she scratched as he held her down for Esmeralda to take advantage of again.
The Scientist's story.
After presenting a lecture on perception, a scientist proposes a fourth version of the story.
Here, John and Tina's initial encounter and date were friendly and without conflict. John suggested that they share a drink at his apartment, offering to keep his door open as a sign of trust. There, both admitted their mutual attraction, but decided that they would share intimacy once they knew each other better. As John and Tina left, they discovered that the front gate was jammed; their attempts to call for the doorman were fruitless due to him being distracted by his pornography collection. John tried to lift Tina over the gate so she could unlock it from the outside, but her dress got torn on the gate, and she scratched his forehead after she nearly fell to the ground; when Tina worried about how Sonia would respond to the torn dress, John jokingly suggested that she tell her that he tried to rape her. They then waited until another occupant was able to let them out. Upon George and Esmerelda's arrival, the doorman arrived to fix the gate, and John and Tina drove away.
The scientist is dissatisfied with this apparently "true" account, and questions the logic of the "open door" policy, as well as the couple's response to the jammed gate. Suggesting that the truth is hidden amid the embellishments and falsehoods provided by these four accounts, he reveals that the only fact he is certain of is that rather than immediately returning to Sonia's, the couple drove to the seaside to watch the sunrise together.
Release.
"Four Times That Night" was shown in Montreal on March 12, 1971.

Jovan Kosturi

Jovan Cico Kosturi (1831-1924), also known as Jovan Kosturi, was involved in the Albanian National Awakening.
Founded in early 1880s, the magazine "Drita" by 1884 was led by Kosturi along with Orhan Pojani and Thimi Marko while it was distributed throughout Toskëria (southern Albania) and it advocated for Albanian language education in the Tosk dialect. During 1885, Kosturi set up a secret committee in Korçë with the aim of preparing an Albanian cultural society in the interior of the country. In 1906, Greek bishop Photios was assassinated by an Albanian guerilla band and as Ottoman authorities could not arrest the assassins, Kosturi and other Albanian notables involved in the national movement from Korçë were imprisoned. After some months the Greeks retaliated by assassinating Kosturi's son Spiro Kosturi in Salonica. Kosturi was also the father of Idhomene Kosturi, an Albanian politician, regent and once acting Prime Minister of Albania.

Hermann Bote

Hermann Bote (also "Hermen Bote", c. 1450 – c. 1520) was a Middle Low German author and chronicler.
Life.
A native of Braunschweig, he served as a city scribe for octroi (tariffs) in that city from 1488.
In that year, in the context of a popular rebellion in Braunschweig, he composed a number of satirical poems against city councillor Ludeke Hollant. After a period of exile, he appears as the keeper of the city wine cellar during 1493–1496, and in 1497 was re-introduced to his former function of city scribe.
Renewed political unrest in 1513 resulted in his losing his office once again and being arrested. 
He was condemned to death, but the sentence was converted to house arrest at the last minute .
In 1516 he is recorded as manager of the city brickyard.
Literary production.
Bote is the author of "Boek van veleme rade" (1491), a description of the feudal order of the day.
His chronicle, known as the "Braunschweiger Weltchronik", covers the period from 1444 to 1516.
"Reynke de vos", a Low German adaptation of the older "Reynard" material printed in Lübeck in 1498, is sometimes attributed to Bote. In 1503, he published a "Zollbuch", dealing with tariffs.
In 1514, he published "Schichtbuch" ("Schicht" being the local term for revolt or civil unrest), including both earlier revolts and the revolt of 1487–1489 he had himself been involved in.
Attached to the chronicle is a brief description of the churches, monasteries and chapels in Braunschweig and a "Wappenbuch".
In 1517, Bote published a collections of aphorisms under the title "De Köker".
In 1518, he published a revised chronicle, known as the "Hannoversche Weltchronik".
His latest known publication is a satirical poem on the Hildesheim Diocesan Feud, written in 1519.
Bote has also been suggested as the author of the first printed chapbook on Till Eulenspiegel, printed in 1510 under the title of "Ein kurtzweilig Lesen von Dil Ulenspiegel geboren uß dem Land zu Brunßwick".
This publication, extremely successful in the course of the 16th century, was signed by its author only with "N."
Authorship of Bote was suggested due to the acrostic "ERMAN B" being formed by the initials of chapters 90 to 95.

2018 Riyadh missile strike

The 2018 Riyadh missile strike was a series of seven missiles launched into Saudi Arabia by Shiite Houthi rebels on 26 March 2018, targeting the King Khalid International Airport and other sites. Saudi forces claimed to have destroyed all seven missile, three of them targeting Riyadh, two targeting Jazan, and one targeting Najran. However according to Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at CNS, the Saudis failed to intercept the missiles following a malfunction of the MIM-104 Patriot system. One video appeared to show a Patriot missile launch on Sunday night go rapidly wrong, with the missile changing course midair, crashing into a neighborhood in Riyadh and exploding. Another appeared to detonate shortly after being launched in the Saudi capital.
The news channel, Al Arabiya, aired footage that it said showed Patriot missile batteries firing at the incoming Houthi missiles. Online videos showed what appeared to be a missile fuselage lying on a street in Riyadh.
The UN Security Council condemned the attack. An Egyptian man was killed and two others were wounded when a fragment of one of the missiles over Riyadh fell over a neighborhood. 
Al Masirah, a Houthi-run satellite news channel, identified some of the missiles fired as the Burkan, or Volcano missile. The United Nations, Western countries and the Saudi-led military coalition fighting in Yemen all said the Burkan mirrors characteristics of an Iranian Qiam ballistic missile. They said that suggests Iran either shared the technology or smuggled disassembled missiles to the Houthis, who then rebuilt them.
A spokesperson for the embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia said "seven ballistic missiles were shot toward Saudi Arabia from within Yemen." A press conference was held the same day at 1 p.m. "to provide more details about this aggressive act."

History of home keyboards

The history of home keyboards lies in mechanical musical instrument keyboards, electrified keyboards and 1960s and 1970s synthesizer technologies.
Mechanical keyboard instruments.
Keyboard instruments can be found as far back as the hydraulis (a water organ) in the 3rd century BCE, which developed into the pipe organ, and small portable instruments such as the portative and positive organ. Additional keyboard instruments, the clavichord (tangent-struck strings) and harpsichord (quill-plucked strings), were developed in the 14th century CE. As technology improved, more sophisticated keyboards were developed, including the 12-tone keyboard still in use today. Initially, the keyboard of an instrument such as a pipe organ or harpsichord could only produce sounds of one particular volume. In the 18th century, the pianoforte was invented. The pianoforte had metal strings which were struck by hammers which were activated by pressing or striking the keys. Depending on whether the keys were pressed lightly or forcefully, the pianoforte would produce a softer or louder sound.
Early electrified keyboards.
The next step towards creating electric keyboards was to apply electric sound technology. The first electric musical instrument of any type was the Denis d'or stringed instrument, which was built by Václav Prokop Diviš in 1748. It had 700 strings temporarily electrified to enhance their sonic qualities. In 1760, Jean Baptiste Thillaie de Laborde developed the clavecin électrique. This was a keyboard instrument played with plectra and activated by electricity, but neither instrument used electricity to produce sound. In 1874, Elisha Gray invented an electric musical instrument called the musical telegraph. It made sound from an electromagnetic circuit's vibration. He later incorporated a basic single note oscillator and a loudspeaker consisting of diaphragm to make these notes audible.
Electric keyboards and synthesizers.
In 1906, Lee de Forest invented the triode electronic valve. In 1915 he invented the first vacuum tube instrument, the audio piano. Until the invention of the transistor, the vacuum tube was an essential component in electric instruments. In 1935, the Hammond organ was introduced, exploiting previous limited production efforts like the Robb Wave Organ from 1923. It was capable of producing polyphonic sounds by virtue of a spinning shaft with many magnetic 'lobes' which would cycle past an electromagnetic pickup at a rate that would produce each desired tone. The Hammond organ was connected to a power amplifier and a speaker cabinet. In 1929, the electric piano was invented. In 1939, Hammond introduced the Novachord which used about 170 vacuum tubes, coils, capacitors and resistors largely to create an upper octave of notes and then divide them in half using 'flip flop' circuits to create successively lower octaves from each note. The instrument also has many features like envelopes for filter and amplifiers so that sounds can be contoured at the user's discretion, making it the first production analog synthesizer.
In 1941, Georges Jenny's previously prototyped Ondioline became the first truly portable synthesizer keyboard (the Novachord weighed over ). More developments were made with the Chamberlin Music Maker in late 1940s and the Mellotron in the early 1950s, which employed mechanisms to play back recordings at speeds that would produce the desired tone for the key being struck. Other technologies improved on this idea over the years. Machines like the Optigan used photo-emulsion to create disks that had images whose density would convert to waveforms when spun in front of a beam/sensor assembly. In 1981 the E-mu Emulator was marketed to digitally store samples and play them back.
The first step towards the electric piano was by Harold Rhodes who developed various prototypes using parts from B-17 aircraft that were being scrapped. He received a medal since the resulting keyboard was used as therapy for people rehabilitating from injuries from WW2. (It is small enough to set on a stand over a patient's bed in a hospital, looking something like a miniature grand piano in shape.) Instructions were made and people built this "pre-piano" which amplifies the signals generated in a pickup from the vibration of stainless steel rods tapered near the steel base they are driven into holes in. Piano type wooden hammers are used to strike them. It was a three octave (E to F for 38 notes) instrument. A tube amplifier drove a speaker pointing out the bottom.
In 1955, the Wurlitzer Company released the company's first electric piano, the model 100. The wurlitzer strikes flat tines whose vibration is amplified from a surrounding electrostatic charged 'comb'. In '59 the Fender company bought the Rhodes name and produced the piano bass and then in the mid-'60s began producing the famous Fender Rhodes series which used rod shaped tines mounted on a steel piece that runs parallel above them, with a coil pickup on each individual tine. The invention of the transistor in 1959 spawned the production of progressively more compact keyboards. Many home organs maintained the appearance but lost some weight due to the lower power consumption needs of transistor circuitry. Also in this era 'combo organs' found a lot of use like the famous Vox Continental used by the Beatles and others, the Gibson G101 used by The Doors, and other organs by Farfisa, Wurlitzer, Acetone (Roland) and others. These were usually built using 12 oscillators and transistor pair 'divider' circuits to produce all the frequencies like all non- 'tone wheel' electronic organs of the era. They were just more compact and thus suited for 'combo' use.
Synthesizers.
The exploration of musical synthesizers in the 1960s was a step towards the modern keyboard. As technology became more developed, huge synthesizers evolved into portable instruments that could be used in live shows. The rapid accumulation of momentum began in 1964 when Bob Moog produced his Moog synthesizer. It used a remote keyboard and was 'modular' in design. (i.e. it was a rack that held boxes which each had a function. At least one was to create a tone controlled in pitch by a voltage input, and usually a host of other modules including filters, amplifiers, envelope generators, etc.) His next generation was equipped with a built-in keyboard in 1970: the Mini-Moog. These keyboards were monophonic, along with semi-modulars like the ARP2600, and were only able to respond to one note at a time. (Though three oscillators could be layered together in response to the 'control voltage' produced by that note.)
In 1972, instruments such as the EML 101, ARP Odyssey, and Moog Sonic six were duo-phonic meaning they could produce two different tones at once when two different keys were pressed. And in 1974 Oberheim produced the first polyphonic synthesizer using their SEM Modules (which were originally designed to allow musicians to just layer more complex sounds together in a monophonic 'stack'.) They produced a key assigner circuit that would assign a note to one of several SEM modules. (They came in 2, 4 and 8 voice racks eventually.) When more notes were hit than the number of racks available, the latest note would have to 'steal' one of the SEM modules from the note it had been assigned to. These polyphonic synthesizers were very popular eventually and Yamaha produced the CS-50 in 1976 which had four voices that didn't have to be individually programmed in order for them to sound the same. A sea of other entries followed.
In 1970, Ken Freeman demonstrated the first 'string machine' which was essentially combo-organ like in size and how it generated tones. It had simple controls though centered around creating an ensemble effect where vibrato is happening at slightly different rates on different notes like in a real orchestra. Freeman used six discrete LFOs (low frequency oscillator circuits) to modulate atypically hit together note combinations (diminished fifth combinations like C and F). It had two 'ranks' of 12 oscillators plus a single oscillator driving a chip that develops the top octave of notes in the version that hit market in 1974. In November 1974 the British patent 1,509,530 lists an electronic digital musical arranger by Nicholas Kenneth Kirk. This patent was sold to Waddington's House of Games as Compute-a-Tune. This product was marketed in the early 1980s and sold a few thousand or so in the £15 range. The ARP Solina String Ensemble and Crumar Stringman used a much less expensive approach using digitally clocked chips called BBDs. Only a few hundred were made.
In 1973, the Yamaha GX-1 was manufactured. It was an early polyphonic synthesizer, featuring eight voices. In 1974, Roland Corporation released the EP-30, the first touch-sensitive keyboard. Roland also released early polyphonic string synthesizers, the RS-101 in 1975 and the RS-202 in 1976.
In 1975, the turn towards building a synthesizer of sorts over an organ came to fruition in Moog's Polymoog. Many patents exist from this keyboard. Each note had its own circuit board with a VCF/VCA chip so that it was truly fully polyphonic. Many were disappointed that the filter lacked the facilities of the more flexible moog filter used in other keyboards and the abundance of unreliable connectors. In 1975 Crumar of Italy produced the "Multiman" which also was an organ with synthesizer facilities. It had a bass option, a brass with filter controls and simple envelope, a piano and clavi preset, and a couple string tabs with decay control and vibrato control. In 1976 the ARP Omni combined a more limited synthesizer with a string machine and bass also and became ARP's biggest seller. In the same year, the Korg PE-1000 used an individual saw oscillator for each note.
In 1977, the Yamaha CS-60 and CS-80 polyphonic synthesizers began to implement synthesizer 'memory'. However, it was merely an alternate set of sliders that hid under a hatch. In 1978, the OB-1 from Oberheim gave actual electronic storage of the sound settings. The Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 the same year offered this feature in a five voice polyphonic synthesizer. Dave Smith's company developed some other firsts, but the ARP engineers were acquired by Fender when they bought the mismanaged company in 1979. They completed the Fender Rhodes Chroma, the first computer controlled keyboard. Released in 1981, an Apple computer could be used to run sequencing software that allowed the user to easily program which notes were being hit at particular instants in the song production. The 'Chroma' port only appeared on the successor though, the Chroma Polaris in 1984.
MIDI keyboards.
Dave Smith's company found interest in a cooperative effort with Roland. In 1983, the invention of MIDI as a standard for digital code transmission digital technology development spurred on more great development in keyboard technology, as now keyboards from different manufacturers could communicate through an inexpensive cable, jack and system of codes. The Sequential Circuits Prophet 600 and the Roland Jupiter 6 communicated via MIDI at the NAMM trade show and Yamaha soon had the standard implemented into their DX synthesizers which would outsell all previous keyboards.
The Yamaha DX7 used entirely digital circuitry leaving it free from the need of calibration, and vast numbers of parameters that could be accessed. The "FM" (frequency modulation) synthesis method was something that had not been explored to near this depth. Most synthesizers before this were subtractive synthesis, i.e. starting with a very harmonic-laden sound and selectively subtracting from this sound using low, high or bandpass filters, or some other methods that tended to result in stranger sounds, like ring modulation. Also in 1983, Dave Smith's company marketed the first polyphonic synthesizer keyboard that could play more than one sound at a time called the 'Six-Trak'. It had a six track sequencer and each track could access a different sound. The same year the SCI Prophet T8 with optical key sensing became the first piano action emulating MIDI keyboard.
After ARP's demise, the remaining companies that had produced analog synthesizers rapidly began to feel the stress of the newly popular digital synths. Roland and Korg, also from Japan, developed some innovations of their own and each had 'hit' keyboards: the D-50 from Roland and M1 from Korg in the late 1980s. The total unit sales for the Yamaha DX series reached over 1 million with the others from Roland and Korg over 250,000. The success of the D-50 and M1 was riding on the back of the Kurzweil K250, which first applied this technology well in 1984. This machine was the first fully digital workstation with facilities to sample acoustic sounds with a microphone and play them back with a rate that is proportioned for the note being struck. Many great samples were included in the unit, including a piano sound that is still used in the 2000s. As well, the samples can be routed through a synthesizer architecture of some kind.
Initially, some companies steered away from emulating the subtractive synthesis in the digital realm because it was difficult to model how a filter would respond to these complex signals. By the early 1990s, some new implementations were beginning to appear. The Peavey DPM series also touted as the first keyboards that could import samples which were not 'sampling keyboards'. They also were the first to use off the shelf DSP chips, which emulated the response of analog filters. This sample playback technology also spawned a vast number of inexpensive consumer units called in electronics stores and toy stores. As the price of memory began to plummet, almost every company was making keyboards of this type. Casio and Yamaha have led sales in these types of units, which feature built in speaker systems, usually can run from batteries or power adapters, and have a library of samples with very limited editing, if any. They often use cheap plastic strips of keys to keep costs down.
On a different note, the Kurzweil K150 and the Kawai K5 explored additive synthesis where harmonics can be proportioned to make different tones while enveloping groups of them differently in the mid-'80s. RMI had explored this to a limited extent in 1974 with the harmonic synthesizer they produced. This less common synthesis method is also used in Kawai's last synthesizer product series, the K5000s from 1996. Organs like the Hammond B-3 use drawbars to control harmonic content of the tone, but the K5000 has an envelope for each harmonic in the entire audio spectrum and dynamic filter control over that for vast possibilities in sound creation.

Hugues Libergier

Hugues Libergier (Unknown–1263) was a medieval French architect and master mason of the Gothic era who worked in Reims, France. He contributed to the Rayonnant Gothic style, and notably directed the building of the begun in 1231. Libergier is commemorated on a tomb slab that now resides in Reims Cathedral.
Abbey of Saint-Nicaise.
The Abbey of Saint-Nicaise was designed by Libergier, and its construction started in 1231. The church's nave, portals, and facade were finished before Libergier's death in 1263. After his death, work was resumed in 1264 by Robert de Coucy to be completed in 1311. Libergier was buried at Saint-Nicaise, but the church was destroyed in 1798 during the French Revolution. Other than the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise in Reims, Libergier is not known to have designed any other buildings.
Innovations and influence.
Libergier produced a unique architecture that modified the existing Gothic style of the time, and contributed to the development of the Rayonnant Gothic style in France. One of Libergier's innovations at Saint-Nicaise was a gabled screen that was stretched across the portal zone of the facade. Elements of Libergier's design influenced other Gothic churches including Reims Cathedral and Notre-Dame Cathedral.
Tomb slab.
After Saint-Nicaise was destroyed, Libergier's tomb was transferred to Reims Cathedral in 1800. The slab of his catafalque was the only survivor of destruction. On the slab, he is represented in his city costume, and he is depicted with the tools of his profession. In his right arm, he holds a model of the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise, and in his left hand, he holds a measuring rod. A try square and a sector are portrayed at his feet.
The slab reads: "ci-gît maistre Hugues Libergiers qui commença ceste église en l'an de l'incarnation MCC et XXIX [1229] le mardi de Pâques et trépassa en l'an de l'incarnation MCCLXIII [1263] le samedi après Pâques. Pour Dieu, priez pour lui".

Studenčište Marsh

Studenchishte Marsh is the last remains of a previously extensive wetland habitat on the eastern shore of ancient Lake Ohrid in North Macedonia. It is also the final major coastline wetland at Lake Ohrid and one of only seven marshes with relict communities that still exist in North Macedonia. With several millennia of natural history, it is a site of key conservation interest and part of the Lake Ohrid Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention. 
Flora and Fauna.
Furnishing habitat for a wide variety of species, Studenchishte Marsh harbors flora and fauna that differ substantially to those of Lake Ohrid, which is one of the most biodiverse inland waters on Earth. Consequently, the marsh contributes significantly to the biological, ecosystemic and habitat diversity of the Ohrid region, which is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in part due to the Outstanding Universal Value of its nature.
Historically, Studenchishte Marsh was one of Lake Ohrid's most important nesting sites for birds and spawning locations for cyprinid fish, although much of this significance has been lost in recent years due to a range of anthropogenic pressures. Nonetheless, while far fewer birds nest at Studenchishte than in previous times, its avifauna still boasts 79 species, and Studenchishte Canal, which marks the northern border of the wetland area, remains inhabited by 17 kinds of fish, including several that are endemic to the Ohrid region. 
Among the minimum nine varieties of amphibian to be found in the area, the Macedonian Crested Newt ("Triturus macedonicus") and Yellow-Bellied Toad ("Bombina variegata") are noteworthy. Reptile and mammal fauna is insubstantially researched, although the European pond turtle and three species of snake are confirmed in the former category, and otter, fox, beech marten and European polecat in the latter. Studenchishte is likely home to several rodent and bat species, yet precise data is lacking.
Among invertebrates, Studenchishte Marsh and its surrounding coastal waters display 16% of the Gastropoda, 20% of the Tricladida, 35% of the Oligochaeta and 22.5% of the Chironomidae found at Lake Ohrid, while the 9 planarian taxa of the wetland include several that are endemic to Lake Ohrid's coastal springs. Beetles, one of the few insects to have been studied in detail, appear in 39 different varieties, some of which have not been recorded anywhere else in North Macedonia, and biological diversity is further boosted by 34 kinds of dragon and damselflies, 19% of which are specific to Southern Europe.
In terms of plants, Studenchishte supports a wide variety of habitats including alkaline marshes and fens, and semi-natural wet meadows. The alkaline fens have higher nutrient levels, which encourages greater plant and animal diversity. The result is a flora that displays 50% of the total diversity of plant associations recorded for marshes in North Macedonia. In addition, ten rare and relict species have been recorded in the location, indicating that it has refugial qualities for wetland flora. Half of these are now believed to have been extirpated from the location, but others such as "Carex elata" may offer a source from which to rehabilitate other degraded wetlands in North Macedonia. Nationally vulnerable and endangered species according to IUCN criteria, such as Water Caltrop ("Trapa natans") and Floating Fern ("Salvinia natans"), are also important components of the flora. 
Recently, significant populations of endemic diatom species have been found at Studenchishte, including species that are believed to be new to science. 
Ecosystem Services.
Studenchishte Marsh instigates benefits to the local region beyond habitat provision for biodiversity. Its 5-meter deep peatlands, which have accumulated over 5,000 years, provide carbon storage and its function as a natural filter prevents nutrients from entering Lake Ohrid and thereby buffers against eutrophication. This is significant due to the research opportunities presented by Lake Ohrid's unique ecosystem, which depends on its highly specific water conditions. In previous years, as a location for spawning fish, Studenchishte Marsh was additionally a contributor to Lake Ohrid fisheries, although this function has been severely depleted. The wetland acts as natural mitigation against flooding.
Threats.
Much of Studenchishte Marsh's previous surface area has been converted into farmland, roads or buildings. It has been further degraded by large-scale construction of tourism facilities. Several of the channels that once connected it with Lake Ohrid have been disrupted. The urbanization of beaches has caused the depletion of reed belts. Additionally, high volumes of construction waste have been deposited in the wetland, covering six hectares. As a result, its ability to shelter and raise fish populations has been almost totally lost alongside much of its importance for birds.
Modification of the General Urban Plan for the City of Ohrid 2014-2024 envisaged draining the area almost completely and replacing it with tourism accommodation, recreation facilities, a marina and a sports center. These intentions sparked international attention and the 2015 establishment of a citizen initiative, Ohrid SOS, which was created in opposition to the plans. Global scientific organizations such as the Society of Wetland Scientists (SWS) and International Society of Limnology (SIL) also spoke out on the issue.
In 2017, proposals to drain and develop Studenchishte were reversed although local government plans for a marina continue to lack clarification.
Protected Status.
Designation for Studenchishte Marsh as a protected natural area has been suggested for decades, although it has never been completed at a national level. An expert study on the wetland proposed a 63.97-hectare area to receive Monument of Nature (Category III) status in 2012. 
However, a 2020 valorisation conducted as part of the legally required process for establishment of a protected area at Studenchishte has reduced the envisaged protection category to Nature Park (IUCN Category IV), which, unlike a Monument of Nature, would not require a buffer zone under Macedonian law. Compared with the 2012 proposal, it also foresees contracting the overall boundaries to 60.23 hectares and decreasing internal Zones of Strict Protection and Zones of Active Management to just 34% of the area. 
An Ohrid SOS proposal endorsed by the Society of Wetlands Scientists for Studenchishte Marsh and Lake Ohrid to apply for proclamation as a Wetland of International Importance under the Ramsar Convention was submitted to the Macedonian government in 2017. At its 60th session on March 20, 2018, the government took the decision to proceed with nomination of Studenchishte as both a Monument of Nature (IUCN Category III) and Ramsar Site (alongside Lake Ohrid). Ramsar status was confirmed in February 2021, but the wetland has still not been proclaimed a protected area at the national level. 
Declaration on the Protection of the Lake Ohrid Ecosystem.
The Declaration on the Protection of the Lake Ohrid Ecosystem, passed unanimously by 45 attending members of the Society of Wetland Scientists Europe Chapter at its 13th annual meeting from 30 April to 4 May 2018, makes specific reference to the critical importance of Studenchishte Marsh for its species composition and rarity, undisturbed peat layers, and ecosystem services. It calls for an urgent action plan to protect and revitalize the wetland with the long-term aim of rewetting agricultural areas.

Thimi Marko

Thimi Marko was a figure from Korçë involved in the Albanian National Awakening during the late Ottoman period.
Founded in early 1880s, the magazine "Drita" by 1884 was led by Marko along with Orhan Pojani and Jovan Kosturi while it was distributed throughout Toskeria (southern Albania) and it advocated for Albanian language education in the Tosk dialect. Marko in 1885 was given the task by "Drita" to discuss with the Greek Metropolitan and his council ("Demogerontia") the matter of introducing Albanian into Orthodox schools in Korçë, however the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople refused. Marko was one of four trustees of the boys school in Korçë and in 1903 Ottoman authorities concerned with Albanian education and national sentiments arrested and exiled him to Salonica. 
A school in Korçë is named after Thimi Marko.

Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator

The Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator is a telegraph instrument invented by Edward Kleinschmidt which prepares punched tape for telegraph transmission. A QWERTY keyboard operate hole punches that prepare a Wheatstone slip. Each Morse code of the dots and dashes for the letter is selected by projecting tongues on the key bar. The centre holes used for the paper feed are punched first, then the lower holes, and then the upper holes. The upper holes are the mark holes, which indicate when the symbol (dot or dash) starts, and the lower hole tell when to terminate the symbol. This keyboard can be operated at up to 80 words a minute by a skilled operator.
The Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator was first invented and constructed by Kleinschmidt in 1911. Kleinschmidt wanted to develop a product that could be sold to telegraph companies rather than just selling patents. Western Union Telegraph Company was the first to purchase 50 units. As a result of this order, the Kleinschmidt Electric Company was formed to manufacture the perforator. F. G. Creed ordered ten machines for the "Creed high-speed Continental Morse code system". The British Post Office ordered 20, and then later in 1914 ordered another 100. Later the Teletype Corporation also made this machine.
In London they were sold by Creed &amp; Co, which had a sales contract with the Kleinschmidt Electric Company.

Callerebia polyphemus

Callerebia polyphemus is a butterfly found in the east Palearctic (western China and Japan) that belongs to the browns family (Nymphalidae). The species was first described by Charles Oberthür in 1876.
Description from Seitz.
"Callerebia polyphemus" Oberthür (34 f) is by far the largest form of the whole genus, being easily recognized by the size alone; the upperside of the forewing bears frequently accessory ocelli. — "hybrida" Btlr. [Pradesh, India "Callerebia hybrida" Butler, 1880] (= "annada" Marsh and de Nicev. in tab.) (35 a), which is only half the size, has an oval apical ocellus on the forewing and 2 ocelli in the anal area of the underside of the hindwing; comes nearest to the name-typical annada. — "ophthalmica" Nicev. [ = "Callerebia orixa" Moore, 1872 sic] is exactly like "orixa" ["Callerebia orixa" Moore, 1872], except that but a form of "annada"; still smaller than the latter, but of exactly the same shape, the anal lobe of the hindwing not being very strongly developed. The border of the ocellus of the forewing is continued towards the hindmargin of the wing as an orange-brown band, within which there are 2 ocelli; the hindwing, too, bears 2 submarginal small ocelli on the upperside. From Western Se-chuen.

Haval H9

The Haval H9 is a full-size SUV produced by Haval, a sub-brand of Great Wall Motors debuted on the 2014 Beijing Auto Show and commenced production in November 2014.
Overview.
The Haval H9 is the largest vehicle ever developed by Great Wall Motors with the drive train being a new all-wheel drive system, and is the second brand new SUV with a body-on-frame chassis developed by Haval, following the Haval H3 and Haval H5. It competes with the likes of the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado and Mitsubishi Pajero. The H9 is available in both 5-seater and 7-seater configurations.
Construction is a body-on-frame chassis underpinned with double-wishbone front suspension, and a multi-link solid axle at the rear. Initial H9's were powered by a turbocharged 2.0L I4 petrol engine with at 5500 rpm, and of torque between 2000-4000 rpm with power being sent through a 6-speed automatic transmission. In 2017, the 2.0L had been reworked to produce at 5500 rpm, and of torque between 1800-4500 rpm. A ZF 8-speed automatic transmission was also added to improve fuel efficiency and performance. 
An All-Terrain four-wheel-drive control system is available and modulates engine response between various modes including Auto, Snow, Sand, Mud and 4 Low. 
The H9 was given a facelift for 2019 onwards consisting of a new front end as well as the rear spare tyre moved from the rear door to the bottom of the car. 
Australian market.
The Haval H9 SUV was upgraded for the 2018 model year in the fourth quarter of 2017. The exterior features new grilles, fog lights and new alloy wheels, while the interior feature a new instrument panel with digital speedometer.
The main changes to the 2018 Haval H9 involve the engine and powertrain, with power from the 2.0-liter turbo-petrol four-cylinder engine tuned up from 160kW to 180kW, while the torque has increased from 324Nm to 350Nm. The six-speed automatic transmission was replaced by a ZF eight-speed transmission for the 2018 facelift and fuel economy has improved from 12.1L/100km to 11.0L/100km as a result. Acceleration time from 0 to 100km/h has decreased from 13.4 to 10.6sec. For the safety features of the 2018 model year Haval H9, Lane departure warning and blind spot monitoring are standard features, while the top of the trim LUX model comes with an additional panoramic sunroof. In terms of off-road performance, Haval Australia has also been working with Australian suspension company Ironman 4X4 to develop an exclusive Australian suspension tune for the Australian market Haval H9s. The results are heavier springs, upgraded shock absorber valving, and toe-in minor changes. All 2018 H9 models feature a new anti-lock brake system module with re-calibrated electronic stability control. 
Haval’s Australian dealer network is 15 nationwide as of 2017, growing from four dealers at the brand’s Australian launch in 2015. A further 10 dealers are expected to join the fold by the beginning of 2018 and Haval is aiming to have a total of 50 dealers in Australia by 2020. Haval sells its vehicles in more than 30 regions internationally including Australia, Russia, Ecuador, Chile, Malaysia, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and UAE. As a result, Haval’s annual global crossover and SUV sales have grown from 281,000 to 938,000 from 2012 to 2017.
In 2015, ANCAP rated the car with 4 stars out of five.
In this rating the car has some safety features: intelligent seat belt reminder (driver, front passenger and 2 nd row seats), frontal and side, head protection Airbag, Antilock braking system (ABS), electronic brakeforce distribution (EBD), electronic stability control (ESC), emergency brake assist (EBA), fatigue detection (Attention assist), daytime running lights (DRL), Hill launch assist, reversing collision avoidance, roll stability system and tyre pressure monitoring system (TPMS).

Diesel-Zarlatti locomotive

The Diesel-Zarlatti locomotive was a prototype railway locomotive, built in Italy in 1929, which adopted a hybrid diesel-steam transmission system.
History.
In the 1920s, there was a search for alternatives to the steam locomotive for railway traction, to reduce cost and improve efficiency. The main alternatives were railway electrification or the use of an internal combustion engine, such as the diesel engine.
A disadvantage of the internal combustion engine was the need for a transmission system. One option to be explored was the conversion of an existing steam locomotive by fitting a diesel engine and an air compressor to supply compressed air to the existing steam cylinders. This was the constructive principle on which the Zarlatti locomotive was based. It may be seen as a development of the earlier Mekarski system.
Between 1928 and 1929, FS steam locomotive number 910.042 was modified at the Royal Arsenal of La Spezia to test the system, which was based on the patents of the inventors Fausto Zarlatti and Umberto Simoni. If the system had been a success, it could have led to the modification of a large number of FS steam locomotives and the avoidance of the need to build new locomotives.
The tests took place on the Rome–Lido railway from 6 April to 25 April 1929 with 16 round-trip pairs. The maximum speed reached with a tail load of 101 tonnes was 74 km/h. The experiment had some success but there were problems. On 17 April, the piston of the engine water circulation pump broke and on 23 April a Westinghouse compressor tube was removed. The experiment, for these reasons, had no practical follow-up.
Technical features.
The boiler and superstructure were removed from the locomotive in the arsenal workshop at La Spezia but the original compound expansion steam cylinders were left in place. A six-cylinder, two-stroke, diesel engine built by Fiat-San Giorgio was installed. This engine produced 325 hp at 450 rpm and drove a rotary compressor, built by a Swiss company in Winterthur, which delivered compressed air at 8 bar pressure. A small naphtha-fired boiler with a heating surface of 52 square metres was also installed for the production of steam. Cooling water from the engine and compressor was fed into the boiler at about 70°C. For cold starting, the boiler was used to preheat the diesel engine. When the locomotive started from rest, the original steam cylinders were fed with steam alone, but when running they were powered by a mixture of steam and compressed air. The steam was needed to prevent the cylinders icing up, because compressed air cools when it expands.

Four Course

Four Course (1928 – 1932) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. She was one of the best two-year-old fillies of her generation in England when she won three of her four races, namely the July Stakes, Richmond Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In the following spring she won the 1000 Guineas and finished second in both the Epsom Oaks and the Falmouth Stakes. She was retired at the end of the year but died before she could make and mark as a broodmare.
Background.
Four Course was a bay mare bred in England by J P Arkwright. As a foal the filly was put up for auction at Newmarket and was bought for 910 guineas by the trainer Fred Darling. A year later she returned to the sales ring and fetched 3,000 guineas with the winning bid coming from Lord Ellesmere. She was trained throughout her racing career by Darling at Beckhampton in Wiltshire.
Four Course's sire Tetratema, was the leading British two-year-old of 1919 and went on to win the 2000 Guineas and many important sprint races. As a breeding stallion, Tetratema sired many good sprinters and milers including Tiffin, Mr Jinks and Myrobella and was the British champion sire in 1929. Four Course's dam, Dinner became an influential broodmare whose descendants included Ridge Wood, Old Vic, High Top and Acatenango.
Racing career.
1930: two-year-old season.
As a two-year-old in 1930, Four Course was ridden in most of her races by Freddie Fox. In her first engagement at Royal Ascot in June she started favourite but finished second to the colt Goyescas in the Chesham Stakes. For the rest of the season the filly continued to be matched against male opposition, eschewing in the main fillies' races. At Newmarket Racecourse in the following month she won the July Stakes at odds of 15/8, from a field which included Portlaw (later to win the Middle Park Stakes). A month later at Goodwood Racecourse she started 8/13 favourite for the Richmond Stakes and won from the colt Disarmament. Another win followed at York Racecourse on 28 August when she prevailed by a short head and a neck from Lampeto and Pisa in the Gimcrack Stakes.
By the end of the season, Four Course had earned £5,220 in first-place prize money. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best juveniles, she was rated the second best filly of 1930 behind the Aga Khan's Turtle Soup.
1931: three-year-old season.
On 1 May 1931, Four Course started at odds of 11/1 in a twenty-runner field for the 118th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. She was ridden by Charlie Elliott, who won a coin toss with Fox for the right to have first choice of mount. She won by a head from Lady Marjorie (who appeared to be a somewhat unlucky loser after swerving in the final furlong) with Lindos Ojos a length away in third. Her victory earned her owner £8,854.
Four Course was stepped up in distance for the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 5 June and started at odds of 6/1. Ridden by Fox, she ran well and looked likely to win after taking the lead in the straight but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a length into second by the French-trained filly Brulette. The filly was dropped back in distance for the Falmouth Stakes at Newmarket in July and finished second to Pisa, to whom she was conceding fourteen pounds in weight. She was beaten in two subsequent races and retired from racing at the end of the year.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Four Course a "poor" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
Four Course was retired from racing to become a broodmare but died of tetanus at Cloghran Stud in Ireland before she produced any foals.

2018 Tokyo Marathon

The 2018 Tokyo Marathon () was the twelfth edition of the annual marathon race in Tokyo and was held on Sunday, 25 February. An IAAF Gold Label Road Race, it was the first World Marathon Majors event to be held that year. The men's race was won by Dickson Chumba in 2:05:30 hours while the women's race was won by Birhane Dibaba in 2:19:51. The men's runner-up Yuta Shitara set a Japanese national record time of 2:06:11 hours. This was also an Asian record. The host nation featured prominently in the men's race, with two runners in the top five and six of the top ten being Japanese. The Japanese women fared less well, with sixth-place Hiroko Yoshitomi being the best national performer (over ten minutes behind the winner).
Around 35,500 runners took part in the marathon races, with a further 500 taking part in a 10K run linked to the event. The public section of the race was oversubscribed 9 times over, with nearly 320,000 applications received. From an initial 35,911 starters, a total of 34,542 people finished the marathon distance, 7905 (23%) of which were women and 32 wheelchair racers. The event was broadcast live on television by Fuji TV and live radio commentary was provided by Nippon Broadcasting System. An exhibition about the race was held at Tokyo Big Sight in the three days proceeding the race.
Race summary.
Though the men's race was not as fast as the previous year, Chumba won the race in the second fastest time ever recorded at the event. Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich returned to attempt a title defence, and also a world record, but this proved too much for the athlete, who dropped out shortly after the 15 km mark. The leading men's group were paced through to the halfway point in 1:02:44. After the pacemakers dropped out, Chumba forged ahead with fellow Kenyans Amos Kipruto and Gideon Kipketer, though the latter two soon fell behind and Yuta Shitara had a late surge to overhaul them. After those four, Hiroto Inoue was the only other man to finish under two hours and seven minutes in fifth place – this was a new record in depth of performances at the race. Shitara's national record brought him a 100 million yen bonus (US$950,000) from the Japan Corporate Track and Field Federation as part of their "Project Exceed" initiative to improve performances in the build-up to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Inoue's sub-2:07 run was also worth a 10 million yen bonus.
The standard of the women's race was diminished by the absence of two major runners due to injury, Purity Cherotich Rionoripo and Meseret Defar. The gap in quality showed as five runners had build up a half minute lead by the first 5 km point – Ethiopians Birhane Dibaba, Ruti Aga and Shure Demise, plus American Amy Cragg and Kenya's Helah Kiprop. Kiprop drifted off the pack after 15 km, being 14 seconds in arrears when the other four women passed the halfway point in 1:10:19. Shure Demise was the next to go, falling behind by six seconds in the 25–30 km period of the race. The 30–35 km segment saw Cragg drop eight seconds back and Birhane Dibaba put clear distance between herself and runner-up Ruti Aga, eventually winning with nearly a minute and a half to spare.
In the wheelchair races, Hiroyuki Yamamoto and Tomoki Suzuki were dominant in the absence of Marcel Hug (flight cancellation) and it was Yamamoto who pipped his opponent to take the victory by a margin of one second in 1:26:23. A group of six racers remained in a pack further back, racing tactically some five minutes in arrears to the leaders. A sprint finish between them saw South Africa's Ernst van Dyk edge out Australian Kurt Fearnley by a fraction of a second to take third place. Six was the total number of entrants in the women's wheelchair race: Swiss Manuela Schär led the pace and pulled away from Tatyana McFadden and Amanda McGrory to win in 1:43:25 – over a minute and a half clear. McFadden took the runner-up spot and home athlete Tsubasa Kina pulled ahead of a fading McGrory to claim third.

Spiro Kosturi

Spiro Jovan Kosturi (? – 11 November 1906), also known as Spiro Kosturi, was a prominent figure involved in the Albanian National Awakening.
Spiro Kosturi was the son of Jovan Kosturi, a figure in the Albanian national movement. Kosturi was one of four trustees of the boys school in Korçë and in 1903 Ottoman authorities concerned with Albanian education and national sentiments arrested and exiled him to Salonica. In 1906, Greek bishop Photios was assassinated by an Albanian guerilla band and some months after the event Greeks retaliated by assassinating Kosturi in Salonica. The death of Kosturi impacted the Albanian national movement that resulted in meetings being held, resolutions passed and the diaspora press like "Kombi" in Boston and "Drita" in Sofia attempted to arouse national sentiments. Kosturi was considered a martyr for the national movement in Albanian circles and toward the fight against Greeks.
Kosturi was also the brother of Idhomene Kosturi, an Albanian politician, regent and once acting Prime Minister of Albania.

Charles Didier Dreux

Charles Didier Dreux (May 11, 1832 – July 5, 1861) was the first Confederate field officer killed during the Civil War. He was the son of Guy Dreux and Léontine Arnoult. Prior to the Civil War, Dreux had served as district attorney and a member of the Louisiana state legislature. 30,000 mourners attended his funeral in New Orleans. He is buried in Metairie Cemetery.
Tributes.
According to Grace King, those who knew him described him "as a man of great personal magnetism; brilliant, eloquent, dashing." He left for the battlefield as Lieutenant Colonel of the Louisiana Guard Battalion, in command of Dreux's (1st) Battalion, composed of the first five companies that volunteered from Louisiana. Three months later, he died at Young's Mill (Warwick, Virginia, now Newport News, Virginia) while on a failed mission to capture Union officers who often ate breakfast at Smith's Farm. His last words were "Steady, boys! Steady!”
An "Elegy on the Death of Lt. Col. Chas. Dreux", words by James R. Randall and music by G. M. Loening, was published in New Orleans in 1861.
Monument.
A monument to Dreux is located in New Orleans at the intersection of Canal Street and South Jefferson Davis Parkway. The text on the monument reads:
Vandalism to the statue includes having its nose was chiseled off in 2017, being covered in a white hood and spray-painted with obscenities in 2018, and being pulled down in 2020.

Sibidiena gens

The gens Sibidiena, sometimes written Sabidiena, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens attained any of the higher offices of the Roman state, but several are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Sibidienus" belongs to a class of names ending in "-enus", typically derived from other gentilicia, or sometimes from cognomina. "Sibidienus" would seem to be derived from "Sabidius", or perhaps from its derivative, "Sabidianus". Gentilicia of this type were common in Umbria and Picenum, and in fact most of the Sibidieni known from inscriptions seem to have lived at or near Tuficum in Umbria, from which it appears that the Sibidieni may have been of Umbrian origin, although the surname "Sabinus" borne by some of the family suggest that they may have been Sabines.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Sibidieni were "Lucius" and "Gaius", the two most common names throughout all periods of Roman history. It also appears that the Sibidieni at one time used "Spurius", a praenomen that had been common in Republican times, but which had become increasingly scarce, and finally disappeared under the early Empire.
Branches and cognomina.
The only distinct family of the Sibidieni lived at Tuficum in Umbria, but they do not appear to have been divided into separate branches. "Sabinus", the only surname known to have been passed down among the Sibidieni, belongs to a class of cognomina typically indicating the place of origin of an individual or family, and suggests that the Sabidieni either were, or claimed descent from the Sabines. "Maximus", borne by one or two of the family, was typically given to an eldest son, or bestowed on someone who had earned great honor or distinction. "Scaeva", borne by an ancestor of the Sabini, originally designated someone who was left-handed, but could also refer to someone particularly lucky, or unlucky.

Ponerorchis farreri

Ponerorchis farreri is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native from south-east Tibet to south-central China (north-west Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1924 by Rudolf Schlechter, as "Amitostigma farreri". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Amitostigma" and "Neottianthe" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with "Amitostigma farreri" becoming "Ponerorchis farreri".

Emma May Martin

Emma May Martin (January 3, 1865- February 10, 1957) was a Canadian artist best known for her work in watercolor, primarily depicting landscapes and still life scenes. Martin also occasionally worked in oil and china painting.
Born on January 3, 1865 in Toronto Ontario, Martin began her training with her father, Thomas Mower Martin. Martin later studied at the Toronto Art School under Marmaduke Matthews and George Reid. Martin began exhibiting in 1883, and would continue to show her work for the next sixty years. A member of the Ontario Society of Artists, Martin also had a long teaching career, particularly in the field of watercolor.
Early life.
Emma May Martin was born on January 3, 1865 in Toronto, Ontario. Her father, Thomas Mower Martin, was a well-known landscape painter, and her mother, Emma Nichols Martin raised nine children, of which Martin was the eldest. The five daughters and four sons of the Martin family were all involved in the arts as children, through exposure to music, painting and writing in their home. Martin and siblings had private tutors as children, and therefore did not partake in any public schooling.
Training.
Thomas Mower Martin is credited with introducing his daughter to painting and facilitating her early training. It is noted that he taught her the rudiments of paintings in 1876 and was her teacher until she attended the Toronto Art School, where she studied under Marmaduke Matthews and George Reid.
Artistic career.
Martin began exhibiting watercolors in 1883. By 1886 Martin was successfully entering in all of the major Canadian art shows. She exhibited with the Art Association of Montreal from 1885-1915, the Toronto Industrial Exhibition (later known as the Canadian National Exhibition) from 1890-1897, and the Royal Canadian Academy from 1887-1913. Martin was voted into membership with the Ontario Society of Artists in 1889 and exhibited with the group from 1885-1925. Martin's work "Late Twilight" was exhibited at the Chicago World's Fair in 1893.
Due to exhibition records hundreds of Martin's works have been named, however scant first-hand documentation is available. Martin worked primarily in watercolor, choosing to depict mostly landscape and still life scenes. There are notes of her completion of one or two oil paintings, however these are not traceable. A few china painting examples have been found.
Nearly all of Martin's works are signed, making attribution easier. She did not commonly date her works, therefore making it difficult to track her progression. Martin would paint various images of the same area and title them similarly, making it difficult to track the exact number of her works- an example being four separate yet very similar paintings were made of the Ontonabee River. Martin would also hold works back from exhibition for years after they were complete, which has created more difficulties when trying to establish a chronological timeline of her existing works.
Technique.
Martin's technique noticeably changed as her career progressed. In her earlier years she favored still life scenes and floral depictions. Her scenes were filled with bright colors and defined details. Further into her career she started to prefer landscape scenes, with her later paintings containing a unique, blurred softness. This technique may have been achieved with the use of a sponge. Martin preferred to work on off-white paper laid down on a board, and would typically outline her images in graphite before applying paint.
Martin stressed the importance of viewing nature first hand when painting it, insisting on travelling to the locations she wished to paint. She would spend large amounts of time studying specific natural elements to recreate them in her paintings. Martin commonly painted flowers and trees from her personal garden, allowing her unrestrained access to her subject matter. 
Critical Reception.
Early critiques of Martin's work in contemporary newspapers judge the artists work mainly in accordance to her father and his successes. In the early portion of her career her works are not typically mentioned by name in reviews, the consensus being that her father can be proud of her work, and her ability to carry on the family legacy. As Martin's career progressed, she started to be viewed as a separate artist, with her works acknowledged by name in newspaper articles and exhibition reviews.
Martin's work was viewed positively for the most part. Her works were lauded for their use of color and general treatment. Her drawing skills and use of light were also viewed as strengths.
Martin also received some negative critiques. It is noted that some reviewers believed she had difficulties with composition, therefore creating crowded scenes.
Teaching career.
Alongside painting, Martin had a long teaching career. She taught painting at the Presbyterian Ladies' College in Toronto from 1889-1910. There is potential she taught classes at the Rosedale League Art School as well. Martin did teach private lessons in her own studio, as well as outdoor sketching classes, for the majority of her career.
Personal life.
Martin never married. She lived in Toronto for much of her life, first helping raise her siblings, and later her nieces and nephews. After her mother's death in 1911 she also assumed care for her aging father. These familial commitments left her little time to paint.
Martin was comfortably wealthy throughout her life due to her family's position, and therefore never had to work or rely on the sales of her artwork for livelihood. This meant that Martin only painted when the urge struck, and she had the time. Martin treated her art solely as a hobby, even during her later periods of success.
Martin loved to travel and was a member of the Rosedale Travel Club. She commonly travelled through Ontario and Quebec to paint, as well as occasionally branching out to other parts of Canada. She was particularly fond of painting the Muskoka District, as well as Quebec's Eastern Township. She took two documented trips to Europe, one to England and Scotland with Thomas Mower Martin in 1906, and one on her own to England in 1925. The former trip produced many works, which were exhibited between the years of 1912 and 1928.
Martin's main passion besides painting was gardening, and she was a member of Toronto's Horticultural Association. Martin was also a member of the New Jerusalem Church and the Canadian Authors Association. Some sonnets and poems of the artists do exist today.
Later Life and Death.
Martin continued to exhibit works until 1943, when she was in her mid-seventies. After she retired from painting she spent much of her time gardening and researching her family genealogy. Martin's health began to fail in the 1950s, at which time she moved to Montreal, Quebec to live with one of her younger sisters. Martin died in Montreal on February 10, 1957 at the age of 92.
Legacy.
Today, Martin's remaining traceable works mainly reside in private collections. One work, "Summer Landscape with Geese," is in the public collection at the Art Gallery of Windsor. It is unclear which of Martin's oeuvre remain due to their location.
One posthumous solo exhibition, "Water Colours by E. May Martin", was presented at the Robert McLaughlin Gallery in Oshawa, 1980. This continues today to be the only known show solely consisting of Martin's works.

Anne Kahane

Anne Kahane (born 1 March 1924) is a Canadian artist. Best known for her figures carved in wood, Kahane began her career as a printmaker and commercial artist.
Early life.
Kahane was born in Vienna, Austria March 1, 1924. In 1925, she and her family moved to Canada, and settled in Montreal. In Montreal, Kahane attended high school at Strathcona Academy where no art course was taught. The absence of these studies influenced her to seek extra-curricular activities related to art.
Upon enrolling in night classes at the École des Beaux-Arts in Montreal (1940), she furthered her studies in traditional sculpture, commercial art, industrial design, and architecture. In the fall of 1942 Kahane began training as a commercial artist at Valentine's School of Commercial Art. She was part of a 2-year intensive program while also working at a commercial engraver's studio.
Kahane lived with her mother, using the home of her friends as studio space, and obtained planks of wood for her art from the local lumberyard.
In 1945 she went to New York to study at the Cooper Union Art School. It was there that she discovered the art of woodcarving, the technique that would later shape her career.
Career.
Emerging Recognition.
In 1953, Kahane's maquette for "The Unknown Political Prisoner Monument" was the only Canadian entry to take a prize in the international sculpture competition organized by the Institute of Contemporary Arts of London, England. In the same year, Kahane had her first solo exhibition at the Galérie Agnès Lefort. She received no financial prize from her London competition, but as a result, in 1952, was asked to join the Sculptors Society of Canada. At the 1956 Concours Artistique de la province au Quebec, Kahane won the grand prize for her work "Ball Game". As an associate member of the Royal Canadian Academy, Kahane exhibited with them between 1964 and 1976, and with the Art Association of Montreal from 1957 to 1965.
Mature Artist.
Kahane received public and private commissions, notably her sculpture for the Winnipeg airport (1963) and a piece for Montreal's Place des Arts (1963–1964). Her work was internationally celebrated, representing Canada with James Wilson Morrice, Jacques de Tonnancour, and Jack Nichols at the Canadian Pavilion at the Venice Biennale (1958), at Expo 67 in Montreal and at the Brussels World's Fair (1968).
She taught fine arts at Concordia University from 1965 to 1980. Later, as a resident sculptor, she taught at McMaster University in Hamilton (1980–1982), where she explored flat structural techniques using flexible materials to depart from traditional three-dimensional structures.
Media.
In addition to her work in sculpting using wood, brass, and aluminum, Kahane's artistic repertoire also included drawing and printmaking.

Wilhelmina Alexander (artist)

Wilhelmina "Mina" Alexander (July 2, 1871 – November 7, 1961) was a Canadian oil painter and philanthropist from Hamilton, Ontario. Alexander's painting consists primarily of landscapes, still-life scenes, and studies of nature both aquatic and land based. She has exhibited at the Royal Canadian Academy, the Women's International Exhibition (Detroit), and the Art Association of Montreal between 1929 and 1935. Prior to this, she served as president of the Women's Art Association of Canada, in her hometown of Hamilton. Despite Alexander's brief tenure as president, she remained involved with the association for many decades. In 1953, Alexander was involved in the decision to create a new art gallery in Hamilton. Alexander also took to supporting young artists by allowing them to hang their work alongside hers in exhibitions held in her home. Her painting style has been described as colourful and vibrant, especially with respect to her depictions of flowers for which she is most well-known. An influential figure in the Southern Ontario art world in the early-to-mid 1900s, archives of her life and work can be found through the Women's Art Association of Hamilton, as well as through the Canadian Women's Artist History Initiative.
Early life and education.
Wilhelmina Alexander was born in Hamilton, Ontario, on July 2, 1871. She lived at 176 Hughson Street South in Hamilton. Alexander studied at the Hamilton Art School under John Ireland, John Gordon, and "Miss Howell". She later studied privately under G. Horne Russell in Montreal, Quebec.
Artistic career.
Alexander's painting style has been described as being akin to the Impressionist movement, and the Canadian Group of Seven Artists (particularly that of Tom Thomson). Her work is known for its vibrant use of colors. While she is most well known for her floral scenes, she has also painted landscapes, still-life scenes, and landscape scenes depicting water. Most of her landscape paintings depict places in Southern Ontario such as the Georgian Bay and the Muskoka Lakes regions. However, she has also painted scenes from England, South Carolina, and Bermuda.
Her floral scenes have garnered her the most attention out of all of her paintings. On three separate occasions, she exhibited her floral scenes in Toronto and Montreal through the Royal Canadian Academy. Her participation in the annual exhibitions held at the Art Gallery of Hamilton was predominantly made up of these floral scenes. Among those exhibited include her "Bowl of Zinnias", "July Garden", "Phyllis and Bittersweet", "Canterbury Bells", and "Pom-Pom Zinnias".
Affiliation and recognition.
Throughout her life, Alexander was involved in a number of associations. As an attendee to its inaugural meeting in 1894, Alexander was involved with the Women's Art Association in Hamilton for more than five decades. In 1914, she was involved with a citizen committee to organize a new art gallery in Hamilton (formerly known as the Women's Committee of the Art Gallery of Hamilton). She served as president of the Women's Art Association from 1925 to 1928. During its brief lifetime, Alexander presided over the Hamilton Art Association as a trustee from 1935 to 1942, after which the association dissolved. In 1953, Alexander was heavily involved in the creation of a new site for the Hamilton Art Gallery on Forsythe and Main Street West. As a tribute for her continued support, Alexander was allotted the right to 'turn the first sod' on the new grounds. In 1951, Alexander received the Woman Citizen of the Year Award.
Alexander has exhibited with a number of distinguished institutions, including the Royal Canadian Academy in Toronto; Ontario and Montreal, Quebec; the Art Gallery of Hamilton, Ontario; and the Women's International Exhibition in Detroit by invitation.
Philanthropy.
In 1911, Alexander organized a 'tag day', in which she collected money from passers-by and gave them a tag to represent where their donations were given. All of the proceeds went to the Young Women's Christian Association.
For much of her career, Alexander was involved in developing the careers of other local artists. Throughout the 1930s, she used her home on Hughson Street South as an exhibition space for young artists. Among the invitees for these events were more than 200 citizens of Hamilton. In the 1940s, she utilized her home as an exhibition space to raise money for the war effort. She continued to use her house afterwards as a gallery to raise money for the Art Gallery of Hamilton.
Death and legacy.
Wilhelmina Alexander died in St. Peter's Infirmary in Hamilton, Ontario, on November 7, 1961, in which she reached 90 years of age. In many pieces of literature, Alexander is documented under a few different names including: Mina Alexander, Wilhelmina Towers Alexander, and Mrs. S. H. Alexander. Alexander is still recognized by the city of Hamilton as a contributor to the art scene in the early-to-mid 20th century. Her art can be seen today in the Hamilton Art Gallery. Prior to her death the Women's Art Association in Hamilton recognized her as an honourary president and life member.

Kay Kinsman

Katherine Nixon Bell (June 27, 1909 - 1998), known as Kay Kinsman, was an artist, writer and student of history and languages. She is noted for her works created with watercolour orin pen and ink depicting street views and everyday life. As an artist and writer, Kinsman published three sketchbooks and her works were also exhibited in England and Quebec. 
Kinsman was born in Los Angeles, and her father died before her birth. After her mother's death at age 9, Kinsman lived with her grandmother in Cuba, schooling in Jamaica. Throughout her life, Kinsman spent time abroad studying in Paris, living in Switzerland and England, and spent her final years living and studying in Quebec, Canada. 
At the age of 89, Kinsman died at her final home of Sherbrooke, Quebec. Kinsman spent the last two decades of her life focusing on her academic life studying art, history, languages, drama and classics at Bishop's University, Sherbrooke. Kinsman accepted numerous degrees including a master's degree from McGill University and multiple bachelor's degrees from Bishop's University where she spent a significant portion of her later-life. After her death, various drawings and materials used by Kinsman were donated to the Archives Department of the Eastern Townships Resource Centre, Sherbrooke
Early life.
Kinsman was born in Los Angeles on June 27, 1909. Prior to her birth, Kinsman's father died of typhus. After his death, Kinsman and her mother spent time living in Mexico, where her grandfather worked on a railway. After her grandfather's imprisonment during the revolution, in 1911, Kinsman and her mother fled back to the United States. There is a story about how Kinsman, aged four, was expelled from a convent school in Texas after she drew a priest sitting on a bathroom toilet. After Kinsman's mother remarried, the family moved to Cuba while Kinsman spent her elementary years in school in Jamaica. While visiting her daughter in Jamaica, Kinsman's mother died. Kinsman was nine years old. Once graduated and living in Cuba, Kinsman started working as a junior reporter of the Havana Times, although she soon left the position to study fine art abroad.
Education and career.
Paris.
After receiving an inheritance in 1930 and leaving the reporting job at the Havana Times, Kinsman travelled to study at the Parson's School of Fine and Applied Art in Paris, France. Afterward, Kinsman also studied in at L’Ecole Ozenfant under Amédée Ozenfant.
Montreal, Quebec.
After Kinsman's first move to Montreal with her husband and children, Kinsman continued her studies of fine arts at the Montreal Museum School of Fine Arts from 1945 to 1949 while painting and raising her children. There, Kinsman studied under Anne Savage and Dr. Arthur Lismer. Kinsman's works created in Montreal illustrate her "interest in the city." She was described in the Montreal Star: "Kay Kinsman waits for a sunny day without much wind. Then she bundles together her watercolours and sets off by bus from her Cote des Neiges apartment to the foot of McGill Street where she explores along St. Paul to St. Gabriel, or Bonsecours, in search of something worth preserving." At the age of 57, Kinsman had earned her diploma in piano from the Royal Toronto Conservatory of Music. In 1967, Kinsman published her "Montreal Sketchbook" to mark the Canadian Centennial.
England.
In 1972, after her husband's death, Kinsman left Canada to live in England and be closer to her family. There, she lived in the Cotswolds village of Broadway. She also lived in the village of Pershore. There, Kinsman created works "High Street Broadway" and "Pershore Abbey," now in the Archives Department of the Eastern Townships Resource Centre in Sherbrooke, Quebec. Also in the collection is her "The Bells of Paradise," an essay describing her time in Pershore. In England, Kinsman's work was displayed at multiple solo exhibitions in both Pershore and Malvern as well as in a group exhibition at the Royal Watercolour Society and Royal Academy of Graphic Artists in London. Kinsman's time in Broadway influenced her publication of "Broadway Sketchbook," a compilation of scenes from her time there, including depictions of village people whom she "mocked a little." Her works created in Broadway, specifically one of her old stone house, show what Franck Les Tyrs called Kinsman's "magical ability to capture light and mood."
Lennoxville, Quebec.
The last seventeen years of Kinsman's life were dedicated to studying and creating artworks, essays, and other publications in Lennoxville, Quebec. In the 1980s at the age of 71, Kinsman returned to Quebec, Canada from England. Settling in Lennoxville, Kinsman continued to study fine arts and additionally languages, music history and British history as a special undergraduate student. After a full career of creating art, Kinsman enrolled in a BA Fine Arts program at Bishop's University in Sherbrooke, Quebec. It is quoted that Kinsman was "sidetracked" into other subjects such as languages, history, and music. In the end, Kinsman graduated with a BA in liberal arts, accepting the degree in 1983.
The summer after her graduation, Kinsman travelled to Santiago de Compostela, following the famous pilgrimage route across Spain. Kinsman's experiences from that trip were later recounted in a lecture "The Way to Compostela" later that same year at Bishop's University, as well as in French at the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Sherbrooke.
In 1983, Kinsman reapplied to Bishop's University as a special undergraduate, now for the second time, taking history, classics, and language courses. Kinsman also began a masters of English from McGill University. Kinsman's thesis was centred around medieval studies, particularly about the canon "Sumer is icumen in," "as she wished to prove, by John of Fornsett." Kinsman was awarded the MA from McGill University in 1987 at the age of 78. Afterwards, Kinsman continued studies at Bishop's University, leading to a second BA in classics, achieved in 1989. At the same ceremony, Kinsman was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bishop's University (DCL Honoris Causa). Kinsman's final class was taken in 1996 at the age of 86. Through these years of Kinsman's studies, "her artistic career continued with great vigour," as she travelled to Europe during the summers, bringing back new works.
Artistic Output.
Kinsman spent her lifetime working with watercolour, pen, and ink. The subject matter of many of her works, especially later in her life, were scenes of streets, buildings, nature, and people caught in moments of daily life. Kinsman's works provided a quick glimpse but included detail such as words on a sign or a pigeon in a street. Kinsman's style differs from that of her first teacher, Amédée Ozenfant, whose style was primarily cubist. Kinsman's work is more comparable to those of her other mentors, Dr. Arthur Lismer and Anne Savage, both known for depicting scenes of nature.
Kinsman published three sketchbooks in her lifetime: Montreal Sketchbook (1967), Broadway Sketchbook (1974), and Lennox Sketchbook (1990). As part of her master's degree from McGill University, Kinsman published a work entitled "Sing cuccu nu." Kinsman's work was displayed in numerous solo and group exhibitions in Quebec and in various locations in England. A full list of exhibitions are detailed below.
Personal life and death.
Kinsman was married to Ronald Desmond Lewis Kinsman in 1932. The two met in Paris while Kinsman studied fine art. From there, the couple moved to Switzerland for her husband's business, then to New York City, and finally to Montreal. She "loved her children." She had three children: Michael Jon (who died in 1986), Jocelyn, and Jeremy. After her husband's death in 1965, Kinsman travelled back to England, where she spent time creating art depicting scenes of daily life and quiet streets. Once back in Canada, Kinsman spent the rest of her life fulfilling her love of learning in (Lennoxville) Sherbrooke, Quebec at Bishop's University. At the age of 89, Kinsman died of Pneumonia in Lennoxville, Quebec.
Legacy.
Kinsman's works are currently located in various private collections around the world including the Rothchild Collection (Montreal), the R. Martindale Collection (Marbella, Spain), the Stratford-upon-Avon Gallery in England, and the Musée des beaux-arts de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, Quebec. After her death, drawings and materials used by Kinsman were donated to the Archives Department of the Eastern Townships Resource Centre, Sherbrooke, Quebec, including copies of each published sketchbook.

Ikayukta Tunnillie

Ikayukta Tunnillie (also known as Tunnillie Tunnillie, Ikajukta Tunnillie, Ekayutaq Tunnillie, 1911–1980) was an Inuit artist in the fields of printmaking and drawing. Tunnillie was born in Nunavut and traveled for much of her life. Tunnillie's work in drawing and printmaking focused on animals and life in the North. She was one of the oldest printmakers to work with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative.
Early life.
Tunnillie's exact birth date is unknown, which is typical of that time in Nunavut. She was born somewhere near Frobisher Bay, Nunavut in 1911.
Family life and traveling.
As a teen, Tunnillie was taken in by an older man named Iyola Tunili. Tunili already had a wife named Samalinga, but also wished to marry Ikayukta. The family lived in harmony together. The family included Tunili, his first wife Samalinga, their child, and Ikayukta. They spent many years on the move, traveling from Resolute Bay, to Clyde River, Pangnirtung, Netiling Lake and finally to Cape Dorset. They lived in skin tents which they made and traveled by dogsled. As a young woman, Tunnillie traveled on the Nascopie ship from the south Baffin area to the Arctic Bay and the north Baffin coast. Tunnillie's first child was born aboard the Nascopie. After Iyola died from a respiratory infection, Tunnillie continued to travel with her second husband, Nungusweetuk. Tunnillie only settled in Cape Dorset in 1970, at the age of 59.
Career.
Tunnillie began printmaking with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative, which was a craft center and co-op store that formed in 1959. The co-op was instrumental in bringing stonecut image art to the area. The practice was brought to the co-op by James Houston, who spent four months in Japan studying the art form. The Hudson's Bay company and the Canadian Guild of Crafts provided supplies for the co-op. Tunnillie's daughter Kakulu, who became a successful artist herself, began drawing before Ikayukta. Kakulu encouraged her mother to start drawing while Tunnillie was living in Aqiatalaulavik with her son. Her work was first exhibited in the 1971 Cape Dorset Annual Collection, and she was one of only 14 artists featured in the collection. Tunnillie also found financial empowerment through her artwork. In an interview with the Cape Dorset Collection, she recalled carrying her art to the co-op to sell it. Tunnillie remarked, "I get pleasure out of drawing when I feel like it. And also when there is not enough money to buy food I know that I can help [my family] by selling some drawings. When I notice that there is something missing or that my family doesn't have enough food for the weekend or the week, that's when I draw – and also, when I feel like drawing, that's when I draw". Selling drawings to the co-op was Tunnillie's only source of income. Tunnillie was very humble about her work, stating in the Dorset Annual Collection of 1980, "Even though I can't really draw well, it's fortunate that they put my prints in a book like this – even through I can't draw like the others do.
Tunnillie's work was featured in exhibits at:
Solo Collections:
Featured artist:
1978 Cape Dorset Annual Collection
Later life.
Tunnillie became a mother to two children, Qavaroak in 1928 and Kakulu in 1940. She also became a grandmother and was widowed sometime before 1975. In 1980, the Cape Dorset Collection reported that she was house ridden because of painful joints. At that time she was living with her grandson and his family. Her last contribution to an exhibit was as part of the 21st annual Cape Dorset collection in 1980. She died that year in Cape Dorset as one of the oldest printmakers in the community.

Elise L'Heureux

Elise L’Heureux (January 22, 1827 — January 1896), was a photographer from Quebec City, Quebec. L’Heureux's work was prominent during the Victorian Era. At that time, art moved towards romanticism and mysticism in connection with social values and the arts.
The photographers during the Victorian Era came primarily from Europe or trained there. This resulted in a European influence on Canadian photography. Her initial artistic focus was on portraits, typically on children, for which she became known. She expanded to include calling cards and landscapes. L’Heureux contributed to documentary photography in the 19th century through her photos of residents and landscapes of Quebec. She managed her own photography company after the death of her husband.
Early life.
Elise L’Heureux married Jules Isaie Benoit dit Livernois in 1849 and established their daguerreotype studio in 1854 in the home of L'Heureux's parents. This business later expanded to include three studios specializing in portraits. She took over the business after Livernois died of tuberculosis in 1865. A year later she partnered with her son-in-law Louis Bienvenu, creating The Livernois and Bienvenu photography studio.
L’Heureux gave birth to a son Jules Ernest Benoit dit Livernois on August 19, 1851. In Saint-Zéphirin-de-Courval, Quebec. He followed his parent's footsteps, traveling throughout Quebec taking landscapes photos and outdoor group portraits. In 1989, he was one of four 19th-century photographers to be commemorated with a Canadian postage stamp.
Career.
L’Heureux specialized in portraits of children from 1857 to 1858. The business expanded to include three studios, after the partnership with Bienvenu, the business expanded to include calling cards and landscapes in addition to portraits. Many of the studio's works are now owned by the MuséNationale des Beaux-arts du Québec.
The studio had its works featured in "L’Opinion Publique" and in "Canadian Illustrated News". The partnership with Bienvenu was dissolved in April 1873. Jules Livernois, took over the studio until 1952 when the studio went bankrupt in 1979.
Photographic techniques.
L’Heureux employed various photographic techniques including daguerrotype and collodion, or "wet-plate", process and stereoscopy. She added colour with aquatint and oil mediums.
Death.
L’Heureux died in Quebec City, Quebec, in January 1896. The Livernois family continued to be memorialized in a place named Quebec.

Paris Métro entrances by Hector Guimard

Between 1900 and 1913, Hector Guimard was responsible for the first generation of entrances to the underground stations of the Paris Métro. His Art Nouveau designs in cast iron and glass dating mostly to 1900, and the associated lettering that he also designed, created what became known as the Métro style ("style Métro") and popularized Art Nouveau. However, arbiters of style were scandalized and the public was also less enamored of his more elaborate entrances. In 1904 his design for the Opéra station at Place de l'Opéra was rejected and his association with the Métro ended; many of his station entrances have been demolished, including all three of the pavilion type (at Bastille and on Avenue de Wagram at Étoile). Those that remain are now all protected historical monuments, one has been reconstituted, and some originals and replicas also survive outside France.
Construction and characteristics.
The initial network of the Paris Métropolitain (soon commonly abbreviated to "Métro") was planned and built at one time in order to minimize disruption to the city from on-going construction and to open Line 1 and two branches in time for the Exposition Universelle in 1900. A design competition was held for the above-ground components, to alleviate the public's fear that they would mar the cityscape with an industrial appearance. The new entrances were stipulated to be "as elegant as possible but above all very light, prioritising iron, glass and ceramic". However, the submitted entries were all too bulky for many of the sidewalk sites. Adrien Bénard, the financier whose bank was underwriting the construction, liked the new Art Nouveau style and therefore instead persuaded the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (CMP) to appoint the still young Hector Guimard to design the entrances to the underground stations, while the elevated stations were designed by Jean-Camille Formigé, chief architect of the City of Paris.
Rather than stone, Guimard used cast iron set in concrete both to reduce costs and to suit the sinuous Art Nouveau forms; they were painted in a green emulating weathered brass. (For a renovation that began in 1999, the RATP, the Paris transportation authority, restored the entrances to two slightly different shades: at sites with a lot of vegetation, "vert wagon" ('train-car green'), the dark green used for Parisian public works at the turn of the 20th century, and at fully urban sites, a slightly bluer shade, "vert allemand" ('German green').) He designed standardized components, including railing cartouches incorporating the letter "M" and signs in his own distinctive lettering reading "Métropolitain" or, at narrow entrances, "Métro"; later the use of the lettering was extended to a holder for a system map and for advertising ("porte-plan") with the station name above. In addition to speed (the first set of entrances were installed within six months of their design) and relatively low cost in manufacture and adaptation to different sizes and locations of entrances, all of this gave the system a stylistic identity. 
Three of the entrances took the form of free-standing pavilions or small stations, including waiting rooms: one at Bastille and two on Avenue de Wagram at Étoile. These were in a style influenced by Japanese pagodas. At Étoile Guimard provided exterior doors for elevators, although the elevators were not built. Eight simpler but still elaborate structures, labeled "Édicule B" by Guimard, were installed at the termini of Line 1 as originally opened and at two other major stations. These consisted of three-sided glass-roofed structures enclosing the stairway, with a projecting canopy. A variation on this format, "Édicule A", lacked the canopy and was erected at two stations, Saint-Paul and Reuilly – Diderot. These "édicule" types of entrance, which have come to be called "libellules" because they resemble dragonflies, in some cases had decorated wall panels surfaced in reconstituted lava. The great majority of the entrances built (154) were unroofed enclosures, dubbed an "entourage". A transitional form between the "entourage" and the "édicule", railings with a roof and canopy, was used for one entrance at the Gare de Lyon métro station.
At many of the "entourages", the top of the steps is surmounted by a "Métropolitain" or "Métro" sign in a holder that extends between two risers in the form of sinuous stalks, traditionally compared to lily-of-the-valley, each bearing a light in the form of a red-orange globe reminiscent of an eye or a flower. These were not ready until 1901, the year after the system first opened, and Guimard varied the "Métropolitain" lettering somewhat between stations and twice revised the design, which reached its final form in 1902.
Reception and later history.
The Guimard entrances received a generally warm reception. Salvador Dalí later called them "those divine entrances to the Métro, by grace of which one can descend into the region of the subconscious of the living and monarchical aesthetic of tomorrow". By way of what became known as "le style Métro", they popularized Art Nouveau, which had been a style known largely to connoisseurs of the avant garde.
However, critics and many of the public were hostile to the "libellules" in particular, and criticized the green as "German" and the lettering as "un-French" and, according to critic André Hallays in "Le Temps", "confus[ing to] little children who are trying to learn their letters and ... stupefy[ing to] foreigners". On the Champs-Élysées, for example at Marbeuf (now part of Franklin D. Roosevelt), simple stone walls with discreet carved signage were used instead, and a plain design was also used at Bourse. Unhappiness with Guimard's 1904 design for the Opéra station, described in "Le Figaro" as having "contorted ramps" and "enormous frog-eye lamps", and increasing costs led to the CMP severing its relationship with him. The entrance at Opéra was instead designed by , in classical marble. The CMP bought Guimard's molds and rights and a total of 141 of his entrances were ultimately produced, the last in 1913.
The CMP continued in later years to replace some of Guimard's designs with more sober entrances by Cassien-Bernard, often a plain balustrade in white stone, for example at Gare de l'Est, Madeleine, Montparnasse, and Saint-François-Xavier. Modernization beginning after World War I also led to the demolition of many, especially the more elaborate. Shortly before World War II, it was suggested that those remaining should be scrapped for their metal. Art Nouveau had only briefly been in fashion and only became popular once more in the last quarter of the 20th century.
Entrances extant today.
Ninety-one Guimard entrances survived until 1970. Eighty-six are still extant and protected as historical monuments; six were protected in 1965, the remainder in 1978. These include two original Type B "édicules": at Porte Dauphine, on its original site and with the wall panels, and at Abbesses (moved from Hôtel de Ville in 1974). A third Type B of varying form at Châtelet is a 2000 recreation. The remainder of the preserved entrances are simple enclosures or "entourages", with or without the light and sign arch. In addition, two sides of an "entourage" form an entryway to the headquarters building of the RATP.
Guimard entrances elsewhere.
Some subway systems and museums outside France have examples of Guimard Métro entrances, mostly replicas presented by the RATP in exchange for art works.

2018–19 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship

The 2018-19 All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship was the 49th staging of the All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship, the Gaelic Athletic Association's premier inter-county club hurling tournament. The championship began on 28 October 2018 and ended on 17 March 2019.
Cuala of Dublin were the defending champions. They were eliminated by Kilmacud Crokes in the semi-final of the 2018 Dublin Championship.
On 17 March 2019, Ballyhale Shamrocks won the championship following a 2-28 to 2-11 defeat of St. Thomas's in the All-Ireland final. This was their seventh All-Ireland title overall and their first title since 2015.
Ballygunner's Pauric Mahony was the championship's top scorer with 1-42.
Competition Format.
County Championships
The top hurling teams in Ireland's counties compete in their senior club championship. Each county decides the format for determining their county champions – it can be knockout, double-elimination, league, etc or a combination.
Only single club teams are allowed to enter the All-Ireland Club championship. If a team which is an amalgamation of two or more clubs, a divisional team or a university team wins a county's championship, a single club team will represent that county in the provincial championship as determined by that county's championship rules. Normally it is the club team that exited the county championship at the highest stage.
Provincial Championships
Leinster, Munster and Ulster organise a provincial championship for their participating county champions. Connacht discontinued their senior club championship after 2007 but they do organise intermediate and junior championships. The Galway champions represent Connacht in the All-Ireland senior club semi-finals as Galway club hurling is at higher level than the hurling in the other four Connacht counties.
Some Leinster, Munster and Ulster counties also enter their senior champions in the All-Ireland intermediate club championship (tier 2) as it is recognised that club hurling is weak in those counties.
All matches are knock-out. Two ten minute periods of extra time are played each way if it's a draw at the end of normal time in all matches including the final. If the score is still level after extra time the match is replayed.
All-Ireland
The two semi-finals are usually played on a Saturday in early February. The All-Ireland final is traditionally played in Croke Park on St. Patrick's Day, the 17th of March.
All matches are knock-out. Two ten minute periods of extra time are played each way if it's a draw at the end of normal time in the semi-finals or final. If the score is still level after extra time the match is replayed.

Württemberg I

The Würtemberg I was a class of tender locomotives of the Royal Württemberg State Railways "(Königlich Württembergischen Staats-Eisenbahnen, K.W.St.E)". They were their first locomotives.
Development.
The three locomotives were of the 4-4-0 wheel arrangement and were manufactured by the Norris Locomotive Works in Philadelphia. They had a round-topped firebox, which sat between the two pairs of driving wheels. The two outside cylinders were mounted at front of the boiler, at the height of the front axle.
The open cab was level with the outer edge of the frame and was therefore rather narrow. The wheel arch for the rear driving wheels also protruded into the cab. The locomotives were rebuilt during their service lives and were withdrawn in 1861.

2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship Game

The 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Championship Game was the final game of the 2018 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament. The game was played on April 1, 2018, at the Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish defeated the Mississippi State Bulldogs to win their second national championship.
The game was won on a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 0.1 seconds left on the clock—she made a similar shot with 1.0 second in the semifinal to defeat Connecticut, earning Notre Dame a berth in the championship.
Participants.
Mississippi State.
The Mississippi State Bulldogs were led by sixth-year head coach Vic Schaefer. The Bulldogs opened their season by winning all 15 of their non-conference games, including three wins in the Cancún Challenge and two wins as a part of the Duel in the Desert (played in Paradise, Nevada), adding a win against the No. 9 Oregon Ducks. The Bulldogs entered SEC play ranked No. 5 in the nation, and never dropped below that ranking, as they finished the regular season 30–0, 16–0 in SEC play, including four wins over ranked conference opponents: No. 6 Tennessee, No. 15 Missouri, defending national champions No. 7 South Carolina, and No. 17 Texas A&amp;M. The Bulldogs were seeded first in the SEC tournament, where they defeated (9) Kentucky and (5) Texas A&amp;M en route to the championship game, where they fell to (2) South Carolina, 51–62 for their first loss of the season. The Bulldogs received an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament, where they were seeded first in the Kansas City regional. In the tournament, Mississippi State defeated (16) Nicholls State, (9) Oklahoma State, (4) NC State, and (3) UCLA en route to the Final Four, where they beat (1) Louisville in overtime, putting their record at 37–1.
Notre Dame.
The Notre Dame Fighting Irish were led by 31st-year head coach Muffet McGraw. The Fighting Irish opened their season by winning eleven of their first twelve games, including three wins in the Gulf Coast Showcase and a win in the ACC–Big Ten Women's Challenge, with three of those four being ranked opponents, most notably defending champions No. 3 South Carolina. The Irish suffered their first loss in their eighth game of the season, a matchup with No. 1 Connecticut in the Jimmy V Classic. Notre Dame entered ACC play 11–1, ranked No. 2 in the nation. The Irish performed exceptionally in conference, finishing the regular season 27–2, with fifteen wins from sixteen ACC games, including three wins against ranked conference opponents (No. 8 Florida State, No. 19 Duke, and No. 21 NC State) and one win against a ranked non-conference opponent (No. 8 Tennessee). The Irish's only other loss of the season came against No. 3 Louisville in their fifth conference game; Notre Dame finished the season having won their last twelve games and were seeded second in the ACC tournament, where they defeated (7) Virginia and (3) Florida State en route to the title game, where they once again fell to Louisville. The Irish were seeded first as an at-large bid in the NCAA Tournament's Spokane Regional. On their run to the title game, Notre Dame defeated (16) Cal State Northridge, (9) Villanova, (4) Texas A&amp;M, and (2) Oregon to get to the Final Four, where they faced and defeated (1) Connecticut in overtime via a made basket by Arike Ogunbowale with 1.0 seconds left.
The Irish reached this point despite a severely depleted roster with only seven scholarship players by the start of the NCAA tournament—four players missed part or all of the season to torn ACLs. Brianna Turner, an All-American forward in 2016–17, suffered the injury in the 2017 NCAA tournament and missed the entire season. Senior guard Mychael Johnson was lost in a preseason practice, freshman center Mikayla Vaughn after six games, and starting senior point guard Lili Thompson was lost on New Year's Eve. Before the title game, McGraw told media, "I didn't think we'd have more ACL tears than losses. I think it's just an amazing accomplishment for this team and the resilience they've shown all year."
Media coverage.
The Championship Game was televised in the United States by ESPN. Adam Amin gave the play-by-play, with Kara Lawson and Rebecca Lobo as the color analysts, and Holly Rowe as the sideline reporter. Maria Taylor, Lobo, Nell Fortner and Andy Landers provided studio coverage.

Giuliano Ghelli

Giuliano Ghelli (10 May 1944 – 15 February 2014) was an Italian painter who produced several series of works, each rooted in the practice of drawing. An autodidact, Ghelli's early influences were informalism and geometric abstraction, from which he developed a cartoon-like style of figuration inspired by pop art and Surrealism. Ghelli was said to draw on affect over intellect, working personal interests and relations, and, later, dreams into his pictures; the Italian word "racconto" (narrative or story) often appears in the artist's titles.
Debut and early work (1962-1978).
At age 17 Ghelli began to frequent the studios of several contemporary Florentine painters and soon met the avant-garde art dealer Fiamma Vigo (). Through Vigo's "Numero" gallery, Ghelli discovered a community of artists and writers who strongly influenced his approach to painting. Ghelli debuted in 1963 with two works on canvas in a group exhibition at Vigo's "Numero" gallery in Milan. He continued to exhibit his work in Vigo's galleries in Florence and Venice into the late 1960s.
In 1972 Ghelli signed a contract with the "Sangallo" gallery in Florence; the associated stipend allowed him to paint full-time.
"Il portapaesaggi" (The Landscape Carrier).
From 1973 Ghelli's works tended increasingly towards figuration, with crudely drawn elements of landscape (hills, patches of sky, a line of trees at the horizon), road signage, mechanical elements and humanoid-robot figures. In 1974 he published the pocket volume "Il portapaesaggi" with text by the contemporary art historian Lara-Vinca Masini.
In 1975 Ghelli's paintings were exhibited in New York and Los Angeles and in 1977 Ghelli returned to New York to exhibit his work and travel cross-country. Starting in 1978 Arezzo-based Novart produced a line of jewelry based on "Il portapaesaggi".
Sentiment and narrative (1980-1989).
From 1980 a "narrative dimension" emerged in Ghelli's prints and paintings. The sparsely-drawn hills, robots, and signage of the previous decade are joined by envelopes, houses, and the occasional hand-written phrase. In her text describing the paintings in Ghelli's 1983 Ferrara exhibition the critic Maria Luisa Frisa noted "The theme of romantic love ... in all its facets: desire, jealously, abandonment, distance. The interplay of narrative, landscape and technological artifact in Ghelli's work was commented by the art historian Lara-Vinca Masini in her 1989 "Arte Contemporanea", noting, in Ghelli's paintings, a "lucid, fable-like transcription of technology and robots."
Mature work (1990–2014).
Mechanical themes: Leonardo and Mercedes-Benz.
In 1990 Ghelli was introduced to the Leonardo scholar Carlo Pedretti, then professor of art history at UCLA. From meetings with Pedretti followed a set of silkscreens and then paintings inspired by Leonardo da Vinci, culminating in the 1992 exhibition "In viaggio con Leonardo" in Milan. Ghelli would continue to reference Leonardo's work, in particular the illustrations of the Codex Leicester, in several works from the 1990s onwards.
Ghelli's Leonardo paintings were noticed by Jochen Prange, the head of Mercedes-Benz Italia S.p.A., and led to a commission for twenty paintings for the company's new Rome headquarters, which hosted a one-man exhibition for the artist in 1995.
The "Aborigeni," "Migrazioni," and "Esercito di terracotta".
Many of Ghelli's canvases from the late 1990s are densely packed with color and form. In his text "Ghelli's 'Horror Vacui'", Carlo Pedretti characterized this period's style as "painting that does not allow empty space" linking it to the workings of the subconscious and dreams.
In 2000, a trip to Sydney, Australia and a reading of Bruce Chatwin's novel The Songlines led Ghelli to paint series of canvases referencing Aboriginal symbols and Dreamtime. In this same period the artist painted a series of works on paper and canvas depicting shoals of fish, each with the title "Migrazione". These series were cited by some critics as evidencing Ghelli's interest in dreams and in the ancestral and unchanging.
Ghelli's "Esercito di terracotta" (Terracotta Army) resulted from the artist extending his practice of painting fabric tailors busts to sculpting and decorating pre-fabricated, fresh clay forms. Through carving, stamping, and the application molded shapes, Ghelli created approximately fifty small terracotta female busts (each 25 cm high) soon followed by a larger series (about 75 cm high). Some journalists and public figures associated the work to the partially-excavated Terracotta Army of Xi'an.
The "Cantiere" and the "Segreti".
In 2011 the artist created an art lab for secondary school students called the "Cantiere Giuliano Ghelli" (Ghelli work site). Concurrently, Ghelli had been experimenting with twine wrapped around his pieces, one of which he brought into the art lab. Ghelli invited the students to "write on a small piece of canvas … a phrase no one would ever read". Each such piece was then "folded ... soaked in glue, placed under the twine and covered with paint." The resulting painted tailor's bust belongs to a series of mixed media works called "Segreti" (Secrets) made between 2011 and 2014.
Recognition.
1973: awarded a scholarship offered to young artists by the city of Florence.
1975: participated in the 10th edition of the "Quadriennale nazionale d'arte di Roma".
1975: included by noted critic Tommaso Paloscia () in Bolaffi Arte's annual listing of "top Italian artists".

2013: awarded the "Gonfalone d’argento", top honor of the "Consiglio Regionale della Toscana".
2013: named "Commendatore dell'Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana".

Katherine Wallis

Katherine Elizabeth Wallis (1861–1957) was a Canadian sculptor, a watercolor painter and poet. She traveled all over the world, observing art, studying sculpture and advancing her artistic career. Wallis is best known for bronze sculptures of animals and infants.
Biography.
Early life.
Katherine Wallis was born in 1861 outside of Peterborough, Ontario, in a small town called Merino. Although Wallis, and her sister Adah, grew up on a farm they were encouraged to pursue their art. Each member of the Wallis family was artistically gifted including her mother who enjoyed music and singing. Wallis role models were her mother's friends, including Catharine Parr Traill, her sister Susanna Moodie and the painter Anne Langton. For a brief time, Wallis attended the Toronto Art School known today as OCAD University, but in the late 1800s there were few options for women practicing art professionally. During this time, women were not permitted to take life drawing classes with nude models. Langton told the Wallis sisters, "If you wish to obtain your dream, you cannot stay here." At this early time, Katherine Wallis had not yet realized she was interested in sculpture, but she knew that opportunities for female artists in Canada were limited.
Scotland (1878–1880).
Wallis and her sister Sussanna traveled to Scotland to visit their family. She enrolled in the Edinburgh School of Arts in 1878. While at the Scottish National Gallery as a copyist, Wallis was able to earn a living making copies of famous art works. In 1880, Wallis's mother became ill and the sisters returned home to take care of the farm. After her stay in Canada and tending the family's farm for the next thirteen years, Katherine Wallis had the freedom and financial stability to return to Europe.
London (1893–1899).
At 32, Wallis returned to Europe with her sister Adah. They settled in Dresden, Germany, and spent two years travelling around Europe, viewing famous paintings, sculptures and architecture. In 1895, Katherine Wallis enrolled in the London's Royal College of Art, RCA. She was taught by French-born sculptor Édouard Lantéri, a former pupil of Jacques-Louis David. While working with Lantéri, Wallis realized her passion for sculpture. Lantéri also taught her in "New Sculpture", which consisted of small scale bronzes of domestic subjects, including women and small animals. While studying at the RCA School of Design, she was awarded the RCA Bronze Medal. In 1897, Wallis received the Modeller's Free Scholarship, which allowed her to continue her studies for two more years until she decided to move to Paris.
Paris (1899–1939).
In Paris, Wallis focused on creating sculpture. Specifically, she enjoyed sculpting animals she observed at the Zoo. She met Oscar Waldmann in Paris at Jardin des plantes, which functions as a modern-day zoo. He encouraged her to submit one of her sculptures at the Exposition Universalle, which added to the recognition of her art. Wallis also exhibited her work at the spring salon in Paris. At this time, Wallis was studying animals and sculpting them into stone, marble and bronze. Notably, Wallis met Auguste Rodin in 1902. He encouraged her to sketch sculptures she saw at the Louvre. Rodin praised her figures' solid construction. Rodin wanted to see more of her work, but Wallis declined because her work was too hard to transport for his viewing, and because she already had great mentors like Lantéri and Waldmann. In 1914, when World War I broke out, Wallis did not continue sculpting, but focused on the war efforts as a nurse in a Canadian Hospital in Paris. Her art was meant to be exhibited at the Canadian National Exhibition in Toronto, but due to the war, it was postponed. Once World War I ended, Wallis returned to her artistic career. In 1929, she became the first Canadian elected as the Sociétaire of the Société National des Beaux-Arts for her sculpture "La Lutte Pour la Vie". In 1920, she spent three years exhibiting works in Peterborough, Ontario, before she returned to Paris. She also spent five months in Bosnia and Greece, working in relief and water colour. She sent her works to England and within one year she exhibited her sculptures in London, Liverpool, Leeds and Glasglow. In 1936, when World War II broke out, she fled to California, which became her home for the rest of her life.
Santa Cruz (1939–1957).
The Santa Cruz Art League offered Wallis a personal exhibition, which she accepted. Wallis had a statewide show in the Santa Cruz Auditorium. Wallis was made a member of the National Society for Sanity in Art, which allowed her to exhibit once a year in San Francisco and Chicago. Through this society, she received a prize for Excellence in Sculpture, an award she won twice. In 1944, Wallis showed her sculptures "Coming Always Nearer" and "Speed" at the Santa Cruz Art League's Fifteenth Annual Exhibition. Later that year, she created a piece called "Victory"; a woman who smiles as she carries a dove while holding an olive branch.
Notable works and accomplishments.
Wallis had exhibitions at the Royal Academy in London during 1897, the Royal Canadian Academy from 1904 to 1937 and the National Gallery of Canada in 1928. Wallis received an honorable mention for her sculpture at the Exposition Universalle. She was not only an exceptional sculptor, but a painter and a poet. Wallis's poems were published as a collection entitled "Chips from the Block". In 1947, the National Gallery of Canada purchased Wallis's most famous sculpture, "La Lutte pour la Vie". Upon her death, she bequeathed her art collection to the City of Peterborough and it is now part of the Peterborough Museum and Archives.

Kamptal

Kamptal is an Austrian wine, tourismus, culture and health region located in Waldviertel, Lower Austria. It is named by the river Kamp.
To the north of Krems lies Langenlois, which is the main vine-town of Kamptal, the valley of the river Kamp. The sandstone slopes are so steep that only a thin layer of soil is retained. Exposure to the sun is high. Riesling thrives on these steep slopes; closer to the Danube the valley broadens and more red grapes are grown.
Another prominent town in the Kamptal is Gars am Kamp.

Kaufingerstraße

The Kaufingerstraße is one of the oldest streets in Munich and, together with the Neuhauser Straße, one of the most important shopping streets in Munich.
Location.
The Kaufingerstraße borders on the west with the Marienplatz and is part of the large west-east axis of the historic old town. It is part of the Salzstraße from Salzburg or Reichenhall via Landsberg to Switzerland. It begins at the Marienplatz and ends at the intersection Färbergraben / Augustinerstraße, which follow approximately the location of the moat of the city's fortifications. Its extension is called Neuhauser Straße.
History.
The Kaufingerstraße is probably named after the patrician Chunradius Choufringer, who is historically mentioned for the first time in a document dated 28 May, 1239. He owned a representative house in Kaufingerstraße. For a while, one assumed the name came from a place called "Kaufing", which, however, could never be confirmed.
Development.
The Kaufingerstraße already had a special position as part of the Salzstraße in the town of Leone. Soon, Munich merchants set up their homes here. The "Obere Tor" (Upper Gate) was considered a particularly representative construction that shaped the building ensembles. The "Obere Tor" was soon named "Chufringer Tor", before it established itself and received the name "Schöner Turm" (pretty tower). Even before the first written mention in 1316, the street was named Chufringerstraße. Therefore, the Kaufingerstraße next to the Rindermarkt is considered the street with the oldest name of Munich.
In the 19th century, the baroque residential buildings of the Munich merchants were replaced by department stores. The largest business building "Zum Schönen Turm" is today the "Hirmer Herrenbekleidungshaus" (Hirmer men’s clothing house).
During the Second World War, the fabric of the Kaufingerstraße was largely destroyed and finally demolished. In the 1990s and the years following, the buildings of the 1950s and 1960s were again replaced by postmodern buildings.
The Kaufingerstraße has always been a very important traffic axis. Since 1972, it has been part of the pedestrian zone in the center of Munich. For this purpose, the Altstadtring was built to direct the traffic around the old town. As a result, the old section of the tram lines from Karlsplatz (Stachus) to Isartor shut down. As an additional traffic axis, the main line of the Munich S-Bahn was opened in the same year under Kaufingerstraße.
With an average of 12,975 passers-by per hour (as of 5 May 2011), Kaufingerstraße is one of the top-selling shopping streets in Germany. The rental and construction site purchase prices are the highest in the Kaufingerstraße than in any other street in Germany. Rental prices are around 300 € and site purchase prices around 50,000 € per square meter (in 2008). In 2008, the street was one of the 10 shopping miles (9th place) with the highest rents in the world. In 2010, it was, with 11.905 passers-by per hour, in third place of the busiest shopping streets in Germany. In 2011, the Kaufingerstraße slipped to number 4 of the most visited shopping streets in Germany behind the Zeil in Frankfurt am Main (13,035 passers-by per hour). Meanwhile, the Neuhauser road placed second in the list. According to a study by Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL), it was the busiest street in Munich with 13,515 passers-by per hour on the deadline. Also in 2013, the Neuhauser Straße placed second with 11,920 passers-by, this time behind the Dortmunder Westenhellweg (12,950 passers-by). Because of this, Munich is the only German city, which has 2 shopping streets in the list of the most visited five. According to an analysis by JLL from the year 2015, Kaufingerstraße is the most expensive shopping street in Germany with a top rent of 360 Euro per square meter.

Fermo chasuble of St. Thomas Becket

The Fermo chasuble of St. Thomas Becket is a garment belonging to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until his murder in 1170.
On display at the Museo Diocesano in Fermo, the chasuble is among the possessions of the treasury of the Fermo Cathedral (Duomo di Fermo). It was donated by Presbitero, bishop of Fermo (1184-1201), who, scholar David Storm Rice suggests, had received it from Thomas Becket himself, when they were both students at the Studium of Bologna. Other sources dispute this claim, and instead suggest that the chasuble was donated by the Cult of Saint Thomas as they passed through Fermo. The textile is one few surviving from the Medieval period, and is believed to one of the oldest examples of Islamic embroidery used for a Christian purpose. This textile also serves as evidence to corroborate a coexistence between the Middle East and Europe during the Medieval period. Most modern knowledge of the chasuble is credited to the efforts of Professor of Islamic Art and Architecture at the University of London, David Storm Rice and textile conservator, Sigrid Müller Christensen, through their collaborative research efforts in the 1950s.
History.
St. Thomas Becket was born in December, 1118 to devout Catholic merchant parents in Cheapside, London. As an adult he began his work as an accountant for three years. He was then introduced to Archbishop Theobald and joined his household. During his time there, he and the Archbishop became close and he was sent to study civil and canon law in Italy and France. In 1154, he was appointed the Archdeacon of Canterbury and, three months later, King Henry II appointed him chancellor. As chancellor he grew very close with the king and was known for living a lavish, expensive lifestyle. However, after being elected Archbishop of Canterbury a year after Theobald’s death in 1161, he became very pious and began disagreeing with the king on many issues. Their relationship became quarrelsome to the point that King Henry II exiled him between November, 1164 and December, 1170. At the end of his exile, four knights, inspired by the words of King Henry, killed him on December 29th, 1170. Three years later, he was canonized by Pope Alexander III.
It is said that after his burial at the Canterbury Cathedral, miracles began taking place at the site. According to John of Salisbury, a friend of St. Thomas and one of his biographers, paralytics, blind, deaf, and mute people, and lepers were cured and the dead were resurrected at St. Thomas’ burial sites. These accounts inspired the Knights of St. Thomas, whose followers would later become the Knights Hospitaller, to found a church and hospital dedicated to Thomas Becket. Large numbers of pilgrims began traveling to Canterbury to pray or be healed.
The chasuble is said to have been a relic as it was the garment Becket was buried in 1170, however other sources dispute if the textile was even fashioned into the Chasuble during Becket's life. Simon-Cahn provides evidence that perhaps the Chasuble was created after Becket’s death to emulate the Chasuble he was buried in, and this garment gained notoriety from the Cult of Saint Thomas Becket, which was increasing in size at that time. The exact provenance of the object is not known, but it appeared in Fermo, Italy as a reliquary under the rebuilding of the cathedral in Fermo under Bishop Presbitero. 
Description.
Originally preserved inside a wooden box decorated in gold with gemstones, the semi-circular chasuble is 1,6 m high and has a circumference of 5,41 m. It is made of light-blue and white silk and decorated in gold and red thread embroidery. The embroidery consists of 34 large roundels interlinked with smaller roundels and eight-pointed stars. The large roundels on the outside of the garment show representations of peacocks, two winged lion griffins, four eagle griffins, frontal eagles with spread wings, confronted birds, confronted winged lions, some rapacious birds atop gazelles, a winged sphinx, and fragments of other animals. There are also representations of elephants with howdahs, one with women inside; four groups of turbaned hunters holding falcons seated on horses with rabbits below, and two enthroned men flanked by musicians and other attendants, all of which portray scenes of the Princely Cycle, a common theme in Islamic art. An oblong panel with a lavish scroll contains this Kufic inscription: "In the name of Allah the Merciful, the Compassionate, the kingdom is Allah's...greatest blessing, perfect health and happiness to its owner...in the year 510 in Mariyya".
The chasuble is constructed from a textile which has been concluded once served a different purpose. Thirty-eight different panels fashion the chasuble, and are arranged in a patchwork manner to construct the bell-shaped garment. The chasuble is made up of different parts sewn together with red silk; some portions were sewn before the embroidery process, others afterwards, making the embroidery itself discontinuous. There is also no clear border to the textile. Potential original uses for the textile have been suggested as a canopy or tent cloth.
Arabic inscriptions.
Due to age, deterioration, and differences of interpretation, the exact translation of the Arabic on this textile is unknown. A majority of the supposed Arabic script on the chasuble is indecipherable, due to the style of calligraphy and the degradation of the silk and embroidery. Historians and translators that have worked on the chasuble do agree on the religious undertones of the written Arabic, specifically the recurrence of the written word الله, Allah. There is also evidence to suggest the presence of pseudo-Arabic script, common at the time in art objects attempting to appear worldly. The Arabic script is written in a floriated Kufic calligraphy style, common to the Fatimid Era. However, historian Isabella Dolezeal accredits the creation of the original textile to a workshop in Islamically ruled Spain, and historian David Jacoby credits at least one panel of the textile to Almeria, Spain specifically. This in part with the animal imagery commonly found during the Fatimid and Norman periods, eastern Mediterranean, and Central Asia, and the object eventual presence in Fermo, supports the evidence of a globally connected middle ages.
Shalem’s book on the chasuble includes a chapter on the Arabic Inscription, with a translation by Mohamed Adb el-Rahim. His version includes the Bismillah prayer from the Quran,  but the remainder of his translation is contested due to anachronistic and a-geographical language factors. Dolezeal also suggests that due to the specific style of the Arabic calligraphy, it is unclear if the writing on the fabric registered to the christians that issued the chasuble as Arabic script.
Studies.
The chasuble is a major example of the process of the Christianisation of an Islamic textile; this  Arabic inscription on the chasuble allows scholars to ascribe the textile to a laboratory working during the Islamic period in Spain. The Christianisation process is proven both by the fact that the textile became a garment used in Christian liturgy and by its association with the worship of Thomas Becket as a saint and martyr, which spread all over Europe during the 13th century.
Early modern research done on the chasuble is somewhat limited, and looks primarily at the garment for its basic elements- cloth, silk, embroidery. Professor David Storm Rice, from University of London, studied the chasuble extensively and was the first to detect and decipher the inscription on the textile. Working together from 1958- 1960 with textile historian Sigrid Müller-Christensen, they compiled what is known today as the Fermo File, which is now stored in the archives of the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum. This report includes physical and historical research on the chasuble. Müller-Christensen was responsible for creating the first modern rendering of the Chasuble in 1973, and her diagrams are still the primary resource when analyzing the chasuble.
Furthermore, due to its importance and exceptional state of preservation, the chasuble has undergone thorough analysis by the art historian Avinoam Shalem with the publication of his book, "The Chasuble of Thomas Becket: A Biography", in 2017, who studied the textile and its history in collaboration with the Bruschettini Foundation, Germano Liberati, Birgitt Borkopp-Restle, Regula Schorta, Miriam Ali-de-Unzaga, Ariane Dor, David Jacoby, Ursula Nilgen, and Marta Jaro.

Critical reception.
Reza Noorani of The Times of India gave the film a rating of 2.5 out of 5 saying that, "While the story is unique and interesting, the execution is flawed, especially when it comes to the horror elements." Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "The spirits of two much-abused genres – horror and comedy – are given an unceremonious burial in Nanu Ki Jaanu, a heavy-handed jumble that is both horrific and funny, neither of which is remotely intentional." Rohit Vats of Hindustan Times gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and said that, "Nanu Ki Jaanu is 132-minute of convoluted chaos. Some talented actors are wasted and some are given a free run to waste their talent." Nandini Ramnath of "Scroll" gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "Faraz Haider’s remake of the Tamil movie ‘Pisaasu’ works very hard to scare viewers away." Anna MM Vetticad of First Post criticized the film saying that, "Abhay Deol is uninspired at best in this loosely handled, low-IQ mess" and gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5.
Bollywood Hungama criticized the film, which is a remake of Tamil film Pisaasu, for being a poor adaptation saying that, "The adaptation by Manu Rishi Chadha is very poor. Manu Rishi Chadha’s screenplay is very weak and only a few moments stand out." The critic concluded the review by saying that, "On the whole, Nanu Ki Jaanu is an extremely poor show." and gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5. Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 saying that, "Nanu Ki Jaanu is so all-out scatter-brained and lame, that we are left wincing rather than laughing." Sameeksha of News18 gave the film a rating of 1.5 out of 5 and concluding her review by saying that, "Overall the film is uneven, half-baked disappointment, which completely wrecks the talent of Abhay, Patralekha and even Chadha. They all deserve better than this." Mayank Shekhar of Mid-Day gave the film a rating of 1 out of 5 and said that, "Suffice it to say, by the end of Nanu Ki Jaanu, pretty much everyone in my theatre (me included) were essentially laughing at the film, rather than with it". Namrata Joshi of The Hindu criticized the film saying that, "Not quite supernatural thriller, Abhay Deol’s latest is plain dull."

Christian Gottlieb Teichelmann

Christian Gottlieb Teichelmann (15 December 1807 – 31 May 1888), also spelt Christian Gottlob Teichelmann, was a Lutheran missionary who worked among Australian Aboriginal people in South Australia. He was a pioneer in describing the Kaurna language, after his work begun at the Piltawodli Native Location in Adelaide, with fellow-missionary Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann.
Life.
Teichelmann came from humble origins. He was born in the Saxon village of Dahme (part of Prussia from 1815), the son of a master clothmaker, and, after an early schooling, was apprenticed as a carpenter's assistant at the age of 14. After several years practising his trade in Saxony and Prussia, he took private lesson to qualify for entry into the Royal Building Trades School in Berlin, where he studied from 1830 to 1831. During this period Teichelmann, after mixing with students who had missionary contacts, enrolled in Jaenicke's Mission school in 1831, where Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann was a fellow-student. There he received a thorough education in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and English, together with theological and historical studies.
Teichelmann and Schürmann then enrolled in the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Society's seminary at Dresden in 1836, obtaining their ordination as Lutheran pastors in early 1838. Later that year they travelled to Australia on the "Pestonjee Bomanjee", arriving in Adelaide on 12 October. One of their fellow passengers happened to be George Gawler who was there to take up his appointment as the new Governor of South Australia.
Missionary and language work.
Notable problems arose when the evangelical Gawler, an evangelical enthusiast himself who had proven supportive of their work, was replaced by George Grey, who insisted rather that Aboriginal people be instructed only in English, preferably in schools run by the state. The German missionaries at the time were the only ones thoroughly at home in native languages and gifted with a practical empathy for the customs and modes of Aboriginal life.
Schürmann and Teichelmann ran a school for Kaurna people at Piltawodli (located in the Adelaide Park Lands), and gained most of their knowledge of the Kaurna language from three respected elders: Mullawirraburka ("King John" / "Onkaparinga Jack"), Kadlitpinna ("Captain Jack") and Ityamaiitpinna ("[King Rodney"). They recorded around about 3000 words, a sketch grammar, hundreds of phrases and sentences along with English translations, traditional songlines, and textual illustrations of differences among dialects. They also created Kaurna translations of six German hymns as well as the Ten Commandments. The records compiled by them have proven highly valuable in projects to reconstruct the language.
Family.
Teichelmann married Margaret Nicholson on 25 December 1843, and they had fifteen children together. One son, Ebenezer Teichelmann, became a surgeon, mountaineer and conservationist in New Zealand.

Malaya Akulukjuk

Malaya Akulukjuk was an Inuit artist who drew works inspired by her life as a shaman and Inuit spirituality through depictions of human-animal transformations. Akulukjuk was born in 1915 (though some sources state 1912 and 1921), and lived a traditional Inuit life in the Qikiqtat Camp of Nunavut before moving to Pangnirtung on Baffin Island in 1962. Her career as an artist started later than most, at the age of 51. 
In 1969, the Canadian Federal Department of Indian and Northern Affairs opened the Pangnirtung Weave Shop with the aim of creating a craft industry in the community. With Akulukjuk's guidance her drawings were translated onto the woven tapestries by fellow members of the Pangnirtung Weave Shop. Many of Akulukjuk's works were inspired by her memories of traditional life which revolve around camping and family gatherings, and the others were rooted from her imagination of mystical creatures.
A large collection of Akulukjuk's drawings went on exhibitions across Canada. Some of Akulukjuk's pieces such as Inuit Ways (1979) and Hunting Polar Bears with Harpoon (1982) are displayed in the National Gallery of Canada and various museums across the country. The Heffel Gallery, one of Canada's fine art auction houses, sells Akulukjuk's works as well as the tapestries of weaver Agah Etooangat based on Akulukjuk's drawings. Akulukjuk's art is crucial to the development of Inuit weaving tapestry by visualizing the old Inuit life and shamanism. 
Early life.
Malaya Akulukjuk was born in Quikitat Camp (a former Whaling station) in 1915 (though some sources state 1912 and 1921). She married at the age of twenty. In the Inuit society, arranged marriages were a tradition to ensure all marriageable adults could have partners during their childbearing years. Akukuljuk became a mother to thirteen children. While pregnant, she continued hunting and participating in land. She moved later to the settlement in Pangnirtung on Baffind Island with her husband and children in 1960.
Personal Life and Family.
Akulukjuk got married at the early age of twenty, which was much against her will. In the Inuit society, arranged marriages was a tradition to ensure that all marriageable adults could have partners during their childbearing years. Akulukjuk became a mother of thirteen children, but she did not give up hunting in her pregnancy, and sometimes she went hunting by carrying a baby in her hood. Akulukjuk's late husband, Nutaralaq Akulukjuk, was a sculpture artist. Several of his works had been sold at auctions, including "Man Drinking" sold at Waddington's Inuit Art Online Auction in 2017. Many of Akulukjuk's children became future artists in Pangnirtung, including five of her sons, Jeetaloo, Geeshee, Juelee, Enukee and Moar. Her daughter, May Lonsdale, developed into a graphic artist. In Akulukjuk's adult life, she suffered from poor eyesight, and sometimes she had to use magnifying glasses to create paintings.
Pioneer Artist at the Pangnirtung Tapestry Studio.
The Aboriginal people of the Canadian Arctic have led a semi-nomadic lifestyle for centuries by living off the land. This nomadic lifestyle meant there was no continuous center for economic and community life. During the Resettlement Period in the 1960s, Canada's Inuit were relocated changing their lifestyle significantly. To aid in this process the Canadian government funded art and crafts initiatives across the Arctic region and contracted companies to administer and run these programs. Karen Bulow LTD, a weaving company from Montreal, created the Pilot Weaving Program for the Pangnirtung community. In 1970 the project manager Donald Stuart and three woman employees arrived to train and begin the program.
The women quickly learned the hand-weaving techniques and moved onto the loom weaving creating linear patterns and items like sashes, hats and blankets. Many of the woman being leaders in the community easily understood weaving partly because of the finger weaving introduced by missionaries in the 1930-40s and the traditional Inuit culture of creating clothing and everyday items out of items from the land. In celebration of the centennial year of the Northwest Territories, Queen Elizabeth II visited Iqualuit and was given a Pangnirtung Weave Shop blanket. Stuart recalls the Queen remarking how cold it was and "that when the blanked was presented she put it on and wrapped it around her knees right away…" Prince Philip reached over to touch and she said "No, it’s mine!"
The pilot weaving program was proving to be successful and positively impacting the surrounding community but the cost of running it the program too high for the small items being sold. The goods produced in the Pangnirtung Weave Shop did not have the ‘Inuit look’ which is what customers wanted from Northern goods. The program directors looked to government initiatives and the markets for such goods and decided woven wall hangings or tapestries would be the best for economic profit of the program. To make the tapestries they needed original Inuit drawings to translate into the woven textiles. Stuart took paper and pens throughout the community asking elders if they wanted to draw. Malaya Akulukjuk was one of the first artists discovered, she was 51. Her drawings set the precedent of what types and style of art was to be showcased on the tapestries. Other artists included Annie Pitsiuluk, Annie Kilabuk and Elisapee Ishulutak. The first exhibition of the Pangnirtung tapestries was on March 28, 1971 in Montreal. All 23 tapestries sold to private collectors and museums.
The Pangnirtung Weave Shop was moved into the Uqqurmiut Inuit Artists Association Centre which created a central management of all arts and crafts. The centre merges the Print Shop, Tapestry Studio, Retail Craft Gallery and an office for administration under one roof. The creation of the Pangnirtung Weave Shop has been a successful and helpful tool bridging the gap between the Inuit living off the land and living in settlements. The art was a source of cultural identity and pride but also an economic source for the region.
The Federal Development of Indian and Northern Affairs Canada in 2001 estimates that 20% of the Inuit derive part of their income from the arts and crafts programs. Without the work at the Weave Shop or other arts and crafts programs many would be solely reliant on social assistance money.
Works and Shamanism.
Unlike many other traditional cultures, women were significantly powerful in the Inuit religion because they took leading roles in spiritual matters. Although Malaya Akulukjuk did not openly acknowledge her identity, she was reputed as a shaman in the Pangnirtung community. Shamans are people with special powers that enable them to act as a mediator between the spiritual world and the temporal world, and they have helping spirits to assist them with supernatural tasks. In Inuit communities, people believe that a shaman is able to maintain the spirit's favour by appropriately practicing her unique abilities, including her power of second sight, her "X-ray" vision, and her control of animal spirits. Shamanism is based on the animistic belief that a helping spirit could exist in every being and take different forms, which are commonly seen in birds and polar bears. In Akulukjuk's drawings, she adopts the role of "artist as shaman" by vividly portraying her access to the spiritual world which is filled with transformative animals and supernatural beings. Her spirit figures are rooted from her imagination and the stories she had heard in childhood.
In 1972, Akulukjuk's drawing "Oalopalik" depicts a helping spirit, which could possibly be her own. During an interview with Asia Papatsie, the Inuit elder confirmed that this helping spirit was a bird that acted as the shaman's eyes. In Inuit beliefs, such a spirit could fly over long distance and report to the shaman what it had seen. In Akulukjuk's later artistic career, she started to depict complex themes with multiple characters, and those works continued to communicate her shamanistic beliefs. For instance, her drawing of "Two Bears with Skin Frame" in 1977 displays two polar bear spirits that live in a different dimension. These spirits are viewed as bear people, who hunt like the Inuit but usually live inside a paddle or a rock. In this drawing, the bear people are stretching an animal skin that may have been later used to sew skin clothes.
Akulukjuk's other drawings involve human interactions with birds, and animal spirits that co-exist with humans on the Inuit landscapes. In her drawing "Lady with Birds" (1977), Akulukjuk depicts a girl who plays with her bird that she may has been tamed from a young age. The girl's hairstyle reveals that she is not married yet. Here, Akulukjuk emphasizes the intimacy between human and animal spirits, which reflects her shamanistic practices because she has personal interactions with those spirits. In Akulukjuk's another drawing, "Malaya’s Story" (1981), Inuit people and animal spirits are depicted in the same space. While community members are preparing for hunting and food storage, the goose spirit is moving in his own directions. Akulukjuk presents her perspective as a shaman by visualizing the co-existence of everyday community life and the spiritual realm.
Community life.
In the Pangnirtung Tapestry Studio, the first generation of artists like Malaya Akulukjuk were mostly elders that had previously lived a traditional Inuit life. Akulukjuk was growing up in a whaling station, and lived as a nomadic hunter during her early years. When she adopted her artistic career, she viewed drawing as a way to pass on her rich knowledge of the "true Inuit life" to the younger generation. After the resettlement, drawing was a coping strategy for Akulukjuk to fulfil her responsibility as an elder. In the Tapestry Studio, the weavers are usually young girls in their early twenties and they learned the Inuit past from the elders by transforming their drawings into tapestries.
In the "Inuit Quarterly", the writer states that Inuit elders produce "memory art" instead of commercial art. The elders were eager to tell stories of the past and traditional lifestyles because they were afraid of losing their own identity to the western cultural invasions. Akulukjuk enjoyed using her imagination and memories to present Inuit life of her youth, as well as natural landscapes with tiny human or animal figures. Many of her drawings reconstruct traditional Inuit community life. In 1981, the tapestry of "Malaya’s Story" demonstrated that the Inuit people used the whale's body to store food and make tools. They also used sled dogs for transportation, and carried some weapons in their hands when they went out hunting. The other painting, "Children at Summer Camp" (1980) revealed that Inuit people lived in sealskin tents during the summer. The young couple lives in a smaller tent that has seal skin boots drying on the poles, while the older couple lives in a bigger tent with a wooden door. The door indicates that the old couple has high status in their community (they are suggested to be prominent hunters) because wood is a very precious resource in the Inuit society.
Akulukjuk's drawings also present her knowledge of land and wildlife in a practical sense. Some of her drawings are purely landscapes scenes of the old Inuit territories, including "Spring Breakup" (1995), "Camp Site" (1995) and "Inukshuk Trail" (1995). These landscape drawings were created at the end of Akulukjuk's life. The artist was eager to go back to these campsites, but she could no longer go out on the land. They revealed Akulukjuk's strong emotional connections and her long-lasting memories of the old Inuit lands. On the other hand, there are pure animal depictions such as "Galloping Caribou" (1994) and "Playful Narwhales" (1980) in Akulukjuk's drawings. These animals were commonly seen on the Inuit land, and they used to be the primary food resources for the survival of the community.
Cooperation Between Artists and Weavers.
Tapestry weaving in Pangnirtung has always been a cooperative production that combined the skills of two parties, the drawing artists and the weavers. The submission of the drawing is done by one artist, while the interpretation of the drawing into the medium of tapestry is produced by another artist of the weaving shop. The tapestry artist would choose the colours of the final production, which is rarely discussed with the drawing artist since weavers are believed to have more knowledge about the effective use of colours. Many of Akulukjuk's drawings were made into tapestries by different weavers, and the final productions changed the colours, sizes, and proportions of her original drawings.
For instance, her drawing "Children at Summer Camp" (1980) was originally created with black and brown pen; while its rich and saturated colours were added by the tapestry artist, Kawtysee Kakee. Moreover, the original drawing has more defined lines, which clearly demonstrate how children engage in everyday activities such as brewing tea and cooking meat. However, in the tapestry production, the surface becomes rough, and the depictions of food are less detailed. The tapestry artist focuses on mixing the soft colours of the wool with a lighter thread, which creates the glow of warm evening light. By creating this natural light, the image is given a sense of time as well as a nostalgic feeling of beauty.
Akulukjuk's drawing, Spring Break (1995) is painted by coloured pencils, which depicts the scene of mountains, valleys and ice fields being lightened by the rising sun. Akulukjuk uses soft colours to portray this scene, including light yellow, blue and white. They create a dreamy atmosphere, and evokes the impression of a paradise rooted from the artist's memory. Compared to the original drawing, the tapestry production adds more layers of perspective to the flat surface by incorporating vivid colours as well as making the mountains look sharp and outstanding.
National and International Exhibitions.
Akulukjuk's works have been exhibited in galleries across Canada, including the National Gallery, the Inuit Gallery of Vancouver, the Arts and Crafts Guild of Quebec, the University of Alberta. They even went overseas, and reached as far as the Jerusalem Artists House Museum. Two of Akulukjuk's works, "Inuit Ways" (1979) and "Hunting Polar Bears with Harpoon" (1982) are displayed in the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa. The Heffel Gallery, one of Canada's fine art auction houses, sells Akulukjuk's works as well as the tapestries of weaver Agah Etooangat based on Akulukjuk's drawings.

Grace Wilson Melvin

Grace Wilson Melvin (1892/1896 - 1977) was a Scottish artist, teacher, and academic professional who was born in Glasgow. According to most sources, Melvin's date of birth was May 28, 1892; however, some sources state the year as 1896. Melvin has been noted as one of two women who were responsible for bringing modern calligraphy designs to Canada (the other being Esme Davis).
Education.
Melvin began studying art at the Glasgow School of Art in 1907. She took classes in drawing, painting, and design, while also attending life classes. Her work was influenced by the Art Nouveau period in which she was creating, which had Pre-Raphaelite influences. Melvin studied under the guidance of Robert Anning Bell, Maurice Grieffenhager, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Caley Robinson, and Ann MacBeth. She graduated with honours in 1916 and received a post-graduate diploma with honours in 1918. Melvin discovered her passion for illumination whilst studying on scholarship to London's British Museum, and was given special permission to recreate some of the works.
Career.
Melvin ended her studies at the Glasgow School of Art in 1918 and became a faculty member in 1920. Courses that she taught, between 1920 and 1927, included:
Melvin also worked as a scribe for the Corporation of Glasgow, making illuminated addresses for significant people. She traveled to Vancouver, B.C., in 1927 for a two-year leave of absence from the Glasgow School of Art to help organize the Design Department at the Vancouver Art School. According to the Canadian Women Artists History Initiative, Melvin came to Canada at the request of her brother-in-law Charles H. Scott. However, there is seemingly no further mention of him in her life nor of any involvement in the Vancouver Art School. There, Melvin accepted a full-time position as the Head of the Design Department in 1929. She was interested in First Nations art and encouraged her students to use such art for inspiration in their own work. She retired from the Vancouver Art School in 1952 and became a full-time painter, while also publishing and illustrating numerous books. Her main passion was lettering and illumination, but she also created many landscape, garden and urban coastal scenes. The mediums that Melvin worked in included watercolor, oil, and ink.
Publications and art work.
One of Melvin's most notable works is "The Books of Remembrance" for the Canadian Engineers of World War I that she created, which is on display in St Paul's Cathedral in London, England. She completed illustrations for many books by Marius Barbeau, including "The Indian Speaks" from 1943, and "Le Rêve de Kamalmouk" from 1948. Her book titled "Basic Lettering for Art Students" from 1930 is reportedly still used in instruction today. She had many books commissioned for the Department of Education of British Columbia, including the "Student Manual and Workbook" from 1949 and the "Teacher's Manual: Containing in Full 'the Student Manual and Workbook' with a Suggested Approach".
Final years.
Grace Wilson Melvin died in Vancouver, B.C., on March 8, 1977.

Egevadluq Ragee

Egevadluq Ragee (Eegivudluk, Eegyvudtuk, Egyvudlo, Eegeevadluk, Eegyvudluk, Eevudlook, Eegyvadluk) was a Canadian artist, known primarily for her hand drawn prints and acrylics.
Career.
Egevadluq Ragee’s interest in art began in 1959 while living in Tikerak when two other artists, Sheowak and Napatchie Pootoogook encouraged her to start drawing. From there Ragee began creating her early works, which were often drawn with graphite pencil on paper. Her drawings primarily feature mythical creatures, bird-animal-human transformations and scenes of traditional life in the Inuit. As her art developed, Ragee began experimenting with new mediums including acrylics, pen and ink, printmaking and wax crayon.
Ragee’s drawing style has been recognized for its use of small, short strokes used to shade large spaces, which was uncommon for artists of this period. With this technique, Ragee could incorporate new textures into her artworks. In addition to her drawings, by 1970 Ragee began painting with acrylics, making her one of the first Inuit in Cape Dorset to work with that medium.

Egevadluq Ragee was born on October 30, 1920 near Cape Dorset, in the small camp of Ikirasak in Nunavut. Ragee lived with her parents, Pamiaktok and Sorisolutu until the birth of her sister when she began living with her grandparents in a nearby camp.
Ragee’s first marriage was to Kootoo with whom she had a son and daughter, the latter dying early in infancy. Soon after their son’s death, Kootoo himself died from an undisclosed illness.
When Ragee’s daughter reached four years of age, she remarried to Sakkiassie and they adopted four children together. Originally living in Nuvudjuak, the couple eventually moved their family to Tikerak, a camp eight miles from Cape Dorset. In 1967, Ragee and her family moved again to Cape Dorset in response to the improved housing conditions. Ragee continued to live and work there until her death on June 26, 1983.

Angelique Merasty

Angelique Merasty (1924–17 January 1996) was a Canadian First Nations birchbark biting artist of the Woodland Cree First Nation.
Background.
Merasty was born in Beaver Lake, Saskatchewan, where she spent most of her life practicing and selling her artwork.
Merasty was best known for her birchbark bitings, the Indigenous art practice of dentally perforating designs into folded sheets of thin bark. Birchbark biting is one of the oldest Indigenous art forms, historically practiced by women of the Subarctic and Northeastern Woodlands of Canada and the United States. While most birchbark biters created designs with lines, Merasty used a pointillist approach and created complex symmetrical images of flowers, insects, animals, and landscape sceneries. She died at the age of 66, and was one of the last recorded artists to maintain the Indigenous, traditional art of birchbark biting. Merasty's work was showcased in several Canadian museums including the Museum of Man and Nature and the Thunder Bay Art Gallery.
Personal life.
Merasty grew up on an island in Beaver Lake in northern Saskatchewan, where she lived with her mother, Susan Ballantyne. She married Bill Merasty in 1947, who also assisted Angelique Merasty with her artistic practices. Together, they had one son named Joseph Merasty, who died 6 months after his birth due to an illness. By the time Angelique turned 50, her birchbark biting practice caused many of her teeth to fall out. She was however, able to get false teeth funded by the government, including 2 sharpened upper canines that were specifically designed to help Merasty continue her art. On 7 January 1996, Merasty died of a heart attack in Saskatoon.
Artistic career.
Methods and style.
Merasty is best known for her birchbark bitings. Birchbark biting was historically a social past time, but in the 1950s, Merasty and her mother, Susan Ballantyne, began to sell their work at a summer resort near their home for 10 or 15 cents each. Merasty collected bark with the assistance of her husband, Bill Merasty. Together, they would travel by boat up to 15 miles away to find the best trees, which were white, smooth, clean, and at least 10 layers thick. The best season for harvesting bark was during the Spring time, when trees were thawing. Immediately after a harvest, was the ideal time to birchbark bite.
Merasty’s process for creating each biting remained consistent. For each work, she folded a fresh layer of birch bark, two or more times, depending on the size and complexity of the work. Merasty would then rotate the folded shape by using her hands and tongue, while biting marks along its folds. Her designs usually began at the centre fold, and moved towards the outer edges. The pressure of her bites varied, resulting in a range of shades and surface textures. Her method of creating, produced intricate and symmetrical compositions. The sizes of her works were anywhere between seven-and-a-half centimetres, to around twenty-five centimetres.
In Merasty’s early artistic practices, her designs were mostly geometric, but she later emerged with a unique style. She departed from established practices, by utilizing a pointillist approach for her bitings, rather than linear incisions. Merasty achieved complex, curvilinear designs, with a preference for flower and animal imagery. Later in her career, she was able to complete works from beginning to end without looking at her progress.
Exhibitions.
Merasty’s art was showcased in many Canadian museums, including the Museum of Man and nature (1980) and the Thunder Bay Art Gallery (1983). Her work was also selected to be offered as a first prize for notable local and provincial cross country skiing competitions. Permanent displays of her work are on show at the Flin Flon Library as well as the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Today, collectors pay thousands of dollars for her work.
Legacy.
Angelique Merasty was one of the last practicing birch-biters recorded in North America during her time. She passed her teachings on to a woman named Angelique Merasty Levac, who lives in Manitoba. She is known for reviving the art or birch-bark biting, and there is now an estimate of 12 known people who continue this tradition in North America.

Mattie Gunterman

Mattie Gunterman, born Ida Madeline Warner (Spring 1872 – 1945), was a Canadian photographer and mining camp cook in British Columbia. Gunterman started taking photos in the spring of 1897, mainly documenting her family and from that point forward her interest and skill in photography continued to grow. From the years 1899 to 1911, she served as a cook at a mining camp while also creating autobiographical photographs. She received some formal training about the basics of photography while growing up in La Crosse from her photographer uncle. Gunterman often included herself in her photographs creating a personal narrative of pioneer life in Canada and representing herself as a self-sufficient and confident leader. She contributed a notable historical record of the early 1900s mining boom in Lardeau, a former mining region located in the Kootenays region of British Columbia. In 1927, the Gunterman's home in Beaton was destroyed by a fire therefore much of her work was lost. The only existing work of Gunterman's are three photograph albums that currently belong to her grandson, Avery Gunterman and three hundred glass plate negatives that are part of the Vancouver Public Library collection. An exhibition of her work alongside Emily Carr’s was on display at the Vancouver Art Gallery from May 5 to September 3, 2018.
Personal life.
1887 to 1889.
Mattie Gunterman was born in La Crosse, Wisconsin and not much is known about her family or childhood. An 1880 United States census provides confirmation that she lived with her grandmother and that her mother was born in Pennsylvania and her father was born in Michigan. She continuously battled health problems throughout her life. She learned photography from an uncle who had a studio in La Crosse. In 1889 she left La Crosse and moved west to Seattle, Washington.
1889 to 1898.
She married William Gunterman, a candy maker in 1891 and the two had one son together, Henry, in 1892. She had consistent problems with her lungs and her health significantly weakened in 1896. In 1897 the Guntermans trekked to British Columbia to see about moving there permanently and along this trip she took some of her earliest photographs. Her health was a major factor that influenced her life and she was advised by her doctor to move to a drier climate. Thus her and her husband decided to permanently move from Seattle to Beaton, British Columbia, formerly known as Thomson's Landing in 1898. Although Gunterman continuously struggled with her health, she had a survivalist attitude and persevered through twelve-hour shifts at the mining cookhouses.
Career.
Gunterman mainly took photographs from 1897 to 1911. Her photographs were mainly taken in areas surrounding Beaton and the Arrow Lakes District of British Columbia as well as in the Pacific Northwest and California during her travels there in 1905. Typically during the winter months Gunterman would develop her glass plate negatives and turn them into prints. Initially, her primary purpose for taking photographs was to record her life, family and surroundings for her son Henry. She created her own autobiographical narrative through her photographs. In order to create self-portraits and to include herself in group photos, Gunterman would use a piece of rubber tubing attached to the camera's inflatable shutter at one end and a rubber bulb at the other to take the picture. The first camera that she used was a Bull's Eye snapshot camera. Her works at the start mainly consisted of posed group photos. She then purchased a No.5 Cartridge Kodak 4 x 5 plate camera in 1898 as it allowed for more versatility when playing with exposure, focusing and shutter speed. In 1902 Gunterman became the chef at the Nettie-L mine in the Lardeau region and at each long work shift she brought along her camera. She captured everyday life at the mine such as scenic views of the Lardeau region, men working hard in the mine and her fellow kitchen co-workers. Her photographs expose the gruelling work at the mine but also focus on more lighthearted aspects such as games they would play. Mining operations such as the Nettie-L and other surrounding mines totally ceased by 1905. However within the Kootenays logging activity increased and became another subject for Gunterman to photograph. Her work is essential for understanding life during the mining boom in the early 1900s. Furthermore, her photographs of both mining and logging activity are fundamental for understanding the jobs that drove the Canadian economy during the turn of the century. Gunterman's work is also some of the only photographic evidence of these mining towns when they were flourishing. In present-day these towns do not exist therefore her photographs serve to remember this region when it was prosperous and thriving.
Later years and legacy.
During the late 1910s and into the 1920s when Beaton had become a quieter area, Gunterman, along with her husband Will worked as travelling cooks in nearby areas. In 1927, the Guntermans home burned down therefore many of her photographs were destroyed. However, a number of glass plate negatives and a few albums were stored elsewhere so they survived. Gunterman died in 1945 and three of her photograph albums are currently in the possession of her grandson, Avery Gunterman. Ron D’Altroy of the Vancouver Public Library became interested in Gunterman's work in 1961 and rediscovered three hundred of her glass plate negatives in Henry Gunterman's attic. After collecting these photographs and gaining permission to keep them, the Vancouver Public Library Board digitized her photographs. Her photographs help to reveal life in the Kootenay region of British Columbia. Gunterman's work continues to gain more attention as it has become more accessible to the public through its digitization. From April 28 to September 3, 2018 her work was displayed alongside Emily Carr's at the Vancouver Art Gallery in an exhibition entitled "Emily Carr in Dialogue with Mattie Gunterman."

Mathilde Flögl

Mathilde Flögl (9 September 1893 - 1958) was an Austrian artist and designer. She worked in several different mediums including textiles, glass, and paint. Flögl was also a member of the Wiener Werkstätte, literally translated to the Vienna Workshops. This group was part of the Arts and Crafts movement dedicated to elegance, utility, and appropriateness. They aimed to refine art and expand it to all fields of life. Flögl was very active in this group, she participated in most of the major Wiener Werkstätte exhibitions. Currently, the Viennese Museum of Applied Arts houses over 1,600 of Flögl's works from when she was involved with the Wiener Werkstätte. Among these are many independent works and collaborations with other individuals in the group. Notable members of the Wiener Werkstätte include two of its founders Josef Hoffman and Koloman Moser as well as Gustav Klimt, among others. For the group's 25th anniversary, Flögl amassed, arranged, wrote, and published, "The Wiener Werkstatte, 1903-1928: The Evolution of the Modern Applied Arts". The book itself was a work of art using elaborate materials and decoration in its pages.
The group's finances were always precarious because of their use of these costly materials but in 1929 the Wiener Werkstätte disbanded due to bankruptcy with the stock market crash that same year. In 1931, Flögl began a studio of her own which she operated for four years. Flögl was also a member of the Wiener Frauenkunst (Viennese Women's Art), a group of female artists working in Vienna.
Flögl's work is currently in museums around the world including the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, The Kyoto Costume Institute in Kyoto, and the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna, among others.
Life and schooling.
Mathilde Flögl was born on 9 September 1893 in Brno, Czech Republic. Between 1909–16, she studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (School of the Applied Arts) in Vienna. During her education, Flögl focused on applied graphics and enamelling taught by Josef Hoffman and Oskar Strnad among others. Flögl died in 1958 in Salzburg, Austria.
Flögl and the Wiener Werkstätte.
Flögl joined the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshop) in 1916, an artist collective focusing on refinement of material and integrating art into all aspects of life. Their pieces were made both independently and on commission. The collective was formally registered as “Wiener Werkstätte, Productivgenossenschaft von Kunsthandwerkern in Wien, Genossenschaft mit unbeschränkter Haftung” (Vienna Workshops manufacturing co-operative of artist craftsmen in Vienna, co-operative with unlimited liability) in 1903 by Josef Hoffman, Koloman Moser, and .
The workshop had conflicting views on its integration of women artists. It was known to many as a space for women to produce art without the burden of the male gaze. The majority of women in the collective were paid as much as their male counterparts. Yet, a critic describes the Wiener Werkstaette workshop in Döblergasse:
Flögl joined the workshop in its second iteration when the original Wiener Werkstäette liquidated in 1914 due to difficulty in selling their work and thus a lack of funding. The renewed Wiener Werkstaette, now called “Betriebsgesellschaft m.b.H. der Wiener Werksatte Productivegenossenschaft für Gegenstände des Kunstgewerbes” (Vienna workshops manufacturing cooperative for handicraft objects Ltd.) was under the direction of Philipp Hauser, Hoffman's colleague, and supported by the Primavesi family who owned 33% of the company's shares. The collective worked in furniture, glass, ceramics, silver and metalwork, jewellery, fashion, graphic design, among other mediums. They opened shops in Switzerland and the USA.
Flögl designed and produced works of art in many different mediums, some in collaboration with other members of the Wiener Werkstaette like Hoffman. For example, on a glass, Flögl painted the designs on the sides of a cup Hoffman constructed. Similarly, with a glass box, Flögl added the floral designs while Hoffman manufactured the box. Flögl also painted murals for residences and establishments in Vienna including the Graben-Café. She worked in fashion, notably designing the fabric for a gown at the held at the Kyoto Costume Institute, in addition to accessories such as beaded necklaces. She also did many ceramic pieces including a ceramic candelabra (c. 1925) and a ceramic hunting scene featuring dogs attacking a deer (1917). Designs for textiles, glassware, and metalwork seems to be where most of her work lies.
Flögl used floral designs in her work in addition to more geometric patterns making pieces that were both abstract and linear. An example of this style is seen in a swatch called Fälter (butterfly), designed for the bedspread of Karl Duldig and Slawa Horowitz-Duldig in 1924. It was block printed onto silk. This use of an artist's work as a bedspread also exemplified the Wiener Werkstätte's belief in art being incorporated into all areas of life. Flögl used abstract shapes and geometric lines, as was characteristic of her work, to produce columns of bright butterflies separated by colourful vertical lines. Flögl was partial to butterflies. In 1929, Swiss-German company, Salubra manufactured a wallpaper collection designed by Flögl. Copper Hewitt has an online collection featuring 59 pieces of her painted design work, most painted in gouache.
For the group's 25th anniversary, Flögl edited, arranged, wrote, and published, "The Wiener Werkstätte, 1903-1928: The Evolution of the Modern Applied Arts Exhibitions". It was published in English, French, and German. The book includes essays on the group's notable figures, members’ monograms, and illustrations of the members’ work over the 25-year period. The text was received with mixed reviews; Some criticised the text's lack of typographical process and Max Ermers, associated with Adolf Loos (a notable architect of the time), asserted that the text showed the “spirit of the very spirit of the WW, culture of the terminal culture proper to the Decline of the West.”
Exhibitions.
While Flögl was a part of the collective, the Wiener Werkstätte was involved with many exhibitions. One of the earlier exhibitions featuring Flögl included the 1917 “Stockholm Austrian Art Exhibition,” where 240 pieces were contributed by the Wiener Werkstätte. The exhibition was designed to display's Austria's creativity during WWI, a creativity that would continue into times of peace too. In 1925, the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et industriels Modernes was held In Paris. This exhibition was designed to display modern forms of aesthetics, anything that reproduced previous styles was rejected from the exhibition. 1930 was the year of the Werkbund exhibition in Paris. The exhibition featured the French decorative style and the more standardized German style.
A Workshop of Her Own.
Between 1931-1935 Flögl operated her own workshop, centred around fashion and interior design
The Wiener Frauenkunst.
Flögl was reported to have been a part of the Wiener Frauenkunst (literally translated to Viennese Women's Art) which emerged from the “Vereinigung bildender Künstlerinnen Österreichs” (Association of Fine Artists of Austria) (VBKÖ) in 1926. The group proved to be much more radical than the VBKÖ. It aimed to encourage women's artwork, taking attention away from and destabilizing male art organizations, announcing liberation from the patriarchal art world. They investigated gender through a feminist lens. The Wiener Frauenkunst held many exhibitions in Vienna. The group closed in 1956 shortly after the founder, Fanny Harlfinger, died as no new members joined and the old ones seemed inactive.

Education.
Betty Ayako Mochizuki studied at the Ontario College of Art and Design in Toronto. Mochizuki graduated in 1954, specializing in landscapes and still-life paintings. Throughout her life, she studied under Canadian Artists Jock Macdonald and Jack Nichols.
Artwork and mentions.
Betty Mochizuki is noted for her lively and impressionistic landscape designs, as well as her paintings of flowers and graphic-styled still life works. Mochizuki's work touches on her family's Japanese heritage, and the integration of multiple cultural backgrounds into one's own identity When questioned about her works' stylistically eastern influences, she replied that "it just comes out that way." Mochizuki's unnamed pen and ink drawing, which depicts several whales playing within an amulet, is featured in the poetry anthology book "Whale Sound". The work reflects Mochizuki's printmaking skill, illustrating her understanding of defined and steady line-work. Mochizuki's oil painting "Scented Memory" is currently displayed in the Art Gallery of Ontario, which was donated as a gift from Douglas M. Duncan's personal collection after his passing. In the book by Joan Murray, "Confessions of a Curator", a painting by Mochizuki is mentioned, though the title is not stated. The work is recalled as a favourite of the MP's receptionist, who refused to let it be taken back after the Art Gallery of Ontario had lent it. A short biography on Mochizuki is published in the fourth volume of "A Dictionary of Canadian Artists".
Exhibitions and reception.
Mochizuki held several solo exhibitions with the Picture Loan Society in 1955, 1958, 1960, and 1976. Mochizuki featured her Oil Painting Cycle in the Canadian Group of Painters Exhibition in 1962 and 1963, which showcased her ability to depict abstract content among her collection of landscapes, and indicates a great range of versatility. Mochizuki's work was frequently featured in exhibitions held by the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour. Mochizuki held several solo shows, one of which was composed solely of her oil paintings, and another that showcased her works in watercolour. In 1976, Mochizuki held another solo show of her paintings and drawings at the Sisler Gallery in Toronto.
Mochizuki's watercolours displayed at her solo "Watercolour Exhibition" in 1960 were noted for their technical excellence, though she was criticized for deriving much inspiration from the works of others. Despite criticism, she was considered an artist to watch, and Colin Sabiston stated that he believed she would rank well in later years. Another critic noted Mochizuki's work as being graceful, yet vivacious, with her landscape and flower paintings being stated as having charm and delicacy. Two of Mochizuki's landscape paintings featured in the "Jack Sullivan Sculpture Exhibit" in 1965 were "especially worth mentioning" and were considered a notable attraction amongst the other works. In 1962, Mochizuki was awarded the C.W. Jeffery's Award for Outstanding Graphic Art for her work
Most of Mochizuki's work is kept in private collections, however several of her pieces are currently displayed at University of Toronto, Judith &amp; Norman Alix Art Gallery, Sarnia, Museum London, and the Art Gallery of Ontario.

Daphne Glenne

Daphne Glenne (1886–1972), born Dorothy Cornelius, was an English leading actress in musical theatre and silent film in the period around 1910–1920.
Biography.
She was born and grew up in Blackheath in south-east London. She adopted the stage name Daphne Glenne in response to her father's disapproval of her seeking a career on the stage, and she continued to use this as her name throughout her life.
She began her theatrical career as a chorister with the D’Oyly Carte Company at the Savoy Theatre in 1906–1907, at one point taking a minor role in the Gilbert and Sullivan opera Iolanthe.
Subsequently, she was engaged by George Edwardes to play in his touring production of Franz Lehár’s "The Merry Widow". Initially she played Olga, but quickly took over the title role of Sonia, which she performed around Britain from 1908-1910. 
Returning to London, she took over the role of Lady Augusta in the musical play "The Dollar Princess" at Daly's Theatre. However, she was soon engaged by the American producer Charles Frohman to play the title role in his touring production of "The Dollar Princess" which travelled around the US in 1910-1911, starting in San Francisco.
Later in 1911, she returned to the United States in the role of Princess Mathilde in Lionel Monckton’s "The Quaker Girl", which ran from 1911-1912 in New York at the Park Theatre on Broadway. She continued to play this role in George Edwardes’ touring production in Britain after her return later in 1912.
From 1913 onwards, she played leading roles in a series of successful musical comedies and revues, both in London and on tour, including "Bric-a-Brac", "Tonight's the Night", and "The Dancing Mistress".
In 1917 she was persuaded by the prominent film producer Will Barker to move into silent films. After the success of her first film "On Leave", Barker engaged her for another three years to make further films, billing her as “England’s Own Picture Girl”. Between 1918 and 1920 she made five more films (4 of them for Barker) in which she played lead roles, with directors including Alexander Butler and Bert Haldane. No copies of these films appear to have survived.
After 1920 she made no further films, and her career on the stage and in film basically ended. By then Barker had retired and sold his production facilities at Ealing Studios, while her two patrons in musical comedy, George Edwardes and Charles Frohman, had both died in 1915 (Frohman in the sinking of the RMS Lusitania).
In 1928 she re-appeared briefly in the musical play "Topsy and Eva" in Glasgow with The Duncan Sisters, under the direction of Jack Buchanan, but she is not listed in the opening cast for the London staging that followed.
From the 1930s until the early 1950s she ran a dancing school in Birmingham, putting on revues and pantomimes for charity, especially during the wartime period.
After retiring she lived in South London and died in 1972 at a nursing home in Bexhill.

Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann

Clamor Wilhelm Schürmann (7 June 1815 – 3 March 1893) was a Lutheran missionary who emigrated to Australia and did fundamental pioneering work, together with his colleague Christian Gottlieb Teichelmann, on recording some Australian languages in South Australia.
Life.
Schürmann was born in the village of Schledehausen, near Osnabrück, Germany, and was soon bereaved of his parents, his father dying a year after his birth, and his mother when he was eleven. His elder brother had enrolled in 's or Mission school in Berlin, and Schürmann followed in his footsteps after completing his elementary education, enrolling there in July 1832.
Teichelmann and Schürmann both enrolled in the Evangelical Lutheran Mission Society's seminary at Dresden (which later became the Leipzig Lutheran Mission) in 1836. Both men obtained their ordination as Lutheran pastors in early 1838, and travelled to South Australia on the "Pestonjee Bomanjee" later that year, arriving in Adelaide on 12 October. One of their fellow passengers happened to be George Gawler who was there to take up his appointment as the new Governor of South Australia.
Missionary and linguistic work.
Both Schürmann and Teichelmann believed that colonisation was a menace to Australian Aboriginal life and that to remedy its damaging impact, conversation had to be a two-way street, with due deference to the need to interact with native peoples in their own languages. Schürmann recounted that, while teaching the principles of Christianity he would draw analogies between the circumstances of Christ's life and those of the dispossessed Aboriginal people:-
I told them that... Jesus had been circumcised like the black men, had thought well, spoken and done well, then was hanged by his country people, but on the third day he went to heaven.
Schürmann and Teichelmann ran a school for Kaurna people at Piltawodli (located in the Adelaide Park Lands), and gained most of their knowledge of the Kaurna language from three respected elders: Mullawirraburka ("King John" / "Onkaparinga Jack"), Kadlitpinna ("Captain Jack") and Ityamaiitpinna ("[King Rodney"). They recorded around about 3000 words, a sketch grammar, hundreds of phrases and sentences along with English translations, traditional songlines, and textual illustrations of differences among dialects. They also created Kaurna translations of six German hymns as well as the Ten Commandments.
Legacy.
His 1844 dictionary of Barngarla has been used by the Barngarla community and Ghil'ad Zuckermann in the reclamation of the Barngarla language.
The records compiled by Teichelmann and Schürmann in the 1840s have proven highly valuable in projects to reconstruct the language.

History of Philippine Airlines

Philippine Airlines (PAL) is the flag carrier of the Philippines, operating from its base at Ninoy Aquino International Airport. PAL is the oldest airline in Asia operating under its original name, having been founded in 1941.
Beginnings (1930–1959).
Philippine Aerial Taxi Company.
On December 3, 1930, the Philippine Aerial Taxi Company (PATCO) was established by Emmanuel N. Bachrach. It commenced operations on March 18, 1931, with a round-trip flight from Manila to Iloilo. The company then had scheduled Manila-Baguio and Manila-Paracale flights. The company became dormant for six years on its scheduled passenger operation under its assigned routes.
Philippine Air Lines.
On February 26, 1941, Philippine Air Lines, Inc., was formally incorporated by a group of businessmen headed by Andrés Soriano Sr.. At that time, he was hailed as one of the Philippines' leading industrialists and served as the airline's general manager. Soriano and former senator Ramón J. Fernández acquired the franchise of Philippine Aerial Taxi Company, Inc. and renamed Philippine Air Lines (PAL). The airline's first flight took place on March 15, 1941, with a single Beechcraft Model 18 NPC-54 on daily services between Manila (from Nielson Field) and Baguio. It carried two pilots and five passengers on its maiden flight. The five passengers were the founders of the airline – Soriano, Fernández, Juan Miguel Elizalde, John R. Schultz and Ernesto Von Kaufmann. Government investment in September 1941 paved the way for its nationalization. On October 23, 1941, John R. Schultz was elected by the board of directors as treasurer of Philippine Air Lines.
PAL services were interrupted during World War II, which lasted in the Philippines from late 1941 to 1945. Upon the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8, 1941, the two Model 18s and its pilots were pressed into military service. They were used to evacuate American fighter pilots to Australia until one was shot down over Mindanao and the other was destroyed on the ground in an air raid in Surabaya, Indonesia.
On February 15, 1946, PAL resumed operations after a five-year hiatus with service to 15 domestic points with five Douglas DC-3s and a payroll of 108 names. Philippine Airlines returned to its original home, Nielson Field in Makati. The airport, heavily damaged during the war, was refurbished and modernized by PAL at a cost of over one million pesos, quickly becoming the official port of entry for air passengers into the Philippines. The airport was operated by Manila International Air Terminal, Inc., a wholly owned PAL subsidiary.
On July 31, 1946, PAL became the first Asian airline to cross the Pacific Ocean when a chartered Douglas DC-4 ferried 40 American servicemen to Oakland, California, from Nielson Airport with stops in Guam, Wake Island, Johnston Atoll and Honolulu. A regular service between Manila and San Francisco started in December 1946. During this time, the airline was designated as the country's flag carrier.
PAL commenced service to Europe in 1947 with the acquisition of more Douglas DC-4s. By 1948, PAL had absorbed the only other scheduled airlines in the Philippines, Far Eastern Air Transport and Commercial Air Lines. Following the government's decision to convert Nichols Field in Pasay, the site of a former U.S. Air Force base, into the new international airport for Manila, PAL was required to move its base of operations and passenger terminal there from Nielson Airport. The transfer was accomplished over a five-month period from January 31 to June 28, 1948, with PAL investing an additional P600,000 in ground installations and improvements to Nichols Field.
In 1951, PAL leased a DC-3 named "Kinsei" to Japan Airlines, which led to the founding of the country's own national airline. In March 1954, the Philippine government suspended all flights to Europe, Japan and the United States, only to resume five years later. In three years PAL started services to Hong Kong, Bangkok, and Taipei using Convair 340s that would later be replaced by the Vickers Viscount 784, which brought the airline into the turboprop age.
First expansion and modernization (1960–1989).
In the 1960s, PAL entered the jet age, initially with a lone Boeing 707, later replaced with Douglas DC-8 aircraft leased from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, used for long-haul international flights to Europe and the United States. The DC-3 remained the mainstay of domestic services as it expanded to a total of 72 points as airports were improved or opened, but most of the airline's rural air service was later stopped in May 1964. Two years later, PAL commenced its first jet services to Cebu, Bacolod, and Davao using the BAC1-11. In addition, PAL was privatized, as the Philippine government relinquished its share in PAL after Benigno Toda Jr., then-PAL chairman, acquired a majority stake in the airline.
A year after the declaration of martial law in 1972, Ferdinand Marcos, during his second presidential term, issued monopolizing decrees in the form of Letters of Instruction (LOI) nos. 151 and 151-A, which were known as the "one-airline policy". PAL was the lone surviving airline, absorbing Air Manila and Filipinas Orient Airways. On March 10, 1973, PAL was re-designated as the national flag carrier. PAL continued its expansion with the arrival of its first Douglas DC-10 in July 1974. Three years later, the Philippine government re-nationalized PAL, with the Government Service Insurance System holding a majority of PAL shares. In 1979, the Boeing 727, the Boeing 747-200B and the Airbus A300B4, dubbed the "Love Bus", joined the PAL fleet, while the PAL DC-8 fleet was retired.
In 1975, Philippine Airlines was headquartered at the PAL Building in Makati. Between 1979 and 1981, as part of a comprehensive modernization program led by then-PAL President Roman A. Cruz, PAL built a series of mammoth aviation-related facilities around the periphery of the MIA. These included the PAL Technical Center, the PAL Inflight Center, the PAL Data Center and the PAL Aviation School. In the same time period, PAL also achieved service successes, after being the first airline to be honored by Les Chaines de Rotisseurs, an ancient order of gourmets, with an award for its inflight cuisine. On January 4, 1980, The Philippine Airlines' Boeing 747-200 dubbed the "Jumbo Jet" was the first of its kind to fly across the pacific. In addition to that, PAL was also the first airline to introduce numerous fully flat bed seats in one aircraft. The 14 sleeping berths in the 747 known as "Skybeds" was certified for landing and take off. The "skybeds" were exclusive to first class in the upper deck.
On April 2, 1982, a PAL Boeing 747-200B arriving from San Francisco via Honolulu became the first aircraft to dock at the new 800-million peso Terminal 1 of Manila International Airport. PAL would later strengthen its cargo-handling capability by building a dedicated cargo terminal building adjacent to the MIA passenger terminal and installing cargo-refrigeration equipment in 1983. The new facilities, which catered mainly to international cargo services, enabled PAL to become a fully equipped cargo handler. Services to Paris and Zürich began in November 1982. 
After Cruz's resignation to President Cory Aquino on the last day of the 1986 EDSA Revolution, Dante G. Santos became PAL president. He launched a massive modernization of the domestic fleet with the acquisition of the Short 360, nicknamed the "Sunriser", in May 1987, the Fokker 50 in August 1988 and the Boeing 737-300 jet in August 1989. Corazon Aquino also abolished Marcos's one-airline policy in 1988.
As the Manila domestic passenger terminal outgrew its capacity and ramp aircraft parking space became more scarce, PAL leased the hangar of the Philippine Aerospace Development Corporation and converted it into the PAL Domestic Terminal 2. The terminal, which opened in October 1988, exclusively served passengers flying to destinations serviced by PAL's Airbus A300s: namely, Cebu and Davao, with General Santos and Puerto Princesa added later on. At the same time, PAL also expanded and improved the existing terminal. The opening of the new facility cleared out the old terminal and provided greater convenience to passengers.
Re-privatization and second expansion (1990–1997).
PAL was privatized again in January 1992, when the government sold a 67% share of PAL to a holding company called "PR Holdings". However, a conflict as to who would lead PAL led to a compromise in 1993, when former Agriculture Secretary Carlos G. Dominguez was elected as the PAL president by the airline's board of directors. The fleet of BAC1-11s were retired in May 1992, following the completion of the deliveries of Boeing 737s, and the Short 360s in September. In November 1993, PAL acquired its first Boeing 747-400. The new aircraft arrived at Subic Bay International Airport and was carrying then-President Fidel V. Ramos, who was headed home from the United States after an official visit. The 400-ton aircraft, one of the world's largest and most popular long-range aircraft was a mainstay of PAL's trans-Pacific services and its flagship aircraft until it was retired in 2014. A new service between Manila and Osaka, launched in 1994, brought to 34 the number of points in PAL's international route network.
The PAL Domestic Terminal 2 was refurbished in 1995, with a number of facilities being added or improved, including a renovated Mabuhay Lounge, an exclusive check-in counter for Mabuhay Class passengers, an express counter, refreshment bar, a medical clinic, an expansive waiting lounge and two baggage carousels in the arrival section. PAL facilities at NAIA were also renovated. The total cost for the renovation of the domestic terminal (1 and 2) reached P33.15 million.
In January 1995, Lucio C. Tan, the majority shareholder of PR Holdings, became the new chairman and CEO of the airline. The delivery of the carrier's fourth Boeing 747-400 in April 1996 signaled the start of an ambitious US$4 billion modernization and re-fleeting program that aimed to make PAL one of Asia's best airlines within three years. The centerpiece of the program was the acquisition of 36 state-of-the-art aircraft from Airbus and Boeing between 1996 and 1999. The re-fleeting sought to give PAL the distinction of having the youngest fleet in Asia and allow the expansion of its domestic and international route network. The 36 orders of PAL during its re-fleeting program were for eight Boeing 747-400's, four Airbus A340-300's, two Airbus A340-200s, eight Airbus A330-300's and twelve Airbus A320-200's. The re-fleeting program enabled PAL to be dubbed the first airline in the world to operate the full range of new-generation Airbus aircraft.
Asian financial crisis (1997–1999).
In 1997, PAL rebranded itself as "Asia's sunniest airline" to cap its new marketing and advertising thrust. PAL also commenced services to New York City, using the Newark Liberty International Airport via Vancouver International Airport. The acquisition of too many aircraft matched with unprofitable routes forced the airline to be financially unstable. The re-fleeting program was about halfway through when the full impact of the 1997 Asian financial crisis struck the airline industry early in 1998. By March 31, 1999, PAL dismantled its Mactan–Cebu International Airport hub. With massive lay-offs also taking place, disputes between the airline's owners and the employee's union led to a complete shutdown of PAL's operations on September 23, 1998. Cathay Pacific temporarily took over PAL's domestic and international operations during its fourteen-day shutdown, with Cathay Pacific also showing interest in acquiring a 40-percent stake in PAL during this period. However, no agreement was reached with the Hong Kong-based airline.
PAL resumed operations on October 7, 1998, after an agreement between PAL employees and top management, reported to be facilitated by Philippine President Joseph Estrada, was reached, with services to 15 domestic points out of Manila. On October 29, the flag carrier resumed international services with flights to Los Angeles and San Francisco, with other international services being restored three weeks later. Asian services resumed on November 11 with flights to Tokyo and Hong Kong. PAL gradually expanded its network over the next two months, restoring services to Taipei, Osaka (via Cebu), Singapore, Fukuoka, Dhahran, Riyadh and Seoul. With the aviation industry still in the doldrums, PAL continued to search for a strategic partner, but in the end, it submitted a "standalone" rehabilitation plan to the SEC on December 7, 1998. The plan provides a sound basis for the airline to undertake a recovery on its own while keeping the door open to the entry of a strategic partner in the future. PAL presented the new proposed rehabilitation plan to its major creditors during a two-week marathon meeting that started on February 14 in Washington D.C. and ended on March 1 in Hong Kong.
In 1999, PAL submitted its amended rehabilitation plan to the Securities and Exchange Commission that comprised a revised business plan and a revised financial restructuring plan. The plan also required the infusion of US$200 million in new equity, with 40% to 60% coming from financial investors and translating to no less than 90% ownership of PAL. That same year, with the unprecedented boom in air travel, PAL operations were moved to the then-new Terminal 2 of Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The terminal, named as the Centennial Terminal in commemoration of 100 years of Philippine independence, is located at the site of the original MIA terminal building from 1961 to 1972. On August 9, 1999, PAL moved selected domestic flights to the P5.3 billion terminal. Full domestic operations operated from the new terminal on August 10, while international services followed soon after, thus consolidating PAL's flight operations in one terminal for the first time.
Receivership and rehabilitation (2000–2008).
In 2000, PAL finally returned to profitability, making some ₱44.2 million in its first year of rehabilitation, breaking some six years of heavy losses. On September 1, 2000, PAL formally handed over its ownership of its maintenance and engineering division to German-led joint venture Lufthansa Technik Philippines (LTP), the world's largest provider of aircraft maintenance services in accordance with the provisions of its rehabilitation plan, which mandates the disposal of the airline's non-core assets. In August of the same year, PAL opened an e-mail booking facility. In 2001, PAL continued to gain a net profit of P419 million in its second year of rehabilitation. In that year alone, PAL restored services to Bangkok, Taipei, Sydney, Busan, Jakarta, Vancouver and Ho Chi Minh City, while launching new services to Shanghai and Melbourne. A year later, PAL restored services to Guam and Tagbilaran.
Like other airlines, PAL was severely affected by the September 11 attacks in 2001. In 2003, PAL was restructured again.
The Mabuhay Miles frequent flyer program was launched in 2002, combining PAL's former frequent flyer programs, PALSmiles, Mabuhay Club, and the Flying Sportsman (now SportsPlus) all into one. The PAL RHUSH (Rapid Handling of Urgent Shipments) Cargo service was also re-launched during the same year. An online arrival and departure facility and a new booking system was then launched in 2003. In December, PAL also acquired a fifth Boeing 747-400.
In 2004, PAL launched services to Las Vegas to mark its 63rd year of service. PAL also returned to Laoag and started services to Macau on codeshare with Air Macau. In that same year, the PAL entered into code share agreements with Air France and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines for services to Paris and Amsterdam, respectively. Code share service to Paris was cut due to the merging of the two European airlines and the formation of Air France-KLM. Service to Amsterdam remained, operated by KLM. PAL also continued an overhaul of its fleet with the arrival of two new Airbus A320-214s and continued modernizing its ticketing systems with the launch of electronic ticketing. For the first time in Philippine history, the airline flew President-elect Gloria Macapagal Arroyo and Vice-President-elect, now ABS-CBN journalist Noli de Castro to their inauguration in Cebu City. Arroyo rode a chartered PAL Airbus A330-300, while de Castro was aboard a separate Airbus A320-200.
In March 2005, PAL started services to Nagoya and restored scheduled flights to Beijing after a 15-year hiatus. In response to rival Cebu Pacific's increasing domestic market share, mainly due to its massive re-fleeting program and its own aging Boeing 737 fleet, PAL signed an agreement for the purchase and lease of up to 18 Airbus A319-112s and A320-214s from Airbus and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS) on December 6, 2005.
The first brand-new, GECAS-leased Airbus A319-112s were delivered to and inaugurated by PAL and President Arroyo on October 20, 2006. It was the first aircraft in the airline's history to offer AVOD-capable inflight entertainment on its Mabuhay Class cabin. In December, the airline initiated its wide-body re-fleeting program by signing a deal with Boeing for the purchase of two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft to be delivered in 2009, with an option for two more planes in 2011. PAL also signed a separate agreement with GECAS to lease another two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft for delivery in 2010. The purchase of the new 777-300ERs effectively cancelled previous orders for new 747-400s, ending the production of said aircraft. PAL later signed a memorandum of understanding that opens the way for the introduction of flights to the southwestern Chinese city of Chongqing. Service to Chongqing began on March 14, 2008, while service to Chengdu commenced on March 18, though the routes have been terminated after the 2008 Sichuan earthquake.
Philippine Airlines was named "Airline Turnaround of the Year" for 2006 and 2007 by the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation for its "strategic contribution to the aviation industry through a significant transformation by successfully restructuring its operations through innovative cost-cutting measures resulting in operating profits".
Post-receivership history (2008–2011).
On October 4, 2007, nine years after being financially crippled by the Asian financial crisis and subsequent downturns in the aviation industry, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered the release of PAL from receivership. The airline immediately announced plans to attract foreign investments through an international road show to tour around Asia, Europe and North America. PAL continued its ambitious expansion plans, launching regional subsidiary PAL Express on April 10, 2008, to supersede the financially troubled Air Philippines, with a $150 million order for three 50-seat Bombardier Q300 and six 78-seat Bombardier Q400 aircraft from Bombardier Aerospace. PAL Express operations began on 5 May with eight flights daily between Manila and Malay, while hub operations from Cebu City commenced on 19 May with flights between Cebu and five points in the Visayas and Mindanao. Services to other destinations, including many destinations formerly served by PAL prior to the Asian financial crisis, began in June and July 2008. PAL Express was originally to be primarily based in Cebu and fly intra-regional routes in the Visayas and Mindanao, as well as secondary routes to smaller airports in island provinces. In response to rising competition from Cebu Pacific and Zest Airways, PAL Express rebranded itself as Airphil Express on March 28, 2010, under a low-cost model. PAL decided to restore the PAL Express name as part of expansion strategy, effectively rendering the Airphil Express brand defunct on March 15, 2013.
Despite PAL's successful exit from receivership, international safety concerns regarding the Philippine aviation industry severely hindered its expansion plans. The United States Federal Aviation Administration downgraded the Philippines' aviation industry from Category 1 to Category 2 in January 2008, preventing PAL from increasing its flights to the United States from 33 per week or from switching the type of aircraft used unless the airline undertakes a wet-lease agreement with a different carrier. The FAA decision effectively stalled PAL's previously announced intentions to expand its presence in the US market with routes to San Diego, Seattle, Chicago, Saipan and New York City. On March 30, 2010, Philippines-based carriers were placed in an EU aviation blacklist (no longer true as of 2019), banning PAL from flying to any European destinations. Since 2013, PAL is no longer in the blacklist. Nonetheless, PAL continued its route expansion plans in the Asia-Pacific region, resuming services to Riyadh with a four times weekly Boeing 747 service four years after it was suspended, as well as adding a twice weekly Airbus A330 service to Brisbane and three-times-weekly service to Delhi via Bangkok. However, the expansion proved unprofitable and all three routes were cancelled. Flights to Brisbane and Riyadh were suspended in 2011, and the Manila-Bangkok-Delhi route ended in 2013; however service to Brisbane and Riyadh resumed in the same year. 
Despite these hindrances on its expansion, PAL went ahead with its widebody re-fleeting program, receiving its first two Boeing 777-300ER aircraft on November 19, 2009, and January 2010 respectively, and another two leased from GECAS in 2010. Due to the inability for PAL to further expand its long-haul network, the airline launched 777 service to its existing long-haul routes including Tokyo, Los Angeles and Vancouver. The 777-300ER jet features 370 seats in a two-class configuration (42 flat business class seats in a 2-3-2 layout and 328 economy class seats in a 3-4-3 layout), and is also PAL's first aircraft to feature AVOD in-flight entertainment in all classes (later retrofitted in its 747-400 fleet).
Labor disputes.
In July 2010, 25 of Philippine Airlines' pilots resigned and left to seek employment abroad without informing the airline. After calls to return to work by both the airline and Philippine Government, PAL subsequently sought to file charges against the pilots involved for breach of contract. In the same month, PAL announced that it would be outsourcing jobs, with retrenchments resulting. Disputes with flight attendants, ground crew, airport staff as well as reservation agents escalated, with threats of potentially disruptive strike action, which took place in October. On Friday, November 12, 2010, the Department of Labor and Employment approved the lay-off of 2600 employees of Philippine Airlines.
Entry of San Miguel Corporation (2012–2014).
On April 4, 2012, San Miguel Corporation bought a 49-percent stake in Philippine Airlines for $500 million as part of a strategy to move away from its beer and food businesses. San Miguel, one of the Philippines' biggest conglomerates, said it planned to help modernise and strengthen PAL, renew its aging fleet and restore its competitiveness in the Asian aviation industry. San Miguel president Ramon Ang also announced intentions to join a global airline alliance. PAL's first major initiative under San Miguel ownership was confirmed on August 28, 2012, with a $7 billion order for 54 Airbus aircraft, comprising 44 Airbus A321 (34 with sharklets and 10 A321neo) and 10 Airbus A330-300, with options for 10 more. The A321 was ordered to enhance domestic and regional routes, while the A330-300s are to be flown on Australian, Middle Eastern and some European routes. PAL's original fleet of 8 A330s were transferred to PAL Express in response to Cebu Pacific announcing intentions to compete with PAL on mid-to-long-haul routes. PAL exercised its option to purchase a further 10 A330-300 for $2.5 billion on September 28. PAL took delivery of its first aircraft under this order in 2013.
Under San Miguel's management, PAL embarked on expanding its route network, involving both adding new and restoring previously terminated routes. In 2013, the airline announced its return to Abu Dhabi, Dammam and Riyadh, and launched new routes to Brisbane and Perth (via Darwin), as well as Doha and Jeddah. In 2013, PAL was removed from the EU aviation blacklist after three years of negotiations, and the carrier immediately announced its European plans. PAL subsequently launched flights between Manila and Heathrow to commence in November 2013, its first European destination in 15 years. The airline will expand its US service as they will open flights from Manila to New York via Vancouver.
In addition to its fleet modernization and route expansion, PAL announced plans to become an investor within the aviation industry following the San Miguel partial acquisition. In 2012, the airline entered into negotiations with Cayman Airways for a 50 percent equity share in the Caribbean-based airline. Under the deal, Cayman Airways will issue new preferred shares to PAL's majority shareholder, San Miguel Corporation. As part of the proposed scheme, Cayman Airways will use the fresh capital to acquire new aircraft which will then be leased out to Philippine Airlines under a wet lease agreement. The planes will be registered and domiciled in the Cayman Islands, and to be flown, operated and maintained completely by Cayman Airways. In 2013, PAL entered a joint venture with the Cambodian conglomerate Royal Group of Cambodia, headed by Kith Meng to launch a new incarnation Cambodia Airlines with a 49% share. The new airline was originally expected to commence operations by June 2013, however no services have been launched as of September.
On August 30, 2012, PAL president Ramon Ang announced its intention to build a second international airport to service Metro Manila. Citing the need to relieve pressure on the congested and outdated Ninoy Aquino International Airport and the unreasonable 90 km distance from the Philippine government's favoured second airport option at Clark, Ang announced that the airline was in negotiations with a Korean contractor to build the airport on a 2000-hectare site, initially with two runways, eventually expanding to four, in a yet-undisclosed location north of Metro Manila. In March 2013, PAL postponed the project indefinitely citing government restrictions on airline corporate ownership of Philippine airports. However, on July 12, 2013, Ang stated that PAL was 'still looking to build' a new airport and were '100% sure' that the project would eventuate, although plans had yet to be finalised.
In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on September 8, 2014, San Miguel stated that it has signed an agreement "whereby [San Miguel] expressed willingness to sell its 49% stake to the group of Dr. Lucio Tan, and the latter has expressed willingness to buy the said 49% stake." It added the deal is "subject to the fulfillment of certain conditions." Informed sources said San Miguel gave Tan a week to raise $1 billion to acquire the stake. The final transaction amounted to $1.3 billion and was completed a week later on September 15, 2014. In a disclosure to the Philippine Stock Exchange on September 16, 2014, San Miguel said Tan assumed day-to-day management of PAL through the appointment of its former president, Jaime Bautista, as general manager. However, it maintained that Ang, as president of PAL, remains, along with the rest of his team, "until the relevant closing date of the agreement" between the parties. On October 15, 2014, Ang officially stepped down as president and COO.
Return of Lucio Tan and continued expansion (2014–2020).
On October 23, 2014, Philippine Airlines announced the appointment of Bautista as the new president and COO of Philippine Airlines. Under Bautista's rule, Philippine Airlines deferred the deliveries of the Airbus A321neo that was supposed to be delivered from November 2017, under the San Miguel management. The strategic move minimised the risk of an overcapacity with single aisle aircraft in the PAL fleet. Jaime Bautista also announced plans to replace its A340 fleet, with the choice of a new and modern Airbus A350 XWB or Boeing 787 Dreamliner. In addition to new aircraft, PAL has chosen to lease more 777s for its growing long haul flights.
In January 2015, Philippine Airlines became the official carrier of Pope Francis throughout his apostolic trip in the Philippines. The aircraft boarded by the pontiff was named "Shepherd One". The airline flew the pope to the city of Tacloban and, as per traditional protocol, flew him back to Ciampino Airport in Rome, Italy from Manila.
In March 2015, coinciding with the 74th anniversary of the carrier, Philippine Airlines resumed flights to New York City via the John F. Kennedy International Airport with a stopover in Vancouver from Manila. The airline previously flew to New York via Newark Liberty International Airport, but canceled the route in 1997 following the Asian financial crisis. Philippine Airlines originally utilized the Airbus A340 for its flights, but in October 2015, PAL upgraded its Boeing 747-400 order to the larger Boeing 777-300ER to increase seat capacity for flights to New York. In addition, Philippine Airlines expanded to the Oceania region by introducing flights to Auckland, New Zealand (via Cairns, Australia) and Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea. Philippine Airlines' global expansion and new routes also made the airline among nine out of the sixteen publicly traded Southeast Asian carriers to be profitable, having kept a $120 million profit. It was ranked the fourth profitable overall and second profitable full-service carrier in Southeast Asia, according to the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation.
In June 2015, Philippine Airlines renewed its partnership with Lufthansa Technik Philippines for a two-year base and heavy maintenance checks for its Airbus fleet.
In 2016, Philippine Airlines announced the launching of flights between Manila and Doha, Manila and Kuwait City (via Dubai), and Cebu City to Los Angeles.
In April 2016, on Philippine Airlines' 75th anniversary, the airline introduced a new campaign called "The Heart of the Filipino". The campaign was aggressively undertaken, with the launch of new advertisements which are endorsed by "The Voice of the Philippines" judges: singers Bamboo Mañalac, Lea Salonga, and Sarah Geronimo, as well as the Miss Universe 2015 winner, Pia Wurtzbach. The airline adopted a new theme song, which incorporates the vocals of Mañalac, Salonga, and Geronimo. The lyrics famously includes the old PAL slogan "Shining Through," reminiscing on PAL's successful campaign in the 1980s. The airline also released a new pre-flight safety demonstration video in conjunction with "The Heart of the Filipino" campaign, called "Heart of The Nation", in February 2017. The video featured various tourist destinations in the Philippines with locals from those destinations demonstrating the safety guidelines.
Philippine Airlines continued its expansion by augmenting its international and domestic flights. The airline started flying to Nanning and Sapporo, and non-stop flights to Brisbane, New York City, Perth, Toronto. There are also plans to introduce new flights to New Delhi and Mumbai. The airline also launched new flights to Clark, making Clark International Airport its second hub after Mactan–Cebu International Airport. However, the airline indefinitely suspended flights to Kuwait, Jeddah, and Darwin, as well as the route from Cebu City to Los Angeles, citing low demand.
Continuing with its fleet expansion, Philippine Airlines acquired new aircraft to serve its new routes. The airline received its 9th and 10th Boeing 777-300ER in 2017. The airline also acquired six new Airbus A350-900 with options for six more. The first A350 was delivered on July 14, 2018, with the other A350s being delivered subsequently. Both aircraft were used for international, long-haul flights. The airline also acquired the Airbus A321neo (with a standard and long-range variant) and Bombardier Q400, the former used for regional flights and the latter used for domestic flights. The airline also announced its intention to acquire the Airbus A350-1000, the largest variant of Airbus A350. The airline retired its Airbus A340 aircraft, the airline being the last to use the aircraft in Asia, and some of its Airbus A320ceo, with some transferred to its subsidiary, PAL express.
With improvements to its existing fleet, facilities, and services, along with its continued fleet modernization and expansion, the airline was certified with a four-star rating from Skytrax, joining 40 other airlines, after an audit made in December 2017. PAL was also awarded a 4-star certification by APEX on September 26, 2018, and was considered the Most Improved Airline of 2019 by AirlineRatings.com.
The airline signed agreements with companies such as Amadeus to upgrade its core technology system, and Lufthansa Technik Philippines to maintain its aircraft for 12 years. PAL also signed an agreement with the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on September 28, 2018, to give travel privileges to all AFP military personnel in the form of discounted domestic economy or business class tickets.
On January 29, 2019, All Nippon Airways purchased a 9.5% stake on the airline's holding company, PAL Holdings, for US$95 million.
On February 20, 2019, Philippine Airlines took delivery of its fifth Airbus A350, with the iconic "Love Bus" symbol, commemorating its forty years of partnership with aircraft manufacturer, Airbus.
On June 18, 2019, Philippine Airlines announced the appointment of Lucio Tan's daughter, Vivienne as the new executive vice president and OIC following the retirement of president and COO Jaime Bautista.
On July 29, 2019, Philippine Airlines appointed Gilbert Santa Maria as the new president and COO, replacing Jaime Bautista. Viviene Tan was reassigned as the head of audit.
COVID-19 pandemic (2020–present).
In February 2020, Philippine Airlines decided to lay off 300 of its workers due to financial losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
On March 15, 2020, it was announced that all domestic flights in and out of Manila would be suspended due to the rising number of coronavirus cases in the Philippines.
On March 17, 2020, it was announced that all domestic flights in the Philippines would be suspended. The airline later stopped all international flights on March 26.
On April 7, 2020, PAL arranged for two flights to take UK residents back to the UK on a Boeing 777-300ER. Given the extension of the Luzon quarantine, PAL announced that it would continue to not fly any planes until April 30 and therefore would aim to start up flights again on 1 May. PAL arranged two flights to bring back passengers who were eligible given entry restrictions: one from Vancouver, and the other from Toronto.
On March 15, 2021, Philippine Airlines celebrated its 80th anniversary.
On May 11, 2021, it was reported that Philippine Airlines would file a bankruptcy, Chapter 11 by the end of May due to the impact brought by the pandemic, with the airline also said that they were undergoing "restructuring".
In August 2021, PAL reported a loss in the first half of 2021. The airline returned one Airbus A321-200 and one Airbus A350-900 to its lessor, and the delivery of new aircraft for the airline originally scheduled for 2020 and 2021 was postponed to 2026 until 2030. It was also reported that PAL's filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has been further delayed. 
Amid mounting debts, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection at a New York court on September 4, 2021. It cancelled more than 80,000 flights, wiping out US$2 billion in revenue, and let go of 2,300 employees.

Blattoidea is a superfamily of cockroaches and termites in the order Blattodea. There are about 17 families and more than 4,100 described species in Blattoidea.
The 12 families of termites are sometimes considered members of the suborder Isoptera, but recent phylogenetic analysis places them within the cockroach superfamily Blattoidea. Within Blattoidea, the termites are grouped under the epifamily Termitoidae.
The great coal deposits of the Carboniferous Period have been attributed in part to the lack of wood-consuming insects such as blattoids, which do not appear in the fossil record until the late Carboniferous.

Count Elliott

Count Elliott (also spelled Count Eliot) was a hereditary title in the Holy Roman Empire held by the Eliot military family. The title encompassed Count of the Holy Roman Empire, Comte de Morhange, and Graf von Port Eliot.
History.
In 1735 Granville Elliott was set to marry Jeanne Thérèse du Han, Comtesse de Martigny and lady of honour to the Empress of Germany. Prior to their wedding Emperor Charles VI created him Comte de Morhange and he was made a Chamberlain to the Emperor. Over time he eventually became a Count of the Holy Roman Empire.
Granville spent a significant amount of time attempting to prove that Richard Eliot and Catherine Killigrew had married prior to the birth of their son George Elliott. If this were true, it would make Granville the rightful heir to Sir John Eliot and thus Port Eliot, the ancestral home of the Eliot Family and seat of the Earl of St Germans. Despite his attempt failing Granville was given the title Graf von Port Eliot. Upon his death in 1759 the titles where passed to his oldest living son Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott.
In 1808, after the fall of the Holy Roman Empire, the title Count of the Empire was transferred to the German Empire. Without an heir, Amable Gaspard Antoine Elliott chose his half brother Francis Perceval Eliot to succeed him. Francis thought being in French and German nobility would be improper and died in 1818 without assuming the titles.

Pentaerythritol tetrakis(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyhydrocinnamate) is a chemical compound composed of 4 sterically hindered phenols linked through a pentaerythritol core. It is used as primary antioxidant for stabilizing polymers, particularly polyethylene and polypropylene.
Synthesis.
It may be produced by the transesterification of 3-(3,5-ditert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoate esters with pentaerythritol.
Properties.
The linking of phenols together with pentaerythritol maintains their activity with greatly reduced volatility. This is important during the processing and molding steps where the plastic is heated to molten, typically several hundred degrees.

Swedish Engineer Troops

The Swedish Engineer Troops (, I) is the engineer branch of the Swedish Army. The Troops were formed after the Defence Act of 1936. Today, it consists of a single unit, the Göta Engineer Regiment (Ing 2) and two schools, the Swedish Army Field Work School ("Fältarbetsskolan", FarbS) and the EOD School ("Amröjskolan", AmröjS)
History.
In the 1600s and 1700s, special engineer (or pioneer units) were organized. "Fortifikationen" ("Royal Engineers") were established in 1635 as a special corps for construction of fortifications. The task of "Fortifikationen" was to build and maintain the country's land and coastal fortifications and other military buildings. In 1811, the "Fortifikationen" was amalgamated with the Field Surveying Corps ("Fältmätningskåren") to the Engineer Corps ("Ingenjörskåren"). This consisted, among other things, of a fortification brigade. In 1867 the Engineer Corps was renamed the "Fortifikationen". From 1855, sapper companies, a pontoon battalion, a field-signaling company and engineer troops were added to the "Fortifikationen". The service branch expanded greatly towards the late 1800s, and in 1901 there were four corps; the Svea Engineer Corps (Ing 1), Göta Engineer Corps (Ing 2), Field Telegraph Corps (Ing 3), and Boden Engineer Corps (Ing 4).
According to the Defence Act of 1925, the Swedish Engineer Troops now came to consist of two field engineering corps (Svea and Göta, located in Stockholm and Eksjö), the Field Telegraph Corps (Stockholm) and Boden Engineer Corps. Svea Engineer Corps was organized on a corps staff, two field engineering companies, two military bridge companies, a fortress engineering company (Vaxholm) and a ordnance (sapper) company. Göta Engineer Corps was organized on a corps staff, three field engineering companies, a military bridge company, a fortress engineering company (Karlskrona) and a ordnance (sapper) company. The Field Telegraph Corps was organized on corps staff, two field telegraph companies, two radio companies and an ordnance company. The Boden Engineer Corps was organized on a corps staff, a field engineering company, a fortress engineering company, a military bridge company, a telegraph company and a ordnance (sapper) company.
The Swedish Engineer Troops constituted after the Defence Act of 1936 a special service branch, including three engineer corps: Svea Engineer Corps (Ing 1) in Solna, Göta Engineer Corps (Ing 2) in Eksjö and Boden Engineer Corps (Ing 4, later Ing 3) in Boden. It was established when the "Fortifikationen" was split into the Swedish Engineer Troops, Swedish Army Signal Troops and the Swedish Fortification Corps. A school to train officers in the engineer troops and to train other officers in the field working service was established in 1943 under the name Engineer Troop School ("Ingenjörtruppskolan", IngS). It changed its name in 1952 to the Swedish Army School of Field Works ("Arméns fältarbetsskola", FältarbS). On 1 June 1981 the Swedish Engineers [Cadet and] Officer Candidate School ("Ingenjörtruppernas kadett- och aspirantskola", IngKAS) was amalgamated with the Swedish Army School of Field Works. It ceased and was part of the Swedish Army Field Works Center ("Arméns fältarbetscentrum", FarbC) from 1 July 1991.
The Swedish Army Field Works Center was disbanded in 1997 and the Swedish Army Field Work School ("Fältarbetsskolan", FarbS) continued operations together with the EOD School ("Amröjskolan", AmröjS), both sorting under Göta Engineer Regiment (Ing 2) which since 2005 is the only remaining active engineer unit in the Swedish Engineer Troops.
Inspector of the Swedish Engineer Troops.
The head of the Engineer Troops was called "Ingenjörinspektören" ("Inspector of the Swedish Engineer Troops"). In the years 1966-1991, the Engineer Troops and the Signal Troops had a joint branch inspector; the Inspector of the Swedish Army Engineer Corps and Signal Corps ("Ingenjörinspektör- och Signalinspektören"). From 1991, the two branches received an inspector each, and the title of the engineer troops was shortened to the Engineer Inspector. In connection with the decommissioning of Swedish Army Field Work Center ("Arméns fältarbetscentrum"), the position of Engineer Inspector disappeared.

Franka Rasmussen

Franziska Paula Konstante Rasmussen née Duden (1907–1994) was a German-born textile artist and painter who moved to Denmark in 1930. Initially influenced by the minimalist Bauhaus style, she soon developed her own distinctive Structuralist approach to weaving, becoming one of Denmark's most important contributors to tapestry. In 1935, she joined the Danish School of Arts and Crafts ("Kunsthåndværkerskole") where she remained for over 40 years, teaching painting and composition, increasingly with an emphasis on textile art.
Biography.
Born on 20 March 1907 in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, Franziska Paula Konstante Duden was the daughter of the German business executive Paul Duden (1868–1954) and his wife Johanne Bertha Nebe (died 1935). The youngest of five children, she was brought up in a well-to-do family; her father, a member of the executive board of the chemical firm Hoechst, was an amateur painter, while her mother came from a family of academics. Her grandfather Konrad Duden was a linguist and founder of the well-known German language dictionary bearing his name. After attending courses in painting, Franka Duden studied at the "Kunstgewerbeschule" (School of Arts and Crafts) in Frankfurt (1928–29), where she met her future husband, the painter Peter Christian Rasmussen (1897–1935). They married in 1930.
After Paul Rasmussen had accepted a position at the newly established "Kunsthåndværkerskole" (Arts and Crafts School) in Copenhagen, the couple moved to Denmark. While her husband was teaching, Franka created paintings and textiles in her studio. Initially she adopted the simplistic Bauhaus idiom but soon began to develop her own artistic style. After her husband's premature death in 1935, Rasmussen began to teach herself, obtaining a permanent position at the Arts and Crafts School in 1940. She turned out to be an excellent pedagogue, constantly encouraging her students to develop their own artistic styles.
Assisted by her colleague Gunilla Lagerbjelke, Rasmussen's work became increasingly based on textiles. Her earlier tapestries and woven creations were inspired by nature but they evolved towards experimental, structuralistically formatted designs, often made of coarse yarns.
She held solo exhibitions from 1954 and was one of the few Danes to be represented at the Textile Biennale in Lausanne in 1967.
Franka Rasmussen died in Copenhagen on 14 December 1994.
Awards.
In addition to a number of grants and scholarships, Rasmussen received the Eckersberg Medal in 1982.

Do Not Send Us Astray

"Do Not Send Us Astray" is the thirteenth episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on March 25, 2018. It was written by Angela Kang and Matthew Negrete, and directed by Jeffrey F. January. It also features the final appearance of Tobin (Jason Douglas).
Plot.
Having taken over leadership of the Saviors following Negan's disappearance, Simon (Steven Ogg) leads the Saviors' convoy to the Hilltop, now intent on wiping out any survivors rather than trying to coerce them into submission as Negan wanted. The convoy's traverse is noticed by Hilltop scouts and the community begins preparing for the imminent attack. When the Savior convoy reaches the community at night, Maggie (Lauren Cohan) contacts Simon over walkie-talkie, warning him that she will personally execute all of the Savior prisoners that they still hold captive, should he mobilize an attack. Simon says the prisoners are no longer members of the Saviors since they were captured, much to the prisoners dismay. As they exchange words, Daryl (Norman Reedus) suddenly arrives, riding up on his motorcycle, and starts opening fire at the Saviors with a machine gun, forcing them to start their attack on the Hilltop; the battle begins in earnest.
Prepared for the attack, the Hilltop soldiers attack the Saviors from highly defensible positions, taking out several of their numbers. In the midst of the chaos, Simon takes Dwight (Austin Amelio) to work their way behind the attackers. Inside the community, Simon spots Tara (Alanna Masterson) and begins to hunt her down. However, Dwight, who has secretly sided against the Saviors, shoots Tara in the shoulder with an untainted arrow, saving her from being killed by Simon. Meanwhile, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his other forces charge in from the outside, chasing out the remaining Saviors.
The next day, the Hilltop community bury their dead and tend to their wounded, unaware that the Saviors had coated their weapons in walker viscera for the attack. Among those injured is Tobin (Jason Douglas), Carol's (Melissa McBride) former boyfriend from Alexandria. Elsewhere, Rick reveals to Maggie (Lauren Cohan) that he had attempted to kill Negan just before the attack but failed and feels some responsibility for how this attack went. Daryl accuses Tara of trusting Dwight after having seen him as part of Simon's forces and escaping with the other Saviors, but Tara insists Dwight is still loyal to them. Morgan (Lennie James) starts having visions of Gavin (Jayson Warner Smith), a dead Savior lieutenant he was intent on killing but could not, who was then unexpectedly killed by Henry (Macsen Lintz).
That night, those infected by walker blood, including Tobin, succumb to the infection and turn into walkers, attacking the sleeping residents of the Hilltop. The remaining residents react quickly to put down the walkers, with Carol herself stabbing the reanimated Tobin in the head. Concurrently, Henry accosts the Savior prisoners with a gun, demanding to know which one of them killed his older brother, Benjamin. When none of them respond, Henry unlocks the pen and enters to threaten them directly. However, one of the prisoners, who had also been hit by walker-coated weapons, reanimates and starts attacking them. In the confusion, another Savior, Jared (Joshua Mikel), wrestles the gun from Henry and leads the other Saviors, as well as Gregory (Xander Berkeley), to escape from the Hilltop during the turmoil.
When dawn breaks, Maggie oversees more burials of their friends. They discover the missing Savior prisoners, though a few, led by Alden (Callan McAuliffe), offer to stay and help the Hilltop even though they know they will still be treated as prisoners. Additionally, Carol and Morgan go to search for Henry, who appears to have disappeared.
Development.
This episode features the death of the recurring character Tobin, portrayed by Jason Douglas, who has been on the series since the episode "Forget" from the fifth season. In an interview Douglas said: "Up until the moment I found out, I had no clue that it was imminent, but I've always been expecting it."

Ekhoni

Ekhoni (also "Ekhonee"; English: "Right Now") is a 1971 Bengali film directed by Tapan Sinha, starring Aparna Sen, Moushumi Chatterjee, Chinmoy Roy and others. Based on an award-winning novel of the same name by Ramapada Chowdhury, "Ekhoni" was one of the earliest films to address the problems of urban youth, and to replace the individual hero by a collective protagonist. At the 19th National Film Awards, it won the National Award for Best Screenplay. It also won two BFJA Awards.
Synopsis.
The film follows a group of young, college-going men and women. They spend much of their time hanging out at a downbeat tea shop. There are romantic involvements and clashes with their parents and other family members. Most of all, these young people feel a sense of uncertainty about the future. Urmi (Aparna Sen) is from an affluent family and has a fiancé who is an engineer. All the others are from middle-class families. Arun (Swaroop Dutta) resents being made to run small errands for his parents. Halfway through the film, the graduation ceremony of the class takes place. As they listen to the platitudes being dished out from the stage, it is brought home to them that their carefree student days are over. Sujit (Mrinal Mukherjee) is in a relationship with Runu (Moushumi Chatterjee). However, they can't think of marriage until he has a job. He goes for a job interview which turns into a nightmare. Urmi invites the whole group to her place for high tea, and introduces them to her fiancé (Subhendu Chatterjee in a special appearance). Her friends are impressed by the big house and the refined lifestyle. However, the evening only reinforces their feeling of uncertainty about the future. Soon after the tea-party, it is discovered that Arun's mother has brain cancer. Meanwhile, Biman's girl friend Nandini runs away from home, and declares that she won't go back. The whole group pools in efforts to get the couple married and find them a temporary place to live in. Tiklu, who appears to be unromantic, even cynical, diverts money from his family's printing business to help the couple, and is mercilessly beaten up. Arun and Urmi have a long conversation about life and love. Sujit stuns the group by announcing that he has landed a job. They have a celebration party at Biman and Nandini's place. Soon after, Arun's mother dies. A few days later, Arun gets a phone call from Urmi, asking him to meet her urgently. She informs him that she is pregnant, and that her fiancé has abandoned her and gone off to England. She asks him for help to "get rid of it". Arun thinks long into the night, and tells her that their friends will pick her up next morning in a taxi. When Urmi gets off the cab, she is surprised to find that they are not in an abortion clinic, but an office building. Arun tells her that they have an appointment with the registrar of marriages. Urmi protests that she has no intention of burdening him with another man's child. Arun confesses that he has always been in love with her. They get married and prepare to face an uncertain future together.
Cast.
The film has an ensemble cast:
Reception.
After "Apanjan", "Ekhoni" was the second film by Tapan Sinha to deal with urban issues. According to one reviewer, it "created a stir in the society". In any case, it was popular at the time, since young urban viewers could identify with the protagonists. As in the earlier film, the unexpected use of Rabindrasangeet in the film added to its attraction.
The film also enjoyed critical success, winning a National Award and two BFJA Awards. Aparna Sen lists "Ekhoni" as one of the films she cherishes having acted in.
Scholar Moinak Biswas writes: " The emergence of a collective protagonist - the unemployed, angry youth, roaming the urban landscape, temporarily displacing and probably permanently changing the nature of the individual male hero and the romantic couple, signaled a major shift in the practice of cinema across the art-popular divide." He adds: "The character galleries that Sinha creates in Apanjan, and in some ways
more poignantly in Ekhoni and Raja, are memorable archives of the times."
Preservation.
The negative of the film is not available in complete form. According to Anindya Sinha, Tapan Sinha's son, the version that is available has only 40 minutes of the movie. However, there is a version uploaded on YouTube, which, although not of good quality, appears to have close to the full running length. It is not clear whether the company under whose imprint it is uploaded has acquired the rights to this digital version.

Joseph Adkins

Joseph Adkins (died 1869) was a minister and state senator in Georgia during the Reconstruction Era after the American Civil War. He was a Republican who represented Warren County, Georgia. He supported civil rights for African Americans and reported racially motivated violence by the Ku Klux Klan. He was murdered in May 1869, after having led a delegation to Washington, D.C. to obtain military protection against widespread acts of violence by the Klan.
Background.
The Ku Klux Klan became violent in Georgia on or before March 30, 1868, when 30 members of the Klan killed white politician George Ashburn after he spoke at a public rally that day. The Klan spread across Georgia and by the fall 260 cases were filed of violence inflicted on blacks, but the court cases were denied by black people against whites. There were also instances where the Klan attacked Georgian Republicans, regardless of the color of their skin. In October 1868, there was a report of 32 assassinations and 212 assaults to the Committee on Murder and Outrages at a convention held in Macon, Georgia.
Critics of Adkins considered him a scalawag, someone disloyal to the Confederacy. He supported civil rights for blacks. He also supported posted a statutory bond for someone hated by the Klan and conservatives, Sheriff John Norris in April 1868. He also reported racist crimes and the name of a suspect, Ellis Adams, who was a member of the Klan. Violence continued into 1869, and he led a delegation to Washington, D.C. to request military support in Georgia for safety of its citizens.
Murder.
Although he was warned that White supremacists were targeting him and that he was in danger, Adkins travelled from Washington, D.C. to his home to see his family and attend to personal affairs. Adkins was assassinated by members of the Ku Klux Klan on his way home from the train station at Dearing, Georgia on May 10, 1869. Before he died, he was able to name one of the gang who shot him, Ellis Adams.
His wife, Sallie Adkins (identified as Sarah Adkins in some official documents), submitted a petition to the United States Congress about the events.
Aftermath.
There were unsubstantiated rumors questioning Adkins' honor and fidelity. Adams died in December 1869, not having been charged for the murder of Adkins. Violence by the Klan and other violent persons continued through much of 1871, the year of the Ku Klux Klan Act.
Stephen Ward Angell reported that Ayer and Adkins had been "brutally slaughtered because they dared to be Republicans, and possessed such an amount of integrity that they defied both bribes and threats."

Waldrada of Lotharingia

Waldrada was the mistress, and later the wife, of Lothair II of Lotharingia.
Biography.
Waldrada's family origin is uncertain. A prolific 19th-century French writer Baron Ernouf suggested that Waldrada was of noble Gallo-Roman family, sister of Thietgaud, the bishop of Trier, and niece of Ghunter, the archbishop of Cologne. However, these suggestions are not supported by any evidence, and more recent studies have instead suggested she was of relatively undistinguished social origins, though still from an aristocratic milieu.
The "Vita Sancti Deicoli" states that Waldrada was related to Eberhard II, Count of Nordgau (included Strasbourg) family of Etichonids, though this is a late 10th-century source and so may not be entirely reliable on this question.
In 855 the Carolingian king Lothar II married Teutberga, a Carolingian aristocrat and the daughter of Bosonid Boso the Elder. The marriage was arranged by Lothar's father Lothar I for political reasons. It is very probable that Waldrada was already Lothar II's mistress at this time.
Teutberga was allegedly not capable of bearing children and Lothar's reign was chiefly occupied by his efforts to obtain an annulment of their marriage, and his relations with his uncles Charles the Bald and Louis the German were influenced by his desire to obtain their support for this endeavour. Lothair, whose desire for annulment was arguably prompted by his affection for Waldrada, put away Teutberga. However, Hucbert took up arms on his sister's behalf, and after she had submitted successfully to the ordeal of water, Lothair was compelled to restore her in 858. Still pursuing his purpose, he won the support of his brother, Emperor Louis II, by a cession of lands and obtained the consent of the local clergy to the annulment and to his marriage with Waldrada, which took place in 862. However, Pope Nicholas was suspicious of this and sent legates to investigate at the Council of Metz in 863. The Council found in favour of Lothair's divorce, which led to rumours that the papal legates may have bribed and thus meant that Nicholas order Lothair to take Theutberga back or face excommunication. 
With the support of Charles the Bald and Louis the German, Teutberga appealed the annulment to Pope Nicholas I. Nicholas refused to recognize the annulment and excommunicated Waldrada in 866, forcing Lothair to abandon Waldrada in favour of Teutberga. Lothair accepted this begrudgingly for a time, but shortly afterward at the end of 867 Pope Nicholas I died. Thus, Lothair began to seek the permission of the newly appointed Pope Adrian II to again put Teutberga aside and marry Waldrada, riding to Rome to speak with him on the matter in 869. However, on this way home Lothair died. 
Children.
Waldrada and Lothair II had some sons and probably three daughters, all of whom were declared illegitimate:

Texas Senate Bill 4

Texas Senate Bill 4 (or Texas SB 4) is a bill that effectively bans sanctuary cities in the state of Texas. It was filed on November 15, 2016, and discussed during the regular session of the eighty-fifth Texas Legislature. Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill into law on May 7, 2017.
The law was the subject of several legal challenges, though it remains in effect.
Content.
Texas Senate Bill 4 makes it a Class A misdemeanor for local officials as well as public colleges and universities to refuse to work with the federal government on immigration enforcement. The bill also fines those in violation beginning at $1,000 and climbing up to $25,500 if the individual or entity continues to violate the law. Texas Senate Bill 4 also allows police officers to check the immigration status of those they detain if they choose.
Bill history.
Background.
In Texas, no city had formally declared "sanctuary" status, but a few did not fully cooperate with federal immigration authorities and drew a negative response from the legislature. Bills seeking to deprive state funding from police departments and municipalities that do not cooperate with federal authorities had been introduced into the Texas Legislature several times. On February 1, 2017, Texas Governor Greg Abbott blocked funding to Travis County, Texas due to its recently implemented "de facto" sanctuary city policy. The Travis County incident inspired the passage of Texas Senate Bill 4.
Legislative history.
Texas Senate Bill 4 was first introduced into the Texas Legislature on November 15, 2016. It passed the Texas Senate on February 8, 2017, by a vote of 20–10. The bill then went to the Texas House of Representatives, where it passed on April 27, 2017, by a vote of 94–53, with one representative voting "present." Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed the bill into law on May 7, 2017.
Legal challenges.
On August 30, 2017, Judge Orlando Luis Garcia of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas blocked certain sections of Senate Bill 4 from going into effect, including the part requiring local officials to honor federal detainers. The State of Texas appealed the ruling and on September 25, 2017, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that those provisions could temporarily go into effect as the court heard the arguments over the case. March 13, 2018, the Fifth Circuit again ruled that most of the law, except for a portion punishing officials who "endorse" sanctuary city policies, could go into effect while the case was pending.

William Noyes Farmstead

The William Noyes Farmstead is a historic farm property at 340 Gallup Hill Road in Ledyard, Connecticut. Dating to about 1735, it is a well-preserved example of a rural farmstead. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992.
Description and history.
The William Noyes Farmstead is located in southeastern Ledyard, its buildings set on either side of Gallup Hill Road west of its junction with Shewville Road. The house and a small barn are on the south side, while a larger barn is set close to the road on the north side. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It is oriented with its main facade to the south, away from the road, and is separated from the road by a fence. The front is five bays wide, with the entrance slight off center, framed by Federal period pilasters, transom window, and entablature. Both barns are set on rubblestone foundations, and are of post and beam framing. The larger one has been adapted for use as a studio.
The oldest portion of this house, probably its western half, was built about 1735 by William Noyes. The house was likely enlarged by James Woodbridge, who acquired the property from a member of the Noyes family in 1783, at which time it also received its Federal style. The house is unusual for its age in Ledyard, where most farm houses were 1-1/2 story Capes, and for its high state of preservation. The property remained in agricultural use into the early 1940s.

Magellan Rise (ocean plateau)

Magellan Rise is an oceanic plateau in the Pacific Ocean, which covers a surface area of . There is another "Magellan Rise" west from the Marshall Islands as well.
The Magellan Rise has been called a large igneous province by Coffin and Endholm 2001 and was emplaced 145 million or 135-128 million years ago, possibly as a consequence of intense volcanism at a former triple junction. Alternatively, the Rise was formed by a mantle plume linked to the deep "JASON superplume". Candidate mantle plumes are the Easter hotspot and the Foundation hotspot.
The volume of rocks in the Magellan Rise is about -. It apparently developed first on the Phoenix Plate before being transferred onto the Pacific Plate 125 million years ago. The Magellan Rise never rose to shallow depths at least since the Cretaceous, and the Rise is covered by sediments of Tithonian/Berriasian to Quaternary age.

The Debt (2003 film)

The Debt is a two-part British television crime drama film, written by Richard McBrien and directed by Jon Jones, that first broadcast on BBC One on 31 August 2003. The film stars Warren Clarke as Geoff Dresner, a retired safe-cracker determined to leave his criminal past behind, who is persuaded to come out of retirement to do one last job to clear the debt of his son-in-law, Terry (played by Martin Freeman), owed to a notorious loan-shark. However, things go badly wrong when a security guard dies as a result of their plan. Hugo Speer, Lee Williams, Orla Brady and Nina Sosanya are also credited as principal members of the cast.
Writer Richard McBrien said of the production; "The Debt is a story about a criminal, a detective and a lawyer and how their lives collide with each other. The idea is that all three men owe debts to their children in some way which affects the way they do their job." The first part drew 5.08 million viewers, while the second part drew 4.48 million. The film currently holds a 71% 'Fresh' rating on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Debt" was released on Region 1 DVD on 7 November 2006.
Plot.
Part 1.
Geoff Dresner (Warren Clarke), a retired safe-cracker, has turned his back on a life of crime in an attempt to turn an honest living as a baker. But his past comes back to haunt him when he's forced to take on one last job in order to help his less than useful son-in-law Terry (Martin Freeman), who has failed to pay his debt to a cutthroat loan shark, and must immediately cough up an enormous sum of money if he has any hope of emerging unscathed. Dresner organises a robbery in an attempt to help Terry, but the plan immediately goes wrong. Dresner finds himself caught in the sights of DS Edward Foster (Hugo Speer), who is struggling financially, and is eager to finally bringing him to justice after years of evading the law; and James Hilden (Lee Williams), a hotshot rookie lawyer who has recently married and has a baby on the way.
Part 2.
Dresner finds himself caught up in a tangled web of lies, secrets and double-crossing, as he tries to find a way to save himself and his family. Not quite ready for his loss of independence, Hilden embarks on an affair with an ex-colleague, and agrees to take on Geoff's case, but unwittingly, his secret love life becomes caught up in his professional affairs, and before he knows it, he is stuck in a vicious circle of deceit and denial. Geoff soon realises that Hilden is unequipped with the experience or know-how to successfully defend him. Foster's second job as a night taxi driver continues to take its toll on his police work, and as a result, he is overlooked for promotion – but he soon realises that the Dresner investigation could be an opportunity for him to make the grade.

Marc Elrich

Marc Elrich (born November 2, 1949) is an American politician and County Executive of Montgomery County, Maryland. He was formerly an at-large member of the Montgomery County Council, first elected in 2006. Prior to that he served on the Takoma Park City Council for 19 years, representing Ward 5 which covers and incorporates the greater Long Branch / East Silver Spring area.
He became the Democratic nominee for Montgomery County Executive in the 2018 primary before winning the general election against the Republican nominee Robin Ficker and independent candidate Nancy Floreen.
Early life and education.
Marc Elrich was born in Washington, D.C., near Takoma Park. His father was a postal worker and his mother was a waitress.
When he was ten his family moved to Silver Spring. In 1963, when he was 14, he went to hear Martin Luther King Jr. speak at the March on Washington. He attended Albert Einstein High School in Kensington and the University of Maryland for college. He was once arrested at an anti-apartheid rally. An early job after graduating college was as a manager in the automotive department at Montgomery Ward where one of his responsibilities was helping to open new stores. He returned to school, getting a master's degree in teaching from Johns Hopkins University.
Career.
Education.
Elrich taught 4th and 5th grade for 17 years at Rolling Terrace Elementary. He stated that his teaching showed him firsthand how poverty, poor living conditions and unaffordable housing can impact a child's ability to learn. He stated that seeing low income students come to school without breakfast and never having been to a doctor are some of the things that drive his public service.
County Council member-at-large.
Elrich ran for the county council four times before getting elected in 2006. Since that time, he has served three terms. He was elected with the most votes of any candidate in 2010 and 2014.
"The Washington Post" endorsed his candidacy in 2010 and 2014, stating that he was viewed as somewhat anti-business, but advocated a business-beneficial transit system and had a strong focus on efficiency and the development and planning process.
He worked to have environmental concerns addressed in the Clarksburg Master Plan and he spearheaded the effort to protect Tenmile Creek. The amendment that was passed requires development to supply environmental protections. He considered protecting the stream one of his highest environmental concerns at the time. He supported one bill protecting the tree canopy and sponsored another protecting street trees. Both were voted into law. He advocated for the elimination of cosmetic use of pesticides on private lawns because of their cancer-causing chemicals helping the county become the first locality in the country to do so and was considered a key co-sponsor of the legislation. He advocated against the use of artificial playing turfs that contain lead and other cancer-causing ingredients and sponsored a resolution banning crumb rubber turfs. He voted for the Montgomery county five-cent bag tax to fund environmental cleanup efforts. He was lead sponsor of a bill to require large gas stations to be at least 500 feet from schools and parks.
In 2013, Elrich was the lead sponsor of legislation to increase the county's minimum wage, which raised it to $11.50 per hour. Elrich twice was the lead sponsor of legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour in Montgomery County. In January 2017, a bill passed in the Council and was vetoed by then County Executive Ike Legget. In November 2017, a second bill passed and was signed into law, making Montgomery County the first county in Maryland with a $15 per hour minimum wage. At the time of the bill's passage, the State of Maryland's minimum wage was $9.25 per hour.
Elrich voted against the White Flint Mall II sector plan because Elrich stated that the plan would have created 6,000 residential units located too far from a Metro station. He voted against the Bethesda Master Plan because it failed to consider the effect the increased density would have on roads and schools. He voted against the Lyttonsville Sector Plan because he stated that it would increase housing costs and force residents to move out, as well as the Chevy Chase Lake Sector Plan. He opposed a proposal to sell land adjacent to the White Oak Food and Drug Administration campus because local roads and infrastructure were not equipped to handle additional traffic and students. In 1995, he joined with community members and fought against a proposed mega mall in downtown Silver Spring.
County executive.
In 2017, Elrich declared his candidacy for county executive. He participated in public financing. The largest allowed contribution is $150. He did not accept money from developers or land use attorneys.
He received criticism when he described the council's plan to rezone neighborhoods around the proposed 16-mile Purple Line light rail train as "ethnic cleansing". He said he was sorry if his language was offensive, but he defended his comment saying that this is not just a Montgomery County problem but a nationwide problem and a "well-known fact" of what happens when rail lines take over communities.
Elrich supports policies such as $15 minimum wage and affordable housing that stabilize and support low-income families.
On July 22, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich signed an executive order prohibiting county officials from asking residents about their immigration status or cooperating with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In November 2019, Elrich banned Montgomery County police stations from displaying thin blue line flags. Acknowledging that the flag was a symbol of "support" to some and a symbol of "divisiveness" to others, he drew criticism from Governor Larry Hogan for the policy.
Personal life.
Elrich has four children. Two were foster children, including a son who has Down syndrome. He has lived in Takoma Park for most of his life. He is Jewish.
2018 elections.
Primary election results.
Primary election was held on June 26, 2018.

Joseph Henry Lonas

Joseph Henry Lonas (January 4, 1925 – August 3, 2011) was an American sculptor and painter who spent most of his artistic career in Berlin, Germany.
Life and Work.
Joseph Henry Lonas was born in Manassas, Virginia in 1925 and began his artistic education at the age of 14 at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. Immediately after graduating high school in 1943, Lonas joined the Army and was assigned as a gunner to the 987th Field Artillery Battalion, with which he served in Normandy, the Ardennes, Rhineland, and Central Europe.
After World War II, Lonas earned his Bachelor of Arts from the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia where he studied under renowned sculptor Professor Carl Roseberg. Roseberg recalls Lonas as one of his most talented students and that he had "a natural talent and inclination." Though Lonas had planned to pursue a graduate degree at the University of Iowa, his studies were interrupted by a call to serve in the Korean War. After completing his service, Lonas returned to the University of Iowa and graduated with a master's degree in Art History in 1953. Upon his graduation at the University of Iowa, Lonas was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship to study at the University of Fine Arts in Berlin, Germany, where he later became a professor.
Lonas spent the majority of his artistic career in Berlin. At one time he worked at the prestigious art foundry Bildgießerei Hermann Noack in the city. By 1976, Lonas had installed seven outdoor sculptures in Berlin, the largest number by any artist in the city. Large scale public art sculptures by Lonas can still be found in Berlin.
His works were also included in many one-person shows in Berlin, the Hague, Williamsburg, and Backnang from the 1960s through the first decade of the 21st century. For instance, in 2004, Lonas' work was displayed in a solo show at the Soltaire Galerie in Berlin, Germany. From September 15 – October 29, 2004, an exhibition of Lonas' work titled "Sculpture &amp; Innovation" debuted at The Center for the Arts of Greater Manassas and Prince William County.
Smaller-scale sculptures, paintings, and drawings by Lonas are part of the permanent collection of the Muscarelle Museum of Art at the artist's alma mater, the College of William &amp; Mary in Williamsburg, VA. The collection, given by Lonas in 1975, includes working models of outdoor pieces in bronze, photographs, and drawings.
Lonas experimented with innovative ways to make his sculptures changeable by audiences, ultimately developing a lock and plug mechanism he referred to as a mechanical joint consisting of brass cubes with twist locks into which spreader pins could be inserted. Art critic notes that Lonas was "concerned actually with the sculptural problem, with the synthesis of spatial description and volume, combining various sculptural ideas. He solves this problem as no one else does with the most modern aids that his time can offer him and over which, in an exemplary way and in every sense of the word, he has total command."
Lonas' work is the subject of the book "Synthese und Neuerung : Skulpturen, Zeichnungen von Joseph Henry Lonas," authored by John Gabriel. Gabriel comments that "Lonas's work reflects independence of mind and a spirit of individualism. He has made a notable contribution to contemporary sculpture."

Fredrik Bagge

Fredrik Bagge (1646-1713) was a Swedish Lutheran vicar in the Church of Sweden in Marstrand, Bohuslän.
Fredrik Bagge was born in Marstrand 24 December 1646 to the Mayor Nils Bagge, and Malin Burgesdotter. After studies at the University of Copenhagen and the University of Uppsala, among other foreign universities, he was promoted to Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Wittenberg in 1667. Two years later he was appointed vicar in Marstrand.
Bagges was acknowledged not only as a learned man, but also for his unshakeable loyalty to his fatherland.
After the Danish-Norwegian victory against the Swedes in the Battle of Marstrand 1677, Fredrik Bagge was ordered to celebrate Te Deum and proclaim prayers to the King Christian V of Denmark and his armed forces. Instead, in the presence of the Danish Commander-in-chief and officers of the Danish invasion forces, he gave prayers to King Charles XI of Sweden and for his victory against Denmark–Norway. As a result, he was imprisoned in Carlsten by court-martial and sentenced to death. At the trial, he initiated a powerful speech in support of the Swedish crown, when a Danish officer ran up to him and put a hand on the vicar's mouth, insisting to General Ulrik Frederik Gyldenløve to "not let him speak, or else he will make ridicule of us all". He relocated to Fredriksten awaiting the outcome.
Yet, as a wealthy man, he avoided the death sentence only by paying three-double man prices.
Upon return of the Swedes to Marstrand, King Charles XI of Sweden bestowed him lavish praise, distinguishing him amonger things with the appointment to Rural Dean with annexes.

Paccia Marciana

Paccia Marciana was the first wife of Septimius Severus, who later became Roman emperor. They married around 175 and she died of natural causes around 186.
Name and marriage.
Her name shows her links to two Roman gentes, the Paccia and the Marcia - the latter also included Ulpia Marciana, elder sister of the emperor Trajan. She originated in Leptis Magna and was of Punic or Libyan origin, but virtually nothing else is known of her. Severus probably met her during his tenure as legate under his uncle - he does not mention her in his autobiography, though he later commemorated her with statues when he became Emperor.
Disputed issue.
The "Historia Augusta" claims that Marciana and Severus had two daughters but their existence is nowhere else attested. It appears that the marriage produced no surviving children, despite lasting for more than ten years. Aurelius Victor, Eutropius and the unknown author of "Epitome de Caesaribus" state that she and not Severus' second wife Julia Domna was the mother of Caracalla, though this is now disregarded and thought to be linked to their claims that Julia married Caracalla. Julia Domna is widely accepted to be the mother of both Caracalla and his younger brother Geta.

Archibald T. Kidd

Archibald Thomas Kidd (15 April 1873 – 15 June 1972) was a long-standing British trade union leader.
Born in Liverpool, Kidd was educated at Brunswick Wesleyan School. He completed an apprenticeship as a sheet metal worker with Bennett Brothers and Butler &amp; Forester's. In his spare time, he took evening classes to further his education. This enabled him to enter the Liverpool School of Technology, where he studied metal plate working, taking first class honours and the Bronze Medal of the City and Guilds. Following this, he studied at the University of Liverpool on a scholarship, and also with Ruskin College and the American School of Correspondence.
In 1893, Kidd joined the Liverpool Society of Tin Plate Workers, and was elected to its committee one year later, as soon as he became eligible. The society was affiliated to the General Union of Braziers and Sheet Metal Workers, and in 1906, Kidd was elected as its assistant secretary, succeeding as its general secretary in 1913. In 1920, he took a leading role in a merger which formed the National Union of Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers, with Kidd initially serving as secretary of its number 2 district. He became the union's assistant general secretary in 1923, also serving on the Executive Committee of the Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades (FEST). Concerned that the FEST did not provide for effective action, he successfully proposed that it was transformed into the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions. In addition, he served on the executive of the National Council of Labour Colleges, and taught social history to workers in his spare time.
Kidd was also active in the Labour Party, and was a leading figure in the party in Clapham.
Kidd finally succeeded as the union's general secretary in 1941, but he retired two years later. In retirement, he wrote "The History of the Tin Plate Workers, Sheet Metal Workers and Braziers Societies". He lived to the age of 99.

In March 2018, an instructor at the Islamic Studies class at Ripple Road Mosque's "Essex Islamic Academy" in Barking, London, Umar Haque, was convicted of trying to recruit an "army of children" to launch a series of ISIS-inspired attacks on dozens of targets across London. Also convicted were Abuthaher Mamun, who was accused of research and finance help to Haque; and Haque's confidant, Muhammad Abid, who failed to alert the police.
The plan was to launch simultaneous terror attacks against a handwritten list of 30 potential targets, including Big Ben, the London Underground, Westfield shopping centre, Heathrow Airport, courts, Shia Muslims, journalists and far-right groups.
The Charity Commission, has suspended supplementary educational classes with children at Ripple Road Mosque whilst it carries out its investigation, saying: "As part of the inquiry into the Essex Islamic Academy, the Commission will consider how Mr Haque was able to attempt to radicalise children, and what the trustees and others at the charity knew about this. The regulator will examine the level of supervision, due diligence and oversight the charity had over Mr Haque, and its adherence to safeguarding policies and procedures."

After 1806, the territories of Palpa were kept under the military governorship of him and Bada Amar Singh Thapa. In 1806, he was deputed to Kangra Fort along with Rudra Vir Shah as senior military officers after the death of Kaji Nain Singh Thapa in the conquest. He was one of the senior Bharadars to have opposed the Anglo-Nepalese War due to prevalence of weak administration in the western front suggesting a possible revolt from the citizens of the newly conquered west.

He left for Peking in 1822 leading the seventh Quinquennial mission to China.
Immediately after the incarceration of the Thapas in 1837, a new government with joint "Mukhtiyars" was formed with Ranganath Paudel as the head of civil administration, and Dalbhanjan Pande and Rana Jang Pande as joint heads of military administration. The ministry formed after the death of Mathabarsingh Thapa included him along with Chautariya Fateh Jung Shah, Gagan Singh Bhandari and Abhiman Singh Rana Magar.

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea campaigns (1943)

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea in World War II during 1943 involved engagements between submarines of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet attacking Axis merchantmen defended by Romanian and German naval warships, as well as and German U-boats attacking Soviet merchants on the eastern Black Sea. These engagements were a part of the Black Sea campaigns between Axis and Soviet naval forces.
Background.
As during the first 1941 campaign and the following year campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea. Once again, Axis defenses primarily consisted of Romanian-laid fields of mines. At the beginning of the year the Soviet navy had 18 operable submarines (and 11 on refit), and organized them into "wolf packs" of groups of 3 with an attempted coordination with aircraft (though reports were often late). At first Soviet results were reduced due to effective German interception and the shallow drafts of many targets, however better results were scored after the summer with introduction of new torpedo fuses.
German U-boats of the 30th U-boat Flotilla operated on the eastern site of the Black Sea, attacking Soviet targets.
Outcome.
Soviet submarines have been estimated to have sunk 20 targets (34,000 GRT) while suffering less losses: a better result compared to the campaigns of 1941 and 1942. This improvement forced the Germans to create a proper anti-submarine warfare unit: the 1. Unterseebootsjagdflottille, operating since June 1943 with 18 converted trawlers supported by BV-138 flying boats.

Castroville Historic District

Castroville Historic District is a United States historic district in Castroville, Texas. It includes the oldest parts of the city of Castroville and contains twelve designated contributing properties, including a Texas State Historic Site and numerous Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.
History and significance.
Castroville was established in 1844 by Henri Castro, an empresario of the Republic of Texas, who brought several dozen European families from the Upper Rhine valley regions of Alsace and Baden to populate his land grant along the Medina River, some west of San Antonio. Long after its foundation the city retained a strongly Alsatian character, both in the continued common use of the Alsatian language into the mid-twentieth century, and in the Alsatian architecture that characterizes the community to the present day.
The oldest portion of the city, surrounded on three sides by a bend in the Medina River, was designated a United States historic district on the National Register of Historic Places on April 3, 1970, in recognition of the old town's well-preserved colonial Alsatian architecture and unusual cultural heritage, for which it is known as the "little Alsace" of Texas. Castroville's was one of the first three United States historic districts to be designated in Texas.
The NRHP nomination specified twelve contributing properties within the district, including the Landmark Inn State Historic Site (an NRHP-listed site in its own right), St. Louis Catholic Church, and a number of private residences exemplifying the prevailing architectural style. Including some of these twelve properties, the district contains numerous Recorded Texas Historic Landmarks, many of them especially well-preserved residences of early colonists.
Architectural character.
The structures surveyed during the designation of the historic district, constructed between 1844 and the 1880s, share common architectural elements that mark the old town's Alsatian character. The oldest houses typically contain two rooms and a loft, with thick, stuccoed limestone walls, beams of cypress or cedar wood, and sloping, gabled roofs of tin or cypress wood shingles. A kitchen is typically either attached as a rear shed or built into a nearby free-standing structure. The houses are generally set close to the fronts of their lots, and many have full-width front porches.

Joseph Salter (missionary)

Joseph Salter (9 April 1822 – 3 March 1899) was a Christian missionary in London who worked with migrants to the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century. He was particularly known for his work with lascars and later for his work with ayahs. He taught himself several Indian languages and wrote two books describing his work.
Early life and family.
Joseph Salter was born at St Luke's, London, England, on 9 April 1822 to Matthew and Harriett Salter. He married Eliza Elizabeth Boid in 1853 who was born in Shoreditch, London. At the time of the 1861 census, the couple were living at Conant Place, Stepney, but had no children. At the time of the 1881 and 1891 censuses the family were living at East India Dock Road, not far from the Strangers' Home in West India Dock Road where Salter worked. They had children Elizabeth, Agnes, Joseph, Emily, and Alice.
Missionary activity.
Salter was the missionary at the Strangers' Home for Asiatics, Africans and South Sea Islanders (opened 1857), Limehouse, on behalf of London City Mission where he gained experience of working with lascars and taught himself several Indian languages. The home was established to deal with the problem of stranded lascars in London who by law were unable to obtain employment to return to their home countries.
In 1867, Salter found small groups of stranded Asians all over Britain. He worried about the effect of the "heathen mind" being exposed to European sin as well as the sin of its homeland and attempted to convert those he met to Christianity but his efforts were generally received only with polite indifference.
In December 1886, the Home had declared its intention to evict five Punjabi performers and their bear. They had initially arrived in England in the hope of making an income at fairs. However, their plans had not worked out and they soon found that they could not pay their rent. Salter described them as in a "perilous" situation and after confirming the sale of the bear to the Zoological gardens, appealed to the India Office for help but received a clear refusal of responsibility.
Salter was later associated with the Ayahs' Home in Hackney. Once, returning after helping an ayah board her ship to return home, he fell in the water and almost drowned.
Writing.
Salter wrote two books about his experiences. In the first, which he dedicated to Maharaja Duleep Singh, "The Asiatic in England: Sketches of Sixteen Years' Works Among Orientals" (1873), he described the tortures received by lascars on sea voyages, and his disbelief that anyone could think that "the coloured part of mankind existed only to be used like brute beasts, and to have the most insulting names language can supply heaped upon them". His second, "The East in the West; or, Work among the Asiatics and Africans in London" was published by Partridge in 1895.
Death and legacy.
Salter died on 3 March 1899. His residence at the time of his death was 377 East India Dock Road. Probate was granted in London to Emily Marion Gilley and her husband Samuel Gilley, inspector to a friendly society, in the amount of £1,853.

Clomantagh Castle

Clomantagh Castle is a 15th-century tower house located near Freshford, County Kilkenny, in Ireland. Originally constructed in the 1430s, additional buildings and outbuildings were added in the subsequent centuries - including a connected 19th century farmhouse. Carvings on the castle's walls include a Sheela na gig relief (a symbolic pagan nude).
Situated on lands owned by the Earls of Ormond, on the death of Pierce 'Ruadh' Butler, 8th Earl of Ormond in 1539, the castle was inherited by his son, Richard Butler, 1st Viscount Mountgarret. It remained in the hands of the Butlers of Mountgarret through the 16th and 17th centuries, until its confiscation following the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland.
The castle was subject to renovations in the late 20th century (which received an award from the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland), and is now managed as a holiday rental property by the Irish Landmark Trust.

Fathimath Azifa

Fathimath Azifa (born 28 October 1988) is a Maldivian film actress. She has established a career in Maldivian films and is the recipient of several awards, including a Gaumee Film Award.
Career.
2010–16: Debut and breakthrough.
Azifa made her career debut while studying at grade four, in an episode from Yoosuf Rafeeu's comedy television series "Dhiriulhumakee Mieebaa". Afterwards, she appeared in another episode of the same series aired in 2007. After a break of two years, she appeared in Ali Shifau's suspense thriller "Happy Birthday" (2009) which narrates the story of a simple man who receives a call on his birthday informing that his wife and son have been kidnapped, only to be returned for a ransom. Azifa played the role of Fazla, a colleague of a straightforward man who had an unfortunate birthday. A total of five shows with little occupancy were screened at the cinema, declaring the film a commercial failure, despite the positive response from the critics. Winning five Gaumee Film Awards and twelve Maldives Film Awards, the film was also screened at the Venice Film Festival. Afterwards, she appeared as model in a special appearance in Niuma Mohamed's directorial debut drama film "Niuma" (2010). She was next signed on by Amjad Ibrahim to play a devious maid in his family drama "Hithey Dheymee" (2011) alongside Amira Ismail and Hussain Solah which failed to do well commercially and critically.
In 2011 Azifa played the role of Areeka, an introverted prudent girlfriend living a modest lifestyle, in the Moomin Fuad-directed crime tragedy drama "Loodhifa". Featuring an ensemble cast, the film deals with current social issues in the society told from different perspectives of the characters. Made on a budget of MVR 600,000, the film was declared a commercial failure though it received wide critical acclaim. Her portrayal garnered her several awards, including a Gaumee Film Award for Best Supporting Actress and a nomination for the Best Actress at the 2nd Maldives Film Awards ceremony. Azifa next starred alongside Niuma Mohamed and Ismail Rasheed in Hussain Munawwar's romantic drama "Sazaa". Story of the film revolves around a carefree girl whose life flips upside down once she is forced to marry a brutal man. She played the role of an independent woman who commits suicide when she is brutally raped by her brother-in-law. Ahmed Nadheem reviewing from "Haveeru" wrote: Azifa leaves a strong impact. She seems polishing her acting skills with each movies". Though her performance received positive comments, reviewers were displeased with her the character when a "well-developed strong character ended up so badly". Critically well-received, the film emerged as a commercial success. It was followed by Hamid Ali's romantic family drama "Laelaa" opposite Yoosuf Shafeeu which was a critical and box office failure.
In 2014, Azifa starred opposite Yoosuf Shafeeu in the suspense thriller film "24 Gadi Iru" (2014) which was co-directed by Shafeeu and Mohamed Rasheed. The film focuses on a romantic relationship between a girl diagnosed with mental illness and her psychiatrist. Production of the film began in 2010, though it was theatrically released four years later. Her role as Reesha, a psycho girl and the film received mixed reviews from critics. Ahmed Nadheem reviewing from "Haveeru" wrote: "Indeed, Azifa is a very promising actress and she has proved her worth in the industry with "Loodhifa". However an actor needs a good mentor to extract the best in oneself. It is very clear the directors haven't tried a bit to bring out the raw talent inside of her". She next starred in Abdul Faththaah's romantic drama "Aadheys", alongside Niuma Mohamed, Hussain Sobah, Amira Ismail, Moosa Zakariyya and Ali Azim. Filming was completed in 2011, though it was released three years following the death of film producer Hassain Ali. It revolves around a sacrificing mother and her affection towards her child. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and failed to leave an impression commercially. Ismail Naail reviewing from Vaguthu wrote: "In contrast to her performance in "Loodhifa", this can be termed as disappointing". At the 8th Gaumee Film Awards she received her second Best Supporting Actress nomination for her role in the film.
Mohamed Aboobakuru-directed "Randhari" was Azifa's only release of 2015. Her portrayal of the character Aisha, along with the film, received negative reviews from critics and performed below average at the box office. The following year, she made a special appearance in the Yoosuf Shafeeu-directed "Baiveriyaa" (2016), a comedy film featuring an ensemble cast. The film emerged as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of the year.
2017–present: Commercial success.
Azifa's first release of 2017 came in the Ali Musthafa-directed family drama "Malikaa". Featuring Nuzuhath Shuaib and Mohamed Jumayyil in the lead role, the film tells the story of the sidelined daughter, played by Shuaib, who manages the family. Azifa played the role of Jeeza, the envious and insecure sister-in-law of the title character, showing an excessive interest in acquiring money and wealth. Ahmed Nadheem, revieweing for "Avas" opined that Azifa was the only star who "left an impression in the acting department" from the film, though he felt the "flaws in her character development led to lack of exhilaration" at her presence. Despite low expectations from trade analysts, the film received mixed reviews and performed moderately at the box office. She next featured alongside an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Saeed and Ali Seezan in the romantic comedy film "Naughty 40" which was directed by Shafeeu. The film revolves around three friends, Ashwanee, Ahsan and Ajwad (Played by Shafeeu, Saeed and Manik respectively) who are single and having a youthful outlook, in spite of being in their forties. Azifa played the role of Taniya, the beguiling lady signed up by her aunt to seduce and take down their rival businessman in the island, Jawad. The film met with both critical and commercial success, emerging as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of 2017.
She was next seen alongside Jadhulla Ismail in the Mohamed Aboobakuru-directed "Neydhen Vakivaakah", which was a critical and commercial failure. In the film she played the role of Zeena, a woman who is having a tragic and unfortunate love life where she is forced to separate from her lovers after dreadful events. Her fourth and final release of the year was Aishath Rishmy's romantic drama "Bos". Penned and produced by Fathimath Nahula, the film tells the story of Ibaa (played by Mariyam Azza), a woman from a royal family and her battle with depression after the demise of her father. Azifa played the role of June, a greedy woman going to extreme lengths for money, the love interest of Maish (played by Ibrahim Jihad) while duping other men in her trap. A reviewer from "Avas" criticise the film for having resemblance with American coming-of-age romantic drama "A Walk to Remember" (2002) and Indian romantic drama "Sanam Teri Kasam" (2016), however applauded Azifa's performance as the greedy and ungrateful woman. Though the film received mixed response from critics, it emerged as the highest grossing Maldivian film of 2017.
2018 was a dull year for Maldivian film-industry with regards to 2018 Maldivian presidential election, hence only one film of Azifa was released during the year; a suspense thriller film "Dhevansoora" (2018) written and directed by Yoosuf Shafeeu. The film marks Shafeeu's thirtieth direction and features an ensemble cast of twenty-one actors. Revolving around a murder investigation, she played an imaginary doctor counselling the character played by Shafeeu; a man suffering from dissociative identity disorder. The film received positive reviews from critics and was considered a "norm-breaker" for the Maldivian cinema. Ahmed Hameed Adam reviewing from VNews applauded Azifa's performance and found her to "sensuous yet convincing". The following year, she starred in Yoosuf Shafeeu's horror comedy film "40+" (2019), a sequel to 2017 released comedy film "Naughty 40", which was well received both critically and commercially.

In 2018, Azifa was ranked in the sixth position from "Dho?"'s list of Top Ten Actresses of Maldives where writer Aishath Maaha opined that Azifa is a "promising" actress who perfectly pulls off several characters, mostly supporting roles.

Ali Azim

Ali Azim is a Maldivian film actor.
Career.
2010–2016: Early releases.
Azim expressed his interest in acting at a very young age. Before he pursued a career in acting Azim worked as a dancer and stage performer. He was first recognized by the audience for his facial expressions while dancing. While working in the Animation Dance Group, the team made a short children's film "Lollypop" with "no serious intention but for entertainment". The film which features Azim in a "forgettable" role did not much help to accelerate his career. This was followed by Abdul Faththaah's 5 episodes drama series "Kaiveni", starred opposite Mariyam Zuhura. In 2013, Azim starred in a small role as a gang member in Hussain Munawwar's second direction, revenge thriller film "Dhilakani" (2013) along with Ismail Rasheed, Niuma Mohamed, Mohamed Manik, Mohamed Faisal and Aminath Rishfa. The film deals with a man's tumultuous journey to seek vengeance and the demolition of family bond over a girl. The film attracted negative reception from critics while Nadheem wrote: "Embraced with futile characters, impractical scenes and out-dated music, the film has problems in each department".
Azim made his official film debut in Abdul Faththaah's romantic drama "Aadheys" starring Niuma Mohamed, Hussain Sobah, Amira Ismail, Moosa Zakariyya and Fathimath Azifa in pivotal roles. Filming was completed in 2011, though it was released three years following the death of film producer Hassain Ali. It revolves around a sacrificing mother and her affection towards her child. Azim played the role of Fahud, only son of a wealthy family whose marriage has been disputed by his parents. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and failed to leave an impression commercially. Ismail Naail reviewing from Vaguthu wrote: "Azim as a newcomer shines in the established cast". At the 8th Gaumee Film Awards he received a nomination for Best Male Debut nomination for his role in the film.
Mohamed Aboobakuru-directed "Randhari" was Azim's first release of 2015. His portrayal of the character Shahid, along with the film, received negative reviews from critics and the film performed below average at the box office. He was then seen in the Ali Shifau-directed romantic film "Emme Fahu Vindha Jehendhen" alongside Mohamed Jumayyil and Mariyam Majudha. In a pre-premiere review from "Vaguthu", Ismail Nail noted Azim's "upgrade" in acting skills when compared to his previous works. The film was the highest grossing Maldivian film of the year, and was a commercial success.
2017–present: "Hahdhu", "Dhevansoora" and frequent collaborations.
Azim's first release of 2017 came in the Ali Musthafa-directed "Malikaa" which performed badly at the box office. He next featured alongside an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Saeed and Ali Seezan in the romantic comedy film "Naughty 40" which was directed by Shafeeu. The film met with both critical and commercial success, emerging as one of the highest grossing Maldivian films of 2017. He next appeared in Abdul Faththaah-directed film "Hahdhu". Though the film met with mixed reviews, Azim was particularly praised for his portrayal of the character, Hamza, a religious saint. Aishath Maaha of "Avas" wrote: "Perceived as a negative character, his acting skill during the emotional scenes, definitely proved that he is a wonderful actor". Azim regarded his performance in the film as a breakthrough performance in his career, which led him being offered several film projects afterwards. The film proved to be another successful venture for Azim, becoming the third highest grossing film of the year.
2018 was a dull year for Maldivian film-industry with regards to 2018 Maldivian presidential election, hence only one film of Faisal was released during the year; a suspense thriller film "Dhevansoora" (2018) written and directed by Yoosuf Shafeeu. The film marks Shafeeu's thirtieth direction and features an ensemble cast of twenty-one actors. Revolving around a murder investigating, Azim played a character suffering from dissociative identity disorder and the accused murderer. The film received positive reviews from critics and was considered a "norm-breaker" of the Maldivian cinema. Ahmed Hameed Adam reviewing from VNews considered Azim's performance as the "one of the best performances of the film"; "Seen as Shafeeu's imaginary self in his youth, each and every scene of Azim shine with his cinematic brilliance". Ismail Nail Rasheed from Raajje.mv wrote: "Azim's intense role as a mentally retarded man is the best performance Maldivian cinema has ever witnessed. He has dominated each scene that he was featured on irrespective of the experience as compared to other actors". He then starred in the first Maldivian web-series, a romantic drama by Fathimath Nahula, "Huvaa". The series consisting of sixty episodes and streamed through the digital platform Baiskoafu, centers around a happy and radiant family which breaks into despairing pieces after a tragic incident that led to an unaccountable loss. The series and his performance as the youngest sibling seeking vengeance for his deceased brother were positively received.
2019 was a successful year for Azim where he had multiple film releases. He first starred in Yoosuf Shafeeu's horror comedy film "40+" (2019), a sequel to 2017 released comedy film "Naughty 40", which was well received both critically and commercially. Later during the year, the first Maldivian anthology film was released which featured him a victim of verbal and sexual abuse in the segment directed by Abdul Faththaah, titled "Dharifiri ". The project was shot in 2013 and digitally released six years later due to several delays in post-production. Their next collaboration, "Nafrathuvumun" (2019) played alongside Shafeeu, Mariyam Azza and Ahmed Easa revolves around a guesthouse, the only source of income for a woman who is convinced by several men to sell the property. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" picked his performance as the best from the cast. This was followed by another direction from Shafeeu, the romantic horror film "Dhauvath" (2019), which follows a happily married couple who goes on a honeymoon trip and the paranormal activities they experience due to black-magic. Mariyam Waheedha from "Miadhu" considers his performance to be the "usual good" though it lacks the "seriousness" which his character Razeen shall possess.
Personal life.
On 6 October 2019, Azim married Hawwa Jeena.

Wildling (film)

Wildling is a 2018 American horror-fantasy film directed by Fritz Böhm and starring Liv Tyler, Bel Powley, Brad Dourif, Collin Kelly-Sordelet, and James LeGros. The screenplay was co-written by Böhm and Florian Eder. The plot follows Anna, a blossoming teenager who uncovers the dark secret behind her traumatic childhood. The film premiered at South by Southwest on March 10, 2018 and has received favorable reviews. It was released in the United States in select theaters and on video on demand on April 13, 2018, by IFC Films under their IFC Midnight brand.
Plot.
Anna spends her childhood confined in an attic bedroom by the man she believes is her father. He tells her that a child-eating monster called the Wildling roams the woods. When Anna reaches puberty, "Daddy" begins giving Anna daily injections of leuprorelin to prevent her body from maturing, explaining that he is treating her "illness." Anna suffers terrible side effects from the injections and asks "Daddy" to kill her. "Daddy" cannot bring himself to shoot her and instead turns the gun on himself.
Anna awakens in a hospital. "Daddy" has survived but is in intensive care. Anna accepts the offer of sheriff Ellen Cooper to temporarily stay at her home. She befriends Ellen's brother Ray and attends the local high school. Now free of leuprorelin, Anna enters puberty. She develops superhuman hearing and feels drawn to the forest and the Northern Lights. 
A DNA test reveals that "Daddy" is not Anna's biological father. Ray takes Anna to a party where they share a brief romantic moment. Anna's mouth suddenly begins bleeding. After rushing to the bathroom, she loses some teeth. Anna flees out the window. Outside, local bully Lawrence tries to rape her and she rips out his throat with her teeth. Confused and frightened, Anna realizes that sharper teeth are pushing out her human teeth and her nails are slowly becoming claw-like. 
In the woods, she encounters a one-eyed outdoorsman in a wolf pelt. He tells her that he has not seen one of her kind since the town conducted "the purge" sixteen years ago. He tells her she will find her mother in a nearby cavern. Anna discovers a fanged skull with a bullet hole in the forehead. Anna suddenly remembers "Daddy" shooting her mother. "Daddy", who was participating in the purge, could not bring himself to shoot the human-looking baby Anna and instead he hid her away.
Anna returns to Ellen's home, where Ellen handcuffs her, apologizing and explaining that the police have discovered Lawrence's body beside the dress Anna was wearing. Anna is jailed. That night, "Daddy" visits her and tells her that sparing her life was his greatest mistake, as it meant breaking his oath "to kill all the Wildlings." He hands her a syringe with a lethal dose of leuprorelin, urging her to take it. Anna refuses. The next morning when Ellen checks on her, Anna locks her in the cell and escapes. 
Ray drives Anna north into the forest. Abandoning the car, they go into the woods. That night, they have sex as Ray feels hair growing on Anna's back. The next morning, Anna finds claws on her feet with Ray compliments. They are ambushed by "Daddy" and a group of hunters. During their escape, Ray is shot in the arm. Knowing that Ray's life is in danger, Anna runs the other way, leading the hunting party away.
Three months later, Anna has transformed almost fully into a Wildling. Ellen follows the hunters on one of their expeditions into the forest where Anna kills several of them including Deputy Roger Fowler who held Ellen at gunpoint. Ellen allows Anna to escape after seeing that she is pregnant. The hunters set the forest on fire, driving Anna to dig underground. After Anna rips off her clothes where her feet are now stretched out, Anna is tranquilized by "Daddy" who attempts to perform a c-section on her to claim the unborn child. Anna fights off the drugs and kills "Daddy". Anna wakes up with the outdoorsman stitching her wounds.
The next morning Ellen and Ray see Anna from afar. They allow her to escape into the wilderness.
In the final scene, a fully transformed Anna has traveled far north as she cradles her newborn child under the Northern Lights. In the distance, she hears the call of another Wildling.
Production.
"Wildling" is the directorial feature debut of Fritz Böhm, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Florian Eder. The film was produced by Maven Pictures (US) in co-production with Arri Media (German), Film i Väst and Filmgate Films (both Swedish) and in association with IM Global and Night Fox Entertainment.
International sales were handled by IM Global, which first introduced the film to buyers at the European Film Market (EFM) during the 2016 Berlin International Film Festival. On February 18, 2016 Screen International announced that UK rights were acquired by Warner Bros. On February 19, 2016 Deadline Hollywood reported the closing of distribution deals for Latin America, South Africa, Switzerland, Portugal, Middle East, Turkey, Thailand, Israel, Ex-Yugoslavia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Baltic States and Vietnam. On February 7, 2018, "Variety" reported acquisition of the film's release rights in the United States by IFC Films.
Casting.
On October 5, 2015, "Deadline Hollywood" announced the casting of Bel Powley and Liv Tyler for the lead roles.
In an interview with "Film Inquiry", Bel Powley talked about what originally drew her to the film, saying, "I've always wanted projects that kind of subvert tradition and the norm, and I think that's something that Wildling really did from the first draft I read." With "Inverse", Powley described the film as a "story about becoming a woman in our society and the obstacles you're faced with." In an interview with "Vulture" she explained, "What Anna goes through in the movie is symbolic of what every girl goes through when they become a woman."
Brad Dourif said in an interview with "Rue Morgue", "When I was first offered the part [of Daddy] I wasn't initially going to do it. But before I actually said no, I wanted to talk to the director [Fritz Böhm] first. I told him about how, as a parent, I was interested in the idea of it, but that I wanted to play the character in a certain way. We worked through it, and after our discussion I wanted to be a part of the film. It was really the theme of fatherhood that compelled me to take it on."
Photography.
Production was first announced on October 5, 2015 and filming took place in late 2015 over 23 shooting days in various locations in the state of New York, including a natural stretch of the Bronx River within the Bronx Zoo, the town of Congers, the Sleepy Hollow police station, Rockland Lake State Park and Inwood Hill Park, Manhattan. In an interview with "Deadline Hollywood", Böhm spoke about the challenges of working with child actors, water scenes, animals and special effects makeup on a limited budget and schedule. During a Q&amp;A in the Arena Cinelounge Hollywood, Böhm revealed that the film's elaborate cave sequences were entirely shot in a warehouse in Brooklyn against blue screen, "since real caves don't exist within the 23 mile radius of Columbus Circle, Manhattan in which the movie had to be shot in order to fulfill the requirements for New York City's film incentive program."
Production designer Lauren Fitzsimmons told audiences at South by Southwest that the attic of "Daddy's house", which is seen in the first 15 minutes of the film, was a set she "built in the same Brooklyn warehouse in which the cave scenes were shot". In a Q&amp;A at the IFC Center (New York City) moderated by Boaz Yakin, Böhm explained that, during the editing process, he drove to the Redwood National Forest in Northern California to shoot additional nature footage by himself as a "one man second unit".
Post-production.
Böhm worked with Arri Media in Munich, Germany where the film was mixed in the Dolby Atmos format. The film was color-timed by Florian "Utsi" Martin, and film editor Peter Boyle served as creative consultant in the editing process. The film comprises roughly 350 visual effect shots, for which Böhm utilized his background as a post-production supervisor and visual effects artist in his native Germany.

Reception.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 70% based on 46 reviews, with an average rating of 6.1/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: ""Wildling"'s feminist themes – and the ferocious Bel Powley performance that brings them to life – are often enough to make up for its narrative deficiencies." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 58 out of 100, based on 10 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
"The Hollywood Reporter" included "Wildling" in their "10 Best Films of SXSW 2018". "The Hollywood Reporter"s Justin Lowe wrote in his review "Whether representing an unsettling allegory of adolescence or a fortuitous convergence of contemporary social issues, IFC Midnight's April release will provide a new perspective on themes of female empowerment before carving out a unique niche in home entertainment formats." "Entertainment Weekly" gave the film a B+ score with reviewer Leah Greenblatt calling the film "a clever, sharp-fanged mélange of classic midnight-movie horror and modern indie ingenuity." She wrote further, "As Bohm, assisted by vivid visuals from "Get Out" DP Toby Oliver, steers "Wildling" toward its gruesome, hallucinatory climax, the film loses something in logic but gains a visceral, almost volcanic momentum." "Los Angeles Times"s Noel Murray wrote "At its best, Wildling is very smart about how we humans like to compare ourselves to animals" and wrote the film "offers a darker, artier take on one of the classic horror premises: the misunderstood adolescent monster." Sara Stewart of "New York Post" called the film "skillfully directed" and pointed out Bel Powley's performance, "Powley uses her expressive face perfectly as the guileless Anna."
Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times called "Wildling" a "creature feature" that is "functional but lacks flavor." Kenigsberg noted that Powley "is well suited to her character’s wide-eyed wonderment" but found the movie suffers "when she turns into a special effect".
"/Film"s Meredith Borders called "Wildling" "such an assured debut, darkly mystical and elegant" and described the film as "a really smart approach to an ageless tale" with "great performances and some extremely effective gore." Jacob Knight of "Birth.Movies.Death" called the film "beautifully composed" and said that "Bel Powley is incredible as Anna". Vicki Woods of "Morbidly Beautiful" called the film "a powerful fable". She wrote in her review, "Wildling is a moodily atmospheric thriller combining supernatural scares with a myth-like tale of self-discovery and a beautiful coming-of-age tale" and "the acting throughout is terrific, but it is Bel Powley that takes the movie to another level." Heather Wixon of "Daily Dead" wrote, "Powley delivers a truly powerful portrayal". Charles Early wrote on "Austin360", "Director Fritz Bohm has created a misunderstood creature for the ages". Brian Williams of "The Hollywood Outsider" wrote, "The masterful direction of Wildling cannot be overstated. With only a two million dollar budget, Böhm pulls off a cinematic miracle that can only be compared to some of the independent upstart movies like "Desperado" and "Clerks" in that the budget-to-quality ratio is off the charts."
Alex Arabian of "Film Inquiry" called "Wildling" a "wildly original creature feature that transcends the horror genre" and the third act "visually rewarding". He wrote "Wildling is a film about growing up as an outsider, becoming a woman, being free from oppression, and loving your body as it is." He also pointed out the performances by the main cast, writing "Horror legend, iconic character actor, and Oscar nominee Brad Dourif, Liv Tyler, and rising star Bel Powley ("The Diary of a Teenage Girl") give a trio of superb performances. As the central and titular character, Powley delivers yet another powerhouse performance, following her "The Diary of a Teenage Girl" and "Carrie Pilby" roles." He also noted the work of cinematographer Toby Oliver, writing he did "a phenomenal job lighting and shooting the film". Paul D'Agostino of "Hyperallergic" called the film "captivating" and wrote "Fritz Böhm's debut film Wildling is cloaked in mystery, dark and dank, occasionally bloody, sometimes shocking, and fantastically folkloric." D'Agostino compared "Wildling" to Tomas Alfredson's Let The Right One In and a number of films by Guillermo del Toro and M. Night Shyamalan.
"Looper" called "Wildling" "one of the best movies of 2018".

Semantoridae is an extinct family of stem-pinnipeds with fossils found in France, Kazakhstan, and Canada, dating back to various points in time in the Miocene epoch. Based on their overall anatomy semantorids were not marine specialists, as their elongated bodies, a long tail and robust limbs suggest they were freshwater animals not unlike otters. Indeed, at least some taxa such as "Semantor" and "Potamotherium" were initially classified as mustelids closely related to otters.

<doc id="56948302" url="?curid=56948302" title="Mithqal Al Fayez">
Mithqal Al Fayez

Mithqal Sattam Fendi Al Fayez (Arabic: مثقال الفايز , ( – 1967) was a historical Jordanian political and tribal figure whose work helped the establishment of The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. Mithqal was one of the two leading sheikhs of Bani Sakhr, he took power in the early twentieth century, and headed the Al-Twaga half of the Bani Sakhr tribe, which consisted of the Al-Ghbein, Al-Amir, Al-Ka'abna, Al-Hgeish, Al-Saleet, and Al-Taybeen clans. He also headed his own clan, Al-Fayez.
Early life.
Mithqal Sattam Al-Fayez was born into the family of the leading shaykhs of the Bani Sakhr tribal confederacy around the year 1880. For two generations, his immediate family had led the confederacy, one of the largest and strongest nomadic tribal groups in the Syrian Desert. Mithqal's childhood was spent with the Kawakbeh family of the Ruwallah tribe, his mother's tribe, where he learned to ride and battle. He also adopted their accent and it stayed with him the rest of his life. Mithqal would only come back to the Bani Sakher around the year 1900, and the first written evidence of him was in 1906 when he was already a prominent Sheikh in the family at the age of 21.
Rise to power.
Mithqal quickly made a name for himself as a leader of raids. His success in battle has quickly earned him a reputation which helped to provide him with the springboard to the position of leadership.
Mithqal's elder brother, Fawwaz Al-Fayez, was the leader of the Bani Sakher before him, however a newspaper report from 1913 implies that the two shaykhs were acting as partners in the leadership of the Bani Sakhr under Ottoman patronage. By that time, they were generally known for their friendship with the government and faced internal opposition for that reason.
Upon Fawwaz's death in the summer of 1917, Mithqal made a bid on becoming the next Sheikh of the Clan, however, Mithqal lost to his seventeen-year-old nephew, Mashour, Fawwaz's son. The tribal council preferred the young Mashhur, who was a graduate of a school in Damascus, to the illiterate Mithqal, even though the latter was more mature and experienced. Mithqal did not agree with his younger cousin taking the position, in return, he was given the title of Pasha by the sultan, and was the only Arabian Sheikh to ever get this title from the Ottomans.
After Mashour's death four years later in a tribal conflict, Mithqal was an uncontested choice for the title.
Adventures in Arabia.
In 1925, William Seabrook sought to meet Mithqal after he heard about him from Emir Emin Arslan, where the Emir sent him to Ali Rikabi Pasha, Jordan's third prime minister, so that he would relay him to Emir Abdullah I, who would "surely know where Mithqal is", as they "called each other cousins and were friends for years". Emir Emin sent William with a letter in his name, which read
William would soon use this letter as he was stopped by bedouin thieves who ordered of him all his and his guide's belongings, and at the reading of the letter they choose to apologize and let them pass. 
William eventually reaches Mithqal's encampment, and writes his first impressions of him:
William would spend months with Mithqal and the Bani Sakher, ride in battles with them, and retell famous tribal stories such as "The Eyes of Gutne" and Haditha's benevolence in his book Adventures in Arabia (1927).
Relationships and Alliances.
Mithqal himself was born from a calculated strategic alliance between the Beni Sakher and the Ruwalla, and over the course of his lifetime he built strong mutually beneficial relations with other important figures in Arabia and abroad. Most Notably Sheikh Minwer Shtewi Al-Hadid of the Jordanian Al-Hadid Tribe.
King Abdullah I.
Then Emir Abdullah I had a personal, political, and business relationship with Mithqal. Their first meeting was in 1920, when Mithqal accepted Abdullah's invitation to a meeting in Ma'an, agreeing to ally himself and his tribe with Abdullah and inviting him to Amman. With the support of Mithqal and his father-in-law Mayor Saeed Pasha Khayr, Amman turned into the Hashemites focal point in Jordan. Mithqal was Abdullah's most important and powerful ally in Jordan, and in return Abdullah exempted Mithqal and his family from taxes and granted them the land that the Ottoman's confiscated to build the Hijaz railway and gifts such as the car he gave to Mithqal.
When in 1930, Mithqal's eldest son Sultan died of illness, Mithqal refused to leave his grave after the funeral; only to be persuaded by Emir Abdullah. In 1924, Mithqal and Emir Abdullah went together to Mecca to perform the Hajj. Mithqal would publicly support Abdullah in his attempt to unify the country, this helped cement the Emir's position in Jordan which was still governed tribally at the time. Mithqal's support of Emir Abdullah (and later kings) is also noted as one of the reasons of Jordan's relative stability and its sovereign integrity as King Faisal Al Saud have noted that "if it wasn't for Beni Sakher, our borders would reach Palestine".
Emir Abdullah would help lend Mithqal money to cultivate his land, and when the Emir's own funds were lacking, he and Mithqal would secure land deals and mortgage both of their lands to foreign bankers as the added size of both Mithqal's and the governments land helps leverage the deals to their favor.
King Faisal I of Iraq.
Mithqal maintained a friendly relationship with King Faisal I after 1919, he knew Faisal before he became King of Iraq and famously hosted him in Um Al-Amad in 1923, where Faisal stayed the night. Mithqal also attended the reception of Faisal in Alexandria, and the ceremony of the death of King Faisal's son Ghazi.
Role in Jordan's agriculture.
Mithqal inherited his father's, Sattam Al-Fayez, interest in agriculture, and further developed and cultivated the lands in Jordan for barely, wheat, lentils, olives, and other vegetables. Mithqal's role in Jordan's agriculture was crucial for the well-being of the country, as he was the first person to import a mechanical tractor and plough in the country's history. The effect of this purchase has helped the country out of a poverty-stricken famine in the mid-1930s as the production of wheat and barely has increased from 40,000 tons and 16,000 from 1936 to 113,000 tons and 53,000 tons in 1937; this effectively tripled the food supply of the land and helped in feeding its inhabitants. This increase in production has also tripled Jordan's food exports during those years, which opened the much needed revenue for the poverty stricken Transjordan of that time.
Ambush of the 1930s.
Mithqal was riding his mare in the desert accompanied by only one man. It was during the winter season, and the Bani Sakhr had migrated east towards Wadi Sirhan. Suddenly, Mithqal and his escort were surprised by an ambush set by members of an enemy tribe. A bullet grazed the side of Mithqal's head, almost killing him, and he was hit in the shoulder. Mithqal and his escort fired back and managed to drive off their attackers, but Mithqal was badly wounded. His escort tied a piece of cloth around his bleeding shoulder, pulled him over his mare, and rode on quickly to seek aid.
They arrived in the nearby camp of a Bani Sakhr tribesman and asked for his help in fetching a car to take Mithqal to a hospital. He sent one of his men by camel to the encampment of Shaykh Haditha Al-Khraisha, who in turn sent a messenger to Amman. A car finally arrived, but in the meantime, Mithqal was suffering from loss of blood and in great pain. Mithqal spent twenty days in an Amman hospital. He survived, but the damage was irreversible. For the rest of his life, he could hardly use that arm, which dangled nearly lifeless from his shoulder.
Imprisonment of Major General Fredrick Peake.
In 1919, over a decade long land dispute, Major General Fredrick Peake pursued a meeting with Mithqal to discuss the dispute. However, Mithqal choose to stay in his family's headquarters in Um Al Amad, which then prompted Peake to approach him unarmed to avoid a large conflict. Initially, Mithqal agreed to his request, however the day after Mithqal ordered the arrest of the Major General, which led to Peake to stay in the stables of the Al-Fayez for at least a day. It is unclear why Mithqal ordered the arrest of Peake, and although Peake rights unfavorably of Mithqal in an undermining manner in his books, he reportedly "bore no grudge" according to C.S. Jarvis's biography of the Peake.
Last years.
Mithqal's health soon began deteriorating soon after the death in 1962 of his favorite wife ‘Adul, which was a severe blow to Mithqal. In the last five years of his life, he suffered from progressively declining health. Though he was fortunate enough to receive superb medical treatment in Cairo, Beirut, and Europe, diabetes and other age-related illnesses brought about his death in his late eighties in April 1967.
Mithqal's Legacy.
The mourning period was over and the dignitaries and ordinary people left Mithqal’s house. The bereaved family was left to deal with the huge void created by Mithqal’s demise. It was undisputed that the elder son, Akef Al-Fayez, would become the head of the family and the main bearer of his father’s legacy.
One of the first things the family did was to gather to distribute Mithqal’s huge landholdings. By the time of his death, Mithqal had accumulated at the very least 120,000 dunams (30,000 acres) in Jordan, mostly around south Amman and northern Madaba. Several years later, the family sold a large portion of that land to the Jordanian government. Today, Queen Alia International Airport stands on what used to be Mithqal’s fields.
On May 25th, 2021, Mithqal was posthumously awarded the Medal of the State Centennial, on the Kingdom's on the 75th Independence, his grandson H.E Trad Al-Fayez received the award on his behalf. Mithqal's son, Akef Al-Fayez was also posthumously awarded the medal, received by his son H.E Faisal Al-Fayez.
Mithqal in Popular Culture.
Mithqal was a main character and the paramount character in the first half of William Seabrook's Adventures in Arabia when William sought to find Mithqal and experience the Arabian lifestyle in the late 1920s.
In early 2018, a TV Drama Series following Mithqal's life was announced to be in the works by the Al-Hijjawi production company.
On May 22, 2019, Al-Mamlaka broadcast a 50 minute documentary on their television channel that follows events from Mithqal's life. The documentary has also been uploaded to their Youtube channel

<doc id="56948426" url="?curid=56948426" title="Operations manual">
Operations manual

The operations manual is the documentation by which an organisation provides guidance for members and employees to perform their functions correctly and reasonably efficiently. It documents the approved standard procedures for performing operations safely to produce goods and provide services. Compliance with the operations manual will generally be considered as activity approved by the persons legally responsible for the organisation.
The operations manual is intended to remind employees of how to do their job. The manual is either a book or folder of printed documents containing the standard operating procedures, a description of the organisational hierarchy, contact details for key personnel and emergency procedures. It does not substitute for training, but should be sufficient to allow a trained and competent person to adapt to the organisation's specific procedures.
The operations manual helps the members of the organisation to reliably and efficiently carry out their tasks with consistent results. A good manual will reduce human error and inform everyone precisely what they need to do, who they are responsible to and who they are responsible for. It is a knowledge base for the organisation, and should be available for reference whenever needed. The operations manual is a document that should be periodically reviewed and updated whenever appropriate to ensure that it remains current.
Format.
The operations manual can be a digital or paper document. Digital format has advantages for revision control and can be distributed easily and at low cost. The detail should be sufficient to allow a competent person without specific experience to understand what is needed and how it is to be done. It is not a training manual, too much or too little detail can make it inefficient.
Contents.
Content will vary depending on the organisation, but some basic structure is fairly universal. 
Typical sections include: 
There are two basic categories of information: Information that is relevant to all people in the organisation, and often also to clients and the general public, and information that is relevant to specific positions.
There may be statutory or regulatory requirements for specific content. In some cases the CEO may be required to authorise the operations manual by signature, and this authorisation may be required to be present in the document. A version number and date of commencement may be required, and it may be a controlled document.
Organogram.
The organisational hierarchy is commonly and effectively described by an organisational chart, or organogram, a diagram that shows the structure of an organization and the relationships and relative ranks of its sections and members which gives the reader an easily understood picture of where key people fit into the organisation.
Job descriptions.
A job description is a document that describes the general tasks, duties, and responsibilities of a position, and may specify the functionary to whom the position reports, specifications such as the competence, qualifications, registration, certification or skills needed by the person in the job, and a salary range. Formal job descriptions help people understand their roles within the organisation and identify each other's responsibilities.
Contact details.
These include names and contact details for key persons within the organisation and important external contacts.
Emergency procedures.
Any emergency procedure that would be the standard response to a reasonably foreseeable emergency in the normal course of business would be detailed in the operations manual as a reference. There might also be specifications on how frequently exercises should be held. Some frequently encountered emergency procedures include:
Policies.
A policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol. Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization. Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making. Policies to assist in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e.g. work-life balance policy. In contrast policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e.g. password policy.
Annexures and references.
Manuals that already exist for equipment or procedures may be incorporated into an operations manual as annexures, or referenced if they are not of general utility, so they can be found when needed and checked for continued validity when the operations manual is revised.
Revision, updates and distribution.
If an operations manual is to be useful it must be distributed to the people who will use it, and they should have the current version. Distribution and updating policies and procedures are also commonly part of the content of the manual.
Specific requirements in industry.
Commercial diving.
In South Africa a diving contractor is obliged in terms of Regulation 21 of the Diving Regulations 2009 to provide an operations manual and make it available on site to the dive team before a diving operation may commence. This manual must contain prescribed types of information relating to health and safety, as specified in the codes of practice relating to the planned diving operations. The Code of Practice for Inshore Diving requires the contractor to base the planning and implementation of diving operations on specific documents which include the operations manual.
The operations manual is considered an essential administrative risk control measure, and must be compiled by the contractor in consultation with representatives of the employees and the company's contracted diving medical practitioner. Members of the diving team are required to comply with the health and safety requirements imposed on them by the operations manual. Among other things that must be specified in the operations manual are the decompression tables or algorithms authorised for use by the dive teams, the quantities of breathing gas that must be available on site, based on the dive profile and equipment to be used, clear limits on the environmental hazards to which the divers may be exposed, and the actions required of each member of the dive team in the event of an emergency during operations.
Similar requirements may apply to commercial diving contractors in other jurisdictions. The IMCA Code of Practice for Offshore Diving also requires the contractor to provide an operations manual for each diving system.

Paul de Casabianca

Pierre-Paul de Casabianca (13 September 1839 – 12 March 1916) was French lawyer and Republican politician who was Senator of Corsica from 1885 to 1903.
Early years (1839–85).
Pierre-Paul de Casabianca was born in Bastia, Corsica, on 13 September 1839.
He was the brother of Joseph Luce de Casabianca().
He became a lawyer.
On 21 August 1881 he ran for election to the chamber of deputies as a Republican candidate and gained 6,533 votes against 7,406 for the Bonapartist candidate Denis Gavini, who was elected.
Casabianca was among the leaders of the Opportunist Republicans who supported Emmanuel Arène in his successful bid in the legislative by-election for the Corte constituency in 1881.
The Casabianca family was influential in the north of Corsica.
During the reform of the judicial organization, in August 1883 Casabianca's father became president of the Bastia Court of Appeal with two of his cousins as advisers.
The presidents of the courts of Corte and Bastia were both cousins of Casabianca, who was president of the Corsican general council from 1883 to 1885.
In the case of the railway from Ajaccio to Bastia the jurors who reviewed the expropriations were appointed by the general council, and Casabianca presented the case as lawyer for the railway company.
Senator (1885–1903).
On 25 January 1885 Casabianca was elected Senator of Corsica by 477 out of 744 votes.
He defeated the Bonapartist Joseph Marie Piétri, who won only 212 votes.
He sat with the moderate left.
Casabianca led the branch of the Corsican Republican party that rejected the former Bonapartist party and Arène's more extreme Republican group.
In the mid-1880s he was the main republican leader, while Arène was still only his lieutenant and not yet "King of Corsica."
He supported the successive ministries.
In the last session he voted for reinstatement of the single-member ballot, for the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press, and abstained from voting on the case of General Boulanger.
In 1893 the Gavini and Casabianca families met in Vichy and made a pact to unite and seize political power from Arène and eliminate him from departmental decision making.
However, by 1895 Arène was again the undisputed master of Corsican politics.
Casabianca was reelected on 7 January 1894 in the first round by 434 out of 747 votes.
In the elections of 4 January 1903 he was defeated by Émile Combes.
In a by-election on 15 February 1903 Arthur Ranc was elected Senator for Corsica in place of Émile Combes, who had also been elected for Charente-Inférieure, which he had chosen to represent.
Last years (1903–16).
After losing his senate seat Casabianca renounced politics.
Although formerly president of the Corsican general council, he did not run in the 1910 cantonal elections.
However, he agreed to run for election to the senate on 7 January 1912 on his party's list against that of Paul Doumer, but was defeated.
He was elected to the general council for Vescovato.
He ran in the legislative elections on 26 April 1914, but retired after being beaten in the first round by Henri Pierangeli().
Casabianca died in Bastia on 12 March 1916 at the age of 77.

The collaborations shoe line was divided into two categories, the "Revealing" and "Ghosting". The Off-White and Nike designers had an updated take on Nineties-style shoes, with various patterns and different types of material such as plastic and tulle.
In 2017, the company collaborated with Champion developing sixteen items of clothing, including tracksuits, hoodies, fleeces, and t-shirts. In August 2017, the company also collaborated with A$AP Rocky with his label AWGE.

Ten Count (manga)

 is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Rihito Takarai, serialized in the manga magazine "Dear+" from 2013 to 2017. Two video game adaptations of the series have been produced. An anime adaptation has also been announced.
Plot.
Tadaomi Shirotani suffers from obsessive–compulsive disorder that manifests as severe mysophobia. He meets psychotherapist Riku Kurose, who recommends exposure and response prevention therapy and instructs Shirotani to write a list of ten actions he is unable to do:
Kurose tells Shirotani he will be cured once he completes the items on the list. Shirotani makes steady progress on the list, until Kurose abruptly suspends their sessions; when pressed, he admits he has fallen in love with Shirotani, and felt it would be inappropriate to continue as his therapist. Shirotani nevertheless wishes to continue their sessions, and they resume therapy while simultaneously initiating a sexual relationship. Through a flashback, it transpires that the root cause of Shirotani's mysophobia is a childhood trauma of witnessing his father having sex: the self-loathing he experienced after becoming aroused by the sight of his father, combined with the shame of being caught masturbating to the incident, prompted him to associate physical contact and intimacy with feelings of disgust.
As Kurose and Shirotani's relationship intensifies, Kurose notes that Shirotani is simultaneously repulsed and sexually aroused by his advances. Kurose reveals that he is a sadist who derives pleasure from triggering Shirotani's mysophobia, and has intuited that Shirotani is a masochist who derives pleasure from the very acts that disgust him. Shirotani rejects Kurose, and they do not speak for many months. After a chance encounter, Kurose and Shirotani reconcile their relationship. Shirotani reveals the tenth item on his list – to be patted on the head, an act he associates with his father – and admits that he loves Kurose. Shirotani finds he is now comfortable enough to reciprocate Kurose sexually.
In an epilogue, Kurose quits his clinic job to study for a doctorate in psychology. Shirotani, having completed the list, has significantly alleviated the symptoms of his mysophobia. Kurose admits that he was lying when said that completing the list would cure Shirotani's mysophobia, and proposes a second list to make amends: a list of ten actions that Shirotani wishes for Kurose to do.

Phillip Brian Harper is a literary scholar and cultural critic. He currently serves as the Dean for the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at New York University. Harper is best known for his work in modern and contemporary literature, African American literature and culture, and gender and sexuality studies.
Work.
Harper's fields of study include modern and contemporary U.S. literary and cultural studies; African American literary, cultural, and fine art studies; aesthetics and social theory; and gender and sexuality studies.
His 1997 book, "Private Affairs: Critical Ventures in the Culture of Social Relations", he explores the social and cultural significance of the private, proposing that privacy is limited by one's racial-and sexual-minority status. Art critic Douglas Crimp wrote," "Private Affairs" teaches us how thoroughly complex is the negotiation of privacy and publicity when we attend to gender and sexuality, race and class."
In 2015, Harper published "Abstractionist Aesthetics: Artistic Form and Social Critique in African American Culture", a series of essays arguing for displacing realism as the primary mode of African American representational aesthetics. Rather, Harper argues, cultural producers should re-center literature as a principal site of African American cultural politics and elevate experimental prose within the domain of African American literature. The book explored the artistic practices of visual artists Fred Wilson and Kara Walker, the music of Billie Holiday and Cecil Taylor, and the writings of Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and John Keen. Professor Brent Hayes Edwards of Columbia University wrote, 
Harper was previously Director of Graduate Studies of American Studies, English, and SCA; Director of the American Studies and Gender and Sexuality Programs; and Chair of the Department of English.

Reply was an app by Area 120, Google's experimental workshop, released to closed beta testing in February 2018, and shortly after reported as leaked. The app allowed users to insert pre-defined replies called "Smart Replies" into conversations on messaging apps on their phone such as Facebook Messenger, Slack and Google Hangouts. The beta testing was cancelled in October, 2018.
Reply suggested various responses to questions or statements based on statements by the user's conversation partner. The suggested replies varied according to the type of incoming message (detected by the tone, contents of the message, and the user's context, which may trigger "Vacation responder" or "Urgent" types of automatic replies). Additionally, based on the phone accelerometer, Reply was able to determine whether the user was in a vehicle or biking and could auto-respond appropriately. It could also reply appropriately when the user was sleeping. The user can see the suggested responses in their notifications and decide if they want to send one of them from the notification without having to open the app in which the response is sent.

Jim Scott (trade unionist)

James Scott (1900 – 21 January 1962) was a Scottish trade unionist.
Scott was born in West Lothian. When he was fifteen years old, he joined the Royal Navy, serving during World War I. In 1919, he moved to work in the Merchant Navy, in ships' engine rooms. He remained in this post until 1934, when he was appointed as the National Union of Seamen's (NUS) full-time delegate in Glasgow.
Scott continued his career with the NUS when, in 1940, he was appointed as a branch secretary in Grangemouth, then four years later, he became the union's representative in Mumbai, soon moving on to similar posts in Canada and the United States. He returned to the UK in 1947, when he became a special organiser for Merseyside, then London District Secretary in 1948 and Mersey District Secretary in 1950. He was promoted to become National Organiser in 1955, and then elected as the union's treasurer and an assistant general secretary in 1959. While in the post, he ended a major unofficial strike, organised by the National Seamen's Reform Movement, by persuading North American maritime unions to stop funding the movement. He subsequently organised the expulsion of two NUS members, who he claimed were leaders of the movement.
In 1960, Scott was elected as General Secretary of the NUS, beating William Sinclair, George Lipman and Thomas Sutton, and taking up the post at the start of the following year. Alongside leading the union, he was elected to serve on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress, the National Maritime Board, the Merchant Navy Welfare Board, the council of Ruskin College, and the executive of the International Transport Workers' Federation.
As leader of the NUS, Scott began planning a reorganisation of the union, with the aim of reducing dissatisfaction among members about their lack of input into the union and its close co-operation with employers. However, he became ill, and Lipman had to take over his duties. Scott died early in 1962, just over a year after taking up office.

Angel of H.E.A.T.

Angel of H.E.A.T. is an American science fiction softcore sex comedy film directed and produced by Myrl A. Schreibman and starring Marilyn Chambers.
Production.
"Angel of H.E.A.T." was filmed in 1981 under the title "The Protectors, Book #1". The film was shot in the Lake Tahoe region.
Release.
Lor of "Variety" stated that by 1983 the theatrical market for films like "Angel of H.E.A.T." had changed so much that the film was unreleased and shown as "cable-tv filler" and as a home video title. The film was first released in 1983, and on DVD on January 13, 2004 by Monterey Video.
Reception.
Lor gave the film a negative review, noting poorly executed martial arts sequences, and that the film "wanders for the first few reels, with lots of dumb puns, bare breasts and failed gags". In his book reviewing horror and science fiction films, Donald Willis declared the film to be "failed semi-camp" and that it was "iffy even as a showcase for Marilyn Chambers" noting that the filmmakers seemed to believe that the narrative would be of more interest than Chambers' role which, he considered a "bad miscalculation".

Neuroprostanes

The neuroprostanes are prostaglandin-like compounds formed "in vivo" from the free radical-catalyzed peroxidation
of essential fatty acids (primarily docosahexaenoic acid) without the direct action of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The result is the formation of isoprostane-like compounds F4-, D4-, E4-, A4-, and J4-neuroprostanes which have been shown to be produced in vivo. These oxygenated essential fatty acids possess potent biological activity as anti-inflammatory mediators inhibiting the response of human macrophages that augment the perception of pain.

Elisapee Ishulutaq

Elisapee Ishulutaq ( , 1925 – 9 December 2018) was a self-taught Inuit artist, specialising in drawing and printmaking. Ishulutaq participated in the rise of print and tapestry making in Pangnirtung and was a co-founder of the Uqqurmiut Centre for Arts &amp; Crafts, which is both an economic and cultural mainstay in Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq was also a community elder in the town of Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq's work has been shown in numerous institutions, including the Marion Scott Gallery in Vancouver, the Winnipeg Art Gallery and the National Gallery of Canada.
Ishulutaq saw herself as a bridge between generations, using visual representations to pass on the wisdom of her community's elders. In 2014, Ishulutaq was awarded the Order of Canada "for her contributions to the cultural and economic health of her community as a role model and mentor".
Early life and family.
Elisapee Ishulutaq was born 1925 in Kangirterjuak Camp, Northwest Territories. In the 1930s Ishulutaq lived off the land of Baffin Island near Cumberland Sound with her family, including her mother Avurnirq, father Arnaqua, sister Malaya, and adopted brother Silassie Arnaquq. Although little is known about her early life, as a child she lived a nomadic hunting life which is the source of her inspiration in many of her later works. Elisapee Ishulutaq started her artistic career relatively late in life, after she moved to Pangnirtung at the age of forty-five.
Ishulutaq's oil stick drawing "Nunagah" (2009) portrays many members of Ishulutaq's family including her parents, her siblings, her husband Kanayuk, and firstborn son Lasalucie. Jaco Ishulutaq, another of Ishulutaq's sons (not depicted in "Nunagah"), has become a well known carver in Pangnirtung.
Political focus.
In addition to her works documenting her childhood, some of Elisapee Ishulutaq's recent work deals with two arctic political agendas: advocacy for the suicide crisis within Inuit communities in the arctic, and environmentalism.
Works related to Inuit suicide.
Ishulutaq's work "In His Memory" (2016) depicts scenes from her community in the 1990s after a young boy committed suicide. It is a 9-metre-long drawing split into four images: (1) people leaving a grave; (2) mourners walking towards a church; (3) a figure standing on shore in front of a boat; and (4) a figure lying alongside a seated woman with the subtitle "Vigil with Bird". While making the art piece, Ishulutaq encouraged children into the room to make their own drawings with her. About "In His Memory", Ishulutaq has said that: "I drew it so that young people would not choose suicide as a solution to their problems".
"In His Memory" was exhibited in the Marion Scott Gallery/Kardosh Projects in Vancouver in 2016. News organisations such as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the "Vancouver Sun" reported on the project.
Works related to environmentalism.
Some of Ishulutaq's works focus on climate change such as the work titled "Climate Change" (2012). Ishulutaq has commented on environmentalism in art as follows:"When I was young the ice was not dangerous... now it's getting dangerous, and through art artists can get it out there, sharing that the ice is getting dangerous. Nowadays hunters don't really listen to elders for their knowledge or wisdom and having some sort of visual aid like art would really put a clearer picture into what the elders are trying to say."Ishulutaq also appears in Zacharias Kunuk and Ian Mauro's film "Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change" (2010). This is the first Inuktitut-language film that addresses global warming, considering Inuit traditional knowledge and its role in discourse of environmentalism.
Artistic career.
Elisapee Ishulutaq worked primarily in oil stick since 2009, however she began drawing with colored pencils in 1960. At the age of 45 Ishulutaq moved to Pangnirtung, and began to contribute illustrations to the Pangnirtung print and tapestry workshops. Ishulutaq has been a contributor to the Pangnirtung print and tapestry workshops for 40 years, as long as the arts and crafts industry has existed in Pangnirtung. Ishulutaq was also one of the original contributors to the Pangnirtung annual catalogue of prints. Ishulutaq is the last living artist to have contributed to this original catalogue that was published in 1973. For her drawings that have been translated into prints, Ishulutaq collaborated on many occasions with artist Paul Machnik, the founder of PM Studios in Montreal.
Artistic inspiration.
Many of her recent oil stick drawings are large-scale pieces; for example, her work "In His Memory" (2016) is 30 meters long, and "Nunagah" (2009) is 5 feet tall and 30 feet long. Her works often depict autobiographical scenes, which differs from common Inuit subject matter of contemporary life. Ishulutaq's works often explore the hardships she faced growing up. Ishulutaq's works are characterised by her use of multiple perspectives in the same image and focus on everyday life. Ishulutaq claims that the concept of legacy was her initial incentive for the creation of art: "The main reason for making art being that the future generations could see my work... I would leave a footprint so to speak... to be able to share history through images."Ishulutaq believed that art can help bridge the gap between elders and the younger generation, using visual motifs to pass along knowledge that would otherwise have been lost. She has also said that art was therapeutic and could help an individual work through anxieties. Ishulutaq remained an active participant in the Pangnirtung workshop until her death, continuing to explore new styles of art and new media.
Early works.
Ishulutaq began contributing to the print workshop in 1970–1971. Early prints from Ishulutaq's drawings often included multiple perspectives, and large solitary figures of people, birds, and people, floating on a neutral background. During the establishment of the Tapestry Studio in Pangnirtung in the early 1970s, Ishulutaq and Malaya Akulukjuk were the workshop's sole illustrators. Ishulutaq's drawings were included in the first exhibition of Pagnirtung tapestries, "In the Beginning", which was held in 1972 at the Canadian Guild of Crafts in Montreal. This exhibition included Ishulutaq's drawing "Woman", which was woven by Oleepa Papatsie-Brown.
Recent works.
In 2009, Ishulutaq created the work "Nunagah (My Home Place)" as part of the 2012 Canadian Biennial with the National Gallery of Canada. The Biennial was entitled "Builders" referring to the contribution of artists such as Ishulutaq to contemporary art and art mentorship. In 2014, Ishulutaq was commissioned to create a mural titled "Yesterday and Today" for the Winnipeg Art Gallery. This mural features scenes of the artist's everyday life and was commissioned by curator Darlene Coward Wight, who said this of Ishulutaq's work:"Her use of multiple perspectives, employing frontal, profile, and bird’s eye view in the same image is also characteristic, and these unexpected shifts add interests and liveliness to her detailed scenes."In 2016, Ishulutaq was commissioned to create the mural "In His Memory" as a memorial to the suicide of a young boy in her community. This piece was created in collaboration with the students of the local school as well as the artists Paul Machnik and his daughter Maica Armata-Machnik. This mural was reportedly Ishulutaq's "finale", as the then-91-year-old artist claimed that she would no longer participate in any large-scale creations.
In 2013, Ishulutaq illustrated Vera Avic's Inuit children's story "Trip to the Moon".
Ishulutaq also continued to provide drawings for the yearly Pangnirtung Print Collection. In 2010, the collection contained 2 of Ishulutaq's drawings. The drawings depicted a scene from Pangnirtung and a streetscape of condominiums in Vancouver from a trip Ishulutaq took to British Columbia for an exhibition. The 2011 collection also included Ishulutaq's "International Formation: Two Canadians, one American &amp; one German Fly the Arctic".
Death.
Ishulutaq died on 9 December 2018 at her home in Pangnirtung, aged 93.
Awards.
Ishulutaq was part of the Pangnirtung experimental graphic workshop from 1970–1971. Shortly after in the year of 1973 at the California College of Arts and Crafts International Print Competition she won the award of merit for the design of her print "Three Bears". Her most notable award was in 2013, when she was made a member of the Order of Canada.
Collections.
Elisapee Ishulutaq's work is presented in private and public collections.
Symposiums.
Ishulutaq participated in the "Inuit Modern Symposium" at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Spring 2011. In this symposium, Inuit artists and thinkers, including Kenojuak Ashevak reflect on the question "It is not who we are, but where we come from and where we are going". The symposium was scheduled in conjunction with the opening of Inuit Modern: The Esther and Samual Sarick Collection of Inuit Art.

Andrzej Selerowicz

Andrzej Selerowicz (born 25 April 1948), originally from Poland, living in Austria, is a LGBT activist, writer and literature translator from the English and German languages into the Polish language.
Since 1976 he has been living in Vienna, Austria. He is a member of the LGBT organisation "Homosexuelle Initiative Wien" (HOSI Wien). Since 1982, he has been the chairman of EEIP (Eastern Europe Information Pool), as part of ILGA. He has been responsible for collecting and archiving an open, official, and accessible collection of media and publication sources about the situation of gays and lesbians in Eastern Europe until 1989. In 1984 he published a monograph about his research: 
Since 1983, he has supported the creation and development of the Polish gay and lesbian movement. Beginning in 1983, he started writing and spreading information among Polish gays with an illegal newsletter entitled "Etap", which later gave the name to the first LGBT clandestine group in Wrocław. In a 1984 edition, he first used the term "gej" in order to create a neutral sounding Polish substitution for "homosexual" to substitute for the many derogatory words that existed. Since then it has been a broadly accepted term in the Polish language.
From 1987 to 1988 he was a consultant for the Warszawski Ruch Homoseksualny (Warsaw Gay Movement). As there were no books about being LGBT, and the issue was completely taboo in Polish media, he started translating and editing (from English and German) classical and well-known homoerotic literature (Wilde, Baldwin, etc.). Starting in 1990 he cooperated for 10 years with the editorial staff of the Polish magazine in Poznań, regularly writing articles and essays. In Poland, he published books referring to LGBT themes:
His participation in the Polish LGBT movement has been mentioned in:
He translated these books into Polish:
In 2000, he worked at the Documentation Centre of Austrian Resistance archives in Vienna, where he collaborated in the research about the persecution by the German and Austrian Nazis and about bringing them to trial after World War II. He was also coauthor of research results published in 2009 in Austria. He took part in several scientific conferences in Austria, Germany and Poland about this topic and published several articles.
On the occasion of the 30th anniversary of Operation Hyacinth, he published a novel, combining authentic historical facts with a fictional story, giving a focused picture of the interrogation of 11,000 gay men by the police and security agents in Poland from 1985 to 1987 and the resulting "pink files". It was published in Cracow:

The War Between the Wars

The Campaign Between the Wars (Hebrew: המערכה בין המלחמות or מב"ם lit. the military campaign between wars) refers to the targeted covert inter-war campaign waged by the State of Israel. This is done through the IDF and the Israeli Intelligence Community, by preventing Israel's enemies, whomsoever they may be, from developing capabilities that will enable them to violate Israel's balance of deterrence through detecting and selectively destroying emerging threats to Israel's security.
Among the activities attributed to Israel: the 2007 strike on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria (Operation Outside the Box), the assassination of Syrian General Muhammad Suleiman (although not publicly attributed to Israel, only that Israel was consulted on the assassination), Imad Mughniyah, the military commander of Hezbollah and his son, and Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. The Israeli attack in Sudan (2009) during Operation Cast Lead, the May 2013 attacks on Iranian arms shipments to Hezbollah in Damascus, the January 2013 attack on the Syrian arms convoy in the Rif region of Damascus, the February 2014 attack on the Syrian arms convoy to Hezbollah in Baalbek, activities against the Iranian nuclear program, and the delivery of about 800 bombs against 200 targets across Syria in 2017–2018.

Archotermopsidae

Archotermopsidae is a family of termites in the order Blattodea, known as dampwood termites, formerly included within the family Termopsidae. They constitute a small and rather primitive family with five extant genera and 13–20 living species. They may be a nuisance, but compared to the drywood termites (Kalotermitidae), usually do not cause extensive damage to buildings or other man-made structures. As their name implies, they eat wood that is not dried out, perhaps even rotting, and consequently of little use to humans.
Taxonomy.
In 2009, the five extant genera from the family Termopsidae ("Archotermopsis", "Hodotermopsis", "Porotermes", "Stolotermes", and "Zootermopsis") were moved to a newly created family, Archotermopsidae ("Zootermopsis" had previously been treated as part of the family Hodotermitidae), so that the family Termopsidae now includes only fossil taxa: "Asiatermes", "Huaxiatermes", and "Mesotermopsis" (Early Cretaceous of China); "Cretatermes carpenteri" (Upper Cretaceous of Labrador); "Lutetiatermes prisca" (Upper Cretaceous amber of France); "Paleotermopsis oligocenicus" (Upper Oligocene of France); "Parotermes insignis" (Oligocene of Colorado); and "Valditermes" (incertae sedis). The genera "Porotermes" and "Stolotermes" were later placed into a separate family, Stolotermitidae.

Dwight Bishop

Dwight Bishop (July 30, 1955–July 16, 2004) was an American rock climber. Known for his technical skill as a climber and guide, he died from a fall while free solo climbing in the Teton Range.
Biography.
Bishop was born at Fort Benning, Georgia on July 30, 1955, to John Bishop, a soldier, and Geraldine ("née" Han) Bishop. He studied physical therapy at Montana State University and the University of Montana. He worked at his family's equipment rental business in Butte, Montana.
Climbing.
Bishop achieved recognition in the climbing community for his ascents of many exceptionally demanding routes, such as the Eiger peak in the Bernese Alps. However, much of his climbing efforts were concentrated in the Teton Range in the northwestern United States. He made several ascents of the many peaks in this range, many of them by free solo climbing and some during winter.
Bishop was a prominent climbing guide in the Tetons and published a handbook for climbers in the area, "Butte's Climbing Guide".
Death.
During an attempt to free solo the Grand Traverse climbing route of the Grand Teton peak and several other peaks within a single day, Bishop fell to his death on July 16, 2004; his body was found after a two-day search. Many of his fellow climbers expressed surprise at his unlikely death on a mountain with which he had extensive experience and was well within his skill range. His ashes were scattered in the Grand Tetons.
Other ventures.
Bishop was an avid long-distance cyclist and competed in the Race Across America cycling contest in 1993 and 2000. He also had studied taekwondo in Japan for two years and was a third-degree black belt in the sport.

Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1984 by Kai Yung Lang, as "Amitostigma gonggashanicum". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Amitostigma", "Neottianthe" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed.

Aculus tetanothrix

Aculus tetanothrix is a species of mite which causes galls on the leaves of willows ("Salix" species). It was first described by Alfred Nalepa in 1889.
Description of the gall.
The gall is a green or reddish, rounded pouch or pustule on the upperside of a leaf, which also protrudes on the lower surface of the leaf. There is a slit-like opening on the underside of the leaf which, when mature, is hairy inside but the hairs do not protrude outside of the gall. Many mites can be seen within the opening.
The galls are found on white willow ("S. alba"), eared willow ("S. aurita"), grey willow ("S. cinerea"), "S. eriocephala", crack willow ("S. fragilis"), "S. integra, bay willow ("S. pentandra"), purple willow ("S. purpurea"), Sitka willow ("S. sitchensis"), "S. smithiana", almond willow ("S. triandra") and common ossier ("S. viminalis").
It is possible that "A. tetanothrix" is one of a number of closely related species, and the galls on "S. alba" could be caused by "A. salicisalbae".
Distribution.
"Aculus tetanothrix" has been recorded from Germany, Slovenia, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales), the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the USA.

McGowan's 2007 book, "The Divine Spiration of Scripture" "led to some considerable discussion in evangelical circles." In it, McGowan suggested the word "spiration" in place of "inspiration" and argued against the concept of biblical inerrancy, instead being in favour of a type of infallibility. Norman Geisler and William C. Roach suggest that McGowan's "challenge to inerrancy is one of the most dangerous because it is clear, direct, and comes from within evangelicalism."

Alice H. Parker

Alice H. Parker (1895 – 1920) was an African American inventor known for her patent for a gas furnace.
Early life.
Alice H. Parker was born in 1895 in Morrison, New Jersey, where she grew up most of her life. Parker was a highly educated woman who graduated with honors in 1910 from Howard University Academy, a historically African-American university that accepted both male and female students since its founding in November 1866, shortly after the Civil War. According to census data, Parker worked as a cook in the kitchen in Morristown, NJ and lived with her husband, who was a butler. Unfortunately, despite her revolutionary impact on today's modern heating system, there is little to no information recorded on her personal life. Although the specific date of her death is unknown, it is thought she died in 1920 due to thermal shock.
Invention.
At the time, central gas heating has yet to be developed, so people relied on burning coal or wood as their main source of heating. While furnaces and the concept of central heating have been around since the Roman Empire, the science hardly advanced in the years that followed, and the heating methods utilized by the end of the nineteenth century were still relatively primitive in nature.
Parker felt that the fireplace alone, was not enough to keep her and her home warm during the cold Jersey winter, and went on to design the first gas furnace that was powered by natural gas and the first heating system to contain individually controlled air ducts that distributed heat evenly throughout the building. In more technical terms, Parker's heating system used independently controlled burner units that drew in cold air and conveyed the heat through a heat exchanger. This air was then fed into individual ducts to control the amount of heat in different areas. What made her invention particularly unique, was that it was a form of "zone heating" where temperature can be moderated in different parts of a building. Parker filed a patent for a her design of the heating furnace in 1919. She then received patent No. US132590A for her design on December 23, 1919.
Although the invention had a massive positive impacts, it also came with a few downsides. Her design posed a few health and safety risks as it made certain appliances like the oven, more flammable and unsafe to touch. The regulation of the heat flow also posed a few security risks. On the other hand, Parkers invention also decreased the risk of house or building fires that heating units posed by eliminating the need to leave a burning fireplace on throughout the night. With her idea for a furnace used with modifications to eliminate safety concerns, it inspired and led the way to features such as thermostats, zone heating and forced air furnaces, which are common features of modern central heating. Additionally, by using natural gas it heated homes much more efficiently than wood or coal counterparts (which were more time consuming and expensive). Parkers invention was further improved in 1935 by scientists who created forced convection wall heaters that use a coal furnace, electric fan, and ductwork throughout a home. Nowadays homes utilize thermostat and a forced air furnace which can be attributed to Parker's design and invention of the central heating furnace. Her filing of the patent precedes both the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Liberation Movement, which made her accomplishments especially impressive, as it removed many barriers for black women of her generation.
Legacy.
In 2019, the National Society of Black Physicists honored Parker as an "African American inventor famous for her patented system of central heating using natural gas." It called her invention a "revolutionary idea" for the 1920s, "that conserved energy and paved the way for the central heating systems". The New Jersey Chamber of Commerce established the Alice H. Parker Women Leaders in Innovation Awards to honor women who use their "talent, hard work and ‘outside-the-box’ thinking to create economic opportunities and help make New Jersey a better place to live and work." Parker and her patent are mentioned in "Black Women in America: An Historical Encyclopedia".

Elizaveta Vodovozova

Elizaveta Nikolayevna Vodovozova (, née Tsevlovskaya, , 17 August 1844, Demidov, Smolensk Governorate, Imperial Russia, — 23 March 1923, Petrograd, USSR) was a Russian children's writer, educational theorist and memoirist, the wife of Vasily Vodovozov.
An 1862 Smolny Institute graduate, she started writing in 1863 on issues of women's emancipation and pedagogy for the magazines like "Detskoye Chteniye" and "Narodnaya Shkola". Her debut publication, "What Stops a Woman from Becoming Independent?" (published by "Biblioteka Dlya Chtenya" in September 1863) came as a direct response to Nikolai Chernyshevsky's novel "What Is to Be Done?".
Many of Vodovozova's ideas originated during an extensive trip over Belgium, Germany, England, Switzerland and France which she and her husband Vasily Ivanovich undertook soon after their marriage in April 1862, in order to investigate the theories of Friedrich Fröbel and how they worked in practice. Her influential book "Intellectual Development of Children" (Умственное развитие детей от первого появления сознания до восьмилетнего возраста, 1871) enjoyed seven re-issues in pre-1917 Russia. A strong proponent of the idea of the active use of music and games as educational and developmental means, she published a book "Russian Folk Songs for One Voice and Active Games for Children" (Одноголосые детские песни и подвижные игры с русскими народными мелодиями, 1876) as a supplement to her own educational program. Highly popular at the time were Vodovozova's children's stories. Many of them were collected in her books "From Russian Life and Nature" (Из русской жизни и природы, 1871—1872) and "For Leisure" (На отдых, 1880).
For decades Vodovozova's most important work was considered to be her magnum opus "The Life of the Peoples of Europe. Narratives in Geography" (Жизнь европейских народов. Географические рассказы, 1875—1883), reissued in ten volumes as "How People of Different Nations Live" (Как люди на белом свете живут, 1894—1901). In retrospect, though, the truly lasting part of her legacy proved to be her numerous memoirs and biographical sketches. Much lauded were her books "Among the Petersburg Youth of the Sixties" (Среди петербургской молодёжи шестидесятых годов, 1911) and "Things Long Gone" (Из давнопрошедшего, 1915). Vodovozova's best biographical and analytical works, including the essays on Konstantin Ushinsky, Vasily Sleptsov and Vasily Semevsky (her second husband whom she married in 1886, after Vodovozov's death), were collected in her two best-known books, "At the Dawn of Life" (На заре жизни, 1911) and "Dreams and Reality" (Грёзы и действительность, 1918).

August 2019 After the latest $400m raising, new investors now include the €23bn Paris and London fund Tikehau Capital, and the $US105bn Boston-based alternative investment firm Bain Capital.
In September 2019 Judo Bank enters the retail deposits and named as best Aussie startup to work for, according to LinkedIn's second annual top startups list.

"Mozo Experts Choice Awards showcase providers who outperformed their competitors in delivering a great product to customers," said Mozo's Kirsty Lamont, "Judo scooped one of the top awards after being compared with 68 term deposit accounts, offering some of the best interest rates across short, medium and long term investments, which is no small feat."
In March 2020 Judo Bank signs a further three-year, $350 million committed debt facility with Citi Bank bringing the total to $1billion on top of the $1.3 billion in government-guaranteed customer deposits. "As in the global financial crisis, deposits are flowing to the banking sector, including us" said David Hornery Co CEO 
On Thursday, 2 April 2020, the government announced that it would invest an initial $250 million into Judo Bank's lending warehouse through the Australian Office of Financial Management's (AOFM) Australian Business Securitisation Fund and a further $250 million through its recently announced Structured Finance Support Fund (SFSF). The investment from the AOFM makes Judo Bank the first recipient of capital from the government's $2 billion small and medium enterprise funding scheme that was unveiled in November 2018.

"The support we’ve received for our third round, at an increased valuation to our second round capital raise last year, underscores the confidence and commitment our existing investors have in Judo, particularly at a time of extreme volatility in global markets, that has impacted all bank valuations," Mr Hornery said in a statement.

Operations.
Judo is following the SME challenger bank model developed by Aldermore, Shawbrook Bank and OakNorth Bank in the UK.
Political commentary.
Small Business &amp; Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell says Judo Bank's launch is well-timed with the lending shortfall continuing to grow. "There is no competition", Carnell said. "The big four banks have 80 percent plus of the SME lending market and they mostly don't lend except if it is secured against property and that means access to capital is very difficult for many SMEs."
Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison gave a virtual speech at the Singapore FinTech Festival on 8 December 2020, speaking about fintechs' positive impact on the economic recovery, referring to Judo and four Australian fintechs in particular. "I am incredibly proud of what our Aussie start-ups and early age ventures are achieving, as well as our well-established unicorns and what they’re achieving. You know some of them: Atlassian, Airwallex, Afterpay, Judo Bank, Athena Home Loans."

He previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox. He made his MLB debut during 2018 after a decade of minor and independent league baseball.

Career.
Walden attended Central High School in Fresno, California, and Fresno City College. 
Toronto Blue Jays.
The Toronto Blue Jays selected Walden in the ninth round of the 2007 MLB draft.
After pitching with Toronto's Rookie League and Class A Short-Season teams during 2007 and 2008, Walden missed most of the 2009 season and the entire 2010 season due to shoulder and elbow injuries that required surgeries, including Tommy John surgery. He returned to pitch for several Toronto farm teams during the 2011 through 2014 seasons, ultimately being promoted to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. The Blue Jays promoted Walden to the major leagues in April 2014, but they optioned him back to the minor leagues five days later without using him in a major league game. Six days later, Walden was designated for assignment by the Blue Jays.
Oakland Athletics.
Walden was claimed off of waivers by the Oakland Athletics in April 2014, and he spent the remainder of the season with Oakland's Double-A and Triple-A teams. In 2015, Walden signed with the Cincinnati Reds organization and began the season with the Pensacola Blue Wahoos of the Double-A Southern League. He was released, and signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent baseball league. 
Minnesota Twins.
Walden signed with the Minnesota Twins organization for the 2016 season. He split time between their Double-A and Triple-A affiliates, appearing in a combined 42 games with a 2.40 ERA and 1.065 WHIP with six saves and 40 strikeouts in innings pitched.

After pitching effectively during spring training, Walden was named to the Opening Day 25-man roster for the 2018 Boston Red Sox, expected to be the long reliever for rookie manager Alex Cora. Walden made his major league debut on April 1, pitching innings of relief against the Tampa Bay Rays, giving up no runs and one hit while facing five batters. On April 14, he earned his first save, pitching three innings of relief in a 10–3 win over the Baltimore Orioles. He was sent down to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox before the end of the month, was recalled very briefly in early May, and then spent the remainder of the season in the minors. With Boston, he appeared in a total of eight games with a 0–0 record and one save, while recording a 3.68 ERA and 14 strikeouts in innings.
In 2019, Walden was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket prior to Opening Day. He was called up on April 6, when Brian Johnson was placed on the injured list, and recorded his first MLB win the next day, pitching two innings of scoreless relief in a 1–0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He was optioned back to Pawtucket effective on April 16, then recalled to Boston on April 19. Overall with the 2019 Red Sox, Walden appeared in 70 games, compiling a 9–2 record with 3.81 ERA and 76 strikeouts in 78 innings.
In 2020, Walden was on Boston's active roster at the delayed start of the season. He was optioned to the team's alternate training site on August 19, and recalled on September 3. Overall with the 2020 Red Sox, Walden appeared in 15 games, all in relief, compiling an 0–2 record with 9.45 ERA and 10 strikeouts in innings pitched.
On February 24, 2021, Walden was designated for assignment by the Red Sox after the signing of Marwin González was made official. On March 1, Walden was outrighted to Triple-A and invited to spring training as a non-roster invitee. In 27 appearances for the Triple-A Worcester Red Sox, Walden recorded a 5-3 record with a 4.01 ERA and 40 strikeouts. On August 7, 2021, Walden was released by the Red Sox.
Chicago Cubs.
On August 19, 2021, Walden signed a minor league deal with the Chicago Cubs.
Personal life.
Walden and his wife, Nichole, have two daughters, Sutton and Palmer. Walden and two business partners opened the DIB Baseball Academy in Fresno in 2015.

Unicorn (web server)

Unicorn is a Rack HTTP server to serve Ruby web applications on UNIX environment. It is optimised to be used with nginx. It is based on now deprecated Mongrel 1.1.5 from 2008.
Architecture.
Unicorn uses a master/worker architecture, where a master process forks worker processes and controls them. The application runs in a single thread.
Reception and use.
Unicorn was considered as “one of the most popular servers for Rails”.
Twitter started to test Unicorn in 2010.
This server is shipped with Discourse. Their system administrator Sam Saffron noted Unicorn was reliable, as it reaps unresponsive workers. GitLab also uses Unicorn.
Unicorn inspired other projects like Gunicorn, a fork to run Python applications.
As of 2018, projects tend to favour Puma . The Heroku hosting provider recommends since 2015 to migrate from Unicorn to Puma. Deliveroo published a benchmark comparing the two servers and concluded “Puma performs better than Unicorn in all tests that were either heavily IO-bound or that interleaved IO and CPU work”, but that Unicorn was still slightly better performing in pure CPU situations.

Pact for Democracy

The Pact for Democracy is known by Dominicans as the agreement, act and / or agreement reached by José Francisco Peña Gómez and Joaquín Balaguer after the change in the electoral results of the 1994 elections in which Peña Gómez was the winner and Joaquín Balaguer altered the results declaring himself winner of the elections.
In the 1994 elections, the leader of the Social Christian Reformist Party (PRSC) Joaquín Balaguer remained in power, although on this occasion his mandate was reduced to two years. Balaguer proposed the signing of a Pact for Democracy in which he proposed reducing his mandate to two years and then deliver it to his closest competitor. That proposal was rejected by the PRD candidate. Given this situation, Balaguer agreed to reduce his period to 18 months and gave way to the holding of presidential elections on November 16, 1995.
However, by means of a document transference, a "Pact for Democracy" was signed, different from that agreed by the two leaders. Balaguer also had been in conversations with the PLD.
The agreement finally signed at the National Palace on August 10, 1994, established, among other aspects, the convening of the National Assembly in order to reform the Constitution to establish a new presidential election date, on May 16, 1996, and not in November 1995 as agreed, which separated them from the municipal and congressional elections, which would be in May 1998; prohibit re-election in two consecutive periods, and establish the second round if no candidate obtained more than 50 percent of the votes, as well as reforms to the judicial system.

John Alexander Fraser Roberts CBE FRS FRSE FRCP FRAI (1899–1987) was a 20th-century British geneticist and psychiatrist.
Life.
He was born on 8 September 1899 at Foxhall at Henllan near Denbigh in Wales, the first son of Robert Henry Roberts (1868-1951) a farmer, and his wife, Elizabeth (Lily) Mary Fraser. His mother was the daughter of Alexander Fraser of Caernarfon, from a long line of Scottish Highland drapers. He was educated at Denbigh Grammar School. His studies of Sciences at Bangor University where interrupted by the First World War during which (due to age) he served only in the final year, as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Returning to Bangor he graduated BSc in 1920. He then went to Cambridge University graduating BA in 1922 and MA in 1925.

1932 Catalan regional election

The 1932 Catalan regional election was held on Sunday, 20 November 1932, to elect the first legislature of the Parliament of the autonomous region of Catalonia.
It was the sole Catalan parliamentary election held during the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939). Between 1939 and 1980 the Parliament, as the rest of the institutions of the Generalitat of Catalonia, remained in exile as a consequence of the Republican defeat in the Spanish Civil War, and there wasn't another election until 1980.
All 85 seats in the Parliament were up for election. The Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC), led by the acting President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, Francesc Macià, was the winning party. the conservative Regionalist League, almost hegemonic in Catalonia during the reign of Alfonso XIII, reached the second place but far from the Republican Left. The third list was the Republican Catalanist Party, which won one seat.

Wheatstone system

The Wheatstone system was an automated telegraph system that replaced a human operator with machines capable of sending and recording Morse code at a consistent fast rate. The system included a perforator, which prepared punched paper tape called a Wheatstone slip, a transmitter that read the tape and converted the symbols into dots and dashes encoded as mark and space electric currents on the telegraph line, and a receiver at the other end of the telegraph line that printed the Morse symbols. The system was invented by Charles Wheatstone. Enhancements could be made so that it was a duplex system, able to send and receive on the same line simultaneously.
The Wheatstone slip was a paper tape that contained holes in a pattern to control the mark and space signals on the telegraph line. The paper tape was from 0.46 to 0.48 inches in width, (but the standard width is from 0.472 to 0.475 inches) and a standard thickness of 0.004 to 0.0045 inches. Olive oil coating lubricated the punch process. There were three rows of holes. The middle row forms a rack so that a star wheel can move the paper forward. Every used position on the tape has a middle hole punched. The top hole indicates when to turn on the mark signal on the line, and the bottom hole says to turn off the mark signal. Each vertical column represents a time interval in the Morse code, including the spacing between the holes. The holes are spaced 0.1 inches apart. A column of three holes turns on the mark at the beginning of the interval, and turns it off at the end making a dot. If there is a top hole without a bottom, and then the next column has a bottom without a top hole, mark is on for three intervals, and a dash is represented. If there is only a centre hole, then nothing changes, and this would normally be used to put in space between letters and words.
The Wheatstone perforator was a development of Alexander Bain's 1848 manually operated hole punch machine for his "fast telegraph". It produced Wheatstone slips using three buttons (or keys) labelled "A", "A1" and "A2". "A" punched the pattern for dot, "A1" punched the pattern for space, and "A2" punched the dash pattern in two columns. The keys were so difficult to press that fist-held rubber-tipped mallets were used to depress them and operate the punches. Using this, invalid combinations of holes could not be produced. The blank paper tape was fed in from the right over a roller and came out the left side. It was oriented in a vertical plane. The paper punches were labelled with numbers: 1 for the top hole of the dot, 2 for the sprocket hole for dot, and 3 for the bottom hole for dot. When a dash was punched, extra hole punches to the right punched a centre hole with number 4 and a bottom hole with number 5. The perforator was introduced in 1867. It enabled transmission speeds on a telegraph line to increase to 70 words per minute. The very first message ever punched onto a tape was "SOS EIOS". The manual perforator was subsequently replaced by keyboard perforators like the Gell keyboard perforator or Kleinschmidt keyboard perforator.
Each of the keys had a spring to restore its position after pressing. Each key moved a corresponding lever underneath the instrument. The other end of the levers protruded up into the back of the mechanism. Each punch rod also had a spring to put it back in place after punching a hole. For space and dot keying (A or A1) the star wheel was only allowed to turn one position by a pawl, and the paper tape only moved forward one position. However, when key A2 was hit, the corresponding lever B2 raised a bar (h) which allowed another lever attached to the pawl to move further back when the star wheel rotated, and the wheel could turn two positions, for a dash. The distance the paper tape moved for each position was determined by how far lever k moved, and its range of movement had to be set by adjusting screws i and t. A flat spring g stored energy from the punch to move the paper. The force of the spring was determined by adjusting screws n and n'. A guide roller (r) with a groove was pressed by an adjustable spring to press the pawl against the star wheel. The star wheel was on a frame with a piece sticking out the left hand side as a lever. When the operator wanted to insert paper tape, this lever was pulled, and the star wheel retracted from the paper.
The Wheatstone transmitter read a paper tape (Wheatstone slip) and converted the dot pattern into mark and space symbols on the telegraph line. It worked by two rods alternately rising up to sample the holes in the tape. First of all the top hole was probed, and if the rod could go through, it moved a compound lever that connected the mark signal to the line. With no hole the lever remained unmoved. Next the top hole rod dropped and the bottom hole rod checked whether there was a bottom hole in the tape. If there was, the compound lever was moved back to connect the space signal on the line. If there was no hole, the compound lever was left alone as it was. An extra switch enabled the transmitter to be bypassed so that a Morse key could be used instead.
The Wheatstone receiver converted the signal on the telegraph line to an inked pattern on a paper strip. An electromagnet electrically connected to the telegraph line moved an inking wheel to press against the paper. A clockwork mechanism advanced the paper tape, and turned the inking wheel, and an ink supply wheel. The paper advance speed could be adjusted between 7 and 60 feet per minute. Power to the clockwork had three sources: it could be a coiled spring, a weight, or an electric motor. Paper spools were stored in drawers beneath the reader to allow quick change when one was exhausted. The ink supply wheel turned in an inkwell. The machine was started and stopped by use of a lever. In electrical characteristics, the electromagnet had two windings, each of 100 ohms resistance. These could be connected in parallel or series to achieve a 50 or 200 ohm resistance, to better match the telegraph line. Other maintenance that might have been required was cleaning of the marker and supply wheels, adjusting the armature-coil spacing to avoid a marking or spacing bias, and cleaning the sounding tongue and contact points. 
The Wheatstone telegram consisted of strips of paper tape with the Morse code printed on it, pasted on a form. The telegram would later be retyped to make a final presentable message for the recipient.

Chitoria modesta

Chitoria modesta is a butterfly found in the East Palearctic that belongs to the browns family. It is endemic to Southwest China (Yunnan)
Description from Seitz.
A. modesta Oberth. is similar in shape to "A. fasciola" ["Chitoria fasciola"] (p. 164) and does not appear to be specifically distinct. Upperside brown, forewing with an indistinct darker shadowy median band, likewise with a somewhat
darker shade in the apical and distal marginal areas. On the distal side of the shadowy band, near the costa,
there is an elongate whitish double spot, above and below the middle of the anterior median branch two small
more indistinct light spots, and near the apex a small rounded white spot with a white dot below it.
Both wings have a small indistinct ocellus in the anal area. The hindwing bears a dark edge to the outer margin
and a feebly marked submarginal row of spots. Beneath paler, the basal half of both wings somewhat darkened,
these spots with sharply defined S-shaped edges, otherwise the light spots as above, the ocelli with blue centre,
at the distal margin of both wings a narrow dark shadowy band and indistinct submarginal spots. — Western
China: Siao-lou, Moupin, Tieatsuen. The author compares modesta with "A. phaeacia" Hew.; we cannot see any
close affinity; but we learn from this remark by Oberthür that phaeacia, an Indian species, extends northward
to Tse-kou (Tibet). It will be dealt with in the volume on the Exotics.

Strangers' Home for Asiatics, Africans and South Sea Islanders

The Strangers' Home for Asiatics, Africans and South Sea Islanders (opened 1857) was a residential home in West India Dock Road, in the Limehouse district of London, that provided accommodation for Asian and black sailors (lascars), acted as a "repatriation centre" and was a platform for Christian missionary activity.
Foundation.
The home was founded after an appeal by Lieutenant Colonel R. M. Hughes, previously of the East India Company, and Joseph Salter of the London City Mission. The first donation was of £500 from Maharaja Duleep Singh, followed by a regular revenue from the East India Company and a lesser contribution from the Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (later P&amp;O). The architect was C.L. Bracebridge.
On 31 May 1856, the foundation stone was laid by Prince Albert and the Home finally opened in 1857. It was one of a number of homes founded in the area to deal with the problem of unemployed or destitute sailors.
Activities.
The home served as a repatriation centre where sailors could be sought and re-employed for return journeys to the East. It also provided temporary board and lodgings and functioned as a missionary centre. It was described by Count E. Armfelt in "Living London" (c. 1902) as having "reading and smoking and bagatelle rooms, bedrooms, baggage rooms, kitchens, and dining rooms, where every individual can cook and eat his meal with the ritual which his conscience commands him, undefiled by even the shadow of an infidel." More than 5,000 individuals were accommodated between 1857 and 1877.
Joseph Salter was one missionary from the Home that gave graphic accounts of the lives of the lascars who frequently took refuge here.
A Chinese community grew around the Home and the 1881 census recorded that of the 22 people who lived there, eleven were born in China, six in India or Sri Lanka, two in Arabia, two in Singapore and one in the Kru Coast of Africa. In 1886 the Home informed the India Office that they were evicting five Punjabi performers and a bear who could not pay their bills. In 1899, when Major General Chamier was honorary secretary of the Home, a group of eighteen Indian and Sri Lankan performers from a travelling show were left destitute at Marylebone station and took refuge at the Home after being dismissed by their manager.
Closure.
A lack of funds and the reduced numbers of sailors in need of help led to the closure of the Home in 1937. The site is now occupied by flats known as West India House, opened in 1946 by Clement Attlee.

List of K-pop music videos banned by South Korean television networks

The following is a non-exhaustive list of K-pop videos that have been banned by one or more South Korean television networks, for reasons such as suggestive or offensive lyrics and imagery.
K-pop is a genre of modern pop music that originates from South Korea. It is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements, and K-pop singles will typically include a music video and a dance routine. There is a history of media censorship and conservatism in South Korea, and as a result, many risque or explicit K-pop songs or videos have been banned by South Korean broadcasting stations. Other reasons for banning include having Japanese lyrics, negatively influencing youth, or the use of brand names.
KBS, MBC, and SBS are the three largest broadcasting and television networks, and they account for the vast majority of banned K-pop videos. As of September 2012, these networks had banned over 1,300 K-pop songs in the past three years alone. This list only includes titular k-pop songs that have an accompanying music video, but many K-pop songs that were not title tracks have been banned as well.
Aftermath of bans.
Revising.
Often, the entertainment company that owns the banned song will try to revise the song and have it reevaluated by the broadcasting company. They may edit the music video and delete the controversial scenes and re-release the new video. Other times, they may alter the explicit dance moves or change a song's lyrics so that the song may still be performed on music shows, such as Music Bank. In the case of EXO's "Lotto," which was banned due to the title being a brand name, the group sang the word "louder" instead of "lotto" while performing the song live. This revision allowed the song to be performed on KBS and MBC music shows.
Although K-pop songs and videos are often banned by KBS, is it less often for MBC or SBS to place a ban. Some groups are content to promote themselves on networks other than KBS and do not make any changes to their original material. In regards to PSY's "Gentlemen," a spokesperson for YG Entertainment said they had no plans to submit a different version of their video, and they followed the decision made by KBS.
When 12 out of 18 songs of Cheetah's album was deemed unfit for broadcast by KBS and five by SBS, the agency stated that they did not plan on making any changes to the lyrics in order to "keep the original intentions and meanings of the song."

Damianus (fl. 2nd century AD) was a member of the Second sophistic who lived in Ephesus. He is best known as a source for Philostratus, the author of "Lives of the Sophists", for his biographies of Aelius Aristides and Adrianus, as well as being a philanthropolist in his home town.
He was born to a wealthy and distinguished family, and was a student of Aristides and Adrianus. As a sophist, Damianus not only taught in Ephesus, but provided funds to support the city's poor but contributed funds to restore public buildings. Notable buildings include an elaborate marble portico to connect the city to the Temple of Artemis, and a large dining hall in the sanctuary of the Temple.
Damianus married the daughter of Publius Vedius Antoninus, a leading decurion of Ephesus; their descendants became members of the Roman Senate, including three consuls and two wives of consuls.

Early years.
Born Christine Nofchissey on December 21, 1948 in Morenci, Arizona, she was the fifth of nine children of Mark and Ethel Yazzie Nofchissey. McHorse lived off reservation in her childhood but spent summers in Fluted Rock, Arizona, herding sheep and learning about Navajo oral history from her grandmother, Zonith Bahe.
At age 14, McHorse was introduced to Picasso, Gaudi and Matisse at her boarding school, and she said these artists "opened a whole new world to us" (referring to herself and older sisters who were also attending the school). 
From 1963 to 1968, she studied at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA) in Santa Fe, New Mexico, when it was a high school for the arts on the campus of the Santa Fe Indian School. Originally intending to study glassblowing, she chose to study ceramics when the glassblowing major was discontinued the year she arrived, studying with Ralph Pardington (ceramics), Charles Loloma (jewelry), Allan Houser (foundry arts) and Fritz Scholder (design). She met her future husband Joel P. McHorse at IAIA and was influenced by her future grandmother-in-law, Lena Archuleta of Taos Pueblo, to begin working with ceramics.
Archuleta inspired and instructed McHorse in using the shimmering micaceous clay that was common to the Taos area, and McHorse continued to use that clay in her work.
Personal life.
In 1969 McHorse married Joel P. McHorse, a Taos Pueblo Indian and fellow art student whom she met at the Institute of American Indian Arts (IAIA). They had two children, Joel Christopher and Jonathan Thomas, originally living in Taos but later moving to Santa Fe.
Artwork and recognition.
McHorse's artwork draws inspiration from Navajo, Pueblo, and Anglo cultures. McHorse's pottery was created with a traditional coil-building method and she based her work on traditional Navajo designs and legends, influenced by the Pueblo artistry but her work is nontraditional in appearance.
Much of her work has a signature black surface, created by depriving the clay of oxygen during firing and making her creations popular in contemporary art venues. She preferred to do the firing in the traditional mode but used the electric kiln for pre-firing larger pieces, some up to two feet, to prevent the chance of breakage. She used cedarwood and cottonwood bark as fuel for her outdoor firing. Although commonly Navajo potters have applied boiled pinon-pine pitch to the surface of fired pots to make them waterproof, McHorse used the pitch to increase value contrast in her incised designs. 
Her large pottery has the sound of glass when tapped.
McHorse exhibited at Santa Fe Indian Market for 23 years, winning 38 awards for both pottery and sculpture. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Heard Museum, the Denver Art Museum, the National Museum of the American Indian, Navajo Nation Museum, and more. McHorse's work is also featured in the catalog "Dark Light: The Ceramics of Christine Nofchissey McHorse" (Fresco Fine Art Publications).
Death.
McHorse died from complications of COVID-19 on February 17, 2021, in Santa Fe during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Mexico. She was 72.

William Robert Dashiell

William Robert Dashiell (3 April 1863 – 16 March 1939) was a United States military officer. He notably participated in the Philippine–American War and World War I.
Early life and education.
Dashiell was born Mecklenburg County, Virginia on 3 April 1863. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1888, where he was a classmate of Peyton C. March. Dashiell later graduated from the Army School of the Line (1909) and the Army War College (1915).
Military career.
After graduation, Dashiell was commissioned Second Lieutenant with the 8th Infantry Regiment at Fort D. A. Russell in Wyoming. He took part in conflicts with American Indians, including the Sioux Campaign of 1890–1891 and while posted in Arizona and Utah 1896–1899.
In the interlude between 1892–1895, Dashiell was also a professor of Military Science and Tactics at the then North Georgia Agricultural College.
During the Spanish–American War, although Dashiell's regiment was in Cuba, he himself was posted as commander of Fort Douglas in Utah. In 1899, Dashiell took part in the Philippine–American War, as commander of Company C in the 24th Infantry under the ill-fated General Henry Lawton. Dashiell returned to the Philippines again for a second tour of duty from 1906–1908, during which he was briefly commander of Camp Downes on the island of Leyte and then commander of the island's Third District during a Pulahan uprising.
After returning from the Philippines, Dashiell was commander of the Madison Barracks in New York during 1908 and then commandant at Virginia Polytechnic Institute from 1909–1911. Dashiell was then stationed at various U.S. military installations from 1911–1917, including Fort Sheridan in Illinois, Fort Shafter in Hawaii and Fort Douglas in Utah.
Upon the U.S. entry into World War I, Dashiell was promoted to Brigadier General of the National Army on 12 April 1918 and arrived in France in July. There he commanded the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 6th Infantry Division, supporting the 1st Army during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Dashiell remained in France until 1919 and received a Silver Star for his service. After leaving France, Dashiell returned to Hawaii and was stationed for some time at Schofield Barracks.

Sandra Eaton

Sandra Eaton is an American chemist and Professor at the University of Denver, known for her work on electron paramagnetic resonance.
Education.
Eaton completed her bachelor's degree in chemistry at Wellesley College in 1968. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa at Wellesley and published her undergraduate research. She earned a PhD at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972.
Research.
Eaton joined the University of Colorado Denver in 1973 as an assistant professor. She received a National Science Foundation Visiting Professorship for Women in 1984, and joined the University of Denver, where she was appointed Professor in 1990.
Eaton is based in the EPR Center at the University of Denver. Her research is focused on electron paramagnetic resonance, which she uses to study organic radicals and transition metal ions. Using pulsed EPR it is possible to measure electron spin relaxation, which can help uncover the dynamics of molecules. examined the frequency dependence of electron spin relaxation in fluid solution for several important types of radicals. She has studied the mechanisms of spin and spin-lattice relaxation in rigid lattices and fluid solutions; identifying the role of methyl groups and nuclear spins in spin echo dephasing. Her systematic studies in both glassy solvents and fluid solutions can be used to establish the relationship between structure and relaxation. Eaton developed spectral-spatial imaging using EPR, as well as the analysis software to accompany it. She wrote "EPR Imaging and in Vivo EPR" in 1991.
Eaton has published several books about electron paramagnetic resonance and how to quantitatively produce the same results between labs. In 1998, Eaton published "Foundations of Modern EPR". "Distance measurents in Biological Systems by EPR" was published in 2000. She published "Biomedical EPR - Part A: Free Radicals, Metals, Medicine and Physiology" and "Part B: Methodology, Instrumentation, and Dynamics" in 2004. In 2010 she published "Quantitative EPR".
In 2016 she collaborated with a biotechnology company to develop commercial imaging equipment. She demonstrated a way to measure oxygen in the body in realtime, which can provide similar information to MRI. At the Knoebel Institute for Healthy Aging they are developing these techniques to monitor disease therapies "in situ".
She has been principal investigator on several large NSF grants. She and her husband Gareth Eaton have a book fund at Harvard Library for chemistry students. She was appointed a Fellow of the Electron Paramagnetic Society in 2008. She has published extensively in peer-reviewed journals, has a H-index of over 50 and an I10-index of 239.

Honestiores and humiliores

Honestiores" and "humiliores are two categories of the population of Ancient Rome, roughly high and low castes. The division first appeared in the end of the 2nd century A.D. The first category consisted of senators, equites, decuriones and some other social classes, the second of all other people. "Honestiores" had many privileges: they could not be tortured and would be killed by beheading and not damnatio ad bestias or crucifixion.

Apollo Tower

Apollo Tower is a residential high-rise in Ampelokipoi, Athens. It is the tallest residential building in Greece, standing at 80 m (≈262,5 ft). It has 25 floors.
History.
During the reign of the Greek Military Junta, the height limit for buildings was abolished, thus giving room for much taller buildings to be built. So in 1973, Apollo Tower was able to be built. Thanks to having been built with generators, during a powerful earthquake of 1981 that happened in Athens, Apollo Tower was one of the only buildings that stayed intact and even had power. The same happened during the deadly 1999 earthquake. The Building back then had a bar on the rooftop with a pool. Today the bar is closed and the pool is empty. Also, Today many of the apartments made for living are now used as offices and clinics. In fact, residents often joke about having a domiciliary hospital.
On August 9, 2013, a Man, later found to be called Basilis Theodorou (Βασίλης Θεοδώρου), recorded and uploaded footage on Youtube of him BASE jumping off the 25th floor. The video garnered over 5.000 views and some media attention from local outlets in Greece.

Now Apocalypse

Now Apocalypse is an American comedy television series that aired for one season of ten episodes from March 10 to May 12, 2019, on Starz. The series was written by Gregg Araki and Karley Sciortino. Araki also was director and executive producer alongside Steven Soderbergh and Gregory Jacobs. Starz canceled the series on July 26, 2019.
Premise.
Ulysses, his friends Carly and Ford, and Ford's girlfriend Severine navigate love, sex, and fame in Los Angeles. Troubled by sinister, premonitory dreams, Ulysses wonders if the end of the world as we know it is coming, or if he is simply suffering some kind of marijuana-fueled delusions.
Production.
Development.
Gregg Araki was inspired to do television by the mystery series "Twin Peaks", which he called "so ground-breaking and artistic and unusual and just its totally own thing". He directed episodes of several television series, but was hesitant to run his own show until he thought about the story potential of life in Los Angeles. Araki presented the idea to writer Karley Sciortino, who started working with him on the script. Gregory Jacobs, who had worked with Araki on "Red Oaks", joined the project and brought in Steven Soderbergh. The production designer, costume designer, and director of photography have previously worked on other projects with Araki.
On March 26, 2018, it was announced that Starz had given "Now Apocalypse" a series order for a first season of ten episodes. The series is written by Araki and Sciortino, and directed by Araki. The series is executive produced by Soderbergh, Jacobs, and Araki. On December 10, 2018, it was announced that the series would premiere on March 10, 2019. On March 22, 2019, the eight remaining episodes of season one were released online and on demand. They also continued to air weekly.
Starz canceled the series on July 26, 2019. Araki later stated that he was shopping the series to other networks.
Casting.
In June 2018, it was announced that Avan Jogia, Kelli Berglund, Beau Mirchoff, and Roxane Mesquida had joined the main cast and that Evan Hart, Taylor Hart, Tyler Posey, Jacob Artist, Chris Aquilino, Desmond Chiam, RJ Mitte, and Grace Victoria Cox had been cast in recurring roles. On July 2, 2018, it was reported that Kevin Daniels and Avra Friedman had joined the cast in a recurring capacity.
Filming.
The ten episodes of the series were shot in 40 days.
Reception.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes the series holds an approval rating of 78% based on 32 reviews, with an average score of 6.42 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Marrying filmmaker Gregg Araki's frisky style with heady conspiracies and literary allusions, "Now Apocalypse"s bodacious aesthetics and philosophical pondering may prove too deliberately offbeat and garish for some." Metacritic assigned the series a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

Anti-Islamophobia activism.
Sheikha Hend Al Qasimi condemned Indian Hindus living in the UAE posting hate messages against Islam on Twitter. Islamophobic social media posts were targeting Muslims over a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi that led to an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases in India. Al Qasimi shared screenshots of the Islamophoic tweets and warned that racism and discrimination in the UAE will not be tolerated and expatriates who are Islamophobic will be made to leave the country, declaring that there is no room for religious intolerance in the UAE.
Speaking to news outlets, she stated "I have never heard an Indian attack an Arab or a Muslim before but now I have reported just one person but you can see my timeline is full of people insulting the Arabs, Muslims. This is so un-Indian." The Indian ambassador to the UAE Navdeep Suri reiterated her message and told her that her message has gone out "loud and clear".
The princess is also a vocal supporter for persecuted Uyghurs Muslims in China. In an April 2020 interview, she spoke out against the Xinjiang re-education camps and in support of persecuted Uyghurs.

Southwestern family of companies

Southwestern is a diversified, international, employee-owned family of companies.
History.
In 1855, Southwestern Publishing House was established in Nashville, Tennessee. The company's name was chosen because, at that time, Nashville was in the southwestern part of the United States. Founded by the Baptist minister James Robinson Graves, Southwestern originally published "The Tennessee Baptist", a Southern Baptist newspaper, and religious booklets which were sold by mail for 20¢ and 30¢ each.
Prior to the Civil War, most bibles were printed in the North, rather than the South. Graves acquired stereotype plates from the North and began printing bibles for sale in August 1861. He also produced and sold educational books. After the 1864 Battle of Nashville resulted in a Union victory, Graves relocated to Memphis, as he felt vulnerable because of articles he had published against the North. The company resumed publishing in 1867.
In 1868, Graves discontinued the company’s mail order business, and began training young men as independent dealers to sell bibles and educational books door-to-door as a way to earn money for college. Graves retired in 1871.
In 1879 the company relocated to Nashville under the new ownership of Jacob Florida. In 1899, P. B. Jones, acquired majority ownership and became President and General Manager. In 1921, J. B. Henderson, a sixteen-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became the sole owner. During the 1920s, the firm grew to one of the largest person-to-person sales companies in America.
By 1947, Southwestern had lost nearly all of its independent dealers as a result of World War II. It was rebuilt,and experienced tremendous growth as the United States rebounded from the Great Depression. The number of independent reps grew to over 1,500.
In 1959 Oldham, a 24-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became the majority shareholder of Southwestern; his ownership role that would last until 1968 and his presidential role that would last until 1972. J. Fred Landers was also made 49% owner at this time and continued his career with Southwestern until his death in 1987. The Southwestern Family of Companies headquarters is named after Fred for his deep contributions to the culture of the company. Dedicated by Spencer Hays in 1989.
In 1968, Times-Mirror Company acquired ownership of Southwestern.
In 1972, Spencer Hays, a fourteen-year veteran who started in the summer sales program, became president.
In 1975, Times-Mirror formed a fund-raising company called Nashville Educational Marketing Services under Southwestern, later to be renamed Great American Opportunities. Jerry Heffel became the company's president in 1980. In 1982, executives of the firm purchased Southwestern and sister-company Great American Opportunities by leveraged buyout from Times-Mirror, forming Southwestern/Great American, Hays was named executive chairman of the board and Ralph Mosley was named chairman and CEO.
Southwestern earned position 4,832 on the Inc. 5000 list in 2012 of the fastest growing private companies in the United States.
Subsidiaries.
After the leveraged buyout in 1982 from Times-Mirror that formed Southwestern/Great American, the family of companies continued to expand. Their services now include consulting, fundraising, financial services, real estate, and executive search.
Southwestern Advantage.
Since 1868, Southwestern Advantage has operated a direct marketing sales program that recruits and trains college and university students as independent contractors. The company recruits a few thousand American and a few hundred European university students to sell educational books, software, apps, and subscription websites during the summer.
Other enterprises.
Great American Opportunities is a school fundraising company where students can participate in magazine fundraisers and the like. In 2012, the firm acquired the assets of QSP, making it the largest school fundraising company in North America. In January 2019 Great American Opportunities realized it was bleeding, losing millions of dollars over Q4 of 2018. Henry Bedford and Dustin Hillis “restructured” the company selling off all products and distribution channels, firing entire salesforce, immediately ceasing all benefits and pay and only offering the donation platform and magazine line to the new 1099 based salesforce that remained. This is now called “Southwestern Fundraising” 
Southwestern Publishing Group was acquired as Favorite Recipes Press in 1982 from Fuller and Dees as a custom book publisher focused on cookbooks to be sold for fundraising purposes. Since that time, over 1,500 titles have been published. In 2011, it was renamed Southwestern Publishing Group
Thinking Ahead, an executive search company recruits and places candidates from small businesses to Fortune 100 companies, was established in 1982 as Southwestern Business Resources (SBR), with operating offices in Nashville, TN and Wilmington, NC, In 2012, it was renamed to ThinkingAhead Executive Search.
SBR Consulting, Established in 2002 by Lars Tewes is a firm specializing in long term sales strategy and implementation of sales programs with operating offices in the United States, United Kingdom, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, and Singapore.
Southwestern Investment Group, (a Raymond James Financial affiliate) was founded in 2002. The company operates as a full-service investment and financial services firm. It is the largest independent branch in the Raymond James network. The firm passed $1 billion in managed assets in its first ten years, and passed the $2 billion mark three years later.

HMS Londonderry (U76)

HMS "Londonderry" was a sloop of the Royal Navy. Built at Devonport Dockyard in the 1930s, "Londonderry" was launched in early 1935 and commissioned later that year. She served in the Red Sea and the South Atlantic until the outbreak of the Second World War. "Londonderry" served as a convoy escort during the war, which she survived. The ship was sold for scrap in 1948.
Construction and design.
HMS "Londonderry" was one of two s constructed under the 1933 construction for the Royal Navy. She was ordered from Devonport Dockyard on 1 March 1934. Two "Grimsby"-class sloops had been ordered under each of the 1931 and 1932 programmes, and two more would be ordered in the programme for next year, giving a total of eight "Grimsby"-class ships built for the Royal Navy. Four more were built for Australia and one for India. The "Grimsby" class, while based on the previous , was intended to be a more capable escort vessel than previous sloops, and carried a more powerful armament.
"Londonderry" was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of at deep load. Displacement was standard, and full load. The ship was powered by two geared steam turbines driving two shafts, fed by two Admiralty 3-drum boilers. This machinery produced and could propel the ship to a speed of . The ship had a range of at .
Two 4.7 in (120 mm) Mark IX guns were mounted fore and aft on the ship's centreline. As the 4.7 inch guns were low-angle guns, not suited to anti-aircraft use, a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft gun was mounted in "B" position. Four 3-pounder saluting guns and eight machine guns completed the ship's gun armament. The initial anti-submarine armament was small, with a design loadout of four depth charges. The ship could be fitted for minesweeping or minelaying (for which the aft 4.7 inch gun was removed, allowing 40 mines to be loaded) as well as escort duties. The ship had a crew of 103 officers and men.
"Londonderry" was laid down on 11 June 1934 and was launched on 16 January 1935. She was formally commissioned on 17 September 1935 with construction completing on 20 September that year.
Modifications.
"Londonderry" underwent a major refit in 1939, which replaced the 4.7-inch and 3-inch guns with 2 twin QF 4 inch (102 mm) Mk XVI anti-aircraft guns. Anti-aircraft armament increased by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon throughout the war, with the close-in anti-aircraft outfit reaching six Oerlikons by 1943. Anti-submarine armament gradually increased throughout the ship's career. The number of depth charges carried increased first to 40, matching that carried by the last two ships of the "Grimsby"-class, and later to 60. A Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar was fitted in 1943 while the ship was being repaired after her stern was blown off.
Type 286 radar was fitted during 1941, later supplemented by Type 271 and Type 291, while HF/DF radio direction-finding gear was also fitted.
Service.
On commissioning, "Londonderry" sailed to her station as part of the Red Sea division, her presence on station being made more urgent by the ongoing Abyssinia Crisis caused by the threat of war between Italy and Ethiopia. She remained based in the Red Sea until 1938, interrupted by regular maintenance periods at Malta. In April 1938 "Londonderry" left the Red Sea and was refitted at Simonstown naval base in South Africa before joining the South Atlantic Station in June 1938. The ship underwent a major refit at Simonstown from February to July 1939, being fitted with a more capable anti-aircraft armament, with dual-purpose 4-inch guns replacing the low-angle 4.7-inch guns previously fitted.
The outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 saw "Londonderry" initially used for local patrols in South African waters, before deploying north to Freetown, Sierra Leone in October that year, carrying out minesweeping and local escort duties. On 24 November 1939 she left West Africa for British waters, arriving at Devonport on 12 December when she underwent a brief refit. On completing the refit, she joined the Rosyth Escort Force, providing anti-aircraft escort for convoys running along Britain's East coast. On 14 February 1940 "Londonderry" was part of the escort of Convoy FS.96, bound for Southend, when a submarine was detected and attacked by "Londonderry" and the destroyer . On 11 November 1940, "Londonderry", along with the destroyer , formed the escort for Convoy FN332, from Southend to Methil, when the convoy came under attack from German bombers. Both "Londonderry" and "Vivien" claimed one bomber shot down, while the tug "St. Mellons" claimed a German fighter.
In December 1940, "Londonderry" was transferred to Western Approaches Command, operating out of Liverpool as part of 1st Anti-Aircraft Division, serving as a convoy escort in the Western Approaches. She transferred to Newfoundland in June 1941, based at St John's. Service in the Western Atlantic was brief, however, and "Londonderry" crossed the Atlantic in July, joining the Sloop Division at her namesake port of Londonderry, and operating as part of the 42nd Escort Group.
In December 1941 "Londonderry" joined 40th Escort Group escorting convoys to Freetown. On 31 January 1942, the 40th Escort Group, including "Londonderry" was escorting Convoy SL 98 when the convoy was attacked by the German submarine "U-105", which torpedoed and sank the sloop . "Londonderry" picked up 13 survivors from "Culver", with the remaining 127 of "Culver"s crew killed. From April to June 1942 "Londonderry" was refitted at Avonmouth. She then rejoined 40th Escort Group. On 14 July 1942 "Londonderry" was part of the escort for Convoy SL115 when the sloop detected nearby radio signals using her HF/DF gear, and on investigating the signal, discovered the German submarine and the Italian submarine "Pietro Calvi" on the surface, which both promptly dived. "Lulworth" depth charged "Pietro Calvi", forcing the Italian submarine to the surface, where she was badly damaged by gunfire and ramming. "Londonderry" went to the assistance of "Lulworth", which boarded the Italian submarine. The boarding attempt was aborted when "U-130" attempted to torpedo "Lulworth", which responded with depth charges, which drove off the German submarine, but also hastened "Pietro Calvi"s sinking. 35 of the 78-man crew of "Calvi" was rescued by the British ships.
From October 1942 to January 1943 "Londonderry" was employed escorting convoys to North Africa following Operation Torch, the Anglo-American invasion of French North Africa. On 3 February 1943, "Londonderry" part of the escort for Convoy HX224, was attacking a suspected submarine contact when she was badly damaged by an underwater explosion, possibly due to premature detonation of her depth charges. Four of her crew were killed. Her stern was badly damaged and broke off when the ship was under tow. The ship underwent temporary repairs at Londonderry, then on 12 March was towed to Devonport for permanent repairs, which lasted until November that year.
After the repairs were completed, "Londonderry" joined the 39th Escort Group, escorting convoys between Britain and Gibraltar. On 5 February 1944 she collided with the trawler "Cape Argona" but received little damage. In May 1944 "Londonderry" joined the 41st Escort Group, based at Devonport, escorting shipping in the English Channel in preparation for the upcoming invasion of France. During Operation Neptune, the landings in France, "Londonderry" acted as an escort and as a command ship for landing craft. Once landings were complete, she returned to escort operations in the Channel.
"Londonderry" left operational service after VE day and was laid up in reserve at Milford Haven in May 1945. She was transferred to BISCO for scrapping on 8 March 1948 and was scrapped by E Rees at Llanelly from 8 June 1948.

Roscam

Roscam is a medieval ecclesiastical site and National Monument located in County Galway, Ireland.
Location.
Roscam is located east of Galway city, immediately north of Oranmore Bay.
History.
Roscam stands on the site of a very early (5th century) monastery, with legend linking it to Saint Patrick. It was also associated with Odran, a brother of Ciarán of Clonmacnoise (6th century). The 6th-century Saint Aedus (Aidus) transferred the bones of Brión mac Echach Muigmedóin to Roscam. It was attacked by Vikings in AD 807.
The round tower is dated to the 11th century and appears to have never been completed. The ruined tower once marked the limit of O'Halloran (Ó hAllmhuráin, Clann Fhearghaile) territory.
The church was built in the 15th century.
Roscam is said to have been used as a duelling site in the medieval era; it is well outside Galway city and is easily accessible by boat. 
Ruins and monuments.
There is a limestone round tower ( tall), bullauns and a church in length. The whole site is surrounded by a large enclosure.

Lemma Senbet Fund

The Lemma Senbet Fund is a student managed investments fund offered as a limited-enrollment year-round experiential learning course to top tier undergraduate students from the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland (UMD).
Founding.
The fund, named for Lemma Wolde Senbet, the William E. Mayer Chair Professor of Finance at the Smith School of the University of Maryland, was founded in 2006 with initial capital of US$50,000 from the school's endowment fund.
Governance structure.
The investment management team consists of 12 undergraduate students chosen through an interview and presentation process designed to simulate the hiring process of investment banking firms. The team consists of 2 portfolio managers and 10 equity analysts each dedicated to a specific industry sector: consumer products (discretionary), consumer products (staples), energy, financial services, healthcare, industrials, information technology, materials, telecommunications, and utilities. Each sector analyst pitches approximately 4 stocks per year, and must persuade all 12 members (not just a majority) of the investment team to buy. The student investment management team uses Bloomberg Professional Services running on Bloomberg Terminals to conduct in-depth financial analysis, manage the asset portfolio, and execute security trades. The students are unpaid, and do not share in the fund gains nor receive distributions.
Investment strategy.
The long-term performance goal of the Lemma Senbet Fund is to outpace appreciation of the S&amp;P 500 Index on a risk-adjusted basis. Historically, the fund has adopted a top-down investment approach that is driven by Economic indicators, then Industry trends, and finally individual Company performance (EIC). Most asset instruments are long equity positions. Specific stock selections are based on a combination of fundamental analysis and technical analysis valuation techniques under the Growth at a Reasonable Price (GARP) model.
Fund growth.
Since founding in 2006, even after annual distributions the Lemma Senbet Fund has grown 18-fold from $50,000 to $911,032 (fiscal year ended March 31, 2017).
Fund Distributions.
The Lemma Senbet fund pays a 5% distribution to the UMD Deans Office each year. In 2017, this distribution amounted to $37,729.

Sidekiq

Sidekiq is an open source job scheduler written in Ruby. It's important to be aware that Sidekiq by default doesn't do scheduling, it only executes jobs. The Enterprise version comes with scheduling out of the box.
Architecture.
Sidekiq uses Redis as an in-memory data structure store and is written in Ruby. It also supports Java clients. It can be used with Resque, another Redis based job scheduler, or more commonly as a standalone product.
Sidekiq reads jobs from a Redis queue, using the First In First Out (FIFO) model, to process jobs. Job processing is asynchronous and allows a web thread serve requests, rather than process heavy tasks.
Reception and use.
Sidekiq is described as “well-known queue processing software”.
It's used by Ruby applications needing to run tasks in the background, and not in the web requests handling time, like Mastodon, Diaspora, GitLab and Discourse. Sidekiq is also used to submit threads to the PHASTER phage search tool.

Ellis Stanley Joseph

Ellis Stanley Joseph (Ellis S. Joseph) was a collector and trader in wildlife in the early part of the 20th century. 
Biography.
Much of what is known of Ellis Joseph's childhood and early adult years comes from three lengthy interviews that he gave to newspapers—the "Barrier Miner" in April 1910, the "Sunday Times" (Perth) in July 1912, and the "Sun" (Sydney) in September 1912.
In the interview for "The Barrier Miner" in April 1910, Ellis Joseph said that he was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India to Welsh parents of Jewish religion. Joseph is a Jewish surname—although not exclusively so and, amongst others, it is a Welsh name—and he was recognised as being Jewish in the U.S. Despite Joseph's own statement on his Welsh ethnicity, it is very likely that he actually was of Indian-Jewish origin but hid that Indian origin due to the then prevailing racial policies in Australia. Evidence supporting this is that his surname 'Joseph' was common in some Indian communities (particularly the Baghdadi Sephardic Jewish community but also the Syriac Christians), he was born at Bombay in India (a city with a significant Jewish population), he was described as having "dark-tanned skin" and his physical appearance in newspaper photographs. By the time that Ellis Joseph was born, many Baghdadi Jews were engaged in colonial commerce, were western-educated, and used English first names or English variants of Jewish first names. 'Ellis' may have been an anglicized version of Elias / Elijah, derived from the Hebrew name Eliyahu.
Ellis Joseph said that the family moved to San Francisco in the United States when he was nine months old. In 1912, he said that he had lived near Van Ness Avenue and attended the Geary-street Public School. An obituary—published in the U.S. after his death in 1938—stated that he was educated at an English school in Shanghai.
Joseph gave this account of how he left home in the 1912 newspaper interview. 
This 1912 account is similar to an earlier one given in 1910.
In adulthood, Ellis Joseph was a physically large man—six feet six inches (1.98 m) tall and 21 stone (294 lb or 134 kg) in weight—who was renowned for his seemingly boundless energy. For most of his adult life, he made his living by the import, export and sale of living creatures, capturing many of them himself on expeditions.
There is no doubt of his genuine enthusiasm for wildlife of all kinds. In an interview he stated, reportedly with a sigh, "If I were a wealthy man, I'd have people collecting animals, for my zoo, instead of me collecting for other people's zoos." He had a real gift for relating to and training animals but he was unsentimental about selling even pet animals, and he made large sums of money by trading in wildlife. By the standards of today, his methods of capturing and handling of living creatures would be seen as causing unacceptable suffering, too high an environmental impact, and an excessive death rate.
From some time prior to 1901 up to 1923, he lived in Australia, when not travelling which he frequently did. His travel during these years took him to North America, South America, India, West Africa, and South Africa. From November 1918 to 1926, Joseph owned a 17-acre estate called 'Highfield Hall', which was located in what was then part of Granville but is now within the suburb of Guildford in Sydney. 'Highfield Hall' became both a private zoo and a temporary home for animals in transit to or from other countries.
No mention has been found of Joseph ever marrying. He returned to the United States in 1923. He suffered bad health in his final years and died on 16 September 1938, of a heart attack aged 66 years old, at his home at 179 Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx.
Wildlife trading.
Early years.
At the age of 13, Joseph discovered that there was money to be made in trading birds. While on a holiday trip with his father to Panama, he bought some green parrots at Central American ports and sold these at a profit when he returned to San Francisco. He left home at 15 and made his living trapping and selling birds on the US West Coast, also making a trip to Corinto, in Nicaragua to obtain birds. After a brief interlude during which he was returned to his home and to school, he once again left home at 17 years of age and traded—by his own account—birds from Mexico to Seattle and Tacoma.
It seems that it was trading in birds from the Americas that brought him to Australia but, during an interview in 1910, he said that he also had held other jobs during those early years, including as a fireman in Melbourne (1901) and a railway yard foreman in Auckland, New Zealand. Once familiar with his new environment, he began exporting Australian birds to Europe.
By 1904, Ellis Joseph appears to have based himself in the Western Australian Goldfields Region. In December 1904, he was in Boulder near Kalgoorlie in Western Australia selling caged birds, when one cage containing two 'Californian parakeets' was stolen from him. In September 1906, 'Ellis Josephs' was operating 'a newly-opened bird shop' in Maritana Street Kalgoorlie, was charged with 'cruelly treating a large number of birds by over-crowding them into cages', and fined £1 with 2s costs. In his defence, he stated that the birds had been shipped from Durban in the same cages, and had been inspected upon arrival in port by the 'Chief Stock Inspector and the manager of the Zoological Gardens'.
The experience with the law may have influenced Ellis Joseph to leave Western Australia. In an advertisement for his Kalgoorlie bird shop on 14 September 1906, he announced that "I am leaving for the Eastern States" (of Australia). Hundreds of birds and other items were sold at auction in Perth on 25 September 1906 in preparation for his move.
It is likely that, while in Western Australia, Ellis Joseph had made the acquaintance of Ernest Albert Le Souef (first director of the Perth Zoo from 1898 to 1935). He then began making larger scale expeditions and trading in larger animals.
Early expeditions to capture wildlife.
Ellis Joseph's first venture into the 'big game' animal market was in India, as he stated in a lengthy interview as reported by the "Barrier Miner" newspaper in April 1910,
"I embarked on the British India liner "Mombassa" at London for East India, and landed at Bombay. From there I travelled on to Poona, and thence onward to Surat. On arrival at Surat I bought two tigers, and caught two leopards, three spotted deer, and a large number of birds, including vultures. These I took to Europe, and eventually disposed of the lot at Marseilles."
By 1908, his attention turned to Africa, and he stated in the "Barrier Miner" interview that he had worked there alongside a big game hunter of the time.
"My next journey was to Africa. I landed at Durban, and went to Bulawayo in company with a man named Van Ruyen, who at the present time is the greatest hunter in Africa, next to Sleus, the man who accompanied ex-president Roosevelt on his hunting tour. At Bulawayo we captured four lions, a number of elands, antelopes, water and spring bocks, sable antetopes, crown cranes, secretary birds, and a large number of other species. These were also taken to Europe, and I disposed of the lot to Carl Hagenback [sic], the great Hamburg animal trainer and dealer."
Joseph's companion on this expedition—the hunter reported as 'Van Ruyen'—almost certainly, was Cornelis van Rooyen, big game hunter and first breeder of the Rhodesian Ridgeback (previously known as 'Van Rooyen's lion dog'). The hunter reported as 'Sleus' is almost certainly the famous big game hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, who was a friend of Cornelis van Rooyen, and who accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on the Smithsonian–Roosevelt African Expedition in 1909.
In April 1908, about 80-miles away from Bulawayo, Joseph was injured on the forearm by a lioness that he had captured during this expedition.
In May 1909, Ellis Joseph was in Brisbane exhibiting two chimpanzees that had been trained to perform tricks, and when he gave his long interview to the Barrier Miner in April 1910, was at Broken Hill with just one trained chipanzee called 'Casey'. The second chimpanzee 'Baldy' had died in Queensland in May 1909 and its body had been sold by Joseph to a Brisbane museum for use as an exhibit. In May 1910, 'Casey' was performing tricks in Adelaide, in August of the same year in Kalgoorlie, and in November in Hobart.
It seems that, between his 1908 and 1911-1912 expeditions outside Australia, he made a living exhibiting the chimpanzees while travelling in Australia and, very likely, capturing or buying Australian animals and birds for export as he went along.
In a newspaper interview, in May 1910, he explained that, before he could obtain two hippos for Melbourne Zoo, he would need to sell 'Casey' his trained chimpanzee, which he apparently did to a Mr. Thomas Fox. ('Casey' escaped in December 1914 and was shot in the foot by police in Marrickville, Sydney, after allegedly frightening a woman to death. Mr. Fox lost an eye in the same incident and, after being fined £2 and paying £300 in compensation to the dead woman's estate, he took 'Casey' to the U.S.A. Casey died at Tampa, Florida in January 1917.)
During the long interview of April 1910, Ellis Joseph stated that he had supplied animals to the Adelaide, Melbourne. Perth, and Sydney Zoos, zoos in Europe and America, and the Pretoria Zoo in South Africa. He also stated that he had made an expedition to Argentina to capture wildlife including pumas, as well as several expeditions to Africa.
By late 1911, he was making another expedition to West Africa to collect specimens, some of which he sold to the Perth Zoo upon his return in 1912, and was shipping significant numbers of birds and animals.
Once the connection with zoos had been made, Joseph had customers ready to take creatures he captured and his reputation as a major dealer in wildlife grew. The outbreak of World War I and Germany's subsequent loss of her overseas colonies, together with the death of Carl Hargenbeck in 1913, created an opportunity for Joseph, as Germany's hitherto dominant position in the trading of animals for zoos became vacant.
By 1913, Eliis Joseph was in Sydney and had a 'vivariaum' at Moore Park, the location of the Zoological Gardens at that time. In that year, he met Harry Burrell and began to take a keen interest in Burrell's attempts to exhibit platypuses at zoos.
Capturing larger animals.
Joseph was interested mainly in capturing live animals for profit, not in hunting big game or collecting dead specimens for museums. But in trying to capture young animals alive, the deaths of older wild animals and animals used as bait did occur. Captured animals also often died; getting the captured animals to eat was seen by Joseph as a major challenge. In the April 1910 interview, he outlined the problem with larger animals such as chimpanzees, as follows.
"The next thing is to get them to eat after they are placed in captivity. You certainly, do succeed at times, but in most cases the animals sulk or die. The same trouble is experienced with the gorilla, a full size specimen of which has not been possible to rear. Even after years of captivity the gorilla becomes savage, sulks, and dies."
In the April 1910 interview, he described three of the methods he used to capture African animals.
"The best and most effective method I have found to be is the building of a trap, something like a large room, with a picket partition. This would have a door in the front, which would be self-acting, and close down by means of a spring, being released by the weight and vibration caused by the rustling movement of the beast. In this cage or room would be placed a donkey, which is used as a bait. Lions are fond of donkey flesh, and prefer it to the flesh of horses or bullocks."
"The best time to catch the hippopotamus is on moonlight nights and in the dry season. As is well known, the hippo, is an amphibious animal, and when the moon is clear and bright it comes out of the creeks to graze. The hunter has then to discover the favorite spot or breeding places of the beast, and, having done that, build a barricade there. The next move is to get at a point about a mile away, and erect another barricade, and the hippo is thus enclosed in a kind of pound. The express rifle is next brought into use to shoot the old hippos, and the securing of the young animals is then a comparatively easy matter. The full-grown ones are too ferocious and too weighty to handle, weighing from two to four tons each."
"Where the casava grows is to be found a creeper called by the natives ti-ti. The stem of this creeper is about the thickness of an ordinary penholder with the strength and pliabilty of wire. Of this creeper the chimpanzee takes no notice, and thus an almost natural trap is made for him. The natives plait the stems of the ti-ti and make snares. Having completed the snares, 'boys' are placed a few hundred yards away with nets and lassoos. In due time the 'chimp.' comes along and digs for the [casava] root. lt gets caught in the snare, and begins to make a noise. Action has to be at once taken to secure the animal, otherwise it will either liberate itself or its fellow 'chimps.' will do so. The lassoo, which is a double-ended one, is thrown, the chimpanzee is caught in the centre of it, and eventually it is placed safely in a box waiting for its reception, where it is freed."
In an interview with "The Sun" in September 1912, he disclosed a fourth method.
"In many cases a favorite watering place of the animals was charged with bromide or cyanide of potassium, which had the effect of stupefying the beasts. Then, of course, they were easy to handle and stored away."
By the standards of today, these methods cause unacceptable suffering, too high an environmental impact, and an excessive death rate.
Association with Le Souef family and zoos.
Joseph formed an association with three Australian zoo directors, the brothers Ernest Albert Le Souef (first director of the Perth Zoo from 1898 to 1935), Albert Sherbourne Le Souef (secretary of the Zoological Gardens at Moore Park, Sydney, up to 1916 and then first director of Taronga Park Zoo, from 1916 to 1939) and William Henry Dudley Le Souef (an ornithologist and second director of Melbourne Zoo from 1902 to 1923). Their father was Albert Alexander Cochrane Le Souef, who until his death in 1902 was—like his sons—a zoologist and was involved in the establishment of the Perth Zoo and the Melbourne Zoo, of which he was its first director.
Some saw Ellis Joseph's association with the Le Souef family and the Australian zoos as both unduly advantaging Ellis Joseph over other exporters of Australian wildlife and allowing the zoos themselves to profit, from a large-scale export of Australian animals and birds, against the intent of statutes governing such exports.
Leading the demands for greater transparency were the "Daily Telegraph" and the Wild Life Preservation Society. In 1922, as a result of their efforts, it became known publicly that Ellis Joseph had earlier entered into an exclusive arrangement for a period of five-years, under which he was to receive a half-share of profits from sales (net of transport and other costs) but was guaranteed a minimum of £1000 per annum. Around this time, Ellis Joseph had a falling out with the Le Soueth brothers, losing access to their influence.
Deliveries to Australian zoos.
The scale of Ellis Joseph's operations is apparent from the large shipments he made to Australia during the period from 1912 to 1921. Some of the animals were sold to Australian zoos and some—after November 1918—would be kept at Joseph's estate "Highfield Hall" unless sold or while awaiting trans-shipment to zoos in the U.S.A or other countries.
1912 shipment.
By November 1911, Eliis Joseph was in West Africa. He advised from Sierra Leone that he was going to leave 'Koko Beach' in the south of Nigeria in search of more animals, having already captured some at that time.
Ellis Joseph arrived in Perth on 22 June 1912 with a collection of animals mainly from West Africa. He had failed to obtain rhinocerous for the Perth Zoo. He described what he had found as follows: What was reported as a 'mermaid' was an African manatee that later died while being transported to England. Several of the animals in this 1912 shipment were purchased by Perth Zoo.
Ellis Joseph was selling grey parrots from the 1912 shipment to the public, advertising in Perth and Kalgoorlie. In 1913, he was exporting birds to Vancouver.
1914 shipments.
In March 1914, Ellis Joseph brought a cargo of animals to Sydney on the RMS "Niagara" from Vancouver, Canada. The shipment was reported as follows
"Bulking largest are two magnificent bull bison, captured in Montana; and next in size are two elk, the latter pair and some of the other animals being for the Sydney Zoological Gardens."
"The other inhabitants of this floating menagerie ... are 14 bears black, brown, and cinnamon - several deer, eight peccary (Mexican wild boar), flve coyotes (prairie wolves), three beavers, several minx, a number of squirrels, raccoons, porcupines, lynx, four badgers, and a leopard cat. Among the birds are four American baldheaded eagles, Canadian "honker" goose, blue jays, snow birds, and variegated thrushes. There are also a number of snakes. The whole collection is native of either the States or Canada, and took over four months to got together. They are destined for various Zoological Gardens."
In March 1914, Joseph sold one of the bull bison and some of the other animals to the Adelaide Zoo. The bison had been in a crate, in which it could not turn, for four months and so had marks on its skin.
In late December 1914, Ellis Joseph had another cargo of animals on board "ss Nordic" en route from Durban to the eastern states of Australia. There was a rhinoceros on board and Ellis stated that this was only the fourth one to be captured alive, There were also two African elephants and many other animals on board. The inventory was described as follows.
"a brown hyena, two lions, four leopards, two zebras, two South American llamas, Moufflons, Barbary sheep, blesbok, springbok, ducker bok, impalla, and sable antelopes, jackals, lemurs, two South African elephants, a Livingstone eland, Patagonian hares, a rhinoceros, 40 apes and baboons of different kinds, an Aldebarra tortoise from the Seychelles Islands, pythons and birds of all descriptions."
Some of these animals were destined for the Melbourne Zoo.
In August 1915, Ellis Joseph assisted a fundraising day in Sydney by providing the use of one of the African elephants, a four to five year old 'baby' elephant called 'African Daisy'. Joseph said that he had captured the elephant in Southern Rhodesia in October 1914 and had trained it for a fortnight for the fundraising activity. During the fundraising, the baby elephant was ridden by a little girl. It was reported that the zoos in Australia could not pay him enough for this 'baby' elephant and Joseph sent it to Honolulu.
1916 shipment.
In 1916, Eliis Joseph brought three young polar bears—one male and two female—from New York for the Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney. The cost was £450. By 1919, the zoo was planning to attempt to breed bear cubs from these bears.
The content of the shipment was reported as follows.
"The most interesting animal of the consignment is a monster grizzly bear, which was captured after a hard fight in his Rocky Mountain home. This animal is destined for the new bear pit at Taronga Park. The other animals include three polar bears, two grizzly bears, a todiac [sic] bear, two Mongolian wild horses, monkeys, beavers, raccoons, 14 elks, and black and cinnamon bears. There are also a number of parrots, buzzards, Virginian wild turkeys; white cross pigeons, alligators, and various varieties of snakes."
One of the snakes was a boa-constrictor. Two elks and a bison died during the voyage.
Ellis Joseph hoped to dispose of the wildlife to the Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney and to the Adelaide Zoo.
1921 shipment.
In 1921, Ellis Joseph was a passenger on the first part of the last voyage of the "SS Canastota". After the ship left New York and passed through the Panama Canal, it called first at Suva, Fiji, where numerous birds, animals and reptiles were transferred to the A.U.S.N. Co. steamer "Levuka" (bound for Sydney), along with Mr Joseph. The transfer between ships was made so as to reduce the time it would take to deliver the live cargo to Sydney.
The wildlife in the shipment were as follows.
"8 bears (polar and grizzly), 3 buffaloes, 14 racoons, 2 wolves, 8 foxes, 50 monkeys. 2 mountain lions, 5 skunks, 100 snakes, 100 parrots, 100 finches, 2 llamas, 20 white swans, 7 possums, 40 alligators, 21 tortoises.2 gilla monsters, 1 woolley monkey".
A hyena and a llama died during the voyage.
On 18 April 1921, Mr. Joseph and his menagerie reached Sydney safely. The cargo of creatures was divided between Taronga Park Zoo in Sydney and Melbourne Zoo.
On Anzac Day (25 April) 1921, he was reunited - in front of a hundred or so onlookers - with his former pet chipmazee 'Casey', whom he had sold to the Taronga Park Zoo before leaving for America in 1920. (This chimpanzee was the second 'Casey', not the one with whom he had travelled Australia in 1909-1910.) In Casey's excitement to see him again—or so it was reported at the time—'Casey' embraced Joseph but, in doing so, delivered a bite to Joseph's jaw that resulted in a large wound to his cheek and another below his chin. Joseph, who had one arm in a sling at the time, was rescued by a zoo keeper and sent to hospital for treatment. The second 'Casey' lived at the zoo, until his death in January 1936.
Deliveries to American zoos.
1916 &amp; 1917 shipments (thylacine or 'Tasmanian tiger', elephant &amp; 'Hawaiian wallabies').
Joseph played a small part in hastening the extinction of the thylacine or 'Tasmanian tiger', by providing two of the animals to the Bronx Zoo, in New York in 1916 and 1917. The first animal died after only seven days at the zoo, while the second lived until September 1919.
On a visit to the Bronx Zoo, the director of the Melbourne Zoo, Mr. Le Souef, said upon seeing the last animal, "I advise you to take excellent care of that specimen; for when it is gone, you never will get another. The species soon will be extinct". The last known thylacine died at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart in 1936.
In 1916, Joseph delivered a young African elephant to Honolulu's Kapiolani Park Zoo. Named 'Miss Daisy'—almost certainly the same elephant as 'African Daisy' who was used for fundraising in Sydney in 1915—she was at the zoo until March 1933, when she went on a rampage. She killed her keeper George Conradt, got loose, and was then shot dead.
Two brush-tailed rock wallabies sold in 1916 by Ellis Joseph to a developer, for his private zoo, are believed to be the ancestors of the wild population of wallabies in the Kalihi Valley on the Hawaiian island of O'ahu.
1920 shipment.
Using his estate 'Highfield Hall' to accommodate the creatures, Joseph accumulated a consignment of over 4,000 Australian birds, animals and reptiles for the New York Zoo. This live cargo was shipped from Sydney on the steamer "Bellbuckle", which arrived in New York on 29 October 1920. Mr. Joseph accompanied his live cargo as a passenger. (Prior to leaving Sydney, in August 1920, he sold his pet chimpanzee—the second one that he owned called 'Casey'—to the Taronga Park Zoo.)
The shipment included a lung-fish, from the Burnett River in Queensland, for the New York Zoo. This was unusual for Ellis Joseph, who was interested in all animals but did "not deal in fishes, except on his breakfast plate".
Some of the creatures were sent to the US under an agreement between American zoos and Australian zoos, to cooperate by providing specimens endemic to each country, and some belonged to Mr. Joseph himself. The exact role of Ellis Joseph was controversial; he appeared to be both a wildlife dealer and simultaneously acting as an 'agent' for the Australian zoos.
While in New York, Mr. Joseph assembled a shipment of creatures destined for Australian zoos. He left New York, together with his new live cargo, aboard the "ss Canastota" on 6 March 1921.
Koala or 'koala bear'.
Speaking in April 1921, about Ellis Joseph, the master of the ss Canastota (Captain Andrew J. Lockie) said in a newspaper interview.: 
Platypus (1922).
With the assistance of the Australian naturalist and expert on monotremes, Henry Burrell, Ellis Joseph took the first live platypus to be seen outside Australia to the United States in 1922.
Five platypuses were shipped from Sydney on 12 May 1922 to San Francisco, from where they were sent by train to New York, at all times accompanied by Mr. Joseph. Ellis Joseph had been assisted by his local member of the NSW Parliament, Mr A.K. Bowden MLA, to obtain an export permit for the platypuses.The animals were transported in an enclosure designed by Burrell—with some input from Joseph—that was known as a 'portable platypusary'. It consisted of five compartments leading from the water to the sand, and in each of the internal walls there was a narrow, rubber-lined doorway. Joseph explained the secret of the 'portable platypusary', in an interview:
Despite the special enclosure and the great care taken, after the long journey of over fifty days, only one platypus was alive and it survived at the New York Zoological Park for only seven weeks.
Ellis Joseph wrote about the events of the long journey and his efforts—from 1916 onward—to export a platypus, in an article for Bulletin of the New York Zoological Society that was quoted in The Journal (Adelaide) of 7 April 1923. The export of a live platypus was the pinnacle of Joseph's career and he was proud to have achieved it. It remained the event for which he was most renowned, for several decades.
1923 shipments (camels, birds and kangaroos).
In July 1923, Ellis Joseph made a large shipment to the United States using two separate ships.
He bought 55 camels, from a camel depot of the government of South Australia and shipped these to America on the steamer "Eastern". (or "Easterner"). The camels were destined for American zoos. Camels are not native to Australia but were imported as a means of transport in arid areas. By the time of the shipment, such camels were being replaced by motorised transport. Camels still exist in Australia, in large numbers, as feral animals.
Ellis Joseph also sent a shipment of birds and 150 kangaroos to New York on the steamer "Medic". He had been advertising to purchase live kangaroos in June 1923.
1924 shipment.
In September 1924, Ellis Joseph imported several elephants on board the SS "American Trader", which were unloaded at Hoboken.
End of Australian operations.
Opposition to wildlife exports and regulatory changes.
In 1923, although still exporting Australian animals in that year, Ellis Joseph was not allowed to reattempt the export of live platypuses to the United States. Influencing that decision was the fact that three playpuses destined for export had died while in captivity in Australia. After having spent much time and effort since 1916 pursuing this aim, it must have been a great disappointment.
Public and expert opinion was changing in favour of animal welfare and conservation of wildlife in its natural environment, and it is likely that Joseph's reputation had suffered some damage due to the revelations about his contractual arrangements in 1922. He had also had a falling out with the Le Soueth brothers, losing access to their influence.
Changing attitudes and a growing conservation movement led to increased regulation of the wildlife trade in Australia. In 1923, almost at the same time as Joseph's 1923 shipment to the United States, a prohibition was placed by the Minister of Customs on the export certain species from Australia. From that time on, export of such wildlife would be guided by recommendations to the Collector of Customs by an advisory committee in each state of Australia but no export permit would be granted for 'purely commercial reasons'.
For a commercial dealer in rare and exotic animals such as Joseph, the consequences of the new Australian regulatory arrangements were enormous; it effectively would end his ability to export many Australian animals and birds.
Joseph's 1923 shipment included only wildlife that he claimed had been captured prior to the prohibition, that he claimed he had purchased from 'public gardens'—presumably zoos—or from private owners.
It seems that Ellis Joseph's Australian-based wildlife import and export operations ceased after 1923.
Sale of Highfield Hall.
Ellis Joseph's 17.75 acre estate 'Highfield Hall', with its 12-room house and offices, had been his home since November 1918. Its extensive grounds housed his personal menagerie and were used as a holding location for animals prior to their shipment and sale. Highfield Hall probably had a small farm, and it had been used, before it was owned by Ellis Joseph, to run cattle and raise poultry. The estate probably was at least partially self-sufficient in providing food for the animals and birds Ellis Joseph kept there.
In October 1925, an auction was held at 'Highfield Hall' for 'building materials' including a large quantity of hardwood timber, a 60-foot long shed, 170 bird cages, incubators, a brooder and a tip-dray with horse and harness, on the "instructions from Mrs. Moore, who is acting for Mr. Joseph". Mrs Moore was Hannah Moore, who like her husband Arthur Moore was an animal keeper. The pair had looked after the estate during Ellis Joseph's absence.
Ellis Joseph's house and estate, its luxurious furnishings, his possessions - including a "Magnificent collection of valuable Skins" - and his motor car - a 1920 Buick - were put to a second auction on 5 December 1925, "under instructions from and for and on account of Mrs. H.J. Moore, in consequence of her early departure for abroad." The inventory of the auction, which was advertised as "The sale of the season", indicates that Ellis Joseph was by that time a very wealthy man.
By 1926, 'Highfield Hall' had been sold for £6,500, Joseph having been based in the United States from 1923.
Legacy in Australia.
Ellis Joseph's main legacy was the extensive animal collections at the Perth, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide zoos.
A newspaper photograph in the Daily Telegraph of 4 October 1927, suggests that he made a visit to Sydney in that year. The caption read "Kiss and be friends — Ellis Joseph, the animal dealer, "makes up" with his friend Mike the chimpanzee, after slight difference."
"Molly the orangutan", an animal who was said to have been captured by Ellis Joseph in Borneo, and who belonged to the same Mr Thomas Fox of Marrickville who had bought the first 'Casey', toured Australia into the early 1930s. By 1931, Ellis Joseph's Australian home "Highfield Hall" had become a boarding school. The land later was subdivided.
Ellis Joseph was still well known in the 1930s, being remembered mainly as the man who had exported the first live playpus. After that, he faded from memory.
Later years in the US.
After his return to the US, Ellis Joseph lived in New York from 1923 and, from 1927 until his death, in the Bronx, New York, in a neighbourhood not far from the Bronx Zoo.
Live animal trade.
Ellis Joseph appears to have relocated at least some of his Australian menagerie from 'Highfield Hall' in Sydney (sold by 1926) to a location at Conner Street and Hollers Avenue in the Bronx, New York.
In the 1920s, he was trading live animals in the United States. Between 1925 and 1928, he sold four elephants: two to circuses and two to zoos.
He retired in 1933.
Museum gifts.
The president of the American Museum of Natural History noted in his annual report for 1926, that Ellis Joseph had supplied (dead) specimens to the museum.
"The New York Zoological Society and Mr. Ellis S. Joseph continued to supply the Department with important specimens for preservation in its study collections, which have been well used by specialists from the Yale, Johns Hopkins, and Columbia departments of anatomy and neuro-anatomy."
The same annual report included Ellis Stanley Joseph in the list of life members of the museum, and stated that he had provided "by Gift" the following specimens:
For Mammalogy: "1 Anteater, giant; 2 baboons; 1 baboon, hamadrlyas; 1 eyra cat; 1 fishing cat; 3 gazelles; 1 addra gazelle; 1 Semmerring's gazelle; 1 hyaena; 1 spotted hyaena; 1 ibex; 1 leopard; 1 lynx caracal; 1 sheep ".
For Comparative Anatomy: "1 Anteater, giant (Myrmecophaga jubata), South America. 4 Baboons; 2 baboons, hamadryas, Africa; 2 hyeenas, Africa; 1 kangaroo, Australia; 1 llama, young; 1 macaque; 1 mandrill, Africa; 1 mangabey; 2 monkeys, green, Africa; 2 monkeys, green (Erythrocebbus), A f r i c a; 1 monkey, putty - nosed, West Africa; 1 ostrich; 1 pelican, Egyptian."
It is not clear whether these animals were killed to create museum specimens or had already died when gifted to the museum—in earlier years, Ellis Joseph had been known to sell or gift only animals of his that had died to museums—but the number of animals gifted, in just one year, suggests either the slaughtering of at least part of his personal menagerie occurred in 1926 or an exceptional death rate in that year.
Ellis Joseph also gave gifts of specimens to the museum in 1928 and 1930.
Death.
For the last five years of his life, Ellis Joseph suffered poor health.
Ellis Joseph died on 16 September 1938, of a heart attack aged 66 years old, at his home at 179 Mosholu Parkway, the Bronx. So ended an extraordinary and eventful life.

Ta13oo

Ta13oo (stylized TA13OO and pronounced "Taboo") is the third studio album by American rapper Denzel Curry. It was released on July 27, 2018, through PH Recordings and distributed by Loma Vista Recordings. The album serves as the follow-up to Curry's second studio album, "Imperial", released in 2016, and the "13" EP, released in 2017. "Ta13oo" features guest appearances from Twelve'len, GoldLink, Nyyjerya, JID, JPEGMafia, ZillaKami, and additional vocals by Billie Eilish. Production was handled by FnZ, DJ Dahi, Ronny J, Illmind, Charlie Heat, and Mickey de Grand IV, among others.
"Ta13oo" was supported by five singles: "Sumo", "Percs", "Clout Cobain", "Vengeance", and "Black Balloons". The album received widespread acclaim from critics.
Background.
In an interview with Zane Lowe, Denzel Curry described the structure of the album: "I was in a dark space when I was working on the dark part. I was tryna work on the light part when I was working toward my happiness."
A statement accompanying the music video to "Clout Cobain" stated: "Across the three sections of "Ta13oo", Denzel explores topics including molestation, the presidential election, fame, hatred, paranoia, revenge, love, the current state of music and personal tales of his own near-death experiences. Sonically, the album ranges just as widely as its subject matter, sounds of paranoia, fear of loss, brooding melancholy and mood swings straight from hell all find their way onto "Ta13oo"."
Release and promotion.
The first single, "Sumo", was released on March 30, 2018 for streaming and digital download. The second single, "Percs", was released on May 25, 2018. The third single, "Clout Cobain", was released on July 12, 2018, alongside a music video. "Black Balloons" and "Cash Maniac" were made available for digital download as promotional singles on July 23 and 24, 2018.
The album was released as three acts consecutively between July 25 and 27, 2018, with the album released in its totality on July 27, 2018. Subsequently, "Vengeance" was released as a single on September 5, 2018, while "Black Balloons" was promoted on March 27, 2019.
Critical reception.
"Ta13oo" was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 86, based on six reviews.
Marshall Gu of "Pretty Much Amazing" wrote, "Ultimately, easily one of the most simultaneously hardest and atmospheric hip-hop albums of the year". In his review for "HipHopDX", Justin Ivey praised the album, writing, "Curry has constructed a project that plays to the sonic structures of the era without sacrificing meaningful content in doing so. "TA13OO" is the culmination of his promise and talent, resulting in Curry's magnum opus". Sputnikmusic's critic Jordan M. said, "Realistically, "Ta13oo" is extremely satisfying from a consumption standpoint. It's everything I'd want from a rap album this year". Concluding his review for AllMusic, Neil Z. Yeung stated that "With this additional substance and strategic guest contributions, Curry is elevated on "TA13OO" -- despite this deep dive into despair and darkness -- hinting at more insight on future efforts".
In a positive review, Dean Van Nguyen of "Pitchfork" wrote that "It's when he sticks to the highly personal that Curry's music is devoid of all cliché—the power of his performance, the veracity of his pen, and the color of his wordplay make him an expert at voicing the tribulations of this doomed condition we call being young. All of this makes him impossible to place in the broader SoundCloud rap domain. Signs point to an artist who will outlast any single distribution platform—or any of the genres named for them". Trey Alston of "Highsnobiety" gave the album a favorable review, writing, "To call it psychedelic is a cliché, but the album is a multi-part, constantly-moving, collection of harsh emotions with a funky twist that works, even if the final leg slows down the momentum a tad".

Regents of University of California v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County (Rosen)

Regents of University of California v. Superior Court of Los Angeles County, 4 Cal. 5th 607, 413 P.3d 656 (2018), was a case in which the Supreme Court of California held that universities owe a duty to protect students from foreseeable violence during curricular activities. In an opinion by Justice Ming Chin, the Court tossed out the 2010 case in which Katherine Rosen, a former UCLA student, sued the university for negligence when another student stabbed her in a chemistry lab. Following this ruling, Rosen can pursue the case again in court.
The Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, Division Seven initially held that the university's summary judgment motion was wrongly denied in students' action that alleged university breached its duty of care by failing to adopt reasonable measures that would have protected her from another student's violent on-campus attack, as a public university had no general duty to protect its students from criminal acts of other students.

Yaeji (EP)

Yaeji is the debut extended play by South-Korean-American house producer Kathy Yaeji Lee, known by her stage name as Yaeji. Written and produced by Lee and Nick Sylvester, the EP is a lo-fi house record with minimal structures and spoken word lyrics in a combination of Korean and English languages. It was released by the label Godmode on March 31, 2017 and garnered mostly favorable reviews from critics, landing at No. 50 on "Pitchfork"'s list of the "50 Best Albums of 2017."
Production.
"Yaeji" was produced by Lee and Nick Sylvester. The making of each song began with Lee writing the lyrics and coming up with concepts on how the instrumental would be produced in Ableton. She then sent her ideas to Sylvester. As he said in an interview, "Maybe I'll replace certain parts or rearrange them, or I'll send it back to her and be like, 'I think this could be better.'" Once the songs' conception was completed, the two went to Godmode's Los Angeles studio to record their final versions. Sylvester initially wrote the instrumental for "Feel It Out" for Beyoncé, but her creative team did not use it and he created a new arrangement of it for "Yaeji".
Composition.
"Yaeji" is a lo-fi house album characterized by simple structures, prominent three-note bass riffs, two-note chords and intimate yet deadpan vocals. Lee's singing follows a fast inflection and "shifts between a relaxed whisper and endearing spoken word, maintaining a melancholy register throughout," wrote Kevin Lozano of "Pitchfork". Max Pearl of "Resident Advisor" compared Lee's performance to Marie Davidson and Galcher Lustwerk. The lyrics are written in a combination of both Korean and English languages, with the "secretive or private" stuff being sung in Korean. "Yaeji" features both emotionally charged songs, "Noonside" being a commentary on the United States Border Patrol and "New York 93" being about her time as a child in New York City, and regular dance tracks such as "Full of It" and a cover of Australian DJ Mall Grab's "Guap." "Feel It Out" is about the idea that "what is here is what ain't" in other places in the world, and Lee raps on the song, "Other countries, they are having more than coffee."
Promotion.
"New York 93," its video and a remix of the track by Jean St. Jean were released on February 29, 2016. The track was Yaeji's debut song for Godmode, which included it as part of its weekly "Faculty" series where the label uploaded a new song from the imprint to SoundCloud each week. As "Stereogum" summarized, the video "feels like dozens of different memories displaced from time. It’s smooth and sultry, oddly comforting but a bit alienating, in a way that the city it's named after can so often be. Listen below." The track "Noonside" and its music video, which depicts footage of Lee in New York and Seoul, was released on February 27, 2017. On April 4, 2017, "The Fader" premiered the official music video for "Feel It Out." Filmed at Sylvester's apartment in The Bronx, it depicts Lee in a room with objects such as pineapples coming to life around her.
Critical reception.
"XLR8R" summarized "Yaeji" as "a perfect encapsulation of her sound," particularly highlighting the record's "appealing simplicity." Lozano described its more "straightforward" tracks as "earworm[s] through and through," while also noting the use of political and personal songs gave the record "an unexpected emotional texture." Both he and Pearl praised the "pure" and "raw" display of Lee's vocals. Pearl spotlighted the EP's "charming details" in its production, such as the use of vocal harmonies. As Michelle Kim wrote about "Yaeji" as well as Lee's second extended play,
"with each new song, Yaeji sounds more comfortable embracing the binaries that exist within her identity and her music." "Gorilla vs. Bear" placed the EP in the No. 1 spot in its year-end list of best albums, saying, "Similar to the experience of hearing Grimes for the first time, there's an obvious special, one-of-a-kind quality that just radiates from everything she does".

Irish food shortages (1925)

In 1925, the newly independent Irish Free State underwent food shortages. The Irish War of Independence, the Irish Civil War and an economic depression had taken their toll on society, with over 100,000 unemployed in a population of three million.
The Free State government denied that people faced starvation. Speaking in the Dáil, the Minister for Lands and Agriculture Patrick Hogan stated that "There is no abnormal distress in the West this year. I say that definitely and deliberately. There is always distress in the West, but the distress this year is not ... particularly unique...There is never real famine in the West unless there is a failure of potatoes, and there was no failure of potatoes this year."
Hogan's claim was not only at odds with media reports over the previous six months but also with his own colleagues. Heavy rain had caused crop failure and destroyed animal fodder, and the flooding of peat bogs had also deprived people of fuel. The government were accused of covering up the food shortages in order to avoid bad publicity. The Department of Local Government and Public Health insisted in February that there was no famine, merely "acute distress."
In April 1925, an "Irish Times" report described loss of livestock from fluke and other diseases in County Clare, but it refuted reports that people had been living on leaves or making stock out of the meat of animals which had died of disease. Conditions returned to normal with better harvests in 1925 and 1926.
Relief efforts.
The Free State government allocated IR£250,000 in relief funds. An appeal for funds was made in Australia by Linda Kearns in February 1925, raising thousands of Australian pounds. The Workers International Relief (a Communist International adjunct) also organised relief. The Catholics of New York sent US$25,000 in February 1925. In relation to this donation, Archbishop Patrick O'Donnell described conditions as "No famine, but much want in places." An English firm offered to send one ton of chocolate to the children of Connacht, but cancelled their plans when the Irish government insisted on payment of duty on the donation.

Nathaniel White (businessman)

Nathaniel White (February 7, 1811 – October 2, 1880) was an American businessman, social reformer, philanthropist, and politician.
Early years and education.
Nathaniel White, the oldest child of Samuel and Sarah (Freeman) White, was born in Lancaster, New Hampshire, February 7, 1811. His ancestors were among the hardy pioneers who settled New England. William White, the founder of the family in the United States, came from England and landed at Ipswich, Massachusetts, in 1635. The descendants of William were among the earliest settlers of northern New Hampshire. His childhood was passed under his mother's care, and she provided strict religious training.
Career.
At the age of fourteen, he went into the employ of a merchant of Lunenburg, Vermont, with whom he remained about one year, when he accepted employment with Gen. John Wilson, of Lancaster, who was just entering upon his duties as landlord of the Columbian Hotel in Concord, New Hampshire. His parents more readily consented to his taking this step on account of the many noble qualities of Mrs. Wilson. To her care he was entrusted by his own mother. In the employ of Gen. Wilson, White commenced life in Concord in an entry-level position. He arrived in Concord, August 25, 1826, with one shilling in his pocket. For five years, or until he came of age, he continued at the Columbian Hotel, rendering a strict account of his wages to his father, and saving the dimes and quarters which came as perquisites, until by his twenty-first birthday, he had a fund of .
In 1832, he made his first business venture, negotiating the first and last business loan of his life, and purchased a part interest in the stage route between Concord and Hanover, New Hampshire, and occupying the "box" himself for a few years. In one year, he was free from debt. Soon after, he bought into the stage route between Concord and Lowell, Massachusetts. In 1838, in company with Capt. William Walker, he initiated the Pony Express business, making three trips weekly to Boston, and personally attending to the delivery of packages, goods, or money, and other business entrusted to him. In 1842, upon the opening of the Concord Railroad, he was one of the original partners of the express company which was then organized to deliver goods throughout New Hampshire and Canada. The company was successfully operated under various names, and it was indebted to White for its remarkable financial success.
In 1846, White purchased his farm, and cultivated it till his death. It lay in the southwestern section of the city, from the statehouse, and contained over of land. He evinced a strong attachment to Concord, and to him, the city owed much of her material prosperity.
In 1852, he made his first step in political life, being chosen by the Whigs and Free-soilers to represent Concord in the New Hampshire state legislature. He was an abolitionist from the start; a member of the Anti-Slavery society from its inception. His hospitable home was the refuge of many a hunted slave, a veritable station on the under-ground railroad, where welcome, care, food, and money were freely bestowed. The attic of his house and the hay-mows of his stable were resting places for persecuted black men.
In all works of charity and philanthropy, White was foremost or prominent. He was deeply interested in the establishment of the New Hampshire Asylum for the Insane and the State Reform School; in the Orphans' Home, at Franklin, New Hampshire, which he liberally endowed; and the Home for the Aged, in Concord, which was his special care. The Reform Club of Concord, though not an eleemosynary institution, received substantial benefits from his generosity.
Besides his extensive interest in the express company, his farm, —which was one of the most highly cultivated in the state,— his charming summer retreat on the borders of Lake Sunapee, and his real estate in Concord, he was interested in real estate in Chicago, in hotel property in the mountain districts, in railroad corporations, in banks, in manufacturing establishments, and in shipping. He was a director in the Manchester &amp; Lawrence, the Franconia &amp; Profile House, and the Mount Washington railroads, and in the National State Capital Bank. He was a trustee of the Loan and Trust Savings Bank of Concord; also of the Reform School, Home for the Aged, and Orphans' Home, and other private and public trusts.
In 1875, White was candidate for governor, of the Prohibition Party; and he had a vast number of friends in the Republican party, with which he was most closely identified, who wished to secure his nomination for the highest honor within the gift of a state, by the Republican party. In 1876, he was sent as a delegate to the Republican National Convention, which nominated Rutherford B. Hayes for president. During the summer of 1880, he was placed by his party at the head of the list of candidates for presidential electors.
Personal life.
November 1, 1836, he married Armenia S., daughter of John Aldrich, of Boscawen, New Hampshire, who survived him. Their children were John A. White, Armenia E. White, wife of Horatio Hobbs, Lizzie H. White, Nathaniel White, Jr., and Benjamin C. White, who survive. They lost two children, — Annie Frances and Seldon F.; and adopted one, — Hattie S., wife of Dr. D. P. Dearborn, of Brattleboro, Vermont.
In early life, White joined the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He belonged to no other secret society. During the first four years of their married life, on account of his occupation, they boarded. For eight years, they lived on Warren Street. From 1848, until his death, they resided on School Street. White died October 2, 1880, having been stricken down suddenly.

The leaves are alternately set, upright, narrowly oblong to oblong-elliptic, 4½–6½ cm (1.8–2.6 in) long and wide, set on a leaf stalk of up to ½ cm (0.2 in) long. Near the leaf tip are usually about three teeth, sometime the margin is wholly entire. The surface of the leaf is initially slightly powdery, but this is lost later on.
The flower head is 1½–2 cm (0.6–0.8 in) in diameter and consists of four to seven flowers in one whorl set on a stalk of 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) long. Three or four lance-shaped involucral bracts of long with a pointy or pointed tip subtend the flower head or are entirely absent. The bracteole that is subtending the individual flower is 1–1½ cm (0.4–0.6 in) long and wide, oval in circumference with a pointy tip, sharply folded at the midvein and embracing the foot of the perianth, with a slightly powdery surface and a row of fine hairs around the rim. The perianth is very strongly curved toward the center of the flower head, in long. In the lower part of the perianth, the four lobes are fused into a tube which is much inflated towards its end, up to ½ cm (0.2 in) in diameter, without hairs. The middle part that consists of the claws is wide near the base, narrow near the tip and strongly coiled at anthesis. The three perianth lobes facing toward the center of the flower head and sideways are incompletely fused and about long, the free lobe facing the rim of the flower head is long. The outer surface is hairless, but where the tube splits in four, the margins have a row of woolly hairs. The four anthers are directly attached to the 2 mm (0.08 in) long upper part of the perianth by a swollen fleshy connection. The style that is 1¾–2 cm (0.7–0.8 in) long is very strongly bent (about 180°) towards the center of the flower head, and nearer to its tip both tapers and is set with stiff hairs facing towards the base, changing to coarsely powdery further toward the base. It is topped by a slight thickening called pollen presenter, which has a cone-shape with a pointy tip, is about 2 mm (0.08 in) long, with a groove at the very end that acts as the stigma. The ovary of about 1 mm (0.04 in) long, gradually merges into the style, has a fine powdery surface. It is subtended by four nectar producing blunt line-shaped scales of about 2 mm (0.08 in) long. The fruit is a cylindric, greyish-white achene, with a fine powdery surface and a central indent at its base.
The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus "Leucospermum" has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).
Taxonomy.
"L. hamatum" was named and described by John Patrick Rourke in 1983. The species name "hamatum" is derived from the Latin word meaning "hooked" and refers to the barbs near the tip of the styles. "L. hamatum" is the type species of the section "Hamatum".
Distribution, habitat and ecology.
"Leucospermum hamatum" is only known from one location on the Klein Moeras River Farm, in the northern foothills of the Outeniqua Mountains, in the catchment area of the Moordkuils River. In August 1982, more than a thousand specimens were found here, in an area of several hectares, at approximately altitude. In areas where wildfire had recently raged, only seedlings were found. Position and inconspicuousness of the flower heads make it unlikely that it is pollinated by either birds or insects. It is assumed that small rodents pollinate the flowers however. A relatively large amount of nectar accumulates in the bladder-like perianth tubes.
Conservation.
The Ruitersbos pincushion is considered endangered. Only five small subpopulations are known, spread over an area of about 20 km2. It may be threatened by the invasive "Hakea", which has been removed from the direct neighborhood of "L. hamatum", but which may spread again if it is not managed.

Crab Silvers

The Crab Silvers (カニカニ銀 "kani kani gin") is a shogi opening. It is a type of Rapid Attack Fortress opening, used mostly when playing Black (sente). It is often classified as a trap opening. It was created by professional shogi player Kōichi Kodama, for which he received the prestigious Kōzō Masuda Award in 2003.
Overview.
Due to the large amount of freedom of the rook to enter into the game, finding ways to attack even in the middle of a Rapid Attack Fortress has quite the merit.
Unlike the Double-Silver Rapid Attack Fortress, king and gold don't move at all from their initial position (Sitting king). In the fifth movement, rather than pushing P-66, the silver is pushed to S-77. Instead of opting not to push the rook pawn from Fortress, White (gote) will play S-33 following Black's rook pawn being pushed to P-25, which will be followed by ▲S-48, ▲P-56, ▲S-57, ▲S-46. After that, if White (gote) were to push the pawn in the 5th file, the rook will go to the center file with ▲R-58, and then, for example, ▲B-97, ▲S-66, ▲N-77, with the aim of breaking through the center. 
Although at first it was frequent for White (gote) to unthinkingly push the gold to △G-32, since it was difficult for Black (sente) to defend from a breakthrough from the center, making preparations beforehand by playing △G61-52 became more frequent. When aiming to attack from the center, pushing the pawn in the 3rd file with ▲P-36 allows the rival to attack the king on its weak points and also delays the attack, so it is often considered a bad move.

2018 Juan Martín del Potro tennis season

The 2018 Juan Martín del Potro tennis season officially commenced on 10 January 2018 with the start of the Delray Beach Open. This season saw Del Potro slightly improve on his previous results as well as his playing style. Highlights from his season includes winning his 400th career match in Indian Wells, where he won the first Masters 1000 title of his career. After he was forced to retire due to a leg injury in the Italian Open, his participation in the French Open was apparently at risk. However, the Argentine managed to recover in time and entered the tournament as the fifth seed. There, he performed notably well considering the doubts surrounding his physical condition, and the fact that clay is not the best surface for his style of play. His run to the semi-finals ensured that, for the first time since February 2014, Delpo would return to his career-best ranking of world No. 4.
All matches.

THUG Pro

THUG Pro (Tony Hawk's Underground: Pro) is a total conversion mod of the 2004 video game "Tony Hawk's Underground 2". It uses its gameplay as the basis for an all-encompassing collection of levels from every original Neversoft game in the series, for use in single-player and online multiplayer gameplay. 
The mod has been continuously updated since its initial beta release in 2013. The mod is free to download, but "Underground 2" must be installed.
Background and development.
According to developer Morten Larson in a 2018 interview with Vice, the idea for a mod such as THUG Pro had existed for a long time, but by 2012, felt it had become necessary; the community was struggling and fractured by that point, with the majority of the game's online servers having since been shut down, and those still playing on unofficial servers were spread across different platforms. 
The mod's first official beta release was on August 10, 2013. In its initial release, the mod featured all levels from "Tony Hawk's Underground" and its sequel "Underground 2", as well as custom park themes from "Pro Skater 4" and "American Wasteland". Over the time, more levels from the games were added; for instance, on December 13, 2015, the rest of the "Pro Skater 3" levels were added. Versions for macOS and Linux, based on Wine, were posted in the THPS forums, but as of 2019 the download links for these versions are broken. The game can still be installed manually in Wine.
In the same interview with Vice, Larson detailed long-term plans for the future of "THUG Pro", including mod support, new levels, a "Create-A-Theme" mode, custom soundtracks, and a higher resolution visual overhaul. These features appeared in update 0.6.0.0, released in late June 2018.
Gameplay.
"THUG Pro", being a mod of "Underground 2", has similar gameplay to that of the sixth generation-era entries in the "Tony Hawk" game series. The mod focuses on online multiplayer as its main game mode and there is no single-player campaign. Its only single-player mode is "Freeskate"/"High Score Run", which allows players to practice for online play. Online multiplayer consists of all traditional game types found in past "Tony Hawk" games.
The game includes a majority of the levels from the Neversoft era of the franchise except of "Tony Hawk's Proving Ground".
Features.
Aside from its inclusion of a majority of levels from throughout the "Tony Hawk's" series, "THUG Pro" also includes support of customized levels and soundtracks. Custom levels and skaters made by other users can be downloaded on the THPSX website. A Blender plugin used for importing and exporting custom levels into the "THUG2" format (as well as support for models from several other Tony Hawk games) was released in early 2017 by the user "asdf"; it was updated and re-released with expanded support and functionality in 2018 by the user "denetii", which near coincided with update 0.6.0.0's support for importing custom levels. This plugin can be used to export fanmade levels or those imported from elsewhere into Blender to "THUG Pro" as well as character models that can be rigged to an armature to be used in-game.
Reception.
A few months after the mod's initial beta launch, Luke Plunkett of "Kotaku" was optimistic about the idea of all levels in the series being available for online play. In reviews of the critically panned 2015 "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5", reviewers cited "THUG Pro" as a more enjoyable and affordable "Tony Hawk's Pro Skater" experience.

Charlesia Alexis

Charlesia Alexis (September 8, 1934 – December 16, 2012) was a Chagossian singer and activist, notable for helping establish the Chagos Refugee Group.
Early life.
She was born on Diego Garcia. Alexis and her family went to Port Louis on Mauritius in 1967 to get medical treatment for her husband. They were not permitted to return home afterwards because the United States wished to establish a military base in the archipelago.
Career.
In 1982, the British government paid compensation to the exiled Chagossians. However, by accepting the settlement, they also signed away their right to return. With Lisette Talate and Rita Bancoult, she established the Chagos Refugees Group in 1983. The Chagos Refugees Group took its battle to the British courts, winning in the lower courts but then seeing that result overturned by the Law Lords. The group next took their case to the European Court of Human Rights; in 2012, their case was judged inadmissible by that court.
In 2002, the displaced Chagossian were granted British citizenship. In 2004, Alexis settled in Crawley.
She also released several recordings of songs.
Alexis died in Crawley at the age of 78.

Stephen Vittoria

Stephen Vittoria (born January 11, 1957) is an American filmmaker and author born in Newark, New Jersey who currently resides in Los Angeles, California.
Early life.
Vittoria grew up in West Orange, New Jersey and attended West Orange Mountain High School. In 1973, when he was a 16-year-old high school student, Vittoria petitioned to run for the Board of Education of the West Orange Public Schools. Vittoria wanted student representation on the school board but was denied candidacy. With legal representation from the American Civil Liberties Union, the case went to the Supreme Court of the United States where Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. ruled against Vittoria and the ACLU.
Vittoria graduated Rider University, Lawrenceville, NJ in 1979 and Columbia College, Los Angeles, California 1981, where he studied film.
Career.
Feature films.
In 1987, Vittoria wrote and directed his first feature film, "Lou, Pat &amp; Joe D" (later titled "Black &amp; White"), starring Frank Vincent and Kim Delgado. Set in Newark, NJ after World War II, the film explores racism as mirrored through the friendship of two young boys.
In 1995, Vittoria produced, wrote, and directed "Hollywood Boulevard", starring John C. McGinley, Jon Tenney, and Julianne Phillips—a dark and satirical look at the motion picture business.
In 1996, Vittoria founded Street Legal Cinema—a production company dedicated to documentary filmmaking, as well as Deep Image, a commercial production company. Both companies continue successfully today.
In 2005, Vittoria produced, wrote, and directed the documentary feature film, "", which won the Jury Prize for "Best Documentary Feature" at the 2005 Sarasota Film Festival and was released in theaters nationwide by First Run Features.
In 2006, Vittoria wrote, directed, and edited the television documentary "Keeper of the Flame" with journalist Linda Ellerbee and actor Wilford Brimley, examining the ecological crisis facing American forests.
In 2008 and 2011, respectively, Vittoria was segment producer on "" and "Magic Trip: Ken Kesey's Search for a Kool Place", both directed by Alex Gibney.
In 2012, Vittoria produced, wrote, directed, and edited the feature documentary "Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary", released nationally by First Run Features and internationally by Monoduo Films Berlin. The film chronicles the career of imprisoned journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal, both before and during incarceration.
Publications.
In 2018, Vittoria and co-author Mumia Abu-Jamal published volume one of a three-part book series entitled, "Murder Incorporated: Empire, Genocide, and Manifest Destiny". The nonfiction series examines and critiques the history of the United States of America, from the arrival of Europeans to the early 21st century, making the argument that the founding and evolution of America as a nation has been driven primarily by conquest, exploitation, and murder.
Volume one in the series, "Dreaming of Empire", features an introduction by journalist Chris Hedges and deals with the early origins of the "American Empire". Topics covered include the role religious faith played in the psyche of early European colonizers; the devastation colonizers brought to the Native American population; the central economic role slavery played in establishing the new nation as a major power; the motives of the American Revolution; the Monroe Doctrine as an informal, but lasting, foundational document of the "American Empire"; and the early imperial expansion of America into Mexico and Latin America.
Still to be released are volumes two and three, "America's Favorite Pastime" and "Perfecting Tyranny", respectively.
"America's Favorite Pastime" scrutinizes America's major wars (World War I, World War II, the Vietnam War), military recruitment, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the Military Industrial Complex.
"Perfecting Tyranny" exposes economic and political systems that the authors argue work to maintain the American Empire from within, while also featuring groups and individuals who have resisted. Themes include the oppression and resistance of Black Americans and women, the Supreme Court, the American News Media, and the ever-expanding security and surveillance state.

Alternativa

Alternativa (styled as AlternativA) is a 2010 Czech adventure game developed by Centauri Production and First Reality, and published by Bohemia Interactive and IDEA Games for Windows.
Plot and gameplay.
"AlternativA" is a dystopian adventure game set in the post-apocalyptic future of 2045, where only a global government is in charge. Only two corporations survived: Endora Corporation (mining/construction) and Theolex Industries (technology). Richard Boček is fired from his job for no reason, and so he begins to resist, discovering conspiracy and murder along the way.
The game consists of combination puzzles. In addition, dialogue choices can affect whether Boček will succeed or be captured by the police. The game has difficulty levels; lower ones allow the player to redo a failed dialogue sequence. The game has a mouse controlled interface. It features 2.5D graphics with pre-rendered backgrounds and real-time 3D character models.
Reception.
"Adventure Gamers" appreciated the game's thought provoking dark themes. Przygodoskop negatively compared the title to Gemini Rue or the freeware game The Curfew. "4 Players" deemed it a mediocre game that promised too much and delivered too little. "Adventure-Treff" felt that if readers wanted a good sci-fi experience, they were better off playing the then 6-year old title "The Moment of Silenc"e instead.

HMCS Nonsuch

HMCS "Nonsuch" is a naval reserve division (NRD) located in Edmonton, Alberta. Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS "Nonsuch" is a land-based naval establishment for part-time sailors as well as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.
Operations.
"Nonsuch" is properly referred to as a ship, being commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy. She is part of the Reserves, and therefore operations are usually held on weekdays and certain weekends. However, her sailors may participate in any operation run by the Canadian Armed Forces year round, if they so choose.
History.
HMCS "Nonsuch" was formed on 23 March 1927, as an RCN reserve half-company. On 1 November 1941 she was commissioned as a tender to , now part of CFB Esquimalt. She was commissioned as the independent unit, HMCS "Nonsuch", on 1 September 1942. During World War 2, over 3500 sailors, and 114 officers were enlisted at "Nonsuch". After the war she transitioned into a peacetime force, and was paid off on 30 November 1964. She was recommissioned on September 26, 1975.
"Nonsuch" has two historic naval weapons outside of the building. One is a mark 12 5"/38 calibre gun, from the United States. It was originally to be used on a US Navy destroyer; however, the Second World War ended before the ship was built. The gun comes from a pair handed over to Canada for testing. The two guns were used to fire various ammunition in CFB Suffield, in southern Alberta. When they were deemed to have completed their jobs, they were turned over to HMCS "Nonsuch" and , located in Calgary. 
The second weapon "Nonsuch" has is a Bliss-Leavitt Mark 9 torpedo from the Second World War, as would have been launched from Canadian destroyers.
Battle honours.
HMCS "Nonsuch" carries on the battle honours of 11 Royal Navy ships bearing her name in the past.
Badge.
Description.
"Or a beaver rampant proper gorged with a collar Gules edged Or upon which a roundel displaying the device of St. George."
Etymology.
"Nonsuch" name comes from the French phrase meaning "of no equal". Besides being used as a name for many former RN warships, "Nonsuch" was also the first overseas ship into Hudson Bay, in 1688.

Highlighter (cosmetics)

Highlighter is a type of cosmetic product that reflects light. Often used for contouring, it can be applied to the face or other parts of the body to brighten the skin on a given area, create the perception of depth and angles. The product can come in a variety of forms, including powder, liquid, cream, gloss, solid stick and jelly.
Highlighters became a significant tool among theater and film actors shooting or performing indoors, where natural light was not available to provide definition of facial features like cheekbones, nose, and jawline. Highlighter also offers the possibility of heightening or diminishing a given feature to suit the character portrayed, as well as aesthetic trends.
MAC Cosmetics's Strobing Cream is credited as the first highlighter product to be made available to commercial consumers.
A long-time tool among makeup artists, highlighter sales saw significant gains among consumers in 2016. Some industry experts have attributed the growth in sales of highlighters and related products to the rise of social media usage, given the popularity of YouTube makeup tutorials and the proliferation of snapshot self-portraits known as selfies.

Oakley Street, Chelsea

Oakley Street is in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, London. It runs roughly north to south from King's Road to the crossroads with Cheyne Walk and the River Thames, where it continues as the Albert Bridge and Albert Bridge Road. The street was named after Baron Cadogan of Oakley.
History.
Much of the street is on the site of the former Winchester House, the one-time residence of the Bishops of Winchester in London who had bought the 17th-century part of Chelsea Place from Charles Cheyne in 1664 after the destruction of Winchester Palace in the English Civil War. In 1821, after the house fell into disrepair, the bishop successfully sought an Act that allowed him to sell the house and its ground of 2.5 acres to the trustees of the Cadogan Estate. In 1825, the trustees obtained a further Act to demolish the property and build new houses on the site. Demolition was complete by 1836, but the site was still vacant in 1847. By 1850, there were ten houses at the northern end, and four at the southern by 1851.
Notable buildings.
Numbers 1–11, 14–25, 26 and 27, 28–35 and 101–108 Oakley Street are listed grade II on the National Heritage List for England.
Notable residents.
No. 2 was owned by John Samuel Phene, a noted property developer and local eccentric.
No. 29 was lived in by Donald Maclean, one of the Cambridge Five spy ring, in the latter 1930s.
No. 42 was where Bob Marley moved to with his wife Rita in January 1977, following an attempt on his life in Jamaica.
No. 56 was the home of Antarctic explorer Robert Falcon Scott from 1904 to 1908, together with his mother and sister.
No. 74 was home to actress Dame Sybil Thorndike and her husband Lewis Casson in the 1930s.
No. 87 was home to Oscar Wilde and his mother Jane Wilde, and many years later, the footballer George Best.
No. 89 was the home of David Bowie from 1973 to at least 1976.
No. 93 was home to suffragettes in 1911, who refused to complete the 1911 census on the grounds of "no vote no census". However, the enumerator was able to confirm from the neighbours that the head of the house was Mrs Alice Monck Mason, who lived there with her daughter, Winifred Alice Monck Mason (and others), an actress who went by the name of Winifred Mayo.

Roméo Elvis

Roméo Johnny Elvis Kiki Van Laeken (; born 13 December 1992), better known by his stage name Roméo Elvis (), is a Belgian rapper and hip hop artist. 
His career began with the release of two EPs in 2013 and 2014, titled "Bruxelles c'est devenu la jungle" and "Famille nombreuse". In 2016, his album EP "Morale" was released. In 2017 and 2018, two more albums were released: "Morale 2" and his reissue "Morale 2 luxe" (released from his collaboration with producer Le Motel). He has close connections with Belgian band L'Or du Commun, duo Caballero &amp; JeanJass, and French rapper Lomepal.
Biography.
Roméo Elvis was born on 13 December 1992 in Uccle, Belgium. Interested in music since his youth, he developed a style distinct from that of his father, the singer Marka, his mother, the comedian Laurence Bibot, and his younger sister, the singer and pianist Angèle. Roméo Elvis was raised in Linkebeek, in the southern suburbs of Brussels, and later relocated to Forest.
After college, he continued his secondary studies at Saint-Luc Tournai Institute where he learned to paint and draw. It was during this time that Elvis began rapping with his friends. His artistic training continued at ESA 75, in Brussels, where he studied photo-journalism. While continuing to practice rap, he became close to members of L'Or du Commun.
While his first EPs were being released, Roméo Elvis was working as a cashier at the supermarket chain Carrefour. Despite his success, he was not able to earn enough money from rapping alone. Shortly before the release of the album "Bruxelles arrive", he quit his job and devoted himself solely to music. His newest EP, "Morale 2luxe", was released on February 15, 2018. "Morale 2luxe" is a remake of his album, "Morale 2", released in March 2017.
Elvis suffers from tinnitus, common among musicians. He has made references to this condition in many of his titles, such as "L'oreille sifflante" and "Ma tête." In an interview with Radio Nova, he explained that if he could earn a substantial income from rapping he would donate some of it to fight the disease. 
In 2019 Elvis collaborated with French sportswear brand Lacoste to create a limited collection. However, after being named on social media for sexual assault he was dropped by the label.
Musical style and influence.
The musical style of Roméo Elvis has evolved with the progression of his projects. While developing old-school instrumentals and a flow with similar ambiance to his first two EPs, his collaboration with the producer Le Motel on "Morale" and "Morale 2" profoundly changed his style. He currently allows himself to make more refrains and add electronic instrumentals, and in accord with the jazz of Le Motel, giving them a more current tone.
Elvis' influences are numerous: the Belgian group L'or du Commun with which he made his rapping debut is one of his main ones. Their style can also be recognized in his first two projects with group members. He also frequently mentions the rapper Caballero as someone who greatly inspired him; they met while "Bruxelles arrive" was being recorded. Concerning French rap, Elvis considers the rapper Alpha Wann of the group 1995 as "the rap master playing for me in terms of placement and in terms of how to say things in a very meaningful way". Fuzati, leader of Klub des Loosers, strongly influences the rapper. Primarily in his somber aspect, but also in the manner that the rapper holds plenty of derision towards life. He also references the masked rapper in many of his titles, like in "Drôle de décision." Elvis is also a fan of the French artist Philippe Katerine.
Concerts and tours.
While he began performing at concerts while growing closer to L'Or du Commun, it was during the release of "Morale," in 2015, that Roméo Elvis and Le Motel began touring, with 19 performances across Belgium, France, and Luxembourg. The release of "Morale 2 "also marked the beginning of another, bigger tour with 29 performances and concerts in several large festivals such as Dour Festival, Rock en Seine, le Printemps de Bourges, and Garorock.

<doc id="56951289" url="?curid=56951289" title="Clydesdale Motor Truck Company">
Clydesdale Motor Truck Company

The Clydesdale Motor Truck Company was a motor company that existed from 1917 to 1939 with headquarters in Clyde, Ohio. Initially, they made military trucks for World War I. Military contracts continued to be a large part of their business after the war, but they also sold into many other markets: general haulage, farming, and specialized vehicles such as fire trucks. They survived the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, but increasingly struggling, they were wound up in 1939. 
Name.
The name "Clydesdale" was chosen in part as a reference to the valley of the River Clyde in Scotland, archaically known as Clydesdale. Clyde, Ohio, the location of the company, is named after Clyde, New York, which in turn is named after the Scottish river. In part, the name was meant to invoke the Clydesdale horse, a strong draught horse used for haulage at the time, in an age when horse transport was still common. The breed of horse also originates in the same Scottish region.
History.
The company was formed in 1917 from the merger of three companies with Charles R. Dunbar as president. Two of these companies were based in Clyde, Ohio and had been established for some time. The larger company was the Clyde Cars Company, and the other was Krebs Commercial Car Company led by John C. Krebs, usually known as Louis, who became vice-president of the new company. The third company was the Lincoln Motor Truck Company based in Detroit. Lincoln was a new company formed in 1917 and made engines. Much of Lincoln's operation was transferred to Clyde after the merger. The merged company was initially called the Clyde Cars Company and the Clydesdale name was used as a brand name for its trucks. In 1919 the company changed its name to the Clydesdale Truck Company.
Louis Krebs.
Krebs first became involved with motor vehicles at the Elmore Manufacturing Company. Elmore was originally located in Elmore, Ohio but in 1893 moved to the Amanda Street site in Clyde that was later to become the Clydesdale Truck Co. Elmore was originally a bicycle manufacturer but they started manufacturing cars in 1900. They became known for their highly regarded two-stroke cars, the 1907 patent of which bears Krebs' name along with Frank Bachle. In 1909 Elmore was taken over by General Motors, and in 1912 moved Elmore operations to Detroit.
Krebs left Elmore when General Motors took over. In 1912 Krebs and Bachle purchased the vacated Amanda Street factory from General Motors and formed the Krebs Commercial Car Company. Krebs retooled the factory to make trucks rather than cars. A big selling point of Krebs' trucks was the provision of a governor, an early form of cruise control. The Amanda Street factory remained the center of operations after the merger forming the Clydesdale company.
World War I.
The immediate production of the Clydesdale company on its formation in 1917 was for war production. The truck Clydesdale produced for military use was designed in partnership with the London General Omnibus Company. By this stage of the war the London company had gained extensive experience in making trucks suitable for the conditions of war. The US military on the other hand had very little experience; in 1911 the US Army owned a total of just twelve trucks, although they saw rather more significant use in the 1916 campaign against Pancho Villa. In comparison, British companies supplied 25,000 trucks for military use during the course of the war.
Clydesdale was not part of the order for 50,000 Liberty trucks placed by general John J. Pershing when the US entered the war. However, they were still successful in selling trucks to the US and other militaries, often for specialized purposes. The requirement for trucks far exceeded Pershing's initial order and Clydesdale struggled to keep up with demand. Trucks were shipped to Europe in kit form to reduce shipping tonnage. Clydesdale were particularly good at getting trucks into the smallest possible crate. It was claimed that Clydesdale trucks were shipped in smaller crates than Ford cars.
Post war.
In 1919, Clydesdale opened an additional factory in Toronto, Canada. Krebs resigned from the company in 1922. In 1925 the company went into receivership and was sold to a new owner. The company survived the Great Depression which finished off half of US independent truck companies. Most of their business during this period was repairs and spares. However, in 1938 the US Navy cancelled a large order which led to the collapse of the company and it was wound up in 1939.
Models.
Early 1920s models included (horsepower according to SAE standard);
In 1922 Clydesdale introduced the Model 10 all-steel truck. In 1923 they moved into passenger vehicles with a 6-cylinder motor coach. In 1937 they began production of 4- and 6-cylinder diesel trucks (previous models had been gasoline). Around the same time they sold 15-ton 6×6 trucks to the US Army.
Advertising.
References to the Clydesdale horse were rarely used in Clydesdale's advertising, although some examples showing an image of such horses are known. After World War I, Clydesdale tried to use their association with the London General Omnibus Company for promotion, cashing in on that company's greater experience in building tough military vehicles. They advertised their trucks as "practically a duplicate" of LGO's wartime truck. They also emphasised ruggedness in their advertisements aimed at the farming market.

1896 United States presidential election in Kansas

The 1896 United States presidential election in Kansas took place on November 3, 1896. All contemporary 45 states were part of the 1896 United States presidential election. Kansas voters chose ten electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Kansas was won by the Democratic nominees, former U.S. Representative William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska and his running mate Arthur Sewall of Maine. 
With his win in the state, Bryan became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state of Kansas. Bryan would later lose Kansas to Republican William McKinley four years later during their rematch and would later lose the state again to William Howard Taft in 1908. This is also the only election since Kansas statehood in which the Republican candidate won the presidency without Kansas. Until 2020, this is the last election in which the majority of Johnson County voted Democratic.

Henry S. Russell

Henry Sturgis Russell (June 21, 1838 – February 16, 1905) was an American military and government official who served as commander of the 5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry and as the first commissioner of the Boston Fire Department.
Early life.
Russell was born on June 21, 1838, in the Savin Hill section of Dorchester, Massachusetts to George R. and Sarah Parkinson (Shaw) Russell. His grandfather was ambassador Jonathan Russell and his first cousin was Robert Gould Shaw. Russell graduated from Harvard University in 1860.
Military career.
Russell entered the Union Army on May 11, 1861, as a lieutenant in the 2nd Massachusetts Cavalry. He was promoted to captain on December 13, 1861. He was captured at the Battle of Cedar Mountain (August 9, 1862) and sent to Libby Prison. He was released in a prisoner exchange and returned to duty on November 15, 1862. On January 22, 1863, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. On April 5, 1864, he was made a colonel of the 5th Regiment Massachusetts Colored Volunteer Cavalry. When the regiment reached Washington D.C., Russell was briefly assigned command of a brigade at Camp Casey. On May 13 he was ordered to join General Edward Winslow Hincks' division in City Point, Virginia. On June 15, Russell was wounded in the Siege of Petersburg. He rejoined his regiment on September 30 at Point Lookout, Maryland, where his regiment was guarding Confederate prisoners of war. He resigned his command on February 15, 1865, and was brevetted brigadier general on March 13, 1865.
Business career and family.
After the war, Russell joined J.M. Forbes &amp; Co., where he sold goods from China and East India. In 1863 he married Mary Hathaway, the daughter of John Murray Forbes. The couple had five children.
Government appointments.
In 1878, control of the Boston Police Department was transferred from the board of alderman to an independent police commission. Mayor Henry L. Pierce appointed Russell to chair the new board. Russell was credited with creating the harbor police, reorganizing the force on a semi-military basis (the first reorganization of the department since its founding in 1854), proposing new rules for conduct and definitions of duties, arranging for merit-based promotions, and instituting physical examinations for officers under the rank of captain. He left the board in 1880.
In January 1895, he was appointed by Mayor Edwin Upton Curtis to succeed John R. Murphy on the Boston Fire commission. That July, Russell became the first solo commissioner in the department's history. During his tenure as commissioner, Russell hired and promoted based on merit rather than political considerations and worked to improve living conditions in the city's firehouses. He remained commissioner until his death on February 16, 1905.
In 1909, a drinking fountain in memory of Russell was erected in Milton, Massachusetts, where he had been a summer resident for many years.

Mamamah International Airport

Mamamah International Airport was an airport under construction in Sierra Leone. It was part of the infrastructure to be built as Sierra Leone prepared to shift its political and administrative capital, away from over-crowded Freetown.
Location.
Mamamah Airport was to be located in Mamboima, near "Songo Village", Koya Chiefdom in Port Loko District, approximately , by road, south-east of Freetown, the capital and largest city in the West African country. The average elevation of Songo Village is , above sea level.
Overview.
This airport would be a large international airport capable of handling large passenger and cargo aircraft. The airport development was expected to be followed by the construction of a new State House, parliament building, ministry buildings, court houses and other support facilities. The developments were intended to improve Sierra Leone's competitiveness as the country prepares to become a middle income country by 2035.
Other related development projects are the planned bridging of "Tagrin Bay", which separates Freetown from the peninsula on which Lungi International Airport is located, and the ongoing expansion of the port of Freetown.
The Mamamah airport contract has been terminated.
The new SLPP government lead by President Maada Bio canceled the contract with the Chinese construction company, that contracted to build the proposed airport.
Construction.
"China Railway International Group" (CRI), a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited (CREC), had been contracted to build the airport at a cost of US$318 million, borrowed from the Exim Bank of China. Work began in March 2018 and completion was expected in 2022.
Controversy.
This development project has drawn criticism from the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) because of the level of debt that the country would be left with.
Cancellation.
The project was cancelled in October 2018, following a change in government/president. The new Aviation Minister Kabineh Kallon said that the president saw no need for a new airport and preferred to refurbish Lungi International Airport and possibly build a bridge to link Lungi directly to Freetown. The Lungi Bridge project was later announced by the president.

Group functor

In mathematics, a group functor is a group-valued functor on the category of commutative rings. Although it is typically viewed as a generalization of a group scheme, the notion itself involves no scheme theory. Because of this feature, some authors, notably Waterhouse and Milne (who followed Waterhouse), develop the theory of group schemes based on the notion of group functor instead of scheme theory.
A formal group is usually defined as a particular kind of a group functor.
Group functor as a generalization of a group scheme.
A scheme may be thought of as a contravariant functor from the category formula_1 of "S"-schemes to the category of sets satisfying the gluing axiom; the perspective known as the functor of points. Under this perspective, a group scheme is a contravariant functor from formula_1 to the category of groups that is a Zariski sheaf (i.e., satisfying the gluing axiom for the Zariski topology).
For example, if Γ is a finite group, then consider the functor that sends Spec("R") to the set of locally constant functions on it. For example, the group scheme
can be described as the functor
If we take a ring, for example, formula_5, then
Group sheaf.
It is useful to consider a group functor that respects a topology (if any) of the underlying category; namely, one that is a sheaf and a group functor that is a sheaf is called a group sheaf. The notion appears in particular in the discussion of a torsor (where a choice of topology is an important matter).
For example, a "p"-divisible group is an example of a fppf group sheaf (a group sheaf with respect to the fppf topology).

United Nations Command–Rear

United Nations Command–Rear (also known as UN Command–Rear or UNC–Rear) is a rump military command headquartered in Japan, and a subordinate element of United Nations Command. UN Command–Rear was established in 1957 as a result of the relocation of UN Command from Japan to South Korea following the Korean War. It is nominally in control of the rear elements of what the United States and South Korea contend are United Nations military forces in northeast Asia.
In practice, UN Command–Rear is a legal cover created to prevent the expiration of the 1954 Status of Forces Agreement between the United States (operating as the "Unified Command") and Japan, which provides for its self-termination upon the withdrawal of United Nations forces from Japan. As of 2018, UN Command–Rear had a strength of four personnel.
History.
Background.
The defeat of Japan in World War II led to the collapse of the Government of Korea under Japanese rule and the territorial bifurcation of the Korean Peninsula between the Pyongyang-based and Soviet-backed Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) and the Seoul-headquartered and United States-supported Republic of Korea (South Korea).
On June 12, 1950, the South Korean Army informed the United States' Korean Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea that North Korea's Korean People's Army (KPA) was massing for an invasion. Approximately two weeks later, according to the United States and South Korea, the KPA staged a surprise assault against South Korean military positions along the border, easily overwhelming the South's defenses. North Korea advanced the alternate explanation that the entry of its forces into South Korea was done for the purposes of arresting Syngman Rhee due to what it claimed was a preemptive South Korean incursion that had taken place near Haeju. The ensuing conflagration sparked the Korean War between North and South Korea and their respective allies and patrons.
Following the outbreak of hostilities, the United Nations Security Council voted to authorize armed intervention on the side of South Korea. The United States agreed to be named "executive agent" of the United Nations and, subsequently, formed United Nations Command. UN Command, under General Douglas MacArthur and his wartime successors, oversaw military operations on the Korean Peninsula from headquarters in Japan.
Formation.
Active hostilities concluded in 1953 and UN Command relocated from Japan to South Korea four years later. A 1954 Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) between the United States (signed as "the Government of the United States of America acting as the Unified Command") with Japan required UN Command to maintain a presence in that nation as a precondition for continued use of Japanese territory for military purposes. A break in the presence of forces under UN command in Japan would cause the termination of the SOFA and allow Japan to reassert total sovereignty over its territory. Specifically, Article 15 of the 1954 Status of Forces Agreement specifies that "this Agreement and agreed revisions thereof shall terminate on the date by which all the United Nations forces shall be withdrawn from Japan".
United Nations Command–Rear was created as a legal construct to ensure the treaty requirements needed for indefinite use of Japanese territory were met, or what "The Mandarin" has described as "a form of legal trickery". UN Command–Rear describes its existence as one designed "to maintain the UN‐GOJ SOFA [United Nations-Government of Japan Status of Forces Agreement]".
Upon formation of UN Command–Rear, it was decided that it should be placed under an officer who was not American so that it would not appear to be "a parochial US organisation". From 1957 to 1976, Thailand supplied an officer to UN Command–Rear, following which command responsibilities were assumed by the United Kingdom for two years. From 1978 until at least 1987, the Philippines provided an officer to lead UN Command Rear. Since 2010, Australia has made an officer available to the United States to be placed in command of UN Command–Rear.
In 2007, UN Command–Rear relocated from its longtime headquarters at Camp Zama to Yokota Air Base.
Status.
Status according to the United States.
The United States maintains that United Nations Command, to which United Nations Command–Rear answers, is a military organization of the United Nations. The U.S. also asserts that Security Council Resolution 84 made it the "executive agent" of the United Nations in Korea and that the UN had, through that process, delegated to the U.S. the authority to organize and command military forces on behalf of the UN and to independently determine when peace did or did not exist in Korea.
Journalist Selig S. Harrison said the United States' reason for advancing this position instead of asserting a bilateral alliance between the U.S. and South Korea is substantially due to its desire to legally maintain perpetual access to Japanese territory, which is achieved via the existence of UN Command–Rear, without the requirement to seek prior Japanese approval. While the 1961 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United States and Japan also gives the U.S. access to Japanese territory, it requires prior consultation with the Japanese government before American forces can enter Japan.
Status according to the United Nations.
In 1994, United Nations Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali stated that the UN "did not establish the unified command as a subsidiary organ under its control, but merely recommended the creation of such a command, specifying that it be under the authority of the United States" and that – since, in its view, the UN Command is not a UN body – only the U.S. can dissolve it. Narushige Michishita of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies has signaled his agreement with that interpretation, explaining that United Nations Command–Rear is, for all intents and purposes, an organization of the United States Government.
Status according to North Korea.
North Korea claims that the United States "used the United Nations as a tool of realizing their wild ambition of world domination ... and participated in the war in the guise of the UN flag in order to hide the true colours of war-maker". Pak Chol Gu of the Pyongyang-based Korean Anti-Nuclear Peace Committee has described UN Command as a "phantom body" and has said that "since the founding of the United Nations, such a command has existed only in South Korea".
Operations.
Authority.
According to the "Australian Defence Force Journal", UNC–R performs "certain administrative, support and liaison functions of a diplomatic type". Specifically, United Nations Command–Rear nominally has joint authority, with the United States, over seven UN-flagged bases in Japan: Camp Zama, Yokota Air Base, Yokosuka Naval Base, Sasebo Naval Base, Kadena Air Base, White Beach Naval Facility, and Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. In practice, all facilities are under the operational control of the United States.
UN Command–Rear is also charged with providing legal notice to Japan regarding the entry of military forces from any of the nine SOFA co-signer states into Japanese territory, specifically, those of the United States, United Kingdom, Philippines, Australia, Canada, France, New Zealand, Turkey, and Thailand. Under the SOFA agreement, the movement of signatory state military forces into Japan can occur with or without Japanese approval. The agreement does require that a courtesy notice be provided to the Japanese government in advance of the entry of military forces into the country except in exigent circumstances in which case military forces can enter Japan without advance notification being given to the Japanese government.
In 2014, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for greater Japanese input into the operational use of US Forces Japan. In response, according to the "Chosun Ilbo", the United States indicated that emergency deployment of U.S. forces could occur "automatically" and that "Tokyo would not have a say in the matter". The "Chosun Ilbo" noted that U.S. facilities in Japan are under UN Command–Rear and "thus there is no basis for Japan to meddle".
Personnel.
As of 2007, United Nations Command–Rear had a strength of four personnel.
According to Roger Chiasson, a former Canadian military officer who served as deputy commander of UN Command–Rear, his duties were "anything but onerous" and allowed him to live "a life of great privilege" during his assignment as second-in-command of the four-person unit, including access to various United States government-owned golf courses, stores, and a private hotel in downtown Tokyo.

Rosendo Rodriguez

Rosendo Rodriguez III (March 26, 1980 – March 27, 2018) was an American murderer sentenced to death and executed in Texas for the September 2005 rape and murder of 29-year-old Summer Baldwin in Lubbock, Texas.
Rodriguez, a Marine reservist with no prior criminal convictions, was in Lubbock for training at the time of the murder, and was also found to be responsible for the murder of 16-year-old Joanna Rogers in the same city the preceding May (the killings were linked by Rodriguez's modus operandi, as both victims were found stuffed into suitcases which ended up in the same Lubbock landfill). Rodriguez was executed at the Huntsville Unit on March 27, 2018, the day after his 38th birthday.
Background.
Rodriguez was born on March 26, 1980, in Wichita Falls, northern Texas. He allegedly faced abuse from his alcoholic and domineering father, Rosendo Rodriguez Jr. He attended Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and had worked as an office clerk and as a fast food worker, as well as serving as a Marine reservist.
Murders.
On September 13, 2005, the body of Summer Lee Baldwin was found in a Lubbock landfill. She was found to have died of asphyxiation and to have suffered numerous beatings. Summer, a 29-year-old native of Washington state, was working as a sex worker in Lubbock when she disappeared two days earlier, and had also been serving as a witness in a federal counterfeiting case, bringing her murder to the attention of the FBI. Summer was also around 5 weeks pregnant when she was killed, which served as an aggravating factor at Rodriguez's 2008 trial. Rodriguez was linked to the killing via a UPC on the suitcase, and he had been arrested by September 15. He was also identified on CCTV footage as having bought the suitcase from a nearby Walmart in the early hours of September 12. In October 2006, the remains of Joanna Kathryn Rogers were found in the same landfill as that of Summer Baldwin after an extensive search. Joanna had been missing since May 2004.
During his interrogation, Rodriguez claimed that he and Summer entered a hotel room on the night of September 11, had consensual sex through the early hours of September 12, and that Rodriguez strangled her after she pulled a knife on him. He told a similar story regarding Rogers, who he claimed became violent after he refused to pay her for having sex with him.
Trial, appeals, and execution.
Rodriguez was initially offered a plea deal that involved him pleading guilty to the murders of both women, but he refused at the last minute. He was convicted of the capital murder of Summer, and he was sentenced to death by lethal injection. During his incarceration, he contributed to inmate blog "Minutes before Six" on matters of criminal justice and politics.
Rodriguez's lawyer appealed the sentence based on a potential Brady disclosure violation by District Attorney Matt Powell for failing to disclose information regarding activities of the medical examiner who performed one of the autopsies.
On October 30, 2017, an appeal by Rodriguez to the US Supreme Court was denied. He was executed as scheduled on March 27, 2018.
In his final statement he called for investigation of Powell and medical examiner Sridhar Natarajan, saying they had been involved in multiple wrongful convictions. He also called for a boycott of Texas businesses until capital punishment is ended there.

This is to resolve the issues, in the terms of touch screen interactions, introduced by factors such as large finger size and the lack of sensing precision. To make use of the techniques, a user would adjust the control-display ratio using a secondary finger, while controlling the cursor movements using the primary finger. The paper also introduces SimPress, a clicking technique, which reduces motion errors during the process of clicking as well as enable hovering state on devices that are not able to support proximity.
The user study in paper reported that in terms of error rate reduction, the 3 chosen techniques (Stretch, X-Menu, and Slider) outperformed the control technique and were favoured by the participants. Among the chosen techniques Stretch, X-menu and Slider, Stretch has the best performance and preference overall.
Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects.
The paper Halo: a technique for visualizing off-screen objects was published on April 5, 2003, by Patrick Baudisch and Ruth Rosenholtz, totally cited 453 times.
The paper introduces Halo, a visualization technique that shows users the location of off-screen objects, to enable spatial cognition. Halo achieves this by showing parts of rings in border region of the display to indicate off screen objects. Users can then identify the exact location of the off-screen objects based on the location and portion of the rings that are visible.
The paper reported that users completed tasks 16-33% faster, giving no significant differences on error rates within the scope of the study.
Shift: a technique for operating pen-based interfaces using touch.
The paper Shift: a technique for operating pen-based interfaces using touch was published on April 29, 2007 by Daniel Vogel and Patrick Baudisch, totally cited 429 times.
The paper proposes Shift, a pointing technique, so that users can touch target points on screens designed for styluses with high precision using their fingers rather than a stylus. Shift reduces targeting times and error rates by showing a copy of the targeted screen area at a separate location. Shift also shows a pointer to the actual selection point of the finger. Note that Shift is only enabled when the users find it necessary so that users have the option to have the conventional touch screen experience.
Report results show that participants' actions have much lower error rates than an ordinary touch screen, and shorter times overall for larger targets compared to Offset Cursor.
Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick: Techniques for accessing remote screen content on touch-and pen-operated systems.
The paper Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick: Techniques for accessing remote screen content on touch-and pen-operated systems was published in August 2003 by Patrick Baudisch, Edward Cutrell, Dan Robbins, Mary Czerwinski, Peter Tandler, Benjamin Bederson and Alex Zierlinger, totally cited 405 times.
The paper presents interaction techniques Drag-and-pop and drag-and-pick, designed for display systems based on pen and touch interactions, and they grant users the access to see contents on screen that are otherwise not easy to reach. Drag-and-pop extends traditional drag-and-drop. More specifically, drag-and-pop responds to users by moving the potential target icons in users' cursor direction temporarily, so that users only need to move their hands on a smaller distance or scale. Drag-and-pick further extends drag-and-pop by activating icons such as to open folders or applications.
Results of the study report that drag-and-pop interface enables participants to file icons as fast as 3.7 times than the traditional drag-and-drop interaction on a 15' wide display.
Lucid touch: a see-through mobile device.
The paper Lucid touch: a see-through mobile device was published on October 7, 2007, by Daniel Wigdor, Clifton Forlines, Patrick Baudisch, John Barnwell and Chia Shen, totally cited 303 times.
The paper focus on the difficult aspects of touch screens: touching the small screen of a mobile device can be inconvenient because users' hands and fingers could block the contents they plan to interact with. This paper introduces LucidTouch, a mobile device that users control from the back. LucidTouch displays an image of users' hands on screen, so that it gives the illusion that LucidTouch is transparent when in fact it is not. Users are able to interact with targets with greater precision because of the pseudo-transparency. Furthermore, like an ordinary mobile touch screen, LucidTouch reacts to multiple touch points at the same time so users can perform multi-touch actions
Initial study results illustrate that because of factors such as improved accuracy, and unblocked view of the screen, many users prefer interactions with LucidTouch than interactions with conventional devices.

Sally Mursi

Sally Mursi (ar: سالي مرسي, born March 30, 1968) is an Egyptian entertainer and transgender woman. Her sex reassignment surgery in 1988 was a source of controversy and lawsuits in Egypt.
Transition.
Prior to pursuing medical operations, Mursi consulted with psychologist Salwa Jirjis Labib and underwent three years of conversion therapy, after which Labib referred her to a surgeon. Mursi was further referred to plastic surgeon Ezzat Ashamallah, who affirmed the diagnosis of "psychological hermaphroditism" and prescribed hormone replacement therapy for one year prior performing surgery on January 29, 1988.
Legal battle.
As a medical student at Al-Azhar University, Mursi had been suspended pre-transition for wearing women's clothing. When she returned post-transition, the university expelled her and initiated a legal battle against the physician Ashamallah, causing him to be removed from the Physician’s Syndicate. The Syndicate requested a fatwa on the case from Sheikh Muhammad Sayyid Tantawy, who designated the issue as a medical condition and subject to physician's discretion. Al-Azhar brought the case against Ashamallah to court, in which process Sally was subjected to a full body examination. The examiner confirmed the diagnosis and Ashamallah was acquitted.

List of UK top-ten albums in 2003

The UK Albums Chart is one of many music charts compiled by the Official Charts Company that calculates the best-selling albums of the week in the United Kingdom. Before 2004, the chart was only based on the sales of physical albums. This list shows albums that peaked in the Top 10 of the UK Albums Chart during 2003, as well as albums which peaked in 2002 and 2004 but were in the top 10 in 2003. The entry date is when the album appeared in the top 10 for the first time (week ending, as published by the Official Charts Company, which is six days after the chart is announced).
One-hundred and twenty-two albums were in the top ten this year. Sixteen albums from 2002 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while "Elephunk" by The Black Eyed Peas and "Twentysomething" by Jamie Cullum were both released in 2003 but did not reach their peak until 2004. "Come Away with Me" by Norah Jones, "Justified" by Justin Timberlake, "Let Go" by Avril Lavigne and "Missundaztood" by Pink were the albums from 2002 to reach their peak in 2003. Eleven artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2003. 50 Cent, Busted, Girls Aloud, Michael Bublé and Sean Paul were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 album in 2003.
The first number-one album of the year was "Let Go" by Avril Lavigne. Overall, twenty-five different albums peaked at number-one in 2003, with twenty-five unique artists hitting that position. 
Background.
Multiple entries.
One-hundred and twenty-two albums charted in the top 10 in 2003, with one-hundred and eight albums reaching their peak this year (including "" and "The Very Best of Cat Stevens", which both charted in previous years but reached a peak on their latest chart run).
Eleven artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 2003. Blue, Busted, Elvis Presley, Pink, Rachel Stevens, Red Hot Chili Peppers, R. Kelly, Robbie Williams, Sugababes and Westlife were the acts who had two top 10 albums this year. Busted and R. Kelly's two entries were both released this year.
Chart debuts.
Twenty-nine artists achieved their first top 10 album in 2003 as a lead artist. Busted and R. Kelly both had one more entry in their breakthrough year.
The following table (collapsed on desktop site) does not include acts who had previously charted as part of a group and secured their first top 10 solo album, or featured appearances on compilations or other artists recordings. 
As members of Destiny's Child, Kelly Rowland and Beyoncé had two top 10 albums to their name ("The Writing's on the Wall" in 1999 and "Survivor" two years later). Both had debut solo albums in 2003 that reached high positions - Beyoncé's "Dangerously in Love" and Kelly Rowland's "Simply Deep" topped the chart. 
Ex Hear'Say singer Kym Marsh peaked at number 9 with her first and only solo album "Standing Tall". Rachel Stevens broke out on her own after S Club went on hiatus and she made the top 10 with "Funky Dory", her debut album.
Best-selling albums.

Crime of Gádor

The crime of Gádor was the name given to the kidnapping and subsequent murder of a seven-year-old boy by Francisco Leona in Gádor, Almería, Spain. The purpose of the crime was to use the child's blood and body fat as a folk cure for a wealthy patron's tuberculosis.
Background.
At the time, it was believed that drinking the blood of a human child and using their body fat as cataplasm was a remedy for tuberculosis.
Francisco Ortega "El Moruno" ("The Moor") had recently been diagnosed with tuberculosis and was desperately seeking a cure. He visited the local curandera Agustina Rodriguez, who in turn sent for the barber and healer Francisco Leona. Leona, who also had a criminal record, agreed to cure Ortega in exchange for 3000 reales.
Leona and Julio "El Tonto" ("The Fool") Hernández, a son of Agustina the healer, offered to find a child. On the evening of June 27, 1910, Francisco Leona kidnapped Bernardo Gonzalez Parra, a seven year old from Rioja, drugged him with chloroform and put him in a sack.
Murder.
A brother of Julio "Tonto" Hernández, Joseph Hernández, was to advise the client Ortega, leaving his wife Elena to make dinner.
Little Bernardo's murder was as follows: after he was removed from the sack, dazed, Bernardo was stabbed in the heart by Leona, and Ortega mixed his blood with sugar and drank it. After that they took the boy to a place known as Las Pocicas where Leona killed him, crushing his skull with a rock. Then he extracted fat and mesentery to make a compress to apply to Ortega's chest.
To finish the ritual, Bernardo's body was concealed in a crevice, unburied but covered with herbs and stones, located in Las Pocicas.
When distributing the actual 3000 Ortega paid him for his services, the healer Leona tried and failed to trick his accomplice "Tonto" Hernández. Realizing Leona's intentions, Hernández told the Civil Guard who had seen the body of a child while he was chasing partridges.
Judicial and police intervention.
When law enforcement officers arrived, the people of Gádor turned Leona over to them, as he was known for his illegal and occult practices. During court proceedings, Leona indicted "el Tonto" Hernández in his testimony, who in turn did the same to Leona. Finally, after multiple excuses, both confessed to the crime.
Most of the perpetrators were executed by hanging. Leona was sentenced to death by garrote, but died in prison. The client, Ortega, and Agustina, the curandera, were both sentenced to death. Joseph Hernández, was sentenced to 17 years in prison while his wife, Elena, was acquitted. Julio "el Tonto" was sentenced to death too, but received a pardon on grounds of insanity following a psychiatric report.
Aftermath.
This crime gave rise to the terms "Hombre del saco" and "Sacamantecas", because the kidnapers used a gunny sack to carry the children. It was defined as "medical crime," inspired by folk beliefs about the medicinal properties of human blood and children's "manteca".
A TV episode named "El sacamantecas" was released in 1986. A documentary directed by Juan Francisco Viruega and named "La cicatriz" was released on 21 November 2019 during the Festival de Cine de Almería.

Straight Jacket

"Straight Jacket" is a song by Canadian rock band Theory of a Deadman from their sixth studio album, "Wake Up Call" (2017). It is the second single from the record, following "Rx (Medicate)". Produced by Martin Terefe, it was recorded at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios in London and was released on January 16, 2018. Its music video, which was inspired by the American film "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", was unveiled three weeks later on the band's official YouTube page.
The single has been met with mixed reviews with certain lyrics and musical aspects being perceived as negative by its critics. The track is the band's 22nd song to enter the "Billboard"'s Mainstream Rock, peaking at number 12 in May 2018.
Recording and composition.
"Straight Jacket" was co-written by all four members of Theory of a Deadman, who enlisted the assistance of Swedish producer, Martin Terefe, to work on "Wake Up Call". Recorded at Terefe's Kensaltown Studios in London, the song was released on January 16, 2018, and was promoted with a contest on Theory of a Deadman's official website in which participants would have a chance to win a straitjacket autographed by the band and a merchandise bundle.
Lead singer Tyler Connolly revealed that the single was formed in the days leading up to the album's recording. He stated that the beginning lyrics of the intro, "I wear a 36 long / White is my color", were developed first and that it took some time to complete the writing process due to the amount of lyrics. The track was composed with the assistance of a piano, characterized by the staccato notes in the beginning of the single. The piano is an instrument that Connolly had been teaching himself to play, with "Wake Up Call" being the first album in which most of the songwriting had been done with this instrument instead of a guitar. Connolly noted that the piano "opened [a] whole new world of creativity" for him, allowing for songs like "Straight Jacket" to formulate.
Commercial performance and critical reception.
"Straight Jacket" debuted at number 37 on "Billboard"'s Mainstream Rock chart and peaked at number 12 in May 2018. In a review of "Wake Up Call", James Christopher Monger of AllMusic called "Straight Jacket" a "lurid opener" to the album that "catered to the band's worst tendencies". "Alternative Addiction" called the song "listenable" while Allen J. Miller at Cryptic Rock disagreed, calling it "unlistenable". Jonni D at Über Röck also criticized the single, viewing the staccato piano notes as "infuriating" and castigating Connolly's "new-found penchant for rapping".
Music video.
The music video for "Straight Jacket" was released on February 7, 2018, via Theory of a Deadman's official YouTube account. Directed by Iqbal Ahmed, it was inspired by the 1975 American film, "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", focusing on the band in an insane asylum and their escape from the institution. Connolly expressed how he was exhausted of the idea of performance-based music videos, opting for video concepts that entailed a story line for both "Straight Jacket" and the band's previous single, "Rx (Medicate)".

SAE J3068

SAE J3068 "Electric Vehicle Power Transfer System Using a Three-Phase Capable Coupler" is a North American recommended practice published and maintained by SAE International. J3068 defines electrical connectors and a control protocol for electric vehicles. It has the formal title "SAE Surface Vehicle Recommended Practice J3068". J3068 defines a system of conductive power transfer to an electric vehicle using a coupler capable of transferring single-phase and three-phase AC power as well as DC power, and defines a digital communication system for control. J3068 also specifies requirements for the vehicle inlet, supply equipment connector, mating housings and contacts. 
History.
Initial discussions in the Electric Power Research Institute's Infrastructure Working Council meetings regarding issues related to three-phase charging in North America led to the development of J3068. There was a lack of non-proprietary, UL listed equipment that could be legally used in the United States. Some large electric vehicles were being charged without using ground fault protection, and without connectors that automatically de-enegerize when disconnected from the vehicle. 
Therefore, SAE authorized a new Task Force to develop a standard that focused on heavy and medium duty applications, and more generally any vehicle charging at commercial and industrial locations or other places where 3Φ power (three-phase) is available and preferred. Early within the development of the standard, it was decided that the J3068 connector and inlet would expand upon Europe's IEC 62196 type 2 connector also known as the Mennekes connector.
The control protocol is a variation of LIN which retains the analog voltage level signaling from SAE J1772. The positive level of the LIN signal waveform can change from 12 volts to 9 or 6 volts (known as State A, State B, and State C in J1772). An earlier version of this LIN-based control protocol was published in Annex D of IEC 61851 edition 3. Major contributors to the development of this protocol include ABB in Sweden, the University of Delaware, Vattenfall Sweden, Mack Trucks/Volvo Trucks North America and others.
SAE J3068 (2018) is written from the point of view of a developer using a commercial LIN development package with API support for LIN functionality (which is familiar to embedded controller programming teams in the automotive industry). The behavior of the EV and EVSE are described separately in terms of the signals they can see on the API. The details of how the LIN signals are sent between the EV and EVSE are assumed to be handled by commercial LIN software.
IEC 61851-1:2017 Annex D does not presume that a commercial LIN development package is used to implement the standard. It leaves the decision how to implement the standard to the developer.
Differences in logic and nomenclature between J3068 and 61851-1 Annex D are detailed in J3068 (2018) Appendix F.
North American Standards.
J3068 states that it aims to cover three-phase equipment which meets applicable North American listing standards. 
The core standards for Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in North America are tri-national standards for Mexico, Canada, and the United States. See CANENA. They are essentially equivalent documents with different names in each country. 
North American Connector.
The J3068 connector is mechanically identical to the Type 2 connector, because it makes Normative references to IEC 62196-2 and -3. Additionally, J3068 supports voltage ratings which align with North American grid voltages and EVSE standards. Unlike Europe where the most common type of three-phase Wye (3ΦY) power is nominally 400/230 VAC, in North America the three most common 3Φ voltages are 208/120, 480/277, and 600/347 VAC. 
IEC standards limit single-phase AC charging to 250 VAC (see IEC 62196-2). Three-phase EVSE and single-phase vehicles are designed to be interoperable. A 480 phase-to-phase VAC rating is theoretically allowed in the IEC document but this is mathematically incongruent with the 250 VAC single phase limit. It effectively limits the maximum 3Φ rating to 433VAC (250 * ), and means you cannot make a 480/277 VAC EVSE without exceeding the 250 VAC single phase limit. The SAE J3068 standard defines a system for nominal voltage ratings up to 600 VAC, which is also the maximum voltage rating covered by UL 2594.
Where AC voltages and current ratings exceed 250 VAC phase-to-neutral and/or 63 amps, digital communication (LIN-CP) is required. Even in the case of a North American EV designed to charge from 208/120 VAC three-phase, LIN-CP controls are required unless the EV can at least tolerate 400/230 VAC long enough to signal the EVSE to turn off the power, if it cannot actually charge from 400/230 VAC. This is because the typical European EV designed for three phase charging will be exposed to 400/230 with PWM controls, and there is no guarantee that a North American three-phase EV will not be exposed to European supply voltages if it is exported. 
UL 2594 in North America requires any EVSE that supplies more than 250 VAC be permanently wired to the electrical supply (also known as Mains electricity). In Europe, IEC 61851-1 refers to this hard-wired connection as "Mode 3". J3068 requires EV cord sets to be permanently connected to the EVSE (IEC 61851-1 calls this Case C). 
Example 1: A J3068 EVSE supplying 480/277 VAC at up to 100A is sold in the United States. The EVSE will be tested to UL2594 and the grid power will be wired directly into the EVSE. NFPA 70, Article 625, requires the breaker/fuse and wiring be sized for 125A because the load is up to 100A continuous. The vehicle cord set used will be tested to UL 2251 and be permanently attached to the station. Digital communications (LIN-CP) will check the vehicle is compatible with this voltage (480/277 VAC) and indicate maximum charge rate of 100A. 
Example 2: An imported passenger EV which only supports 61851-1 Annex A is connected to a 600/347 VAC Canadian EVSE designed to comply with J3068. The vehicle would be protected from potential damage, because the charging station would not close its internal relay. Only a vehicle which supports LIN-CP and indicates it accepts 600 VAC could use the EVSE. 
Digital Communication for AC charging (LIN-CP).
Basic AC charging is defined in SAE J1772 and IEC 61851-1 Annex A with an analog control pilot, and is used with a variety of single-phase AC grid voltages lower than 250 VAC. LIN-CP, ("Local Interconnect Network on the Control Pilot"), was originally specified in IEC 61851-1 Annex D in Edition 3. Unlike PLC over Control Pilot (IEC 15118-2), LIN CP is designed to be a low-cost digital upgrade for the analog PWM controls. 
LIN-CP is similar to the approach used by Tesla based on J2411 (Single-wire CAN), but maintains the CP voltage levels from analog PWM to be compatible with existing EVSE safety models. 
LIN transceivers used for J3068 must have an extended supply range. For example, the TI SN65HVDA100-Q1 operates from 5V to 27V. The extended voltage range is required because the LIN transceiver must operate when the Control Pilot is at 6V level (similar to "State C" in J1772).
The upcoming second edition of SAE J3068 recommends a slightly different Pilot circuit from the one defined in SAE J1772 to improve compatibility with PWM signaling. 
Compatibility.
While much of the content of the SAE J3068 document is focused on extensions for the higher voltages common in North America compared to Europe, it is noteworthy that all European Type 2 charging systems where the cord is fixed to the station are completely compatible with SAE J3068, whether DC, AC three-phase, or AC single-phase. (J3068 does not support "Case B" removable cables, because of North American regulations.) For example, any European EVSE rated for 400/230 VAC that is able to function with 60 Hz 208/120 VAC could be used in North America with no modifications. It could also be used with Buck-boost transformers to lower 480/277 VAC to an acceptable level, with no internal changes. (This may not be the most practical approach in many cases, and safety certifications for insurance coverage in North America differ from European certifications.) A J3068 EVSE that supplies only 208/120 VAC may function identically to a European EVSE. For backwards compatibility, EVs may support both J3068 controls and European analog controls unless they are unable to charge at European nominal voltages, or would be damaged by 400/230 VAC (for example, an EV that is optimized for 208/120 VAC might not be able to tolerate 400/230).
The J3068 coupler is defined by reference to the IEC 62196 specifications; there are no mechanical differences. Voltage ratings are higher, but the original coupler was designed to support North American voltages, even if the PWM controls were not. Underwriters Laboratories standards may allow certification of advanced design implementations at higher currents than the European standard, which is more conservative than other EV charging coupler current densities. For example, the European 63 amp rating for the Type 2 connector 6 mm pins equates to about 2.23 amps per square mm of cross section, while the 200 amp rating for the 8 mm DC pins (without cooling) equates to 3.98 amps/mm2. 
While J3068 focuses on AC6 charging (using the four smaller 6 mm pins), it also defines J3068 DC8 charging which is completely compatible with European Type 2 DC charging using the 8 mm pins (often referred to as "CCS" (combined charging system), although the term "CCS" is not used in the IEC standards documents). Both systems are identical, J3068 neither adds nor takes away from the existing DC charging standards, but merely references them. J3068 AC6 is fully interoperable with J3068 DC8, both systems can be implemented in the same vehicle without complication. Further, the only significant electrical difference between J3068 DC8 and J1772 DC charging is the value of the Proximity resistor. (The coupler has mechanical differences, of course.)
J3068 AC6 charging using the 6 mm pins may be implemented using older PWM controls (instead of the newer digital LIN controls) if the voltages do not exceed 433 VAC from line to line, and do not exceed 250 VAC from line to neutral. However, this may not be optimal since a system designed for 400/230 VAC in Europe will probably not deliver sufficient charging power at 208/120 VAC, which is the only common voltage that is compatible with PWM controls in North America. For this reason, J3068 is best implemented with support for LIN controls in North America. For example, a charging system on a truck which is optimized for a highest nominal voltage of 208/120 VAC three phase (see Appendix E, figure 19 on page 91 of J3068) might simply refuse to charge if it does not detect LIN controls, thereby protecting itself from possible exposure to 400/230 VAC which is common with PWM controls. Vehicles that can safely charge from 400/230 VAC and higher might support both LIN and PWM, to maximize the ability to charge at more locations.
Depending on the topology of the vehicle on-board charger, it may be possible to charge from a J1772 EVSE using an adapter. While adapters are generally discouraged, manufacturer specific adapters might be useful and are allowed in some countries according to IEC. Such an adapter shall be rated for 80 amps, as there is no practical way to signal the adapter's current rating. For example, an on-board charger configured for 480/277 which consists of three single-phase chargers wired from line to neutral, might support an adapter configured that connects L1, L2, and L3 of the J3068 together and to L1 of the J1772 input, and wires N from the J1772 inlet to N on the J3068 inlet. The vehicle must be able to detect the differences between Proximity pin resistances and must scale the current limit to 1/3 for each charger in this example. Other configurations are possible depending on the design of the vehicle charger.
Deployment example.
On 07 November 2018, Greenlots announced a project to provide charging infrastructure for all electric Volvo Trucks in Southern California. "According to Greenlots, the project will be one of the first in North America to demonstrate a new heavy-duty vehicle charging standard, SAE J3068, in real-world applications." See press release.

Gert Westphaler

Gert Westphaler or The Loquacious Barber () is a satirical play written by the Norwegian-Danish playwright Ludvig Holberg. It premiered in five sets at the Lille Grønnegade Theatre in Copenhagen on 28 October 1722 but Holberg later adapted it into a one- set version.
Reception.
Holberg comments on the reception of the play in his first Latin-language memoir from 1728: "The Loquacious Barber" displeased almost all spectators in the audience to such an extent that quite a few left before it ended, some discretely and secretly, others openly and bluntly. I had expected something else, having always loved this eye-nest of mine among my comedies.
Adaptions.
DR has produced a "made for television version" of the play that was first broadcast on 29 March 1976. It was directed by Hans Rosenquist and was starring Stig Hoffmeyer, Ruth Brejnholm, Lisbet Lipschitz]and Ejnar Hans Jensen.

Warren Foegele (born April 1, 1996) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward who currently plays with the Edmonton Oilers in the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the third-round, 67th overall, at the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.
Playing career.
Amateur.
Foegele played at St. Andrew’s College from 2011-2014, and served as an alternate captain starting in 2013. He was named a CISAA All-Star and team MVP after he helped lead St. Andrew’s College to a CISAA Championship.
Despite accepting his scholarship invitation to the University of New Hampshire, Foegele was selected by the Kingston Frontenacs in the 7th round of the 2014 OHL Draft. He ended up joining the Frontenacs while in his second year at New Hampshire, forgoing his collegiate career.
On January 2, 2017, Foegele was traded by the Frontenacs to the Erie Otters in exchange for Brett Neumann. Nearing the end of the 2016–17 season, Foegele agreed to an entry level contract with the Carolina Hurricanes who had drafted him in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft on March 31, 2017. At the end of the 2016–17 playoffs, Foegele was awarded the Wayne Gretzky 99 Award as the MVP of the 2017 playoffs.
Professional.
Carolina Hurricanes.
Foegele started the 2017–18 season with the Hurricanes' AHL affiliate the Charlotte Checkers. Foegele was named to the AHL All-Star Game after he led all rookies in goals and was tied for third in the league. Foegele was suspended for one game on March 19, 2018, for boarding during a game against the Binghamton Devils. He was called up to the NHL for the first time on March 25, 2018. Foegele played in his first NHL game the following day against the Ottawa Senators. He scored his first NHL goal and recorded his first NHL assist in his debut to help the Hurricanes win 4–1. He was sent back to the AHL after playing in two games and recording three points. Foegele was named the Checkers' Rookie of the Year following the team's elimination from the 2018 Calder Cup playoffs.
After participating at the Hurricanes training camp, Foegele started the 2018–19 season with the Hurricanes in the NHL. Foegele began the season as a winger to Jordan Staal and Justin Williams, collecting five points in the Hurricanes first seven games. However, he experienced a 27-game scoring drought following October 9, which was snapped in a 3–0 win over the Arizona Coyotes on December 16. The Hurricanes would qualify for the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs and played their first round series against the Washington Capitals. On April 18, Foegele set a new franchise record for fastest postseason goal at 17 seconds. The Hurricanes would win the game 2–1 to tie the series. On May 3, 2019, Foegele scored an assist and tied Erik Cole’s 2002 record for most points by a Hurricanes/Hartford Whalers rookie in a postseason.
After his successful rookie season, Foegele again made the Hurricanes lineup for the 2019–20 NHL season. In a 4-0 win over the Calgary Flames on December 14, he became the fifth player in Hurricanes/Hartford Whalers history to record two shorthanded goals in a game. He ended the shortened season with a new career high in goals, assists and points, ranked tied for fifth in the league in shorthanded goals. As an unrestricted free agent, Foegele signed a one year $2.15 million contract to remained with the Hurricanes for the season on November 1, 2020.
Edmonton Oilers.
As an impending restricted free agent with the Hurricanes and unable to agree to terms, Foegele was traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for Ethan Bear on July 28, 2021. He was quickly signed by the Oilers in finalising a three-year, $8.25 million contract extension on July 31.
Personal life.
Foegele was born to George and Leslie Foegele and grew up in Markham, Ontario with his older brother Reese. Reese was also an athlete; he previously played junior hockey and later lacrosse at Wilfrid Laurier University.
