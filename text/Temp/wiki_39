Sweeper (horse)

Sweeper (also known as Sweeper II, 1909 – 1923) was a French-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He showed high-class form as a juvenile in 1911 when he won the Triennial Stakes at Royal Ascot and the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood as well as finishing second in the Middle Park Plate and third in the July Stakes. In the following spring he recorded his biggest success on his seasonal reappearance when he took the 2000 Guineas. He failed when favourite for the Epsom Derby and never won again although he finished second in both the St James's Palace Stakes and the Sussex Stakes. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion.
Background.
Sweeper was a chestnut horse bred in France by his American owner Herman Duryea. Like several major American owners Duryea had moved most of his hoses to Europe following the passing of the Hart–Agnew Law. The colt was sent to England and entered training Henry Seymour "Atty" Persse at Chattis Hill near Stockbridge in Hampshire. Physically, Sweeper was described as a "golden chestnut, rather dipped in his back, but with rare limbs and a lovely action".
Sweeper was sired by Broomstick, an American horse who won the Travers Stakes in 1904 and later became a three-time champion sire. His dam Ravello was bred in England before being exported to the United States (where she was sold for 120 guineas) and producing Frank Gill, whose wins included the Travers and Withers Stakes. Ravello was a granddaughter of Genuine, a broodmare whose other descendants included Nijinsky and El Gran Senor.
Racing career.
1911: two-year-old season.
In June 1911 Sweeper was sent to Royal Ascot for the 59th Triennial Stakes and looked to be "a real flyer" as he won easily from Jaeger. At Newmarket Racecourse he came home third in the July Stakes behind an unnamed colt (later given the name "White Star") owned by Solomon Joel. In the following month the colt contested the Richmond Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was ridden by the French jockey Georges Stern and won at odds of 11/10. On 13 October in the Middle Park Plate over six furlongs at Newmarket Sweeper finished second to Absurd with White Star in third. At the end of the year he was rated the fourth best two-year-old colt in England behind Absurd, White Star and Lomond.
1912: three-year-old season.
On 1 May 1912 Sweeper started at odds of 6/1 in a fourteen-runner field for the 104th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. Ridden by Danny Maher, he settled behind the leaders as Jaeger set the pace from the favourite White Star. He took the lead two furlongs from the finish and won by a length from Jaeger with Hall Cross half a length away in third.
Sweeper started favourite for the Derby over one and a half miles at Epsom on 5 June, but never looked likely to win an finished seventh as the filly Tagalie won from Jaeger and Tracery. At Royal Ascot late in June Sweeper was dopped back in distance and started odds-on favourite for the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile but was beaten into second place by Tracery. At the same meeting he came home second behind Hector in the Triennial Stakes, with Jaeger in third place. In July he finished second by a neck to the King's colt Le Lac in the Dullingham Plate over one and a half miles at Newmarket and then finished runner-up yet again when chasing home Tracery in the Sussex Stakes at Goodwood.
On 11 September Sweeper contested the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse and rated at oddsof 12.5/1 in a fourteen-runner field. He raced just behind the leaders until half way, but then quickly dropped out of contention and finished unplaced behind Tracery.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Sweeper an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.
Stud record.
After his retirement from racing Sweeper stood as a breeding stallion in France and the United States. The most successful of his offspring was the American gelding Osmand, who won two editions of the Carter Handicap. More influential however was Ondulation, a broodmare whose descendants included Dahlia and Rail Link. Sweeper died in 1923 and his last foals were born in 1924.

Polina Strepetova

Polina (Pelageya) Antipyevna Strepetova (, born 17 October 1850, died 17 October 1903) was a Russian stage actress, renowned for her tragic parts, who provided a deep and expressive portrayal of "a suffering, protesting Russian woman."
Biography.
Born in Nizhny Novgorod, she was a foundling, raised and brought up by a city theatre barber Antip Grigoryevich Strepetov, who'd literally found the infant at his own doorstep. She's never been able to establish her biological parents' identities and accepted the day she'd been found as her birthday. Her foster mother Elizaveta Ivanovna was an amateur actress and singer who worked at the popular Shepelev Theatre, and from an early age Polina made up her mind that she'd follow her footsteps.
Strepetova started to perform at the Nizhny City theatre from age seven and was recognized as an exceptionally gifted child, but failed to receive any formal education. She made her major debut in 1865 on stage the Rybinsk Theatre and in the course of the next three years undertook more than one hundred parts, moving from one provincial city theatre to another: from Rybinsk to Yaroslavl, then Simbirsk, Murom, Novgorod, Samara, Oryol and Kazan.
She enjoyed her first success in Yaroslavl, as Lizaveta in "A Bitter Fate" by Alexey Pisemsky, then repeated this triumph in Samara, aged nineteen. Exceptionally well received here were also her performances as Verochka in "A Child" by Pyotr Boborykin and Sofia in "All Will Be Well", by Ivan Samarin. Total lack of education at that stage apparently did not bother Strepetova: she was learning fast, from her better-known colleagues, mostly Lyubov Nikulina-Kositskaya and Alexandra Schubert, as well as Modest Pisarev, her future husband. It was only in the 1880s that it became obvious that Strepetova's artistic palette was limited, and her inability to develop it or adapt to the changing public tastes started to undermine her reputation of a great actress.
Strepetova's success story continued in Kazan, where in 1871 she starred as Marya Andreyevna in "The Poor Bride", by Alexander Ostrovsky, as well as Anneta in "The Family Schemes", by Nikolai Kulikov. The latter (taken in its development over the years) came later to be regarded as her most profound achievement on stage, next to Lizaveta, which continued to be her trademark part for thirty years. Her other notable roles of the time were Liza ("Woe from Wit", Alexander Griboyedov), Dunya ("Stay in Your Own Sled") and Katerina ("The Storm"), both by Alexander Ostrovsky.
In 1873 Strepetova started to enjoy her first triumphs in Moscow where she joined the Moscow Public Theatre, ran by Urusov and Taneyev. Later, in 1880, she had a stint with Anna Brenko's Pushkin Theatre where she became the prima to a very strong troupe, but had to leave for Petersburg after the theatre went bust. Before that she became hugely popular with the Moscow artistic and literary elite, Ivan Turgenev, Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko and Pyotr Chaykovsky counting themselves among the admirers of her talent. The portraits of her were painted by Ilya Repin, Viktor Vasnetsov and Nikolai Yaroshenko. The journalist, editor and memoirist Alexandra Jacobi became a friend, and later published memoirs on Strepetova.
In 1876 she appeared on stage the Alexandrinsky Theatre for the first time, as Lizaveta again, but was invited to the troupe only five years later. Her nine year stay at the leading Imperial theatre was marred by conflicts with her more successful and versatile rival Maria Savina, petty scandals regarding wages and much intrigue on the parts of both her detractors and followers. Besides, her passionate, overemotional manner of playing was considered provincial and old-fashioned among the Petersburg theatrical society. She had more than thirty parts in Alexandrinka between 1881 and 1890, but of the 22 new ones only three were later recognized as consistent with the level of her scenic gift: Kruchinina ("Guilty Without Fault", Ostrovsky), Stepanida ("Close to the Money", Viktor Krylov) and Sarra ("Ivanov", Anton Chekhov).
In 1886 Ostrovsky, who invariably supported Strepetova in her feuds with the theatre administration, died. Unpopular with the troupe, she found herself in isolation, and in 1890 had to leave Alexandrinka. Her final success was Matryona in Lev Tolstoy's "Power of Darkness", at the Literature and Art Circle theatre, in 1895. Strepetova spent the last years of her life in Petersburg, where in 1896-1897 she played at the Maly Suvorinsky Theatre and later worked on a book of memoirs called "Minuvshiye dni" (Минувшие дни, Days Long Gone), which remained unfinished.
Strepetova died in Saint Petersburg on 17 October 1903, of stomach cancer, and was interred in the Nikolskoe Cemetery. In 1936 her ashes were relocated to the Masters of Arts Necropolis.

List of works about the Dutch East India Company

The Dutch East India Company (Verenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC) is one of the most influential and best expertly researched companies/corporations in history. As an exemplary historical company-state, the VOC had effectively transformed itself from a corporate entity into a state, an empire, or even a world in its own right. The VOC World (i.e. networks of people, places, things, activities, and events associated with the Dutch East India Company) has been the subject of a vast amount of literature that includes both fiction and non-fiction works. VOC World studies is an international multidisciplinary field focused on social, cultural, religious, scientific, technological, economic, financial, business, maritime, military, political, legal, diplomatic activities, institutional organization, and administration of the VOC and its colourful world. Some of the notable include Sinnappah Arasaratnam, Leonard Blussé, Peter Borschberg, Charles Ralph Boxer, Jaap Bruijn, Femme Gaastra, Om Prakash, Günter Schilder, and Nigel Worden.
In terms of global business history, the lessons from the VOC's success and failure are critically important. With a permanent capital base, the VOC was the first permanently organized limited-liability joint-stock company at the dawn of modern capitalism. As an early pioneering model of the modern corporation, the VOC was the first corporation to be ever actually listed on a formal stock exchange. In the early 1600s the VOC became the world's first formally listed public company (or publicly listed company) by widely issuing bonds and shares of stock to the general public. In many respects, modern-day publicly listed multinational corporations (including "Forbes Global 2000" companies) are all 'descendants' of the 17th-century VOC business model.
For almost 200 years of its existence (1602–1800), the Company played crucial roles in business, financial, socio-politico-economic, military-political, diplomatic, legal, ethnic, and exploratory maritime history of the world. In the early modern period, the VOC was the driving force behind the rise of corporate-led globalization, corporate power, corporate identity, corporate culture, corporate social responsibility, corporate governance, corporate finance, corporate capitalism, and finance capitalism. It was the VOC's institutional innovations and business practices that laid the foundations for the rise of giant global corporations to become highly significant and formidable socio-politico-economic forces in the modern world. These pioneering innovations allowed a single business enterprise like the VOC to mobilize financial resources from a large number of investors and create ventures at a scale that had previously only been possible for monarchs. The Company also played a major role in the rise of Amsterdam as the first modern model of international financial centres. With its pioneering institutional innovations and powerful roles in world history, the Company is considered by many to be the first major, first modern, first global, most valuable, most important, and most influential corporation ever seen.
In terms of military and political history, along with the Dutch West India Company (WIC/GWIC), the VOC was seen as the international arm of the Dutch Republic and the symbolic power of the Dutch Empire. The VOC was historically a military-political-economic complex rather than a pure trading company or shipping company. The Company's activities had seminal influence on the early modern history of many countries and territories around the world such as the Dutch Republic (United Provinces of the Netherlands), New Netherland (North America), Indonesia, Malaysia, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Mauritius, Taiwan, and Japan.
In the Golden Age of Dutch cartography (c. 1570s–1670s), VOC navigators and cartographers helped shape cartographic and geographic knowledge of the modern-day world. The commercial network of the VOC provided an infrastructure which was accessible to people with a scholarly interest in the exotic world. In terms of exploratory maritime history of the world, as a major force behind the Golden Age of Dutch exploration and discovery (c. 1590s–1720s), the VOC-funded exploratory voyages such as those led by Willem Janszoon ("Duyfken"), Henry Hudson ("Halve Maen"), and Abel Tasman revealed largely unknown landmasses to the civilized world and put their names on the world map. The VOC's navigators and explorers were the first non-natives to undisputedly discover, explore and chart coastlines of mainland Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, Fiji, and Tonga. Australia was the last human-inhabited continent to be methodologically explored and mapped. In the 17th century, VOC navigators and explorers charted almost three-quarters of the Australian coastline, except the east coast.
In spite of the VOC's historic roles and contributions, the Company has long been criticized for its monopoly, violence, colonialism, slave trade, exploitation (including use of slave labour), and environmental destruction. In Graham Harman's words (2016), "One of the paradoxes of the Company [VOC] is that the Dutch were the most liberal and humane nation in Europe at that time, and yet they created in the Company a very efficient monstrosity."
The Company's alternative names that have been used include the Dutch East Indies Company, United East India Company, United East Indian Company, United East Indies Company, Jan Compagnie, or Jan Company.
The following is an (incomplete) list of works relating to the history of the VOC.

2016 Laois Senior Football Championship

The 2016 Laois Senior Football Championship is the 126th edition of the Laois GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Laois, Ireland. The tournament consists of 16 teams with the winner going on to represent Laois in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship has a back-door format for the first two rounds before proceeding to a knock-out format. Generally, any team to lose two matches will be knocked out of the championship.
Portlaoise were the defending champions after they defeated Emo in the previous years final after a replay. However they lost their crown in the final this season when losing to Stradbally when a last gap goal handed them a 2-10 to 1-12 victory in O'Moore Park. This marked Stradbally's first S.F.C. title in 11 years and their 18th overall.
This was Clonaslee St. Manman's return to the senior grade after a three-year exodus since being relegated in 2012.
Emo were relegated after four years in the senior grade. Their demise was relatively surprising having only lost the Senior final the previous year, bringing Portlaoise to a replay.

2015 Kerry Senior Football Championship

The 2015 Kerry Senior Football Championship is the 114th edition of the Kerry GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Kerry, Ireland. The tournament consists of 20 teams (11 clubs &amp; 9 divisionals), with the winner going on to represent Kerry in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship, unless they are a divisional club. In this case, the winner of the Kerry Club Football Championship will represent the county. The championship has a back-door format for the first two rounds before proceeding to a knock-out format. Generally, any team to lose two matches will be knocked out of the championship.
Austin Stacks were the defending champions after they defeated Mid Kerry after a replay in the previous years final, however they lost their crown when losing to Dr. Crokes at the Third Round stage.
This was Ardfert's return to the senior grade after claiming the 2014 Kerry Intermediate Football Championship title (They also claimed the 2014 Munster Intermediate Club Football Championship and the 2015 All-Ireland Intermediate Club Football Championship. For this year they didn't supply players to the St. Brendan's divisional side.
On 22 November 2015 South Kerry claimed their 10th S.F.C. title (their first since 2009) when they defeated Killarney Legion 1-13 to 1-12 after extra time and a replay in Fitzgerald Stadium Killarney.
Kerry player Bryan Sheehan raised the Bishop Moynihan Cup for South Kerry and he also claimed the 'Man of the Match' award.
- Ardfert made the straight drop back to the I.F.C. for 2016 after spending just 1 year in the senior grade. For next years S.F.C. they will supply players to the St. Brendan's divisional side once more.
- St. Michael's/Foilmore were also relegated to the Intermediate grade after 7 years in the top flight. For next years S.F.C. they will supply players to the South Kerry divisional side.
- Laune Rangers were demoted to the middle grade after operating as a senior side for 46 years, an era which included 4 Kerry titles, 1 Munster and 1 All-Ireland title.
Format Change.
At the start of the year it was proposed by the Kerry County Committee that the number of Club teams in the Senior Championship be reduced from 11 to 9. This means that three clubs will be relegated from the senior grade in 2015 while the 2015 Intermediate champions will not be promoted to the senior grade for 2016.
It was decided that if a club team(s) got to the final of the S.F.C. they would be exempt from the relegation process (Killarney Legion).
It was also decided that the finalists of the Kerry Club Football Championship would be safe from relegation (Dr. Crokes &amp; Dingle).
Hence the number of teams competing in the S.F.C. in 2016 will be 17.

Third Schmidt cabinet

The Third Schmidt cabinet was the government of Germany between 6 November 1980 and 1 October 1982, during the 9th legislature of the Bundestag. Led by the Social Democrat Helmut Schmidt. After the 1980 federal election, incumbent Chancellor Schmidt continued the social-liberal coalition between his SPD and the FDP.
In 1982 the coalition collapsed. A first cabinet reshuffle was performed on 28 April, replacing several ministers. The split culminated in the resignation of all FDP ministers on 17 September. Schmidt briefly replaced them with an all-SPD cabinet before being voted out of office in a constructive vote of no confidence in favour of Helmut Kohl, who formed the first Kohl cabinet.

As Long as I Have You (album)

As Long as I Have You is the tenth solo album by Roger Daltrey, released on 1 June 2018.
Overview.
Work on "As Long as I Have You" was started shortly after "Going Back Home" was released in March 2014. Following his seven-month battle with viral meningitis, Daltrey planned on shelving the project until Pete Townshend heard the early mixes and expressed interest in playing rhythm and lead guitar. Recording continued during breaks on The Who's 50th anniversary tour, The Who Hits 50!
"As Long as I Have You" features Townshend's guitar on seven tracks as well as guest performances from Mick Talbot on keyboards and Sean Genockey on lead guitar.
The album is a mixture of self-penned tracks such as "Certified Rose" and the soulful ballad "Always Heading Home" along with songs that have inspired Daltrey over the years including Nick Cave's "Into My Arms", "You Haven't Done Nothing" by Stevie Wonder, Stephen Stills' "How Far" and the title track originally recorded by Garnet Mimms in 1964, the year that Roger Daltrey, Pete Townshend, John Entwistle and Keith Moon changed their name from The High Numbers and became The Who.
Release.
"As Long as I Have You" is available on a number of formats: CD, 180g black vinyl, limited 180g red vinyl housed in a Polydor disco bag, and digitally (download and streaming). All those who pre-ordered the album in any format were also entered in a contest to receive one out of ten test vinyl pressings signed by Daltrey.
Critical reception.
"As Long as I Have You" received generally positive reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 76 based on 8 reviews. Aggregator Album of the Year gave the release a 61 out of 100 based on a critical consensus of 6 reviews.

SS Lakeland

The SS "Lakeland" was an early steel-hulled Great Lakes freighter that sank on December 3, 1924, into of water on Lake Michigan near Sturgeon Bay, Door County, Wisconsin, United States, after she sprang a leak. On July 7, 2015, the wreck of the "Lakeland" was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The "Lakeland" (official number 126420) was built in 1887 in Cleveland, Ohio, by the Globe Iron Works Company as the first generation steel Great Lakes freighter "Cambria". She was originally built for the Mutual Transportation Company which was controlled by the Federal Steel Company that was owned by Elbert H. Gary. She had an overall length of , which made her the first 300-foot vessel on the lakes; she also had a length of between her perpendiculars, her beam was wide and her cargo hold was deep. She was powered by a 1,200 horsepower triple expansion steam engine which was fueled by two coal burning Scotch marine boilers. She had a gross tonnage of 1878.10 tons and a net tonnage of 1377.33 tons.
The "Cambria" was launched in Cleveland on February 1, 1887, as hull number #12. At the time of her construction she was only the second lake freighter built by Globe Iron Works Company to have a steel hull. She was also the first lake freighter equipped with a triple expansion steam engine. She was used to haul bulk cargoes such as iron ore, coal, grain, salt and later automobiles.
In June 1888 the "Cambria" ran aground southwest of Peninsula Point Light on Lake Michigan with a cargo of iron ore weighing 2,334 tons. The grounding tore a hole in her hull.
In 1910 the "Cambria" was taken to the Milwaukee Dry Dock Company to be converted to a passenger vessel, but the Milwaukee Dry Dock Company was unable to complete the conversion. Eventually the wrecking tug "Favorite" towed her to Cleveland for the conversion to be finished.
In May 1910 she was renamed "Lakeland". In September 1910 the "Lakeland" collided with the steam barge "John Smeaton" in the St. Marys River. She ran aground after the collision. In early 1920 the "Lakeland" was converted from a passenger ship to an automobile carrying vessel.
The "Lakeland" did not sail for the 1923 season because she had a major overhaul. She had her boiler room moved; she also had a brand new watertight bulkhead installed. The other new things included two new Scotch marine boilers, and a new pilothouse. She also had her ballast pump repaired, and several cracked frames replaced. In the fall of 1924 the "Lakeland" went into a dry dock in Detroit, Michigan, to have a twisted rudder stock repaired; the inspectors also examined her entire hull and her rudder.
Final voyage.
On December 3, 1924, the "Lakeland" was sailing in calm conditions across Lake Michigan from Chicago, Illinois, to Detroit, Michigan, with a cargo of 22 Nash and Kissel, and 1 Rollin automobile in her hold. She had been experiencing some minor leakage, but it was manageable. At around 11:30A.M., the "Lakeland" sprang a serious leak. When her crew discovered the leak, they tried to keep the water out of her hull by turning her pumps to their full speed; but eventually the leak got so bad that Captain John McNeely was forced to turn the "Lakeland" around in an effort to reach shallow water. When the "Lakeland" was about 9 miles from shore it became obvious that the effort to keep her afloat was futile. Some of her crew abandoned ship via the lifeboats. Eventually the "Ann Arbor No.6" came alongside the "Lakeland", but Captain McNeely allegedly refused a tow from her. By the time the coast guard arrived, the "Lakeland" was listing to port at a dangerous angle. Eventually Captain Robert Anderson ordered the remaining men on the "Lakeland" to climb onto his cutter. Meanwhile, the steamer "Signus" stood by. The "Lakeland" sank stern first and broke in two. Her lights flickered until her deck disappeared beneath the surface.
As she sank, the radio operator on the "Ann Arbor No.6", Elliot Jacobson took some photographs of her.
In mid-1925 the insurance company that owed the "Lakeland"s owners $450,000 started a search for her wreck to investigate the circumstances of her loss. Eventually the fishing tugs "Albert C." and the "Four Brothers" discovered her wreck. Technical divers using new helium and oxygen technology were the first people to dive the wreck; this was also the first time mixed gas diving suits were put to a practical test on the lakes. The divers made several dives from the deck of the steam barge "Chittendon". They made the discovery that all of the "Lakeland" seacocks had been opened prior to her sinking.
The Thompson Transportation Company, the company that owned the "Lakeland" was taken to court by sixteen insurance companies; the insurance companies tried to prove that the "Lakeland" captain scuttled her because of financial problems the Thompson Transportation Company was having. The case of her sinking went to court twice, but the insurance companies made a third attempt to take the case to court: eventually the findings went to the "Lakeland" owners. It is believed that eventually the insurance companies came to an out of court agreement with the owners of the "Lakeland".
The "Lakeland" today.
The wreck of the "Lakeland" was rediscovered in 1960. She rests upright, in of water. Her steel hull is almost broken in two aft of the cargo elevator, and her wooden deckhouses are missing. This is because when she sank, the air that trapped in the upper deck structures blew the wooden deck houses off her hull. The passenger deck on her bow has several cracks which allow divers to access her interior. In the 1970s a 1924 Rollin car was salvaged, but problems that occurred while salvaging led to the car being taken to a scrapyard. Another artifact that was retrieved was the "Lakeland" brass steam whistle which is on display in the Door County Maritime Museum. Her anchor was also salvaged. There are still Nash and Kissel automobiles in her hold. Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the large wooden bulk carriers "Australasia" and the "Frank O'Connor, the wooden steamer "Louisiana" which was lost during the Great Lakes Storm of 1913, the schooner "Christina Nilsson" and the steamboat "Joys".

Magali Herrera

Magali Herrera (1914-1992) was a Uruguayan self taught artist who wrote, danced, acted and made films in addition to producing the oeuvre of paintings of Utopias, for which she is known.
Life.
Magali Herrera was born in 1914 in Rivera, Uruguay to a notable local family. She was an autodidact who worked in a variety of media prior to creating the visual works for which she is known. She was a precocious writer of poems and stories, which were never published, and also wrote for several daily papers, working as a journalist. She enjoyed organizing poetry evenings and befriended well known Uruguayan poetess Juana de Ibarbourou She began painting intermittently in the early 1950s but it wasn't until 1965, after a period of severe depression, that she began to paint regularly. This activity became central to her existence with periods of intense creative work during which she would paint day and night. Depression, occasionally so intense that it resulted in suicide attempts, continued to plague her and in 1992 she took her own life.
Collections and exhibits.
Magali Herrera's work is primarily held in the Collection de l'Art Brut museum in Lausanne, Switzerland. Her works have been featured in Collection de l'Art Brut exhibitions including a 1996 retrospective and the "Art Brut Biennial II: Architectures", in 2015 for which an accompanying catalog of the exhibition "Architecture: Art Brut the Collection", published by 5 Continents Editions, was produced A selection of her work was presented by at the 2010 Art Paris. In 2015 her work was included in the exhibition "Le Cahier Dessiné" at the Halle Saint-Pierre in Paris.
Recognition.
In 1967, while traveling with her husband, she completed two drawings in Paris which she took to show, renowned painter and patron of many Art Brut creators, Jean Dubuffet, leaving her work with his secretary. Dubuffet immediately bought the works. Dubuffet's interest led to other purchases: the director of Plaisir de France, Claude Fregnac, bought two pieces and author Michel Tapié acquired work as well.

Israel Lund

Israel Lund (born 1980, Bellow Falls, Vermont) is a conceptual painter based in Brooklyn, New York. He creates acrylic paintings using a combination of digital and analog techniques including silk-screening; digital painting; and the manipulation of photocopies, photographs and PDFs through smartphone applications. His practice has been described as its “own distinctive kind of post-digital abstraction.”
Lund's work concerns the “modularity and scalability” of analog painting. As described by critic and art historian Alex Bacon, Lund's paintings evoke an uncanny “screen-space” that is produced in an “analog-mode” via a silk-screening process, a concept that the artist refers to as “analog.jpg”. In his recent work, this process involves imprinting the palette knife through a silk screen onto the warp and weft of raw, coarse canvas. The result is a dappled or “pixelated” miasma of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Thea Ballard describes Lund's regimented technique as “ascetic”:“This method is perhaps ascetic, following strict parameters of both process and dimension; most of his works conform to the dimensions of 8.5 x 11 inches (such economical tendencies nod to Lund’s roots in hardcore punk and zine-making). His initial experiments were rendered in black and white, but Lund also uses cyan, magenta, and yellow ink, a nod to CMYK printing, method commonly used reproduce photographs in print, in which these colors overlap to create a spectrum.” Working within a set of specific material constraints, Lund pushes painterly abstraction to its absolute limit. Ballard continues: “The canvas itself is less an endpoint than several (or maybe infinite?) portals or nodes through which these images are transferred.”
The artist's background in hardcore punk, according to Ballard, brings a sense of musicality to bear on his work: “Lund is fond of the term noise, which here stands in well for texture, inscribing the work with a dissident musicality.” Laura McLean-Ferris alternately describes this aural quality as “the snow crash of white noise.” She writes: “What the noiselike qualities of Lund’s paintings, scatterings of buzz and drag, also powerfully resist is translatability, another historic signifying system that has classically been attached to painting.”
Exhibitions.
Israel Lund's work has been shown at The Rachofsky Collection, The Warehous, Dallas; David Lewis, New York; Lumber Room, Portland; Base Arte Contemporanea Odierna (BACO) in collaboration with Galleria d’Arte Modernae Contemporanea di Bersgamo (GAMeC); White Flag Projects, St. Louis; and The Power Station, Dallas; among others.

Lund's work is featured in the collections of the Base Arte Contemporanea Odierna (BACO), Bergamo, Italy; Bienecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library, Yale, New Haven; Bowdoin College Museum of Art, Brunswick; Cincinnati Art Museum, Cincinnati; Cleveland Museum of Art; Dallas Museum of Art; Henry Art Gallery, Seattle; MoMA Library, New York; Phoenix Art Museum; Princeton University Art Museum; and the UBS Art Collection, Zürich.

Whamamerica!

Whamamerica! (also promoted as Make It Big Tour ‘85) was a concert tour by English musical duo Wham!. The tour was launched following the success of their 1984 certified multi-platinum studio album "Make It Big", which sold four million copies in the United States by the end of the year. The tour spanned nineteen days between August and September 1985, comprising nine shows across the United States and Canada.
Overview.
The Whamamerica! tour began in late August 1985. It travelled around the United States, opening at Poplar Creek Music Theater in Illinois in the Midwest, then heading across the border to Canada and all the way down the West Coast to northern and Southern California, south to Texas and then back east to Philadelphia and Detroit. Michael’s look had changed with his hair cut to a shorter length and the colour being close to his natural darker shade. He also had a new designer stubble and larger earrings, a leather jacket and fingerless gloves. Their last ever live US performance was at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit.

2018 Kerry Senior Football Championship

The 2018 Kerry Senior Football Championship was the 117th edition of Kerry GAA's premier gaelic football tournament for senior teams in County Kerry, Ireland. The tournament consists of 17 teams (8 club teams and 9 divisional teams), with the winners representing Kerry in the Munster Senior Club Football Championship if they are a club team. If the winners are a divisional team the winners of the Kerry Club Football Championship represent the county.
The championship has a back-door format for the first two rounds before proceeding to a knock-out format. Generally, any team to lose two matches will be knocked out of the championship.
This was An Ghaeltacht's return to the senior ranks, meaning they will no longer provide players to the West Kerry District panel for this season. Kilcummin (who were relegated to the I.F.C. for 2018) will provide the East Kerry Divisional side with players for the S.F.C.
Dr. Crokes were the 2017 champions after they defeated South Kerry in the final.
Format Structure Change.
8 club teams and 9 divisional teams (17 in total) will take part in this year's S.F.C. It was decided that only 8 divisional sides would take part in the competition proper so the 2 lowest ranked divisional sides from the previous 5 years would play off in a qualification match with the winner entering the draw for the 2017 County Championship proper.
Relegation (See below): The club team to be relegated from the Senior County Championship will be the same team to be relegated from the Senior Club Championship (The 8 senior clubs play off against each other in Round 1 of the Club Championship. The 4 losers enter a relegation playoff with the losers entering a relegation final. This loser will be relegated to the I.F.C. for 2017. Should a club reach the final of the County championship they will be exempt from the Relegation process in the Club championship).
The winner of the 2017 I.F.C. will be promoted to the 2018 Senior County and Club Championships.
Team Changes.
The following teams have changed division since the 2016 championship season. 
To S.F.C..
Promoted from 2017 Kerry Intermediate Football Championship
From S.F.C..
Relegated to 2018 I.F.C.
Participating Teams.
The teams taking part in the 2018 Kerry Senior Football Championship are:
Championship Qualifier.
It was decided that only 8 of the 9 Divisional Teams would play in the Senior Championship proper. To determine which team would be excluded, all divisional teams were ranked on their performances in the County Championship over the most recent 5-year period (2013-2017 inclusive). These rankings were based on a win counting for 2 points and a draw counting for 1 point.
The 2 lowest placed sides were St. Brendan's and West Kerry. These sides then met in a qualifier to decide who would make it into the championship proper. The loser of this qualifier will play the lowest ranked team on completion of the 2018 Championship, to decide the 8 divisional teams for the 2019 Championship, except in the event of more than one team giving a walk over in this year’s Championship. In that case the teams that conceded walk-overs play in 2019 Championship Qualifier.
Rounds 1 to 3.
Round 1.
The sixteen remaining teams play in eight matches in Round 1. The winners proceed to Round 2A while the losers play in Round 2B.
Round 2.
Round 2A.
The eight winners from Round 1 play each other in this round. The winners proceed to the knock-out quarter finals while the losers play in Round 3.
Round 2B.
The eight losers from Round 1 play each other in this round. The winners proceed to Round 3 while the losers are eliminated from the championship having lost two games.
Round 3.
The four Round 2A losers (who won a game and lost a game) play the four Round 2B winners (who lost a game and won a game) in this round. The four winners progress to the knock-out quarter finals while the losers are eliminated from the championship.
Knock-Out Stage.
Quarter-Finals.
The four Round 2A winners play the four Round 3 winners in the quarter-finals.
Relegation.
The club team to be relegated from the Senior County Championship will be the same team to be relegated from the Senior Club Championship. The 8 senior clubs play off against each other in Round 1 of the Club Championship. The 4 losers enter a relegation playoff with the losers entering a relegation final. This loser will be relegated to the I.F.C. for 2019. Should a club reach the final of the County championship they will be exempt from the Relegation process in the Club championship.

South Midland (Warwickshire) Royal Garrison Artillery

The South Midland (Warwickshire) Royal Garrison Artillery was a volunteer artillery unit of Britain's Territorial Force formed in 1908. It served in Home Defence and provided heavy artillery support to the armies on the Western Front and Italian Front in World War I. In the interwar years it became 204 (Warwickshire) Battery serving in various regiments and formations before being expanded into a full regiment. In World War II it served in the heavy anti-aircraft (HAA) role defending its home area of the West Midlands against German air attack (particularly in the notorious Coventry Blitz), and then defended Calcutta against Japanese attacks. It continued in the postwar Territorial Army until 1955.
Origins.
When the Territorial Force (TF) was created in 1908 as part of the Haldane Reforms, each of its infantry divisions included a heavy artillery battery in its establishment. For the South Midland Division a new battery was raised in Birmingham, under the title of South Midland (Warwickshire) Royal Garrison Artillery (RGA). The battery was equipped with four Boer War-era 4.7-inch guns. It was based at the Metropolitan Cammell Carriage and Wagon Company works at Saltley, and was organised as follows:
World War I.
Mobilisation.
The South Midland Division mobilised on the outbreak of World War I and took up its war stations around Chelmsford in Essex as part of Central Force. Shortly afterwards, TF units were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and the War Office issued instructions to separate those men who had signed up for Home Service only, and form these into reserve units. On 31 August, the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit was authorised for each 1st Line unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the original, but distinguished by a '2/' prefix. Hence the South Midland RGA formed 1/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery) for overseas service (usually referred to as 1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Battery in army documents) and the 2/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery for Home Defence and to provide drafts to the 1st Line.
1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Battery.
Western Front.
The South Midland Division was ordered to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France on 13 March 1915, and the artillery embarked at Southampton for Le Havre, the 1/1st Battery disembarking on 31 March. By 4 April the division had taken over a section of the front line near Cassel.
However, artillery policy in the BEF was to withdraw heavy batteries from the divisions and group them into dedicated heavy artillery brigades, so on 16 April the battery left the South Midland Division to join Second Army Artillery in time for the Second Battle of Ypres. At this time the practice was to move batteries between heavy brigades (later heavy artillery groups or HAGs) as required, so the 1/1st Warwickshire Bty moved to XVI Brigade RGA on 10 June, to VIII Brigade RGA on 3 July, to III Corps Artillery with First Army on 21 August, and IV Heavy Bde on 10 November.
In early 1916 the battery was moved again, to 12th HAG with Second Army (10 April), to 'Loring's Group' with I ANZAC Corps (19 May), then to 44th (South African) HAG (5 August), and on to 34th HAG (27 August), which joined Fourth Army on the Somme in September. After the Somme fighting died down, the battery moved within Fourth Army to 7th HAG (30 November) and back to 44th (SA) HAG (23 December).
By the end of 1916 the obsolete 4.7-inch gun had been largely superseded on the Western Front by the modern 60-pounder. On 28 February 1917 the battery was made up to a strength of six guns when it was joined by a section from the newly arrived 199th Heavy Bty. It then moved north on 13 March to join 15th HAG with First Army, arriving on 21 March. Soon afterwards (15 April) it was switched south again to Fifth Army where it joined 9th HAG on 20 April. Through the early summer the battery continued to be switched rapidly from one HAG to another: 42nd (arriving 19 May), 16th with Third Army (5 July), 52nd with Second Army (9 July), 99th (12 July), then back to 52nd (6 August), and finally 11th (7 September).
By now, Second Army was involved in the Third Ypres Offensive, taking the lead at the Battles of the Menin Road Ridge, Polygon Wood and Broodseinde, which were notable artillery victories. The 60-pounders were used for counter-battery (CB) fire before the attack, and then as part of the creeping barrage that led the infantry onto their objectives. However, the subsequent attacks (the Battles of Poelcappelle, First Passchendaele and Second Passchendaele) were failures. The British batteries were clearly observable from the Passchendaele Ridge and suffered badly from counter-battery fire, while their own guns sank into the mud and became difficult to aim and fire.
While the Ypres offensive was still continuing, the German and Austrian victory at Caporetto on the Italian Front led to British forces being rushed from Flanders to shore up the Italian Army. Even before their defeat the Italians had asked for the loan of heavy artillery, and now a number of units were hurriedly sent by rail, including 1/1st Warwickshire Battery, which went on 14 November.
Italian Front.
On arrival, 1/1st Warwickshire Bty joined 24th HAG (renamed 24th Bde RGA in February 1918), with which it remained for the rest of the war. The battery was the only 60-pounder unit in the brigade, the rest being the 105th, 172nd, 229th and 247th Siege Btys. By 6 December its guns went into action on the Montello Hill, supporting the Italian army, which had been critically short of heavy artillery. The situation was stabilised by the end of the year, but 24th HAG remained in Italy.
Apart from some CB shoots, there was little activity through the winter months. At the end of March 1918, 1/1st Warwickshire Hvy Bty moved to a position south of the Asiago plateau supporting VIII Italian Corps. The gunsites were in wooded mountainous terrain and the guns had to be manhandled into position. They carried out trench bombardment while awaiting the next Austrian offensive (the Second Battle of the Piave River). This finally came on 15 June. Despite some initial Austrian gains, 48th (South Midland) Division held its main positions. The British heavy batteries systematically destroyed the Austrian guns on the Asiago, notwithstanding poor visibility early on (Royal Air Force observation aircraft were able to direct the fire later) and the Austrian offensive failed all along the front.
Preparations then began for the final battle on the Italian Front, the stunning success of the Battle of Vittorio Veneto. The British were relieved in the Asiago sector and moved to join the British-commanded Tenth Italian Army near Treviso. 24th HAG supported a number of British and French raids during September and October, then on 23 October the preliminary attacks began, supported by 24th HAG's guns. The main British assault crossed the River Piave on 27 October, with the heavy guns engaging all known Austrian gun positions and providing a protective barrage on either flank. A bridge was ready by 29 October and the heavy guns crossed the river. By 1 November the Austrian army had collapsed and the pursuing British troops had left their heavy guns far in the rear. Austrian signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November, ending the war in Italy.
After the Armistice, 24th HAG was involved in securing prisoners and captured enemy guns. Demobilisation of the batteries in Italy began at Christmas 1918 and by March they were down to cadre strength. 1/1st Warwickshire Heavy Bty passed into suspended animation in 1919.
2/1st South Midland (Warwickshire) Heavy Battery.
The 2/1st Battery served in 61st (2nd South Midland) Division, first at Northampton in First Army, Central Force, then at Chelmsford when it replaced the 1st South Midland Division in coastal defence. In February 1916 the battery left the division and took over the old 4.7-inch guns of 117th Heavy Battery RGA, which was preparing to move to France. For the rest of the war 2/1st Battery served in Home Defence, from September 1916 to August 1917 with 67th (2nd Home Counties) Division at Ramsgate and Sandwich in Kent, and from January 1918 until the Armistice with the Cyclist Division at Ramsgate.
Interwar.
204 (Warwickshire) Medium Battery.
The battery was reformed on 7 February 1920 at Saltley as 204 (Warwickshire) Medium Battery, forming part of 7th (Cornwall and Warwickshire) Medium Brigade, Royal Garrison Artillery, which became 51st (Cornwall and Warwickshire) Medium Brigade, RGA when the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921. This was an awkward arrangement, Saltley being many miles from the brigade HQ at Truro and the other batteries at Padstow, Par and Penzance.
On 1 October 1932 the brigade was broken up: the Cornish elements were separated to form a new 56th (Cornwall) Anti-Aircraft (AA) brigade, while a new 51st (Midland) Medium Brigade was formed in which 204 (Warwickshire) Bty was brigaded with geographically closer batteries from Staffordshire and Shropshire.
204 (Warwickshire) Anti-Aircraft Battery.
During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of existing TA units into AA units. On 1 October 1937, 204 (Warwickshire) Bty was converted and transferred to a new 73rd Anti-Aircraft Brigade based at Wolverhampton.

On 1 April 1939 the battery was transferred yet again, this time to provide the experienced cadre for a newly formed 95th (Birmingham) AA Regiment (RA 'brigades' became 'regiments' on 1 January 1939):
World War II.
Mobilisation.
The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June, as the international situation worsened, a partial mobilisation of the TA was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA gun and searchlight positions. On 24 August, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations ahead of the declaration of war.
95th AA Regiment formed part of 34th (South Midland) AA Brigade, based at Coventry and responsible for the air defence of Birmingham and Coventry in 4 AA Division.
At that time the three heavy AA (HAA) regiments in 34 AA Bde had only 24 guns (four of them out of action) at Birmingham and 12 at Coventry. By the start of the Battle of Britain this had risen to 64 guns at Birmingham and 44 at Coventry.
From 1 June 1940, AA gun regiments manning 3-inch, 3.7-inch or 4.5-inch guns were officially designated as HAA to distinguish them from the newer light AA or LAA units that were being formed.
Battle of Britain.
Although most of the "Luftwaffe" air raids during the Battle of Britain and the early part of the night Blitz concentrated on London and the South and East Coasts, the West Midlands also suffered badly, with Birmingham and Coventry experiencing heavy raids in August and October.
A new 340 HAA Bty was formed on 1 August 1940 and regimented with 95th HAA Rgt on 25 September 1940. The regiment sent a cadre to 210th Training Regiment at Oswestry to provide the basis for a new 401 Bty; this was formed on 12 December 1940 and later joined 122nd HAA Rgt. With the continued expansion of AA Command, 34 AA Bde came under the command of a new 11 AA Division, which took over responsibility for the West Midlands on 1 November 1940.
Coventry Blitz.
The new division was still being formed when the "Luftwaffe" launched a series of devastating raids, beginning with the notorious Coventry Blitz on 14/15 November. The Coventry raid was preceded by a dozen pathfinder aircraft of "Kampfgeschwader 100" riding an "X-Gerät" beam to drop flares and incendiary bombs on the target. The huge fires that broke out in the congested city centre then attracted successive 40-strong waves of bombers flying at heights between 12,000 and 20,000 feet to saturate the defences. The AA Defence Commander (AADC) of 95th HAA Rgt had prepared a series of concentrations to be fired using sound-locators and GL Mk. I gun-laying radar, and 128 concentrations were fired before the bombing severed all lines of communication and the noise drowned out sound-location. The HAA batteries fought on in isolation. Some gun positions were able to fire at searchlight beam intersections, glimpsed through the smoke and guessing the range. Although the Coventry guns fired 10 rounds a minute for the whole 10-hour raid, only three aircraft were shot down over the UK that night, and the city centre was gutted. The Coventry raid was followed by three consecutive nights (19–22 November) of attacks on Birmingham and other Black Country industrial towns including West Bromwich, Dudley and Tipton.
The change in enemy tactics led to additional HAA guns being moved from London to the West Midlands. By March 1941, a new 67 AA Bde had been created in 11 AA Division by splitting 34 AA Bde: 95th HAA Rgt transferred to the new formation.
Birmingham Blitz.
Birmingham was bombed again during December (3, 4, 11) and on 11 March 1941, but the full Birmingham Blitz came in April 1941, with heavy raids on the nights of 9/10 and 10/11 of the month, causing extensive damage and casualties.
The Blitz is generally held to have ended on 16 May 1941 with another attack on Birmingham. By now the HAA sites had the advantage of GL Mk I* radar with an elevation finding (E/F or 'Effie') attachment, and several attackers were turned away by accurate fire and their bombs scattered widely, some on nearby Nuneaton. The city was attacked again in July, but the "Luftwaffe" bombing offensive was effectively over. The West Midlands had been the hardest hit area of the UK after London and Merseyside.
Another newly raised battery, 405 HAA Bty, joined the regiment on 5 March 1941; this had been formed on 16 January 1941 at 205th HAA Training Rgt at Arborfield from a cadre supplied by 98th HAA Rgt. 95th HAA Regiment sent a further cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt at Oswestry to form 449 HAA Bty on 12 June 1941; this joined 130th HAA Rgt
405 HAA Battery left on 2 August 1941 and joined 3rd HAA Rgt of the West African Artillery (WAA) in the Gold Coast. The battery later served in the Burma Campaign. 198 HAA Battery joined on 7 October 1941 from 122nd HAA Rgt, but its stay was short as the regiment was converted to the three-battery establishment of units deploying overseas and it transferred to 136th HAA Rgt on 4 November 1941. That month 95th HAA Rgt left AA Command and joined the War Office Reserve. Before the end of the year the regiment had embarked for overseas service with 204, 293 and 340 HAA Btys.
India.
The regiment was among reinforcements sent to India following the Japanese invasion of Malaya. It arrived at Bombay on 11 April 1942 and moved to Barrackpore outside Calcutta where it came under the command of 1 Indian AA Bde. It spent the whole of 1943 in the Calcutta area.
Calcutta was just within range of bombers operating from Burma and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service began raiding the city during December 1942, in an attempt to disrupt the operation of the docks and to create panic among the population. Attacks resumed in November 1943.
The air threat to Calcutta declined in 1944 and on 1 April 95th HAA Rgt the regiment with 204, 293 and 340 HAA Btys was 'placed in suspended animation' on 14 March 1944 and their personnel dispersed to other assignments for the rest of the war.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Sheldon as 495th (Birmingham) (Mixed) HAA Rgt, RA ('Mixed' indicating that some of its personnel were drawn from the Women's Royal Army Corps). It formed part of at Sutton Coldfield, but that formation was disbanded in September the following year.
In 1954, 495th HAA Rgt absorbed 320th (South Midland) HAA Rgt at Dashwood Heath.
When AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955, a wholesale reduction of AA units in the TA followed. 495th HAA Regiment amalgamated with 623rd (Warwick) LAA Rgt to form 443rd (Warwickshire) LAA Rgt, with Q and R Btys derived from 495th HAA Rgt. In 1961 there was another round of reductions, with Q Bty joining 268th (Warwickshire) Field Rgt and R Bty joining with part of 442nd LAA Rgt to reform 7th Battalion, Royal Warwickshire Regiment and the batteries' individual identities were lost.

Orme Wilson Jr.

Marshall Orme Wilson Jr. (November 13, 1885 – February 13, 1966) was an American diplomat and member of the Astor family.
Early life.
Wilson was born in New York City on November 13, 1885 to Marshall Orme Wilson and Caroline Schermerhorn "Carrie" Astor. He had one younger brother, Richard Thornton Wilson III, who married Florence Magee Ellsworth.
His maternal grandparents were William Backhouse Astor Jr. and Caroline Schermerhorn Astor, leader of the "Four Hundred". His paternal grandparents were Richard Thornton Wilson Sr., a banker who invested in railways following the end of the U.S. Civil War, and Melissa Clementine Johnston.
Wilson prepared at the Browning School in New York. He graduated from Harvard University in 1907.
Family.
Through both sides of his family, he was related to many prominent people. On his paternal side, his aunt Grace Wilson was married to Cornelius Vanderbilt III; his uncle was Richard Thornton Wilson Jr.; another aunt Belle Wilson, was married to the Sir Michael Henry Herbert, the British Ambassador to the United States; and another aunt, Mary Wilson, was married to New York real estate heir, Ogden Goelet. Through the latter, he was a first cousin of Mary Goelet, who married the Henry Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe and became the Duchess of Roxburghe.
On his maternal side, his aunts were Emily Astor, who married James John Van Alen; Helen Schermerhorn Astor, who married diplomat James Roosevelt Roosevelt, half-brother of Franklin D. Roosevelt; and Charlotte Augusta Astor, who married James Coleman Drayton and George Ogilvy Haig. His only maternal uncle was John Jacob Astor IV, who married socialite Ava Lowle Willing and later, Madeleine Talmage Force. He died aboard the RMS "Titanic" in 1912.
Career.
After graduating from Harvard, Wilson traveled abroad considerably and then became a "banker and manufacturer" with an office at 14 Wall Street in New York City. In 1913, he joined the firm R. T. Wilson &amp; Co., which was started by his grandfather and run by his uncle, Richard Thornton Wilson Jr., where the young Wilson became the New York Stock Exchange board member for the firm.
Following his service in the U.S. Army during World War I, Wilson began a long career diplomat with the United States Department of State. He first served in Brussels, then Berne, and in Buenos Aires, Argentina where he was second secretary and first secretary, before serving as the assistant chief of the division of Latin American affairs at the State Department.
In 1933, Wilson was made first secretary to the Embassy in Berlin. The following year, he was transferred to Prague as Consul General.
U.S. Ambassador to Haiti.
On March 21, 1944, Wilson was appointed the United States Ambassador to Haiti by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. He presented his credentials on June 2, 1944 and terminated his mission by leaving his post on August 22, 1946.
While in Haiti, Wilson was a frequent writer to Cordell Hull, the U.S. Secretary of State regarding the escalation of tensions in Haiti. Wilson recommended that unless "the Department of State views with disfavor a policy which might tend to keep President Lescot in office, there would appear to be no objection to supplying the small amount of equipment contemplated by the War Department."
Personal life.
In 1910, Wilson was married to Alice Elsie "Ella" Borland, a Brearley School graduate. She was the daughter of John Nelson Borland and the granddaughter of George Griswold Haven. Together, they had a son Orme Wilson in 1920. He served as a Foreign Service officer who served as Consul General in Zagreb, Yugoslavia; as adviser to the United States Mission to the United Nations and as political counselor to the United States Representative to NATO, and president of the Virginia Thoroughbred Association. He married Mrs. Julie Brown Colt in 1945.
Wilson was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York, the Harvard Club of New York, the Knickerbocker Club, the University Club of New York, the Automobile Club of America and the Tuxedo Club.
Wilson died in Washington, D.C. on February 13, 1966.

Diuris callitrophila

Diuris callitrophila, commonly known as the Oaklands doubletail or Oaklands diuris, is a species of orchid which is endemic to a small part of southern New South Wales. It has two or three leaves and up to nine whitish and mauve flowers with darker markings and unusually long lateral sepals.
Description.
"Diuris callitrophila" is a tuberous, perennial herb with two or three leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between three and nine white, purple or mauve flowers with darker markings, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is more or less erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are ear-like and held erect above the rest of the flower, with an elliptic blade long and wide. The petals have a dark-coloured stalk long that gradually expands towards the blade. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is fan-shaped, long and wide and the side lobes are long and wide. There are two broad callus ridges long at the base of the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in November and December.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Diuris callitrophila" was first formally described in 2003 by David Jones from a specimen collected near Oaklands and the description was published in "The Orchadian".
Distribution and habitat.
The Oaklands doubletail is only known from a few locations between Oaklands and Urana where it grows in small groups in grassy places in "Callitris" woodland.
Conservation.
"Diuris callitrophila" is classed as "endangered" under the New South Wales "Threatened Species Conservation Act". The main threats to the species are its restricted distribution and small population, weed invasion, grazing and inappropriate fire regimes. Steps are being taken to conserve the species by collecting the seed and its associated fungus, growing the orchid and reintroducing it to its natural habitat.

Isolation (Kali Uchis album)

Isolation is the debut studio album by Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis, released worldwide on April 6, 2018, by Rinse Recordings, Virgin EMI Records, and Universal Music Group. The album was supported by three singles: "Tyrant" featuring Jorja Smith, "Nuestro Planeta" featuring Reykon, and "After the Storm" featuring Tyler, the Creator and Bootsy Collins.
Recording.
In June 2018, Kali was concerned for her debut's sound, "When I was making this album, I really didn’t want to be influenced by current music or by my peers", “...I was worried that maybe my music wouldn’t be embraced by other people because it doesn’t really correlate with what’s trending at this moment, but I think embracing the isolation of that and taking the risk of making things that doesn’t sound like anything else right now makes music exciting. That’s part of what makes life exciting. That’s part of being an artist".
Music and lyrics.
In an interview with National Public Radio, Kali Uchis spoke on the details of her relationship with her family and growing up alongside the lyrics of "Killer", stating:
"After the Storm" features vocals from rapper Tyler, the Creator and singer Bootsy Collins. "Nuestro Planeta" features vocals from reggaeton performer Reykon. The song is a progressive R&amp;B and Latin pop song with a reggaeton rush, and serves as the second single for "Isolation". The silky funk song serves as the third single of the album. "The A.V. Club" describes "Body Language" as a "Smoke-ring bossa nova" song. "Miami" is a progressive Latin pop and R&amp;B song.
Release and promotion.
Uchis supported the album with her 23-date North American "In Your Dreams" tour which commenced on September 13, 2018, in Seattle and ended on November 10, 2018, in Los Angeles. Gabriel Garzón-Montano and Cuco served as opening acts for the tour.
Uchis made her television debut on The Tonight Show alongside Tyler, The Creator to perform "After the Storm".
Critical reception.
"Isolation" received widespread acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 87, based on 17 reviews. Ilana Kaplan of "The Independent" wrote that Uchis "has been largely underrated the past few years, but "Isolation" might just finally give her the attention she deserves". In a rave review for "Paste", Madison Desler stated that "for an album that's fifteen tracks to be this consistently good is ... an artistic triumph that should place it on every Best Of list at the end of the year", concluding the album "perhaps signal[s] a legend in the making." "Q" critic Rupert Howe praised Uchis' "natural pop charisma and ... ability to glide effortlessly between genres". For "Rolling Stone", Joe Levy praised the album as "fascinating" and simultaneously "vintage and futuristic", comparing it to the works of Beck and Outkast. In a five-star review Thomas Smith of "NME" commented that "miraculously, [the album] feels in no way forced: it's a joy to witness her glide into any genre and totally own it". For "Exclaim!", A. Harmony scored the album an 8 out of 10 and wrote the album "bends genres to her will rather than allowing them to absorb her identity, making for an impressive effort that will only improve as it ages."
For "Pitchfork", Julianne Escobedo Shepherd wrote that "Isolation" "positions her to become a new gravitational force in pop". "Pitchfork" also included the album at #38 on its list of 50 best albums of 2018, with Daphne Carr writing that it "pays tribute to pop’s past while making it sound new through glowing homage to black and Latinx jukebox favorites and a global roster of collaborations housed in classic soul/R&amp;B aesthetics."

Throughout 2015 to 2017 he played several previously unheard songs at live gigs to test them on a live audience, even embarking on a 16 date tour, the "Intimate and Live Tour" in summer 2016, which he described as a "warm up" for the fourth album. Describing the reasons for this he stated, "I’ve done a few live performances here and there to test out some of the new material too. I’ve found in the past that you can record an album and then tour it and wish afterwards that you’d done some of the songs differently. So this time around I’ve wanted to test the waters and perform the demos live first before making some changes. Back to front really but I’ve found it very helpful." During a gig on 18 June 2016 in Guildford he performed a new song called "Desire" for the first time, which would eventually be the lead single from the album.
It was announced on 7 November 2017 that Cardle had returned to Sony for the release of his next album, after previously being dropped by them in 2012. Speaking of the new start he said, "Signing this new deal with Sony is one of the proudest moments of my life. After the highs of X Factor I sank to the darkest places I’ve ever been. But after overcoming addiction I finally found myself in a place where I was ready and able to create the album I have always wanted to. I then spent three years pouring blood, sweat and tears plus all my darkness and my hope into this album." The song "Hallelujah" is about Cardle's experience with Vallium which he became addicted to.
On 13 March 2018, the first play of the lead single, "Desire" was played on "The Ken Bruce Show" on BBC Radio 2. On the same day it was announced the album, entitled "Time to Be Alive", would be released on 27 April 2018 and was made available to pre-order. Two further tracks, "Time to Be Alive" and "Blind Faith" were also made available to download prior to the album release.

Here Come the Aliens

Here Come the Aliens is the fourteenth studio album by English singer Kim Wilde, released on 16 March 2018 by Wildeflower Records. It is her first studio album since "Wilde Winter Songbook" (2013). It contains the singles "Pop Don't Stop", "Kandy Krush" and "Birthday", while a deluxe edition released in October housed the single "Amoureux des rêves". The album was produced by her long-time producer (and brother) Ricky Wilde. In the United Kingdom, the album became her first charting album for 25 years, peaking at number 21.
Background and release.
Wilde released her fourteenth studio album on 16 March 2018, over four years since her last. According to Wilde, the theme of the album was inspired by her seeing a UFO in her back garden in Hertfordshire in 2009. Written by her, her brother Ricky Wilde, niece Scarlett, and sister Roxanne Wilde, it was her first album to chart within the top 100 of the UK Albums Chart since 1993, peaking at number 21 during a two-week run. Elsewhere in Europe, the album reached number 10 in Switzerland, number 11 in Germany, number 34 in Austria, number 48 in Belgium, number 74 in the Netherlands and number 124 in France. In support of the album, Wilde toured the UK during March and April 2018 and later in Europe.
The album met mixed to positive reviews, with "musicOMH" saying that the album was powerful, but at times was a bit too much, stating: "...the pop machine continues churning out track after track, proving that Wilde certainly does still have a knack for writing pleasing songs. But, flowing like a thick, melodic river that threatens to drown you every so often, it borders on being too much." "The Arts Desk" said that "the production falls somewhere between Def Leppard's "Hysteria", Pat Benatar and Wilde's own early Eighties back catalogue."
A deluxe edition of the album was released in October 2018, containing two new tracks and live versions of her past singles "Kids in America", "Cambodia" and "You Came".

<doc id="56850666" url="?curid=56850666" title="Rythu Bandhu scheme">
Rythu Bandhu scheme

Rythu Bandhu scheme also Farmer's Investment Support Scheme (FISS) is a welfare program to support farmer’s investment for two crops a year by the Government of Telangana. The government is providing 58.33 lakh (5.8 million) farmers ₹5000 per acre per season to support the farm investment, twice a year, for rabi(Yasangi) and kharif(Rainy) seasons. This is a first direct farmer investment support scheme in India, where the cash is paid directly.
History.
The scheme was announced by the Chief Minister of Telangana, K. Chandrashekhar Rao at Farmers Coordination Committee (Rythu Samanvaya Samithi) conference at Jayashankar Agriculture University on 25 February 2018. An allocation of ₹12,000 crores was made in 2018-19 state budget. It was launched on 10 May 2018 at Dharmarajpalli village in Karimnagar. If a farmer has a lot of field such that they are due more than Rs. 49,000 then they get a second check for the remaining amount.
The scheme.
The scheme offers a financial help of ₹10,000 per year to each farmer (two crops). There is no cap on the number of acres, and most of the farmers are small and marginal. The total farming land is 1.43 crore acres and the number of farmers in the state stood at 58.33 lakh. Around 55% of population in Telangana make a living from agriculture.
The agriculture land holdings are:
Land ceiling &amp; Tenancy.
As per AP Land Ceiling Act 1976, any person cannot hold more than 51 acres agriculture land and 21 acres dryland. Tenant farmers were excluded from the scheme to prevent legal disputes arising out of tenancy (Hyderabad Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act, 1950). To prevent legal disputes, the tenancy column was removed from the newly issued Pattadar Passbook.
Give it Up! Option.
The Chief Minister was the first farmer to forgo the support called as, Give it up!, given by the government and appealed to all rich farmers to do the same. The farmers who forgo the support, the money goes to the corpus of Rythu Samanvaya Samithi corpus.
Distribution.
The money is given to the farmers through a bank bearer cheque. The Agriculture Extension Officers (AEO) will supervise the Rythu Bandhu cheques distribution at village level. They make entries cheque details on a tablet computer provided to them for easy monitoring.
New Pattadar Passbook.
Along with the cheque, the government is also giving the new Pattadar Passbook, the title deed after an exercise to purify the land records was done by the government. The new passbook is highly secure with 17 tamper-proof security features, and a land bank website, Dharani, to have all land holdings in the state.
Monitoring.
A special dashboard software is being developed by the NIC to monitor the scheme remotely. The sample for the research is selected through random sampling.
Misuse.
The scheme pays all land owners regardless of their personal income and wealth. Much of the opposition to the scheme is directed towards payments to rich land owners. Many wealthy individuals such as government officials, doctors and businessmen etc. are known to own large tracts of farmlands. In contrary to the scheme's intention all such individuals are paid the scheme benefits. According to the government's estimates about 319 crores is paid annually to farmers who own more than 20 acers. However the estimate doesn't take in to consideration the practice of splitting the land between members of the same family in order to show smaller land holding.In addition, the scheme only pays the land owners and not the tillers.
Oftentimes rich land owners lease their lands to poor farmers for cultivation. In recent times the practice of land leasing is increasing substantially due to scarcity of farm labor. Rich land owners unwilling to do the hard work are leasing their lands to hardworking poor tillers. However, the tillers don't get any benefit from the scheme, defeating its purpose. Besides, the scheme is known to pay for lands that are not in cultivation such as lands converted for real estate or other commercial purposes. 
The political opposition often criticized the state government for its failure to curb the misuse of the scheme. 
Annadatha Sukhibhava.
Annadatha Sukhibhava (అన్నదాత సుఖీభవ ) is a welfare program started by Andhra Pradesh Government to provide ₹15,000 investment support to small and marginal farmer’s family per annum which includes ₹6000 Central Government Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi share. The government is providing support to nearly 70 lakh farmers including tenant farmers. This farmer investment support scheme where the cash is paid directly into the Aadhaar linked bank accounts will cover all the farmers in the state on Family as unit basis without any conditions. It was formally started on 19-02-2019 by providing ₹1000 Initially by RTGS Center.
MIT study.
MIT’s Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL), a poverty alleviation institute. It is conducting the study for randomly selected sample and is using High-frequency monitoring in-Person Phone Survey and IVR based survey on the effectiveness of the scheme. A 40-member team of professors is carrying out the calls.

Xi'an began its metro system plan in the mid-1980s. The plan was first submitted to the State Council in 1994, with four planned lines and a total length of . In February 2004, the re-drafted plan was submitted to the State Government, which received final approval on September 13, 2006.
The first line, Line 2, began construction along Chang'an Street on 29 September 2006 and was completed in 2011. It runs north-south and passes under such historic sites as the Bell Tower and city wall. It is long with lying underground, approximately 20 meters below the surface. It is estimated to have cost 17.9 billion yuan (US$2.24 billion). The route stretches from the Beikezhan to Weiqunan with 20 stops.

Russia at the World Athletics Championships

Russia competed at every edition of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics 1993 to the 2017 World Championships, from which its athletes have been banned from competing as Russian. In order for Russian nationals to compete at the World Athletics Championship (from 2017 on), they must be approved as authorised neutral athletes by the IAAF. Prior to 1993, Russian athletes competed for the Soviet Union. Russia has the second-highest medal total among nations at the competition (153), after the United States. At 47 gold medals, it holds the third-highest total after the United States and Kenya. It has had the most success in women's events and in field events. As a major nation in the sport of athletics, it typically sent a delegation numbering over 100 athletes.
It topped the medal table at the 2001 tournament, overtaking the United States following the redistribution of medals due to doping cases. Russia also finished top of the medal table at the 2013 Moscow Championships, but lost this position due to doping disqualifications of its athletes. Russia's performance at the competition has been strongly affected by doping. Furthermore, the country's doping problems are distinct because in Russia doping is supplied to the athletes by the government. The country was banned from competing in 2017 due to the state-sponsored doping and Russians had to gain special dispensation to compete as Authorised Neutral Athletes. Various members of the Russian delegation have been banned for doping at every edition of the competition it has competed at, with the exceptions of 2003 and 2015 (though Russian medalists in both those years were subsequently banned).
Russia's most successful athlete at the competition is horizontal jumps specialist Tatyana Lebedeva, who between 2001 and 2009 won two triple jump gold medals, a long jump title, and two further silver medals. Women's pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva has also won three gold medals, in addition to a bronze. Yuliya Pechonkina, a 400 metres hurdles and relay athlete, has won the most medals for Russia, with her total of seven. The most successful Russian man at the World Championships is high jumper Yaroslav Rybakov, who won three high jump silvers before becoming champion in 2009.

Fourth Adenauer cabinet

The Fourth Adenauer cabinet (German: "Kabinett Adenauer IV") was formed by incumbent Chancellor Konrad Adenauer after the 1961 federal election. The cabinet was sworn in on 14 November 1961.
The Spiegel affair in 1962 caused the coalition to fall apart over Defence Minister Franz Josef Strauss' actions which violated press freedom, leading to all FDP ministers resigning in protest. As a result, the cabinet was a minority government of the CDU/CSU for just under a month in the fall of 1962 before Adenauer was able to convince the FDP to return to the coalition by assuring Strauß' resignation.
Composition.
Shortly after the Spiegel affair, the resignation of Defence Minister Franz Josef Strauss was required to gain back the FDP's support for the cabinet, leading to a reshuffle. The heavily reshuffled cabinet is sometimes referred to as cabinet Adenauer V; however, this is not constitutionally correct, since no new election of the chancellor took place. The government still drew its constitutional legitimacy from Adenauer's election on 14 November 1961. Adenauer decided to retire just a few months later, following which Ludwig Erhard was elected as Chancellor and formed the first Erhard cabinet on 17 October 1963.

Future Brown (album)

Future Brown is the self-titled debut studio album by American electronic music supergroup Future Brown, consisting of Fatima Al Qadiri, J-Cush, and members of the duo Nguzunguzu (Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda). "Future Brown" is an electronica album fusing together genres from a variety of different cultures and backgrounds. It features several rappers and musicians also associated with from a diverse set of music scenes such as Kelela, Tink, Riko Dan, Maluca, Shawnna, 3D Na'Tee, Tim Vocals, and Ruff Sqwad members Dirty Danger, Prince Rapid, and Roachee.
Released by Warp Records in February 2015, "Future Brown" received generally positive critical reviews and landed on the year-end lists of publications such as "PopMatters", "Exclaim!", and "Mixmag". However, the LP's critical reception also garnered controversy, as Future Brown lambasted some reviewers for suggesting that the group intended to have art school-level concepts behind the album.
Background.
Fatima Al Qadiri and Asma Maroof were the first to notice that they, Daniel Pineda, and Jamie Imanian-Friedman (J-Cush) had all been working together on various solo projects. Qadiri and Maroof had thought about working together in person for a year after meeting on the internet, "and me and Jamie had just hatched the idea to start working together, so we just had a very quick conversation about why is this happening, and that we should all work together," explained Qadiri. Future Brown started sketching songs in early 2013 in a studio in New York City. Uno Recordings leader Charles Damga was responsible for investing both a studio pace and vocal features for "Future Brown". 90% of the songs were done by the group together in person, Qadiri explaining that "only minor editing has been done over the internet or remotely." Only roughly half of the album's featured guests recorded in the studio. These included American rapper Tink, who appears on two tracks on the album, "Room 302" and "Wanna Party," and had vocals for both of the tracks be tracked in Future Brown's studio all in around two hours.
Composition.
"Future Brown" employs what "The Fader" described as "raucous club rhythms, graceful melodies, icy synths, and enchanting percussive licks" that "call out to different corners of the planet." The LP contains many signature aspects of the works of Qadiri and Nguzunguzu, including "hushed synthesizers, tropical percussion inflated with reverb and a sense of space that leaves the spotlight on the guest artists," wrote Andrew Ryce. As "Crack Magazine" categorized "Future Brown", the group follows a hybrid of styles that "exists through a constant traffic of ideas but arrives [on the album] in the fashion that all things do in the online age: compressed, compact and finite. The nucleus of the album is a hyperreal, glossy presentation of hybridised club sounds in various contemporary mutations."
Labeled by Colin Fitzgerald as "richly textured and cleanly mixed," the record has what some critics described as a futuristic science fiction sound that is "counterpoint[ed]" by its lyrical content about partying, Killian Fox of "The Observer" wrote. Critic Calum Slingerland wrote that the record's clean sounds and minimal arrangements were the most similar to those on Qadiri's debut full-length album "Asiatisch" (2014). A "HipHopDX" review by Bryan Hahn analyzed the music having a "cold, metallic vibe" where "most of the sounds used would be nearly impossible to recreate with acoustic instruments, giving you a feeling of distant familiarity at best."
In addition to lyrics about sex and getting drunk usual for party music, "Future Brown" also deals with serious subject matter. "Asbestos" is a song about racism, where grime rapper Dirty Danger says that because his "jeans low and my face too black," he's unable to appear on "The X Factor". "No Apology" deals with female empowerment, while on "Vernáculo," Maluca raps about resistance against the upper class in terms of language, where she rhymes the Spanish word culo with vernáculo.
The music follows a European electronica fusion of multiple genres from a variety of nations and cultural backgrounds, including grime, kuduro, dancehall, reggaeton, drill, bop, footwork, industrial noise, bass, and cumbia. The lyrics feature lines in languages such as English, Spanish, and Japanese as well as various regional dialects and accents such as American, British, and Jamaican. The record's set of collaborators include reggaeton acts and rappers mostly from Chicago and London. This has led multiple reviews to mislabel the LP as a pro-cultural-diversity album (see controversy section).
Release and promotion.
On August 2, 2013, the website of "Complex" magazine premiered Future Brown's first single, "Wanna Party," which landed at number 26 on a list by "Fact" magazine of the best tracks of 2013. A remix of "Wanna Party" featuring 3D Na'Tee, Future Brown's first release for Warp Records, was distributed on September 16, 2014 via streaming and issued to digital and vinyl formats on November 3. Future Brown wanted to sign with Warp because of the album's big production budget. Imanian-Friedman said in an interview, "Warp were very experienced: they understood what we were trying to do and weren't trying to alter our vision in the slightest, which is really just what we were looking for."
The video for "Vernáculo" was first presented at the 2014 Art Basel Miami Beach event held by Pérez Art Museum Miami, which lasted from December 4 to December 5, 2014, and then released online on December 17, 2014. Described by the museum's official website as an "exercise in capitalist surrealism," the video "appropriate[s]" methods of advertising used by companies such as L’Oreal and Revlon as a way to commentate on fake standards set by beauty product commercials. "Future Brown" was also promoted with two other pre-album track releases, "Talkin Bandz" on December 4, 2014, and "Room 302" January 8, 2015. NPR Music premiered "Future Brown" via streaming on February 15, 2018 before Warp released it to other formats on February 23, 2015.
Critical reception.
Hahn placed a majority of the praise on "Future Brown"'s dynamic and unique production. He wrote that it contained "strange, new sounds" that "challenge what perceptions you may have had of the vocalists," and each instrumental is "constantly evolving, swelling and shrinking, to complement the vocalists’ acoustics. [...] Not only do they know that less is more, they know when to execute it." He also complemented how diverse the set of featured vocalists were, noting that they gave the album the feel of "a personal mixtape that four friends put together for your own enjoyment." "Now" magazine favorably compared "Future Brown" to the mixtape "Cut 4 Me" (2013) by Kelela (who also features on "Future Brown") for its combination of elements of experimental and pop music: "Future Brown unabashedly push the needle forward on stark "post-Timberland" production values by ceding the floor to a worldwide underground of vocalists [...] whose hooks, melodies and attitude give the music a familiar shape."
"The 405" praised "Future Brown" for "highlight[ing]" the LP's featured artists of many different genres "rather than attempting to sand down everything to find common ground." Slingerland wrote that the album's musical variety "gives the record's impressive roster of vocalists plenty of space to work with, ranging from the smoothest of soul singers to the sharpest emcees," also writing that "the diversity of "Future Brown" never once feels overwhelming, making the trip through these sounds from a futuristic dance floor satisfying throughout." Irish critic Jim Carroll described it as "an album full of smart ideas, genre hopscotching and next- level brainstorming. The constant ducking and diving between hip-hop, dancehall, grime, r’n’b and electronica results in an imaginative rush of sound." "Spin" described it as "a collection with the thinnest of underlying threads to keep things from falling apart, each track standing completely apart from the rest."
Ryce wrote that the "group's individual backgrounds blend together like watercolour paints, creating a consistent, adaptable style that works well across such a wide spectrum of sounds." He also found "Future Brown" superior to most records that are heavy on collaborations in that "the group take the time to understand and mold to the artists they're working with." Colin Fitzgerald stated in his review of the album, "Unlike most supergroups of years past, Future Brown fulfill all the criteria for success: originality, intellectual and commercial value, and a healthy predilection for the familiar." He noted that the record's wide range of stylings and sounds "easily coalesce, and the record feels expansive and worldly as a result." However, he also noted that a few of the tracks were "sterile and shallow" because they "reveal how thin Future Brown’s methodology actually is when the novel elements don’t come together."
"The Guardian" claimed that the featured artists "display an intensity and character that is absent from the music," summarizing, "Every track on Future Brown is expertly constructed and polished, but rather than an exhilarating modern collaboration, it sounds like a curated exhibition." AllMusic claimed that, despite encompassing a wide variety of guest acts and genres, "Future Brown" was "stilted and clinical." A critic for "Pretty Much Amazing" opined that while "certain tracks on the album illustrate the kind of promise you’d expect from four of the world’s most eclectic production entities," the album suffered from a lack of "direction" and occasionally being "so derivative it’s infuriating."
Controversy.
Because of "Future Brown"'s globally-tinged styles, multi-lingual lyrics, and featured artists of various genres, multiple written pieces about "Future Brown" described it as a pro-cultural-diversity album. "The Fader" claimed the record challenges the existence of "English being the predominant language of popular music" and the amount of white male electronic music producers. Journalist Jazz Monroe analyzed "Future Brown" as having a "transcultural discord," where it "toys with an unconscious web of associations, partly generated by our casual consumption of cross-continental music." Fitzgerald described the musical content as "the manifestation of our post-modern obsession with a universal social uplink, a record prophetic of a global future where world cultures converge and evolve as one, thereby representing the progressive ideals of contemporary life."
Writer Alex Macpherson, however, opined the album actually appropriated musical styles in a negative review of "Future Brown" for Red Bull Music Academy titled "Is Future Brown’s Shtick 4Real?," which was published on February 17, 2015. Both Macpherson's review and an article for "Pitchfork" by writer Meaghan Garvey suggested "Future Brown" had art school-level concepts behind it and criticized the album based on that. While Garvey acknowledged that Future Brown claimed themselves to be "a free-form, vibes-based passion project, steered by the unrestricted contributions of the featured collaborators as much as the producers’ whims," both reviews used the album's promotional material (particularly the music video for "Vernuculo"), the group members' previous experiences in the modern art community, and the fact that postinternet art magazine "DIS Magazine" was responsible for the cover art as evidence the LP was something more than that.
Macpherson suggested the band intended to make a record promoting "cultural hybridity, to make, so says their press release, “connections between global street sounds”," and that "articles about them tend to reel off the names of these global genres in an awed tone – footwork, cumbia, reggaeton and grime, among them." He criticized the instrumentals for being "weirdly detached, uncanny-valley version[s]" of these styles: "[Future Brown's] relationship to both these genres and the guest appearances brought into the fold is a top-down one rather than ground-level; no wonder these beats sound so pristinely lofty juxtaposed with their vocals." He also battered the quartet for using art school-level ideas to gain a huge amount of attention from the press, given that the LP's featured artists had been receiving far less popularity: " This is both telling with regards to issues of class and privilege, and also an immense shame. [...] Future Brown has failed to recognise their collaborators as innovators of long standing in their own right." Garvey wrote that "it’s about everything and nothing, partying and post-postmodernism, global street music and the New York art world, commodity fetishism and basketball," but these concepts were unidentifiable when listening to the music itself, and the songs are actually "weirdly unremarkable."
Garvey and Macpherson's reviews of "Future Brown" garnered negative attention from members of Future Brown as well as several readers, "Dummy" claiming that they "rippled fast and divisive through the caverns of music Twitter." The band claimed that they weren't making "Future Brown" based on a high-level thesis. Al Qadiri called the reviews "attacks" in a Facebook post, reasoning that they were "proliferating theories and false notions of a malicious nature that have no factual bearing." She summarized the following: "Writers who see fit to assert a theory or thesis on behalf of an artist when there isn’t one, or posit a privilege or claim of appropriation without access, proof or knowledge, create a hostile environment for artists and readers who demand credible journalism, filled with genuine criticism and facts, good or bad." In a 2015 interview with Future Brown, "Dummy" asked questions about sources stating the album was appropriating foreign musical styles. J-Cush said that he was frustrated by the responses, reasoning that the group simply wanted to "bring people together on a record and make something special." He also had a reason for the album's accidental appropriation: "When you're making music and thinking about who you want to spit on the tune, that affects what comes out. If you wanna have somebody like Riko or [Prince] Rapid or Skepta come do a tune, you should think about how they're gonna fit on it."
"Stereogum" sided with the reviewers in this conflict, reasoning that "[The critics] seems correct in [their] assertion that Future Brown, not the critical community, are the ones who affixed high-concept baggage to their music via Art Basel exploits and loaded graphic design." The source also stated, "musicians don’t get to dictate how their music is perceived, and human beings in general aren’t always aware of how they might strike other people." Tim Wilson of "The Ransom Note", on the other hand, stated that while the modern art associations with Future Brown were "unavoidable," an album "should be judged on its own merits and underpinnings, not past or peripheral ones." Wilson stated Future Brown were not entirely to blame for their appropriated representations of other styles, nor for the lack of success of the featured artists: "The collective have previously revealed that the project comes with no manifesto and all of the collaborations were conducted in a studio. It doesn’t appear that the collective remained anonymous, lofty outsiders to those involved [...] Macpherson and Garvey should look to critiquing the prejudices of their colleagues before firing barbs at young bands."
Because Red Bull Music Academy had a long previous history of promoting members from Future Brown, the publication had to remove Macpherson's review from the website by having the link for it redirect to a positive interview with the group. Gawker writer Jordan Sargent claimed it to be an example of issues that result from most music publications developing "coherent, identifiable taste, which becomes a problem when artists you once stumped for begin to suck." He reasoned that "artists are the ones who, theoretically, attract readers. So while most editors and writers would love to write as bluntly as possible about the music they cover, the truth is that the health of every magazine and website depends, to varying degrees, on which artists—and PR firms and labels—feel comfortable enough with your coverage to continue to play ball."
Track listing and personnel.
All songs written and produced by Future Brown, recorded at The Space Pit in Brooklyn, Shelter Studios in Perth, and Nguzunguzu Studios in Los Angeles, mixed by Chris Tabron at Red Bull Studios in New York City, and mastered by Dave Kutch at The Mastering Palace in Manhattan. Co-production on "Wanna Party" by Mike Q. Additional writers and vocal mixers are noted.

Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences

The Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences was an encyclopedia edited by Thomas Henry Croker. It is notable for being published in Coventry – the first English encyclopedia published outside London.
Publication began in April 1765 with the issuance of the first of what were eventually 150 three-page sheets that were eventually collected into a folio dated 1764–1766.
Other contributors included Thomas Williams who provided articles on medicine, anatomy and chemistry, and Samuel Clark who provided articles on mathematics. Nevertheless, the work was largely a plagiarization of Ephraim Chambers' "Cyclopaedia, or a Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences".

Hotel George (Lviv)

Hotel George is a hotel located in Lviv, Ukraine that was built in 1899-1900 and opened in 1901. It was designed by the Fellner &amp; Helmer architecture studio.
History.
The history of the hotel dates back to 1793 when an inn was constructed on the site. In 1811 it was replaced by a new building called "Russie Hotel", a three-story hotel with two entrances. On the Chorążczyzna Street (now Tschaikowski Street) there was a large garden. The hotel was taken over in 1816 by the Lviv merchant, George Hofmann (1778-1839), whom the hotel was named after. It was demolished in 1899. The new building was constructed from 1899 to 1901 by Fellner &amp; Helmer, with participation of the Lviv architects Iwan Lewiński and Julian Cybulski.
The new hotel was inaugurated on January 8, 1901. At the time, it had 93 rooms, including 32 luxury-class rooms. The hotel was extended by two floors in 1906. From 1910 to 1912, it housed Alfred Altenberg's bookstore on the ground floor. The hotel was completely renovated in 1927, and a fifth floor was added. In 1932 the reading room and restaurant were modernized by Tadeusz Wróbel. During the Soviet rule from 1939 to 1941 and from 1944 to 1990, it was administered by the Soviet travel agency.
Among notable guests who stayed at the hotel, Honore de Balzac, Ethel Lilian Voynich, Franz von Liszt, Maurice Ravel, Jean-Paul Sartre, Leonid Brezhnev, and Józef Piłsudski.
Architecture.
The building is made of brick, with a high mansard roof. The original building had a dominant Italian Renaissance style, but through renovations over decades, it had added elements of Art Nouveau and Art Deco. In the niches there is sculptures of The Four Continents, a work by Leonard Marconi and Antoni Popiel that represents Africa, Asia, Europe, and America. The main façade shows a bas-relief of the original owner George Hofmann, a work by Popiel.

Double Bedroom Housing scheme

Double Bedroom Housing scheme or 2BHK scheme is a housing project created by the Government of Telangana. The scheme aims to make the city of Hyderabad a slum-free city by providing government funding for housing in rural and urban areas. The plan provides 2.72 lakh by March 2019, followed by an additional 3 lakh by 2024.
History.
The scheme was announced in the election manifesto of Telangana Rashtra Samithi, in May, 2014. 5.72 lakh houses were to be allotted to the poor across the state, including 2 lakh houses in Hyderabad. The pilot project for double bedroom houses was built at Erravalli on 5 March 2016. The villages adopted by the Chief Minister are located in Jagdevpur mandal, Medak district.
Scheme.
The scheme started pilot projects across the state. Applications are submitted either online at Mee Seva, or its centers. In Hyderabad, the slums to be cleared have been identified and residents are relocated for the construction. In some areas, government-owned land is identified and houses are built there. 
After the construction is completed, the house is transferred and registration is done in the beneficiary's name by the government.
2 BHK house.
2 BHK houses built in rural areas are on a 200 square yard plot. The structure comprises 560 square feet. They have two bedrooms, a kitchen, hall and two bathrooms. In urban areas, projects are Ground +3 floor apartments. In GHMC areas, Ground +9 floor apartments are constructed.
Tunnel form technology.
To expedite the construction of 6,240 2 BHK houses at Rampally and 15,660 houses at Kollur, the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation applied advanced tunnel form technology for the first time.
Cost escalation.
The cost was estimated in the manifesto in 2014 to be ₹3.5 lakhs per house, but escalated to ₹7.5 lakhs by 2017 due to design upgrades and increases in material costs. An additional ₹1.25 lakhs per house goes for amenities, roads etc.
The government struck a deal with cement companies for a below market rate as a social responsibility, and paid the bills online. Steel prices increased three times over two years. Free sand for concrete is supplied by the government.
Status.
By March 2018, of the 2.72 lakh targeted houses, 9500 were completed, and 169,000 houses are in advanced stages of completion at a capital outlay of over ₹18,000 crores.

Green Line (Calgary)

The Green Line is a light rail transit (LRT) megaproject planned to run between north-central and southeastern Calgary, Alberta, Canada. When completed, it will be the third line in the CTrain system and will be known as Route 203, connecting with the existing Red Line and the Blue Line in Downtown Calgary. The Green Line is the largest public infrastructure project in the history of Alberta and is three-and-a-half times bigger than the second-largest project. It will be the first rail line in Calgary to operate low-floor trains. 
When completed, the Green Line will comprise 29 stations spanning 46 kilometres. Like the Red Line and Blue Line, the Green Line will be built in stages. Stage one of construction will feature 15 stations (9 at-grade, 4 underground, 2 elevated) and was funded and approved by Calgary City Council on June 16, 2020. Major construction was planned to begin in early 2021 but was delayed to late 2021 after the United Conservative provincial government failed to contribute their pledged portion of the line's funding and rebuked the project as a "line to nowhere" and said the City of Calgary did not have "any credible plan". This came after months of speculation from city officials, politicians and journalists that the provincial government, oil tycoons and other executives associated with the United Conservative Party were attempting to stifle or cancel the Green Line despite its popular support. Due to the provincial government's actions, the City of Calgary temporarily paused the project's procurement though planning, pre-construction and public engagement continued. On May 25, 2021, the City of Calgary announced construction would begin Autumn 2021, starting with the Beltline segment of the line, segment 2A. The city selected PCL Construction as the construction management contractor. The project received final approval from all three orders of government on July 7, 2021 and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later said "The money is there and the agreements are signed, so regardless of an election, the Green Line is going to go forward." Stage one of construction is expected to be completed in 2027. 
Description.
The Green Line will be an urban and suburban light-rail line using low-floor trains, integrated as part of Calgary's CTrain system. Like the rest of Calgary’s rail transit network, the Green Line will be entirely powered by renewable, wind generated electricity. Operation of the line will be publicly funded by municipal taxation along with rider fares, and will be administered by Calgary Transit. Generally, stations will be smaller and less elaborate than existing CTrain stations, due to the use of low-floor trains. The southeast segment of the line will run similarly to the existing Red Line and Blue Line, with dedicated tracks, bells and gates on at-grade crossings and free standing stations. The track between 26 Avenue SE Station and Ramsay/Inglewood Station is then elevated on a guideway similar to the existing Sunalta Station. The line is then completely underground with four underground stations through the Beltline, the Centre City, and Eau Claire. The underground segment begins at a tunnel portal at 11 Avenue and 6 Street SE adjacent to the Victoria Park Bus Garage. It will enter the Beltline in a shallow tunnel below 11 Avenue SE, stopping underground at 4 Street SE and Centre Street South stations before reorienting northward and entering the centre city under 2 Street SW. The train then stops underground at 7 Avenue SW Station in Calgary’s urban core, providing direct transfer to the existing Red Line and Blue Line. The train will continue north, stopping underground at 2 Avenue SW Station in Eau Claire, exiting at a tunnel portal integrated into the Eau Claire Market, which will be redeveloped similar to the Central Library to accommodate the train. Then, an elevated guideway with two multi-use pathways will take tracks to Centre Street, north of the Centre Street Bridge. The train will then run northward in the centre two lanes of Centre Street in a dedicated right of way, leaving two lanes for car traffic south of McKnight Boulevard and four lanes north of McKnight Boulevard. The train will run without gates, bells or fences on most at-grade crossings along Centre Street. The train will continue northward, tracks will eventually enter into the median of Harvest Hills Boulevard, and the line will eventually span north of Stoney Trail into the outer suburban community of Keystone. 
Stations and route.
The line will run from north-central to southeast Calgary on 46 kilometres of track and will feature 29 stations. This will bring the total number of CTrain stations in Calgary to 74. The planned Green Line corridor is currently served via three bus rapid transit (BRT) routes: Route 300 (operating the Calgary International Airport and downtown, primarily along Centre Street), Route 301 (between North Pointe and downtown) and Route 302 (between Seton and downtown). Like the Red Line and Blue Line, the Green Line will be built in stages. Stage one of construction will extend from 16 Avenue North at 16 Avenue N Station, through downtown Calgary, to 126 Avenue SE at Shepard Station.
Stage one of construction will be built incrementally in three smaller segments:
Expansion timeline and funding.
Though the alignment and general design of future expansions have been approved by city council, the timeline and funding of future extensions has not yet been determined. Construction stage one builds the most complex and the most expensive segment of the line first - allowing incremental, relatively simple expansion of the line as funding becomes available. The full build-out of the line is estimated to require an additional CA$2–3 billion. In 2019, several potential stage two build-outs were evaluated for variable amounts of potential future funding. These were:
Additional infrastructure.
When completed, stage one of the Green Line will feature:
When the full line is complete, it will also feature 12 bridges, 10 park and ride facilities (with 5,000 to 6,000 parking stalls), 10 tunnels (including the -long centre city tunnel from 2 St SW in Eau Claire to Olympic Way SE in Victoria Park, a bridge connecting Eau Claire to Centre Street North, and 2 LRV maintenance and storage facilities (at Shepard and 96 Avenue N).
Impact.
The megaproject is expected to have far-reaching impacts to the mobility, economics and quality of life of hundreds of thousands of Calgarians. The Green Line will be entirely powered by wind generated electricity, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 67,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, equivalent to 14,200 fewer vehicles on Calgary's roadways. This saves 22 million litres of gasoline and diesel fuel yearly and reduces city-wide smog by 2%. Deerfoot Trail is currently the primary transportation route from north-central to southeast Calgary. It is the busiest freeway in Alberta, and suffers from chronic congestion. Calgarians spent an average of 15.7 hours in peak hour congestion in 2016. The Green Line alignment runs adjacent to Deerfoot Trail and is expected to be a catalyst for reducing traffic on the arterial route, as well as having impacts on traffic city wide. The completed Green Line will reduce city-wide congestion by 10-15% and reduce total vehicle kilometres traveled by up to 40%. Additionally, the line will reduce travel times for existing north-central BRT and southeast BRT riders by an average of 25 minutes. Centre Street between 9 Avenue N - McKnight Blvd will be reduced to two lanes for vehicle traffic, converting the road from an arterial through-road to a local street. Those wishing to travel between downtown — McKnight Blvd using Centre Street will be encouraged to ride the CTrain, or take alternate routes such as Edmonton Trail or 14 Street NW. The line will contribute towards Calgary's economic recovery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by generating 20,000 jobs for the construction of stage one alone, and by connecting 200,000 jobs within walking distance of the route. When completed, it’s expected that 140,000 people will ride the Green Line every day. Stage one of construction is expected to have a daily ridership of 65,000 people. 
History.
Early history.
Trams ran on the surface of Centre Street for 41 years, from 1909 to 1950. The Green Line will restore the historic alignment of Calgary’s trams, running trains on the surface of Centre Street as well. 
The Green Line was first envisioned in 1983, two years after Calgary’s first LRT line opened. As early as 1986, the communities of McKenzie Towne, New Brighton and Copperfield had set aside land along 52 Street SE for the future line. In 1987, the city then conducted the "Southeast Mass Transit Corridor Study" and concluded that southeast Calgary would one day require a dedicated light rail line. 
Original proposal.
In 2010, the city anticipated that the Green Line would be required before Calgary’s population reached 1.25 million, though the city surpassed that population just 5 years later. Chronic congestion on Deerfoot Trail is partly attributed to the failure to construct the Green Line before the 1.25 million population target. In 2011, the city began considering three possible alignments for the north-central leg of the Green Line: along Nose Creek adjacent to Deerfoot Trail, on Edmonton Trail, or on Centre Street. After engagement with the public, the city selected Centre Street as the preferred alignment. In 2012, the Green Line was proposed as two separate new lines — one from downtown to north central and one from downtown to the southeast. The division of the line was rejected by council. Through 2016, $101 million had been spent on right-of-way acquisition and preliminary studies. In May 2017, the city revealed the line's suggested alignment and announced it would be built in stages due to the unexpectedly high costs of certain design choices. Although the original estimate for the entire 28-station Green Line was $4.5 billion, the cost of stage one alone, including the $1.95 billion cost of the centre city tunnel, was estimated at $4.65 billion. 
Funding and alignment changes.
In 2015, the Government of Canada announced that it would invest a historic $1.53 billion in the Green Line, the single largest federal investment for an infrastructure project in Alberta, ever. In early 2019, Alberta’s NDP provincial government committed $1.53 billion in funding paid for by the provincial carbon tax. Over time, the City of Calgary set aside funding for the Green Line and has designated a $1.53 billion investment in the project. The Green Line is funded by three roughly equal contributions from all three orders of government. In late 2019, after the 2019 Alberta General Election, the newly elected United Conservative provincial government cut the Green Line’s budget by 86% and passed legislation allowing their government to terminate their contribution “without cause” and with only 90 days notice. This move complicated the city’s ability to move forward with the project, hinders the city’s access to the federal government’s investment and has raised uncertainty among potential procurement bidders. The provincial government’s decision has also temporarily made the City of Calgary the sole funder of the project as they do not have access to the federal government’s contribution until stage one of construction is complete. On May 12, 2020, the city announced changes to the alignment of the line to keep the project within budget. The revised alignment replaced the deep-earth tunnel under the Bow River with an elevated guideway over the east end of Prince's Island Park. The elimination of the tunnel under the river significantly reduces construction cost and risk. The changes also brought the line to the surface between 9 Avenue N and 16 Avenue N, running along the two centre lanes of Centre Street in a dedicated right of way. The Green Line north of 16 Avenue N has been planned as a surface running train since the city’s 2017 recommendations. The changes also included the addition of 9 Avenue N Station in Crescent Heights, increasing the number of stations in stage one of construction to 15, and bringing the total number of stations to 29. 2 Avenue SW Station and 4 Street SE Station were moved from being at-grade to underground and the Beltline section of the line was moved one block north to run under 11 Avenue South, rather than under 12 Avenue South as initially recommended. The plan for a tunnel under the intersection of Barlow Trail and 114 Avenue SE was scrapped in favour of an elevated guideway over the intersection, and the park and ride at Shepard station was revised from a parkade to a surface parking lot. 
Opposition.
As the megaproject's approval was looming in early 2020, a group of wealthy oil industry and business executives, all with ties to the United Conservative Party, organized an invite only event at the Calgary Petroleum Club with city officials. Despite speculation that the group's objective was to cancel the project despite its popular public support, some attendees insisted otherwise. One of the participants, oil industry executive Jim Gray, suggested the group was not opposed to the line but instead wanted to "de-risk" it. The group called for replacing half of the rail line with a bus, cancelling the downtown subway, and for the use of high-floor trains. The group also funneled thousands of dollars into an online advertising campaign opposing the Green Line under the titles of ""An Ad Hoc Committee of Calgary Citizens"," "Rethink the Green Line", and "Green Line Done Right". Facebook says the group’s ads were seen by millions of Albertans. The group also published editorials in local newspapers, like the Calgary Herald, making a variety of dubious claims about the project and calling for its pause or cancellation. Additionally, the group hung anti-Green Line flyers in communities around the city and operated a website opposing the Green Line. In December 2020, the United Conservative Minister of Transportation, Ric McIver, rebuked the Green Line saying in a statement that the train is a "line to nowhere" and the city does not have "any credible plan". After an additional 6 months of delays subsequent to McIver’s statement saying the project’s technical plans were inadequate, the province then announced the technical issues had been resolved despite no changes to the line’s design or alignment. Despite the issue cited as the reason the province failed to contribute their pledged portion of the project’s funding being resolved, the United Conservative provincial government then announced that it would continue withholding funding, the city needed to produce a new business case for the line, and it would be investing in the widening of Deerfoot Trail. The Alberta provincial government has also retained legislation allowing them to revoke their contribution with only 90 days notice. Officials say this move complicates the project’s procurement, increased the project’s overall cost by millions of dollars and delayed the project by one year. Despite these actions, the provincial government maintains publicly that they support the idea of the Green Line. On July 7, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau met privately with Alberta Premier Jason Kenney at the Fairmount Palliser Hotel in downtown Calgary. Less than three hours later, the Alberta Government announced it had approved the Green Line without modifications and would contribute their pledged portion of the line's funding. After over a year of delays inflicted by the provincial government, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Mayor Naheed Nenshi, members of council, and various other stakeholders gathered at the Oliver Bowen Light Rail Maintenance Facility in Calgary to announce the Green Line would continue as planned. Jason Kenney declined to attend the announcement and sent no provincial representatives. 2021 Calgary mayoral candidate Jeromy Farkas was the only member of council to vote against the nearly unanimous approval of the project. 
Approval and public opinion.
On June 16, 2020, council voted 14 to 1 to approve construction stage one of the Green Line despite vocal opposition from a small group of wealthy and influential businesspeople. The project received final approval from all three orders of government on July 7, 2021. Several polls conducted in 2020 and 2021 have suggested that the megaproject has popular public support. A poll conducted in June 2020 found 68.7% of Calgarians in support of the project with its updated 2020 alignment. According to a 2021 survey conducted by the City of Calgary, 90% of respondents said the Green Line is important to the future of the city and 89% said it is an important addition to the city’s transportation network. The CA$5.5 billion cost of stage one will be shared in roughly equal portions between the federal government, provincial government, and the City of Calgary. On July 10, 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said "The money is there and the agreements are signed, so regardless of an election, the Green Line is going to go forward."
Construction.
The City of Calgary began preparing for construction in 2017 with utility relocation and environmental redemption projects along the alignment of the line and spent over $500 million. The city states the project is "shovel ready". On December 17, 2020 the City of Calgary temporarily "paused" construction procurement after the United Conservative provincial government failed to transfer their contribution of the line's funding that was committed in 2015. That same day, the spokesman for the party's Minister of Transportation, Ric McIver, stated that the train is a "line to nowhere". Due to the ongoing issues inflicted by the provincial government, reports surfaced in March 2021 indicating that construction was unlikely to begin in early 2021 as previously planned by the city. Mayor Nenshi stated that the provincial government's actions delayed construction of the line and added "tens of millions of dollars" to the project's cost. On May 25, 2021, the City of Calgary announced construction would start Autumn 2021 on the Beltline segment of the line. The city selected PCL Construction as the construction management contractor. Stage one of construction is expected to be completed in 2027.

InterPortPolice

The INTERPORTPOLICE (also InterPortPolice) is the international organization of law enforcement agencies established to combat serious transnational crimes, such as terrorism and drug smuggling an various transportation hubs, such as seaports and airports, and involving airport, seaport, transport and border police forces.
The organization was established in 1969, initially under the name International Organization of Port Authority Police. In 1974 airport authorities were included into the organization, and its name was changed accordingly to the International Association of Airport and Seaport Police (IAASP). In 2010 its charter was expanded again, to include transport and border authorities. This time, rather than expand the name, it was decided to use the acronym INTERPORTPOLICE to represent the international association of airport, seaport, and transport law enforcement.
History.
The InterPortPolice is an international organization of law enforcement, which focuses on critical infrastructure for airport and seaport authorities. Development of the organisation began in 1968 by police departments from Canada, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and the United States to address transnational crime. The organization's original name was International Organization of Port Authority Police. The first meeting was held in 1970 at the Mass Port Authority. Four years later the group added airport authorities and changed their name to International Association of Airport and Seaport Police (IAASP). In 2010, the focus was broadened by including a holistic approach of all authorities within the security boundary to include border and large event requirements. At that time the name InterPortPolice was adopted to stand for International Organization of Airport and Seaport Police. Today they represent airport, seaport, border, and transport police and security requirements.
Fred V. Morrone.
The executive vice president of the organization, Fred V. Morrone, died in the September 11 attacks.
Not only was Morrone the vice president of the InterPortPolice, but also Superintendent of police and Director of Public Safety at the Port Authority in New York and New Jersey. He was raised in New York and New Jersey. He went to Richard Stockton College, where he received a bachelor's degree in political science. He received his master's degree in public administration from Rider University. Morrone had many jobs in law enforcement, including state trooper.
Morrone was 63 when he led Port Authority police officers into the towers. He and 36 other officers died when the tower collapsed. Morrone was a husband and a father of three children. 
A year after the attacks at the 9/11 memorial for the fallen officers, InterPortPolice and Morrone's family created the Morrone Education Program, set up to educate officers and help aid in the fight against terrorism.

Torn Down

Torn Down is a 2018 remix album by British alternative rock band The Cure, and a sequel to the 1990 remix album "Mixed Up". It was released on Record Store Day 2018 (21 April, Robert Smith's 59th birthday), as was a remastered version of "Mixed Up". A three-disc deluxe edition also includes "Mixed Up Extras 2018: Remixes 1982–1990" on disc 2, featuring additional remastered material.
The project was first originally announced in 2009, with Robert Smith saying in 2012 that the double album would consist of "our favourite bands remixing Cure songs", but the final product instead features sixteen new mixes done by Smith himself, selecting one song from each album in chronological order.
On 13 April 2018, the "Time Mix" of "Want" was debuted on BBC Radio 6. The interview confirms that "Torn Down" is the last disc in a 3-CD set, with the first being the newly remastered "Mixed Up", followed by a "collection of rare 12 inches from '82 til 1990". Robert Smith states that he "just fancied doing some remixes", with the desire to create one from each album and "remix Cure songs that wouldn't normally be chosen for remixing, songs like "The Drowning Man" — the more sort of esoteric Cure songs." The interview also confirms that this release marks the continuation of The Cure's deluxe edition re-release campaign, and that the deluxe edition of "Wish" has been completed and will presumably follow.

A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences was published in London in 1806-7. It was originally supposed to be edited by Dr. George Gregory, Prebendary of St. Paul's. However, Gregory was too involved in his clerical affairs, so most of the material was written by an anonymous hack writer, Jeremiah Joyce. As it would turn out, another encyclopedia meant to compete with the "Dictionary", the "British Encyclopedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences" which was supposedly edited by William Nicholson, was also written mostly by an anonymous hack writer, who turned out to be the same man.

Luna 28 (Luna Resource 2 or Luna-Grunt rover) is a proposed sample-return mission from the south polar region of the Moon.
Mission.
Luna 28 is proposed to launch no earlier than 2027, and it would be composed of a stationary lunar lander and a lunar rover. The rover would bring soil samples back to the lander and transfer them into the ascent stage, which would launch and insert itself into a 100 km lunar orbit. While in lunar orbit, the soil-carrying capsule would be intercepted by an orbiting return module, which would perform all rendezvous operations and transfer the samples. After reloading the samples, the return vehicle separates from the orbiter and heads to Earth, while the orbital module continues its mission in the lunar orbit for at least three years.
Potential collaboration.
NASA is assessing a potential cooperation with Russia for Luna 25 through Luna 28.

C&amp;C 32

The C&amp;C 32 is a Canadian sailboat, that was designed by C&amp;C Design and first built in 1981.
The boat was built by C&amp;C Yachts in Canada, but it is now out of production.
Design.
The C&amp;C 32 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel or, optionally, a fixed stub keel and centreboard.
The fixed keel version displaces and carries of lead ballast, while the centreboard version displaces and carries of lead ballast.
The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional stub keel with the centreboard extended and with it retracted.
The boat is fitted with a Universal Atomic 4 gasoline engine. A Yanmar 2GM diesel engine was available optionally. The fuel tank holds and the fresh water tank has a capacity of .
The fin keel version has a PHRF racing average handicap of 162 with a high of 172 and low of 156. The stub keel and centreboard version has a PHRF racing average handicap of 171 with a high of 171 and low of 171. It has a hull speed of .
Operational history.
In a review Michael McGoldrick wrote, "The C&amp;C 32 captures the essence of the cruiser/club racer of the early 1980s. While this boat may not [have] emerged as a C&amp;C classic, it does epitomize the builder's work at the height of its role and reputation in the Canadian sailboat industry. In many ways, this boat seems like the natural evolution of what C&amp;C had started with its earlier 27 and 30 foots models, only everything is a little larger, and its lines are little more modern looking. Below is the familiar dinette arrangement opposite a full length settee, a layout which it has in common with its earlier predecessors. However, the interior of the 32 also has room for a quarter berth and a permanent chart table/navigation station. Outside is a large T-shaped cockpit, and the nice clean lines of the deck and cabin is what helped earn C&amp;C a reputation for coming up with good looking designs."

On 11 September 1907, he entered the Assumptionist novitiate of Louvain, Belgium, where took the name of Brother Venance. He made his first vows on 1 September 1908, then his perpetual vows in Gempe, Belgium on 12 September 1909. He took philosophy courses in Rome, where he obtained a degree (1909-1911). He made his teaching debut at Elorrio (1911-1913). He began his studies of theology in Jerusalem (1913-1914) and completed them in Italy - at Rome (1915-1916) and Fara in Sabina (1916-1917). He was ordained a priest of the Assumptionist order on 16 May 1916. He devoted himself to teaching in schools of his order: Bourville, Normandy (1917-1919); in Taintignies, Belgium (1919-1920); and Kadıköy, Turkey (1920).
Whilst teaching in Kadıköy, he became interested in Byzantine studies. And from 1922, his pursued a career with French Institute of Byzantine Studies (IFEB), which he followed to Bucharest (1937) and Paris (1957). He contributed articles to the "Revue des études byzantines", and later became the journal's secretary. He was a researcher, teacher, contributor to of encyclopedias and specialized dictionaries. He established the chronology of the patriarchs of Constantinople. A recognized Byzantinist, he became a research master at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in 1955. He died in Paris on 13 August 1967, and was buried at the Montparnasse cemetery.
Research.
Grumel devoted himself to the studies of Byzantine history, with a particular interest for the history of the Byzantine Church and its relationship with the Western Catholic Church: one main research field of him was the history of councils. He studied in depth the Photian Schism and its implications.
He edited the registers of the acts of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople and compiled a monograph about Byzantine chronology which still is in use.

BMW i4

The G26 BMW i4 is an all-electric five-door liftback styled sedan made by German automobile manufacturer BMW, marketed as a four-door coupé with sales commencing in 2021. The initial concept version, named BMW i Vision Dynamics, debuted at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show. It is the fifth BMW i sub-brand model, and will be sold in several variants at different performance levels, including the first battery-electric variant by BMW's motorsport division.
Development and launch.
An investment of about in the Munich plant was made in preparation for the 2021 series production as the G26 BMW i4 is built on the same assembly line as cars with combustion engines and plug-in hybrids. While 90% of the existing production equipment in the body shop were incorporated into the production process of the i4, several new systems were required mainly for the floor assembly and rear structure as the electric drive and high-voltage battery are different from conventional architectures. The plant was closed for six weeks in the summer of 2020 to convert more than 1000 robots in the body shop and assembly area to prepare it for the assembly of the i4. The electric motor is assembled in Dingolfing. The i4 was revealed fully production-ready in March 2021, three months ahead of schedule, and will be available for sale in November 2021.
Over an ownership period of , the eDrive40 is supposed to have a 45 percent lower global warming potential than that of a comparable diesel G20 3 Series or G22 4 Series model. Furthermore, BMW enhanced the sustainability of its supply chain and increased its use of recycled materials for the i4, cutting the production emissions by 18 percent.
Specifications.
Body and chassis.
The production model is based on the modular CLAR platform to keep costs low and volume-production attainable. It is described as a battery-powered G20 3 Series and is technically closely related to the G26 4 Series Gran Coupé. The G26 i4 has a MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension with rear air suspension as standard (the M50 adds adaptive M dampers). It has a damping system designed to reduce “dipping movements of the body” under acceleration or braking, with an “actuator-related wheel slip limitation” system to better boost traction and stability.The i4 has an almost completely flat underbody, resulting in a low drag coefficient of 0.24 for the eDrive40 and 0.25 for the M50. Compared to the G20 3 Series, it has wider front tracks and wider rear tracks. Due to the low floor location of the battery pack for better agility, the M50's center of gravity is lower than the G20 3 Series and lower in the eDrive40. An active air flap control at the bottom of the grille can be adjusted in ten stages, allowing cooling air to be supplied to the drive system, battery, brakes, and air conditioning system in precise quantities. The eDrive40 has a 45:55 weight distribution, while it is 48:52 for the M50.
Powertrain.
The electric drive component of the i4, its charging unit and high-voltage battery are all developed in-house by the BMW Group, forming the fifth-generation eDrive system. A notable technical feature of the i4's powertrain concerns its packaging. The electric motor, transmission and power electronics are all contained in a single component, which allows for a higher efficiency of energy conversion. BMW also focussed on reducing the number of rare earth materials in the battery and electric motor system. None are used to construct the motor (efficiency factor of 93 percent), while the battery uses two thirds less cobalt than before. The motors themselves are positioned in the axles, and the axles also house the one-speed transmissions.
The M50 can recuperate braking energy at a max rate of 195 kW and 116 kW for the eDrive40. The three adjustable regenerative braking levels includes a robust setting for one-pedal driving, while the fourth adaptive mode uses GPS data and driver-assistance systems to adjust the amount of regenerative braking. The eDrive40 is a rear-wheel drive model, where power comes from a single electrically excited synchronous motor that is fitted to the rear axle. The M50 runs predominantly in rear-wheel drive mode, conserving energy and thus increasing range. The larger electric motor reside at the rear, while the smaller only kicks in when the front tires require power.
Battery.
The tall battery in the i4 is made up of four modules with 72 cells each and three 12-cell modules, which is located in the floorpan in a process that's claimed to add rigidity to the overall structure. The battery enclosure is directly connected to the front axle subframe, while the battery pack is bolted to the floor assembly with 22 bolts. There also is an additional section of the battery housed within the center tunnel in the place usually taken up by a driveshaft. The i4’s battery has 40 percent more energy density than the 120 Ah version of the BMW i3.
The fifth-generation eDrive system supports up to 200 kW DC fast charging. The battery pack can be charged to 80 percent in 31 minutes or ten minutes for a range of in the eDrive40, and in the M50. Using a Level 2 wall box with AC power and a charging rate of 11 kW, the i4 can recharge its battery from 0–100 percent in under eight hours. 
The i4 features an integrated heating and cooling system that takes into account various factors such as ambient temperature and mid-journey fast-charging sessions to precondition the temperature of the battery pack. It does this automatically via high efficiency pumps that can increase range efficiency by up to 31 percent when driving in urban traffic. 
Equipment.
All models feature the iDrive 8 infotainment system, including an updated voice-controlled assistant and gesture control system, while the iDrive controller is also retained on the centre console. The interface is sourced through the BMW Curved Display that combines the 12.3-inch instrument cluster and 14.9-inch infotainment system with a redesigned touch interface within a single unit. The iDrive 8 system features Apple CarPlay and Android Auto capability, compatible with 5G mobile technology, while third-party applications for communication and music streaming are also integrated within the system. The over-the-air functionality is increased and incorporate updates to driving functions, such as driving assistance and semi-autonomous features. A number of ambient lighting elements are placed throughout the cabin and change color depending on the driving mode. The iDrive 8 system is integrated with the new My BMW App for smartphones.
Standard equipment includes a sports steering wheel with multifunction buttons and sports seats, three-zone climate control, acoustic glazing for the windshield, pre-heating and pre-conditioning, and an electrically operated tailgate. Optional equipment includes such as seat heating and ventilation, M Sport Package Pro, ambient lighting and a glass slide/tilt sunroof. An M Carbon exterior package and M Performance Parts can also be ordered as an option. The i4 offer a 10-speaker audio system with a 205-Watt amplifier as standard, while a Harman Kardon system with 16 speakers with a digital seven-channel amplifier is an optional equipment. Full LED headlights and tail lights are standard, though the former can be upgraded to adaptive units with BMW Laserlight and BMW Selective Beam function. It is available in wheel sizes from 17 inch to 20 inch with wider rear tires as standard. 
The i4 comes with an acoustic pedestrian protection system, which is an artificially generated sound produced by the exterior speakers that is active when driving up to in Europe or in the US. Furthermore, it has up to 40 driver assistance systems, enabling Level 2 semi autonomous driving. Standard driver assistance systems including lane departure warning, intelligent speed adaptation, collision warning with braking intervention, front and rear parking sensors, and a backup camera. A Driving Assistance Professional package is optional, which adds adaptive cruise control with stop and go, lane-keep assist with side collision avoidance, and rear automatic emergency braking. The optional parking assistant system displays a three-dimensional 360 degree view of the car and its surroundings. The maximum towing capacity is , with an additional roof load possible.
Models.
Models introduced at launch include the high-performance M50 with a dual-motor xDrive all-wheel system, the first battery-electric vehicle by BMW's motorsport division, and eDrive40 with a single-motor, rear-wheel-drive layout. The base RWD model eDrive35 will arrive at a later date. 
Concept cars.
The BMW i4 was mainly previewed by two concept cars: BMW i Vision Dynamics (2017) and BMW Concept i4 (2020), as well as the Vision Next 100 (2016). 
BMW i Vision Dynamics (2017).
The initial BMW i Vision Dynamics concept debuted at the 2017 Frankfurt Motor Show, and was built on the flexible CLAR platform rather than a carbon-fibre structure as with the contemporary i3 and i8 electric models. The i Vision Dynamics concept gave a hint at BMW's intention to make a mid-sized EV four-door coupé. It was powered by a single electric motor on the rear axle. The car had projected performance figures of 0–100 km/h in 4.0 seconds, and a top speed of over . BMW's range goal for the i Vision Dynamics was on the European WLTP cycle. The design of the i Vision Dynamics was based on the study Vision Next 100 from 2016.
Although the interior was not finished, BMW promised a great view outwards via the "flush integration of glass into the main body". Controversially, the i Vision Dynamics featured a reworking of the double-kidney grille that covered a plethora of sensors. Depending on the legal environment, BMW intimated that the goal was to launch the production car with the capability to work at Level 3 or Level 4 autonomous driving, which require differing types of human input depending on circumstances.
The production version was announced at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show as the BMW i4. At the 2018 Paris Motor Show, BMW confirmed the launch year for the i4 as being 2021. 
BMW Concept i4 (2020).
The BMW Concept i4 was presented in March 2020 and reiterated a lot of i4’s specifications that was shared at the LA Auto Show in November 2019. The design language of the Concept i4 more closely resembled the production model than the i Vision Dynamics. The single rear-motor was projected to be rated at that was on par with one of BMW’s V8 combustion engines, though media doubted this claim as V8’s are connected to a xDrive system. It was clarified that the i4 would come with an EPA-estimated range of from an 80 kWh battery pack, though the production model has an EPA-rated range of .
The BMW Concept i4 was an evolution of the i Vision Dynamics design study from 2017. The proportions were classic coupé, featuring a long wheelbase, fastback roofline and short overhangs. The exterior design had been kept simple with its smooth lines and clear surfaces "as a deliberate counterpoint to the dynamic flair of the driving experience". The covered kidney grille served primarily as an "intelligence panel" housing the various sensors for autonomous driving.
The concept featured a stretched wheelbase with BMW claiming it would offer plenty of cabin space. The highly futuristic and minimalistic interior was dominated by the BMW Curved Display that was angled toward the driver, featuring the newest BMW Operating System 8. Other notable features was an all-glass roof, mixture of cloth and leather in the seats and dash with bronze and chrome fixtures, and replacement of touchpoints with crystal-like plastic.

Balichão

Balichão (Cantonese: , "haam4 haa1 zoeng3", "salt shrimp sauce") is an ingredient that is used in a number of dishes in Macanese cuisine. It is made with shrimp, aguardente, salt, pepper, bay leaves and malagueta chillies.
Characteristics.
Despite being commonly described as a shrimp paste, some sources state balichão is actually made with krill. Some describe Balichão as a fish sauce.
Balichão is noted for having a distinct odor that some find foul. Some, however, find balichão's smell and taste milder and mellower than shrimp pastes from Southeast Asia.
History.
There are at least two theories on where the word "balichão" originated. One theory states the word is believed to have evolved from the Portuguese word for Whale (baleia). Another theory states the word is a corruption of the word "belachang", which is one of a number of Malay words for shrimp paste.
Balichão is noted as originating from shrimp pastes that were brought to Macao by Portuguese sailors who discovered it during their voyage to the city, and later developed by locals as a special variant.
Balichãos are noted to have a tradition of being home made, and can take up to a month to mature.
In 2009, Balichão is described as an almost extinct condiment, as people look for its substitute among other, more readily available ingredients.
Ingredients.
Besides krill, Balichão contains bay leaves, chili, clove, lime, peppercorn, and is laced with fortified wine.
Culture.
Balichão is noted to be so central to Macanese culture, that Macanese people call themselves "balichung" as an affectionate demonym. There is also a street named after balichão in Macao, named "Travessa do Balichão" ().

He has published over 120 articles in peer-reviewed scientific venues, and served on the board of over a dozen regional and national meteorological committees, conferences, and scientific journals.
Outreach and scientific advocacy.
Mass maintains a popular weblog in which he posts regular articles on meteorology, Pacific Northwest weather history, and the impacts of climate change written for the general public. According to Mass, "Global warming is an extraordinarily serious issue, and scientists have a key role to play in communicating what is known and what is not about this critical issue."
Mass has stated publicly that he shares the scientific consensus that global warming is real and that human activity is a major cause of warming trend in the late 20th and 21st centuries. He has been critical of the Paris Climate accord for not going far enough to address the negative impacts of climate change. 
However, Mass is frequently critical of and has expressed concern that when media and environmental organizations make exaggerated claims about the current impacts of climate change, or cite climate change as the cause of specific weather events. He is concerned about misinforming the public about a key societal issue, distracting public and governmental attention from more immediate environmental concerns, and stifling opportunities for effective bipartisan policy-making to slow climate change and mitigate its effects.
His statements on the severity and progression of anthropogenic global warming have elicited condemnation from "The Stranger" as well as members of activist environmental organizations due to concerns that Mass's scientific approach to understanding and communicating the risks associated with global warming could result in public apathy or be used by climate change deniers to bolster their claims.
Mass advocated for the acquisition and installation of the Langley Hill Doppler weather radar in 2011, the first on the Washington coast.
In July 2021, Mass attracted controversy for blog posts that concluded that global warming was not a central factor in the 2021 Western North America heat wave. Mass's analysis of a World Weather Attribution report asserting the connection garnered criticism from some of the report's authors.
Opinions on non-weather-related topics.
Mass has used numerous media, including radio shows, Twitter accounts, and a personal blog, to broadcast opinions about numerous topics not related to the weather. These have sometimes generated controversy.
Starting around 2008, KUOW warned Mass to stop voicing his opinions about subjects such as math education on his weather segment on the show "Weekday". The show's host, Steve Scher, noted that holders of opposing viewpoints complained to the station that they deserved equal time. Scher in 2011 removed Mass's segment from "Weekday", prompting hundreds of emails to be sent to the station and a protest at the station. Mass later wrote an article defending his actions in "The Stranger".
In 2016, Mass advocated in favor of Washington Initiative I-732, which would have been the first carbon tax measure in the United States. Mass later advocated against a different initiative to enact a carbon fee, Washington Initiative I-1631, in 2018, suggesting it was highly regressive and ineffective. Both measures were rejected. His 2018 opposition was used by the "No on 1631" campaign, and drew condemnation from some alternative publications.
On his personal blog on August 5, 2020, Mass likened the persistent riots and vandalism in downtown Seattle months after the George Floyd protests in Seattle to "Kristallnacht", calling photos of the damage "eerily similar to those of 80 years ago." He subsequently defended the comparison in the comments to that entry. The next day, KNKX announced that it would stop airing "Weather with Cliff Mass" effective immediately citing "offensive and inaccurate" rhetoric in that personal blog post. Mass temporarily removed the words "Kristallnacht" and "Brownshirts" from his post, describing the passage that contained them as "a source of distraction to some," before restoring them.
Personal life.
Mass, who is Jewish, has stated the value of "tikkun olam" has informed his approach to science.

Steven Bryan

Steven Bryan (born Francesco Dell'Orco; 4 April 1982) is an Italian/English singer-songwriter. He has released two studio albums to date: "One Way" (2010) and "Gravity Always Wins" (2017).
Early career.
Born in Milan, Italy as Francesco Dell'Orco, Bryan grew up listening to a range of folk, rock and roll, soul, and his father's classical music collection. Moving around the world as a child, he took influence from American and British songwriters such as Bob Dylan, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, The Beatles and Cat Stevens.
Steven started playing regular gigs in his hometown with various cover bands around 1999, however he soon realised that the only way to get a career in the music business was to play original songs.
But to do that, he needed a change. "I felt like Milan had nothing left to offer, I was feeling a little cramped and unmotivated, so I decided to move to London".
"One Way (2010–16)".
Steven Bryan landed in London in 2007 and played the acoustic circuit intensively for a couple of years while writing over 25 songs for his debut album, "One Way".
The album caught the attention of a few record labels, and Bryan signed a worldwide deal with Right Track Records/Universal Music Operations in 2011 for his first single "Puppets On TV".
"Puppets On TV" has been featured on BBC Radio 2, BBC London 94.9 and Cool FM in the UK and IHeartRadio in the US.
Bryan and his band played a series of sold-out UK shows in 2012, but after difficulties with the record label and his manager they eventually decided to part ways in 2013. "It wasn't as peaceful as I would have liked, and it left a deep scar to be honest. At one point I almost thought I was done with music, and frankly didn't mind. I even went all the way to Australia, I just wanted to be far away from that world! But then something happened.. as soon as I said "Screw this!" I found myself writing songs like never before, probably out of anger and frustration. I went back to London in 2015 and started working on my new album almost immediately".
"Gravity Always Wins (2017–19)".
"Gravity Always Wins" revitalised Bryan's passion for songwriting, by deciding to go away from the full band formula present on "One Way" and instead shine the spotlight of just his voice and acoustic guitar.
Produced by Francesco Lo Castro, the album was released on 27 June 2017 and consists of 11 tracks, including a new version of "Lights," already on the previous album "One Way".
The first two singles off "Gravity Always Wins" are "Sing To Me", released on 3 June 2016, and "Dolled Up", released on 16 February 2018.

Locomotives SFM 1-34

Locomotives SFM 1-34 refers to a class of 2-2-2 steam locomotives of the Società Italiana per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali (SFM). They were designed for hauling fast passenger trains.
History.
The locomotives, numbered from 1 to 34, were ordered by SFM from Cail of Paris and Officine di Pietrarsa to work on the lightly-graded lines Bologna - Ancona and Ancona - Bari.
In 1885, with the creation of the great national networks, the series was divided between Rete Adriatica (the Adriatic Network - RA), which obtained units 1 to 26, and Rete Mediterranea (the Mediterranean Network - RM), which obtained units 27 to 34 and renumbered them 7 to 14.
In 1905, with the establishment of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), 12 units were still in operation. FS classified them as Class 100 with numbers 1001–1012. After a few years they were withdrawn and scrapped.

Levering Smith

Vice Admiral Levering Smith (5 March 1910 – 5 April 1993) was a United States Navy admiral. He is best known for his role in the development of the Polaris, Poseidon and Trident missiles for ballistic missile submarines.
Biography.
Levering Smith was born in Joplin, Missouri, on 5 March 1910 to Aaron Levering and Ethel (McClellan) Smith. He entered the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, Maryland, from which he graduated with the class of 1932. He served on the battleship from 1932 to 1936, and the destroyer from 1936 to 1938, before returning to Annapolis as an instructor. He then attended the Naval Postgraduate School from 1939 to 1940.
During World War II, Smith was posted to the aircraft carrier , serving on it until it was sunk in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands in October 1942. He then served on the cruiser until it, too, was sunk in the Battle of Tassafaronga the following month. He later participated in the Battle of the Philippine Sea on the fleet flagship .
After the war, Smith was posted to the Naval Ordnance Test Station at China Lake, California, where he worked with rockets as the head of first the Explosives Department and then as associate technical director. He came to the conclusion that solid-propellant rockets were the best solution for shipboard and submarine use. In 1954, he became the head of the Explosive Department at the Naval Ordnance Missile Test Facility at White Sands, New Mexico, concurrently serving as the Navy deputy to the Army general in command of the White Sands Missile Range.
In 1955, the Navy became involved in a joint intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) project with the Army to develop the Jupiter missile. Dissatisfied with liquid-propellant rockets, the Navy pulled out of the project. The head of the Special Projects Office, Rear Admiral William F. Raborn, Jr., brought in Smith to help develop a solid-fuel missile, which became the Polaris missile. The improvement in safety could be compared to a family taking a bag of charcoal on vacation instead of a can of gasoline.
He went on to work on the Poseidon and Trident missiles, serving as director of the Special Projects Office from 1966 until his retirement in 1974. Rear Admiral Robert A. Wertheim recalled that 
In addition to his work on the US Navy's ballistic missile projects, he provided crucial support to the UK Polaris missile program. According to "The Daily Telegraph", "... it was no small measure due to him [Levering Smith] that the British Polaris programme was completed on time and on budget — an unprecedented feat in British naval history." For this, he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire on 7 January 1972.
Smith died of cancer at Scripps Mercy Hospital in San Diego, California, on 5 April 1993, and was buried in San Marcos District Cemetery in San Marcos, California. He was survived by his wife, Beulah Weymouth Lewis Smith (1913–2007). Since 1986, he had been honored by the Vice Admiral Levering Smith Award for Submarine Support Achievement. Presented by the Naval Submarine League, it "recognizes specific or continuing submarine support actions which have most contributed to the furtherance of the spirit or fighting mettle of the Submarine Force."
His awards included three awards of the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the American Defense Service Medal with one star, and the Asiatic–Pacific Campaign Medal with eleven stars. His received the L.T.E. Thompson Award from the Naval Ordnance Test Station and the C. N. Hickman from the American Rocket Society in 1957; the American Society of Naval Engineers' Gold Medal and the Rear Admiral William S. Parsons Award from Navy League of the United States in 1961; the Gold Knight of Management Award from the National Management Association in 1972; and an honorary doctor of laws degree from New Mexico State University. In 1965, he was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.

North Point Global

North Point Global Ltd. (NPG) was a Liverpool based real estate developer. With a head office in Edward pavilion (Salthouse quay), it was established in 2015 primarily to develop one of the regions around Liverpool's docks off Great George street. However, it filed for bankruptcy in 2018 leaving its Chinese investors in the lurch.
New Chinatown development (Liverpool).
Though the group had not completed any housing project in the UK, it announced plans in December 2015 to develop a so-called "New Chinatown" near Liverpool docks for £200m, consisting of glitzy glass buildings and sky scrapers, a hotel, a business center and 280 homes. The development was planned over three sites - two owned by the Liverpool City Council and a third site owned by Urban Splash under the Tribeca scheme.
It marketed these houses to middle class individual buyers and investors in Hong Kong and tier 1 cities of China in expo exhibitions, advertising guaranteed returns. The first phase of the project was promised to be completed in 2017 and the entire project completed by 2019. In an interview in July 2016, its chairman David Chowles told reporters that 46 of its 127 residential units had already been sold by July 2016, with most of the shops on leaseholds. Its commercial spaces were built to allow small investors from China to take advantage of the Tier 1 entrepreneur's visa programme. Most investors consisted of individual families who had paid £40,000 each as 30% downpayment for their apartment. Some prospective investors paid up to 50% of their share upfront as a deposit. The site is current being demolished and awaiting designs for a new development.
However, other than the inauguration program in 2016, no development took place at the site. The NPG group sold the development rights in 2017 to another shell company called "Your Housing Group". At around the same time, Built, the subcontractor who was planned to carry out its construction developed financial problems and was closed down.
In February 2018, Bloomberg reported that North Points projects had been stalled and put up for sale, leaving hundreds of Hong Kong and Chinese purchasers in the lurch. In 2018, the Liverpool Echo reported that construction had still not started at the site which was now filled with garbage and infested with rats.
Other developments in Liverpool and Manchester.
As of October 2017, five projects of North Point in Liverpool were suspended due to a paucity of funds and financial problems, without any repayments to investors. These were new China Town, Baltic house, North Point Pall mall, The Paramount and The Quadrant. Some in the press suspected the group to be involved in money laundering, but this was never proven.
In March 2018, an exposé by The Guardian revealed that North point was just one of the many fraudulent real estate development schemes floated in the UK to lure in individual Chinese small investors. At least one of them was promoted by the ex chancellor George Osborne. One was Pinnacle Angelgate, the company behind the Angelgate project in Manchester, went into administration in 2017. It was a sister company of North point global. Many of the proposed 344 apartments in that project were also sold off-plan to Chinese and Hong Kong investors, who paid deposits of more than £31m to secure the properties.

Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve

The Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve is a 3,500 acre wetland, located in Fort Myers, Florida, which filters rainwater on its way towards Estero Bay. The preserve contains a 1.2-mile boardwalk trail, interpretive center, and amphitheater. The slough is a nine mile long, one-third of a mile wide, wildlife corridor, providing a safe way for animals to travel within the Fort Myers city limits. A 57-square-mile watershed drains into the slough.
The Six Mile Cypress Slough Preserve boardwalk hours are from dawn to dusk year-round. The Interpretive Center hours are from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Sunday.
The parking fee is $1 per hour per vehicle, maximum $5 for the day. Lee County Annual Parking Stickers are accepted at this location.
History.
The Monday Group, a Fort Myers high school environmental class, went door-to-door, petitioning that Lee County residents raise their own taxes to purchase and protect the slough as a preserve. As a result, the students gathered enough signatures for a referendum to be placed on the ballot in 1976.

Thrond Sjursen Haukenæs

Thrond Sjursen Haukenæs (March 4, 1840 – November 14, 1922) was a Norwegian folklore collector and an author, publisher, and distributor of his own works. 
Haukenæs was born at the Haukanes farm on the Granvin Fjord between Granvin and Folkedal in Hordaland county. Haukenæs initially worked as a shepherd, and then spent several years fishing for herring and also traveling around as a book seller. He married Kristi Gjerdsdotter Aalvik (1849–1914) from Indre Ålvik in 1871 and then settled down as a trader in Granvin. He went into business with his friend Rikoll Eide. Haukenæs then became the manager of the Graven Consumer Association ("Gravens Forbrugsforening"), which developed to operate mail services, a coaching inn, and a hotel. The association experienced economic difficulties, and so Haukenæs took it over at book value and then continued it as a private operation.
Folklore collector.
After meeting Peter Christen Asbjørnsen during a collection expedition in Hardanger in the summer of 1870, Haukenæs also started gathering folk material in the district. In 1882 he published a request in several newspapers in Western Norway for people in Hardanger, Voss, and neighboring villages to send him manuscript collections with oral traditions.
In 1883, Haukenæs's business went bankrupt, and at the same time he lost his entire private library. This combination of material distress and poor prospects led Haukenæs to embark on a new endeavor that attracted him; namely to cultivate his new hobby of collecting and publishing folk material. Haukenæs was extremely productive, but did not trust his own writing skills, and so he sought help from the more experienced writer Jon Nilsson Skaar from Botnen at the head of Fykse Sound. He paid Skaar to help him write out and arrange the available material.
In 1890, Haukenæs visited the well-known folklore collector Peder Fylling at his home in Skodje. A travelogue from his trip was published in the newspaper "Sunnmørsposten".
Author and publisher.
In a series of books, Haukenæs presented information about nature, folk life, and folk belief in Hardanger, Sunnhordland, and Voss. He also wrote an autobiography. The print runs were quite small; this, combined with some mishaps—such as some boxes of books that burned during a fire in Granvin in 1885 and a large shipment of books that went down with the steamer "Ole Bull" when the ship was wrecked outside Volda in 1888—has resulted in many of Haukenæs's titles being very rare and hard to obtain.
Haukenæs was successful as an author, and on May 17, 1899 he and his family were able to move into his attractive new home at the Solbakken farm at Eide in Granvin, named after Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson's 1857 peasant novel "Synnøve Solbakken". By the time he turned 60 the next year, Haukenæs had been able to write no fewer than 30 books in 16 years.

Women in the cannabis industry

Women have been active in the cannabis industry, cannabis legalization and cannabis rights, and related issues.
According to some sources, the cannabis industry is a particularly woman-friendly environment and has a higher percentage of women than many other industries for several reasons. Cited reasons include its founding by "liberally minded rebels" less bound by gender conformity; and its being relatively new and "unhampered by established business networks" closed to women, and the lack of glass ceilings in some parts of the industry, especially "support" activities such as finance and investment, marketing, delivery, and agronomy research.

At the J Awards of 2018, the album was nominated for Australian Album of the Year.

In 2018, "The Comedown", was voted into Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2017 at #48, whilst in 2019, "Confidence", "Knees" and "Happy Sad" were voted into Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2018 at numbers 1, 10 and 100, respectively. "Bones" was also voted into the Hottest 200 of 2018 at #166.
Reception.
Riley Fitzgerald from "Music Feeds" said ""Chiaroscuro" is a big, spacious record. 12 tracks arrive crammed full of hooks and loaded with riffs. A radio-friendly rock sound with funk and reggae undercurrents." An ABC staff writer called the album "a sun drenched, genre bending delight".
RJ Frometa from "Vents Magazine" said ""Chiaroscuro" explores the contrast of light and dark, from the hazy, hopeful tones on the paradoxical 'Happy Sad', to the wistful yet commanding howls on 'Knees', and warm, rich rolling guitars on single 'The Comedown'... Each song is drenched in equal parts distortion and dreaminess, pairing blissfully scuzzy riffs with intoxicating echoing vocals, to create the ultimate fusion of psychedelic reggae and laid-back surf rock." Emma Salisbury from "The Music" wrote: "As the album's title suggests, this work explores both light and shade. In a confident step forward, Ocean Alley have crafted a seamless blend of the two within their constantly evolving melting pot of psychedelic and surf rock." A staff writer from "The Newcastle Herald" called the album "a stunning collection of ebbing and flowing tracks; full of slinky bass riffs, epic harmonies and soaring guitar solos."

Callaghan v. Myers

Callaghan v. Myers, 128 U.S. 617 (1888), was a United States Supreme Court ruling dealing with copyright. The firm of Eugene B. Myers &amp; Chandler, composed of Myers and Horace P. Chandler, purchased the copyright of the arrangement of a number of Illinois Supreme Court records compiled by Norman L. Freeman. They printed these works, the Illinois Reports volumes 32 through 38, from 1865 to 1867. Myers alone held the copyright to Freeman's arrangements of volumes 39 through 46 and printed those as well.
The conflict began when Myers made some changes to the arrangement of volumes 37 and 38 and published them, observing the procedure to procure copyright on these alternative works. The defendants, Callaghan &amp; Company, offered to purchase licenses to publish these new versions of 37 and 38, but would not pay Myers's price. Instead, they made very minor changes to Myers's version, copying essentially verbatim the portions of the book that were actually copyrightable, and published it as their own work. Myers sued them for copyright infringement and the case eventually went to the Supreme Court.
The Court upheld earlier case law, such as "Banks v. Manchester", that said court documents belonged to the public domain. In regards to the case at hand, they ruled that the elements of the books that organized or summarized those judicial works constituted intellectual effort and therefore Myers did hold the copyright because he did follow the copyrighting procedures in all cases except one. The Court found that the copies of Volume 32 required for formally copyrighting the work had arrived late, so that volume was not copyrighted. Nonetheless, the plaintiff, Myers, was entitled to compensation in full for the infringement damages, if he chose to collect them.

Not All the Beautiful Things

Not All the Beautiful Things is the debut studio album by Australian musical project What So Not, which is the performing name of DJ and producer, Chris Emerson. It was released on 9 March 2018 through Counter Records and Sweat It Out. What So Not began work on the album after completing a six-year long global tour, which had left him unable to commit fully to working on a studio album. His frequent travels influenced the sound of many of the album's tracks, including "Beautiful" and "Us". What So Not chose the record's title because the "simple pleasures" of life are ignored by people who focus only on their grandiose ideas.
The record contains twelve songs, all featuring production collaborations and performances with a range of artists: Toto, Skrillex, Dyro, Daniel Johns and San Holo. Its songwriting was managed by a list of co-writers, inclusive of Anna Lunoe, Off Bloom and Ryan McMahon of Captain Cuts. The tracks comprise What So Not's signature future bass and trap sounds, while experimenting with other electronic music genres including hip hop, dubstep, and house.
It received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised the featured guests and production quality. The record includes three singles — "Be Ok Again" with Daniel Johns in November 2017, "Stuck in Orbit" with Buoy in January 2018, and "Beautiful" with Winona Oak in February 2018. In support of the album, What So Not embarked on an international tour named the Beautiful Things World Tour which lasted from January to May 2018. It charted in the United States (Dance/Electronic Albums) and Australia (ARIA), peaking at number eight and fourteen respectively.
Background and development.
"Not All the Beautiful Things" was issued by Australian electronic music project, What So Not, also known as Emoh Instead. He had previously released four extended plays (EPs) under his project name. Three of these were co-produced with Australian artist Flume who left the project in February 2015, which at that time What So Not had carried the majority of the project by performing on his own. After touring extensively, What So Not returned to Sydney in 2017 hoping to complete work on a studio-length album, which ultimately became "Not All the Beautiful Things". He had been unable to do so while on the move, saying: "I had a few test runs with EPs and things, particularly with "Divide and Conquer", but I don't think I could have really done an album before this point, because I ended up on tour for almost six years."
What So Not's experiences while performing influenced several of the album's songs. For example, he said the song "Beautiful" was created while he was backpacking and camping in Nicaragua. He had also written multiple tracks in a Nicaraguan songwriting workshop organised by Neon Gold Records. What So Not took on the role of creative director for the first time in his career on "Not All the Beautiful Things". This gave him control over the production, songwriting, film scoring and its direction. He felt this led to a "cohesive narrative" across all creative aspects of the project. It was recorded from 2015 to 2018, in between touring.
What So Not said the record's title was a "tribute to the things we lose along the way when we're striving for things", in particular when individuals focus on "all these grand goals" and "forget everything that's in front of them." He also said the title encompasses the entire narrative of the album and encapsulates his own dramatic endings to personal relationships. The producer said while working on the album he avoided "putting any pressure on [himself]" in the onset and simply tried to have it completed by a certain point. He focused on the record's songwriting and toplining (lyrical writing over a pre-made track). Originally, as many as 100 song demos were made for it, but only 12 tracks that fit the artist's narrative were used. What So Not described its songs as "brutally honest and raw", representing his attempts to "[dive] into the deep end with things [he had] maybe never tried before."
"Not All the Beautiful Things" includes collaborations with other artists the producer describes as people that he has admired and befriended across the years. He said that the collaboration with Daniel Johns occurred during a time when they "randomly crossed paths and hit it off". The collaboration with Toto surprised him as the band had not previously worked with a dance music producer. They reportedly held jam sessions where What So Not would play some chords, a riff, or a drum beat and the band would "riff over the top and do a call and response thing." 
In January 2018, the DJ announced its release date as 9 March via Counter Records / Sweat It Out / Warner Music Australia, and publicised its track list. The record primarily incorporates What So Not's signature trap and future bass sound, while encompassing bass music, hip hop, dubstep, and house. A remix album was later released on 16 November 2018, comprising remixes by eleven different artists including 12th Planet, Marlo and Graves.
An international tour was announced in January 2018, the Beautiful Things World Tour. Lasting from 19 January to 4 May, the event brought the DJ to many international festivals including Ultra, Bonnaroo and Lollapalooza, as well as performances in India, China, Europe, South America and North America. The Australian leg of the tour took in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane in June 2018. What So Not used a new touring rig for his shows, which include a large chrome horse and chariot set-up.
Singles.
The album's first single, "Be Ok Again", was released on 28 November 2017 and featured Australian singer Daniel Johns, former frontman of the rock band Silverchair. The single included uncredited vocals by What So Not, marking his first recorded vocal performance. "Dancing Astronaut" David Klemow described "Be Ok Again" as a future bass track which "plays upon the project's earliest core appeals, returning to fluttering vocal work over bold, bombastic build ups and wiry, off-kilter breaks". What So Not, who described the song as a "really personal track", said it originated during a studio session in 2017 with music and production duo Slumberjack (Morgan Then, Fletcher Ehlers). Daniel Johns was walking by; he invited What So Not to collaborate at the singer's Newcastle studio. Johns had also co-written two more of the record's songs: "If You Only Knew" and "Same Mistakes". He reacted positively to his collaboration with What So Not, stating: "Watching [What So Not] work is eye opening". The track's music video, co-directed with Australian film maker Luke Eblen, was released on 23 January 2018. Eblen had also provided the album's cover art (see above).
"Stuck in Orbit" was released on 30 January 2018 as its second single. It features Sydney-based singer Buoy (Charmian Kingston) and was co-produced with Jono Ma of Australian psychedelic dance band Jagwar Ma. In an emailed statement to "Billboard", What So Not revealed that the song started as a jam with Jona Ma in his film scoring studio (Sonar Music). The vocals "began as a sketch of ad libs from Buoy with only two words, drawn out across the verse 'I ov-er comp-en-sate'". He discovered Buoy's vocals through a local community radio station in Australia. After learning she lived near his parents in Sydney, they met up to collaborate. One night when an airport system crash had left the DJ stranded, he channeled his frustrations musically and came up with the lyrics for "Stuck In Orbit". After returning home he brainstormed the final elements of the vocals with Winona Oak (Johanna Ekmark) and Buoy. The song was recorded through Skype, due to What So Not's busy touring schedule, which made it difficult for him to spend time in his studio.
"Beautiful", featuring Winona Oak, was released on 27 February 2018 as the final single. Critics praised the "hypnotic, carefree aesthetic" of the track which complements Oak's "show-stopping" vocals. What So Not explained the song was constructed in a Nicaraguan songwriting camp where he met Oak, and this influenced the track's sound design. Ryan McMahon of production trio Captain Cuts (Ben Berger, Ryan McMahon, Ryan Rabin) was involved with the vocal ad-libbing of the song. They worked on the idea of "beautiful pain", which led to a song of "optimism, anxiousness and longing, but also an undertone of sadness". House music producer Chris Lake gave him production tips on "how to do a few things I had forgotten."
Reception.
Music critics were generally positive towards "Not All the Beautiful Things", with most praising the collaborations and production values; although some felt parts were too predictable. Matthew Meadow from "Your EDM" complimented the common themes shared between each track and "The Music" Emma Salisbury felt that the "unique flavors" inhabited by the tracks led to a "well-curated, well-rounded work on a bed of exquisite production". The former selected "We Keep On Running" with Toto as his favourite track, citing the "powerful production" and the song's "plucky transform[ation] into distorted rock" at the drop. Hayden Manders of "Nylon" praised the songs where the DJ had "full control", notably the closing track "Us" which she described as a "cosmic journey through a couple's private life in a public sphere". The critic also described the record as a "fully packaged, uncompromised artistic vision", rather than "an electronic dance album filled with singles ripe for remixing but a fully packaged".
The collaborations with other musical artists were also widely praised, with Manders of "Nylon" writing that the artist collaborations "work to a satisfying extent" while Neil Z. Yeung from AllMusic commenting that the collaborations with the "inspired guests and fellow Aussies" resulted in a "pleasant journey through different pockets of electronic dance featuring a handful of synth throbbers and pretty electronic soundscapes". Hampson of "Exclaim!" also called the album's guests "inventive" and lauded the record's promising opening.
However, several elements of "Not All The Beautiful Things" were not as well received by critics, especially its predictability and tendency to sound clumped up. "Exclaim!" Hampson felt the record was predictable after its first two tracks, with songs "capitalizing on uninspired progressions and slopped in a grime we've heard the world over", while AllMusic's Yeung noted that sections of the album occasionally "sound like a mishmash of multiple artists vying for the same spotlight". Contrasting "Your EDM"s opinion, Hampson from "Exclaim!" gave a lukewarm reception to the Toto collaboration, calling it a "bad Top 40 anthem any number of at-the-moment pop stars might throw out."
In Australia, "Not All the Beautiful Things" peaked at number 14 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums chart, surpassing What So Not's previous extended play "Divide &amp; Conquer" which hit number 19. On the ARIA Top 100 Physical Albums and ARIA Digital Albums charts, the record ranked at number twenty-five and number eight respectively. It then peaked at number four on the ARIA Australian Artists Albums chart, and number two on the ARIA Dance Albums chart. The single "Be Ok Again" climbed to number 19 on the ARIA Heatseekers chart, while the Volac, Zeke Beats and Kaz James remixes of "Beautiful" charted for eight weeks on the ARIA Club Tracks charts and peaked at number 17. On the Billboard Dance/Electronic Albums chart, the album peaked at number eight for one week.

The International 2018

The International 2018 (TI8) was the eighth iteration of The International, an annual "Dota 2" world championship esports tournament. Hosted by Valve, the game's developer, TI8 followed a year-long series of tournaments awarding qualifying points, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), with the top eight ranking teams being directly invited to the tournament. In addition, ten more teams earned invites through qualifiers that were held in June 2018, with the group stage and main event played at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver in August. The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3–2. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the open qualifiers and were not favored to win throughout the competition.
As with every International from 2013 onwards, the prize pool was crowdfunded by the "Dota 2" community via its battle pass feature, with the total being over 25 million, making it one of the largest for any esports tournament. Other events took place during the tournament, including a cosplay competition and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize pools, as well as two live demonstration games of a team of professional players playing against a team of five OpenAI-curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, to showcase the capability of machine learning. In addition to nearly 20,000 spectators at the Rogers Arena, the tournament was livestreamed and seen by over 15 million people online. A documentary film following OG and PSG.LGD through the grand finals was released in January 2019. OG would later win The International 2019 the following year, becoming the first repeat champion of the International.
Overview.
"Dota 2" is a 2013 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed by Valve. In it, two teams of five players compete by selecting characters known as "heroes", each with a variety of innate skills and abilities, and cooperate to be the first to destroy the base of the other team, which ends the match. The game is played from a top-down perspective, and the player sees a segment of the game's map near their character as well as mini-map that shows their allies, with any enemies revealed outside the fog of war. The game's map has three roughly symmetric "lanes" between each base, with several defensive towers protecting each side. Periodically, the team's base spawns a group of weak CPU-controlled creatures, called "creeps", that march down each of the three lanes towards the opponents' base, fighting any enemy hero, creep, or structure they encounter. If a hero character is killed, that character respawns back at their base after a delay period, which gets progressively longer the farther into the match.
As with previous years of the tournament, a corresponding battle pass for "Dota 2" was released in May 2018, allowing the prize pool to be crowdfunded by players of the game. Known as the "Compendium", 25% of revenue made by it was sent directly towards the tournament's prize pool, which Valve started at a base 1.6 million. At the time of event, "Dota 2" featured 115 playable characters, called "heroes". Prior to each game in the tournament, a draft was held between the opposing team captains to select which heroes their teams use, going back and forth until each side has banned six and selected five heroes. Once a hero is picked, it cannot be selected by any other player that match, so teams used the draft to strategically plan ahead and deny the opponent's heroes that may be good counters or would be able to take advantage of weaknesses to their current lineup. The first pick in a match is decided by a pre-game coin toss, and then alternates between each game in that series. The team that does not get first pick gets the option of which side of the map to play on, a strategic benefit.
Format.
A change from previous Internationals, The International 2018 featured a series of tournaments running from October 2017 until June 2018, known as the Dota Pro Circuit (DPC), that awarded qualifying points with the top eight ranking teams receiving direct invitations.&lt;ref name="Majors/Minors Kotaku"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Majors/Minors PC Gamer"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time since The International 2013, the main event was not held at the KeyArena in Seattle, due to it undergoing renovation construction at the time, and was instead held at the Rogers Arena in Vancouver, Canada from August 20–25, 2018. The event was also broadcast on a number of livestreams, such as on Twitch and Steam.tv, with the latter being introduced specifically for the tournament. As with most major "Dota 2" tournaments, the event had English, Chinese, and Russian-language broadcasting crews, with all of them having a large group of dedicated analysts and game casters.
The eight DPC teams to earn invites were Virtus.pro, PSG.LGD, Team Liquid, Team Secret, Mineski, Vici Gaming, Newbee, and VGJ.Thunder. In addition, twelve open qualifier single-elimination playoff brackets, two from each region, were held from June 14–18, 2018, with any eligible team able to participate in them, including non-professional ones. Winners of them advanced to the main qualifiers, which were held from June 18–25 and consisted of six regional brackets where an additional ten teams, Team Serenity, Invictus Gaming, Winstrike Team, OG, VGJ.Storm, Evil Geniuses, OpTic Gaming, paiN Gaming, Fnatic, and TNC Predator, earned invites by winning their respective regions.
To seed the elimination bracket for the main event, two separate round robin group stages featuring all 18 teams were played from August 15–18. Each of the teams played each other within their group in a two-game series. The top four placing teams of each group advanced to the upper bracket, while the fifth through eight advanced to the lower bracket. The lowest placed team from both groups were eliminated from the competition. The main event featured two brackets, an upper and lower, in a double-elimination tournament format. Winning teams of the upper bracket, played in a best-of-three match format, advanced to the next round, while the losing team would then be placed in respective rounds of the lower bracket. The winner of the upper bracket moved to the grand finals. Teams who were seeded into the lower bracket from the group stage played best-of-one games, with the loser being immediately eliminated. All later round matches in the lower bracket were played to best-of-three, with the winner of the lower bracket advancing to the grand finals, played as a best-of-five series, to face the winner of the upper bracket.

Grand Finals.
The best-of-five grand finals took place between OG and PSG.LGD, with OG winning the series 3–2. While PSG.LGD earned an direct invite to the tournament by finishing third in the 2017–2018 Dota Pro Circuit standings, OG earned theirs by playing through and winning the European open qualifiers, which they were required to do per tournament rules following a roster shuffle after three members, Tal "Fly" Aizik, Gustav "s4" Magnusson, and Roman "Resolut1on" Fominok left the team in May 2018. Needing three new members just two weeks before the qualifiers began, OG quickly signed Topias "Topson" Taavitsainen, a newcomer to the scene who had never performed at a major LAN event prior to the event, Anathan "ana" Pham, a former member of the team who had taken a year-long break following their previous elimination at The International 2017, and Sébastien "Ceb" Debs, who had previously served as the team's coach.
Following their win at the European qualifiers, OG were then placed into group A, finishing fourth with a record of 9–7, which seeded them into the upper bracket. There, OG won every series to advance to the grand finals. Facing the lower bracket winner PSG.LGD in it, whom OG had just defeated in the upper bracket finals, OG won the game one, but lost the next two games. Needing another win to avoid losing the series, OG forced a late-game comeback in game four, and subsequently won game five, making them International champions and winning them over 11 million in prize money. Their victory was considered a Cinderella and underdog success story, as they had come from the open qualifiers and had beaten some of the more favored and accomplished teams along the way. Their win also broke the historical trend of Chinese teams winning the International in even years. OG would also later win The International 2019 the following year, becoming the first repeat champion of an International.
Legacy.
At the time, The International 2018 set an crowdfunded esport prize pool record by eclipsing the previous years' record, finalizing at 25,532,177. Other related events took place during the tournament, such as a cosplay and submitted short film contest with their own independent prize pools. In addition, two live demonstrations of a team of professional players playing against a team of five OpenAI-curated bots, known as the OpenAI Five, took place to showcase the capability of machine learning. Although the bots lost both games, the first against paiN Gaming and the second against an all-star team of former Chinese players, they were considered a success by OpenAI who stated that due to the bots playing against some of the best players in "Dota 2", it allowed them to analyze and adjust their algorithms for future games.
Attendees of the event at the Rogers Arena were given a free copy of "Artifact", a then-upcoming "Dota 2"-themed digital collectible card game. New content for the game itself was also revealed during the event, including two new playable heroes and a Gabe Newell voice pack. The tournament was seen by over 15 million people online, with nearly 20,000 attending the matches at the Rogers Arena. The tournament, alongside OG's upset win over PSG.LGD, were respectively nominated for "best esports event" and "best esports moment" at The Game Awards 2018 ceremony. An episode of "True Sight", Valve's documentary film series on the professional "Dota 2" scene, was filmed during the event. It followed OG and PSG.LGD during the grand finals, documenting a number of behind the scenes moments for both teams before and after matches. It was released online for free on January 15, 2019, and also premiered to a live audience, with members of OG as special guests, at the Palads Teatret in Copenhagen.

Pursuance

Pursuance is the third full-length studio album from melodic hardcore band, Only Crime. The album was released on May 13, 2014 and is the band's first studio album to feature bassist Dan Kelly, formerly a member of the punk rock band The Frisk and guitarist Matt Hoffman, formerly of the punk band Modern Life is War. Pursuance is the band's first album to be released on Rise Records, having the previous two studio albums released on Fat Wreck Chords. The album was produced by Bill Stevenson and was recorded at Stevenson's own recording studio The Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Critical reception.
"Pursuance" received positive reviews from critics, with the website Dying Scene praising the album for its more melodic sound it showcases compared to the previous studio albums, but still with plenty of anger. Dying Scene also stated in the review that with the band's first two albums being more focused on hardcore punk, this album was "both a natural progression and a bit of a departure". The review also mentioned the album's "bitter lyrics collide with almost metal guitar riffs" and that the "discordant riffs tie the album together in a very satisfyingly pissed off package".
"Richard Cocksedge" of Punknews wrote "Where To The Nines failed to ignite my passion, Pursuance is full of fire and brimstone, bringing to the fore the qualities that you would expect from the five members of the band. I still don't like the term 'supergroup' but Only Crime have shown that the bringing together of a variety of people, skilled at their chosen field, can bear fruit. Pursuance is an album lacking filler and sets a high standard for melodic hardcore with its invigorating suite of songs."

<doc id="56852429" url="?curid=56852429" title="Battery torque wrench">
Battery torque wrench

A battery torque wrench is a battery-operated torque wrench that can apply a specified torque without effort from the operator. It contains a planetary torque multiplier or a gearbox. A reaction device that absorbs the torque rather than the tool operator. The torque output is adjusted by varying the voltage on the motor. The battery torque wrench is used to remove stubborn nuts, or to apply accurate torque. The gearboxes can have multiplication ratios up to 125:1. 
The battery torque wrench is sometimes confused with a standard impact wrench, due to their similar appearance. A battery torque wrench is driven by continuous gearing, and not by the hammers of an impacting wrench. A battery torque wrench has very little vibration, and excellent repeatability and accuracy.
The benefit of a battery torque wrench is its capability to operate independently of an outside power source, making them useful for applications that require work in tight spaces such as oil or gas pipelines. They also come with electronic features not found on pneumatic wrenches.
In addition, newer wrench models weigh much less than older battery-powered tools and feature an automatic release function which activates once torque is applied to the bolt. 
Meanwhile, advancements in battery technology have doubled the life of the batteries used in these wrenches. Newer battery-powered wrenches also allow for brushless motors, leading to a longer motor life. 
Torque capabilities of battery torque wrenches range from 115 Nm, up to a maximum of 6,500 Nm. (84 Ft lbs - 4794 Ft lbs)
The first large-capacity brushless battery torque wrench was invented in Germany in 2013.
Before the brushless motor with micro electronics was introduced, the battery torque wrench was not as accurate as it could be.
Because of the power limitations of the accurate motor, the tool has 2 speeds: one for speed, and one for power.
Battery requirements.
A brushless battery motor using lithium-ion battery is the most common source of power for battery torque wrenches. The voltage required is designated by the amp hours of a battery. A complete battery with lower ampere hour must have higher voltage, and a physically larger size, to make up for loss of capacity, and vice versa. Manufacturing a battery motor that can handle higher-Ampere hour batteries are more costly, and the internal electronics are more complicated. The more complex the electronics, the more accurate the motor is when shutting off at a desired torque value. A very common battery combination would be compact 18 volt with a 5.2-ampere hour capacity. This combination varies by manufacturer.
Torque verification.
Torque can be verified by a transducer mounted on the outside of the gearbox, connecting to the output shaft of the tool.
This transducer can wireless talk via Bluetooth to a mobile smartphone app.
This allows the creation of reports, to export incredibly accurate bolting data.
In addition, these battery torque wrenches come with a certificate of calibration.
The output of these tools can be adjusted by a potentiometer at the calibration facility.

Sugar Shuffle

"Sugar Shuffle" is a song written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Blue. It first appeared as the lead-in track on de Paul's album "Love Bomb" as an ethereal, chilled and dreamy song about nightlife and dating. AllMusic rated "Sugar Shuffle" as one of de Paul's song highlights. Musician and music critic Bob Stanley wrote in "The Guardian", "Sugar Shuffle is an especially gorgeous, woozy mid-70s confection, fit to sit at the table with Liverpool Express’s You Are My Love".
Although never released as a single in de Paul's UK home market, it was released in edited form as a single in the US, where it was play-listed by radio stations such as KBBC-Phenix and in Japan, where it was backed by the song "Dreams". In the US, de Paul version received positive reviews in "Record World" and "Cashbox". Most recently it was played on Flaneur Radio: MacArthur Park and France's Radio Nova, played by Bill Brewster.
An updated cover version of the song was released on the 1984 album "Cryptograph" by the Japanese artist Asami Kobayashi (小林麻美). This version had lyrics by Kobayshi and Yumi Matsutoya. It received the "Best Album" award at the 26th Annual Japan Record Awards (Nihon Record Taisho) and reached the top 10 in the Japanese album chart in 1984.
The song was released on CD in the US as a track on the Renaissance Records release of "Love Bomb" in 2010. A remastered version of the de Paul version of the song was finally released on CD on her 2013 compilation CD "Into My Music". The song is also a track on the 2020 album "Bob Stanley presents 76 In The Shade" with Martin Ruddock highlighting it as one of the standout tracks, writing in his review of the album "The poolside cool of Lynsey De Paul’s sedate Sugar Shuffle". The album entered the Dutch compilations chart at No. 23.

Citroën C3 R5/Rally2

The Citroën C3 Rally2 (originally known as the Citroën C3 R5) is a rally car built by Citroën World Rally Team. It is based upon the Citroën C3 road car and is built to R5 regulations. The car made its début at the 2018 Tour de Corse where it was driven by the French crews of Stéphane Lefebvre and Gabin Moreau, and Yoann Bonato and Benjamin Boulloud.
Background.
In early 2017, Citroën began the development of the C3 R5. The C3 would be designed to improve on the previous offerings of Groupe PSA in the R5 discipline, the Peugeot 208 T16 and the Citroën DS3 R5, both of which proved problematic and unpopular with R5 customers. The C3 had little relation to its predecessor, the DS3. 
Development.
Throughout summer 2017, Citroën Racing Technologies employed factory Citroën drivers Stéphane Lefebvre and Craig Breen as part of the development team for the C3, along with Yoann Bonato, who was hired for the project. The first working model was completed in September of 2017, and a month later the test C3 made its public debut at the Rallye du Var, with Bonato driving a few stages as a non-competitive entrant to the rally.
Competition.
The Citroën C3 R5 passed international homologation on 1 January 2018, and was now ready for competition. It made its competitive rallying debut at the Tour de Corse in April of that year, with Yoann Bonato taking second place in the WRC-2 class, and 10th overall in the rally.
Including the original test cars, a total of 26 C3 R5s had been constructed by 1 May 2019, with 22 having been sold to independent teams. In the hands of Yoann Bonato, the C3 R5 won the French Rally Championship in 2018, and continues to be used by the Citroën World Rally Team in the WRC-2 Pro class of the World Rally Championship, in the hands of Mads Østberg. Østberg would give the C3 R5 its first World Championship-level victory at the 2019 Rally Argentina. Although Citroën withdrew from the World Rally Championship in 2020, it continued as a manufacturer team in the WRC-2 and made the C3 R5 available to privateer teams in the WRC-3.
The C3 R5 was renamed the Citroën C3 Rally2 ahead of the 2021 championships.

Stanley Morgan (politician)

Stanley James Wells Morgan (1870 – 16 December 1951) was a British reverend, trade union organiser, and politician.
Born in Poplar, London, Morgan was active in the Congregational Church, and was appointed as its minister in Greenhithe, Kent, in 1894.
Morgan was appointed as chairman of the West Hill Hospital Board in 1910, serving for twenty-five years. His particular interest lay in mental health, and when, in 1921, the National Asylum Workers' Union (NAWU) and the Poor Law Workers' Trade Union decided to appoint a London and Southern Regional Organiser, he took the post. Although the Poor Law Workers' union withdrew from the arrangement the following year, the NAWU kept him on, and he remained in post until 1937, when he retired.
Morgan also became active in the Labour Party, representing Dartford on Kent County Council for many years. He was appointed as an alderman, but when the council was restructured in 1949, he decided instead to stand for his old Dartford seat again, and was successful.
Morgan contested numerous Parliamentary elections for the Labour Party: in Faversham at the 1918, 1922, 1923 and 1924 United Kingdom general elections, and then in Epsom at the 1929, 1931 and 1935 general elections. He was never elected, his best result being 47.9% of the vote in Faversham in 1923.
After retiring from trade union work, Morgan continued in his religious post. During World War II, he led services in a chalk tunnel at Greenhithe, which was being used as an air raid shelter.

Wrangel Mansion

Wrangel Mansion () is a building in Rostov-on-Don, built in 1885 by architect Nikolay Doroshenko. In this house Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel, one of the main leaders of the White Movement, spent his childhood and youth years. Wrangel Mansion has the status of an object of cultural heritage of regional significance. At present, the building is in poor condition and needs to be repaired.
History.
The mansion in Kazansky (now Gazetny) lane was built in 1885 by architect Nikolai Aleksandrovich Doroshenko. The house first belonged to different owners, but soon it was bought by Baron Nikolai Egorovich Wrangel who moved in here with his family. Nikolai Egorovich was an art critic, a writer and collector of antiques. His wife Maria Dmitrievna is known as women who initiated establishment of the first women's Sunday school in Rostov-on-Don. Their eldest son, Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel, became one of the leaders of the White movement during the Civil War in Russia.
After the end of the Civil War the building was nationalized and used to house a kindergarten. In the 1990s, the kindergarten was closed and since then the building was in desolation. By the decree of the Head of Administration of Rostov Oblast issued on October 9, 1998, Wrangel House was placed under state protection as an object of cultural heritage of regional significance. In 2006, the building was handed over to Rostov Diocese under the condition of carrying out works to restore it. The Diocese planned to restore the building and establish an educational center and museum in it. In 2011, it was planned to establish a museum of Alexander Solzhenitsyn with an exposition that would be devoted to an epoch, contemporal to both Solzhenitsyn and Wrangel. However, the Diocese was unable to find funds for the restoration of Wrangel House. Only in 2012, the roof was replaced and temporary double-glazed windows were installed. In general, for the past six years, the building has come to an extremely deplorable state. In September 2011, a public action was held near the building to draw attention to the state of the architectural monument. In March 2013 Rostov Diocese sold the house of Wrangel for 9 million rubles and spent them to repair Cathedral of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin. The new owner of the building became "Management of Mechanization", Ltd.
In 2015, the issue of demolishing a house and erecting a copy of it at the same place was raised at a meeting of the city administration. The restoration of the architectural monument was estimated at 130 million rubles, and the construction of a copy — only 20. The idea of demolishing the building was strongly criticized by the public.
Architecture.
The main facade of the building has a rich decor. The main entrance is accented by a two-columned Doric portico, topped with a rectangular attic. In the interior, the old stucco molding has been partially preserved.

Journey Thru an Electric Tube

Journey Thru an Electric Tube is an album by American jazz vibraphonist Mike Mainieri first released in 1968 on the Solid State label.
Critical reception.
The Allmusic review by Tony Wilds said ""Journey Through an Electric Tube" is not likely to be high on anyone's list, just as Mainieri is an obscure vibist. "Journey" may well be a cash-in on Dave Pike's success with "The Doors of Perception" and similar works. "Journey" features excellent ideas and playing and of course Sonny Lester's top direction. ... It is all low-volume, pleasant, and never-abrasive, however. Call it gently experimental, forward-looking without being too forward or pretentious".
Track listing.

List of historic properties in Yuma, Arizona

This is a list of historic properties in Yuma, Arizona, which includes a photographic gallery of some of the remaining historic structures and monuments. Yuma is the county seat of Yuma County, Arizona, United States. It is located in the southwestern corner of the state. Yuma is the site of one of the few National Historic Landmarks in the Southwest. Included in this list are photographs of some of the structures within the Yuma Downtown Historic District, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, which today is a state historic park and the Yuma Territorial Prison a Yuma landmark.
Brief history.
The area where the city of Yuma is located was once occupied by the Yuma tribe, also known as the Quechan. Hernando de Alarcón and Melchior Diaz were Spanish Conquistadors who in 1540 visited the area during the Spanish colonial expeditions. They believed that the narrow crossing of the Colorado River would be ideal for the establishment of a city.
At first the relations between the Yuman and the Spaniards was cordial, however the relation between the two became hostile and the Yuman were forced to submit to the rule of the Spanish government and most were enslaved.
In 1853, Yuma ceased to be part of Mexico and became a United States Territory (New Mexico Territory) as a result of Gadsden Purchase. The United States established Fort Yuma and an influx of settlers and farmers of European descent invaded the area. The Yuma Crossing was ideal during and after the California Gold Rush to the late 1870s. It was known for its ferry crossings for the Southern Emigrant Trail.
The Yuma tribe fiercely resisted the invasion of their homelands and fought against the US in the Yuma War (1850–1853). They were defeated and were forced to move to Indian Reservations such as the one in western Yuma County in what eventually become the State of Arizona.
In 1853, Arizona City, a small settlement was established on the high grounds across Fort Yuma. The settlement continued to grow and the government established the Yuma Quartermaster Depot. From 1864, the Yuma Quartermaster Depot, today a state historic park, supplied all forts in present-day Arizona, as well as large parts of Colorado and New Mexico. After Arizona became a separate territory, Yuma became the county seat for Yuma County in 1871, replacing La Paz County, the first seat. Arizona City was renamed Yuma in 1873.
Yuma County Historical Society.
The mission of the Yuma County Historical Society is to preserve the structures of historic significance in the city and county of Yuma. To this end the society has teamed up with the Arizona Historical Society. They collaborated in restoration of the E. F. Sanguinetti (1867–1945) House located at 240 S. Madison Ave. It serves as the home to the Arizona Historical Society museum. Among the plans of the society is the restoration of the historic adobe Molina Block, Yuma's first commercial building.
The Historic Preservation and Architectural Design Staff works with the Design and Historic Review Commission (DHRC) to promote and protect the historic and architectural integrity of the City of Yuma. However, Yuma's preservation office does not have the ability to deny a demolition permit. Therefore, the owner of a property, listed in the National Register of Historic Places, may demolish the historical property if he or she so wishes. According to Jim McPherson, Arizona Preservation Foundation Board President:

The Yuma Territorial Prison was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. The prison also has a "Dark Room" in which some prisoners were sent for solitary confinement as a formof punishment. During the next 33 years, 3,069 prisoners were incarcerated there, including 29 women. Among the notable prisoners was Jack Swilling, a.k.a. the "Father of Phoenix", who was accused and incarcerated for a crime that he did not commit. Swilling died in the prison in 1878. Also, among those incarcerated were:

Yuma Quartermaster Depot.
The Yuma Crossing is a site in Arizona and California that is significant for its association with transportation and communication across the Colorado River during the Spanish colonial and the American expansion eras. The Yuma Quartermaster Depot served as a historic Army supply depot that operated during Arizona's Indian Wars period from 1865 to 1883. The supplies gathered at the quartermaster depot, which is located along the Colorado River, were shipped throughout the southwest via river boats and overland on mule team freight wagons. Up to 900 mules were kept in stables at Yuma Quartermaster Depot. Pictured are the following images related to the Yuma Crossing and the Yuma Quartermaster Depot in the Yuma Quartermaster Depot State Historic Park.

Anton Wolfradt

Anton Franz Wolfradt, O.Cist., O.S.B. (9 July 1582, Cologne – 1 April 1639, Vienna) was a Cistercian and Benedictine, Abbot of Wilhering then Kremsmünster, Prince-Bishop of Vienna, and President of the .
Biography.
Anton Wolfradt was the son of a tailor. He first began studying Philosophy at the Collegium Germanicum in Rome in 1599. He entered the Cistercian Order in 1601, and in 1604 made solemn profession at Heiligenkreuz Abbey. He then studied Theology in Rome, graduated with a doctorate in Theology and was ordained a priest on 21 October 1607.
In 1608 he taught at the Rein Abbey near Graz and was consecutively from 1609 the parson of Gratwein. By the recommendation of Cardinal Khlesl he was confirmed on 21 November 1612 to be Abbot of Wilhering in Upper Austria.
Since the monks of the Benedictine Kremsmünster Abbey chose him as their abbot, Pope Paul V allowed a transfer to the Benedictine Order and Wolfradt took to the new office on 15 December 1613. He began with the reform of the monastery and also took on the neighboring abbeys Schlierbach, Gleink and .
Because of his skills in administrative and financial matters, Emperor Ferdinand II appointed him in 1620 to his council and in October 1623 President of the Court Chamber (). Together with the Imperial coin merchant , he was commissioned by Emperor Ferdinand to counteract the coinage that had been created in the Kipper und Wipper era. He was also used as a negotiator with the rebellious farmers in Upper Austria and Albrecht von Wallenstein. In 1628, Wolfradt, with Heinrich von Salburg-Falkenstein and Johann Spindler von Hofegg, served as the provisional governing body of Upper Austria, this was forfeited after eight years of negotiations with Bavaria. The office of Hofkammer president, stressful due of the enormous debts of the Emperor, kept Wolfradt until 1630.
In 1630, Cardinal Khlesl proposed him as coadjutor in Vienna. On 15 February 1631, the Emperor appointed him Bishop of Vienna; the Papal confirmation took place on May 26. On the 2nd of August, the Emperor raised him to the rank of Imperial prince, and the following day he was consecrated bishop. Neither Ferdinand II nor Ferdinand III had succeeded in their efforts to obtain the cardinalate for Wolfradt.
In 1633 he belonged, together with Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg and Maximilian von und zu Trauttmansdorff, to those who considered Wallenstein a conspirator and advised Ferdinand II to arrest him.
As a bishop, he sought by religious instruction and preaching to achieve a reconciliation of the Protestants with the Catholic faith. For this he promoted the Jesuit Order both in Vienna and Bohemia.
His motto, "If the Lord does not will it, there is no use," became very popular, a well-known Viennese song made use of this line.
He is buried in the "Katharinenkapelle" of Vienna's St. Stephen's Cathedral. The self-written epitaph reads: "In my life I was abbot, bishop, prince – now I am dust, shadow, nothing." In 1894 the Wolfrathplatz in Vienna-Hietzing was named after him.

I am from Xinjiang on the Silk Road

I am from Xinjiang on the Silk Road is a documentary telling the story of 18 Xinjiang people in contemporary China. The film seeks to record the perspective of people with real experiences in order to present the status and dreams of those from Xinjiang. The documentary shows how people from Xinjiang integrate themselves into a society with different nationalities and cultures, attempts to dispel preconceptions of Xinjiang, and shows ordinary people's everyday lives.
The six-episode large-scale documentary was produced by Shanghai Jianghan Culture Investment Development Co., Ltd., and was jointly produced by the People's Political Consultative Conference Culture Media Co., Ltd., Suizhong Holdings, and the Beijing Dianyi Culture Communication Center. Director Chen Xiaoqing of "A Bite of China" served as advisor, director and actor Chen Jianbin as artistic director, actress Tong Liya, initiator of the Yanran Fund Li Yapeng as the co-producer. The former author Kurbanjan Semat as the general director and chief producer. A book has been published about the experiences of Xinjiang people based on the series. It records the experiences of the photographer Kurbanjan Samat and 100 of his Xinjiang subjects who work and live in Mainland China on which "I am from Xinjiang on the Silk Road" is based.
Background.
The documentary series was planned and directed by an Uygur Kurbanjan Samat (قۇربانجان سەمەت). The original story of more than 100 ordinary Xinjiang people working and living in different ages, ethnic groups, occupations, and was recorded in shots and words by Kurbanjan. These images show that contemporary Xinjiang people who try to achieve their dreams. Xinjiang is located in the most western part of China that accounts for one-sixth of China’s territory with distinct geographical and cultural features. It has 20 million people of different nations who live in their own cultural traditions. However, for many Chinese and other people, Xinjiang is still a mysterious and unfamiliar topic. The media coverage of Xinjiang is mostly about the deserts, the poverty in the region, its fruit produce, and the song and dance of the people there.

Compared to the caves that have been discovered in Vietnam such as Huong Tich, Thien Cung, Phong Nha - Ke Bang, the Hua Mak cave is no worse than the stalactites of stalactites millions of years old. Hua Ma is also known as "Suspension Cave" because it lies in the middle of the mountain, with an entrance to the east and a passageway to the south. The cave looks down into the waters of Ba Be Lake.
From 2003 to 2004, Hua Ma cave was surveyed and put into operation tourism since 2007. Bac Kan province has invested in lighting systems and roads to the cave. Along with Ba Be lake, Pac Ngoi village, Hua Ma cave is determined to form a key tourism complex of Bac Kan province.
Legend of the cave Huama.
According to the people living here, the old Forest Ghost is the place where the devil reigns. In the afternoon, the cries from the cave of Hua Ma hope to shock the whole area until late at night, the people in the area no one dared to travel in that time.
On that day a royal general went on a march through here, when it came to the river Leng, it was nearly dark. The horse was about to turn to the side to rest, but strangely, when crossing the Leng River, down to the water, the horse turned his head back, echoing as if signaling something unusual. At the same time from the cave Leo, the howling, the oan soul cry out. Seeing strange things, the officer called the villagers to know that the cry is the soul of the soldiers trapped in the cave, were attacked by the cave door to die but souls are not escaped.
Understanding the situation, the chieftain camp right next to the banks of the river Leng and slaughter horses, horse head to worship heaven and earth. Strangely, when the sacrifice was finished, the inanimate voice of the deceased and then gradually disappear, where over the years have sprung up the stalactites are very special, there are places like stone flowers, there are places like Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara teaches the Tripitaka teacher to go to business, there is a place like a palace, palace in the "Palace". From there it is called "Lèn Pèn" which is Hua Ma or the local dialect called Ngo Ngua Cave means "head of house," to memorize a mysterious and legendary area of land and people here.
Geographic Value of Huama cave..
Over millions of years, sedimentary rocks have created spectacular stalactites and stalagmites, with many special shapes.

Bonding molecular orbital

The bonding orbital is used in molecular orbital (MO) theory to describe the attractive interactions between the atomic orbitals of two or more atoms in a molecule. In MO theory, electrons are portrayed to move in waves. When more than one of these waves come close together, the in-phase combination of these waves produces an interaction that leads to a species that is greatly stabilized. The result of the waves’ constructive interference causes the density of the electrons to be found within the binding region, creating a stable bond between the two species.
Diatomic molecules.
In the classic example of the H2 MO, the two separate H atoms have identical atomic orbitals. When creating the molecule dihydrogen, the individual valence orbitals, 1"s", either: merge in phase to get bonding orbitals, where the electron density is in between the nuclei of the atoms; or, merge out of phase to get antibonding orbitals, where the electron density is everywhere around the atom except for the space between the nuclei of the two atoms. Bonding orbitals lead to a more stable species than when the two hydrogens are monatomic. Antibonding orbitals are less stable because, with very little to no electron density in the middle, the two nuclei (holding the same charge) repulse each other. Therefore, it would require more energy to hold the two atoms together through the antibonding orbital. Each electron in the valence 1"s" shell of hydrogen come together to fill in the stabilizing bonding orbital. So, hydrogen prefers to exist as a diatomic, and not monatomic, molecule.
When looking at helium, the atom holds two electrons in each valence 1"s" shell. When the two atomic orbitals come together, they first fill in the bonding orbital with two electrons, but unlike hydrogen, it has two electrons left, which must then go to the antibonding orbital. The instability of the antibonding orbital cancels out the stabilizing effect provided by the bonding orbital; therefore, dihelium's bond order is 0. This is why helium would prefer to be monatomic over diatomic.
Polyatomic molecules.
Bonding MOs of pi bonds.
Pi bonds are created by the “side-on” interactions of the orbitals. Once again, in molecular orbitals, bonding pi (π) electrons occur when the interaction of the two π atomic orbitals are in-phase. In this case, the electron density of the π orbitals need to be symmetric along the mirror plane in order to create the bonding interaction. Asymmetry along the mirror plane will lead to a node in that plane and is described in the antibonding orbital, π*.
An example of a MO of a simple conjugated π system is butadiene. To create the MO for butadiene, the resulting π and π* orbitals of the previously described system will interact with each other. This mixing will result in the creation of 4 group orbitals (which can also be used to describe the π MO of any diene): π1 contains no vertical nodes, π2 contains one and both are considered bonding orbitals; π3 contains 2 vertical nodes, π4 contains 3 and are both considered antibonding orbitals.
Localized molecular orbitals.
The spherical 3D shape of "s" orbitals have no directionality in space and "px", "py", and "pz" orbitals are all 90o with respect to each other. Therefore, in order to obtain orbitals corresponding to chemical bonds to describe chemical reactions, Edmiston and Ruedenberg pioneered the development of localization procedures. For example, in CH4, the four electrons from the 1"s" orbitals of the hydrogen atoms and the valence electrons from the carbon atom (2 in "s" and 2 in "p") occupy the bonding molecular orbitals, σ and π. The delocalized MOs of the carbon atom in the molecule of methane can then be localized to give four "sp"3 hybrid orbitals.
Applications.
Molecular orbitals and, more specifically, the bonding orbital is a theory that is taught in all different areas of chemistry, from organic to physical and even analytical, because it is widely applicable. Organic chemists use molecular orbital theory in their thought rationale for reactions; analytical chemists use it in different spectroscopy methods; physical chemists use it in calculations; it is even seen in materials chemistry through band theory—an extension of molecular orbital theory.

Wake (opera)

Wake is an opera with music by Giorgio Battistelli to a libretto by Sarah Woods. It was premiered on 14 March 2018 by Birmingham Opera Company, in a production by Graham Vick.
The opera, which lasts about 80 minutes, is based on the story of the raising of Lazarus. The production involved participation by non-professionals and audience, who were asked on entry to don veils in mourning for the deceased Lazarus.
Reviews of the opera were mixed. "The Stage" described the work as an "ambitious immersive opera that lacks clarity" in which the audience is steered around four trailer platforms to be confronted with a variety of scenes including police violence and gay exclusion. "The Times" found Batistelli's score "diffuse, [with] dated and forgettable avante-garde effects that Penderecki and Berio were doing better half a century ago", and concluded that "unlike Lazarus, it's not likely to be revived." However, it received five stars from the Birmingham Post, who described it as "a sold out success" and stated that "Wake continues BOC's record of combining innovation and engagement with sheer quality". The Arts Desk also wrote an enthusiastic review, describing the piece as "a musical-dramatic experience that leaves you with ears buzzing, mind racing, and ready to reassess everything you thought you knew about opera".

Order of the Crown of Selangor

The Most Illustrious Order of the Crown of Selangor (Bahasa Melayu: "Darjah Kebesaran Mahkota Selangor Yang Amat Mulia") is an order awarded by Sultan of Selangor as a reward for general services to the sultan and state of Selangor. It was founded in 1961. The order is awarded to the relatives of the Sultan of Selangor as well as high-ranking individuals who have contributed excellence to the Sultan of Selangor and the Sultan's Government. The Sultan also has the right to bestow this Degree of Excellence to anyone whom he deems fit and appropriate to receive it.
Classes.
The four classes of appointment to the Order are, in descending order of precedence:
Seri Paduka Mahkota Selangor (SPMS) can only be awarded to two people at one time and the maximum number of recipients is 40 people. 
Dato Paduka Mahkota Selangor (DPMS) can be awarded up to 20 people at one time and the maximum number of recipients is 600 people.
Styles.
Male recipients of Seri Paduka Mahkota Selangor (SPMS) will carry the title Dato' Seri and their female spouse Datin Seri. Female recipients of the order will carry the title Datin Paduka Seri. Husband to the female recipients will not carry any title. The title "Dato' Seri" is a new title that has been approved in a State Executive Council meeting dated 23 December 1998 on the consent of the Sultan of Selangor. Previously, male recipients use the title Dato' and his spouse Datin, while Datin Paduka is the title given to female recipients. 
Male recipients of Dato Paduka Mahkota Selangor (DPMS) will carry the title Dato' and their female spouse Datin. Female recipients of the order will carry the title Datin Paduka. Husbands of female recipients will not carry any title.
Recipients of Setia Mahkota Selangor (SMS) and Ahli Mahkota Selangor (AMS) will not carry any title.
Appearance.
Knight Grand Commander.
It is awarded in a set of breast star, a collar, a badge and a red coloured sash with a yellow stripe, worn from right shoulder to the left waist.
The collar is made of silver-plated metal and enamel. It is worn on the same length at the front and back. For male recipients, the collar is 100.6 cm long while it is 78.74 cm for female recipients. The differences is because the female's collar is designed to be worn at the neck so it is made without the two chain link in the middle of the male's collar. This necklace has 14 connecting chain link for male, and 12 for female. The two middle chains contain two frames of the Selangor flag that are combined with crescent moon and star. To his left and right are two rubber leaves compositions. All these compositions are made of enamel.
The rest of the chain links are round in shape and adorned with coconut leaves around them. These compositions are arranged into four pairs, each of which contains three different types of chromatic compositions, the first containing the word Selangor in jawi, the second contains two crossed fragments of coconut leaves, and the third contains crescent and stars. Each of these compositions is made of shadowed thin, red enamel metal.
The breast star is made of silver-plated metal, its surface length is 6.985 cm long and has five arise fractions, complete with circles at the end of each of these fractions, and made of red enamel metal. In the center of this star is a circle of 3.175 cm long bearing the symbol of Selangor state with yellow enamel as the base.
The badge is made of silver-plated metal. It is five pointed and decorated just like the breast star. It is also decorated with the engraving of the Selangor State Emblem on red enamel. This badge is made to be suspended on the collar or sash.
The sash is made of red silk cloth 10.16 cm in width for male, 5.715 cm for female, with a 2.54 cm wide yellow band in the center.
Knight Commander.
It is awarded in a set of breast star, a badge and a red coloured sash with a yellow stripe, worn from right shoulder to the left waist.
The shape and size of the badge is the same as the Knight Grand Commander's except the symbols are shown on a flat background, replacing the engraved emblem in the red enamel background in the former. The breast star is also of the same size and shape as Knight Grand Commander's but without the five-pointed silver star.
The male sash is made of 10 cm wide red silk cloth with a 2 cm wide yellow band in the middle. To the left and right of the band are two 0.35 cm wide red strips and two 0.35 cm wide yellow strips. The female sash is 5.7 cm in width with a 1.14 cm wide yellow band in its center. Similar to the male sash, it has two red strips and two yellow strips, both are 0.19 cm wide to the right of the yellow band in the middle of the sash.
The sash was included in the award from 25 February 1999.

Junortoun, Victoria

Junortoun is a suburb of Bendigo, Victoria, Australia. The suburb is located east of the Bendigo city centre along the McIvor Highway. At the 2016 census, Junortoun had a population of approximately 3,200.
History.
The original inhabitants of Junortoun were the Dja Dja Warrung people who lived throughout the Loddon Valley for thousands of years prior to European settlement. It was originally established as “Homebush”, centred around the "Homebush" Estate. Homebush was an estate of some 2,000 acres extending along the valley of Splitters Creek, and was also the receiving Post Office for the district up until the early 1970s.
The name was changed to Junortoun around 1912 to avoid confusion with Homebush, New South Wales. The owner of "Homebush" estate proposed the name "Junor" after his wife's maiden name and this was submitted to the authorities. However, this name was rejected on the grounds that it was too close to "Junee" in New South Wales. At a subsequent meeting the suffix "toun" was added to "Junor" and again submitted and this was found to be acceptable.
Junortoun is one of the many localities in the region that can trip-up and tongue-tie visitors with its pronunciation. Junortoun is in fact pronounced as "joo-ner-t'n". 
Junortoun is surrounded by the Bendigo suburbs of East Bendigo, Strathdale, Kennington, Strathfieldsaye and the outer-rural suburbs of Longlea and Wellsford.
Today, Junortoun is a growing residential suburb, comprising a mix of low, medium and high-density residential land.
Community facilities.
Schools.
Junortoun includes the Coolock campus of Catholic secondary school Catherine McAuley College. The campus was originally established in 1954 by the Vincentian Fathers. In 1977 governance changed to the Marist Brothers, and in 1983 governance changed to a partnership between the Marist Brothers and the Sisters of Mercy. In January 2013, the campus became the sole governance of the Sisters of Mercy and in 2018, the school was renamed from Catholic College Bendigo (CCB), signifying the end to the Sisters of Mercy and the Marist Brothers governance partnership formed in 1983 and became known as Catherine McAuley College.
Sporting facilities.
Lords Raceway is home to the Bendigo Harness Racing Club and greyhound racing organised by the Bendigo Greyhound Racing Association.
Other facilities.
Junortoun has a CFA station, a Baptist Church, pub and an army training base.
The O'Keefe Rail Trail runs through the suburb and is a sandy gravel trail that runs along a former branch line on the Melbourne-Sydney rail line. The disused railway track has been converted into a multi-use path, typically used for walking and cycling.

Anthony D. Holmes

Anthony David Holmes AO (b. 1945) is a plastic and reconstructive surgeon who trained in both Australia and the United States, and is qualified in both countries. His primary interest is facial reconstruction and he has developed several new procedures. His most high-profile surgery was in 2009 when he worked with a large team of experts to separate the Bangladeshi conjoined twins Trishna and Krishna. In 1990 he created the Children's Craniofacial Foundation of Australia which has subsequently been renamed The Jigsaw Foundation.
Early years.
In 1969, Holmes graduated from Melbourne University MBBS with honours in Biology, Physiology, Medical Psychology, and Surgery. He followed this with General Surgery training from 1970 to 1974, then Plastic Surgery training from 1975 to 1978 at Royal Melbourne Hospital. He held positions as Plastic Surgery Resident from 1971 and Senior Plastic Surgery Registrar from 1975 at the same hospital. He became a Fellow of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in 1978. Holmes undertook a Plastic Surgery Residency at Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA from 1976 to 1978. He was certified as a Fellow in Plastic Surgery, Harvard Medical School in 1978 and as a Diplomate of the American Board of Plastic Surgery in 1982.
Craniofacial speciality.
Since 1978 Holmes has been Consultant Plastic Surgeon at Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne where he set up The Melbourne Craniofacial Unit in 1979. He was head of Cleft and Craniofacial Surgery until 2009 and the Director of the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery from 1990 to 2003 when he became Senior Plastic Surgeon. During his career Holmes has been Consultant Plastic Surgeon for a number of hospitals, often concurrently: 1979 to Present Victorian Plastic Surgery Unit, 1979 to 1989 Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, 1979 to 1980 Peter MacCallum Hospital, Melbourne, 1980 to Present, Epworth Hospital and Consultant Paediatric Plastic Surgeon at Royal Women's Hospital, Melbourne 1993 to Present.
Holmes has trained over thirty Craniofacial Fellows, the majority of whom have become Heads of Departments in Australia and overseas.
He was a young surgeon working in New Guinea when he developed his passion.
Holmes has performed life-changing operations on many children during his career. He has developed and improved new procedures to solve many major and difficult craniofacial reconstructive problems. Holmes and colleagues at The Royal Children's Hospital have developed the "Melbourne Procedure" to normalise the skulls of children with severely deformed heads and has successfully treated more than thirty children. The surgery is not just cosmetic, as restriction on the brain can cause developmental delays. He describes the procedure as “nothing more than advanced carpentry”. This the procedure was used to correct a condition known as scaphocephaly for one-year-old Isaac Jones.
In 2018, at 72, Holmes was still working 60 hours a week; raising funds for the Jigsaw Foundation and operating at the Royal Children's Hospital.
Academic positions.
Since 1981 Holmes has been Associate, Department of Paediatrics at the University of Melbourne. He was awarded the McIndoe Lectureship of the British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons, London in 2010. He was the inaugural Harvard Plastic Surgery Resident's Visiting Professor in 2012. He has 57 articles listed in PubMed.
Professional societies.
Holmes is a member of numerous professional associations and societies:
Jigsaw Foundation.
Holmes is the Founder and Board Member of Children's Craniofacial Foundation of Australia which was renamed The Jigsaw Foundation. The foundation, established in 1990, consists of nine voluntary directors and is a donor funded, not-for-profit organisation which promotes research and education in paediatric craniofacial surgery. While service and community organisations are able to provide travel and accommodation, the foundation supports the Department of Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Melbourne by providing advanced equipment. The foundation also supports surgeons from both Australia and overseas while they train in paediatric craniofacial surgery in the belief that this is the best way to spread knowledge and skills. Additionally the foundation funds the Jigsaw Foundation Chair of Paediatric Plastic and Maxillofacial Surgery at Melbourne University which supports a Professor and several PhD students to carry out further research in paediatric craniofacial surgery.
Significant cases.
Holmes was part of a large team involved in the 27 hour surgery to separate the Bangladeshi conjoin twins, Trishna and Krishna who were joined at the skull. Although they were given only a 25 per cent chance of both surviving the separation surgery without brain damage, in 2010 at 7 years old, they were "not only surviving but thriving."
Six year old, Kim Thoa Nguyen was brought from Vietnam by Rotary Overseas Medical Aid for Children (ROMAC). In 2001, Holmes and Andrew Heggie, a maxilo-facial surgeon, a dental surgeon who worked on her upper jawbone, spent 8 months correcting severe cranio-facial deformities.
Eman Tabaza first came to Australia from Gaza in 2004 when she was eight. Holmes led an eight-hour operation at the Royal Children's Hospital which removed the tumour and rebuilt Eman's face. She returned to Melbourne at 16 for further facial surgery and Professor Tony Penington also performed spinal surgery related to the same birth defect.
ROMAC also brought Asi from Papua New Guinea so that Holmes and Neurosurgeon Mr Patrick Lo were able to correct a rare cranio-facial abnormality called an encephalocele. Operation Rainbow and the Australian Filipino Guidance Association raised funds for eight year old Ronald Aguliar to travel to Australia so that surgeons including Holmes could rebuild his severely deformed face. He was able to return home feeling and acting like a normal child.
Awards.
In 2004 Holmes received the Elizabeth Turner Medal which acknowledges “excellence in clinical care provided by a member of the Senior Medical/Dental Staff of the RCH over an extended period of time. This medal is awarded primarily on the basis of the individual’s contribution to the clinical care of their patients."
Holmes was awarded the Royal Children's Hospital Chairman's Medal in 2008 for "a member of staff and recognises exemplary achievement by an individual in her or his chosen field. It commemorates an outstanding contribution to the work and reputation of the RCH, and a significant impact by the individual on the hospital’s vision to be a great children's hospital, leading the way."
In January 2018 Holmes became an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for "distinguished service to medicine, particularly to reconstructive and craniofacial surgery, as a leader, clinician and educator, and to professional medical associations".

Biography.
Ellen Sulzberger Straus was born to a Jewish family Manhattan in 1925, the daughter of Louise Mayer Blumenthal and David Hays Sulzberger. Her uncle was "The New York Times" publisher Arthur Hays Sulzberger and her grandfather was the German-born merchant Cyrus Leopold Sulzberger. She had two sisters: Jean Sulzberger and Ann Sulzberger Sand. In 1945, she graduated with a B.A. from Smith College.

In 1963, she founded the United States' first telephone help line, a non-profit entitled "Call for Action", whose purpose was to assisting people who had problems with government officials, businesses, and landlords. She later took the endeavor national with its headquarters in Washington, D.C.; the help line served as the example for similar efforts nationwide. In 1983, she conducted an exclusive interview with Jean Harris, the murderer of "Scarsdale Diet" doctor Herman Tarnower which she developed into a radio series. She and her husband owned the Manhattan-based radio station WMCA (AM) which her husband inherited in 1961; they sold the station in 1986.

Raid on Charlottetown (1775)

The Raid on Charlottetown took place on 17-18 November 1775 as part of the Washington's first naval expedition during the American Revolutionary War. The raid involved two American privateers of the Marblehead Regiment attacking and pillaging Charlottetown. As a result of the expedition, the Governor of Nova Scotia Francis Legge declared martial law throughout the colony. The raid resulted in a diplomatic crisis for George Washington when the privateers overstepped their orders and took prisoner the Acting Governor, the Naval Commander and the Surveyor General of the colony.
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal.
In retaliation for the British Burning of Falmouth, in October 1775, General Washington order the first American naval expedition. Washington borrowed two vessels from John Glover's Marblehead Regiment. Glover recruited his son-in-law Captain Nicholson Broughton in the "Hancock" (not the Lynch ) and Captain John Selman (privateer) in the . They were ordered to intercept two brigs as they arrived in the St. Lawrence River from England. But the two schooners instead sought easier quarry off Cape Canso where five prizes of dubious legality were taken. The American Privateers heard that the British were recruiting military at St. John's Island and decided to attack.
Washington sent Selman with Nicholson Broughton to lead an expedition off Nova Scotia to interrupt two British ships full of armaments bound for Quebec. Broughton commanded the USS Hancock, joined by Captain Selman in the Franklin. Selman and Broughton gathered intelligence at Canso, Nova Scotia that the two ships en route to Quebec had already gone to Quebec the month earlier. Broughton and Selman wrote Washington that "we are however something comforted in that no Vessel passes this season to Boston, Halifax or to any part of America from Quebec but must pass within gun Shot of us."
Broughton and Selman captured seven British vessels around Canso. On 29 October Broughton captured the schooners Prince William (Capt. William Standley Cr) and Mary (Capt. Thomas Russell). Two days later, Selam and Broughton wrote to Washington, that he captured the sloop Phoebe commanded by Captain James Hawkins. The sloop was owned by Boston loyalist Enoch Rust. Broughton indicated that Rust was “contrary … to the Association of the united American Colonies.” He also described Loyalist Boston as a “Den of Mischievous Violators of the rights of Humanity.” Five days later, on 5 November, Broughton took the sloop Warren owned by Thomas Cochrane of Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Warren was commanded by Captain John Denny, who Broughton described as not being in “a very favorable light respecting their attachment to American Liberties.”
The Raid.
Selman and Broughton gathered intelligence that the Governor of St. John Island was recruiting for the war efforts against the Americans. Selman wrote the Vice-President of the United States that they were, “supposing we should do essential service by breaking up a nest of [loyalist] recruits.” As a result, Broughton headed for Charlottetown.
On 17 November, both captains landed with two parties of six men each. They took prisoners for possible exchange for Patriot Americans prisoner taken at Quebec. There were two prisoners: the Acting Governor Phillips Callbeck and the Surveyor General Thomas Wright.
They ransacked Callbeck's home, emptied his stores and took the province silver Seal weight 59 ounces and Governor Patterson's Commission. They also broke into and plundered Governor Patterson's House.
Selman and Broughton also searched unsuccessfully for the wives of Callbeck and the senior naval commander of the colony Captain David Higgins, both of whom were daughters of prominent Boston loyalists. Callbeck's wife was the daughter of Nathaniel Coffin Jr., who a few months earlier had ordered the felling of the Liberty Tree on the Boston Common. Higgins wife was the daughter of Job Princes of Boston.
Before the privateers left, they spiked the cannons at the fort.
Aftermath.
The privateers took more prisoners at Canso: the senior naval commander of the colony Captain David Higgins was captured in his schooner Lively on Nov. 23 in the Gut of Canso. On board were the Governor's priest Rev. Theophilus Desbrisay and Council member John Russell Spence, who were briefly held but shortly released. Higgins and the two others from Charlottetown were taken hostage to Winter Harbour in present-day Maine and then marched them to their headquarters in Cambridge. (En route they were involved in the Raid on Yarmouth, Nova Scotia (1775).) 
Upon the privateers returned, Washington censored them for taking government officials prisoner without permission and sent the prisoners free. Washington wanted colonies to join the rebellion freely rather than conquering them. While George Washington censored Selman and Broughton, John Adams (who was on the committee to establish the navy) supported the privateers stating that they may “deserve censure for going counter to [their] orders, but I think in justice to ourselves we ought to seize every [Loyalist] officer in the service of Government wherever they may be found." When Selman was retired years later, the Vice President of the United States Elbridge Gerry favourably re-evaluated his contribution to the war effort and signed his letter, "with much esteem and respect, E. Gerry."
Callback returned and became the Commander for the St. John Volunteers in the Revolutionary War, investing heavily in the island's defences. (The St. John Volunteers were later named Fanning's Corps of Island Saint John's Volunteers and then, in 1799, the Prince Edward Island Fencibles.) 
The privateers continued to attack throughout the war and Loyalists were re-routed away from the Island to settle at Louisbourg. In August 1777, 2 privateers invaded Saint Peters and killed livestock.
The privateers pillaged the property of Wellwood Waugh and he was forced to move from Charlottetown to Pictou, Nova Scotia, the following year. (In 1777, Waugh was himself implicated in an American privateer raid on Pictou and was forced to move to Tatamagouche, Nova Scotia. He became a prominent inhabitant and Waugh River is named after him.) 
Major Timothy Hierlihy was ordered to be the commander of the defence of Prince Edward Island. (In 1778, Timothy defended the Spanish River coal mines in Cape Breton from American privateers — recapturing two vessels, retrieving loyalist property, killing one of the privateers and sending other prisoners to Halifax. He later established Antigonish, Nova Scotia).

2019 Japanese House of Councillors election

House of Councillors elections were held in Japan on 21 July 2019 to elect 124 of the 245 members of the House of Councillors, the upper house of the then 710-member bicameral National Diet, for a term of six years.
74 members were elected by single non-transferable vote (SNTV)/First-past-the-post (FPTP) voting in 45 multi- and single-member prefectural electoral districts. The nationwide district elected 50 members by D'Hondt proportional representation with optionally open lists, the previous most open list system was modified in 2018 to give parties the option to prioritize certain candidates over the voters' preferences in the proportional election.
The election saw Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ruling coalition lose the two-thirds majority needed to enact constitutional reform. The Liberal Democratic Party also lost its majority in the House of Councillors, but the LDP maintained control of the House of Councillors with its junior coalition partner Komeito.
Background.
The term of members elected in the 2013 regular election (including those elected in subsequent by-elections or as runners-up) was to end on 28 July 2019. Under the "Public Offices Election Act" "(kōshoku-senkyo-hō)", the regular election must be held within 30 days before that date, or under certain conditions if the Diet is in session or scheduled to open at that time, between 24 and 30 days after the closure of the session and thus potentially somewhat after the actual end of term.
Going into the election, the Liberal Democratic Party and its coalition partner Komeito controlled a two-thirds super-majority of seats in the House of Representatives but did not control a similar super-majority of seats in the House of Councillors, necessary to initiate amendments of the Constitution of Japan.
Pre-election composition.
"(as of 15 March 2018)"
In the class of members facing re-election, the ruling coalition of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Kōmeitō and Party for Japanese Kokoro (PJK) had a combined 81 of 121 seats (as of March 2018). The governing coalition would have to lose 30 seats or more to forfeit its overall majority in the House of Councillors and face a technically divided Diet. However, as independents and minor opposition groups might be willing to support the government on a regular basis without inclusion in the cabinet, the losses required to face an actual divided Diet may have been much higher. If the Diet is divided after the election, the coalition's two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives can still override the House of Councillors and pass legislation, but certain Diet decisions, notably the approval of certain nominations by the cabinet such as public safety commission members or Bank of Japan governor, would require the cooperation of at least part of the opposition or an expansion of the ruling coalition.
Among the members facing re-election were House of Councillors President Chuichi Date (LDP, Hokkaido), Kōmeitō leader Natsuo Yamaguchi (K, Tokyo) and Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Hiroshige Seko (LDP, Wakayama at-large district).
District reapportionment.
The following districts saw a change in their representation within the House at this election. One set of reforms were introduced in 2012 and first took effect at the 2013 election. The districts below are affected by the 2015 reforms, which started to take effect in the 2016 election.
In May 2018, the government announced that they are planning to introduce a revision into the Public Offices Election Law before the 2019 election. The proposed changes increased the number seats in the House by 6, 2 seats in the Saitama at-large district and 4 in the national PR block. As Saitama currently has the highest voters-to-councillor ratio, the increase would reduce its ratio gap with the least populous district (below the constitutional 3 to 1 limit). Meanwhile the seat increase in the PR block is aimed to address the absence of representation of prefectures in the merged-prefecture districts (namely Tottori-Shimane and Tokushima-Kōchi) and popular discontent in those prefectures. The plan also introduced a ranking system for the PR lists. This essentially changed it from a most open list system into a less open list system, mirroring the one used in the House of Representatives elections. To reduce the chance of the non-representation of a prefecture, candidates from prefectures not running in the merged districts were to be prioritised on the list.
Under the plan, the new Saitama seat and two new PR seats were contested in 2019, while the other three would be contested in 2022.

Zehra Doğan

Zehra Doğan (born 14 April 1989) is a Kurdish artist and journalist and author from Diyarbakır, Turkey. In 2017, she was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months and 22 days in prison for "terrorist propaganda" because of her news coverage, social media posts, and sharing a painting of hers on social media. Her painting depicts the destruction of the Nusaybin, town in southeastern Turkey, after the clashes between state security forces and Kurdish insurgents. After she finished her sentence, she was released from imprisonment from Tarsus Prison on 24 February 2019.
Career.
She was a founder and the editor of Jinha, a feminist Kurdish news agency with an all-female staff. Jinha was closed on 29 October 2016 by Turkish authorities, as one of over 100 media outlets shut down since the failed coup d'état in July 2016. In February 2016, Doğan moved to and began reporting from Nusaybin.
Arrest and imprisonment.
On 21 July 2016, she was detained at a café in Nusaybin and then incarcerated on 23 July in Mardin prison. Her release pending trial was ordered on the 9 December of the same year. On 2 March 2017, she was acquitted of the charge of "belonging to an illegal organisation", but was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months and 22 days in jail for her news reporting and posting a painting to social media. She appealed the sentence but it was confirmed and she was arrested on 12 July 2017.
"I was given two years and 10 months [jail time] only because I painted Turkish flags on destroyed buildings. However, they (Turkish government) caused this. I only painted it," Doğan wrote on Twitter following the sentencing.
In prison, she and other women created the newspaper Özgür Gündem Zindan (Free Agenda Dungeon), whose name is a wordplay on Özgür Gündem (Free Agenda), an Istanbul-based publication that catered to Kurdish audiences. Doğan was released from prison in February 2019.
International reaction to the imprisonment.
In November 2017, Chinese dissident artist Ai WeiWei published a letter he wrote in solidarity with Doğan's case, drawing parallels between Chinese and Turkish repression of artistic expression. Doğan answers the artist from prison: "Art is the best instrument for the struggle". On 16 March 2018, England-based graffiti artist, Banksy unveiled a mural in New York, measuring 70 feet long, showing black tally marks for the days of Doğan's imprisonment, with one set becoming bars behind which Doğan's face looks out from jail. Speaking to The New York Times, Banksy said, "I really feel for her... I’ve painted things much more worthy of a custodial sentence."
In 2019, Creative Nomads, an Italian production, will release a documentary film featuring three women: "Terrorist. Zehra and the others". The novelist Aslı Erdoğan, and the forensic doctor and human rights defender Şebnem Korur Fincancı are interviewed, Doğan participates by correspondence from the prison, and she is represented by animated sequences with the voice of the actress Kasia Smoutniak. The documentary is directed by Marica Casalinuovo, Francesca Nava, Vichie Chinaglia, Marella Bombini.

International Mini Meet

The International Mini Meet or International Mini Meeting is a campaign event for Mini owners and drivers which started in Germany in 1978. The Meet is organised by a collection of Mini clubs. Its goal is to bring together Mini enthusiasts from around the world.
The event caters to the interests of Mini drivers, as well as those looking to purchase the car. Besides the purely automotive aspect of the meet, participants can also take part in treasure hunts, slalom races, and other Mini-themed events.
Schedule.
The Meet starts on a Friday afternoon. An official welcome gathering occurs that evening, which includes a presentation of all participating clubs.
On Saturday, the presidents' meeting takes place. During this meeting, individual clubs can make a presentation in hopes of winning the right to host a future event. Saturday evening usually brings a themed party.
On Sunday, a form of cavalcade, featuring various Minis, is held. On Sunday evening, the event is closed by a formal handover of "the event key" to the club organizing it the year after.
Location.
Every year the event takes place in a different country, usually around the Whitsun weekend. The club's rules provide also that every 5 years since 1989 (counting from 1959), the event be celebrated in England, the birthplace of the Mini car. These conventions usually take place in August.

High Maintenance (Saweetie EP)

High Maintenance is the debut extended play (EP) by American rapper Saweetie. It was released digitally on March 16, 2018, by Warner Records and Artistry Worldwide. It is composed of nine tracks, with "Icy Grl" having been released as a single on October 2, 2017. The EP debuted at number 32 on the "Billboard" R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Album Sales chart.
Background.
After graduating, Saweetie decided to pursue a rap career. She began posting short raps on her Instagram account in 2016. One video featured her rapping over the beat from Khia's classic "My Neck, My Back (Lick It)", which would eventually turn into "Icy Grl". She first released the song on her SoundCloud in the summer of 2017 and later released a music video for it in October of the same year. The visual would go viral online. To follow that up, Saweetie released in that same month a freestyle rap called "High Maintenance" accompanied by a short clip of herself rapping a verse to the song, all while in her kitchen. It would go viral on Instagram and Twitter as well. In February 2018, she signed to Warner Records and her manager Max Gousse's record label Artistry Worldwide, subsequently releasing the EP "High Maintenance" in March 2018.
Composition and concept.
The songs "B.A.N." and "23" speak about relationships, and are speculated to be about her ex-boyfriends Justin Combs, who is P. Diddy's eldest son, and Keith Powers, whom she dated for up to four years.
With "high maintenance", Saweetie reportedly doesn't mean only designer things. "The relationships I have with people are very high maintenance, meaning I nurture them," she says. "Essentially, I care for them. I also pray a lot, work out, and eat well so all aspects of my life are high maintenance... Since it's an introductory to the game, I feel like it's appropriate way to brand myself."

The Château du Bousquet is a castle in the village of Le Bousquet, part of the "commune" of Montpeyroux in the Aveyron "département" of France. The castle is privately owned, but open to the public after 14:30 except on Tuesdays.
Description.
The castle, which belonged for four centuries to the Roquefeuil-Blanquefort family, comprises six towers (two hexagonal in the middle of the two front and rear facades, four rounds at each corner). The central tower of the south facade, which contains the staircase is pierced on the ground floor of a radiating Gothic door. The typically feudal and defensive character of the castle is somewhat mitigated by the existence of later windows on the three floors. The defensive system which surrounded it (enclosure, ditch, fortifications) disappeared, replaced by two wings in the 17th century. Inside, the ground floor has kept its kitchen intact, with the mesh stage where the musicians were based. The chapel retains a decoration painted by Debert in 1709.

Ida Winckler

Ida Anna Winkler (1907–1995) was a Danish painter and textile artist. In 1930, she joined the newly established "Haandarbejdets Fremme" (Danish Handcraft Guild), where over the next 65 years she created hundreds of mainly cross-stitch patterns. They have been widely used not only in Denmark, but also in Germany, the United States and Japan. She also contributed to a number of embroidery guides, some in English, published from the 1950s to the 1970s.
Early life and education.
Born on 20 May 1907 in the Copenhagen district of Frederiksberg, Ida Anna Winckler was the daughter of Peter Johan Winckler (1862–1953), a sea captain, and Anna Elise Bornholm (1869–1907). Her artistic talents were developed at the Tegne- og Kunstindustriskolen for Kvinder (Arts and Crafts School for Women) under Margrete Drejer and Gunnar Biilmann Petersen. Drejer introduced her to both Danish and foreign styles of sewing and embroidery, including complex techniques such as goldwork. On receiving her diploma in 1928, Winckler remained at the school as a teacher, developing embroidery patterns, especially for whitework, for use as educational aids in high schools.
Career.
In 1930, Winckler gained employment at the newly established Danish Handcraft Guild where for the next 65 years she created hundreds of embroidery patterns which were widely used both in Denmark and in countries such as Germany, the United States and Japan. They were intended principally for decorating the home, consisting of wall panels, table cloths and Christmas items, but they also covered handbags finely embroidered in silks. Her early work represented patterns for reproducing traditional work such as 17th-century silk-embroidered canvas and 19th-century rural whitework. Later, much of her work was more freely designed, as she began to create simpler patterns, especially for cross stitch which became popular after the Second World War. Here Winckler became a major contributor, creating artistically presented patterns, often with intricate detail. Her cross-stitch patterns for houses are of particular note, as are her representations of the coats of arms of Danish and Swedish cities.
Her patterns were based on watercolour paintings or colour photographs of the scenes or objects she intended to reproduce. She had a gift for selecting appropriately coloured threads and for emphasizing the most important features. She also managed to give her work a modern look. Her many published works testify to her diligent approach, overcoming the limitations of the availability of only about 80 available colours for cross stitch. Together with Gerda Bengtsson, she developed a colour-identification system, indicating on a black-and-white pattern which colours should be used for the different sections.
From the 1970s, Winckler collaborated with Anna Sofie Boesen Dreijer in developing sewing patterns for embroidering traditional folk costumes for "Foreningen til Folkedansens Fremme", a folk dance association.
Ida Winckler died on 4 April 1995 in Copenhagen.
Publications.
Ida Winckler has contributed to a number of sewing guides in Danish and other languages. The following are in English:

It was introduced in January 2015, with Cambridge English Scale scores replacing the standardised score and candidate profile used for exams taken pre-2015. The scale aims to provide exam users with more detailed information about their exam performance than was previously available. 
Each of the qualifications is also aligned with a level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). Cambridge English Qualifications are set and administered by Cambridge Assessment English (previously known as Cambridge English Language Assessment and University of Cambridge ESOL examination).
History.
Cambridge Assessment English exams, starting with C2 Proficiency in 1913, B2 First in 1939, and B1 Preliminary in 1980, gave learners and teachers different curriculum and examination levels. By the early 1990s, with the addition of A2 Key and C1 Advanced, Cambridge English exams provided a range of different curriculum and examination levels.
The concept of a framework of reference levels for English language learning, teaching and assessment, laid the foundations for the development of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR).
During the mid-1990s, Cambridge Assessment English and other founding members of the newly formed Association of Language Testers in Europe (ALTE) then worked to relate different language qualifications within a shared framework of reference. The ALTE Framework was developed simultaneously alongside the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR) published in draft form in 1997. Both frameworks share a common conceptual origin, similar aims and comparable scales of empirically developed descriptors.
The qualifications.
Each of the Cambridge English Qualifications focuses on a level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR).
There are Cambridge English Qualifications for schools, general and higher education, and business.
Research basis.
Assessment at different levels gives learners clear goals to work towards during language learning, with each level corresponding to a meaningful improvement in language competency.
The study of how learners are motivated was pioneered in the post-war years by John William Atkinson at the University of Michigan. In his book "Motivation and Achievement", Atkinson argued that motivation is increased when there is an attainable goal in an activity that is highly valued.
John Hattie and Helen Timperley of the University of Auckland argue that assessment feedback is most effective when it relates to specific tasks, and focuses on how to improve. They propose that there are three important questions for learners: 
Cambridge English Qualifications aim to provide information about the learners’ level in each individual language skill (reading, writing, speaking and listening), to enable learners to take action on problem areas and monitor their own progress. This is also designed to allow students to be actively involved in their learning, and gain self-confidence as they move to the next level.

Caundle Brook

Caundle Brook is a tributary of the River Lydden that flows through Blackmore Vale in Dorset, England.
Its headwaters rise at the foot of Dogbury Hill near Cosmore, the brook then flows in a northerly direction past the villages of Middlemarsh and Tiley until it collects The Cam and a second tributary that drains Caundle Marsh. Here it turns east, and is then crossed by Cornford Bridge and then the A3030 near Bishop's Caundle, it continues past Rowden Mill south of Stourton Caundle before being crossed by the A357 at Warr Bridge beyond which it joins the Lydden near Lydlinch.

Ottos mops

ottos mops [Eng: Otto's pug] is a poem by, Austrian poet Ernst Jandl. It is thought to have been written on the 20th of November, 1963, and was first published in 1970 in Jandl's volume "Der künstliche Baum "[Eng: the artificial tree]. The poem is made up of simple sentences of two to four words that contain exclusively the vowel "o". It tells the story of a short episode in the life of a dog and its owner: after Otto sends his badly behaved pug away, he begins to miss it and calls it back. The reaction of the returning pug is, however, not quite what is expected: it vomits.
"Ottos mops" is one of Jandl's most famous humorous poems. The author himself labelled it a 'Sprechgedicht': a poem that creates its particular effect best when read aloud. It is frequently used in German schools as an example of concrete poetry, and has inspired several imitations by other poets, and by children.
Content and style.
Ernst Jandl's ottos mops and Elizabeth MacKiernan's Lulu's Pooch
link to full text
"ottos mops "is made up of 14 lines divided into three stanzas. At the beginning, a badly behaved pug is sent away by his owner, Otto.&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
"ottos mops trotzt
otto: fort mops fort
ottos mops hopst fort"
[otto's pug defies him
otto: away pug away
otto's pug hops away]
&lt;/poem&gt;Otto comments on the fact that the pug follows his command with the word "soso". Then he completes every-day activities, such as fetching coke and fruit. After a while, he listens for the pug, calls it, and hopes that it returns. The pug knocks, and is greeted joyfully by Otto, but its reaction is unexpected:&lt;poem style="margin-left:2em;"&gt;
"ottos mops kommt
ottos mops kotzt
otto: ogottogott"
[otto's pug comes
otto's pug pukes
otto: ohgodohgod]
&lt;/poem&gt;Because the sound of the poem is so important, a literal translation such as that above does not do it justice. Translations of "ottos mops" therefore tend to carry the basic structure of the poem into other languages, conveying Jandl's word play freely. As such, Elizabeth MacKiernan translated "ottos mops" for the US-American Jandl poetry collection "Reft and Light" as "Lulu's Pooch." In 2005, the online service "sightandsight.com" held a competition to translate "ottos mops" in honor of Jandl's 80th birthday. Scottish scholar of German Brian O. Murdoch won with his poem "fritz's bitch".
Text analysis.
The most striking feature of the poem "ottos mops "is that it is univocalic: all the words contain only the vowel "o", while consonant selection remains free. This radically restricts word choice. It does not make word choice strictly serial in the sense of generative poetics, but rather allows the composition of a text under a variety of possibilities, which tells a particular story. The poem is composed of 41 words with o-assonance, but is only built out of 15 different root words that are continually repeated. There are only two acting characters: Otto and the pug. They are assigned verbs that appear in the first person singular indicative present tense, the only exception to this being the imperative "komm" [Eng: come] with which Otto calls his pug back, and which stands out because it is repeated.The only punctuation mark used is the colon, to introduce direct speech. By not using punctuation in his works, Jandl refers to Gertrude Stein's idea that commas get in the way of the reader's activity and autonomy when their only function is to make reading easier. Equally characteristic for Jandl is that the poem is written entirely in lowercase, which has a visual function in his poetry, where capital letters are reserved for special emphasis. In German, every noun is capitalized – in contrast to English, which only uses capitals for proper nouns – so this is even more striking.
Every line of the poem begins with the anaphor "otto", or the possessive (genitive) "ottos". Even in the title, the pug follows directly, in a combination that is repeated five times in the poem, and which underlines the close relationship between the two characters. The sentences are short, sometimes elliptical, and consist of two to a maximum of four words. In their simplicity they are reminiscent of the words of a young child. The individual words are monosyllabic, with the exception of "otto" and his comments "soso" and "ogottogott", which stand out because they are polysyllabic and because they are reduplicated. The pug is the grammatical subject of five sentences. The first and last stanzas of the poem show the pug's actions, which are commented on by Otto, who himself first becomes the agent in the middle of the stanza. Because of this, the first and last stanzas are syntactically analogous, but they contrast semantically: the growing distance between Otto and his pug in the first four lines is juxtaposed with the parallel return of the dog at the end. The line "ottos mops kotzt" rhymes with the first line "ottos mops trotzt", linking the beginning and the end of the poem and making the end the consequence of the beginning.
Interpretation.
Although "ottos mops" is frequently mentioned in poetry studies, there have been relatively few studies which focus exclusively on "ottos mops".
Order and revolt.
For the German scholar Andreas Brandtner, the title already shows the relationship between Otto and the pug: the possessive genitive assigns and subordinates the pug to Otto. In addition, the pug is only ever referred to by its breed, which, being a traditional domestic dog, further suggests that Otto is the pug's master. This situation is disrupted by the rebelliousness of the defiant pug, without any explanation of what exactly the pug is rebelling against. After Otto has sent the pug away, the conflict subsides for a while, while Otto is distracted by other activities. However, it is not long before he regrets sending the pug away. He calls to the pug, and his hope that it will return reveals their inner bond. Otto's listening tension is answered by the pug knocking in the third stanza. For a moment, it seems as though the conflict will be resolved, due to the pug's obedience. But the pug vomits, which breaks this accord and refers back to the pug's original defiance: in an instinctive act, the dog continues its attitude of defiance. Otto's rather indifferent or even threatening "soso" gives way to an appalled "ogottogott", an exclamation which contains the palindrome "otto".
Brandtner sees two levels at the core of the poem: the communication between human and animal, between master and hound, whose effectiveness is questioned; and the power relationship of the character constellation and its reference to real social-historic processes. According to Brandtner, this places "ottos mops" within the tradition of Jandl's other poetry, which, in the broadest sense, can always be understood as critical of society and language. At the same time, a democratic perspective is also inherent in "ottos mops": the simple style encourages the reader to develop their own language games, and opens up participation in the production of poetry to the reader, in accordance with the avant-garde belief that art should play a role in everyday life.
Humor and poetry.
The German scholar Anne Uhrmacher, who wrote a dissertation on Jandl's poetry, feels that what differentiates "ottos mops" from the many adaptions that came as a consequence of its growing popularity is the form of humor that is different from the wit and irony of many attempts in the same style. She quotes Ludwig Reiners: "Wit laughs, humor smiles. Wit is ingenious, humor is affectionate. Wit sparkles, humor is radiant." In this sense, according to Uhrmacher, Jandl's humor, which is expressed in Otto's longing for the pug as well as in the comfort of the little world described, is far more than just witty word play.
Jandl himself differentiated the cheerful tone of poems such as" ottos mops" from the "grim" and "grotesque" humor of other texts. These, he argued, are poems "where people are right to laugh and where you don’t notice any controversial intentions."
Dieter Burdorf, another German scholar, sees a different form of humor in "ottos mops". The poem reminds him of the slapstick humor of early silent films or of comic strips. Thus the comedy arises here not from the trivial content, but rather from the sound structure. The "o" sound is an exclamation of astonishment. The facial expression that the performer adopts, with rounded mouth for the "o", invites cabaret-like exaggeration in the opening and closing of the lips, and this itself was adopted by Jandl himself in the performance of the poem. Hans Mayer also discusses Jandl's elocution: "For children, Ernst Jandl’s concrete poetry was always immediately evident. [...] When Jandl himself recites it, children imitate him." Volker Hage feels that nobody could "shout out, whisper, celebrate, stutter, twist, chop up, spit out or caress their own lines" like Jandl. For him, "ottos mops" sounds as though it is structured like a nursery rhyme.
In her commentary on "ottos" mops, Jandl's life companion Friederike Mayröcker referred to "the author’s linguistic analysis of a vowel: he sings the high praises of O, of O-animal, of O-God, ohgodohgod, of the dog owner Otto, of the pug, who found his way back home, and we all laugh and cry". She sees the reader as being affected by a naive sympathy for both the owner of the pug and the pug itself: they are brought back to their early childhood experiences with animals. In the lines of the poem, a transition is accomplished "that succeeds afresh every time, namely from love of the vowel, to the reality of the image; from belief in the O for the revelation of poetry".
Position in Jandl's works.
"Ottos mops" was not Jandl's first attempt at writing poems which used only one vowel. In August 1963 he wrote "das große e" [Eng: the great e], a cycle of nine poems that are consistently based around the vowel "e", and in 1963/4 he penned a poem dominated by the vowel "a", "mal franz mal anna (drama") [Eng: now franz, now anna (drama)]. Other poems by Jandl are built on the frequent use of a particular consonant, for example the poem "etude in f," published in June 1956.
In the collection "der künstliche baum", Jandl sorted his poems according to type, and in doing so differentiated between visual poems and sound poems. "Ottos mops" was placed in the section of "lese- und sprechgedichte" [Eng: read and spoken poetry]. In 1957, Jandl said the following of this form of poetry: "The "sprechgedicht "only becomes effective when it is read aloud. The length and intensity of the sounds are fixed in the way they are written. Tension arises through the sequences of short and long sounds [...], the hardening of the words through the lack of vowels [...], the dismantling of the word and the adding together of its elements to create new expressive groups of sound [...], varied repetition of words with the thematically justified addition of new words, up to the explosive ending."
In terms of subject matter, dogs play a big role in Jandl's poetry. Jörg Drews counted 42 poems that mention dogs, which makes up 3% of Jandl's total production.
Reception.
The poetry collection "der künstliche baum "[Eng: the artificial tree]"," in which "ottos mops" was first published, proved to be an immediate sales success. Initially 4,000 books were printed, which rose to 10,000 copies in a further two printings within the first year alone. In the mid-1970s, Jandl himself counted the volume as one of his three standard works. The poem "ottos mops" has also been published in collections of Jandl's poems and in anthologies. It has been incorporated into poetry books for children and young people, adapted into a picture book, published multiple times as an audio and music recording, and it is also the title of a German-language computer game, subtitled "In search of Jandl", which leads the player through Ernst Jandl's poetry. "Ottos mops" has often been performed by others as well as Jandl himself, such as Harry Rowohlt. In short, "ottos mops" became one of Jandl's most famous humorous poems. Robert Gernhardt called it "the second most popular poem of the German tongue [...] after Goethe’s "Wanderer's Nightsong".

Sun Dogs (2017 film)

Sun Dogs is a 2017 comedy-drama film written by Raoul McFarland and starring Michael Angarano, Melissa Benoist, Xzibit, Allison Janney, and Ed O'Neill. The film marks the feature film directorial debut of actress Jennifer Morrison, who also plays a supporting role in the film. The film premiered at the LA Film Festival in June 2017 and was released on Netflix on April 6, 2018.
Plot.
Ned Chipley (Angarano) has learning difficulties, living with his mother Rose (Janney) and his stepfather Bob Garrity (O'Neill). Ned's birthday is on September 11, so tries to enlist in the Marines every year. Rejected, he cancels his birthday dinner and goes to work at the casino. Bob can't work, being in a lawsuit against his truck-driving company for his back injuries. Rose, is frustrated, but stays strong for Ned.
In Ned's latest attempt to enlist, Staff Sergeant Jenkins (Xzibit) tells Ned about a fictitious unit known as "Sun Dogs" that watch over Al Qaeda cells in the US, knowing about Ned's desire to "save lives". Ned believes him, passing out cards, telling everyone he meets to "stay vigilant". Ned also encourages Rose to follow her dreams to become an EMT and move to NYC. Rose realizes that she can do it and has been using Ned as an excuse to stay behind, agreeing to go.
At the casino, Ned approaches Tally Petersen (Benoist), a girl constantly thrown out for speaking with customers, and tells her about his mission. Believing Ned to be a marine, she helps with the 'investigation'. They become close on stakeouts, when Ned mistakes his boss, Sameer Udday, for an Al-Qaeda agent.
After multiple stakeouts, trailing Udday everywhere he goes, filming him and his activities. Tally, talented at filmmaking, makes and edits videos they submit as "evidence" to Jenkins. They eventually sneak back into the casino. When caught, Tally is almost arrested for trespassing until Ned uses the sleeper hold on the security guard. Ned gets fired and Bob bails him out of jail. Tally is grateful to Ned and even more convinced that he is a Marine.
Ned invites Tally to Thanksgiving, but she is initially hesitant as she knows Bob. When it starts storming, Ned and Tally take shelter indoors where Tally talks about her mother. She felt invisible and wrote that if anyone said hello to her before she reached the bridge, she wouldn't kill herself (which she ended up doing). Tally declares Ned is a caring person and that he would've seen her and said Hi. Realizing that she cares about him, she accepts the dinner invite.
At Thanksgiving, Bob is clearly displeased. Rose, after learning of Tally's filmmaking talents, suggests applying to film school. Seeing that she genuinely cares for Ned, she decides not to spill the truth. Later, Bob is shocked that Rose has accepted a job as an EMT in NYC. Rose says it's time for her to find her calling, as Bob is still waiting on the lawsuit. Rose kisses Bob goodbye before leaving.
When Tally receives a transcript of the video recording of Udday's conversation after they mistakenly believe that there was going to be a second Al-Qaeda attack, she goes to Ned's, finding Bob there. Bob tells Tally the truth about Ned. In denial, she finally goes into Ned's room, sees he is not a Marine, breaking her heart. Tally lashes out at Ned for deceiving her and leaves him heartbroken.
Ned informs Jenkins that he resigns, then Bob, seeing that Ned's depression is gradually getting worse, asks Jenkins to talk to Ned. When Jenkins arrives, he apologizes for lying to him and lets him know why he never allowed him to enlist. He then leaves, telling him to find his purpose in life. Ned receives postcards from his mother and Tally, who wrote to apologize. She submitted the videos from the stakeout to a film school in San Francisco and got accepted, inspired by Ned.
Bob buys a metal detector and he and Ned search for a gold mine. They go at night so as to avoid being seen doing physical activity. Bob ultimately decides to drop the lawsuit, then gives fatherly advice to Ned. To know his limits and set realistic goals.
Ned, remembering Tally's theory that if they could prevent suicides from jumping from the Golden Gate Bridge, in 50 years it would even out 9/11. Inspired by the story of her mother's suicide, Ned makes notecards with the phrase "HELLO, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?" and, goes to the Golden Gate Bridge, handing one of them to a woman who is evidently contemplating suicide.
Release.
The film premiered LA Film Festival on June 18, 2017. The film was also featured in the 2017 Austin Film Festival, SCAD Savannah Film Festival, Los Cabos International Film Festival, Cucalorus Film Festival, and the 2018 Mammoth Film Festival.
The film won three awards at the 2018 Mammoth Film Festival, Best Actor for Michael Angarano, Best Picture, and the Grandy Jury Award. The film also won Best Narrative Feature at the 2017 SCAD Savannah Film Festival.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on five reviews. Sheri Linden from "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: "Morrison balances her affection for all the characters with droll naturalism and an assured visual style."
Renee Schonfeld from Common Sense Media gave a positive review, writing : "Jennifer Morrison's initial feature direction is a delicate movie, honest within the constraints of its fantastical premise. It focuses on relationships, compassion, and every individual's right to live a life of purpose. Sun Dogs is gentle, heartfelt, and skilled. Working with notable actors, she brings nuance and grace to what, in lesser hands, might have been stereotypes of America's struggling working class."

History of Ferencvárosi TC

Ferencvárosi Torna Club is a Hungarian professional football club based in Budapest, Hungary. They are the most decorated club in Hungary, in which they won a record of 31 national titles and 23 national cups.
1900s.
On 3 May 1899, Ferencvárosi TC was founded by citizens of the ninth district of Budapest. Ferenc Springer, a lawyer from the same district, was nominated as the first chairman of the club. The club's budget was raised by a ball held in order to celebrate the establishment of the club. The club's first pitch was built on Soroksári avenue in the ninth district.
On 3 December 1900, the football department of Ferencváros was officially founded. Two months later, in February, the first match of the Hungarian League was played between Ferencváros and Budapesti TC. Since the match was not announced to the Hungarian Football Federation, it is not considered as the club's first official match.
On 21 April 1900, the team played their first official match against Műegyetemi AFC and Ferencváros lost their first match 5–3. The first goal for the club was scored by Gáspár Borbás. The first point in the championship was gained against Műegyetemi AFC with a draw. The first victory came on 16 June 1901, when Ferencváros beat Budapesti SC 5–1.
In 1902 Ferencváros suffered the heaviest defeat in their history when they were beaten by 16–0 by Oxford United.
Ferencváros played their first match in an international competition against Budapesti Torna Club in the 1901–02 Challenge Cup on 27 April 1902. Ferencváros lost to 5–1 against their home rival in the Hungarian Final of the Challenge Cup.
Ferencváros entered the 1902–03 Challenge Cup and won the Hungarian Final against 33 FC by 1–0. In the semi-finals Ferencváros played their first official international match against Wiener Athletiksport Club and lost to 5–1 on 3 May 1903.
The 1903 season of the Hungarian League was won by Ferencváros. Two years later in 1905, Ferencváros became Hungarian champions for the second time.
The 1906–07 season was won by Ferencváros.
Ferencváros participated in the 1908–09 Challenge Cup. On 10 April 1909, Ferencváros beat VfB Leipzig 4–1. On 11 April 1909, Ferencváros drew with Budapesti TC and on 12 April 1909 Ferencváros beat MTK Budapest 2–1. As a consequence, Ferencváros finished first in the main tournament and qualified for the final of the 1908–09 Challenge Cup. On 13 June 1909, Ferencváros beat Wiener Sport-Club 2–1 at the Hohe Warte Stadium.
Ferencváros won the 1908–09 and 1909–10 seasons of the Hungarian League.

On 12 February 1911, the club's current stadium was inaugurated. The first goal in the new stadium was scored by Imre Schlosser.
In 1911 December Ferencváros went on a European tour. On 24 December 1911, the first match was won by Ferencváros 5–3 against Viktoria Hamburg in Hamburg, Kingdom of Prussia. On 25 December 1911, Ferencváros beat Bremen SC 5–0 and on 30 December 1911 Ferencváros beat Hertha BSC 4–2 in Berlin, Kingdom of Prussia.

On 10 January 1929, Ferencváros lost their last match 4–1 against English Wanderers in London, The United Kingdom.
In 1914 the First World War broke out which affected Ferencváros since many of the club's players were enlisted and many of them have never returned. The Hungarian Football Federation did not organise any competitions between the 1913–14 and the 1916–17 seasons.
1920s.
The 1920s did not start good for Ferencváros since their rivals MTK Budapest won five consecutive Hungarian League titles. Furthermore, in the 1924–25 season Ferencváros lost 14–2 to MTK Hungária FC which has been the biggest defeat in the Hungarian League. However, in 1926 Ferencváros became Hungarian champion again after 13 years. Ferencváros won the 1926–27 and the 1927–28 seasons of the Hungarian League.

Prymnesin-2

Prymnesin-2 is an organic compound that is secreted by the haptophyte "Prymnesium parvum". It belongs to the prymnesin family and has potent hemolytic and ichthyotoxic properties. In a purified form it appears as a pale yellow solid. "P. parvum" is responsible for red harmful algal blooms worldwide, causing massive fish killings. When these algal blooms occur, this compound poses a threat to the local fishing industry. This is especially true for brackish water, as the compound can reach critical concentrations more easily.
Structure and reactivity.
The structural formula of prymnesin-2 is: C96H136Cl3NO35. The compound has two chiral centers, at the carbon atoms C14 and C85. The molecule is amphoteric, which means that it can act both as base and an acid. This is because all 16 hydroxyls, except for one at C32, are concentrated on carbons C48-84, and there α--xylofuranose moiety at C77. This might lead to interaction with biomembranes, which is thought to be the basis of its toxicity. The difference between prymnesin-1 and prymnesin-2 is the glycosidic residues: L-arabinose, D-galactose and D-ribose, yet prymnesin-2 and prymnesin-1 show comparable activities. Prymnesins also have unique features: The possession of only one methyl, but three chlorine atoms, acetylene bonds, sugars and an amino group.
Synthesis.
There is not much known about the synthesis of prymnesin-1 and prymnesin-2 "in vivo." However, it is likely that both are derived from acetate-related metabolism, based on knowledge about the structure of the prymnesins. In general primary and secondary metabolites such as fatty acids, polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides are synthesised by the acetate pathway
Mechanism of action.
The mechanism of action of prymnesin-2 remains to be determined. Prymnesin-2 and prymnesin-1 show comparable activities. Prymnesin-2 has shown multiple functionalities, such as potent hemolytic activity and diverse biological activities, such as mouse lethality, ichthyotoxicity and activity inducing Ca2+ influx into cultured cells. The hemolytic potency of prymnesin-2 exceeds that of plant saponin by 50.000 times.
Prymnesin-2 causes hemolysis by direct interaction between toxin and cell surface. Partly due to interaction with cellular lipids, mainly to interaction with a specific binding site on the blood cell surface. This is supported by the observation of competitive inhibition by the prymnesin-2 analogues, which assume the presence of a specific binding site on the blood cell surface. Also the process of toxin molecule aggregation may be involved in the main mechanism of the haemolytic activity.
Toxicity.
Prymnesin-2 is an ichthyotoxic compound with the ability to hemolyze blood. 2.5 nM is needed for a 50% hemolysis rate of a 1% rat blood cell suspension, and 9 nM is enough for killing freshwater fish. The hemolytic and ichthyotoxic properties increase when the pH of the solution rises from 7 to 8.
Prymnesin-2 causes calcium ion influx into C6 rat glioma cells at a concentration of 70 nM.
Besides the lytic effect on blood cells, hepatocytes, Hela cells and artificial liposomes are affected by prymnesin-2.
As seen in the table below, prymnesin-2 is highly hemolytic for blood cells of different animal species, even when compared to the already highly hemolytic toxin saponin.
Effects on animals.
In the US, the first recorded "P. parvum" bloom occurred in 1985 in a semi-arid region of the country (Pecos River, Texas). Since then, the incidence of "P. parvum" blooms dramatically increased in the US, where the organism has invaded lakes and rivers throughout southern regions and most recently into northern regions. The magnitude of "P. parvum" blooms are also increasing over the past decade compared to 30 years ago, with massive fish killings as result.

Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) (est. 8 March 1967), formerly Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation (HSIDC), headquartered at Panchkula, is a 100% state-owned agency of the government of Haryana in the Indian state of Haryana. For ease of doing business, Haryana is the first state in India to introduce a labour policy in 2005 and Land Pooling Policy in 2017, for which HSIIDC acts as the nodal agency. Haryana Financial Corporation provides financial assistance for setting up new industrial units and for the expansion and diversification of the existing industries. Various universities, educational and training institutes, including the nation's first skills university Haryana Vishwakarma Skill University, provide the human resources to capitalise on the infrastructure created by the HSIIDC.
HSVP is a related government owned agency responsible for the urban development.
History.
"Haryana State Industrial Development Corporation" (HSIDC), was formed on 8 March 1967 by the Department of Industries &amp; Commerce, Haryana to promote medium and large industries for rapid industrialisation. HSIDC was renamed to the "Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation" (HSIIDC) in 2005.
HSIIDC organisation.
Objectives.
HSIIDC was formed to develop integrated industrial, commercial, special economic zones (SEZ)s, technology parks,
 Integrated Multimodal Logistics Hubs, road, rail, sports and public infrastructure in the state of Haryana in joint venture or public–private partnership. HSIIDC develops the basic infrastructure facilities such as internal roads, water supply, external electrification and affluent disposal system and then allots the industrial plots. Area in Haryana with they have well-developed infrastructure have easier access to markets for raw materials and finished products, credit, skilled labour, etc., hence HSIIDC has formed several subsidiaries to develop infrastructure in various sectors across the state.
Divisions.
The authority has divided the districts of Haryana into four divisions or zones except Gurugram.
Industrial clusters and theme parks.
Haryana has developed at least 11 specialized Industrial Clusters and Theme Parks in the state of Haryana.
Mega food parks.
Haryana, as a food surplus state, is vital for India's and global food security which also brings economic benefits to the state.
Mega Food Parks are approved by the Union Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MOFPI) which provides grants up to Rs 50 crores for each food park to a consortium of companies.
Multi-Modal Logistics Parks of India.
Multi-Modal Logistics Parks in India (MMLPI) is a government of India initiative to lower the logistics cost and time, enhance value add and boost economy. As of July 2021, MoRTH has planned to develop 35 MMLPs under Public-Private Partnership (PPP) in Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer (DBFOT) mode. Based on the detailed project report (DPR), feasibility study and approved bidding document, the tender will be invited from companies. The bidding documents (The Model Concession Agreement and Request for Proposal) is being finalised for these 35 MMLPs, each of which will have a minimum area of 100 acres (40.5 hectares), with various modes of transport access, and comprising mechanized warehouses, specialized storage solutions such as cold storage, facilities for mechanized material handling and inter-modal transfer container terminals, and bulk and break-bulk cargo terminals. Logistics parks will further provide value-added services such as customs clearance with bonded storage yards, quarantine zones, testing facilities, and warehousing management services. Provisions will also be made for late-stage manufacturing activities such as kitting and final assembly, grading, sorting, labelling and packaging activities, re-working, and returns management.
Each MMLP Among these MMLP, Haryana has 1 following MMLP:
Additional following MMLP are at planning stages:
Industrial estates and townships.
An industrial are developed on at least 1500 acres of contiguous land is defrined as the "Industrial Estate" (IE), smaller industrial areas are called "Industrial Model Township" (IMT – denoted by an asterisk or star symbol) and an IT Park (denoted by double asterisk or star symbol). Haryana has at least 24 IEs, 7 IMT and 1 IT Park including the following:
Policies.
HSIIDC is the nodal agency for both labour policy and land pooling policy of the state.
Labour Policy.
Haryana Labour Policy (HLP) was introduced in 2005 to enhance the ease of doing business in the state.
Land Pooling Policy.
Haryana Land Pooling Policy (HLPP), approved in January 2018, is used by the HSVP for acquiring land from the landlords for developing residential sectors. Landlords join the scheme voluntarily and at least 70% landowners must agree to pool their contiguous land, who receive INR50,000 per acre per year till the land is developed. After the land is developed, the landlords also will receive 33% of the developed residential plots in proportion to the land contributed by them to the pool, 33% will be sold by HSVP, 33% will be used for developing services such as roads and parks.
Entreprneur Center.
Haryana Entreprneur Center is a single-windoe service centre for providing 70 types of services of 17 departments under one roof. Of the 76,000 applications, 53,000 applications has been dealth with.

Diamant (Antwerp premetro station)

Diamant premetro station is an Antwerp Premetro station. Located under the "Pelikaanstraat" and next to Antwerp Central Station, it is served by lines 2, 6, 9 and 15.
This station was built during the second construction phase (opened on March 10, 1980) and is the deepest used premetro station in Antwerp. Because the "Pelikaanstraat" is a very narrow street, the station was built as a ± 200 meters long corridor in four levels.
The level -1 is a long entrance hall with exits along the "De Keyserlei", Antwerp Central Station and the parking underneath the "Astridplein" (with an underground passage to Astrid). The exit at the corner the "Pelikaanstraat" and the "Vestingstraat" is out of order, and is now used as an emergency exit.
The level -2 is a second entrance hall for direct access to Antwerp Central Station and the access to the 90 meters long platforms. The level -3 is the platform towards Opera and Astrid. The level -4 is the deepest and goes to Plantin and out of town.
In 2009-2010 the station was converted with better signage and elevators for better accessibility towards wheelchair users. The level -1 was converted to a corridor. The corridor to the premetro station Astrid and the exits on the "Koningin Astridplein" are from that period. 
In 1980 only tram routes 2 and 15 served this station. On October 27, 2007, tram route 6 joined, and on September 1, 2012, tram route 9 joined.

Arthur Seguin

Arthur Seguin (full name Arthur Edward Sheldon Seguin; 7 April 1809 – 13 December 1852) was an English operatic bass singer. He appeared in opera houses in London in the 1830s; from 1838 he lived in America, appearing in New York and touring the USA and Canada.
Early life and career.
Seguin was born in London on 7 April 1809. His father, Ralph Arthur Seguin (1781/2–1865), was for many years secretary at Her Majesty's Theatre; his mother was Sarah "née" Smythe. He was of Irish descent. He was educated at the Royal Academy of Music, from which he narrowly escaped dismissal for some youthful breaches of discipline in 1827. In that year he came into prominence by his singing at a students' public concert in the Hanover Square Rooms. His performance of the part of Basilio in Rossini's "The Barber of Seville", at the first dramatic performance of the Royal Academy of Music on 8 December 1828, was warmly praised by the press. On 6 November 1830 he was in the academy's production of Lord Burghersh's opera "Catherine", Ann Childe (who subsequently became his wife) filling the title-role. A reviewer wrote: "... in the concerted pieces... his fine sonorous bass came in with a charming effect."
Early in 1831 he sang Polyphemus in a stage representation of Handel's "Acis and Galatea" at the Queen's Theatre, Tottenham Street, under the management of George Macfarren. In 1832 Seguin was engaged at Drury Lane, where he appeared with Maria Malibran in Bellini's "La Sonnambula", and during the two following years, and from 1835 to 1837, he sang at Covent Garden. His performance of Masetto in the revival of Mozart's "Don Giovanni" in February 1833 was successful, and in 1835 he was in Beethoven's "Fidelio", as Rocco.
In May 1836, appearing with Maria Malibran, he created the role of Synnelet in Balfe's "The Maid of Artois" at Drury Lane, and in August 1838 he created the part of the baron in George Alexander Macfarren's "The Devil's Opera" at the English Opera House.
America.
In that year he left England for America, where he first appeared as the Count in Rooke's "Amilie, or the Love Test" on 15 October at the National Theatre, New York. In America he founded an operatic company, The Seguin Troupe, which toured successfully in the United States and Canada, including in the summer of 1840 a season of opera at the Theatre Royal in Montreal, Canada.
A concert given by Anna Bishop at the Tripler Hall, New York in 1850 was reviewed: "Mr Seguin sang the two great bass songs from the "Creation", in pure and classical style. He has a grand voice, a true "basso profondo", rich, deep, flowing... We have but one fault to find in him — he lacks somewhat in fire..."
Seguin is said to have been elected a chief by an Indian tribe, an honour he shared with Edmund Kean. He died in New York in 1852. His was described as "one of the finest bass voices ever heard" ("The Athenæum", 1853, page 115), and he was also noted as a comic actor.

Tsing Yi Concern Group

Tsing Yi Concern Group (; TYCG) is a pressure group formed in 1983 by a group of social workers to promote grassroots participation in local affairs in Tsing Yi.
It opposed the Mobil Oil depot storing inflammable petroleum products and liquefied petro-gas which would caused chemical pollutions to the residential areas in Tsing Yi, notably the Mayfair Garden which was only fifty metres away from the depot. The leakage of the confidential Hazard Potential Consultancy Report in late 1983 helped the TYCG to mobilise residents for relocation and reduction of hazardous industries in Tsing Yi.
The group also actively participated in the Kwai Chung and Tsing Yi District Board, which led to split of membership between the Tsing Yi Concern Group and the Tsing Yi Action Group which was formed by the defected TYCG members.
In 1989, it became one of the affiliated member of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China (HKASDPMC) in support of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. It became increasingly pro-Beijing after 1997.

The Sweet and the Bitter (1967 film)

The Sweet and the Bitter, also known as Savage Justice, is a 1967 Canadian film directed by James Clavell.
Production.
In 1962 Clavell signed a two-picture deal with Panorama, a Canadian company, to produce and direct "Circle of Greed" in April and "The Bitter and the Sweet" in June. The former was not made. The film was the first production from a Canadian Company, Commonwealth, established by Oldřich Václavek, a Czech immigrant to Canada. The budget of CA $325,000 was raised from Canadian sources.
Filming started 4 June 1962 in Vancouver at Commonwealth's Hollyburn Studios (later known as Panorama Studios).
"I want to tell a story", said Clavell at the time. "If my story doesn't hold people, doesn't touch their emotions, then it is of no use. I go to the theatre and watch the reactions of the audience to my lines. They are quick to respond if a line is right. If they don't, I know something is wrong. "King Rat" is my first published novel and to write it I used what I had learned."
Clavell enjoyed Vancouver and bought a house there. It was there he wrote "King Rat".
The film was a "production nightmare". The producers and the studio owners wound up in a five-year legal battle that resulted in RCA stripping $350,000 worth of sound equipment from the dubbing stage. The studio would be barely used over the next few years, making only "The Trap" (1966), The Clan of the Cave Bear (1986), The Hitchhiker (TV Series) (1985,1986) and "The Littlest Hobo".
Reception.
The film was not released until 1967.

Listed buildings in Bridgnorth

Bridgnorth is a civil parish in Shropshire, England. It contains 252 listed buildings that are recorded in the National Heritage List for England. Of these, one is listed at Grade I, the highest of the three grades, twelve are at Grade II*, the middle grade, and the others are at Grade II, the lowest grade. The parish contains the town of Bridgnorth and the small villages of Quatford, Danesford, and Oldbury. The River Severn passes through the town, and divides it into two parts. The part on the western side is mainly hilly, and is known as High Town, and the part by the river and on its east side is much flatter, and is known as Low Town. The two parts are joined by a bridge over the river.
A castle and a collegiate church were established in High Town in the early 12th century, and the town grew following that. In the 13th century walls were built around the town, with five gateways. Most of the town was burnt down in 1646 during the Civil War, and it was rebuilt afterwards. Prosperity came in the 18th century with increasing river trade, but it has since declined, and the arrival of the railway in the 1850s did little to halt the decline. The town has since developed as a commuter town for the nearby cities.
Most of the listed buildings are in the High Town area of Bridgnorth, with a smaller group in Low Town near the bridge. The majority of these are houses and shops, many of them timber framed and dating from the 15th to 17th century, the best of these being Bishop Percy's House. Only a small fragment of the castle and the town walls have survived, and the only gateway is North Gate which is a 20th-century rebuilding on the original site. There are two churches that have retained a significant amount of medieval fabric, St Leonard's Church and St Mary Magdalene's Church in Quatford. The other listed buildings include public houses, hotels, clubs, offices, civic buildings, other churches, bridges, a bank, a folly, a warehouse, railway stations, a former textile mill, a drinking fountain, two conduit heads, a school, a war memorial, and a telephone kiosk.

Sarah Lavanburg Straus

Sarah Lavanburg Straus (1861–1945) was an American philanthropist and wife of diplomat Oscar Straus.
Biography.
Born Sarah Lavanburg to a Jewish family in 1861 in New York City, the daughter of Hannah (née Seller) and Louis Lavanburg. Her father was an investment banker. She had one brother, merchant Frederick Lavanburg. She was educated in private schools. On April 19, 1882, she married Bavarian-immigrant and American diplomat Oscar Straus. From 1887 to 1889, she lived in Istanbul where her husband served as ambassador and she became acquainted with German-Jewish industrialist Baron Maurice de Hirsch and Baroness Clara de Hirsch. In 1891, the Strausses persuaded Baron Hirsch to establish the Baron de Hirsch Fund which focused on aiding Jewish immigrants relocating from Russia; and the Clara de Hirsch Home for Working Girls. Straus was appointed the first president of the Clara De Hirsch Home for Working Girls where she served until her death. In 1915, the Immigrant Home's operation was taken over by Straus and her brother, and renamed the Hannah Lavanburg Home in honor of their mother.
In 1926, her husband died. In 1929, she financed and participated in a four-month expedition to central Africa for the American Museum of Natural History to obtain birds from Uganda, Kenya, and Nyasaland (now Malawi). In 1934, she financed and participated in an eight-month expedition to West Africa for the Field Museum of Natural History to collect bird specimens in Senegal, French Sudan, and Niger territory. Straus served on the board of the Fred L. Lavanburg Foundation.
Personal life.
Straus had three children with her husband: Mildred Straus Schafer (born 1883), Aline Straus Hockstader (born 1889), and Roger Williams Straus (1891–1957, married to Gladys Eleanor Guggenheim). Strauss died on November 9, 1945 at her home in New York City. She was a member of Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan. Her grandson is Roger Williams Straus Jr.

Iain M Hambling

Iain M Hambling is the historian and archivist of English pottery company T G Green &amp; Co Ltd (1864 – 2007), manufacturers of Cornishware, a striped kitchenware brand. The company was based at Church Gresley, Derbyshire.
Activities as historian and archivist.
Starting as a collector of Cornishware in 1991, his collection grew and was largely featured in Paul Atterbury's first Cornish Ware &amp; Domestic Pottery book.
First discussing Cornishware on the BBC's "Antiques Roadshow" (series 19, 1996–7), he went on to make another two appearances with other T G Green designs and later a half-hour programme on Channel 4, "Collectors' Lot".
There was an active Collectors' Club between 1996 and 2001, for which Hambling wrote and advised in 'Iain's Corner'. The club folded upon the acquisition of T G Green by neighbouring company Mason Cash.
Increasingly aware of the many other unrecorded patterns dating from 1864, Hambling started to build collections of the patterns and created a virtual online museum. A second Atterbury book, concentrating on the many other domestic wares produced, followed in 2001.
Hambling continued to piece together collections of designs and patterns, concentrating initially on the Art Deco sets of the 1930s, and later the Victorian sets from the company's inception, as well as sourcing a lot of the original paperwork, tools and moulds which had been gradually removed from the now-derelict factory site at Church Gresley by treasure hunters and opportunists.
Through the means of Facebook, Hambling created a dedicated page to the pottery's history and founded a Collectors' Group in 2008, now with 2,000 members. Since 2016 there has been a privately run museum in the Swadlincote area, displaying a majority of the patterns produced from the family-owned period of 1864 to 1974, and the items from the original 'Cornish Ware Museum' run by the late Derek Green from his business in Hartley Wintney, returning the permanent display back to its original area of manufacture which will extend publicly in 2025.

Afrino sheep

The Afrino is a breed of sheep originating from South Africa. It was developed by crossing Ronderib Afrikaner sheep with Merino and South African Mutton Merino (SAMM) sheep, and is classified as a Merino breed.
The Afrino was developed at the Carnarvon Research Station. It was made using 25% Afrikaner, 25% Merino and 50% SAMM genetics. This allowed scientists to combine the improved wool and carcass traits of the Merino and SAMM with the indigenous Afrikaner breed that was suited to the environmental conditions of South Africa.
It is a minor, dual-purpose breed farmed for meat and wool in South Africa. It produces fine wool. The Afrino is also used as a terminal sire in meat production to increase early growth in lambs and reach slaughter weight sooner. It has a relatively low rate of inbreeding compared to other South African breeds.

Graham Henderson (cultural entrepreneur)

Graham Henderson is a cultural entrepreneur based in London. He is best known for developing the arts organisation Poet in the City. In 2014 he launched a second arts organisation, the Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation, committed to cross-arts commissioning and to championing a new funding model for the arts. Henderson has also been involved in many other arts-related initiatives including the development of a public art consultancy, the creation of an international arts network and a campaign to create a new investment fund for the arts.
Early life and education.
Henderson was born in Somerset in 1964, was educated at Taunton School in Taunton and Millfield School in Street, Somerset, and spent a year in Ontario, Canada before doing a history degree at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge between 1983 and 1986.
Early career.
Graham Henderson’s career has spanned both the City of London and the arts. A qualified solicitor, he previously worked as a commercial litigation lawyer at one of the largest law firms based in the City of London, Clifford Chance. He took a sabbatical break from legal practice in 2000–01 to become a consultant in the specialist travel business in which he created and marketed specialist dance and music activity holidays for both Dance Holidays Ltd and WOMAD. In 2003 he produced Coach of Black Water, an exhibition of Cuban art photographs, which took place at the Menier Gallery in Southwark, the first sponsored exhibition to take place at this venue. In 2004 he launched The Company of Adventurers Ltd in an attempt to raise funding for independent arts and cultural documentary films. And in 2005 he was responsible for arranging the translation and publication of "Kindred Spirits," a collected edition of poems by the Cuban poet Regino E Boti, known as "the poet of Guantanamo", which was published by Mango Publications.
The Lorca case.
In 2002, Graham Henderson was the solicitor in charge of the high-profile case concerning ownership of the manuscript of the famous poetry collection "Poet in New York" by the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca, assassinated by Franco's militia at the start of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. This case resulted in a 10-day trial at the High Court in London, presided over by Judge Peter Smith. The case was a success for Henderson and his law firm, Morgan Cole, who were acting under a conditional fee agreement. Henderson was keen to celebrate the life and work of the poet and organised a special event in the Great Room at Christie’s on the eve of the auction of the manuscript. The event was attended by, amongst others, the ambassadors of all the main countries associated with the manuscript, Spain, Cuba and Mexico. In order that the event should be bipartisan in nature, he invited Poet in the City, a project founded in 1998 by City of London lawyers, to present the event on his behalf. The success of the event led Rosamund McCarthy, its founder and first chair, to invite Henderson to run Poet in the City.
Poet in the City.
Initially Henderson continued to run Poet in the City as a project of the Poetry Society, to which it was affiliated. However, he became increasingly interested in the opportunities it presented to reach out to new audiences for poetry and to access new sources of funding to support poetry education. Establishing Poet in the City as a separate charity in 2006, he obtained substantial sponsorships for it, including sponsorships from leading brands such as Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Pfizer, Linklaters and Lloyds of London. He also achieved its selection as a National Portfolio Organisation by Arts Council England in 2010. Between 2006 and 2014, Henderson led on programming over 50 high-profile poetry events every year in London and South East England, together with a wide range of other poetry-related projects and activities, including short films, national poetry tours and public art commissions. After organising Poet in the City's successful transition to a new chief executive in April 2014, he remained as a trustee of the charity, and as its public art consultant, until April 2016.
The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation.
In 2007, Henderson became involved in the campaign to save the Regency property at 8 Royal College Street that had been occupied by the French poets Arthur Rimbaud and Paul Verlaine in 1873. Henderson persuaded the owner, Michael Corby, to leave the property as a legacy gift in his will. The Rimbaud and Verlaine Foundation was created to take advantage of this gift, and with the long-term goal of establishing a European-style "poetry house" at the property, providing a cultural and educational resource for the residents of the London Borough of Camden. Incubated inside of Poet in the City, the Foundation was launched as a separate organisation and as a registered charity in 2014. However, rather than just be a small house museum the Foundation decided to use the poets as an inspiration for a wider mission to champion the arts, create new sources of earned income, and provide platforms for talented up-and-coming artists across many different art forms. Becoming Chief Executive of the new Foundation in April 2014, Henderson delivered a programme of over 30 cross-arts events and original arts commissions during 2014–17 that featured opera, classical and rock music, theatre, film, sculpture and other art forms, as well as poetry and literature. Henderson has also been responsible for developing a new business model for the arts centred on the development of new sources of earned income, and for devising a new form of investment bond suitable as a means of attracting investment to arts organisation.
Kindred Spirits – The European Poetry House Network.
As part of his role in championing the idea of the "poetry house" as a new and streamlined business model for the arts, Henderson created an international collaboration, bringing together seven "poetry houses" in six different European countries. Kindred Spirits seeks to promote international cultural exchange and to develop new business and funding models for the arts, as well as being an arts network and a vehicle for celebrating a shared European culture.
Social capital building.
Henderson has long championed the arts as an important source of social capital, and as a fundamental building block of a healthy civil society. This has directly informed his work, both in promoting a new approach to public art and in seeking an innovative new funding model for arts organisations.
Public art.
As public art consultant for Poet in the City, between 2014 and 2016, Graham Henderson created important new sources of income for the arts. In 2015, working in partnership with Richmond upon Thames Council and the architectural design practice Feilden Clegg Bradley Studios, he conceived, designed, built and installed "Pope's Urn", a contemporary piece of public art, inspired by the poetry of Alexander Pope. Enjoying a central position on the Twickenham riverside, the sculpture was commissioned to celebrate the 2015 Rugby World Cup, and was opened in a ceremony in September 2015. This work provided an important source of earned income for Poet in the City in 2015. Associated with this work, Henderson has also been involved in high-level advocacy for innovative approaches to public art, including an active role in the 2014 Farrell Review of Architecture and the Built Environment, writing the official essay in support of its findings, and continues to work with BEAM in promoting new approaches to the commissioning of public art.
Limited profit investment fund for the arts.
As an elected member of the Culture Forum in 2010, Henderson played an important part in developing innovative ideas for the funding of the arts, including an influential paper which led directly to the establishment in 2014 of an Arts Impact Fund. However, Graham Henderson parted company with the Fund over the insistence on the part of some its funders that investment in arts organisations should also achieve so-called "social outcomes". He continues to campaign for the original funds that he proposed in 2010, a limited profit fund designed to help arts organisations to make money from their existing assets and intellectual property rights. Henderson argues that investment which allows arts organisations to develop their sources of earned income will release a great deal of entrepreneurial activity in the arts, particularly amongst small-medium enterprise arts organisations, and will lead to a much more resilient funding basis for the arts sector as a whole.
"Modern Poetry in Translation".
Graham Henderson has been an active board member of the journal "Modern Poetry in Translation" since 2008 and is now working with its editor, Clare Pollard, to deliver a programme of poetry and translation placements in Camden schools.
Oxford Cultural Leaders programme.
In 2015 Henderson was selected, along with 17 other leaders from the arts, cultural and museums sectors, to be part of a new residential programme, Oxford Cultural Leaders, delivered by Oxford University Museums in partnership with the Saïd Business School. The programme, held for the first time in 2015, brings together leaders to experiment and take risks, to explore new business models and ways of working and to develop innovative organisational cultures. Henderson now runs the alumni network for all those who have passed through the programme, encouraging them to continue to meet and to collaborate.
Jan Patočka.
Henderson has been interested for many years in the ideas of the Czech philosopher Jan Patočka (1907–1977). In particular, Patočka's ideas for "putting soul in the city", and of recapturing the relationship between the arts and social capital building (and between culture and political engagement) characteristic of the ancient Athenians, have been much used by Henderson in his own championship of the arts. As of 2018 he is involved in a project, working in partnership with the Jan Patočka Archive in Prague and with the phenomenologist Erin Plunkett, to publish, for the first time, an English-language edition of the philosopher’s selected works.
Personal life.
Graham Henderson lives in Twickenham, south-west London.

Einbeck-Salzderhelden station

Einbeck-Salzderhelden station is the most important station in Einbeck in the German state of Lower Saxony. It is classified by Deutsche Bahn as a category 5 station and is located in the district of Einbeck of Salzderhelden.
History.
The section from Alfeld via Kreiensen and Northeim to Göttingen on the old North–South railway was connected to the railway network on 31 July 1854. The station of the then independent municipality of Salzderhelden was opened only one day later, on 1 August 1854. The station building was built according to the plans of Conrad Wilhelm Hase.
The line from Salzderhelden to Einbeck (now Einbeck Mitte) was opened on 10 September 1879, turning it into a junction station.
All transport operations on the Salzderhelden–Einbeck line were taken over by the "Ilmebahn" (Ilme Railway) from Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1954. Passenger services on the line were discontinued by 1975 and replaced by bus route 230.
Salzderhelden was incorporated into the municipality of Einbeck on 1 March 1974.
The station was renamed Einbeck in 1978 and the former Einbeck station was renamed Einbeck Mitte.
Until 2002, the track of the Ilme Railway still existed as far as Dassel and it was then gradually dismantled back to Juliusmühle. In the same year, the Einbeck-Salzderhelden – Einbeck Mitte line was transferred from DB to "Ilmebahn GmbH".
The station has been called Einbeck-Salzderhelden since 1994.
Transport services.
Rail services.
Salzderhelden is located on the Hanoverian Southern Railway and it has been served approximately hourly since December 2005 by a Regional-Express service, RE 2, operated by metronom Eisenbahngesellschaft and connecting with Göttingen, Kreiensen and Hanover.
The line to Einbeck has not been regularly used by passenger services since 1984, but it is occasionally used by special passenger trains and by freight traffic.
Bus services.
Einbeck is now connected to Einbeck-Salzderhelden station by bus route 230, which operates on the Einbeck–Salzderhelden–Northeim route.
All bus and rail services in the Einbeck area are managed by the "Verkehrsverbund Süd-Niedersachsen" (Southern Lower Saxony transport association, VSN).
Prospects.
There are efforts to restore regular passenger services on the Einbeck-Salzderhelden – Einbeck Mitte section of the Ilmebahn. The reactivation of this section was found to generate significant economic benefits. 
The operation was due to be resumed at the timetable change in December 2017, but it has been delayed until December 2018.

Back Trail

Back Trail is a 1948 American western film, directed by Christy Cabanne. It stars Johnny Mack Brown, Raymond Hatton, and Mildred Coles, and was released on July 18, 1948.
Plot.
Bob Frazer is a businessman in Brentwood. When he was younger and lived back east he was framed for embezzling funds from his clients by his partner, Frank Gilmore. After getting out of jail, he headed west for a fresh start. However, his partner, who was actually the one who embezzled the funds, followed him west, and is using the threat of exposing his past to blackmail him. In exchange for keeping his secret, particularly from his daughter Helen and her fiancée Terry Dugan, Frazer provides Gilmore with the times and routes of payroll stages, which Gilmore's gang then robs.
Johnnie Mack is hired to investigate the series of robberies, and when arrives in town he meets up with his old friend, Casoose. He suspects that Frazer is somehow involved, but Frazer vehemently denies it. Mack sets up a fake gold shipment, and only tells Frazer about it. When the false shipment is robbed by Gilmore's gang, Mack captures one of the gang, Pacos. Mack is now convinced of Frazer's involvement. After Frazer breaks Pacos out of jail, following Gilmore's orders, he is confronted by Mack. He asks Mack for 24 hours to clean up the mess he created. However, Mack realizes that Frazer intends to kill Gilmore, and stops him before he can commit murder. When Frazer breaks down and confesses his past to Mack, he is overheard by Helen and Terry, who tell him that they don't care about his past.
Mack, Frazer, and the local sheriff come up with a plan to trap Gilmore. The sheriff arrests Frazer and locks him jail. When Gilmore arrives to shoot Frazer, Frazer tells him that he has written down everything they have done together and locked it in his safe, and it was to be given to the sheriff in the event of his death. Gilmore leaves and attempts to break into the safe, where he is confronted by Mack and Casoose. However, they are surprised by Gilmore's gang, allowing Gilmore to escape. After subduing the gang, Mack and Casoose chase after Gilmore, eventually catch him and arrest him.
Helen and Terry get married and leave on their honeymoon.

Jozef Cantré

Jozef Cantré (26 December 1890 - 29 August 1957) was a Belgian sculptor and illustrator. He was one of the main artists in the development of the Flemish Expressionism style.
Biography.
Jozef Cantré was born in Ghent in 1890, four years after his brother Jan Frans. His father was a house painter. He studied art at the Royal Academy, together with Frans Masereel; his teachers included Jean Delvin and Felix Metdepenningen. He was politically active in a socialist youth movement and later created the "Rode Jeugd" ("Red Youth").
He studied Literature at the Von Bissing University from 1916 on, together with the poet Richard Minne. Already in March 1918 he was appointed lector in drawing. His role in this university, created by the German occupier, led to his conviction in 1920, when he was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. This sentence was removed in 1929.
On 27 October 1918, when it became clear that Germany would lose the war, Cantré fled the country. He then lived in Blaricum until 1921 and then in Oosterwijk, both in the Netherlands, where he was joined by Frits Van den Berghe and Gustave de Smet. In 1930 he returned to Belgium where he moved to Sint-Martens-Latem, which would become the center of the Flemish art during the interbellum. By 1931 he lived in the nearby Astene, where Hubert Malfait became his neighbour. Afterwards he moved to Ghent.
Between 1941 and 1946 he was a teacher at the La Cambre Art Institute.
He was married to Martha Vandaele; they had one son, Walter Cantré.
Art.
His early art is influenced by Georges Minne and Constantin Meunier. Later influences include fauvism, cubism and German Expressionism, before he became one of the founders of the so-called Flemish expressionism.
He was one of the main avant-garde illustrators in Belgium between World War I and World War II as a member of "De Vijf" ("The Five") together with his brother Jan Frans Cantré, Joris Minne, Frans Masereel and Henri Van Straeten. Most of his graphic work consisted of engravings and woodcuts, as stand-alone works, ex-libris, or book illustrations. As a sculptor, he worked in wood, clay and bronze.
Together with Frits Van den Berghe and Gustave de Smet he is also considered one of the pioneers of the Flemish Expressionism, and together with Oscar Jespers the main sculptor in the movement.

Storytelling (Fred Frith album)

Storytelling: Live at Theater Gütersloh is a 2017 live album by English guitarist Fred Frith. It was performed by Frith in a trio with Danish saxophonist Lotte Anker and Swiss percussionist Samuel Dühsler on 18 March 2017 at the Theater Gütersloh in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. The recording was released on 18 August 2017 by Intuition in Germany as Volume 12 of its "European Jazz Legends" series.
"Storytelling" comprises three pieces of improvised music, plus an interview with Frith conducted by Götz Bühler. "The New York City Jazz Record" listed the album as one of its "Honorable Mentions New Releases" in 2017.
Reception.
Reviewing the album in "DownBeat", Martin Longley wrote that the trio switch freely between "complete abstraction and repeating structures" and "free-form and melody". He said that in the "Storytelling" suite there is "a gathering sense of mystery" as the music unfolds, before it becomes "rougher, more agitated", and culminates in a "hyperactive climax" at the end of "Chapter 3". Martin Laurentius wrote in "Jazz Thing" that on this album the trio follow their instincts. He described the "Storytelling" suite as complex avant-garde music comprising polyphonic layers with rhythmic overlays that swell and fade before building to a climax at the end.

David Gilpin

David Gilpin (6 April 1863 – 21 May 1952), was an Australian schoolteacher, businessman, accountant and local government politician who served two terms as Lord Mayor of Sydney and was the last Mayor of Camperdown, leading the negotiations that led to Camperdown Council's amalgamation with the City of Sydney in 1908.
Early life.
David Gilpin was born on 6 April 1863 at Carlisle, Cumberland, England, and emigrated to Australia aged 3 with his parents in 1866, arriving in Brisbane before moving to Sydney in 1867. Gilpin began his career in 1883 when he was appointed a public school teacher, serving in various country schools. As a teacher he married Mary Ann Southam at Tilba Tilba on 21 October 1884 and they had five sons and two daughters.
Later becoming a Sydney produce merchant and accountant, Gilpin settled with his family in the inner Sydney suburb of Camperdown. 
Political career.
Gilpin first took elected office as an Auditor for the Council of the small Municipality of Camperdown in February 1904, but, as secretary of Camperdown Ratepayers Association, soon stood for election as an Alderman for Belmore Ward, to which he was elected in February 1906.
Gilpin however joined the council during a period of severe crisis; the council had been running insolvent for the last few years and the Town Hall where council met was fully mortgaged. In the years before his election, Camperdown aldermen had been seeking to amalgamate with one or several of their neighbouring councils, with little success. Gilpin was elected mayor after the February 1908 municipal elections, and tasked himself with concluding the negotiations for Camperdown amalgamating with the City of Sydney.
Gilpin presided over the final meeting of Camperdown council held on 7 December 1908, with Gilpin noting that "I am very pleased to say that the result of the negotiations, in the form of the present Bill, was unanimously agreed to by this council, and has met with the approval of all the ratepayers of Camperdown. The primary object for which we were elected was the extinction of Camperdown as a municipality, and in a few days this will be an accomplished fact." The council officially ceased to exist and was absorbed into the City of Sydney when the "Sydney Corporation (Amendment) Act 1908" was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales, with the council area becoming the Camperdown Ward returning two aldermen.
In January 1909, Gilpin was elected alongside his fellow former Camperdown alderman and mayor, Charles Mallett, to the Camperdown Ward of the City of Sydney. Gilpin became one of the council's representatives on the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage in March 1922.
Joining the Civic Reform Association when it was created, Gilpin became honorary secretary and was elected Lord Mayor of Sydney for 1923 and 1924.
Gilpin lost his bid for re-election to his Camperdown Ward seat on the council in the 1924 municipal elections and forfeited his seat on the Water Board as a result. However, when the Water Board was reconstituted in March 1925 shortly after as an elected, rather than appointed body, Gilpin, who now lived in Burwood, stood for election and was successful for the Fifth Constituency (Annandale, Ashfield, Burwood, Concord, Enfield, Glebe, Homebush, Leichhardt, Lidcombe, and Strathfield). After gaining re-election for a further four-year term in 1927, Gilpin was defeated in his 1931 bid for re-election by the Mayor of Leichhardt, Andrew Noble Campbell.
Later life and legacy.
Gilpin's wife, Mary Ann, died at their residence, "Kayla", on Parkes Street, Wentworth Falls on 5 November 1938. Gilpin died on 21 May 1952, aged 89 and was buried at Wentworth Falls Church of England Cemetery. Gilpin Street in Camperdown is named after him.

E-engineering

e-engineering is a concept that results from the concatenation of two previous ideas: distance learning and remote laboratories.
History.
Distance learning education has been around since the 19th century when the development of the mail services in England enabled the delivering of correspondence courses by mail. In the second half of the 20th century, audio and television players where the first technological means used to deliver new, more engaging distance learning courses. And despite keeping the same way to communicate with students, the now more fast and reliable postal services, the materials were then much more diversified, ranging from carefully constructed texts and audio and video records to conventional broadcast radio and television, in this case, open to all, students and non-students. These were complemented by live individual or group sessions over the phone, between instructor and students, or among students, enabling real interactive teamwork.
Affect of Internet.
However, the breakthrough that represents a true turning point in distance learning was the introduction of the concept of e-learning during the 90s, boosted by the two most significant advances in the telecommunications area – the Internet network and the invention of the World Wide Web. With the Internet a fast, reliable and interactive channel of communication between instructor and students or among students was now available, enabling a degree of interaction never achieved before in distance learning and comparable to face-to-face classes. On the other hand, the World Wide Web with its hypertext links enabled the construction of much more diversified and engaging materials, supported by audio, image, and video, readily available and highly interactive. This revolution was accompanied by the massification of personal computers, which made them accessible and affordable.
Challenges.
In a decade, from 1990 to 2000, these very expensive machines, complicated to operate and whose access was almost restricted to scientist and engineers and to technical university students, became an indispensable household equipment.
In spite of all these advances, the undergraduate courses on offer were nevertheless restricted. Engineering courses which require the access to specific chemistry, physics, mechanics, electrical machines, electronics or optics laboratories and real-time interaction with equipment and instrumentation, were not available at distance.
This reality is changing due to the creation of remotely accessible laboratories that enable students to perform hands-on lab work remotely, with a level of interactivity and realism never achieved before. A lot of work is being done in the past decade in the area of remote laboratories.
Examples.
In the specialized literature, it is possible to find many examples of different labs for different areas of physics and electrical engineering, each one allowing different degrees of freedom in the configuration of the experiment by the remote user. 
The integration of these remote laboratories as part of fully online undergraduate programs in engineering areas enabled the creation of e-engineering courses. These are e-learning courses in engineering areas where students perform their hands-on laboratory work remotely interacting in real-time with equipment and instrumentation available online 24/7.
The first example of one such course is the L3-EOLES (Electronics and Optics e-Learning for Embedded Systems) course, an entirely online English-taught 3rd year bachelor's degree in Electronics and Optics for Embedded Systems. The course, that started being offered in the school year 2014/15, is currently in its fourth edition. Designed as a specialization year, this course is oriented towards a currently expanding field in the electrical and computer engineering area, the field of electronics and optics for embedded systems. This area of knowledge requires students to be able to perform experimental work to acquire the expected technical experimental skills. The execution of laboratory assignments over the Internet required the development of remotely accessible experimental laboratories enabling students to interact in real-time with real experimental setups. This innovative training has been accredited by the educational authorities in Tunisia, Morocco, and France.

Kate Vitasek

Kate Vitasek (born September 19, 1968) is an American author and educator. She is a faculty member for Graduate and Executive Education at the University of Tennessee Haslam College of Business Her research focuses on the Vested outsourcing business model, sourcing business model theory, the relational contract, and collaborative win-win business relationships. 
Career.
Before joining University of Tennessee, she worked for P&amp;G, Microsoft, Accenture, Stream International, and Modus Media Modus Media International.
At University of Tennessee, Vitasek researches business models. In 2010, Vitasek and two researchers codified their findings on the Vested business model into a methodology to enable organizations to create highly collaborative relationships. Vitasek's work on the Vested business model led to what is known to as Sourcing Business Model theory. Many of Vitasek's books are about the Vested outsourcing collaborative win-win relationships. Vitasek has also done research for the U.S. Air Force on issues relating to contracting logistics and transportation.
Vitasek's recent research has focused on relational contracting. In 2021 she published (with David Frydlinger, Jim Bergman, and Tim Cummins) "Contracting in the New Economy: Using Relational Contracts to Boost Trust and Collaboration in Strategic Business Relationships" which argues for adopting formal relational contracts as the standard for contracting activity. The Nobel laureate Oliver Hart's Foreword in the book notes, “…for a long time I have felt that the traditional approach to contracts, where lawyers try to think of all the possible things that can go wrong in a relationship and include contractual provisions to deal with them, is broken.” Hart added that it “never worked that well, and in an increasingly complex and uncertain world it works even worse.” 
In 2019, Vitasek Frydlinger and Hart collaborated on a "Harvard Business Review" article, "A New Approach to Contracts: How to Build Better long-term strategic partnerships". The authors assert that "a formal relational contract lays a foundation of trust, specifies mutual goals, and establishes governance structures to keep the parties’ expectations and interests aligned over time."
Reviews of works.
"Vested Outsourcing" (2010) describes how to outsource business processes or services. The book identifies potential issues in outsourcing and how companies can best work together for a good outsourcing relationship. Hollye Moss, professor at the Western Carolina University, wrote that the book "takes a new approach to the relationship, creating a win-win scenario. It is well-written, easy to read, and thought-provoking." "Booklist" wrote that "Vested: How P&amp;G, McDonald's and Microsoft are Redefining Winning in Business Relationships" (2012) was a "lively presentation" by the authors and that it "should appeal to businesspeople willing to take a chance on trust and transparency to produce transformative results."
Awards and recognition.
Vitasek was recognized by The Journal of Commerce as a "Woman on the Move in Trade and Transportation" and as a "Rainmaker" by DC Velocity for her contributions to building the supply chain profession. For her work on "Vested", she was named one of Globalization Today's "Powerhouse 25" outsourcing industry leaders. Other accolades include recognition by Logistics Quarterly and Supply Chain Digest as a "Woman in Supply Chain," honored as a "Woman of International Influence" by Global Executive Women, and being named on the Global Sourcing Association's inaugural "A-List".

The Forgiven (2017 film)

The Forgiven is a 2017 British drama film directed by Roland Joffé starring Forest Whitaker, Eric Bana and Jeff Gum. Joffé co-wrote the script with Michael Ashton on the basis of the play "The Archbishop and the Antichrist" by Michael Ashton, which tells a story involving Archbishop Desmond Tutu's search for answers during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and his meetings with the fictional character Piet Blomfeld.
Plot.
After the end of apartheid, Archbishop Desmond Tutu is running the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and visits Cape Town's Pollsmoor Maximum Security Prison to meet with Piet Blomfeld, an ex-security police officer and Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging member, to assess his candidacy for amnesty. Blomfeld is a potential witness to murders committed during the time of Apartheid, particularly the murder of the teenage daughter of Mrs. Morobe, who begs the Archbishop to find answers about her missing daughter. Blomfeld initially shows no regret and no willingness to speak, instead using his time during the meetings to berate the Archbishop with insults. However, when the Archbishop shows him a photograph of a young black girl in his file and tells him that he is in two prisons, (the other being the prison within himself) he begins to reconsider.
Francois Schmidt, one of Blomfeld's fellow officers and a participant in the murders, initially tries to pay off a black gang to assassinate Blomfeld, but Blomfeld (having been affected by the Archbishop's words) spares the life of the prisoner sent to kill him and manages to earn the respect of the gang to the point where they tell Schmidt to fight his own battles. He also forms somewhat of a bond with the prisoner, Benjamin. As this is going on, Howard Varney (one of the members of the Commission) speaks with Mrs. Van der Berghe, who had known Blomfeld when he was a child. He learns that Piet Blomfeld had been friends with a young black girl (the girl in the photograph); his father Rian did not approve and murdered the girl and her entire family before beating Piet so badly he broke his arm. Afterwards the Blomfelds moved to Zimbabwe; while Piet was at boarding school the rest of his family was killed (presumably as retaliation for Rian's crimes.)
Blomfeld ultimately decides to confess, and calls the archbishop. Schmidt arranges for the prison to be locked down and then attacks Blomfeld accompanied by riot troopers; Blomfeld is ultimately beaten to death by the troopers. However, he has sent an audio recording, confessing to the murder of Mrs. Morobe's daughter and her boyfriend, which is played to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (he also leaves Benjamin what little money is in his bank account). Mrs. Morobe confronts Hansi Coetzee, one of the participants in her daughter's murder and ultimately forgives him. Afterwards the Archbishop is met by Linda Coetzee, who thanks him for his work and admits that she hadn't wanted to face what her husband had done.
The movie ends with the Archbishop and his wife visiting the beach he had gone to as a child, now successfully integrated.
Production.
On 2 November 2015, it was announced that Forest Whitaker and Vince Vaughn would star as Archbishop Desmond Tutu and the fictional character Piet Blomfield, respectively, in the film adaptation of Michael Ashton's play "The Archbishop and the Antichrist", to be directed by Roland Joffé. Joffé also co-wrote the script with Ashton, which would be produced by Craig Baumgarten. On 27 October 2016, Eric Bana joined the film to play the brutal murderer Blomfeld, replacing Vaughn. The film was retitled "The Forgiven" and would be produced by Joffé with Baumgarten through Link Entertainment and Zaheer Goodman-Bhyat through Light and Dark Films.
Release.
The film premiered at the London Film Festival on 13 October 2017. It was also shown as the closing film at the Pan African Film Festival on 19 February 2018 and was shown at the Belgrade Film Festival on 28 February 2018 before being released in the United States on 9 March 2018.
Reception.
Box office.
"The Forgiven" grossed $39,177 in territories outside North America, sales of its DVD/Blu-ray releases have cashed $54,156.
Critical response.
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 55% based on 22 reviews and an average rating of 6.2/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 41 out of 100 based on 9 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Gary Goldstein of the "Los Angeles Times" wrote that the 'sluggishly paced film's disparate parts never come together as a compelling whole.' Glenn Kenny of "The New York Times" wrote that the film by Roland Joffé, who is 'not known for a light touch', 'is heavy-handed from its early texts explaining apartheid through its end credits' but praised the performances of Forest Whitaker and Eric Bana.

Pipkin (volcano)

Pipkin (also known as Malpais Crater) is a volcano in California, with activity during the Quaternary. The surface of erupted lava flows is weathered, and argon-argon dating and potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 770,000 ± 40,000 and 600,000 years before present, respectively.
The volcano lies in the Rodman Mountains. The high and wide Pipkin cinder cone probably erupted the lava flows which extend to its north and form a lava flow field which has the appearance of a mesa. The cone itself consists of lava bombs and scoria with red and black colours. Lava flows from the vent propagated through Kane Wash and into the Mojave River valley; it is possible that the lava diverted part of the wash into neighbouring Sheep Springs Wash.
The cone is the site of a quarry. Pipkin was mined since the 1950s for its ash.

Blaire White

Blaire White (born September 14, 1993) is an American YouTuber and political commentator. Politically right-wing, White has been critical of third-wave feminism, activists she views as social justice warriors, and activist movements such as Black Lives Matter.
Early life.
White was assigned male at birth. She described feeling gender dysphoria from a young age, saying that "My earliest memories were those of gender dysphoria: feeling uncomfortable in my skin and incapable of meeting male ideals". When she was 20 years old, she came out as transgender to her family and friends and began feminizing hormone therapy in 2015. White attended California State University, Chico, where she studied computer science. While attending college, she appeared on a friend's live stream, and commenters encouraged her to start a YouTube channel of her own.
YouTube career.
While studying in college, White was feeling dissatisfied and frustrated with the way some contentious issues regarding gender equality, men's rights and feminism were being addressed during class by her professors and fellow students. Moreover, she felt like her beliefs weren't being equally represented on the political discourse at campus, hence White began posting mainly anti-feminist political videos on the platform in December 2015, and used it as an outlet for expressing her dissenting beliefs. She continued making videos about her views on social issues like gender politics. She has criticized the Black Lives Matter movement, and told "Penthouse" that she had to contact the Federal Bureau of Investigation as a result of backlash.
White has uploaded her political debates with other YouTubers, commentators and comedians. She has also appeared on political talk show "The Rubin Report" several times, discussing issues including the North Carolina Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act, which requires individuals to only use restrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates. She has also appeared on "Shane and Friends", a video podcast hosted by Shane Dawson.
In February 2017, White was banned from social networking platform Facebook for 30 days, drawing complaints from her supporters. Her account was reinstated shortly afterwards, and Facebook said the ban was an error. That same year, White began uploading videos about her personal life, including about her gender affirming surgeries.
On November 11, 2017, White and her boyfriend filmed a video in which they wore hats bearing the Trump slogan "Make America Great Again" and attended an anti-Trump protest on Hollywood Boulevard. In the video, she claims to have been assaulted twice, and had a drink thrown in her face. Police say that White and her boyfriend began the altercation when they crossed a divider between pro- and anti-Trump protesters. White has said that she would not wear a red hat in an American liberal area again because of the confrontation.
Also in November 2017, White said that she was partly against Trump's transgender military ban.
In 2021, White said of the Super Straight trend that "The fact that people are upset about this new sexuality being created is a little hypocritical coming from the folks who created abrosexual, demisexual, gerontosexual, gynosexual, intrasexual, kalosexual, multisexual, pomosexual, sapiosexual, and literally hundreds more" and that "Even though super-straight is a joke, the irony is that it's a lot more valid than a lot of those I just listed. Actually, all of them."
Janae Marie Kroc controversy.
In October 2020, White received criticism and backlash following a video she posted about transgender athlete Janae Marie Kroc. White claimed that Kroc competes against cisgender women in powerlifting events and unfairly has won events as a result. Afterwards, Kroc responded on Instagram saying that "everything she said about me was incorrect". Kroc clarified that she has only ever competed before she transitioned, in the men's division, and that she has not competed and does not ever intend to compete against other women. On October 15, White apologized on Twitter and deleted the video from her YouTube channel.
Personal life.
As of 2017, White lives in Los Angeles. In 2017, she described her political beliefs as center-right. In 2019, White said that she is non-religious, stating that religion has had little significance in her life. White supported Donald Trump in the 2016 United States presidential election, but stated in 2018 that she remains critical of some of his policies and actions in office.
White is engaged to fellow YouTuber Joey Sarson.

Expresso Bongo (film)

Expresso Bongo is a 1959 film satire of the music industry directed by Val Guest, shot in uncredited black &amp; white Dyaliscope and starring Laurence Harvey, Cliff Richard, and Yolande Donlan. It is adapted from the stage musical of the same name, which was first produced on the stage at the Saville Theatre, London, on 23 April 1958.
In the film, Cliff Richard and the Shadows made their second screen appearance in a film released during 1959, the first being the much darker "Serious Charge". The later film was made at Shepperton Studios, near London, with certain scenes shot on location in London's Soho district.
Plot.
Laurence Harvey plays sleazy hustler Johnny Jackson, who is always on the lookout for fresh talent to exploit, while managing his hectic life with his stripper girlfriend, Maisie King. Maisie is looking to find a better life in singing.
Jackson discovers a teenage singer named Bert Rudge, played by Cliff Richard, in an espresso coffee shop and sets about sending him along the rocky road to fame. He changes his name to Bongo Herbert and soon gets him a record deal and a relationship with an ageing American singing sensation Dixie (Yolande Donlan).
Johnny gets a meeting with Mr Mayer of Garrick Records on Tin Pan Alley and gets Maisie to phone him there pretending to be HMV records, this prompts Mr Mayer into giving Bongo a contract.
However, Bongo soon realises that his 50/50 contract, which he naively agreed with Johnny, is not as great as he thought it was, and breaks from Johnny's contract with help from international star Dixie Collins (because Bongo is still legally a minor).
Production.
Director Val Guest engaged Kenneth MacMillan to choreograph the strip-club dancers who appear in the film. Struggling at Shepperton Studios to get them to dance and sing to playback at the same time, MacMillan complained, "It's the simplest routine. They may have looks, legs and tits, but they have no co-ordination."
At first, Laurence Harvey was undecided on the kind of accent he would give his character, so Guest told him he was 'part Soho, part Jewish, and part middle-class' and that it might be an idea to model him on the writer Wolf Mankowitz. Harvey arranged a couple of lunches with the unsuspecting Mankowitz to study the writer at close hand, so the character Johnny Jackson in the film sounds something like the writer of the film. Harvey's character sports a melange of accents including his own South African. Wolf Mankowitz appears in the film's opening credit sequence, wearing a sandwich-board bearing his writer credit.
Soundtrack album.
The music for the 1959 film was produced by Norrie Paramor. With the exception of one song, it was entirely different from the music that was used in the 1958 musical. The music and the plot were rewritten to downplay the satire and showcase Richard and his band. In the best ironic traditions of Tin Pan Alley, a satire became a tribute. Only "The Shrine on the Second Floor" — a song that was intended to drive a sharpened stake into the heart of all sentimental ballads about mother – made it into the movie, but Richard sang it straight.
Soundtrack EP.
In January 1960, an EP made up of all the Cliff Richard and the Shadows' tracks from the album was released. On the tenth of March, "Record Retailer" published the first UK EP Chart with "Expresso Bongo" topping the chart. Prior to this, the EP had also made the UK Singles Chart reaching number 14.
Reception.
According to Val Guest the film made "a lot of money and got us a lot of awards".
In a review for Radio Times, David Parkinson said that as well as being a fascinating snapshot of the era the film was also "one of the best musicals ever produced in this country." Laurence Harvey was "perfectly cast" as the talent agent and the script by Wolf Mankowitz was said to give the film an authentic quality. It was given a 4/5 rating.

Annie Gulvin

Annie M Gulvin (18 June 1876 - 1972) was one of the first two women gardeners at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.
Early life and education.
Annie Gulvin was born Mary Ann Gulvin in 1876, the daughter of Charles Gulvin, a police constable, and Mary Ann Hooker. She was one of the first female students at the previously all-male Swanley Horticultural College, and graduated top of her class. The Royal Horticultural Society published rankings of its examinees, and in 1895 Gulvin placed first and won their Silver Gilt Medal. 
Career.
In January 1896 Gulvin was appointed, with Alice Hutchins, by William Thiselton-Dyer, then Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens as the first women gardeners at Kew. 
Gulvin and Hutchins were then joined by Gertrude Cope and Eleanor Morland. The women were employed on equal pay, and were made to wear the same brown woolen uniform as male gardeners, so as not to distract their male colleagues. However, due to the publicity this caused, skirts were then reinstated. 
After a year working at Kew, Gulvin moved to the estate of Iscoed in Carmarthenshire, Wales in 1897 as head gardener. In 1899 Gulvin became head gardener in Burstall, Suffolk.
Personal life.
Gulvin married Alan Turner, a solicitor, in 1900, and ceased to practise as a gardener. She had a son and daughter, and died in 1972, aged 95.

Swedish Army Signal Troops

Swedish Army Signal Troops (, S) is the signal branch of the Swedish Army.
History.
The Swedish Army Signal Troops were organized in accordance with the Defence Act of 1936 as a special branch of the field telegraph troops which belonged to the "Fortifikationen". The signal troops consisted of the Signal Regiment (S 1) with the main part in Stockholm Garrison and a company in each of Kristianstad Garrison (S 1 K), Skövde Garrison (S 1 Sk) and Boden Garrison (S 1 B). From the signal troops, a large number of officers were also commanded for service in senior staffs.
Units, except regiments, battalions, corps and companies of the Swedish Army Signal Troops, included the Swedish Army Signal School ("Arméns signalskola", SignS) (1942–1965) which became the Swedish Army School of Staff Work and Communications ("Arméns stabs- och sambandsskola", StabSbS) (1965–1998) which in turn was part of the Swedish Army Staff and Communication Center ("Arméns lednings- och sambandscentrum", LSC) (1991–1997) along with the Army Staff's Signal Department ("Arméstabens signalavdelning") and ("Signaltruppernas officershögskola", SignOHS). The Swedish Army Signal Cadet and Officer Candidate School ("Signaltruppernas kadett- och aspirantskola", SignKAS) was active from 1961 to 1981 when it became a part of the Swedish Army School of Staff Work and Communications.
Today's signal troops mainly include staff and military communications units, and electronic warfare units. The Command and Control Regiment in Enköping has since 2007 taken over the previous tasks of the signal troops.
Inspector of the Swedish Army Signal Troops.
In the years 1966-1991, the signal and engineer troops had a joint branch inspector; the Inspector of the Swedish Army Engineer Corps and Signal Corps ("Ingenjörinspektör- och Signalinspektören"). From 1991, the two branches received an inspector each, and the title of the signal troops was shortened to the Signal Inspector. In connection with the decommissioning of Swedish Army Staff and Communication Center ("Arméns lednings- och sambandscentrum"), the position of Signal Inspector disappeared.

Schirrmacher is involved in leading dialogue initiatives (as of 2017) such as letters of response to the “Open Letter from 138 Muslim theologians to the leaders of Christian churches” (2007) and at the invitation of the Yale Center for Faith and Culture of Yale University also at the follow-up conference “Loving God and Neighbor in Word and Deed: Implications for Muslims and Christians” or the “Berlin Forum for Progressive Muslims” (2011; 2013), a symposium of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation. She has also served as an expert for the Human Rights and Humanitarian Aid Committee of the German Bundestag.
One of the findings of the Institute of Islamic Studies she heads (as of 2007) is that no Islamic country today grants Christians real religious freedom. Rather, they would be socially discriminated against and harassed in numerous states. Those who convert from Islam to Christianity are sometimes even threatened with death (see Apostasy in Islam). Europe is also facing new challenges in the age of globalisation and migration. This also includes the preservation of religious freedom as “a trademark of Europe” (Tom Königs) within the framework of the liberal-democratic basic order. However, anyone who fights against them cannot claim freedom of religion for this.

2018–19 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team

The 2018–19 Arizona Wildcats men's basketball team represented the University of Arizona during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team was led by 10th-year head coach Sean Miller and played their home games at McKale Center in Tucson, Arizona as members of the Pac-12 Conference. They finished the season 17–15, 8–10 in Pac-12 play to finish in three-way tie for 6th place. They received the 9-seed in the 2019 Pac-12 Tournament, where they lost to 8-seed USC in the first round, 65–78.
Previous season.
Entering the 2017–18 season, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against 10 people involved in college basketball, including Arizona assistant coach Emmanuel "Book" Richardson. The charges allege that Richardson and others allegedly received payments from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services and in turn used those payments to secure recruits. Following the news, Richardson was suspended and relieved of all duties. On January 11, 2018, UA fired assistant basketball coach Book Richardson after his appeal failed.
On February 23, 2018, according to a published report by ESPN, an FBI wiretap revealed that head coach Sean Miller talked with Christian Dawkins (another key figure in the scandal) to discuss paying their top prospect, Deandre Ayton, $100,000 to commit to Arizona, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly with him. While Miller would not coach their next game that day against Oregon, Arizona allowed Ayton to play. Coach Sean Miller subsequently denied the allegation and the University of Arizona announced he will remain the coach of Arizona Wildcats men’s basketball team, with Ayton also allowed to continue playing with the team for the rest of the season. However, as a consequence of the report involving Ayton, both of Arizona's remaining committed recruits from the class of 2018, Shareef O'Neal and Brandon Williams, announced they had decommitted.
During the season, Arizona defeated Texas A&amp;M in the Valley of the Sun Shootout in Phoenix, AZ. Arizona also defeated the same UMBC team that would go on to a historic upset of top-ranked Virginia in the NCAA tournament. Arizona lost to NC State, SMU and Purdue in the Battle 4 Atlantis in The Bahamas.
They finished the season 27–8, 14–4 in Pac-12 play to finish in a first place. The championship marked the school's 16th Pac-12 regular season championship title (back to back, 29th overall). As the No. 1 seed in the Pac-12 Tournament, Arizona defeated Colorado, UCLA (avenged from 82–74 loss on February 4 in Tucson, AZ) and USC to win the 2nd straight Pac-12 tournament championship title for the 7th time. As a result, the Wildcats received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament for the sixth consecutive year (35th NCAA tournament appearances). As a No. 4 seed in the South region, in the First round, they lost to No. 13 seed Buffalo 68–89.

National Archeologic Museum of Pontecagnano

The Pontecagnano National Archaeological Museum is a museum in Pontecagnano Faiano, in the province of Salerno, Italy that opened in 2007. Since December 2014, the museum has been managed by the Campania Museum Complex.
History.
The museum houses archaeological material found during the excavations of an ancient Villanovan settlement perhaps called "Amina" on which rose the ancient Picentia and the funerary assemblages of about 9,000 tombs of the necropolis discovered in the area, dating from 3000 BCE to the third century CE.
With the systematic excavation of the necropolis started by Bruno D'Agostino in 1962, a new chapter of the ancient history of Campania has opened. The vast necropolis, which, from the end of the 10th to the beginning of the 9th century BCE, was distributed around a large living space, are the most eloquent testimony of the expansion of Etruscan people in southern Italy in advance and then in conjunction with the process of Greek colonization of the coastal strip. The great center of Pontecagnano constitutes the most advanced point of that expansion and, at least since the end of the 6th century BCE had true urban characteristics. The considerable quantity of imported objects found in the funerary objects, both from the Greek and Near Eastern world and from the Greek and Italian ones, testify to its function as an emporion and its cultural richness.
The realization of the museum, which illustrates in a strictly scientific but at the same time suggestive and attractive, the evidence returned by the ancient settlement, comes from an intense and profitable collaboration between the Superintendence for Archaeological Heritage of the provinces of Salerno, Avellino and Benevento, the University of Naples "l'Orientale" and the University of Salerno. The Museum has been created for functional lots thanks to the funding assured in all these years by the Ministry for Cultural Assets and Activities and by the Campania region, while the Municipality of Pontecagnano has acquired the land on which the new building is located.
The museum itinerary opens with a section dedicated to Prehistory and the introductory panel summarizes, on the one hand, the stages of the evolution of prehistoric communities in the succession of different eras, on the other, the transformations of the landscape in the Piana del Sele.
The exhibition itinerary is organized chronologically in six sections:

Park ji-sung Road

Park Ji-sung Road or Dongtanjiseong-ro (동탄지성로) is a road located between Suwon and Hwaseong in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. Park Ji-sung Road is a six-lane road that runs from the front of Bethlehem Church in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province to Yeongtong-dong Road in Yeongtong-dong, Suwon. The road is named after Park Ji-sung, and it was created after the 2002 World Cup match against Portugal when he scored the decisive goal for Park's advance to the round of 16 and was promised by Gyeonggi Province Governor Sohn Hak-kyu, who visited Park's house in Suwon. It was opened in 2005, attended by Park. In 2009 the road was renamed Dongtanjiseong-ro, with the name of Dongtan New Town added to the name of the road.
On the 86 meter-long soundproof walls that are installed in front of the Jamsa Insector Research Center in the middle of the road, 10 large photos of Park's World Cup matches and goals are displayed. Park Ji-sung Forest, a 297.5 m2 forest, was also created near the National Seed Management Center next to the road.
Park ji-sung Football Center.
Park ji-sung Football center is located right next to Park Ji-sung Road. To get to Park Ji-sung Football Center, one can only go via Park Ji-sung Road. The Park Ji-sung Soccer Center (Ji-Sung Football Center, JSFC) is a football center that enables Korean soccer player Park Ji-sung to foster growth and development of youth soccer training facilities in the Republic of Korea, and to utilize his training facilities for training in various sports. The construction began on October 6, 2009 with a groundbreaking ceremony for the seed management office site of the Korea Agricultural Technology Institute in Gyeonggi Province, 10,5658 square meters 2, and held a completion ceremony on July 24, 2010.
Maintenance issue.
Ten years after the opening of Park Ji-Sung Road, the road became neglected due to the lack of management and indifference of the local governments. In 2009, a section of road (3.4㎞) in Hwaseong City was included in a reorganisation and the name of the road was changed to Dongtanjiseong-ro, and the management responsibility for the road between different local governments became unclear. As a result, maintenance work was not done on time, and the management of roads and facilities is left in a state of disarray. The road signboard placed at the entrance to the Shin-dong trunk road in Suwon was left untouched for months after the explanatory text was damaged.

Early life and education.
The son of a merchant from Gilan who had taken part in the Constitutional Revolution, Keshavarz studied in "Dar ul-Funun" before going to study medicine in France. He taught at University of Tehran after he returned to Iran.
Career.
Keshavarz entered politics in 1941, and joined Tudeh Party of Iran three months after its creation. A leading member of the party, he was elected to its first central committee and served as the party's parliamentary spokesperson. In the summer of 1946 he was named a minister in Qavam's coalition cabinet. He broke away from the party in 1958, because he came to believe that "Tudeh's policy is a betrayal of the working class".

Show Grounds Greyhound Track

The Show Grounds Greyhound Track was a greyhound racing track in Ballintemple, Cork.
Origins.
This track was the first provincial greyhound racing venue to be built in Ireland and the third behind Celtic Park and Shelbourne Park.
The track was constructed by the Southern Greyhound and Sports Company Limited, in part of the 27 acres known as Lower Park, which was owned by the Cork Agricultural Buildings Co Ltd. Lower Park was used by the County Cork Agricultural Society and ran from the present-day Centre Park Road to Blackrock. The society later became the Munster Agricultural Society, and buildings were constructed in .
Opening.
In early 1928, the new stadium took shape; the construction was simple because there was already much in place such as the jumping enclosure where spectators viewed the show jumping from previous shows. There was accommodation for 20,000 people, car parking was for 1,000 cars and the kennels were listed as exhibition kennels allowing the public to view them. There was a tram service to Ballintemple and there were three price bands for the three areas of the grandstand, the 'special enclosure' and the 'popular enclosure'.
The secretary of the Irish Coursing Club (ICC) and a representative from the Greyhound Racing Control Board visited the facilities and gave the green light by issuing a licence under ICC rules. The racing started on Wednesday 27 June 1928 and events were held over 525 and 550 yards. 
Closure.
The choice of venue had been constantly criticised by the press due to the fact that it was too far east and outside of the city, which ultimately led to closure on 20 September 1935 because a new venue was being constructed. The new venue was called the Cork Greyhound Stadium and was on Western Road which allowed the Cork public easier access.

Elver pass

An elver pass or eel pass is a waterway modification constructed to mitigate the effects of obstructions, especially manmade weirs, on waterways, watercourses, ditches, drains, channels and flumes, on the movement of eels, fish and elvers (juvenile eels). Powerful swimmers, including salmon and sea trout, find it easy to pass through many structures. However, it is widely accepted that some structures make fish migration more difficult upstream.
Construction.
The UK Environment Agency has guidelines for the design of eel and elver passes for employment in weirs, tidal flaps &amp; gates and sluice structures. A variety of materials for example HDPE and stainless steel are used to construct brush and bristle surfaces, pipes, ducts, mouse holes, cat flaps and pet door types of eel and elver passes.
Eel and elver passes are distinctive from fish ladders which in turn are distinct from eel ladders. The eel ladder is constructed by introducing steps or uprights. Each step or upright of the eel ladder interrupts the flow of water at each point in the ladder. In contrast, eel and elver passes are distinct by either employing a tube which bypasses the main flow or current and/or employing a bristle surface that presents a greater length of continuous disruption to the flow of water.
Migration and measurement.
Eel and elver passes have a dual purpose. By separating the eel traffic in the flow of water more accurate measurement of eel and elver migration is made possible. The results also prove the benefits. Wisbech Standard 12 July 2014 report large numbers of eels return to the Fens also being able to migrate into the Middle Level along a bristle and duct type eel and elver pass.
Regulations.
The Eels (England and Wales) Regulations 2009 implement Council Regulation (EC) No 1100/2007 of the Council of the European Union, establishing measures for the recovery of the stock of European eel.
Some requirements of the regulations are, where appropriate, to:

RAF Cark

Royal Air Force Cark or more simply RAF Cark is a former Royal Air Force station in the county of Cumbria (formerly Lancashire) which was operational between 1941 and 1945. It was built near the villages of Cark and Flookburgh on the Cartmel Peninsula which today forms part of Cumbria.
History.
Construction.
RAF Cark was constructed on a site which had been considered for a possible airship factory in 1916. Preparation work had been undertaken however the project was cancelled the following year.
Operational life.
Opening in 1941, the station was designed primarily to operate as a fighter station under the control of RAF Fighter Command in order to afford protection to the industrialised areas of northwest England.
The airfield featured a dispersal site on the east side which consisted of six pens each able to accommodate two aircraft. On the northwest side of the airfield a Bellman Hangar was built on the technical site and in time this was supplemented by the addition of fourteen blister type hangars.
Once the threat of invasion had receded, the airfield was used by RAF Flying Training Command as a Staff Pilot Training Unit and for Anti Aircraft gunnery training with aircraft such as Hawker Hurricanes, Miles Martinets and latterly Supermarine Spitfires.
Initially parented by RAF Millom, RAF Cark became a self reliant station during 1942. The Staff Pilot Training Unit left in November 1942, but returned the following March. In 1944 gliders of the requisitioned Lakes Gliding Club were moved from RAF Walney and formed No. 188 Gliding School, Air Training Corps.
During its operational life RAF Cark played host to detachments from several squadrons on anti aircraft co-operational duties.
Units.
During the course of the operation of the station, the following units were at sometime based at RAF Cark:
03/41 to 11/42, Staff Pilot Training Unit RAF.
01/42 to 10/42, No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF ('R'.Flt).
01/42 to 11/42, No. 1 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF ('F'.Flt).
03/42 to 03/43, No. 6 Anti-Aircraft Co-operation Unit RAF
11/42 to 12/43, No. 1614 (Anti-Aircraft Co-operation) Flight RAF.
11/42 to --/--, No. 289 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Hawker Hurricanes.
03/43 to 12/45, Staff Pilot Training Unit.
03/43 to 11/44, No. 650 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Miles Martinets.
04/44 to 05/44, No. 290 Squadron RAF (detachment) with Supermarine Spitfires
11/44 to --/--, 650 Sqn (detachment) with Hawker Hurricanes.
10/45 to 12/45, Pilot-Navigation Instructors Course RAF
--/44 to 05/47, No. 188 Gliding School, Air Training Corps.
Closure.
Following the cessation of hostilities in 1945 operations at RAF Cark were run down with the station being placed on care and maintenance. The last residents to leave were No. 188 Gliding School who transferred to RAF Walney in May 1947 following which the Station closed.
Subsequent use.
RAF Cark was sold off by the Air Ministry and was subsequently used as a venue for gliding. Today, Cark Airfield is the home of the North West Parachute Centre.

Lucienne Jourfier

Lucienne Jourfier (17 September 1923 in Toulouse - 10 January 2017 in Paris) was a 20th-century French operatic coloratura soprano.
Biography.
Her father, Gaston Jourfier, a renowned painter and professor at the city's Fine Arts School, was already creating sets for the Théâtre du Capitole de Toulouse. Her aunt, Miss Germaine Bailac of the Paris Opera, was in her day a celebrated singer in Paris: she had begun at the Opera in 1907 in the role of Delilah, and was later a much sought-after Carmen.
Jourfier approached music by entering the conservatory of her hometown in the viola class. It was at the age of 19, when she was working as an accompanist in the singing class, that she made a name for herself and joined the same singing class at the Toulouse Conservatory. She obtained her first prizes unanimously from the jury in June 1943, already being noticed by the directors of the lyrical theatres present, including that of the Capitol, who offered to hire her in his troupe.
She nevertheless insisted on obtaining her prizes in Paris, and entered the Conservatoire de la Ville de Paris a few months later in March 1945, in the class of Paul Guillamat, the father of singer Ginette Guillamat. She won her first prizes, again unanimously, in June 1945, just six months after she had entered the singing class at the Conservatoire de Paris. She sang the same aria as during the entrance contest, the "Scene of Madness" of "Lucia di Lammermoor", with variations of Lily Pons. It is on the occasion of the contest for the students of this singing class that the composer and conductor Reynaldo Hahn noticed this 21-year-old girl, and hired her to begin on the prestigious stage of the Palais Garnier the following August during the revival of Mozart's 
"The Magic Flute", in which she had Mado Robin, Paul Cabanel and Henri Médus as partners. Thus Jourfier made her debut at the Paris Opera on 10 August 1945 in the role of Pamina, aged 21. She remains to this day the youngest singer of the Paris opera.
Also in 1945, Jourfier made her debut at the Salle Favart in the role of Sophie in "Werther". Subsequently, she sang Leila of "Les Pêcheurs de perles", Philine of "Mignon", Violetta of "La Traviata", Micaela of "Carmen", Suzanne of "The Marriage of Figaro", La Guimard of Gabriel Pierné's "Fragonard" (with Fanély Revoil and Jacques Jansen), Mimi of "La Bohème", Messager's "Monsieur Beaucaire" which she sang with Jacques Jansen, Rosina of "The Barber of Seville"... She was chosen to play this Rosina on screen when it was decided to produce a film production of Rossini's opera in 1948 under the musical direction of conductor André Cluytens. Jourfier responded there to Raymond Amade, Roger Bourdin and Roger Bussonnet.
At the palais Garnier, besides Pamina, she was Gounod's Juliette (1947), and it was to her that Maurice Lehmann entrusted the task of resurrecting "Amour" of Rameau's "Les Indes galantes" in the 1952 revival with Géori Boué, Denise Duval, Janine Micheau and Jacqueline Brumaire.
She also played in Massenet's "Manon", which was the role in which she left a great memory.
The young woman announced that she was leaving the Paris Opera in 1953. Maurice Lehmann continued to consider her a full member of his troupe. But nothing did: Lucienne Jourfier continued to perform live, less and less often, and gave up her career definitively in 1956, at the age of 32.
Being bound by an exclusive contract with the Paris Opera, Jourfier could only exceptionally participate in recording sessions. She nevertheless leaves a handful of discs, among which are the main arias of Massenet's "Manon". For the same reasons, her career in the provinces and abroad was rather limited, the artists under contract with the Opera at the time having the possibility to perform on other stages only during their holidays (i.e. in July in early August). Jourfier was nevertheless able to meet audiences in North Africa and Geneva; but it was in Monte-Carlo that she represented the Paris Opera and the French singing school, particularly during the 1952 season. Raoul Gunsbourg, then director of the Monte-Carlo Opera asked her to come and sing in 'his' "house of the Bohemians", a performance which moved both the public, and the princely family, and her partner, the great tenor Giacomo Lauri-Volpi. 
There are a very large number of radio recordings of this singer in the Institut national de l'audiovisuel archives.
Lucienne Jourfier died in Paris at age 92.

Free Sicilians

Free Sicilians (; ; SL) is a Sicilian nationalist and pro-independence political party in Sicily, Italy. The party was founded in 2016 in order to revive the island's right to self-government.
History.
Free Sicilians was founded by Massimo Costa, Antonella Pititto and Enzo Cassata. The party was launched on 3 January 2016 during a meeting in Pergusa. On the same occasion, the economist Massimo Costa, professor at the University of Palermo, became president of the party.
Free Sicilians took part in the local elections for the first time in the spring of 2017, presenting its own mayoral candidate and its own electoral list in Palermo, capital of Sicily. Ciro Lomonte, an architect and scholar of the Salingaros Group, was chosen as mayoral candidate. During his electoral campaign, Lomonte focused on the issues of the urban renewal, the identity revival of Palermo and the violations of the Statute of Sicily by the Italian Government. Lomonte gained 4787 votes (1,76%), while the list gained 4041 votes (1,71%).
Roberto La Rosa, a lawyer and former deputy secretary of the "Sicilian National Front", was chosen as presidential candidate for the 2017 regional election. Free Sicilians was the only pro-independence party competing for the Sicilian Regional Assembly in 2017. "Economic independence" was the key concept of the electoral campaign. According to the party's program, this key concept would be pursued through the adoption of the special economic zone and a complementary currency called "Tarì", like the ancient coin of the Kingdom of Sicily. During the campaign, La Rosa also suggested the creation of the Sicilian national football team as other autonomous regions and unrecognised states did before Sicily. La Rosa gained 14,656 votes (0.70%), while the list gained 12,600 votes (0.66%).
On December 2017 Ciro Lomonte was chosen as provisional secretary until the first Congress of the party.
Ideology.
Free Sicilians believes that Sicily is a European stateless nation with its own political history, language, culture, traditions and national identity. The party describes the current political and economic condition of Sicily as a case of internal colonialism. In particular, Free Sicilians complains the persistent non-implementation of the Autonomous Statute of Sicily and, for this reason, aims to gradually achieve the full independence of the island in order to create a sovereign state. The party describes its ideology as "souverainist", in opposition to the excesses of globalization.
International relations.
The responsible for the international relations of Free Sicilians is Francesco Marsala, president of the cultural association "Sicilia-Catalunya", who attended as international observer during the 2017 Catalan independence referendum. On February and March 2018, Free Sicilians hosted the first delegations of Catalan nationalist parties ("Estat Català", "Esquerra Republicana") at its headquarters in Palermo.
On December 2017 Free Sicilians has congratulated the Corsican nationalist alliance "Pè a Corsica" for the success in the Corsican territorial election.
In 2018 and 2019, the party entered in dialogue and collaboration with many other similar movements, in other territories of the Italian Republic and European Union, namely Comitato Libertà Toscana (Committee Liberty Tuscany), along with Patto per l'Autonomia (Pact for Self-government) and Patrie Furlane (Friulian Home), which are active in Friuli-Venetia Giulia region.

Ethel Armstrong

Ethel Armstrong (born 1930) is a British radiographer. She began working for the National Health Service (NHS) on the day it was established, 5 July 1948, and subsequently played a key role in establishing the NHS Retirement Fellowship.
Early life and education.
Ethel Armstrong was born in Durham in 1930. She attended school until the age of 17, then her headmaster recommended that she get a job rather than continue in the sixth form. She was unable to attend university as there were no grants for women to study dentistry or medicine.
Career.
On leaving school, Armstrong worked at a large mental health hospital in Newcastle as a "cadet" where she experienced several different departments. Once she was 18 she was able to join the school of radio diagnosis, on the same day as the birth of the NHS: 5 July 1948.
She primarily worked in radiography and radiotherapy from this point forward. Armstrong worked with John Charnley during his early work on hip operations, before he received his knighthood.
Armstrong worked as a tutor and advisor to the Liverpool Breast Screening Service until 1989, when she retired. At the time that she worked for the service, it was an experimental unit and only adopted across the NHS in the 1980s.
During the course of her work, Armstrong earned a master's degree in clinical practice (oncology).
Voluntary work.
After retirement, Armstrong returned to Durham and continued her work for the NHS by volunteering for the Durham branch of the NHS Retirement Fellowship. She served as chairman from 1994 to the present. From 2005, she became part of the National Council, and was elected vice chairman in 2009, then chairman in 2011 and president in 2013. Having been involved with the service for so long, Armstrong was invited to become the Retirement Fellowship's first Life Patron in 2015.
She is also an active member of the Cavell Nurses' Trust. Because of her long career and continued charity work, Armstrong made a guest appearance alongside Simon Stevens, the NHS chief executive, at the Health and Care Innovation Expo 2017.
In March 2018, Armstrong received an MBE for her seven decades of service to the NHS. On receiving the award, Armstrong stated:The NHS is part of who I am, and I have been proud and lucky enough to have been there at the start of this wonderful institution. It's a particular honour to receive this in the year that the NHS turns 70 and I see this as a nod to all the special people I've had the privilege of working for over the decades. However, she noted that when the NHS turns 70 it would also be her 70th anniversary, and perhaps time to retire fully.
Personal life.
Ethel Armstrong was married to husband Harry until his death in 1998. He worked for Hawker Siddeley as a director, which required regular moves around the United Kingdom and led Ethel to work for many different NHS trusts.

Wendell Holland

Wendell F. Holland Jr. (born March 8, 1984) is an American furniture company owner best known for competing on the American reality show "Survivor". On May 23, 2018, he was revealed as the winner of the show's 36th season, "". He returned for the show's 40th season Survivor: Winners At War, where he was eliminated in 13th place. Since 2020, he has been a co-host on HGTV’s Hot Mess House.
Early life.
Holland grew up in Ardmore, Pennsylvania and graduated from Harriton High School. He attended Morehouse College, where he graduated phi beta kappa, and University of Pennsylvania Law School, where he became a lawyer. After selling several home-made beds on Craigslist, he ultimately left his law practice and founded Beve Unlimited, a furniture company in Philadelphia.
"Survivor".
"Ghost Island".
In 2018, Holland participated in ', the 36th season of "Survivor". He started on the Naviti tribe where he aligned with Domenick Abbate. Following the first tribe switch, he remained on Naviti along with original Naviti's Abbate, Chris Noble, Morgan Ricke and Angela Perkins. Following Naviti's next immunity challenge loss, Holland and Abbate tried to target Perkins after Noble was sent to Ghost Island, but Ricke was blindsided at Tribal Council, shocking Holland and Abbate. Despite appearing to be on the bottom, Holland stayed in the game after Naviti won the next two challenges. Following the second switch, he was sent to Yanuya where he found Erik Reichenbach's immunity necklace from ', which was now a hidden immunity idol. Yanuya won the remaining challenges, allowing him to make it to the merge.
Shortly after the merge, Holland and Abbate formed a secret Final Four alliance with original Malolo members Donathan Hurley and Laurel Johnson. At the Final Eight, he was targeted by the female members from the original Naviti tribe, but managed to escape elimination. At the Final Five, he used Reichenbach's necklace on Johnson, but it was unneeded as Hurley was unanimously voted out. When Abbate won the final immunity challenge, he saved Johnson which required Holland and Perkins to compete in a fire-making challenge. Holland defeated Perkins which earned him a spot at the Final Tribal Council.
During the Final Tribal Council, he was respected for his more relaxed social game, but jury members wondered what he did throughout the game. Both Holland and Abbate ended up tying with five jury votes each, making it the first time in Survivor history where the jury vote ended in a tie. With Abbate and him tied, Johnson, who finished third, became the last jury member and cast the winning vote which left him and Abbate at the mercy of Johnson. On May 23, 2018, Probst revealed that Johnson voted for Holland, thus making him the Sole Survivor.
"Winners at War".
Holland returned as a contestant on the show's 40th season, "". Starting on the Dakal tribe, Holland faced two tribal councils, but received no votes. After being switched to the Sele tribe following the Tribe Swap, he was reunited with his ex-girlfriend Michele Fitzgerald, though they were not on good terms, and Holland acted distant and rude to her. While receiving votes in the next two tribal councils, he survived elimination, thanks to his alliance with fellow Dakal Nick Wilson, and ability to settle his differences with Fitzgerald. He reached the merge, but was blindsided at the merged tribal council, due to Sophie Clarke feeling like he was too close to Jeremy Collins. He was eliminated in 13th place on day 35 after losing the second and final Edge of Extinction challenge. As a member of the jury, Holland cast his vote for eventual sole Survivor and two time winner Tony Vlachos.
Awards &amp; Nominations.
Holland competed in the HGTV reality show Beach Cabana Royale, where he was eliminated in last place.
Personal.
Holland is the son of Wendell Foster Holland Sr. (born February 10, 1952), an attorney educated at Fordham University and the Rutgers Law School. He is of Guyanese descent from his maternal grandfather, Darson.

Haandarbejdets Fremme

Haandarbejdets Fremme, known in English as the Danish Handcraft Guild, was established on 20 March 1928 to promote Danish textile art and provide support to all those working with embroidery. This was achieved by arranging exhibitions, lectures and courses, by coordinating purchasing and marketing opportunities, and by publishing design guides including "Årets Korssting", the annual cross-stitch calendar. For over 70 years, the guild has provided access to cross-stitch kits and designs, many of which were created by the artists Gerda Bengtsson, Ida Winckler and Mads Stage.
History.
Thanks mainly to initiatives taken by Gertie Wandel who was active until she retired as president in 1978, the society developed into an effective organization with its own workshop, and a network of retail outlets and training facilities across Denmark. From the beginning, it enjoyed the support of the royal family, including Queen Alexandrine and Queen Ingrid. Queen Alexandrine attended a Haandarbejdets Fremme exhibition in 1939 while Queen Margrethe, who has contributed many embroidery designs to the organization, together with Crown Princess Mary, attended the 90th-anniversary celebrations on 20 March 2018 in Greve Museum.
A considerable number of artists have contributed to the organization over the years. The major contributors have been Gerda Bengtsson, Ida Wincklet and Edith Hansen who have all worked on the premises and presented training courses. Others include Mogens Koch, Dagmar Starcke, Ann-Mari Kornerup, Naja Salto and Mads Stage, the weavers Gerda Henning, Vibeke Klint, Lis Ahlmann and Kim Naver, the textile printers Gudrun Stig Aagaard and Marie Gudme Leth, as well as the painter and ceramist Bjørn Wiinblad.

Palma was born in Liverpool to an Irish mother and Nigerian father, the only girl among her mother's six children by various men. She grew up in her mother's native Portadown, County Armagh in a staunchly Protestant family. Her parents separated when she was four; she never saw her father, who died just two years later, again. Palma was regularly bullied at school because of her mixed race, while her alcoholic mother frequently neglected her children.
She moved to London in 1986 and became a qualified social worker with a Diploma in Social Work and a BSc in Applied Social Science. She later believed that had she not left Northern Ireland, she might have contemplated suicide. Palma has worked with several children's centres and helped improve their child protection services. She has criticised the government's austerity cuts against public services, believing they would leave child protection services with too much work.
Writing.
Palma has published several collections of poetry and an autobiography, "For the Love of a Mother: The Black Children of Ulster". The book documents her growing up in the 1960s and 1970s, and how her black family coped with the sectarianism and violence at that time.

St Germanus' Church, Faulkbourne

St Germanus' Church is an active Church of England church in the village of Faulkbourne in Essex, England. Much of the existing church dates to the 12th and 13th centuries. It has been Grade I listed since 1967.
The church is dedicated to Saint Germanus, a bishop of Auxerre in Late Antique Gaul, who visited Britain to suppress the Pelagian heresy in about 429. The church may have been dedicated to Saint Germanus because it was consecrated on his feast day, 31 July.
History.
The original Norman church, dating from the 12th century, was extended in the 13th century and restored in the 19th century. Its walls are constructed mainly of flint rubble and Roman brick, with red clay tiles on the roof. It has a timber-framed bell turret and spire, with a red brick porch and vestry, both attached to the south wall.
In 1886, the church was restored by the architect Arthur Blomfield at a cost of £800. A service was held on 21 October 1886 to mark the reopening of the church following its restoration, with the sermon delivered by the Rt. Rev. Thomas Legh Claughton, Bishop of St Albans.
The church contains a number of memorials to the Bullock family, who owned Faulkbourne Hall from 1637 to 1897.

Steven D. Stark

Steven D. Stark (born November 21, 1951) is an American author and educator, specializing in the areas of cultural commentary and U.S. law. He has worked as the cultural commentator for CNN, National Public Radio (NPR), and Voice of America, and written regularly for publications such as "The New York Times", the "Los Angeles Times", and "The Atlantic". He has also contributed to "The World", a radio program co-produced by the BBC World Service and WGBH.
Stark is the author of four books, including "Glued to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We Are Today" (1997), "Writing to Win: The Legal Writer" (1999), and "Meet the Beatles: A Cultural History of the Band That Shook Youth, Gender, and the World" (2005).
Early life and career.
Stark grew up in Washington, D.C. and attended Sidwell Friends School. His father, William, was a psychiatrist, and his mother, Vivianne, was a professor of English at Montgomery College. He graduated from Harvard College and Yale Law School. By 1979, he was employed as a law clerk to Judge Elbert P. Tuttle of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Atlanta.
In 1976, he served as an "issues director" on Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign and came to appreciate the political significance of the rise in contemporary Southern culture. According to Ralph Whitehead, a professor of journalism at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, this experience encouraged Stark to develop "the American-studies view of politics: that what happens in politics is often an expression of deeper cultural and psychological forces that are at work in the country."&lt;ref name="Aucoin/BostonGlobe"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to writing for "The Boston Phoenix", Stark contributed as an op-ed columnist to "The Boston Globe" and wrote a column on international sport for the "Montreal Gazette".
On his website, Stark's former role as an NPR broadcaster is described as his attempt to "interpret American culture to the rest of the world". Stark's first book, "Glued to the Set: The 60 Television Shows and Events That Made Us Who We Are Today", was published in 1997.
In 1999, Doubleday published Stark's book "Writing to Win: The Legal Writer", in which he espoused an approach in legal correspondence and in the courtroom of brevity and simplicity. Among the endorsements for the book, Laurence Tribe described it as an "invaluable" work that would benefit students and most practicing lawyers alike.
Stark's book "Meet the Beatles: A Cultural History of the Band That Shook Youth, Gender, and the World" was published in 2005 by HarperCollins. Three years before its publication, he moved to Chester, near Liverpool, in the north of England, to carry out research into the Beatles phenomenon.
"Kirkus Reviews" said that "Meet the Beatles" offered little insight on the band that had not been unearthed by previous studies into their international impact. By contrast, James Rosen of "The Washington Post" appreciated the author's focus on how the Beatles' feminine qualities were a key factor in the group's appeal, and said the book was a "thoughtful, provocative and ultimately valuable contribution to the literature of the Beatles". Don Aucoin wrote in "The Boston Globe" that in analysing the band's impact, "[Stark] captures also the sheer waves of joy the Beatles sent through the world, how they transformed youth culture, legitimized rock 'n' roll as an art form, and hastened the globalization of business and communications." "Publishers Weekly" said: "A thorough biography of the band ... Stark is sharp and insightful."
Stark has lectured in law at Harvard Law School. He has also published fiction, poetry in the chapbook format, and exhibited as an artist. He currently lives in Boston, Massachusetts and works as a consultant to the legal and other professions, teaching courses on speaking and writing. He married Sarah Wald, also a lawyer and academic, in October 1979,&lt;ref name="Snark wedding/NYT"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the couple have two sons.

Petrol Girls

Petrol Girls is an English punk rock band formed in London in 2012 by Ren Aldridge and Liepa Kuraitė, with Joe York and Zock Astpai joining later. The band is named after the historical Pétroleuses and is outspokenly feminist. They have received media coverage from The Independent, Kerrang!, NPR and Vice Media
History.
Petrol Girls formed and played their first show in 2012, after just two practises, at a house party hosted by founding member Ren Aldridge (vocals) to celebrate International Women’s Day. Retaining original bassist Liepa Kuraitė, who had never played before Aldridge invited her to join, they eventually recruited Joe York (guitar) and Zock Astpai (drums) to complete a sustainable lineup.
Aldridge took the name from a group of 19th century French revolutionaries, "les Pétroleuses", after hearing them mentioned by Laurie Penny.
After two EPs, their eponymous self released 7" from 2014 and "Some Thing" from 2016, the band released their debut album "Talk of Violence" on Bomber Music in 2017.
In April 2018 the band released single "Survivor" and announced they had signed to Hassle Records for their next release - EP "The Future Is Dark" released on 14 September.
Their second full length album "Cut &amp; Stitch" was released on 24 May 2019. It received positive reviews from NPR, The Skinny, and Kerrang! - who in June also called it 'one of the best albums of the year so far'.
In July 2019 it emerged that Aldridge is one of several musicians being sued by singer/rapper Jonny "Itch" Fox, seeking aggravated damages and an injunction for alleged libel. The defendants are fundraising towards their legal costs.
On 6 November 2019 Kuraitė posted a statement on Facebook stating she was going to leave the band by the end of the year.

The Antiphon

"The Antiphon" (1958) is a three-act verse tragedy by Djuna Barnes. Set in England in 1939 after the beginning of World War Two, the drama presents the Hobbs family reunion in the family's ancestral home, Burley Hall. The play features many of the themes or motifs that run through Barnes's work, including betrayal, familial relations, regression and transgression. The dialogue is highly stylized and poetic.
The play premiered in 1961 in Stockholm in a Swedish translation by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld. Despite the fact that Barnes continued to write until her death in 1983, it was the last of her major works to be published. Although it was not as successful as "Nightwood", Barnes considered it her most important work.
Synopsis.
The play tells the story of the reunion of Augusta Hobbs, her brother, Jonathan Burley, and her four estranged adult children: Dudley, Elisha, Miranda and Jeremy. The play begins with the arrival at Burley Hall of Miranda, a 'tall woman in her late fifties', and a coachman, Jack Blow, that she has met in Dover during her journey to England from France. She reveals that, along with her sibling, uncle and mother, she has been summoned by her youngest brother Jeremy to the family's ancestral home. However, Jeremy is nowhere to be found upon their arrival. The building has not been occupied for some time and is in a state of dilapidation thanks to German bombing campaigns; the house's former contents are sprawled all over the set.
Miranda is shortly joined by her uncle, Jonathan Burley, as well as her two brothers, Dudley, a manufacturer of watches and Elisha, a publicist, and later by her mother, Augusta.
As they wait for Jeremy, they discuss family history and air old grievances, many of them about the family's deceased patriarch, Titus Hobbs. Dudley and Elisha exhibit a strong dislike for Miranda and their mother, playing a number of increasingly cruel and violent tricks upon them. Miranda starts to suspect that the invitation might have been a trap set by Dudley and Elisha to lure them to the home and murder them. Augusta, however, remains oblivious to her sons' behavior. Miranda and Augusta argue, with Miranda suggesting that just as Augusta was blind to the sexual and physical abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, she is also blind to the murderous intent that her sons present towards her.
The final act begins with all the characters asleep on stage. Jeremy has still not arrived. Augusta, unable to sleep, begins to playact as if she was a young woman once again and that the traumatic events she has lived through have not happened. Miranda silently watches with horror and empathy. She tries to warn Augusta again of the violent dangers posed by Dudley and Elisha. However, Augusta, believing Miranda to be betraying her own family, smashes her skull with a curfew bell and kills her. Jack then reveals that he is, in fact, Jeremy and that he invited them to the house with the intent that the family would implode as they have. When he is asked why he did it by his uncle, he responds that 'This is the hour of the uncreate; | The season of the sorrowless lamenting'. The play ends with Jonathan Burley watching his nephew, Jeremy, silently and 'with what appears to be indifference' leave the stage.
Publication History.
Barnes started writing the play in the early 1950s, and unlike her other major works, many of the early manuscript drafts still exist. They can be consulted in her archives at The University of Maryland. In 1954, once Barnes had completed writing the play, she sent it to T.S. Eliot at Faber &amp; Faber, who previously published "Nightwood" and with whom she had developed a strong friendship. Eliot was initially uncertain of the play's merits, indeed in a letter responding to it he explained that he had struggled to fully comprehend it. Nonetheless, he enlisted the poet and critic Edwin Muir to read the manuscript, who claimed the play "a work of genius and utterly absurd." Muir did, however, suggest some editorial changes, especially to the first act, and Barnes produced a new draft of the play. In November 1956, with Muir and Eliot's recommendation, Faber &amp; Faber agreed to publish the play, and Eliot agreed to write the preface for it as he had done for Nightwood. However, the draft preface he sent to Barnes ahead of the publication described the play as quixotic and Barnes as a writer with too much genius and not enough talent. Barnes was hurt, and Eliot withdrew the preface, but their friendship had been soured.
The editing process was extensive and intensive, with Eliot's working closely with Barnes on numerous drafts. Robert Giroux, her American publisher, recalled being sent 1,500 manuscript sheets from Faber &amp; Faber when they published the play in the U.S.
Performances.
In 1956, Edwin Muir organised for the New York Poets Theatre to give a reading performance of an early draft of the play at Harvard Yard. Muir, Eliot and Barnes were present as well as a number of other literary figures, including Robert Lowell. In his biography of Barnes, Phillip Herring suggests that the performance was so bad that "Eliot's head sank into his hand; Muir became rigid [and] Barnes was furious".
The play received its first public performance in 1962 in Stockholm. It was translated into Swedish by Karl Ragnar Gierow and U.N. Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld, the latter of whom Barnes became close friends. The play was directed by Gierow.
The Swedish performance remains the only major production of "The Antiphon", and indeed, perhaps the only public performance of the play. Barnes's correspondence in her archive at the University of Maryland reveals that she often was contacted with requests to stage the play, but she invariably turned them down.
Critical Reception.
In "The New York Times Book Review", Dudley Fitts described the Antiphon as "dramatic poetry of a curious and high order' and highlighted that the pleasure of the play was to be found in 'the pleasure of language. Not spoken language; Miss Barnes has no ear for the stage, but the intricate, rich, almost viciously brilliant discourse, modeled more or less on the murkier post-Elizabethans." In the "Times Literary Supplement", the anonymous reviewer suggested that "[t]here will always be one or two eccentrics who think 'The Antiphon' gives its author first place among women who have written verse in the English language."
In recent years, the play has been re-examined by literary critics. Daniela Casselli has argued that the play is an important work of modernist drama and 'stages the moment when drama collapses'.
The play was translated in French and set at the Odeon Theater in Paris by the “Comedie Française” in March 1990.

Atatürk Teacher Training Academy

Atatürk Teacher Training Academy () is a higher education institution in Nicosia, North Cyprus. The academy was founded in 1937 by the ruling British government in Cyprus as the Morphou Teacher Training College. It is accredited as a university by YÖK, the Council of Higher Education of Turkey, and YÖDAK, The Higher Education Planning, Evaluation, Accreditation and Coordination Council of Northern Cyprus. Atatürk Teacher Training Academy is the oldest active higher education institution in Cyprus.
History.
Morphou Teacher Training College (Omorfo Öğretmen Koleji) was established as a two-year institution by the ruling British, offering teacher training in English both for Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypiots, with graduates qualifying as primary teachers, in 1937. The college was not popular amongst the Orthodox Church since they preferred to handle the education of Greek Cypriot teachers by themselves. In 1943, a new institution was formed to train Greek Cypriot women, however Turkish Cypriot women were also admitted after 1948. Following the intercommunal violence in 1958, Greek Cypriots withdrew from the institution and moved into a new college in Nicosia, the Teacher Training College.
British government moved the Morphou Teacher Training College to Terra Santa, Strovolos in Nicosia and named it as the Turkish Teacher Training College (Türk Öğretmen Koleji) in 1958. The school later moved to the Turkish Cypriot quarters of Nicosia in 1969. The school moved to Kyrenia in 1974, Kuchuk Kaimakli in 1990, and Yeni Jami in 1994 before settling down to its current location in Dumlupınar, Kuchuk Kaimakli in 1999. The Assembly of the Republic passed a new law in 2000, giving it an academy status and renaming it to Atatürk Teacher Training Academy (Atatürk Öğretmen Akademisi).
Today.
Atatürk Teacher Training Academy offers two undergraduate and one graduate programmes. The students are admitted through an entrance exam and interviews held by the university and the Ministry of Education and Culture. Students are trained to receive undergraduate degrees either in primary school education or in pre-school education. Public primary schools and pre-school institutions only employ the graduates of these programmes.
Public secondary education institutions only can employ teachers with pedagogic education. The Academy also offers a Master of Education degree for those who do not have the necessary qualifications.
Administration.
Atatürk Teacher Training Academy is governed by the five members who are appointed by the Council of Ministers directly. These members forms the Executive Committee and elects a president between them. The president must have the minimum academic title of Associate Professor, while must have worked in an academic position for at least five years.
The executive board appoints the Academy Presidential Board. The president of this board is named the President of the Academy and is the head of academic administration of the institution. The current President of the Academy is associate professor Zehra Özçınar.

The InforMEA initiative is facilitated by the United Nations Environment Programme and supported by the European Union. It seeks to develop Inter-operable information systems for the benefit of the (MEA)Parties and the environment community at large. 
Since the launch of the InforMEA platform in 2011 the services of InforMEA have expanded from providing a Thesaurus on Environmental Law and Conventions to enabling access to MEA related information in the form of decisions, resolutions, news, calendars of events, a glossary, lists of Parties, national focal points, national reports and strategies. InforMEA also provides access to 28 free online e-learning courses related to the MEA's, which are used in University curriculum's including that of Macquarie University in Sydney, the University of Eastern Finland and the UN system staff college (UNSSC).
The InforMEA Initiative consists of 20 Multilateral Environmental Agreements hosted with four United Nations bodies. MEAs include: Basel, Rotterdam, Stockholm and Minamata (Chemicals and Wastes); CBD(Biodiversity); CITES (Trade in Wildlife); ITPR-FA (Plants); Vienna (Ozone); Ramsar (Wetlands); UNESCO-WHC (World Heritage); UNCCD (Deserts); UNFCCC (Climate Change); 5 UNECE Conventions and a number of regional conventions.

Woodhouse Lane Stadium

Woodhouse Lane Stadium was a greyhound racing and speedway stadium, located in Wigan.
Origins.
The stadium was constructed and opened in 1928, in only the second year of oval track greyhound racing in the United Kingdom. The stadium known as the Woodhouse Lane Stadium was located on the east side of Woodhouse Lane where it met Beech Hill Lane and the south side of Baytree Road. It was built on open farmland next door to the Springfield Park football ground.
Opening.
Racing started on 17 March 1928 and racing was independent (unaffiliated to a governing body). Wigan Borough F.C. resigned from the football league during the 1931–32 season. Shortly after Borough went out of business and a new club, Wigan Athletic F.C., was formed and continued to play their home games at Springfield Park. After lengthy negotiations, Wigan Athletic purchased the ground from the owners of the Woodhouse Lane Stadium for £2,800 with the proviso that greyhound racing never take place at Springfield Park.
The independent racing lasted for 33 years.
Speedway.
Speedway took place at the stadium in 1952 and 1953.
Closure.
The final meeting took place during April 1961 and became an athletics arena.

Timothy March (born April 28, 1987 in Toronto) is a Canadian curler. He currently plays lead on Team Glenn Howard.
Career.
Youth.
March skipped his high school team from Sir Oliver Mowat Collegiate Institute to a provincial Schoolboy championship in 2005.
Men's.
March played third on the Annandale Country Club team that were runners up at the 2010 The Dominion Curling Club Championship. The team had won the provincial curling club championship that year. 
March joined the Mark Kean rink in 2010, playing lead on the team. In 2011, the team played in their first Grand Slam event, the January 2011 Canadian Open. The team finished the event with an 0-5 record. Also that season, the team made it to their first provincial championship, the 2011 Dominion Tankard. There, the team finished with a 6-4 record, missing the playoffs.
In the 2011-12 season, the Kean rink played in two slams, the 2011 World Cup of Curling (0-5 record) and the December 2011 Canadian Open (1-4 record). The team played in the 2012 Dominion Tankard, missing the playoffs with a 3-7 record.
In the 2012-13 season, Team Kean had a better season on Tour, winning the 2012 KW Fall Classic and playing in four slams. They played in the 2012 Masters of Curling (0-5 record), the 2012 Canadian Open of Curling (semifinalists), the 2013 National (1-4 record) and the 2013 Players' Championship (0-4). The team did not qualify for the men's provincial championship that season.
The rink played in the 2013 Canadian Olympic Curling Pre-Trials, finishing with a 1-3 record, and not qualifying for the Olympic Trials. They then played in the 2013 Canadian Open of Curling, losing in the quarterfinals. The team disbanded mid-season, but March would play in two more Slams that year, playing lead for Travis Fanset at the March 2014 National going 0-5 and playing lead for John Epping at the 2014 Players' Championship, losing in the quarterfinals.
The next season, March remained on the Epping rink. Early on in the season, they won the 2014 Village of Taunton Mills Gord Carroll Curling Classic. They played in five slams that season, making it to the semifinals of the 2014 Masters and 2015 Players' Championship, while missing the playoffs at the November 2014 National, the 2014 Canadian Open of Curling and the 2015 Elite 10. The team played in the 2015 Ontario Tankard (men's provincials), making it to the final before losing to March's former skip, Mark Kean.
In the 2015–16 season, Team Epping would play in seven Grand Slam events, winning the 2015 Meridian Canadian Open, the team's first Slam title. In the other slams, the team made lost in the finals of the 2016 Humpty's Champions Cup, made it to the semifinals of the 2015 National, the quarterfinals of the 2016 Elite 10, while the team missed the playoffs at the 2015 GSOC Tour Challenge, 2015 Masters of Curling, 2016 Players' Championship. The team also played in the 2015 Canada Cup of Curling, where they made it to the semifinal. At the 2016 Ontario Tankard, the team again made it to the finals, but lost to Team Glenn Howard in the final. That season, the team also won the 2016 US Open of Curling.
In the 2016–17 season, the Epping rink again played in all seven slams, making it to the semifinals of the 2017 Humpty's Champions Cup, the quarterfinals of the 2016 WFG Masters and the 2016 Boost National, and missed the playoffs at the 2016 GSOC Tour Challenge, 2017 Meridian Canadian Open, the 2017 Elite 10 and the 2017 Players' Championship. Elsewhere on the tour, the team won the 2016 CookstownCash presented by Comco Canada Inc. and the 2016 Challenge de Curling de Gatineau. At the 2016 Canada Cup of Curling, the team again lost in the semifinal. At the 2017 Ontario Tankard, the team lost in the semifinal against Wayne Tuck Jr..
The team qualified for the 2017 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, finishing in last place in the nine-team field, with a 2–6 record. In 2018, the team won the Ontario Tankard, making it to the 2018 Tim Hortons Brier. They finished the round robin in second place with a 9–2 record, earning themselves a spot in the 1 vs. 2 page playoff game against Team Canada.

Cosolvent

In chemistry, cosolvents are substances added to a primary solvent in small amounts to increase the solubility of a poorly-soluble compound. Their use is most prevalent in chemical and biological research relating to pharmaceuticals and food science, where alcohols are frequently used as cosolvents in water (often less than 5% by volume) to dissolve hydrophobic molecules during extraction, screening, and formulation. Cosolvents find applications also in environmental chemistry and are known as effective countermeasures against pollutant non-aqueous phase liquids, as well as in the production of functional energy materials and synthesis of biodiesel.
The topic of cosolvency has attracted attention from many theorists and practicing researchers who seek to predict the solubility of compounds using cosolvent systems, and it is the subject of considerable research in scientific literature. Studies exist to propose and review methods of modeling cosolvency using calculation, to describe empirical correlations of cosolvents and observed solvation phenomena, and to report the utility of cosolvent systems in various fields.
In Pharmaceuticals.
Long-standing challenges in pharmaceutical chemistry include overcoming the inherent hydrophobicity/lipophilicity of certain molecules for treatment and finding effective synthesis procedures for complex molecules. Cosolvents are able to aid researchers in both the trials of formulation and synthesis.
Formulation.
In pharmaceutical chemistry, numerous methods exist to help solubilize poorly water-soluble drugs for use in treatment. These methods include cosolvency, hydrotropism, complexation, ionization, and using surface active agents. The most pervasive is the application of non-toxic cosolvents with water to produce formulations that can dissolve hydrophobic molecules while maintaining cohesion with biological systems. Common cosolvents for this purpose are ethanol, propylene glycol, glycerine, glycofural, and polyethylene glycols. The effect of cosolvency on drug solubilization can be great, as evidenced by a 2009 study in which researchers from Panjab University showed the solubility of various anti-diabetic drugs increase by more than 500 times by use of a cosolvent.
Synthesis.
Cosolvents prove useful in synthetic applications as well as in formulation. Cosolvent systems are commonly specific to the synthetic target being studied, so reviewed here are the generalized findings of several publications that exemplify important points on the subject:
In a 2017 project, researchers at Cornell University studied the effect of cosolvency in oxazolidinone enolizations mediated by lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LiHMDS). This reaction pathway was exemplified by the group in the synthesis of filibuvir, a drug used for the treatment of hepatitis C that is produced on plant-scale by Pfizer. The researchers focus primarily on polymer formation in systems of tetrahydrofuran with hydrocarbon cosolvents, and find that the rate is strongly sensitive to the cosolvent utilized. Among other results, the study concludes that cosolvent choice is of acute importance in the pharmaceutical industry where percent yield, trace impurities, and processing techniques are chemically, financially, and toxicologically relevant. However, the researchers take care to mention that the mechanisms that bring about these empirical differences in cosolvent systems are not yet well-understood.
A 2016 paper from researchers at Hokkaido University describes a cosolvent-promoted mechanism for benzylating hydroxyl groups in the synthesis of sucrose derivatives. The group reports a method by which the benzylation reaction, empirically low yielding and with significant formation of byproducts due to the generally low reactivity of the target 1’-hydroxyl group in sucrose, was carried out to up to 95% yields with excellent selectivity for the synthetic molecule. They accomplished this yield by utilizing a cosolvent system of hexanes and methylene chloride, and extrapolated the method to include a number of benzyl halide substrates, as well as alcohols, glucose, and ribose derivatives. This study is one of many where reaction yields in organic synthesis can be optimized by application of polar/non-polar cosolvent systems.
Cosolvents also play a role in the biochemical subdiscipline: a 2012 study from researchers at the South China University of Technology reports how cosolvent parameters can be optimized to obtain higher yields in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Specifically, the group looked at the prune seed meal-catalyzed synthesis of bioactive anti-depressant salidroside, and found that using ethylene glycol diacetate in conjunction with an ionic liquid cosolvent afforded up to a 50% increase in product yield. The use of ionic liquids as cosolvents in this study and many similar demonstrates the variability of this methodology, where cosolvent systems can extend beyond standard conventions of polar and non-polar solvents to affect change on a mechanistic level.
In Environmental Chemistry.
Cosolvents have long been reported to be effective tools in environmental chemistry, both as powerful means of pollution remediation and as important additives in syntheses of green technologies, such as solar cells, biofuels, and sorbents. In some cases, the utilization of cosolvents also allows for satisfaction of a broad goal in the field of green chemistry: reduction in unsustainable solvent use by enhancing substrate solubility or providing greener alternatives.
Remediation.
In the context of aqueous pollutant remediation, cosolvents can be used in a variety of functions, including to enhance the performance of surfactants, to increase solubility of a non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL), and to physically mobilize NAPLs by decreasing interfacial tension between aqueous and organic phases. Due to toxicological concerns, the main agents used for remediation are aqueous solutions of 1-5% alcohols by volume, which can be flushed through a polluted site and later extracted from the bulk water. This “cosolvent flooding” (called alcohol flooding when using &gt;5% by volume) is often combined with salinity modification, "in situ" chemical oxidation, and temperature alteration to provide the most effective methods of removing NAPLs from a water source. "In situ" flushing is a process by which soil is decontaminated in a similar manner as aqueous environments.
Complications that arise from using alcohol cosolvents in aqueous remediation include the formation of macroemulsions, desorption of organic contaminants from aquifer solids, and introduction of toxicity, flammability, and explosivity at higher concentrations.
Green Technologies.
The versatile and variable nature of cosolvents has allowed them to be used in many applications regarding green technology. One such application is in the processing of polymer solar cells, where cosolvents have been recognized as being important additives to reduce phase separation of main solvent into droplets, which disrupts continuity in the sample and leads to less favorable morphologies. In most cases, a cosolvent is used in 1-10% by volume and acts by encouraging polymer aggregation in either the casting or solution evaporation stages. While the use of cosolvents in this context is nearly ubiquitous in organic solar cell research, there remains a lack of understanding on the dynamical processes by which cosolvency achieves this effect.
Cosolvents also play an important role in the production of biofuels from assorted biomass. For example, in efforts to convert used sunflower oil into biodiesel via transesterifcation, the utilization of a cosolvent in methanol was found responsible for improving product conversion from 78% to near completion in a short time frame. In another example, a tetrahydrofuran-water mixture was found to be incredibly effective in extracting lignin from biomass to yield fermentable sugars, despite that both THF and water are poor solvents for this purpose. By simplifying the synthesis and processing procedures for these and other developing green technologies, cosolvents are reducing waste from lost yields, poor solubility of substrates, and excess processing. As time moves forward, even better systems are being developed, and directed research into greener cosolvents is being explored.
Approximating Cosolvent Effects.
A variety of models exist to describe and predict the effects of cosolvents. Relying heavily on the application of mathematical models and chemical theory, these models range from simple to relatively complex. The first model and also the simplest is still in use today: the model of Yalkowsky. Yalkowsky’s model utilizes the algebraic mixing rule or log-linear model:
logXm = ƒ1logX1 + ƒ2logX2
Where Xm is the mole fraction solubility of the solute, X1 and X2 denote the mole fraction solubility in neat cosolvent and water.
While this model is only correlative in nature, further analysis allows for the creation of a predictive element. Simplifying the above equation to:
logXm = logX2 + σ • ƒ1
Where σ is the solubilization power of the cosolvent and theoretically is equal to log(X1/X2).
One can incorporate the work of Valvani et al., which shows:
σ = M • logKow + N
Where M and N are cosolvent constants that are not dependent on the nature of the solute, and have been tabulated for many commonly-used cosolvents. These transformations effectively turn the Yalkowsky log-linear model into a predictive model, where a researcher can predict with fair accuracy the cosolvent concentration for solubilization of a compound using only aqueous solubility data. For a more in-depth discussion of cosolvent modeling systems, the reader is directed to reviews by Jouyban (2008), Smith and Mazo (2008), and for biochemical context, Canchi and Garcia (2013).
A simpler view at choosing cosolvents involves looking at measureable properties of varying cosolvent systems and making a determination from empirical evidence. Researchers from the University of Arizona and the University of Wisconsin-Madison review a selection of parameters in an Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry paper, among them the partition coefficient, surface tension, dielectric constant, interfacial tension, and others. Using naphthalene as a representative case of solubilizing hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs), the authors report that a majority of the most commonly-used parameters fall short of accurately describing solubility, including dielectric constant, partition coefficient, and surface tension. Instead, they find that Hildebrand’s solubility parameter, Et(30), and interfacial tension correlate more favorably with empirical trends. The practicing chemist should take these results into account when developing a cosolvent system for a given target.

A Lone Voice

A Lone Voice was a radio programme consisting of Glyn Worsnip’s autobiographical account of living with a serious medical condition. First aired on March 2, 1988 (repeated March 6, 1988), the programme formed the first episode of "Soundtrack", at that time a new series of ‘films for radio’ in the tradition of fly on the wall realism.
History.
Glyn Worsnip was a well-known radio and television personality from the 1970s and ’80s, whose voice had become part of the fabric of Radio 4, where he presented programmes including: "Sound Archives Feature", the "Saturday Feature", "Stop Press", as well as Radio 2’s "The Press Gang".
By 1987, the BBC started receiving complaints from listeners who observed that Worsnip’s speech was not as fluent as it ought to be or it used to be. These speech difficulties which ultimately cost him his career were caused by a rare and progressive condition cerebellar ataxia. In a rare step for that time, Worsnip came out about his illness and the realities of living with such a condition.
Described by Peter Davalle in "The Times" as ‘a medical history told by the sufferer’, the programme was a warts and all audio diary detailing hospital visits, conversations with other sufferers, confidences with his family, and self-observations.
"A Lone Voice" was the most engaging programme in Radio 4’s history with the BBC taking on extra staff to manage the volume of listeners’ letters.
In subsequent years this ground-breaking format of a respected presenter speaking candidly on serious or terminal illness has been taken up by others including "The World at One" presenter Nick Clarke whose audio diary "Fighting to Be Normal" was broadcast in 2006 and journalist Steve Hewlett's conversations on the "PM" programme in 2016-17.

Frederick W. Hager

Frederick W. Hager (December 31, 1874 - March 3, 1958) was an American musician, recording artist, composer, and music director active between 1895 and 1923.
Biography.
Early life and recording and bandleader.
Hager was born in New Milford, Pennsylvania in 1874 and began studying violin at 8 years old. He received a scholarship to study violin at the National Conservatory, and led his own band in New York City at the age of 21. 
In 1898 he began recording for Harms, Kaiser and Hagen, a recently formed independent record company based in New York and in September of that year won the Phonoscope gold medal for best violin record for Schumann's Traumerei. He began recording for Edison in 1899 and Zonophone and Columbia in 1900. Between 1900 and 1907 Hager served as a bandleader for Edison (Edison's Concert Band), Zonophone (Hager's Orchestra), and Columbia (Columbia Orchestra, Climax Orchestra) recording hundreds of sides and becoming the nation's leading recording orchestra.
Composing.
He was composing at the same time, and beginning around 1903 published a number of successful popular songs, including Laughing Water, The Midnight Flyer, and My Ramapoo. 
Music publishing and directing.
He worked in music publishing between 1907 and 1910 before returning to the recording industry as a musical director (choosing artists and repertoire) for several startup companies including the Boston Talking Machine Company, Keen-O-Phone, and Rex Talking Machine. In 1918 he began as musical director for OKeh Records, one of the most successful independent labels of the time. In this role he managed the recording of Mamie Smith's historic recording of Crazy Blues that initiated the "Race Records" craze in the U.S. Hager retired from recording in 1923 to Long Island, New York and died in Dunedin, Florida in 1958.

Wabasha Rail Bridge (historical)

The Wabasha Rail Bridge was a floating pontoon bridge which crossed the Mississippi River north of Wabasha, Minnesota, between Reads Landing, Minnesota and Trevino, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Road constructed the bridge in 1882, connecting the Chippewa Valley Line to the Milwaukee Road Main Line on the Minnesota side of the Mississippi River. The bridge was similar to the Pile-Pontoon Railroad Bridge at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin.
Replacement spans were built in 1890 and 1932. Use of the bridge was discontinued in 1951 following a washout; the Milwaukee Road instead obtained trackage rights from Winona, Minnesota to Trevino, to continue use of the Chippewa Valley Line.

A defender, Oliver joined the Manchester City Academy at the age of 8. He progressed to sign a professional contract at the age of 18 and broke into the EDS. He made three appearances during the EDS' 2017–18 EFL Trophy campaign and spent the second half of the 2017–18 season away on loan. Oliver spent much of the first half of the 2018–19 season away on loan and departed at the end of the campaign, when his contract expired.
Fleetwood Town (loan).
On 31 January 2018, Oliver joined League One club Fleetwood Town on loan until the end of the 2017–18 season. He made the first professional appearance of his career three days later, as a substitute for Conor McAleny after 44 minutes of a 3–2 defeat to Scunthorpe United. It proved to be the only appearance of Oliver's spell, as he dropped out of the first team squad after the appointment of new head coach John Sheridan on 22 February 2018. Oliver played for the Development Squad in its run to the 2018 Lancashire Senior Cup Final and departed Highbury when his loan expired.
Brentford (loan).
On 31 August 2018, Oliver joined the B team at Championship club Brentford on loan until 1 January 2019. He made 15 appearances for the B team before the expiration of his loan.
Southport.
On 15 November 2019, Oliver joined National League North club Southport on a free transfer. On 4 March 2020, three days prior to his 19th and final appearance of the cancelled 2019–20 season, it was announced that Oliver had signed a new one-year contract. Oliver made 18 appearances during the 2020–21 season (which was again curtailed) and he was retained for 2021–22.

Blackfox (2019 film)

Blackfox is a Japanese anime film produced by studio 3Hz. It premiered in Japan on October 5, 2019.
Plot.
Rikka Isurugi is a young girl living at her family home at the edge of Brad City. She is the descendant of ninjas and is expected to follow in the steps of her grandfather, Hyoei Isurugi, and become the next family head. However she wants to be like her father, Allen Isurugi, a renowned robot scientist. One day, Rikka returns home from school for her birthday to find it being attacked by a hit squad led by her father's former colleague, Lauren, intent on obtaining his research, including three AI robotic animal drones: Kasumi the eagle, Oboro the dog and Madara the flying squirrel. Hyoei tries to fight back, only to be restrained and mortally wounded by Lauren's daughter, an esper who is under his control through an electronic collar. Allen is shot and dies, but the drones take Rikka to safety, where she vows to avenge her family.
Six months later, Rikka is now going under the alias "Lily" and is living in a small apartment with her roommate, Melissa. She works as a detective-in-training for Harold Berkeley and uses the animal drones to find information about her family's murderers which are linked to the Gradsheim company. Lily observes one of their facilities, but is caught by security. She is fortunately helped out by a girl named Mia, who vouches for her, and the two become fast friends. That night, Lily infiltrates the facility to retrieve her father's research. However, she is caught by Lauren and the esper, who's revealed to be Mia. Upon discovering Lily's identity, Lauren orders Mia to kill her, but she resists his control and goes berserk; destroying the facility and allowing Lily to flee with her.
The animal drones prevent Lily from killing Mia, and she takes Mia to her apartment where Melissa helps her recuperate. Lauren sends a military drone created using Allen's AI research to kill Lily, but together Lily and Mia lure the drone to Lily's home, where they disable it using the house's ninja traps. Lauren then attacks them and destroys the house using esper powers gained from his research on Mia. Mia fights him but is defeated, while Lily finds a recording of her father and grandfather, wishing her a happy birthday and giving her a present: a "Black Fox" ninja suit with cybernetic enhancements. Once again embracing her true identity as "Rikka," she dons the suit and defeats Lauren. However, he then puts the electronic control collar on Mia and transfers his powers to her, killing himself in the process, causing her to attack Rikka. In the end, with the help of the animal drones, Rikka manages to destroy the collar and free Mia.
Later, the president of Gradsheim, Brad Ingram, holds a press conference where he denies any involvement in the incident with the military drone, but Rikka recognizes him as the mastermind behind the attack on her family. Rikka, now going by the codename "Black Fox", with the aid of Mia, Melissa, and the animal drones, plans to go after Brad next.

Lindahl was in the middle of graduate school, which she put on hold, when she came up with the idea for the jockbra. Lindahl's sister Victoria Woodrow called her up one day to complain about her painful experiences having to just wear a normal bra while working out. During the course of Lindahl and theater costume designer Polly Smith's exploration for a better alternative, Lindahl's husband suggested that what they needed was a jockstrap for women's breasts. In the costume shop of Royall Tyler Theatre at the University of Vermont, Lindahl and Smith actually sewed two jockstraps together and nicknamed it a "jockbra". Smith's assistant, Hinda Schreiber, also helped with creating the bra. It was later renamed a "jogbra". One of their original Jogbras is bronzed and on display near the costume shop of the theatre. Two others are housed by the Smithsonian and another by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.
For years Lindahl held the role of president, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board for selling the invention. Then in 1990 Playtex purchased the invention. After Playtex's purchasing of the company, Lindahl still served as Co-President of the Jogbra.
Epilepsy.
Lisa Lindahl suffers from epilepsy herself, and has made it one of her main goals to educate others on the topic. Lindahl took upon the role of Senior Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Epilepsy Foundation for several years. While holding this position Lindahl created The Women and Epilepsy Health Initiative, which has given opportunities for researchers to study the gender differences in epilepsy. For all her work to help the cause, the Epilepsy Foundation gave Lindahl a National Personal Achievement Award. Lindahl was also awarded a Congressional Commendation for her work on epilepsy by Vermont Senator, Jeffords in 1999.
Bellisse Compressure Comfort Bra.
In later years, Lindahl joined with Dr. Lesli Bell to create a form of her previous bra invention that would serve as a compression bra to help breast cancer patients overcome the pain and discomfort associated with procedures. With Lindahl's prior knowledge of designing and entrepreneurship, in 2001 the two ladies invented the Compression Comfort Bra. Along with the creation of the Compression Comfort Bra, Lindahl also worked to educate people about truncal lymphedema, which many women with breast cancer suffer from, and Dr. Bell has continued teaching the public about this issue, and is now a world renowned public speaker on the topic.
Other contributions.
Lindahl has also put her education and practice to good use by teaching a Women's Small Business Program at Trinity College in Burlington, Vermont. She also co-authored the book used in her course, "Minding Your Business". Lindahl also taught business at Champlain College and Trinity College. She later served as a Trustee of the Vermont Land Trust, which is an organization devoted to conserving Vermont's landscape. Lindahl as well participated in a support and backing network for entrepreneurs. She was nominated for the Boss of the Year Award, and Entrepreneur of the Year award, by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers’ Association, and by Inc. Magazine. Lindahl was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in 2020 alongside co-inventors Hinda Miller and Polly Smith.
Present day.
Lisa Lindahl's most recent publication is "Unleash The Girls, The Untold Story of the Invention of the Sports Bra and How It Changed the World and Me," a business memoir about women in business dealing with success, power issues and personal growth. Her previous book, titled "Beauty as Action, the Way of True Beauty and How its Practice can Change our World." is a self-help book for individuals who want to contribute to changing the current societal paradigm. Lisa Lindahl now resides in South Carolina where she continues to write and make art .

2018 Indian Super Cup Final

The 2018 Indian Super Cup Final was a football match between East Bengal and Bengaluru, played on 20 April 2018, at the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. The match was a culmination of the 2018 Indian Super Cup, a knockout football tournament in India run by the All India Football Federation. This was the first edition of the Super Cup, the successor to the Federation Cup. Bengaluru won the tournament after defeating East Bengal 4–1. A brace from captain Sunil Chhetri and goals each from Rahul Bheke and Miku were enough for Bengaluru to get past East Bengal who scored once through Ansumana Kromah.
Both teams qualified for the tournament after finishing within the top six in both their respective leagues, the I-League and Indian Super League. Prior to this match, both East Bengal and Bengaluru only played each other in league matches when Bengaluru was part of the I-League.
The final was televised on Star Sports and online on Hotstar. The match took place at the Kalinga Stadium which had hosted every match of the tournament up till this match.
Road to the final.
The Super Cup is a new annual Indian knock-out football competition that is open to all ten teams in the I-League and Indian Super League and is run by the All India Football Federation. The tournament is a replacement for the Federation Cup, the previous domestic competition for Indian football.
The top six teams in both leagues during their 2017–18 seasons automatically qualified for the competition. The bottom four from each league had to go through a qualification stage. East Bengal finished in fourth in the I-League and thus qualified directly for the Super Cup. Bengaluru meanwhile finished in first during the Indian Super League but ended as runners-up after losing in the final.
East Bengal.
Prior to the 2018 Indian Super Cup, East Bengal had reached the final of the Federation Cup, India's previous top domestic cup competition, 16 times and won the tournament eight times. Most recently, East Bengal won the competition in 2012. They began their Super Cup campaign on 5 April 2018 against Indian Super League side Mumbai City. Mumbai City took an early lead in the 22nd minute through Achille Emaná before Katsumi Yusa scored an equalizer for East Bengal four minutes later. East Bengal then took the lead in the 73rd minute through Mahmoud Amnah and went on to win the match 2–1. In the quarter-final, the club took on fellow I-League side Aizawl. The match was a highly contested and was only won six minutes into second half stoppage time from a Laldanmawia Ralte penalty. East Bengal won 1–0.
In the semi-finals, East Bengal again took on an Indian Super League when they faced off against Goa. Goa entered the match heavily depleted after losing three players through suspension in their last match while also not having some players due to injury. With that the case, East Bengal managed to secure a 1–0 victory and confirm their place in the Super Cup Final with Dudu Omagbemi scoring in the 78th minute.
Bengaluru.
Bengaluru had competed in the Federation Cup only four times as the club was only founded in 2013. In those four appearances, the club managed to win the competition twice, in 2014–15 and the last edition of the tournament in 2016–17. Bengaluru began their Super Cup campaign on 1 April 2018 against the Gokulam Kerala. Henry Kisekka began the scoring in the match for Gokulam Kerala in the 33rd minute. Bengaluru soon found an equalizer through Miku before Udanta Singh found the winner for the club two minutes into stoppage time. The club then went to take on NEROCA in the quarter-finals on 13 April. Bengaluru captain Sunil Chhetri scored a hattrick as he helped his side secure a 3–1 victory over their I-League opponents.
In the semi-finals, Bengaluru took on Mohun Bagan, the club they defeated in the Federation Cup final in 2017. During the match, Bengaluru found themselves down at halftime after Aser Pierrick Dipanda scored in the 42nd minute. However, second half saw Bengaluru respond with four goals, three from Miku and one from Chhetri, as they took a 4–1 lead. Dipanda then scored a second for Mohun Bagan in stoppage time but it was too late as Bengaluru won and clinched their spot in the final with a 4–2 victory.
Pre-match.
Venue.
On 7 March 2018, it was announced by the All India Football Federation that the Kalinga Stadium in Bhubaneswar, Odisha would host the entire Super Cup. The venue had not previously hosted any edition of the Federation Cup. In addition, none of the 20 teams that participated in the Super Cup were based in Bhubaneswar or the entire state of Odisha. However, Jamshedpur, one of the Indian Super League clubs did play one match at the stadium towards the end of the 2017–18 ISL season.
Originally, the entire tournament was set to take place in Kochi, Kerala. On 4 March 2018, a couple weeks before the Super Cup qualifiers, Jamshedpur head coach Steve Coppell had told the media that all he knew about the tournament was that it would take place in Kochi. However, when AIFF officials inspected the Kalinga Stadium during the Jamshedpur match in February, they were impressed with the facilities around the stadium.
Analysis.
Coming into this match, both sides looked at it as a chance to win some silverware after they both lucked out in their respective league campaigns. Since Bengaluru had finished as runners-up during the Indian Super League, they were considered favorites. Albert Roca, the Bengaluru head coach, stressed before the match that their hunger and confidence would help them in this match: "The Super Cup final is another chance and we will be going into the game with the right amount of confidence. We've been consistent and have had a fantastic season so far. It would be nice to have a trophy for our efforts." According to Goal.com, the club were expected to enter the match using a 3–5–2 formation, with key players Sunil Chhetri and Miku leading the attack. Left back Nishu Kumar would be suspended for this match after gaining a red card in the previous match while defenders Rahul Bheke and Juanan were doubts to play.
Khalid Jamil, the East Bengal head coach, said that his team must remain positive before the match and apprehensive of Bengaluru. "It is the last match of the season. Bengaluru FC is a great team, no doubt. We cannot afford to make mistakes," he said. East Bengal centerback, Eduardo Ferreira, meanwhile made some comments to the media as he was part of the Mohun Bagan side which took on Bengaluru in the final of the Federation Cup in 2017: "I know they have good players and a good coach. One of the best teams in the country. But we have to keep focus and play well. Last year's Fed Cup final is past. I am thinking about tomorrow's game. I want to give my best tomorrow."
According to Goal.com, East Bengal were expected to enter the match using a 4–1–4–1 formation. Midfielder Mohammed Rafique would be unavailable due to injury and striker Dudu Omagbemi was a doubt.
Match.
Summary.
Prior to the match, it was announced that both Juanan and Rahul Bheke had passed fitness tests and were starting for Bengaluru. For East Bengal, Dudu Omagbemi wasn't fit enough for the starting eleven but was on the bench. Within the first minute of the match, Bengaluru had earned a corner kick before East Bengal were able to get their first attack at Bengaluru. East Bengal's Ansumana Kromah was able to draw a foul outside the box and Bengaluru's Gurpreet Singh Sandhu and John Johnson were both given yellow cards. Kromah would eventually find the opening goal of the match in the 27th minute. Sandhu made a mistake on a corner as Kromah scored off a bicycle kick. The lead would only last for 12 minutes though as Bengaluru soon equalized through Rahul Bheke's header off a Víctor Pérez cross. Finally, before halftime, East Bengal's Samad Ali Mallick was sent off after attempting to punch Subhasish Bose, reducing the club to 10 men.
During the second half, East Bengal began putting the pressure on Bengaluru and scored a goal. Unfortunately, the goal scored by Kromah was judged to be offside after the Liberian striker attempted to put in a rebound after Sandhu saved a shot from Cavin Lobo. A few minutes later, Sandhu comes up big for Bengaluru after saving a free kick shot from Mahmoud Amnah. Later, in the 69th minute, a foul in East Bengal's box resulted in the referee awarding Bengaluru a penalty which was scored by Sunil Chhetri. Two minutes later, Bengaluru extended their lead when Miku scored his 20th goal in all competitions for the season. Finally, in the first minute of stoppage time, Chhetri wrapped the game up for Bengaluru by heading home the club's fourth goal and sealing a 4–1 victory.
Post-match.
During the post-match press conference, Bengaluru head coach Albert Roca praised his team and said that they were the most consistent side during the entire season. Roca also expressed his happiness in winning the tournament for the fans while praising how his team reacted to being a goal down, "I am very happy for the supporters. This is the success we were looking forward to. Today we showed that my team has been the most consistent team this season." The club would soon resume their season five days later when they took on New Radiant of the Maldives in the AFC Cup.
Khalid Jamil after the match meanwhile praised his side, "Talking about this game, everybody worked very hard. I give all the credit to boys. They started well. The score wasn’t in our favour. No complaint from my side." Jamil was also very critical of the refereeing performance during the match, especially during Samad Ali Mallick's red card and Ansumana Kromah's disallowed goal. "Kromah’s goal, I don’t think it was offside. The result could have been different if Kromah's goal was not disallowed. Samad Ali’s red card was harsh, it could have been a yellow card. But I was far away and I couldn’t see properly." Six days later, on 26 April, it was announced by East Bengal that Jamil had been sacked by the club.

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea campaigns (1942)

Submarine warfare in the Black Sea in World War II during 1942 involved engagements between primarily submarines of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet attacking Axis merchantmen defended by Romanian and German naval warships. These engagements were a part of the Black Sea campaigns between Axis and Soviet naval forces.
Background.
As during the first 1941 campaign, the Soviet Navy sent submarines against the Axis supply lines along the western coast of the Black Sea. A number of neutral Turkish vessels were also attacked near the Bosporus area, resulting in the Struma disaster. Once again, Axis defenses primarily consisted of Romanian-laid fields of mines: 5000 mines were laid (both anti-submarine and floating), the Soviet Navy possessed 34 submarines including 14 of new construction but only 20 were operational ready. German U-boats began operating in the Black Sea during late 1942, without scoring any hits while the Romanian submarine Delfinul departed for her final patrols.
Sevastopol operations.
A separate action was accomplished (alongside other Soviet Navy units) to supply and later evacuate troops from the Siege of Sevastopol. While carrying away men from the besieged city, Soviet submarine ShCh-214 was torpedoed and sunk in surface action by Italian MAS boats on 19 June. A second loss occurred on 26 June when Soviet submarine "S-32" was sunk, most likely by German bombers (while Italian midget-submarines CB-3 and CB-4 also take credit of this victory but their attacks did not matched with S-32's last mission). With the Axis finally victorious in Sevastopol, the Soviet Navy scuttled submarines "D-6" and "A-1" to avoid their capture.
Outcome.
German U-boats of the 30th U-boat Flotilla failed to sink or damage enemy target during this first year of operations in Black Sea, while Delfinul departed for her last ineffective patrols. Soviet submarines have been extimated to have sunk 13 targets in the Black Sea (13,000 GRT) but only 6 of them directly supporting Axis operations on the Crimea. Other sources raise the total number to 17 targets sunk (but with less tonnage: 12,900 GRT).

Music collections in Pistoia

The Music collections in Pistoia show a chronological profile of the musical production of the city.
History.
The first testimonies were related to the sacred performances of the Passion of Christ which were located in the "Loggia del Giuramento", and were a central moment in the life of the citizens because the entire population was involved in the spectacular staging. Beginning in the 1500s, the Chappell of the Cathedral became the main musical organization, next to the single parishes and churches of the Dominican order and of San Filippo, the latter attended by nobility. Starting in the 1600s, the Rospigliosi family was central to the music scene in Pistoia, together with Melani and Pasquini. With their donations they succeeded in ensuring that the Chappell always continued to excel. In this period, the dynasties of composers Gherardeschi and Brunetti, who dominated the music in Pistoia even in the 1700s, were affirmed. The entire activity of the Chappell and the works of its masters, made up of compositions from scratch such as the performance and collection of the works of other composers, has been merged, and is today available for consult, in the preserved documents of the "Biliotheca Musicalis" of the Archive of the Chapter and at the Forteguerriana Library (Biblioteca Forteguerriana), while the materials produced by the single parishes are today found in the State Archive (Archivio di Stato), in the Leoniana Library at the Vescovile Seminary, the Old Library of Canonici (today at the Archive of the Chapter), and at the Dominican Library. 
Beginning in the 1600s, the large nobile families also began to patron the production of lyric opera, especially in the academic scene (The Accademia dei Risvegliati constructed its theater in 1677). Melani made their descendants acquire musical skills: Jacopo, Alessandro and Atto became esteemed composers and musicians in Italy and in France. However, the Rospigliosi family is still the family that left the greatest trace and documentation of operatic activities in Pistoia in the 1600s and on: the Rospigliosi Collection (today divided between the Archive of the Chapter and the Forteguerriana Library) attests to the great musical vitality of the citizens with a collection of music of the most influential composers in the world, performed in Pistoia until the end of the 1800s, which was the century in which the Rospigliosi salon, where many celebrities gathered, was one of the major cultural centers at the local level.. Parallel to the secular production, we cannot forget the production of sacred music (as is attested by the Music Collection of the Seminary, the Collection of the Parish of the Madonna dell'Umiltà (Mary of Umility), and the musical documents of the Fabroniana Library, rich in theoretical and historical texts that were especially pertinent to the 1700s). A composer of the 1800s, Teodulo Mabellini, for example, wrote both lyric operas and sacred music, and some of his compositions are today preserved as autographs in the Forteguerriana Library and in the Archive of the Chapter (see the Sources of Mabellini). In the 1800s, the Borgognoni Philharmonic and the School of Music and Dance were founded (later named Mabellini). The Philharmonic conducted an intense production of music and diffusion of sophisticated music, thanks to the many band arrangements, today preserved in their archive. The School is still functioning today. Beginning in the 1900s, the Philharmonic also accompanied the "caffé concerto" (the music produced for this performances are now at the Globo Cinema) and are still active today (the archive of the director Giuseppe Da Prato have documented the production of the band since 1973). In the 1900s, the musical possessions of Pistoia were enriched by the donations of many private citizens, who entrusted their books regarding music to the Forteguerriana Library (Chiappelli Collectioni, Martini Collection, Bellini Collection), to the Leoniana Library at the Seminary (Mazzei Collection and the Collection of Aldo Pacini, a collector, who possessed some autographs and antique printed editions). An exceptional testimony of music of the 1900s is at the Mabellini School of Music and Dance: the autographed arrangements by Carlo Savina for two concerts in Pistoia of the music of Nino Rota performed with the Orchestra of Rome of RAI in 1981.

Doreen Simmons

Doreen Sylvia Simmons (née Clarke; 29 May 1932 – 23 April 2018) was an English sumo commentator. After moving to Japan in 1973 she became an expert on sumo and was hired by NHK in 1992 to provide commentary for their English language sumo broadcasts. She was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun in 2017. 
Early life.
She was born in Nottingham, England, the daughter of a civil servant and a store manager. She attended Mundella Grammar School and sang in its choir. She was a keen follower of cricket as a teenager and would visit Trent Bridge cricket ground every Saturday. 
She studied theology and classics at Girton College, Cambridge and Hughes Hall, Cambridge from 1950 to 1954. 
Career.
After graduation from college, she became a Latin and Greek teacher. She spent much of the 1960s teaching at a British Army school in Singapore, where she married. She made a three-month visit to rural Japan where she stayed on a farm and saw her first sumo match on television during the March tournament of 1968. After returning to England she taught classics and was a contestant in the first series of "Mastermind," before deciding to return to Japan five years after her previous visit, securing a teaching post there in September 1973. 
She worked at the International Language Centre in Jinbōchō, Tokyo, and then joined the Foreign Press Center, editing translations of Foreign Ministry press releases. She also checked English language material for both the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors in the National Diet, and the National Diet Library.
Sumo commentary.
It was while working for the Foreign Press Center that Simmons first developed an interest in sumo.
She saw her first live sumo match in January 1974 and began to regularly attend tournaments in Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya. She wrote a bi-monthly sumo column for "Kansai Time Out" from 1983 and was a contributor to "Sumo World" magazine from 1987. In 1985 she revised the book "Sumo: From Rite to Sport, "originally published in 1979 by Patricia Cuyler. In 1992 she became a commentator for national broadcaster NHK, on their newly established English language sumo broadcasts. She was hired for her specialist knowledge to complement NHK's play-by-play commentators who were more familiar with baseball broadcasts. In 2017 she celebrated her 25th year commentating for NHK, and she was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun for her contribution to sumo. She lived in Sumida, Tokyo near sumo's heartland of Ryōgoku. She was a financial sponsor of Dewanoumi stable, one of the many training stables or "heya" for over 20 years, and had friendships with many sumo wrestlers and officials.
Other interests.
Simmons sang in Tokyo's British Embassy Choir. She also performed with the Tokyo International Players. She was a percussionist, playing the bodhrán and the djembe. She became a member of the Asiatic Society of Japan in 1980 and later served for some years on the ASJ Council. She went bungee jumping in Australia at age 68 and as a volunteer for Habitat for Humanity helped dig foundations for homes in Mongolia on her 71st birthday.
Personal life.
Her marriage to Bob Simmons had ended in divorce, and she had no children. 
Simmons died at her home in Tokyo on 23 April 2018 at the age of 85, of a pulmonary condition.

Leo Hale Taylor

Leo Hale Taylor was an American born priest of the Catholic Church. He was Archbishop of Lagos from 1939 to 1965. Taylor was the first principal of St Gregory's College, Lagos and as bishop, he was considered a pillar of support for the school.
Life.
Taylor was born in Minnesota to parents of English and Irish background. Educated at St Joseph's College, Wilton, Cork city, he was ordained a priest on June 23, 1914. Taylor was among the first group of trainee missionaries to attended SMA's seminary in Cork, Ireland. He was lifelong friends with Father Michael O'Flanagan, a nationalist sympathizer, a relationship that must have provoked nationalistic sentiments in Taylor. As founder of African Missionary, an SMA monthly newsletter, his writings were sympathetic to the nationalist cause.
His first missionary appointment was as a staff of the Vicariate of the Bight of Benin's Holy Cross Primary School in Lagos. He served at the school from 1920 to 1924, he then moved to Ibadan to serve as a teacher at St Theresa's Minor Seminary. When St Gregory's College Lagos became a full fledged college, Taylor was appointed its first principal. In February 1934, upon the death of the Irish Bishop of Western Nigeria, Taylor was nominated to succeed him. After the death of Bishop O'Rourke in Lagos, Taylor was brought back to Lagos as the new bishop.
Archbishop.
At the beginning of his tenure, the Abeokuta, Oyo and Ibadan Diocese was within the Archdiocese of Lagos. Taylor had the zeal of the early missionaries in West Africa, he spoke Yoruba and was known to sometimes correct the Yoruba interpreter. He was also an avid cyclist and frequently traveled to out stations by road or forest path to practice the sacrament of confirmation or administer to a dying baptized catholic.
To progress the mission of the church in Lagos and to close a gap in the need for elementary school teachers, Taylor established a teachers training school, Blessed Murumba's College at Ile-Ife in 1944. In 1943, he founded the Eucharistic Heart of Jesus Sisters at Ibonwon, an institution that practiced chastity and vows to poverty.
In 1951, Taylor accepted a request from Dominican fathers to manage a new parish in Yaba. The fathers came from St Alberts Province in Chicago. The Parish is now called St Dominic's Parish, Yaba.
He died in 1965.

Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art

The Dictionary of Science, Literature and Art was a single-volume reference work published in the mid-19th century by Longman's in the United Kingdom and by Harper Brothers in the United States. At the time it was considered a highly successful compendium of general but scholarly information. It was part of a trend toward cheaper, smaller reference works targeted at the middle and working classes.
The first edition was published in 1842 with 1352 pages. It was reprinted in 1845, 1847, 1848 and 1851. A second, revised edition was published in 1852 in 1423 pages. It was expanded to three volumes in 1866. The final edition was published in 1875 in three volumes.
The original editor in chief William Thomas Brande and associate editor was Joseph Cauvin. Upon Brandes death in 1866, Sir George William Cox took over as editor.
In the United States, the first edition was reprinted by Harper in 1844.
"Harper's Book of Facts".
Harper's later published a successor called "Harper's Book of Facts" in 1895 with an updated edition in 1906.

Leucospermum lineare

Leucospermum lineare is an evergreen shrub with linear leaves and is assigned to the Proteaceae. There are two distinct forms that have not been formally recognized as separate taxa. There is an upright form with orange flower heads of up to high, and a sprawling form of in diameter with yellow flower heads. Its common name is needle-leaf pincushion, or narrow-leaf pincushion, in English and smalblaarspeldekussing in Afrikaans. The orange-flowered form is called tangerine pincushion or assegaaibos pincushion. Flowering occurs in the first half of the southern hemisphere season, but peaks in September and October. It is an endemic species that can only be found in the southwest of the Western Cape province of South Africa.
Description.
"Leucospermum lineare" is an upright evergreen shrub of up to high, or a sprawling shrub of in diameter. The branches that bear flower heads are hairless in diameter, and may either be upright or spreading horizontally. The leaves are linear in shape and flat or with the margins rolled inwards, long and wide, pointing at an angle upwards, with two or three teeth near the leaf tip or without teeth.
The flower heads are usually solitary or grouped with two or three, have a flattened egg-shape, are in diameter, atop a stalk of long. The common base of the flowers within the same head has a very slim cone-shape with a pointy tip, long and wide. The bracts that subtend the flower head are oval with an pointy tip, about 1½ cm (0.6 in) long, overlapping, rubbery in consistency, softly hairy on the outside, with a dense row of hairs around the fringes. The bracts that subtend the individual flower are oval with a pointy tip, about 1 cm (0.4 in) long and wide, rubbery in consistency, and densely woolly at the base. The perianth is about long, S-shaped when opening, and pale yellow to orange in colour. Its base is fused into a tube of long, with a slight bulge at one side, smooth near the top. Perianth tube 7.0- 8.0 mm long. The anthers are atop a very short filament of about 1 mm. The style is 5–5½ cm (2.0–2.2 in) long, and near the upper end quadrangular and strongly bending towards the center of the flower head. It is topped by a slight thickening that is called the pollen presenter, which is obliquely oval in shape with a pointy tip, about 1½ mm (0.06 in) long, with the groove that functions as the stigma obliquely at the very tip. The oblong ovary look grey due to a dense cover of minute soft hairs, and surrounded by white hairs of about long, is subtended by four linear to awl-shaped scales that secrete the nectar (the so-called hypogynous scales) of about long.
The subtribe Proteinae, to which the genus "Leucospermum" has been assigned, consistently has a basic chromosome number of twelve (2n=24).
Taxonomy.
In 1768, Nicolaas Laurens Burman was the first to describe the needle-leaf pincushion, and he named it "Leucadendron lineare". Carl Peter Thunberg assigned the species to the genus "Protea", making the new combination "P. linearis" in 1781, but he had not noticed the name was already occupied in 1775, when Maarten Houttuyn used it for another species now known as "Leucadendron ericifolium". Joseph Knight published a book in 1809 titled "On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae", that contained an extensive revision of the Proteaceae attributed to Richard Anthony Salisbury. Salisbury named the needle-leaf pincushion "Leucadendrum fallax", a superfluous name since he referenced Burman, and should have adopted his species name. In 1810, Robert Brown called the species "Leucospermum lineare", but referenced Thunberg's homonym, where he should have taken up Burman's name. Michel Gandoger in 1901 distinguished the upright and orange-flowered form as "Leucospermum lineare" var. "calocephalum", which he raised together with Hans Schinz to a species in 1913, making the new combination "Leucospermum calocephalum". In 1970, John Patrick Rourke considered these forms not sufficiently different to merit the distinction and so regarded them as synonymous.
"L. lineare" has been assigned to the showy pincushions, section "Brevifilamentum".
The species name "lineare" is Latin, meaning "linear" or "line-shaped" and refers to the needle-like leaves.
Distribution, habitat and ecology.
The range of "L. lineare" extends from Bainskloof to the Klein Drakensteinberge. The form with horizontally sprawling branches and golden yellow flowers occurs is most widespread. An upright form with deep orange flowers grows at the Assegaaibos Kloof near French Hoek. The species mostly occurs in mountainous sites on heavy gravelly clay soils at elevations of , with an average annual precipitation of , most of which fall during the winter. In a few locations "L. lineare" occurs on Table Mountain Sandstone, but even there it is mostly underlain by weathered granite. Flowers can be found between July and January with a peak in September and October. Birds pollinate the flowers. The seeds fall from the flower heads after about 2 months. The seed is covered by a soft, sweet and fatty layer that emits pheromones (called elaiosome) that is coveted by ants. Indigenous ant species collect them and take them to their underground nests, where they eat the ant bread. The ants cannot move the large hard and slick seed when the ant bread is removed and so remains underground, safe from being eaten and fire. This seed dispersal strategy is called myrmecochory. Although the plants do not survive a fire, the seeds promptly germinate after a fire.
Cultivation.
"Leucospermum lineare" has been crossed with "L. cordifolium", "L. tottum" and "L. vestitum". Selections of the species and its hybrids are cultivated for cut-flowers and as garden plants.
Conservation.
"Leucospermum lineare" is considered a vulnerable species. The reasons for the decrease in population size include invasive plants, cut flower harvesting, and land transformation.

Cristina Luca Boico

Cristina Luca Boico (8 August 1916 – 16 April 2002) was a Romanian communist activist. After going into exile in France, she joined the French Resistance and worked in the intelligence service. At the end of the war, she returned to Romania and worked as the director of the Ministry of Education and numerous other governmental posts, until she was purged in 1952. Working as an editor for the Scientific Publishing House she later taught at the Politehnica University of Bucharest. In 1987, she left Romania to visit her children in Paris, refusing to return. For the remainder of her life, she gave lectures and published memoirs about the evolution of communism.
Early life.
Bianca Marcusohn was born on 8 August 1916 in Botoșani, Romania to Luisa (née Segal) and Isidor Marcusohn. Her family, which included an older sister, Hermina, belonged to the assimilated Jewish middle-class. Both she and her sister were deeply attached to Romanian culture and literature. The Kingdom of Romania was a deeply Francophile country as Romanian intellectuals embraced the idea of modelling the newly independent kingdom after France, Romania's "big Latin sister". Marcushon and her sister grew up reading French literature. After completing her secondary education at Carmen Sylva High School in Botoşani, Marcusohn moved to Bucharest to undertake medical studies. She later recalled about the Carmen Sylva school: "It was the nom de plume of Romania’s first queen, Elisabeth, the wife of Carol I. The school had an excellent national reputation. Teachers were selected among the very best, the discipline was severe. But it was in this high school that I had my first direct encounters with anti-Semitism...At the school, our teachers would have never made discriminatory or offensive statements-regardless of what they may have thought privately-but some girls with that family background maintained a certain distance from us". As an young woman, she was greatly influenced by the writings of the Romanian socialist Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. 
She joined the Students' Democratic Front, an organization aligned with the Romanian Communist Party and wrote articles for journals on the international anti-fascist movement. As an university student, she spent much at time at the Schuller, the dormitory set aside for Jewish students that was often attacked by anti-Semitic students. One student at the University of Bucharest remembered that many students spent "their time and energy in the absence of university sports on Jew-baiting or actual Jew-beating". In common with many other Jewish intellectuals in Eastern Europe, she was attracted to Communism because it promised to dissolve nationalities, religions and ethnicities, thereby rendering the "Jewish Question" moot as she recalled: "Communism promised a better world for all and, thereby, the genuine liberation of the Jewish people, allowing for a complete flourishing of its potential. Communism was supposed to bring about a democratic solution to the question of nationalities. Hardly anyone can imagine what it meant for us, young high school girls and boys". The Schuller was the center of much intellectual debate and discussion with the Jewish students mostly divided between the Communists who argued that only Communism could end antisemitism in Romania vs. the Zionists who argued that Romanian Jews should all leave for Palestine to establish a Jewish state there under the grounds there was no future for Jews in Romania. 
In 1931, the ACSE ("Asociatille Generale ale Studetilor Evrei"-General Union of Jewish Students), which managed the Schuller, was taken over by members of the illegal Union of Communist Youth, and thereafter, the Communist tendency at the Schuller tended to dominate at the expense of the Zionists. She was a friend of Lucien Goldmann and was influenced by his ideas. Like Goldmann, she favored staying in Romania and supported the Communists against the Zionists. Goldmann often took part in the debates at the Schuller, taking a Marxist line while also venturing into more esoteric topics such as the impact of the theories of Einstein and Freud for Marxism and the understanding of human sexuality. Goldmann's theories, which were regarded as eccentric, brought him into conflict with the Stalinist Union of Communist Youth, which accused him of Trotskyism. In 1937, after being expelled for her political activities, Marcusohn left Romania to continue her studies at the Sorbonne. On 28 December 1937, King Carol II of Romania appointed Octavian Goga of the extreme right-wing National Christian Party as prime minister. During Goga's short period in office, he passed a flood of anti-Semitic laws, one of which was to strip Romanian Jews of their Romanian citizenship. At the approach of the Nazi's the university was closed and per a posted notice, she was allowed to graduate by taking her final tests at any university offering them. Marcusohn made her way to Toulouse, where she completed her examinations and received her certificate in Natural Sciences in June 1940.
Career.
Marcusohn began working in the marine biology laboratory of Édouard Chatton in Banyuls-sur-Mer, but by September had decided to return to Paris. Once there, she contacted the Romanian affiliates of the French Communist Party and reconnected with the communist movement. Taking in mathematics students, she worked as a tutor and was eventually offered a post with to translate journal articles to French for researchers at the "Caisse nationale de la recherche scientifique", forerunner to the French National Center for Scientific Research. She participated in the 1940 demonstrations to protest the arrest of Paul Langevin and was arrested but quickly released. The anti-Semitic laws threatened the Jewish community in France with destitution, and the burden of poverty fell especially hard on women, and the all more so on immigrant Jewish women. In France, there were two terms for Jews; namely the "les Israélites" to describe Jews who had embraced the French language and culture, which was a respectful and polite term, and "les Juifs" for those Jews who were seen as having failed to properly embrace the French language and culture, which had derogatory connotations. French Jews were usually described politely as "Israélites" while the more derogatory term "les Juifs" was reserved for Jewish immigrants, especially from Eastern Europe. The popular image in France at the time of Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe was of a mass of illegal immigrants who lived in poverty, refused to assimilate and engaged in criminality; the fact that the number of Eastern European immigrants, and even more so of illegal immigrants was greatly exaggerated led to the perception that this was a major social problem. Marcusohn spoke fluent French, but as a stateless Jew from Romania, she was considered to be more of a "Juif" than an "Israélite" 
In 1941, Marcusohn joined the Organisation Spéciale—Main-d'Œuvre Immigrée (OS-MOI), the armed group of the Immigrant Labor Force, using the name Monique as a disguise. She was recruited into underground work by Boris Holban. She lost her translating job in 1942 and went to work full time, spying for the FTP-MOI. From the summer of 1942 onward, it was widely understood within the French Jewish community that the "Final Solution to the Jewish Question" was not deportation to some vague utopian Jewish homeland in Eastern Europe as the Nazis were promising, but rather genocide, which gave a major impetus to Jewish resistance. Marchusohn recalled that once it was understood that the threat was now an existential one of extermination that many Jews embraced resistance as the issue was one of survival. 
In 1942 when the OS-MOI merged with two other groups to form the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans—Main-d'Œuvre Immigrée (FTP-MOI), Marcusohn changed her name again, to Cristina Luca, and became and intelligence officer in the resistance. As the intelligence chief, she selected targets for resistance attacks and collected as much information as possible about the targets. The intelligence branch of the FTP-MOI was a largely female-dominated section, which reflected the prevailing assumptions that women were better suited for intelligence work while men were better suited for action. With the knowledge of her professors, Luca funneled stolen chemicals from the biology laboratory at the Sorbonne to the partisans. Between January-June 1943, the FTP-MOI staged 93 actions in Paris. In the first six months of 1943, the FTP-MOI were responsible for 14 train derailments, 34 acts of arson or bombings of buildings, and 43 assassinations in Paris. The FTP-MOI was regarded as an elite group within the FTP that was always assigned the most dangerous missions, which was seen as an honor. 
She specialized in constructing Molotov cocktails, and as the intelligence chief of the FTP-MOI she played a key role in the investigation to find the informer who betrayed Missak Manouchian and his group in November 1943. Ultimately, her investigation exposed as the informer as Joseph Davidowicz, the political commissar to the "groupe Manouchian", who was promptly killed. In 1944, she was assigned to combat duty for the entire north of France and participated in several partisan attacks. During the liberation of Paris between 19-25 August 1944, she took part in the revolt. Together with her fellow Romanian communists Holban, Gheorghe Vasilichi and Ion Marinescu, she led a group that seized the Romanian consulate and the Romanian tourist office in Paris, which was announced at the time as the first step towards the overthrow of the regime of the prime minister, Marshal Ion Antonescu. After the liberation, she joined the French Army as a lieutenant.
At the end of the war, Luca returned to Romania in March 1945. Between 1945 and 1947, she worked in the Ministry of Information and then went to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, where she worked at the Romanian embassy as a press-attaché for a year. During her time in Belgrade, she was a friend of Milovan Djilas, who at the time served as the vice-president of Yugoslavia and was Marshal Tito's right-hand man. Because of the Tito–Stalin Split, Luca was recalled to Romania and began working in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in charge of the press department. In 1949, she married Mihail Boico (born Rosner), a military officer in command of troops on the border. Shortly after the marriage, Stalin began targeting veterans of the Spanish Civil War and those who had been involved in the French Resistance, placing both Boico and her husband, who was known as Bibi, under suspicion. Besides for having served in the French Resistance, Boico's unwillingness to denoucne Tito and her friendship with Djilas placed her under suspicion as a "Titoist"; only her friendship with the Foreign Minister Anna Pauker kept her safe from the Securitate. Pauker's downfall removed her principle patron and protector from within the PCR. Boico was dismissed from her job in June, 1952 and Bibi was purged from his position in the Interior Ministry that same fall. Boico was assigned to a minor position in the Grigore Antipa National Museum of Natural History.
Disillusioned by the party, after 1956, Boico no longer participated in political activities, concentrating instead on her work in history and science. In the 1960s, she began working as the editor of the Scientific Publishing House and later taught courses on Marxism at the Politehnica University of Bucharest. Publishing a few book introductions and journal articles, she increasingly found herself at odds with the regime of Nicolae Ceaușescu. By the 1970s, she considered Ceausescu's regime to be "fascist" as she was disgusted by the anti-intellecualism of the Ceausescu regime. 
The American scholar Brett Bowles noted that the crucial role played by women in the Resistance has tended to be overlooked, giving the example of the 1985 French documentary "Des terroristes à la retraite" ("Terrorists in Retirement") by Mosco Boucault about the FTP-MOI. Bowles noted that in the film, there was almost no mention of the women who served in the FTP-MOI and Boico, despite her key role as the FTP-MOI intelligence chief, was mentioned only once in passing. Buico was not interviewed for "Des terroristes à la retraite"; indeed the only woman interviewed in the film was Mélinée Manouchian and the interviews with her the focus was mostly on being the wife of Missak Manouchian instead of her role as a "résistante". 
In 1987, she left Romania to visit her children in Paris and chose not to return. She began publishing again in France and wrote such works as "Les Hommes qui ont porté Ceaușescu au pouvoir", which has been called by Vladimir Tismăneanu "the most comprehensive and illuminating analysis" of the rise of Ceaușescu and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej to the leadership of the Romanian Communist Party. Her major concern in the last years of her life was writing about the Holocaust in Romania and to rebut the attempts, which had started under the Ceaușescu regime in the 1970s, to portray Antonescu as a well meaning, but misguided Romanian patriot who was opposed to the Holocaust. She often advised the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C about the subject. At the time of her death she was writing a memoir entitled "Histoire d’une famille au XXème siècle Souvenirs et réflexions".
Death and legacy.
Boico died on 17 August 2002 in Paris. In 2009, the French novelist Didier Daeninckx published a novel "Missak", where Luca Boico is mentioned several times as the book's hero, the journalist Dragère, seeks in 1955 to find out who betrayed Manouchian. In 2014, a French miniseries, "Résistance", was released about the young people involved in the French Resistance during the war. One of the characters in the series was based on Boico's experiences and was played by Romanian actress Cristina Flutur.

Gentiana pannonica

Gentiana pannonica, the brown gentian or Hungarian gentian (, "Pannonischer Enzian", "Ungarischer Enzian" or "Ungarn-Enzian"), is a species of flowering plant of the genus "Gentiana" in the family of Gentianaceae.
Description.
Description.
The Hungarian gentian is a perennial, herbaceous plant, which grows to a height of 20 to 60 centimetres. All the above-ground parts of the plant are hairless. Its stem is upright and strong.
The five to seven-veined leaves are decussate. The lower leaves are petiolate and elliptic in shape; the upper ones are sessile and lanceolate.
The Hungarian gentian flowers from July to September. Its flowers are located in the upper leaf axils or grouped at the end of the stem.
The hermaphroditic flowers are radially symmetrical with double perianths. The green sepals are fused. The calyx is bell-shaped and has five to eight outward curving teeth. The bell-shaped corolla is 25 to 50 millimetres long. It is wider at the top and, towards the middle, has five to nine petals. The corolla tip is ovate. On their outer side, the petals are red and violet with black and red spots, the inside is usually yellowish.
Its chromosome count is 2n = 40.
Taxonomy.
The first publication of "Gentiana pannonica" was by Giovanni Antonio Scopoli. The species epithet "pannonica" derives from the Roman province of Pannonia. Synonyms for "Gentiana pannonica" SCOP. are: "Gentiana semifida" HOFFMANSS. EX RCHB. and "Coilantha pannonica" G.DON.
Similar species.
The Hungarian gentian is very similar to the purple gentian ("Gentiana purpurea").
Distribution and habitat.
Range.
The Hungarian gentian is found in the Eastern Alps, Bergamasque Alps, Carpathians and Transylvania. The western boundary of the gentian (Allgäu, eastern Switzerland) is coincident with the eastern boundary of the purple gentian.
In Austria the Hungarian gentian is scattered to moderately common (e.g. on the Krippenstein/Dachstein). It does not occur in Vienna or the Burgenland. In Germany it occurs in the alms of the Bavarian Forest, including within the Bavarian Forest National Park.
Habitat.
The Hungarian gentian thrives best on calcareous soil, but also on soils poor in calcium. It occurs in Central Europe in perennial meadows and cirques, bogs and mountain pine bush. The Hungarian gentian is a character species of the Nardion community, but also occurs in plant communities of the sub-group rhododendro-vaccinienion.
Uses and conservation.
The Hungarian gentian is an old medicinal herb and is used like the yellow gentian. Because it was intensively used in former times, its stocks shrank to just small residual populations. As a result the IUCN placed it in the "near threatened" category. For the conservation of this species habitat management plans were created or adjusted.

Mariccus

Mariccus (d. 69) was a Gallic Boian leader who lived in the mid 1st century AD and led a failed revolt against Roman rule.
According to Tacitus, in 68 AD the lowly born Mariccus declared himself a god and the champion of Gaul. He gathered an army of about 8.000 men, but his revolt was put down by the Aeduan tribal militia and some cohorts of Roman auxiliaries which were sent to aid them. Mariccus was captured and sentenced to death. In 69 AD in the attendance of Vitellius he was thrown to the wild animals in the arena but the beasts refused to attack him. Vitellius then ordered his execution “by more practical means”.

General Post Office, Patna

The General Post Office, Patna (abbreviation GPO, commonly known as the Patna GPO) is a British Raj building located in Patna, Bihar, India. It is the central post office of the city of Patna and the headquarters of India Post's Bihar Circle. It is located on the intersection of Buddh Marg and New Market Station Road. The post office handles most of the city's inbound and outbound mails and parcels. As of 2017, GPO Patna delivers 1 lakh letters and parcels daily through 96 postmen. It also has more than 12 lakh savings accounts.
The building was designed by New Zealand-born architect Joseph Fearis Munnings. The GPO campus also houses the office of the Chief Postmaster General for Bihar Circle. The construction of building started in 1912 and was completed in 1917. The building was opened to public in 1917 and was then known as Post and Telegraph Office. The building was part of the New Patna that British established in 1912 after the division of Bihar and Orissa from Bengal Presidency. The post office celebrated its centenary year in 2017.
History.
At the Delhi Durbar of 1911 King George V announced the creation of a new province of Bihar and Orissa under a lieutenant-governor. British decided Patna to be the capital of the new province. With this came the need to establish government offices and buildings such as the Patna Secretariat, Raj Bhavan (Bihar), Patna University campus, Patna High Court, Post and Telegraph Office.
Munnings was appointed as Consulting Architect to the Government of Bihar and Orissa in the year 1912 and was tasked with the planning and development of New Patna. Lord Hardinge laid the stone of new buildings in Patna on 1 December 1912. The construction of the building started in 1912 and was completed in 1917. It was opened for the public on 1 July 1917 with 17 employees in total and was built over an area of 22 acres.
Patna GPO when built was known as Post and Telegraph Office. It was however, not the first post office in Patna. The first post office in official records of Patna was near Anisabad area. This post office was later shifted to Bankipore, 150 metres away from the current GPO building. When the GPO building was constructed, the Bankipore post office moved to Muradabad area on Ashok Rajpath. The first post office of the province of Bihar and Orissa was opened near Hazaribagh - now part of the state of Jharkhand.
Building and architecture.
The post and telegraph office, Patna was built in Gothic Revival architectural style. J.F. Munnings was the main architect on the project and was influenced by choice of local materials and plain designs. These constraints were also practical in nature as it was the time when World War I was waging and British Empire was one of the main belligerents of the allied powers. This led to the plain designs of the building as the empire was spending more on war efforts.
The building is a flat roofed, plastered brick building featuring Chhajja. The building also has Mughal features as when built, it was located on the edge of the old city of Patna and was on the road leading from old city to the new capital city of Patna. It also features an arcade.
The original structure had three porticoes - north, south and east. East portico functioned as the main entrance. The western flank was added later. The ground floor has seven rooms and four halls with counter areas. The first floor houses 14 halls which are quite huge in size. The chief postmaster's office is now located in the central portion, while the deputy postmaster's office is located underneath it.
The building was renovated in the year 2000 at a cost of INR 1.25 crore. The renovation also added five gardens, including one having medicinal herbs to the campus.
Location.
Patna GPO is located in Beer Chand Patel Path locality of Patna. The main building is located on the intersection of Buddh Marg and New Market Station Road. The main portico of the building faces in the south east direction. GPO is less than 1 km from Patna Junction and around 6 km from Patna Airport. Hardinge Park is located on west side of the GPO campus.
Current use.
Patna GPO currently serves as the main post office of the city of Patna and is also the head office of Bihar circle of India Post. The area of the building is around 2.5 lakh sq ft and houses almost 296 employees. One multipurpose hall on ground floor houses the counters of all the mail and booking services. The other three halls on ground floor deal with financial services, staff and philately. A separate area for 96 postmen is housed in seven other rooms on the same floor in the southern flank. Mail, delivery and parcel sections are also present in the same section. There are separate counters for senior citizens and students in the northern side of the building.

McKeel Hagerty

McKeel Hagerty, born December 9, 1967, is the CEO of Hagerty, a specialty provider of classic car insurance headquartered in Traverse City, Michigan. He is a Co-Founder and General Partner at Grand Rapids, Michigan-based venture capital firm Grand Ventures. He was the global board chairman for the Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) from 2016 to 2017.
Early life.
In 1983, McKeel’s parents, Frank and Louise Hagerty, started Hagerty Insurance Agency in Traverse City, Mich. with a focus on collector wooden boats. That same year, McKeel finished a three-year restoration of his first car with his father – a 1967 Porsche 911S. McKeel started the restoration at the age of 13 with $500 in lawn mowing money that he had saved.
By 18 years of age, McKeel earned his insurance license and was selling marine craft policies.
He had not planned on going into the family insurance business, studying philosophy and Russian Orthodox theology in the seminary. McKeel holds BA in English and Philosophy from Pepperdine University in 1990, MA in Theology from Saint Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary in 1993 and studied graduate work at Boston College in Philosophy and Classic until 1995.
In 1995, McKeel returned to Traverse City to take over the company with his sister Kim, expanding the company’s focus beyond wooden boats and into classic and collector cars.
Career.
In 1995, McKeel led the company as its vice president. In 2000, McKeel became the CEO of Hagerty Insurance Agency, and he was first among classic car insurers to embrace the internet for online quoting and policy management. That same year, he began serving as a judge at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance for the Federation Internationale des Vehicles Anciens (FIVA) preservation class and was the youngest person ever to be asked to serve in such a role.
In an effort to preserve historic vehicles and related artifacts as a lasting record, McKeel created the Historic Vehicle Association (HVA) in 2009, and in March 2013, the HVA entered into a collaboration with the U.S. Department of the Interior to develop the National Historic Vehicle Register.
McKeel was presented with the Nicola Bulgari Award from America's Car Museum in 2014 for his outstanding contributions to preserving cars through education, restoration and collecting.
In 2016, McKeel was elected by his peers to serve as global board chairman for Young Presidents' Organization (YPO) – the world’s largest CEO organization whose members run companies that employ 16 million people and generate $6 trillion in annual revenues. McKeel co-founded venture capital firm Grand Ventures in 2017, and launched DriveShare by Hagerty, the nation's only peer-to-peer classic vehicle rental marketplace that same year.

Vagina Museum

The Vagina Museum is the world's first bricks and mortar museum about the female reproductive system. The project is based in the United Kingdom, and moved into its first fixed location in Camden Market, London, in October 2019. Its first exhibition opened on 16 November 2019.
Description.
The Vagina Museum was founded in response to a lack of female representation within the culture and heritage sector throughout the world. The museum hosts two temporary exhibitions per year which will explore a multitude of topics surrounding women's health, social history, activism and discourse, as well as an events programme of talks, workshops, comedy, theatre and performance art.
History.
The project to create the Vagina Museum was launched when the founder, Florence Schechter, discovered there was a penis museum in Iceland, the Icelandic Phallological Museum, but there was no equivalent for the vagina or vulva.
2017–2018.
The Museum's first event, a comedy fundraiser, was held on 19 May 2017 headlined by Hayley Ellis. It has run a number of events since, including participating in a residency with The Mothership Group called Superculture. Events as part of this residency have included a talk on "Vulvanomics" by Emma L. E. Rees, author of "The Vagina: A Literary and Cultural History", and a screening of the film "Teeth" (see "vagina dentata") followed by a Q&amp;A with Amanda DiGioia, the author of "Childbirth and Parenting in Horror Texts: The Marginalized and the Monstrous" and various comedy nights. They have also done events at Limmud Festival 2017 and the Royal Institution.
The Museum held its first exhibition in August 2017 in Edinburgh, Scotland. Its second pop up exhibition was called "Is Your Vagina Normal?", and it travelled around the UK to Ancient House, Thetford, Brainchild Festival 2018, SQIFF 2018, and Museums Association Conference 2018.
In the 2017 Women of the Future Awards, Schechter was commended in the arts and culture category for her work with the Vagina Museum.
The permanent museum will have exhibitions on female anatomy from science to art to culture. The museum will be trans-inclusive.
2019: Crowdfunding campaign and Camden Market premises.
On 21 March 2019, the Vagina Museum launched a crowdfunder to raise money to open a premises in Camden Market.
The project is supported by Camden Council, and leader of Camden Council Georgia Gould says: “Camden has a proud and radical history of challenging prejudice and orthodoxy, however, we acknowledge that the stigma associated with talking about gynaecological health has meant ignorance, confusion, shame, and poor medical care for too many. 65% of 16-to-25 year olds say they have a problem using the word vagina or vulva with almost half of 18-to-24 year old women say they are too embarrassed to talk about sexual health issues. We are therefore incredibly excited that the Vagina Museum is seeking to establish in Camden, and hope that it is funded to provide an inclusive and intersectional centre for learning, creativity, activism, and outreach that will add immeasurably to our collective understanding of our bodies.”The crowdfunder raised £48,945 and in October 2019, the museum moved into Camden Stables Market and began a programme of events. It opened its first exhibition, "Muff Busters: vagina myths and how to fight them" in November 2019. This exhibition was scheduled to end on 29 March 2020, but closed a few days earlier due to national lockdown restrictions in the UK. The next exhibition, "Periods : a brief history" opened on 21 May 2021.
In August 2021 the museum announced that its landlord had decided not to extent its lease beyond September of that year.

Angela Zhang (scientist)

Angela Zhang (born 1994, Cupertino, California) is an Asian American scientist who in 2009, at the age of 14, began to research at Stanford University. By 2011, Zhang's research won the $100,000 Siemens Competition in Math, Science &amp; Technology, and earned her widespread notability for her research on cancer treatments with iron oxide gold nanoparticles. She graduated from Harvard in 2016, and is now at Stanford University.
Education.
While attending Monta Vista High School, Zhang was reading doctorate papers on bio-engineering and attending scientific conferences; by the age of 14, she had begun to work as a member of Stanford's research team. In the fall of 2012, Zhang attended Harvard University, where she majored in biomedical engineering and graduated in 2016, after which she returned to Stanford University to participate in the 2016 Medical Scientist Training Program.
Career and work.
During high school, Zhang worked with a Stanford graduate student to research the cancer-fighting potential of a single nanoparticle. In 2011, at age 16, she entered her cancer-killing nanoparticle research into the Siemens Competition in Math, Science &amp; Technology, where she won first prize and a $100,000 scholarship, and the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, she also won first prize. She was the only female finalist in the Siemens competition that year. The following year, at the age of 17, Zhang went to the White House and presented her research to then-President Barack Obama.
As an undergrad at Harvard, Zhang and a group of other Harvard students continued to grow her nonprofit "Labs on Wheels" concept, which she had started in 2012. It was made to provide refurbished lab equipment to American high schools. Labs on Wheel has garnered grants from Harvard and was the first place in the 2013 Harvard Undergraduate Women in Business Innovation Competition, and a finalist in the 2015 Harvard President's Challenge. Zhang presented the concept at the 2013 TEDxSan Jose.
Major contribution.
Zhang's research includes her exploration of the cancer-fighting potential of a single nanoparticle, which is known as the iron oxide gold nanoparticle. During her time at Stanford, while still in high school, Zhang and the team found that this particular nanoparticle is able to do two valuable things. It can detect cancer and the nanoparticle can deliver chemotherapy drugs more efficiently to the cells.

Background.
Incumbent Representative Louise Slaughter died at the age of 88 on March 16, 2018, after suffering a concussion earlier in the month.
Following precedent set in 2010, concurrent elections were held in November, one to fill the remainder of Slaughter's term, and the other to fill the seat for the next term. The district was left without Congressional representation until then.
Nominees for special elections are selected by the parties in the counties that comprise the congressional district. There are no primaries. The filing deadline for party nominations was August 30, 2018, and for independent petitions was September 4, 2018.
Democratic primary.
The following information pertains to the regular election for the 25th District for a full term to the 116th Congress.
General election.
Results.
As the winner of the special election, Morelle was sworn in on November 13 rather than waiting until the new Congressional term. He also won the regular election for a new two-year term beginning in January 2019.
