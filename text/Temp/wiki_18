The Ally Challenge

The Ally Challenge is a PGA Tour Champions event at Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club in Grand Blanc Township, Michigan, just south of Flint, which debuted in September 2018. The tournament is sponsored by Grand Blanc-based McLaren Health Care. Detroit-based Ally Financial is the title sponsor. Beyond the tournament, the Ally Challenge event includes a pro-am on Wednesday and Thursday, The Ally Challenge Community Concert on Friday and Adidas 5K Challenge run/walk event on Saturday morning.
Net proceeds from the tournament were earmarked for Community Foundation of Greater Flint and Junior Achievement of Southeastern Michigan plus additional charities could participate in the Birdies for Charities fundraising program. Grand Blanc Community Schools benefits by using their parking lots to generate revenue.
Background.
Previously, the area had the Buick Open from 1958 through 2009 at the Warwick Hills Golf Club, as one of six former PGA Tour sites hosting PGA Tour Champions events. Since that tournament left, the golf club had been looking to get a replace in a PGA Tour Champions event. The main issue was finding a title sponsor.
History.
The Ally Challenge was announced by the PGA on August 26, 2017 as a PGA Tour Champions tournament playing September 10–16, 2018. An agreement is in place for the $2 million purse tournament until 2020. The Challenge would also included a pro-am on Wednesday and Thursday. 
On November 10, 2017, the tournament announced McLaren Health Care as presenting sponsor. Plus, they indicated tickets were on sale, a Big &amp; Rich concert would be held after the first round and a 5K run would also be held. The Birdies for Charities fundraising program was announced in May 2018 for additional 501(c)3 charity to join. The 5K run/walk was announced on June 22, 2018 to be sponsor by Adidas as the Adidas 5K Challenge held before the second round with benefiting non-profits as the Community Foundation of Greater Flint and Junior Achievement of Southeastern Michigan.
The Genesee County Board of Commissioners embroiled the tournament in a controversy over their April 2, 2018 approval, 7–1, of using veterans millage funds towards sponsoring the event as "outreach". With the sponsorship, the county would get free access for veterans to the tournament and a "Patriot Pavilion" at the 18th fairway for all active and reserve military, veterans and their dependents. On April 9, 2018, after a commissioner sponsored petition with 500 signatures and an hour of mostly veterans speaking against the sponsorship, the board reversed it vote, initially 6–2–1 before voting switching made it unanimous. 
Paul Broadhurst was the inaugural 2018 tournament winner with a 15-under-par 201 score to beat Brandt Jobe by two strokes. All three rounds of the tournament was broadcast on the Golf Channel.
On August 2, 2020, major champion Jim Furyk won the tournament in his PGA Tour Champions debut, becoming the first golfer to have won the former Buick Open held here to win The Ally Challenge.

Neorickettsia helminthoeca

Neorickettsia helminthoeca is a bacterium in the "Neorickettsia" genus that causes Salmon poisoning disease.
Salmon poisoning disease.
Salmon poisoning disease (SPD) is a fatal disease of dogs and other canids caused by a rickettsial bacterium, "Neorickettsia helminthoeca". It results from eating raw salmon, trout, or salamander and is common in the Pacific Northwest. These fish and amphibians are infected with the larvae of a fluke, "Nanophyetus salmincola" through an intermediate host, the snail "Oxytrema plicifer". The larvae attaches to the intestine of the dog and the rickettsial bacteria are released, causing severe gastrointestinal disease and systemic infection.
"Neorickettsia elokominica", carried by the same fluke, causes a similar disease known as Elokomin fluke fever (EFF) in canids, bears, raccoons, and ferrets.
Symptoms.
Symptoms of SPD begin about one week after eating the salmon and include vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, depression, high fever, and enlarged lymph nodes. Untreated, mortality reaches 90 percent. Death occurs seven to ten days after symptoms begin.
EFF has less severe symptoms than SPD, with less gastrointestinal signs and more lymph node involvement. The mortality in untreated cases is about 10 percent.
A similar disease has been identified in Brazil.
Diagnosis.
Diagnosis is through finding the fluke eggs microscopically in a stool sample. A needle aspiration biopsy of an enlarged lymph node will reveal rickettsial organisms within macrophages in many cases. The rickettsial infection can be successfully treated with tetracycline, and the fluke infection can be treated with fenbendazole.

Better Life Programme for Rural Women

The Better Life Programme for Rural Women or BLP was a project in Nigeria started in September 1987 by Maryam Babangida, the wife of President Ibrahim Babangida. The programme was discontinued after a change in government. The idea of BLP originated at a workshop organized by Maryam Babangida with the scope of discussing the relegation of rural women in discourse affecting national development and the invisibility of positive actions towards causes favoring rural women. When the project started, the objectives were to reduce maternal and child mortality rate by increasing basic healthcare facilities for women, provide income-generating opportunities in agriculture and cottage industries, integrate rural women into national development plans and develop educational training for women.
However, the programme provoked criticism because funds allocated to many projects were unaccounted for largely because there was no budgetary allocation to fund BLP. Access to government funds by a first lady was challenged as unconstitutional and some critics view the project as a means to increase the personality of the first lady.
The Programme.
Prior to the launch of Better Life, Maryam Babangida held consultations with various stakeholders such as the Directorate for Food and Rural Infrastructure and women organizations about economic and social constraints affecting rural women. In 1986, she visited two villages close to Lagos, Igbologun and Ilado-Odo. The villages did not have clean water and power distribution infrastructure. The visit confirmed her understanding that more actions should be directed towards rural development. In 1987, a workshop on the role of rural women in development was held in Abuja and led to the establishment of BLP.
Projects.
BLP focused on key areas of nutrition, education, agriculture.
Agriculture.
BLP created strategies that mobilized some rural women farmers to produce affordable food crops that has nutritional and national development values such as Cassava for starch production and grain produce. Women farmers were encouraged to unite under cooperative societies to increase access to credit and land grants, extension services and technology.
The programme introduced basic farm and mechanized inputs such as cutlasses and subsidized tractor for hire service. Food processing machines were also made available to women farmers.
Education.
A strategy to increase literacy and the agriculture know-how of rural women was adult literacy programmes tailored to functional and vocational subject areas such as dress making, knitting and mathematics.
Healthcare.
BLP mobilized the provision of primary health care centers close to rural settlements. It mobilized women to get immunizations, established small pharmacies and trained mid-wives and provided VVF centers. The programme was also involved in extending family planning services to rural women and providing education about health and safety issues concerning child marriage and sexually transmitted diseases.
Organizational structure.
After the launch of BLP, wives of military governors were tasked to understand the plight of rural women in their specific states and create projects that will benefit rural women and linking such projects to the appropriate state ministry. A committee under the headship of the wife of the military governor, that included a director-general and leading female government employees managed and implemented BLP projects in each state.
From 1987 to 1993, BLP did not legally have access to any budgetary allocation and critics queried the source of funding for many of its projects. Many wives of governors advertised their projects in newspapers and when attending conferences stayed at choice hotels. Many of these actions provoked a debate about the constitutional authority of a wife of a military president and access to state funds.

Lombardic capitals

Lombardic capitals is the name given to a type of decorative upper-case letters used in inscriptions and, typically, at the start of a section of text in medieval manuscripts. They are characterized by their rounded forms with thick, curved stems. Paul Shaw describes the style as a "relative" of uncial writing. 
Unlike Gothic capitals, Lombardic capitals were also used to write words or entire phrases. They were used both in illuminated manuscripts and monumental inscriptions, like the bell tower of Santa Chiara, Naples. In Italian, the style is known as "Longobarda" after an earlier spelling of the Lombardy region.
History.
The term "Lombardic" comes from the study of incunabula. A characteristic form of text decoration in manuscripts and early printed books with hand colouring was to use alternating red and blue Lombardic capitals for the start of each successive paragraph.
Unlike historiated or inhabited initials, Lombardic capitals are devoid of further decoration.
In modern times, fonts of Lombardic capitals have been designed by many typographers, such as Frederic Goudy, who included a set as an alternative uppercase for his Goudy Text font.

The New Castle Historic Commercial District in New Castle, Delaware is a historic district which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016.
The listed area includes 29 contributing buildings. It includes the Italianate-style Henry County Courthouse, which was separately listed on the National Register in 1977.
New Castle's historic center is somewhat different from those of other Kentucky county seat towns, as it never had a railroad. Railroads reached most county seats by around 1920 and shaped development significantly. Most of the contributing buildings in the district are one- or two-story brick structures; three are log buildings.

SMS V189

SMS "V189" was a "S-138"-class large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by the AG Vulcan shipyard at Stettin between 1910 and 1911 and launched on 14 March 1911.
She served throughout the First World War, being present at the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914 and the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916. She was renamed "T189" in February 1918. After the war, she was allocated to Great Britain as a war reparation, but ran aground in December 1920 and was scrapped.
Construction and design.
The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ("V186"–"V191") ordered from AG Vulcan and the other six ships from Germaniawerft. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders.
"V189" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load.
Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 136 tons of coal and 67 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at .
The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the Forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two on the ship's beam in the gap between the forecastle and the ship's bridge which were capable of firing straight ahead, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.
"V189" was laid down at AG Vulcan's Stettin shipyard as Yard number 307 and was launched on 14 March 1911 and completed on 30 June 1911.
Service.
First World War.
On 28 August 1914, the British Harwich Force, supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. The German defensive patrols around Heligoland consisted of one flotilla (I Torpedo Flotilla) of 12 modern torpedo boats forming an outer patrol line about North and West of Heligoland, with an inner line of older torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division at about . Four German light cruisers and another flotilla of torpedo boats (V Torpedo Boat Flotilla) was in the vicinity of Heligoland. "V189 ", a member of the 2nd Half Flotilla of I Torpedo Boat Flotilla, formed part of the outer screen of torpedo boats, being the southernmost ship in the formation. At about 06:00 on 28 August, , another member of the outer screen reported spotting the periscope of a submarine. As a result, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla was ordered out to hunt the hostile submarine. At 07:57 "G194" was fired on by British warships, and was soon retreating towards Heligoland, pursued by four British destroyers. V Flotilla and the old torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division also came under British fire, and were only saved by the intervention of the German cruisers and , with the torpedo boats , and "T33" damaged. "V189" managed to successfully avoid the British ships and returned to base. However, sister ship , leader of I Flotilla, ran into the midst of the Harwich force when trying to return to Heligoland and was sunk.

Hodmedod's

Hodmedod Ltd or Hodmedod's is a British food retail and production company founded in 2012 and based in Brampton in Suffolk. They specialise in British-grown pulses, grains and seeds. The company grew out of the Norwich Resilient Food Project, a community initiative initiated by Transition City Norwich which asked whether a small city could feed itself and, if so, how diets and landuse might need to change.
In 2014 they launched a range of three kinds of tinned British-grown fava beans, and in 2017 they grew a commercial-scale crop of lentils, having been told that this was impossible in the British climate.
In 2016 their organic quinoa, developed in Essex and grown in Suffolk, won "Delicious" magazine's produce award in the "From the earth (primary)" category.
In 2017 they won the BBC Food &amp; Farming Award "Best Food Producers" category. 
In late 2019 they became the first company to offer British grown Chickpeas for sale in the UK.
Name and logo.
The company logo shows a hedgehog. On the company website it is stated that "Hodmedod" is an East Anglian word for variously a hedgehog, a snail, an ammonite or curls in a girl's hair: all things small and curled up and thus possibly including beans and peas. "We chose the word for the name of our business simply because we like the sound of it, and feel that it reflects our East Anglian backgrounds and represents part of our forgotten heritage, a bit like the fava bean or black badger peas". It is also a Berkshire word for a scarecrow.

Richmond Hotel

The Richmond Hotel is a historic building located in the LaVilla neighborhood of Jacksonville, Florida. The building was originally built in 1909 as a hotel for Black patrons. Following desegregation, the hotel closed in 1969. As of 2018, the ground-level area of the Richmond Hotel is occupied by Delo Studios.
Summary.
The Richmond Hotel is situated on the corner of N Broad Street and West Church Street, adjacent to the Duval County Courthouse. It is located in the northwest quadrant of Downtown. Specifically the hotel can be found in the northwest corner of the LaVilla neighborhood, a historic African-American neighborhood that is east of I-95 and south of W Union Street.
The Richmond Hotel is a 3-story structure, situated on .22 acres of land. There is now a .07 acre lot behind the building. The entire building spans 17,620 square feet. The second story balcony could be used to oversee the street below.
"Jacksonville's Architectural Heritage" cites a 1942 magazine describing the Richmond Hotel as an:"[O]utstanding hotel for colored people in Jacksonville...[located] close to all principal Negro businesses, theaters, and churches, and less than five minutes drive from the railroad terminal. Most of its 38 rooms have running water, with many bathrooms adjacent. The Richmond Hotel boasts a quiet, homelike atmosphere. A Tea Room is operated for the convenience of guests" (p. 97). 
History.
Originally built in 1909, the Richmond Hotel operated as the hub for prominent black residents and celebrities to stay during the time. At the time it was the only black-only hotel in the area. Compared to other segregated places, the Richmond Hotel was of a premier quality at the time. It was a popular destination at the time for famous African-American artists such as Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, and Billie Holiday.
As a result of desegregation, the hotel closed its doors to the public in 1969. Thereafter, it was utilized for retail purposes. Following the forlorn times of segregation, the hotel's business progressively died to the point where it is now essentially abandoned. For some time throughout the 70s and 80s, various retail stores were placed on the ground-level floor of the building. The upper two levels were reserved as boarding houses rented out to locals.
Perhaps the most popular retail store located in the hotel was the DeLoach Furniture Co., a family-owned furniture store that served Jacksonville for over 90 years prior to its closing in the mid 2010s.
Throughout the 1990s, demolition derby parties were held throughout the Downtown area, including LaVilla. While The Blue Chip (another hotel for African-American guests in LaVilla) did not survive demolition, the Richmond Hotel did. The former site of the Blue Chip is now a vacant lot.
Currently, the Richmond Hotel operates under the name Delo Studios, a multi-use space for meetings and events, galleries, and photography studios.
Features.
Harlem of the South.
Throughout the 1920s until the 1960s, LaVilla was known as the "Harlem of the South" due to its bursting creativity. The neighborhood was notorious for its many theaters such as the Ritz Theatre, the Strande Theatre, and the Roosevelt Theatre. Likewise, many nightclubs and diners lit up the streets after dark, including Hayes Luncheonette, Mama's Restaurant, Nick's Pool Parlor, and Manuel's Taproom. When guests would come to visit the theaters and clubs, they would stay in nearby hotels, such as the Richmond Hotel (renamed Egmont Hotel) and Hotel de Dreme (renamed in the 1920s as the Wynn Hotel).
The most prominent area of LaVilla for bohemians was Ashley Street. Due to the Richmond Hotel's location to Ashley Street, the hotel was once a popular place to stay for many famous and affluent people.
The Great Fire of 1901.
It is possible that the success of the Richmond Hotel (and more largely, Ashley Street) can be attributed to the Great Fire of 1901. On May 3, 1901, a fire erupted in LaVilla, lasting 8 hours and burning up 146 city blocks. The fire destroyed over 2,300 buildings and left nearly 10,000 residents without homes.
The fire began at a candle factory on the corner of Ashley and Davis Streets, spreading to the St. Johns River.
James Weldon Johnson, a principal of a local school claimed that local firemen only attempted to save white neighborhoods, leaving the prominently black portions of town in flames: "We met many people fleeing. From them we gathered excitedly related snatches: the fiber factory catches afire - the fire department comes - fanned by a light breeze, the fire is traveling directly east and spreading out to the north, over the district where the bulk of Negroes in the western end of the city live - the firemen spend all their efforts saving a low row of frame houses just across the street on the south side of the factory, belonging to a white man named Steve Melton."After the fire ended, multiple noted architects helped to rebuild the city. Henry J. Klutho of New York was significant in the redevelopment of the downtown area, though he is not attributed to the Richmond Hotel. Due to reconstruction efforts by those like Klutho, various apartments buildings, office spaces, churches, and libraries were built throughout LaVilla and the surrounding downtown neighborhoods.

James Reynolds (Irish politician)

James Reynolds (born 7 December 1968) is an Irish farmer, nationalist and far-right politician who has served as vice president of the National Party since 2016. Reynolds was active in farming politics, serving as chairman of the Longford branch of the Irish Farmers' Association (IFA) from 1999 to 2003 and subsequently as treasurer of the Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association (ICSA) until 2017. He co-founded the National Party with Justin Barrett in November 2016. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the party at the 2020 Irish general election, standing in the Longford-Westmeath constituency.
Farming activism.
Irish Farmers' Association.
Reynolds was elected chairman of Longford IFA branch in 1999, a position which he held until 2003. He then chaired his local Ballinalee IFA branch. He was a staunch critic of IFA president Pádraig Walshe. At the 2006 Ploughing Championships in Tullow, Reynolds organised up to twenty posters depicting Walshe with then-Minister for Agriculture Mary Coughlan in his arms with the words "Beet this" printed above them to be placed at various routes to the ploughing site. This referred to Walshe's alleged role in the demise of the Irish sugar industry.
In 2009 Reynolds and other disgruntled IFA farmers formed Farmers For No to oppose the second Lisbon Treaty referendum. They claimed the Lisbon Treaty would fast-track Turkey's application to join the EU, which would "double the number of farmers overnight" and cause Common Agricultural Policy payments to collapse. They further claimed that the passage of the Treaty would "jeopardise" farm succession rights. The second Lisbon Treaty referendum subsequently passed by a margin of 67% to 33%.
Farmers For No was revived in 2012 to oppose the Fiscal Compact treaty in that year's referendum. Reynolds caused a stir on an episode of RTÉ's "Frontline" debating the Treaty, in which he provoked the host Pat Kenny by suggesting that a Yes vote would "shut down rural Ireland" to which Kenny responded, "come on James, get a life." The incident prompted Reynolds to be labelled "a YouTube sensation" by the "Irish Times."
He was suspended by the IFA in 2012 for bringing the county executive "into disrepute".
Irish Cattle and Sheep Farmers' Association.
In 2014, he was elected for a two-year term as national treasurer of the ICSA, having previously served as its secretary. During his time as ICSA treasurer he said the organisation was "unique in being the only farm organisation to call for the appointment of an EU-wide regulator for the meat industry".
In response to Reynolds' role in co-founding the National Party he was removed from his position as national treasurer of the ICSA by a vote of no confidence passed by the organisation's executive. Reynolds rejected the legitimacy of the executive's decision to expel him and said he believes he should not be discriminated against for his political views. He launched an appeal against the decision to remove him as national treasurer. Justice Robert Haughton granted Reynolds a temporary injunction preventing the ICSA from removing him from his position. Ultimately, the High Court ruled in favour of the ICSA against Reynolds and his expulsion was confirmed. The ICSA also objected to Reynolds' "gratuitously offensive comments made about the former Taoiseach Enda Kenny, the EU Commissioner and other politicians".
Political activism.
During the 1990s Reynolds was a prominent member of the hardline anti-abortion group Youth Defence. In an 1992 interview with Hot Press Reynolds spoke of abandoning democracy and argued for the inductment of internment and the reintroduction of the death penalty to Ireland. The same article featured a conversation between Reynolds and another member of Youth Defence in which Reynolds "recalled Mussolini with fondness" but chided Francisco Franco for "allowing ‘commies and socialists’ into his government towards the end”. During the same time period, Reynolds stated in an interview with Shannonside radio that if Nuala Fennell and Nora Owen of Fine Gael been active politically in Spain in the 1970s like they were in Ireland in the 1990s, "they would have been put up against a wall and shot". 
Reynolds contested the Longford County Council election in 2004 as an independent, leaving his post of Longford IFA chairman to do so. He received 231 first preference votes and failed to be elected, being eliminated on the fourth count. The same year Justin Barrett campaigned unsuccessfully for a seat in the European Parliament.
In 2009, Reynolds became chairman of the Longford branch of Libertas Ireland, a political party founded by Declan Ganley. Reynolds campaigned on behalf of Ganley's unsuccessful attempt to be elected an MEP. In November 2009, Libertas Ireland was removed from the Register of Political Parties in Ireland.
Reynolds' next foray into politics was as chair of the eurosceptic Farmers For No campaign, established to oppose the 2009 Lisbon Treaty referendum. The group was briefly revived to oppose the 2012 Compact Fiscal referendum, Reynolds claimed the treaty would put the Common Agricultural Policy budget "at severe risk".
In November 2016 he helped to co-found the National Party and assumed the post of vice president of the new party. Reynolds has spoken at a number of National Party events since the party's launch, including alongside Barrett who has described Reynolds as a "friend for many years". At the party's first ardfheis, guest speaker John Wilson walked out in reaction to homophobic comments, including a claim by Reynolds that LGBT people were "mentally disordered".
In June 2019, Reynolds accompanied anti-immigration and conspiracy-theorist campaigner Gemma O'Doherty for a livestream in Longford, during which a Polish woman living in the town confronted the pair outside St. Mel's Cathedral. Reynolds subsequently spoke in O'Doherty's favour during protests held outside Google's Dublin headquarters following her suspension from YouTube. Local independent County Councillor Turlough McGovern denied political association with Reynolds after the county council elections in 2019, when Reynolds was photographed celebrating with him. McGovern has since denied support of or by Reynolds and that any involvement from Reynolds was "in a personal capacity".
Reynolds was an unsuccessful candidate in Longford-Westmeath in the 2020 general election, garnering 983 first preference votes (1.74%).

Ma-con

ma-con is a German motor racing team. It was founded in 2001 by Marian Hamprecht. The team started racing in the Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup and Formula Renault 2000 Germany in 2002. Currently the team competes in the FIA Formula 3 European Championship. The team always focussed on regional and continental championships in Germany and Europe.
Over time, the team entered using different names, namely ma-con Motorsport, ma-con Racing and ma-con Engineering alongside the common ma-con name. For the 2011 ADAC Formel Masters season the team run a second entry named Krafft Walzen.
History.
Founded in 2001 by successful German F3 team manager Marian Hamprecht, the team run in multiple Formula 1 feeder series and gained multiple success in the lower categories of open-wheel racing. After an early campaign in the 2002 and 2003 Formula Renault 2000 Eurocup seasons, the team bought out the Den Blå Avis outfit and thus appeared on the grid of the 2004 FIA F3000 Championship. Despite finishing third in the team's standings in their rookie season and pushing series veteran Tomáš Enge to fourth in the driver's championship, the team discontinued their entry and rather supported Enge's 2005 IRL entry, while joining the Italian F3000 grid with an all-Czech team. Despite even more success in the Italian F3000, the team took a break from racing after 2005.
In 2008 the team joined the ADAC Formel Masters to built up a junior team spanning different tiers of feeder series, leading into the graduation of André Rudersdorf and Sven Müller within their team onto higher levels of open-wheel racing.
In order to re-gain momentum of their 2012 FIA Formula 3 European Championship campaign the team closed down their ADAC Formel Masters operation despite one driver's and one team's title. The team signed British drivers Emil Bernstorff and Tom Blomqvist. Blomqvist had two podiums, while Bernstorff had only one. The team finished fourth in the teams' championship of 2012 Formula 3 Euro Series. The team also participated with Rudersdorf in Austrian Formula 3 Cup and in the Trophy Class of the German Formula Three Championship. He won both titles.
This, however, didn't bring the success the team hoped for and stopped operating after the 2013 season. The team operated Christopher Höher's car in the Most round of the 2015 Remus F3 Cup in order to test Oreca F3 engine in the race conditions. He took one podium, but it was the only weekend for the ma-con crew, as in the Brno round Höher returned to Franz Wöss Racing's Dallara F308 Opel-Spiess.
In 2018 ma-con made the announcement to re-join FIA Formula 3 European Championship with German driver Julian Hanses after four-year break.

Beat the World

Beat the World (also known as You Got Served: Beat the World) is a 2011 Canadian dance film written and directed by Robert Adetuyi. It is a loose sequel to the American film "You Got Served" (2004). It was produced by InnerCity Films and Telefilm Canada - Equity Investment Program. The film stars Tyrone Brown, Mishael Morgan, Nikki Grant, Kristy Flores Christian Mio Loclair and Parkour artist Chase Armitage. The plot involves three dance crews from around the world preparing to do battle at the international Beat the World competition in Detroit, Michigan.
In the United States, the film was released straight-to-video on June 21, 2011 by Sony Home Entertainment, but it did receive a theatrical release in international territories, grossing a total of $933,540.
Premise.
Three dance crews prepare to do battle at the international Beat the World competition in Detroit. During the final showdown to become world champions, lifelong hopes, dreams and even lives, are at stake.
Soundtrack.
The original soundtrack was produced by Frank Fitzpatrick and released on Hip Hop Connect, an independent label and production company specializing in socially conscious rap, hip hop and film soundtracks. 
A portion of the proceeds were donated to the Debbie Allen Dance Academy through EarthTones.
Reception.
Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes shows five critic reviews with a tomatometer rating of 0% rotten with an average critic score of 3.4/10.
Paula Citron of The Globe and Mail found the film to be predictable and the dance sequences to be over-edited, commenting: "... if the audience is not there for the story - which is clearly just a hat to hang the dance on - they must be there for the dance. Unfortunately, because Adetuyi's film is actually one very long music video, the dance portions are shot in 30-second bites, so one never gets a sense of an entire routine. All we get is fast-cut teasers."
In his review for NOW Toronto, Norman Wilner criticised the acting skills of the accomplished dancers and found the plot to be hackneyed, concluding:" ... It's all just atrociously acted filler between the dance sequences, which Adetuyi shoots so haphazardly that it's impossible to appreciate the artists or choreography."
Bruce DeMara, reviewing for the Toronto Star found the plot, dialogue and theme of beating the world to be clichéd. He praised the dance performances but criticised their editing. He concluded:
" ... there are a couple of decent performances that shine through, notably Brown as Yuson and Ray Johnson as his friend, Easy, both of whom have solid onscreen presence but need a better film to demonstrate it in. Adetuyi has the makings of a decent filmmaker. He just needs to stick to the basics: believable dialogue and characters and a storyline that takes a few chances."

Tawnagh

Tawnagh () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. 
Geography.
Tawnagh is bounded on the west by Derrynacreeve, Derryvahan and Scrabby, Corlough townlands and on the east by Gortullaghan, Prospect, Corlough and Mullaghlea townlands. Its chief geographical features are small streams, spring wells and dug wells. Tawnagh is traversed by the L5028 public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 150 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Tawnagh was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Cloinelogh" (alias 'Bally Cloynelough'). The original Irish is "Baile Cluain Loch", meaning 'The Town of the Lake Meadow').
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of "Gortatawill". (Irish name, either Gort an Tuathail meaning 'The Field facing away from the Sun' or Gort an Eochaille meaning "The Field of the Yew Wood".)
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts Tawnagh as "Dawnagh".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 29 April 1611, King James VI and I granted "the town and lands of Gortatowill containing 6 polls, comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to Mulmore McHugh McFarrall O'Rely, gent". Mulmore O'Reilly had been dispossessed of his lands in the townland of Aghaweely Lower in the parish of Ballintemple. He was the grandson of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Fearghal mac Seaán, who ruled East Breifne from 1526–1534. His genealogy is "Maol Mórdha son of Aodh son of Fearghal son of Seaán son of Cathal son of Eóghan na Fésóige". Mulmore O'Reilly had four sons by his wife Honora- Émonn, Hugh O'Reilly (Archbishop of Armagh) (b. 1580, d. 1653), Fearghal and Domhnall. He also had an illegitimate son, Cathaoir. Mulmore died sometime between 1611 and 1637. He left his lands in Tawnagh to his son Émonn (Edmund) O'Reilly. Émonn had three sons, Aodh (Hugh), Cathal and Brian. An Inquisition held in Cavan Town on 12 September 1638 found that the said "Edm’ Relly recently of Gortetowell in Co. Cavan, in his life, was seised of a poll of land called Tawnagh, and of a poll called Carrick in said county. The said Edmund died on 29 September 1637. Hugh O’Reyly, his son and heir has reached his maturity and now holds the land from the king in free and common socage. Catherine Newgent, alias Reily, was the wife of the said Edmund and the aforesaid Catherine is dower of the premises." At the outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 Hugh O'Reilly still held the townland according to the Books of Survey and Distribution. Hugh O'Reilly had two sons, Émonn and Phillip. Hugh's son Émonn had one son Sémus.
The aforesaid O’Reilly lands in Tawnagh were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652. In 1657 "A list of the Papist Proprietors names in the County of Cavan, as they are returned in the Civill Surveys of the said County" gave the names of 20 landowners whose property was confiscated in the barony of Tullyhaw. These included Hugh O'Rely whose lands were distributed as follows-
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there were seven taxpayers in "Gartetoill- Thomas Magawran of Gartetoill, John Graham of the same, Tirlagh McKelagher of the same, Hugh McBrien of the same, Owen McKelacher of the same, Edmond O Helicke of the same and Hugh McGawran of the same".
A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, the lands of "Downagh". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of "Downagh" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford". Beresford then leased the land to John Graham. On 13 March 1706 Marcus Beresford, 1st Earl of Tyrone leased the land of "Downagh" to Robert Saunders (Irish lawyer), one of the founders of the village of Swanlinbar, for a term of 99 years. Saunder's son Morley later sold his leasehold interest to Colonel John Enery of Bawnboy. Deeds, tenant lists etc. relating to Tawnagh from 1650 onwards are available at- by searching for Derryvella.
The 1690 list of outlawed Irish Jacobites in County Cavan includes "John Graham and Thomas Graham of Gortatole, gents". John Graham was probably the man named in the Hearth Money Rolls above or his son.
A lease dated 23 December 1720 from Morley Saunders to Thomas Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Towmin".
The will of Philip Fitzpatrick of "Gratetowel" is dated 30 July 1735.
A deed dated 30 April 1740 by Thomas Enery includes: "Tuomin". 
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Towmin". as does a further deed dated 13 December 1774.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Tawnaghy".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Townagh".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list twelve tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance survey Namebooks state- "Contains 146 acres of which 132 are cultivated, 6 are uncultivated rough pasture and 8 of bog."
In the 19th century the landlord was Lord John Beresford, the Protestant Archbishop of Armagh. The muddled land history of the area prior to this is described in the 1838 Exchequer case, "Attorney General of Ireland v The Lord Primate". 
The Tawnagh Valuation Office Field books are available for 1839-1840.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 99, being 42 males and 57 females. There were fifteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 53, being 27 males and 26 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were ten houses in the townland, of which one was in the course of erection.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists fourteen landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 36, being 19 males and 17 females. There were nine houses in the townland and all were inhabited.

BrickerBot

BrickerBot was malware that attempted to permanently destroy ("brick") insecure Internet of Things devices. BrickerBot logged into poorly-secured devices and ran harmful commands to disable them. It was first discovered by Radware after it attacked their honeypot in April 2017. On December 10, 2017, BrickerBot was retired.
Discovery.
BrickerBot.1 and BrickerBot.2.
The BrickerBot family of malware was first discovered by Radware on April 20, 2017, when BrickerBot attacked their honeypot 1,895 times over four days. BrickerBot's method of attack was to brute-force the telnet password, then run commands using BusyBox to corrupt MMC and MTD storage, delete all files, and disconnect the device from the Internet. Less than an hour after the initial attack, bots began sending a slightly different set of malicious commands, indicating a new version, BrickerBot.2. BrickerBot.2 used the Tor network to hide its location, did not rely on the presence of busybox on the target, and was able to corrupt more types of storage devices.
BrickerBot.3 and BrickerBot.4.
BrickerBot.3 was detected on May 20, 2017, one month after the initial discovery of BrickerBot.1. On the same day, one device was identified as a BrickerBot.4 bot. No other instances of BrickerBot.4 were seen since.
Shutdown and Impact.
According to Janit0r, the author of BrickerBot, it destroyed more than ten million devices before Janit0r announced the retirement of BrickerBot on December 10, 2017. In an interview with "Bleeping Computer", Janit0r stated that BrickerBot was intended to prevent devices from being infected by Mirai. US-CERT released an alert regarding BrickerBot on April 12, 2017.

Bjørn West

Bjørn West was one out of many Milorg bases in German-occupied Norway, located in Matrefjella in Masfjorden.
The base was under the direct command of the Norwegian High Command in London. The purpose of the base was to set up a force that could operate behind German lines in case of an allied invasion of Norway. If it came under attack, the force was supposed to either withdraw to the mountains along Sognefjorden, or be evacuated by the navy. The force received its supplies by the sea as well as from the air. By the spring of 1945, the force counted 255 men, headed by Captain Harald Risnes and Fredrik Kayser.
Attempts to negotiate.
The Germans learned of the base in early 1945. Wanting a peaceful end of the war in Norway, Lt. Gen Johannes de Boer attempted to contact the Norwegian resistance movement. This appears to have been a solo effort, as Franz Böhme, commander-in-chief in German-occupied Norway, ordered German troops to be prepared for battle. As de Boer tried to negotiate with the Norwegians, fighting broke out in Matrefjella between German forces and the force at Bjørn West.
Battle.
On April 27, German forces and Gestapo landed at Matre in Masfjorden, shortly followed by German warships. Around 4 in the morning on April 28, the Germans attacked the base at Fossestølen. A Norwegian force repelled a smaller German force. The battles continued at Kringlebotn until the next day. Hard battles took place in the afternoon northwest of Litlematrestølen, where 11 Norwegian soldiers repelled the Germans. Battles broke out by Krokavatnet north of Stordalen on May 1. On May 3, the Germans started crossing Klavefjellet toward Stordalen. After six days of battle, the Norwegians had lost six soldiers. The Germans suffered between 35 and 117 dead.
General de Boer made it clear that the battle had to stop, as otherwise there would be no reason to continue negotiating. The Norwegian forces had to withdraw, while he made sure the German attacks were halted. Bjørn West received orders from London on May 2 to avoid further clashes. The Norwegian force withdrew on May 4. Fredrik Kayser later stated that had the battle continued for another week, Bjørn West would have faced certain annihilation.
The Germans capitulated in Norway on May 9, five days after the battles in Masfjorden had ended. The same day, Bjørn West was ordered by the Norwegian government in exile to go to Bergen and assume control.

Rei Amador

Amador Vieira, best known as Rei Amador, was a member of the king of the Angolars and leader of a famous slave rebellion that took place in 1595 in the African islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. According to some historic documents, Rei Emadir was "a slave" who avoided slavery and mobilized all the Angolares along with other Africans and made a free nation under the middle of the aforementioned islands.
History of the origin of the Angolars.
The Angolars inhabited the south of the island of São Tomé, there are different versions on the history .
The first story on the origin of the Angolars was that they were African slaves brought from the mainland, probably from Angola who survived a shipwreck about 2–3 miles (4 km) off the south coast of São Tomé Island.
Another version was that the Angolars were African slaves who evaded their owners around 1470, when the Portuguese discovered the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe. aThey created their own free nation within the islands called Kilombo or Quilombo. The name Kilombo or Quilombo derives from Kimbundu (one of the most spoken languages in Angola), it can mean a settlement kingdom, population and union. Kilombo was an independent nation made by African slaves, who fought against slavery abd once they fled, built their independent state. The Kilombos, in general were localized in its regions densely forested, far from the plantations.
A third version was that the Angolars were Africans who immigrated from the mainland to the islands of São Tomé and Príncipe, long before the arrivals of the Portuguese into the islands. However, the story of the Angolars and their reign in São Tomé and Príncipe are part of a history of self-determination and independence carried out by Rei Amador.
Slave rebellion.
On 9 July 1595, Rei Amador, and his people, the Angolars, allied with other enslaved Africans of its plantations, marched into the interior woods and battled against the Portuguese. It is said that day, Rei Amador and his followers raised a flag in front of the settlers and proclaimed Rei Amador as king of São Tomé and Príncipe, making himself as "Rei Amador, liberator of all the black people".
Between 1595 and 1596, the island of São Tomé was ruled by the Angolars, under the command of Rei Amador. On 4 January 1596, he was captured, sent to prison and was later executed by the Portuguese. Still today, they remember him fondly and consider him a national hero of the islands.

Belliena gens

The gens Belliena or Billiena was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. "Bellienus" is the form that occurs in writers, while "Billienus" is more common in inscriptions. Members of this gens are first mentioned toward the end of the Republic. Lucius Bellienus obtained the praetorship in 107 BC, but was prevented from obtaining the consulship. The Bellieni occur in history down to the time of Caesar, after which the family faded into obscurity; but others are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
Cicero refers to a "Gaius Annius Bellienus", and from this it has been inferred that "Bellienus" might be a cognomen of the Annia gens; but even if this Bellienus or some of the others mentioned in history are correctly identified as Annii, the evidence from inscriptions demonstrates that "Bellienus" was a separate nomen gentilicium. The name belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix "-enus", frequently found in Picenum and Umbria. Such names were typically derived from other gentilicia, rather than from place names, as was the case with the similar gentile-forming suffix "-anus"; in this case probably "Bellius", also found as "Billius", "Belius", and "Bilius".
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Bellieni were "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Marcus". Other names occur infrequently, including one instance of the Oscan praenomen "Salvius", appearing in the filiation of one of the family.
Branches and cognomina.
The Bellieni do not seem to have been divided into distinct families. They used a number of personal surnames, including "Niger" and "Rufus", referring to black or red hair, respectively; "Dexter", literally "right-handed", but figuratively "lucky" or "skilled"; "Genialis", "genial"; and "Vitalis", "vital". "Actiacus" was assumed by a soldier who had fought at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. "Messor", the name of another soldier, refers to one who reaps or mows. Several women of this gens bore "Secunda" or "Tertia" as surnames; these were old praenomina that gradually came to be treated as cognomina, typically being placed at the end of the name, although they retained their original individualizing function.

The Democratic Advocate

The Democratic Advocate was a semiweekly newspaper published from November 30, 1865 to 1968 in Westminster, Carroll County, Maryland. Shortly after its predecessor, the "Western Maryland Democrat", ceased publication due to violence from an angry mob in the aftermath of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, former publisher William H. Davis established the "Advocate" in 1865. About a year later, Davis turned over operations to Joseph M. Parke, a lawyer and Democratic office holder. 
After gaining control of the paper, Parke published the following promise: "We promise to the down trodden people of Maryland our best efforts in their cause, and our firm adhesion to the principles of the great Conservative National Party now rising, whose mission it will be, under the providence of God, to sweep from power every distracting element which stands in the way of a speedy restoration of our whole country to its former united and happy condition."
In 1868, William H. Vanderford assumed control of the "Advocate" and installed his father, Henry Vanderford, in the position of editor. Henry Vanderford was an experienced newspaperman who had previously published the "Cecil Democrat" in the 1840s. The proprietorship of the paper changed slightly in 1878, with William's younger brother Charles Vanderford joining the team as co-editor. Charles also had previous newspaper experience - both with Middletown, Delaware's "Middletown Transcript" and with Harrisonburg, Virginia's "Old Commonwealth". 
Charles Vanderford died in 1906, and his father William bought his son's interest in the paper and formed The Democratic Advocate Company. With this change, the paper again published a solemn promise to its readers, affirming, "The paper will, as heretofore, be distinctively a Democratic newspaper, upholding and promoting, as far as it may be able, the principles of the Democratic party. It will be conducted upon the broad and conservative lines of a Democratic paper desiring to serve the entire party. It will in no way seek to promote the political interests of individuals, nor interfere, in any way, with the free expression of the will of the Democrats of our county in the choice of candidates for public office."
The Historical Society of Carroll County notes that Dr. J. Howard Billingslea was president of The Democratic Advocate Company while William H. Vanderford was editor. His successor Edward Diffendal acted as editor from 1906 to 1960, when Virginia Minnick took over as managing editor. The final issue of the paper was published on December 26, 1968, after which the "Advocate" was purchased by the "Carroll County Times" and published as the "Advocate-Times" until September 25, 1972.
In terms of political tone, the "Democratic Advocate", though staunchly Democratic, reflected the increasingly mundane political interests of the citizens of Carroll County. The Carroll County Agricultural Society opened a new fairgrounds and race track in 1869, placing emphasis on the importance of farming to the area's economy. Milling was an especially profitable enterprise, so when in 1872 a prominent local miller was murdered, the community followed the trials, appeals, and eventual execution of the murderer Joseph Davis in the "Advocate" as well as its rival paper, the "American Sentinel".

Capussa

Capussa was a king of the ancient Numidian tribe Massylii in 206 BCE. He was the son of Oezalces who had succeeded his brother, Gala, on the massylian throne. 
Biography.
Oezalces had normally inherited the power since he was the oldest prince. When he died, a few months after his arrival, his eldest son, Capussa, was proclaimed king without Masinissa, son of Gala, attempting to assert his rights since in the order of succession, he was just after his cousin Capussa.
The reign of Capussa was short-lived. A hostile party was formed by Mazaetullus, a Numidian chief related to the royal lineage but having no rights to the throne. Mazaetullus had married the widow of Oezalces, a Carthaginian, which earned him the support of at least a part of the Punic aristocracy concerned perhaps from this time to remove Masinissa from power, although he has until then faithfully served the interests of Carthage fighting under Hasdrubal's orders in Spain. 
Capussa was defeated and killed in a coup d'état by Mazaetullus. He proclaimed as a King, Lacumazes, the youngest son of Oezalces, then set himself as a regent.

John Clare Cottage is a cottage and literary museum in Helpston, Peterborough, United Kingdom. The cottage was the birthplace of English poet John Clare (1793-1864).
The thatched Grade II* cottage at 12 Woodgate, Helpston, originally consisted of five smaller tenement buildings, that were joined into a single structure at a later date.
The cottage was bought by the John Clare Trust in 2005. In May 2007, the Trust gained £1.27 million of funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and commissioned Jefferson Sheard Architects to create a new landscape design and Visitor Centre, including a cafe, shop and exhibition space. The Cottage was restored using traditional building methods and is open to the public.
In 2013 the John Clare Trust received a further grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help preserve the building and provide educational activities for young people visiting the cottage.
The garden behind the cottage is maintained by volunteers, and planted with varieties which would have been seen in Clare's time.
The John Clare Cottage forms part of the Fens Museum Partnership, along with Peterborough Museum and Flag Fen.

Industrial snow

Industrial snow occurs near sources of heat, moisture and atmospheric particulate matter. It usually occurs at nighttime, in a combination of freezing temperatures, stagnant low stratus cloud or fog, and a temperature inversion. It falls from a low altitude as fine spikes of ice, having not had time to grow to the more usual shaped snowflake.
It has been observed in Switzerland, Germany, Northern Italy (where it is referred to as "neve chimica", "chemical snow"), Hungary, in Canada (where it was referred to as "refinery snow", or "plant snow"), and Texas.

Alberto Baltra

Alberto Baltra Cortés (6 January 1912 – 20 September 1981) was a Chilean politician and economist, a member of the Radical Party.
Biography.
The son of Luis Baltra Opazo and Luisa Cortés Monroy, Alberto Baltra studied at the Liceo de Traiguén and the National Institute.
He entered the University of Chile, where he received the institution's award for the best graduate in 1935. He obtained his law degree in 1937, with a report entitled "Ensayo de una teoría general de los actos inoponibles". As a student, he worked first in the law school library (1930–1932) and later as secretary of the school's director (1932–1934).
Baltra specialized in economics, and in 1935 he became the founder and first director of his alma mater's School of Commerce and Economics. He then taught university and wrote several books on economics.
In 1937 he joined the Radical Party, and under the government of Juan Antonio Ríos, in 1942, he was appointed general director of the Ministry of Economy and Commerce. During the first year of the presidency of Gabriel González Videla, he was appointed undersecretary of Economy and Commerce, and the following year, in 1947, minister of the sector, a position he held until 1950.
In 1948 he became the first president of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), and led Chile's delegations to the conferences of this organization in Havana (1949), Montevideo (1950), and Mexico (1951). Later he would be a consultant to CEPAL. In 1952 he was appointed vice president of the (COVENSA), and from 1956 to 1958 he was an advisor to the Comptroller General of the Republic. He also became general director of Madeco in 1957.
He held several leading positions in the Radical Party, becoming national president in 1958.
In the complementary elections of 1968 he was elected senator for the eighth provincial group of Bío Bío, Malleco, and Cautín, replacing the late José García González (PDC). Baltra narrowly defeated (PADENA), 58,050 votes to 57,284. (PN) came third with 35,949. For the election he received the support of the Popular Action Front parties, in what was one of the first rapprochements of radicalism with the rest of the leftist forces.
The following year he was a candidate for the presidency of Chile for the Radical Party, which was part of Popular Unity, and the latter eventually elected the candidate Salvador Allende.
Baltra, who had been on the left wing of the Radical Party and was president of the Chilean-Soviet Culture Institute, resisted the course his political group was taking during the Allende government. Finally – along with other well-known politicians such as – he ended up renouncing it on 3 August 1971 and, the same day, forming the Independent Left Radical Movement. Later that year this became the Radical Left Party (PIR). The new group was originally part of Popular Unity, but it later abandoned this alliance and was critical of the Allende government.
For the parliamentary elections of March 1973, the PIR joined with other center-right opposition parties in the Confederation of Democracy, formed in July 1972, and Baltra ran for Senator for Santiago, but received only 1.92% of the vote.
Baltra wrote several works on economics, some of which were awarded and used as textbooks at the University of Chile. He was a professor there, and among his disciples was the future president Ricardo Lagos, who was his assistant. He was a member of the Chilean Academy of Social, Political, and Moral Sciences.
In 1940 he married the lawyer Adriana Olguín, who would be the first female minister in Latin America to occupy the Justice portfolio under González Videla. The couple had one son, Luis Alberto Baltra Olguín.
Alberto Baltra died on 20 September 1981, the victim of a cardiac arrest while walking down Antonio Varas Street near his house in the district of Providencia.

Claude Hinscliff

Reverend Claude Hinscliff (1875–1964) was a British suffragist.
Education and early career.
Hinscliff studied for his licentiate in theology at Durham University. He matriculated in 1893 and was awarded a scholarship after performing well in the admissions exam. As a student he coxed for the university boat club. A member of Hatfield Hall, he graduated in 1896. As reported in 15 June 1897 edition of "The Times", he was ordained a deacon in the Diocese of Norwich and attached to Parham and Hacheston in Suffolk. In December 1899 he was ordained a priest at St George in the Meadows, Nottingham. By 1905 he was Vicar of Bobbing in Kent.
Involvement with women's suffrage.
Hinscliff is most notable for his involvement in the British suffrage movement. He founded the Anglican Church League for Women's Suffrage in 1909, and was its secretary for a long time. He and fellow member Charles Baumgarten (and, according to the "Church Times", the Archdeacon of Lewisham, Charles Escreet), conducted the funeral service of Emily Davison in St. George's, Bloomsbury, where Baumgarten was vicar.
Later life.
By 1913 he had become very uncomfortable with the militancy of suffragettes, which included arson attacks on churches, and as a result the Church League began to distance itself from the WSPU. He resigned his position as honorary organiser in 1914 on doctor's orders, having been diagnosed with myocarditis in 1911. He then worked in Europe. In 1920 he served on the staff of the Serbian Relief Fund and by March of the following year was established as British Chaplain in Belgrade. He soon moved on to Romania, where he served as the British Chaplain in Bucharest from 1921-1924.
Legacy.
His name and picture (and those of 58 other women's suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

Weapon systems engineering

Weapon systems engineering involves using engineering tools in technology to create and guarantee the safety and performance of weapons. It is currently being used by the military and the government to create new weapons to protect the United States. It is used to make nuclear and non-nuclear weapons and ensure their safety throughout their lifespan.
Companies involved.
Many companies help our government and military to manufacture new weapons and strategies. One is Parsons. The Missile Defense Agency, MDA, is a research agency that develops and tests the missile defense agency to defend the United States and its allies. Parsons helps with this through the MDA missile contract. They provide missile system support including tests and evaluating the performance.
The U.S. Navy awarded multi-million-dollar contracts with Tekla Research and Avian-Precise Co. to support the "Naval Air Systems Command's Systems Engineering Department". Tekla is to help NAVAIR assess technology, cost, and design. Avian-Precise is to help the command sustain a weapons system related to all U.S. naval platforms and systems.
Inventions.
The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a new long-range weapon using electricity instead of chemicals to launch projectiles. Projectiles can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate explosives where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a "low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles" and a "nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile".
The U.S. Army is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a Humvee to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another soldier or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics. The Army is not looking to make killing machines, but machines controlled by humans.
The US Air Force Research Lab (AFRL) assigned Lockheed Martin the job of creating "an aircraft-mounted high-power fibre laser". They must make a weapon that is small enough and light enough, but also can be effective. The laser will be mounted on jet fighters with the ability to disable enemies targeting systems.

Mikalai Dvornikau

Mikalai Dvornikau (Belarusian: Мікалай Мікалаевіч Дворнікаў, "Mikalai Mikalaevich Dvornikau" Russian: Николай Николаевич Дворников, "Nikolai Nikolaevich Dvornikov") known under the pseudonyms Gerasim, Andrei, Anton, Stanislav Tomashevich, Robert and Petya (7 December 1907, in Gomel – 16 February 1938, in Extremadura) was a Soviet Belarusian political militant, a member of the Communist Party of Western Belarus and the Communist Youth League (Komsomol) of Western Belarus. He was a participant of the Spanish Civil War, political instructor of the Jose Palafox battalion and commander of the Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko.
Biography.
Mikalai Dvornikau was born on 7 December 1907, in Gomel in a working-class family. Since 1926 he worked on swamps draining, at the construction sites of the bridge over the Sozh river, and the Palace of Culture of Railway Workers, was a worker of the agricultural machinery plant "Gomselmash". Since 1927 he was a member of the Belarusian Komsomol, since 1929 was a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). In 1928–1929 he was the secretary of the Komsomol organization of the Gomselmash plant; in 1929–1931 was the secretary of a district committee of the Komsomol. Since January 1931 he was a member of the Central Committee of the Belarusian Komsomol.
Underground in Western Belarus.
In 1932, Dvornikau attended the Party School courses organized by the Central Committee of the CPWB in Minsk, and then since November 1932 was sent to underground work to Western Belarus (controlled by the Second Polish Republic), appointed as the Secretary of the Bialystok, and then the Brest Regional Committee of the illegal Western Belarusian Komsomol.
In May–July 1933, in the forests near Brest, under Dvornikau's leadership, a conference of the Brest Regional Committee of the CPWB took place. It was decided to launch mass protests of the peasants of the Brest region; a campaign of mass peasant actions against landlords was approved. Dvornikau became one of the organizers of the peasants' armed uprising on 3–4 August in Kobryń district, which was brutally suppressed, and ended with pacification actions and arrests. Dvornikau launched a mass national-wide campaign in support of the communists sentenced to death for participation in the uprising. As a result, they succeeded in softening of the sentence.
In November 1933, he was co-opted to the Central Committee Secretariat of the CPWB and started his work in Wilno. Since October 1935, he continues his activities in Poland as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Western Belarusian Komsomol.
He organized an assassination attempt on the Polish political intelligence agent Jan Strelchuk, who had been infiltrated into the communist underground and had revealed many CPWB members. The action took place on 27 January 1935, during Strelchuk was giving his testimony at the trial against a group of 17 revolutionaries in Wilno. Dvornikau was the backup of the main executor Siarhei Prytytski. After the police had attempted to arrest him, Dvornikau wounded a policeman and run away.
Civil War in Spain.
From 1936 to 1938, Dvornikau fought in the fronts of the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. Under the pseudonym Staislav Tomashevich he served as a political instructor in the Jose Palafox Battalion, which was a part of the XIII Dombrowski International Brigade. Since the end of 1937 he was the first commander of the Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko, where the Ukrainian and Belarusian communists from Poland and other countries served. Dvornikau fell on 16 February 1938, fighting against the fascists in the mountains of Extremadura.
Homage.
In 1978 he was perpetuated in the poem "Mikalai Dvornikau", written by his underground times comrade Maksim Tank.
Two streets in Gomel and Brest are named after Mikalai Dvornikau. On the walls of the "Gomselmash" plant, where he worked being young, there is a memorial plaque.

Mpoko River

The Mpoko River is a river in Central African Republic It is a tributary of the Oubangui River. The river is located near the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui.
Description.
It is a small tributary off the Oubangui river, which is a tributary off the larger Congo River. The Mpoko River covers 23,900 km2 of land area and 86% savanna cover. It begins on the Oubangui River near the capital, Bangui, and flows northwest. It drains a savanna dominated ecosystem.
History surrounding Mpoko River.
Starting in 1899, the French gave land commissions in the French Congo to 39 companies. The companies had to pay royalties to France and their main objective was the collection of rubber and ivory. One concessionary company called the "La Mpoko" was founded on July 10, 1899 with the intention of exploiting a concession that covered the basin of the Mpoko River and the other tributaries. Guilbrand Schiötz was appointed head of the company in Bimbo, in 1906 Gaston Guibet was appointed head. The chief of the Bouriki peoples came to Guibet with a complaint, armed company men were demanding more rubber in his village and committing violent crimes. In 1907 Guibet reported to the local judicial authorities the crimes committed by agents under La Mpoko. The agents would take women as hostages demanding certain rubber quotas and beat and kill many people for no apparent reason. Agents stationed there would often rape women while the men were away at work. Schiötz resigned and left Africa in 1907 right as Guibet began to start an investigation. The French Congo high commissioner Èmile Gentil asked Paris to shut La Mpoko down but was rejected and the minister in Paris claimed that legal procedures against the company's clients had to be completed first. On April 29, 1909 a persecutor in Brazzaville gave a verdict that relieved the company and clients of their crimes. Due to its bad reputation the La Mpoko concession was revoked in 1910 and the company was liquidated in February 1911.
Turbidity.
The Mpoko river was found to have high TSM levels around 78.0 mg L−1 contrasting from the low levels ranging around 0.7–16.0 mg L−1 from more rainforest dominated rivers. TSM levels, standing for total suspended matter, depict how clear the water is in a river. Due to the surrounding savanna ecosystem, the water quality of the Mpoko River is highly turbid and not recommended for drinking.

CEMSA

CEMSA (Construzioni Elettro Meccaniche di Saronno) was an Italian engineering company which operated from 1925 to 1948.
History.
CEMSA was founded in Saronno in 1925 by engineer Nicola Romeo and backed by Credito Italiano. It used the former factory of Costruzioni Meccaniche di Saronno which had closed in 1918. In 1935, after a series of writedowns of the share capital, the company was bought by Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale (IRI) and the following year it was sold to the aeronautical engineer Gianni Caproni who already controlled Isotta Fraschini.
During World War II, CEMSA built light weapons and, at the end of the war, the company started producing cars thanks to collaboration with the engineer Antonio Fessia, who in 1946 had left FIAT. In a few months Fessia, who had transformed CEMSA into a company dedicated to the construction of sports cars, succeeded in designing a car with innovative technical characteristics, the CEMSA Caproni F.11 (), which was presented at the Paris salon in 1947. Only 10 sedan cars of this model were produced. A cabriolet version was also planned but it was not realized due to the financial crisis that hit the company in 1948 and forced it to close. One of the prototypes of the F.11 was shipped to the United States, in the hope of concluding an agreement with the Tucker sales network for the distribution of the model in the US, but this project did not come to fruition because of the closure of the company. In 1953, the Belgian company, Minerva, bought an F.11 in an attempt to put it into production, but even this project failed.
The car.
The F.11 was designed by Antonio Fessia and had revolutionary technical characteristics. These included a 4-cylinder boxer engine which was cantilevered with respect to the front axle, steering column gear change, front suspension with transverse leaf spring and front wheel drive. All these innovations were later incorporated into the 1960 Lancia Flavia, also designed by Fessia. The body design was by the company's technicians and was styled by Bertone. When CEMSA closed, most of the ten cars were dispersed but one F.11, in excellent condition, survives on display at the Volandia museum.
Railway rolling stock.
Steam locomotives.
Examples of steam locomotives built by CEMSA include:
Railcars.
In 1924 a delegation of FS officials, at the Seddin railway station in Berlin, took an interest in some German railcars during a railway convention. They were two-axle vehicles driven by Benz engines. The 6-cylinder Otto cycle engines with carburettors were fuelled by benzole. The transmission comprised a clutch and mechanical gearbox. In the same year, the Romeo company of Milan obtained the construction license and put it into operation in the new CEMSA factory in Saronno, launching series production. The FS ordered three units, fuelled by a mixture of naphtha and petrol with the application of a special patented carburettor by Aliverti, although two were actually built in Germany. The units were:
Two other units were purchased by the Italian Railway and Tramway Company and by the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer du Midi de Italie (CFMT) which operated the Ferrovia Alifana.
Electric locomotives.

Gads Forlag

Gads Forlag, formerly G. E. C. Gad, is a publishing agent in Denmark. It is owned by G.E.C. Gads Fond, a publishing house based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
History.
 
The company was founded as G. E. C. Gad on 31 October 1855 when Gottlieb Ernst Clausen Gad established a combined book shop and publishing house on Vimmelskaftet in Copenhagen. He had spent the previous 10 years working for Gtldendal, first as an apprentice and later as an assistant. The following year he became a partner in Forlagsbureauet i København alongside Gyldendal, C. G. Iversen, Lose &amp; Delbanco. Gad, who had good connections at the University of Copenhagen, specialized in scientific and other nonfictional literature. His book shop was the last book shop to be awarded the title of university book shop in 1882. Another early focus area of his publishings was Norwegian and Swedish literature. In 1783, he bought out the last co-owner of Forlagsbureuet i Kjøbenhavn and merged it into his company. 
In 1897, G. E. C. Gad purchased a new building at Vimmelskaftet 32, not far from its old headquarters. Gad's two sons, Oscar and Frederik Gad, were made partners in the company that same year. Their father served as president of the Danish Booksellers Association in 1897-1902. Frederik Gad became the sole owner of the company following his father's death in 1906 and his elder brother's death in 1920. Kay Lynnerup (1925-1990) was appointed to CEO of the company in 19956.
Frederik Gad, having no heirs, established G.E.C. Gads Fond in 1965 and ceded the ownership of the company to the foundation.
On 11 November 1988, Gad inaugurated a large new warehouse in Avedøre Holme. Pm 1 March 1889, Bjarne Pedersen replaced Kay Lynnerup as CEO. In 2000. Gad and Egmont-owned Grafisk skolebogsforla established Gad &amp; Grafisk I/S. mow Alinea, specializing in school for Danish primary schools.
The company ran into economic difficulties in the early 1990s. Bjerne Pedersen was fired in 1994 and was replaced by Vilhelm Güntelberg as a temporary solution. Gad's legal publication, including "Ygeskrift for Retsvæsen, was moved to a new company, Gad Jura A/S, with Karnov as a majority owner.
G.E.C. Gads Boglader A/ (book shops).
In 1970, G.E.C. Gad took over Zachariassens Boghandel in Kongens Lyngby. Over the next decades a number of other bookshops were acquired or opened across the country. The publishing house and the chain of bookshops were divided into two separate companies on 1 October 1994. Frederik Christiansen (born 1942) was the first CEO of the retail chain. At this point the chain consisted of 16 bookshops. Lars Ive (born 1951) succeeded Frederik Christiansen as CEO of the chain on 1 April 2003.
On 28 February 2007, the chain was sold to Indeks Retail Invest A/S. The book shop at Vimmelskafter closed after 154 years on 27 July 2009.

Plot.
Misato Kurihara, a genius girl who couldn't make any friends due to her exceptional abilities, is killed after being run over while protecting a young girl. Offered the chance to be reborn into a fantasy world, Misato asks that she simply be reincarnated with average abilities. Reborn as the noble Adele von Ascham, she soon discovers that "average" in this new world takes into account the power of the absolute strongest and the absolute weakest magical creatures, resulting in her physical and magical abilities being 6,800 times stronger than that of a typical human, which is half of that of the strongest ancient dragon (the strongest of all the magical creatures). Attending Hunter's Prep School alongside her classmates Mavis, Reina, and Pauline, Adele tries her best to live her life as normally as possible, which does not prove to be an easy feat.

James L. Hicks

James L. "Jimmy" Hicks (May 9, 1915 – January 16, 1986) was a member of the black press from 1935 to 1977. Hicks' most recognizable works were his stories that covered school integration in Little Rock, Arkansas and Oxford, Mississippi, and his coverage of the Emmett Till murder trial in Sumner, Mississippi.
Biography.
Early years.
Hicks was born in Akron, Ohio, on May 9, 1915. He was educated at the University of Akron, Ohio, and Howard University.
Military service.
Hicks enlisted as a private in the U.S. Army, and during his service in New Guinea he was awarded three battle stars and promoted to captain. In an interview for the documentary, "Eyes on the Prize", Hicks claimed that his time spent in the military, among many other black veterans', heavily influenced his activist role when he returned to the United States. Hicks said of the beginning of his involvement in the Civil Rights Movement, "I spent three years overseas in New Guinea and I became an officer during that period. I had been eager to exercise authority, so when we got out it was just one more step towards saying, 'look, we aren't going to take this anymore'."
Career.
Hicks began his career in journalism as a reporter for the "Cleveland Call and Post" in 1935. After his stint in the war, he joined the "Baltimore Afro-American", and in his time there became the Washington Bureau Chief for the National Negro Press Association. He served as the executive editor for the "New York Amsterdam News" during 1955–1966, and again 1972–1977. In 1977, he became editor for the "New York Voice".
Hicks also held positions in public relations for the National Urban League and as the assistant commissioner of the New York State Division of Human Rights. Hicks was the first black member of the State Department Correspondents Association and the first black journalist cleared to cover the United Nations; for this he is labeled by some as a "pioneer in the field".
Emmett Till murder trial.
Hicks' coverage of the Emmett Till murder trial was published as a series of installments in dozens of newspapers including the "Baltimore Afro-American", the "Cleveland Call and Post", and the "Atlanta Daily World". His investigative journalism uncovered the identities of two key witnesses to the murder, who Hicks believed, would have led to the prosecution of the accused, Roy Bryant and J.W. Milam. The witnesses, Leroy "Too-Tight" Collins, and Henry Lee Loggins, had been seen riding in the back of J.W. Milam's truck with Emmett Till the night he was murdered. Hicks and his colleague, L. Alex Wilson, continued to track down these witnesses well after the trial had ended and this investigative work was featured in the documentary, "The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till" produced by Keith Beauchamp.
Articles by Hicks written for the "Cleveland Call and Post" are found in Christopher Metress's "The Lynching of Emmett Till: A Documentary Narrative" (University of Virginia Press, Sept 2002).
These were published in the 2000 Spring issue of Archipelago Vol. 6, No. 1. 
On January 20, 2003 the documentary “The Murder of Emmett Till” was broadcast by “American Experience” and PBS.
The book "Why It’s Unlikely the Emmett Till Murder Mystery Will Ever Be Solved" by authors David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito include references to Hicks' role in events surrounding the trial of Bryant and Milam.
The Little Rock Nine.
In 1957, Hicks, alongside several other representatives of the black press, Earl Davy, Moses Newson, and L. Alex Wilson, attended the integration of nine black students into Little Rock Central High School. When the black reporters arrived on the scene they were beaten and chased by a mob, which was protesting the integration outside the school. After the students gained entry to the school, the mob accused the black reporters of being a decoy for the students. In a story he wrote for "Amsterdam News" on September 28, 1957, Hicks states, "After we were safely out of the mob area, reports came over the radio that we had been sent to the school as 'decoys' to the mob so that they would not notice the Negro children when they slipped in. This is actually what happened but it certainly was not in our plan."
James Meredith and Ole Miss.
In Hicks' story, "On the Mississippi Warfront: Oxford's a Town all Shook Up", printed by "Amsterdam News" in 1962, Hicks described the events leading up to James Meredith's reported visit to the Ole Miss campus as "chaos and bedlam". Despite the possession of valid press credentials, the black press members, including Hicks, were denied access to the campus and were only able to cover the story from outside the school gates. Because of his inability to access the campus, Hicks followed the mob to stay close to the story of James Meredith's arrival. In order to keep James Meredith, a black student attempting to integrate Ole Miss, out of Oxford, the town "massed every law officer the state of Mississippi could produce", and hoped this would convince Meredith not to return. Hicks described the town as a "mess".
Death.
Hicks died in Manhattan, New York, on January 16, 1986 at the age of 70.
Personal life.
He was married to the former Daisy Turner, and they had two children, James Jr. and Norma Hicks Robinson.

St Margaret's Church, Burnham Norton

St Margaret's Church is a round-tower church in Burnham Norton, Norfolk, England. Likely to have been built in the 11th century, the building retains many medieval architectural features, and is Grade I listed. It also retains an elaborately decorated 15th-century pulpit, considered one of the finest surviving examples of its type.
Architecture.
The village of Burnham Norton is one of the Norfolk Burnhams, a group of villages in Norfolk, England. Approximately west of Wells-next-the-Sea, it is separated from the sea by tidal marshes.
Burnham Norton's parish church, St Margaret's, is one of 129 surviving round-tower churches in Norfolk. Opinion differs as to its date of construction. Most historians conclude that the tower and at least part of the main building is Anglo-Saxon in origin, built between 1000 and 1066 AD. However, no church is listed in Burnham Norton in 1086's Domesday Book, leading some historians to believe that the building is of early Norman construction. The building was gradually altered in later years, and is not internally symmetrical. The north arcade is supported by 13th-century round columns, while the south arcade is supported by more elaborate 14th-century octagonal columns. The east window of the church is an ornate stained-glass window installed in the late 1920s, depicting saints Margaret of Antioch and Margaret of Scotland. The church building is Grade I listed, the highest level of recognition available to a historical building in England.
Internal elements.
Internally, the church retains many of its medieval architectural elements, including an unusually large stone font. A recess near the north door was once the wafer oven used to bake communion wafers. St Margaret's also retains its rood screen, donated in 1458 by William and Johanne Groom; the screen's panels originally depicted images of saints and the Grooms, but these images were defaced during the Reformation.
St Margaret's has two pulpits. One is in regular use, and was built in the 19th century to a plain design, using early 17th-century paneling from the church. The other is no longer in use, and was gifted to the church by John and Catharine Goldale in 1450. The latter is considered one of the finest surviving examples of its style. A "wine glass" shape, a hexagon tapering at the base to a narrow point, it is heavily decorated; its six panels depict the Goldales, Pope Gregory I, Augustine of Canterbury, Saint Ambrose and Saint Jerome.

IOTA (technology)

IOTA is an open-source distributed ledger and cryptocurrency designed for the Internet of things (IoT). It uses a directed acyclic graph to store transactions on its ledger, motivated by a potentially higher scalability over blockchain based distributed ledgers. IOTA does not use miners to validate transactions, instead, nodes that issue a new transaction on the network must approve two previous transactions. Transactions can therefore be issued without fees, facilitating microtransactions. The network currently achieves consensus through a coordinator node, operated by the IOTA Foundation. As the coordinator is a single point of failure, the network is currently centralized. 
IOTA has been criticized due to its unusual design, of which it is unclear whether it will work in practice. As a result, IOTA was rewritten from the ground up for a network update called Chrysalis, or IOTA 1.5, which launched on 28 April 2021. In this update, controversial decisions such as ternary encoding and quantum proof cryptography were left behind and replaced with established standards. A testnet for a follow-up update called Coordicide, or IOTA 2.0, was deployed in late 2020, with the aim of releasing a distributed network that no longer relies on the coordinator for consensus in 2021. 
History.
The value transfer protocol IOTA, named after the smallest letter of the Greek alphabet, was created in 2015 by David Sønstebø, Dominik Schiener, Sergey Ivancheglo, and Serguei Popov. Initial development was funded by an online public crowdsale, with the participants buying the IOTA value token with other digital currencies. Approximately 1300 BTC were raised, corresponding to approximately 500,000 USD at that time, and the total token supply was distributed pro-rata over the initial investors. The IOTA network went live in 2016.
IOTA foundation.
In 2017, early IOTA token investors donated 5% of the total token supply for continued development and to endow what became later became the IOTA Foundation. In 2018, the IOTA Foundation was chartered as a Stiftung in Berlin, with the goal to assist in the research and development, education and standardisation of IOTA technology. The IOTA Foundation is a board member of International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications (INATBA), and founding member of the Trusted IoT Alliance and Mobility Open Blockchain Initiative (MOBI), to promote blockchain and distributed ledgers in regulatory approaches, the IoT ecosystem and mobility.
Following a dispute between IOTA founders David Sønstebø and Sergey Ivancheglo, Ivancheglo resigned from the board of directors on 23 June 2019. On 10 December 2020 the IOTA Foundation Board of Directors and Supervisory Board announced that the Foundation officially parted ways with David Sønstebø.
DCI vulnerability disclosure.
On 8 September 2017, researchers Ethan Heilman from Boston University and Neha Nerula et al. from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) reported on potential security flaws with IOTA's former Curl-P-27 hash function. The IOTA Foundation received considerable backlash in their handling of the incident. FT Alphaville reported legal posturing by an IOTA Founder against a security researcher for his involvement in the DCI report, as well as instances of aggressive language levelled against a Forbes contributor and other unnamed journalists covering the DCI report. The Center for Blockchain Technologies at the University College London severed ties with the IOTA Foundation due to legal threats against security researchers involved in the report.
Attacks.
As a speculative blockchain and cryptocurrency-related technology, IOTA has been the target of phishing, scamming, and hacking attempts, which have resulted in the thefts of user tokens and extended periods of downtime. In January 2018, more than 10 million USD worth of IOTA tokens were stolen from users that used a malicious online seed-creator, a password that protects their ownership of IOTA tokens. The seed-generator scam was the largest fraud in IOTA history to date, with over 85 victims. In January 2019, the UK and German law enforcement agencies arrested a 36-year old man from Oxford, England believed to be behind the theft.
On 26 November 2019 a hacker discovered a vulnerability in a third-party payment service, provided by "MoonPay", integrated in the mobile and desktop wallet managed by the "IOTA Foundation". The attacker compromised over 50 IOTA seeds, resulting in the theft of approximately 2 Million USD worth in IOTA tokens. After receiving reports that hackers were stealing funds from user wallets, the IOTA Foundation shut down the coordinator on 12 February 2020. This had the side-effect of effectively shutting down the entire IOTA cryptocurrency. Users at-risk were given seven days to migrate their potentially compromised seed to a new seed, until 7 March 2020. The coordinator was restarted on 10 March 2020.
IOTA 1.5 (Chrysalis) and IOTA 2.0 (Coordicide).
The IOTA network is currently centralized, a transaction on the network is considered valid if and only if it is referenced by a milestone issued by a node operated by the IOTA foundation called the coordinator. In 2019 the IOTA Foundation announced that it would like to operate the network without a coordinator in the future, using a two-stage network update, termed Chrysalis for IOTA 1.5 and Coordicide for IOTA 2.0. The Chrysalis update went live on 28 April 2021, and removed its controversial design choices such as ternary encoding and Winternitz one-time signatures, to create an enterprise-ready blockchain solution. In parallel Coordicide is currently developed, to create a distributed network that no longer relies on the coordinator for consensus. A testnet of Coordicide was deployed late 2020, with the aim of releasing a final version in 2021.
Characteristics.
The Tangle.
The Tangle is the moniker used to describe IOTAs directed acyclic graph (DAG) transaction settlement and data integrity layer. It is structured as a string of individual transactions that are interlinked to each other and stored through a network of node participants. The Tangle does not have miners validating transactions, rather, network participants are jointly responsible for transaction validation, and must confirm two transactions already submitted to the network for every one transaction they issue. Transactions can therefore be issued to the network at no cost, facilitating micropayments. To avoid spam, every transaction requires computational resources based on Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms, to find the answer to a simple cryptographic puzzle.
IOTA supports both value and data transfers. A second layer protocol provides encryption and authentication of messages, or data streams, transmitted and stored on the Tangle as zero-value transactions. Each message holds a reference to the address of a follow-up message, connecting the messages in a data stream, and providing forward secrecy. Authorised parties with the correct decryption key can therefore only follow a datastream from their point of entry. When the owner of the data stream wants to revoke access, it can change the decryption key when publishing a new message. This provides the owner granular controls over the way in which data is exchanged to authorised parties.
IOTA token.
The IOTA token is a unit of value in the IOTA network. There is a fixed supply of 2,779,530,283,277,761 IOTA tokens in circulation on the IOTA network. IOTA tokens are stored in IOTA wallets protected by an 81-character seed, similar to a password. To access and spend the tokens, IOTA provides a cryptocurrency wallet. A hardware wallet can be used to keep credentials offline while facilitating transactions.
Coordinator node.
IOTA currently requires a majority of honest actors to prevent network attacks. However, as the concept of mining does not exist on the IOTA network, it is unlikely that this requirement will always be met. Therefore, consensus is currently obtained through referencing of transactions issued by a special node operated by the IOTA foundation, called the coordinator. The coordinator issues zero value transactions at given time intervals, called milestones. Any transaction, directly or indirectly, referenced by such a milestone is considered valid by the nodes in the network. The coordinator is an authority operated by the IOTA foundation and as such single point of failure for the IOTA network, which makes the network centralized.
Markets.
IOTA is traded in megaIOTA units (1,000,000 IOTA) on digital currency exchanges such as Bitfinex, and listed under the MIOTA ticker symbol. Like other digital currencies, IOTA’s token value has soared and fallen.
Fast Probabilistic Consensus (FPC).
The crux of cryptocurrencies is to stop double spends, the ability to spend the same money twice in two simultaneous transactions. Bitcoin's solution has been to use Proof of Work (PoW) making it a significant financial burden to have a minted block be rejected for a double spend. IOTA has designed a voting algorithm called Fast Probabilistic Consensus to form a consensus on double spends. Instead of starting from scratch, the IOTA Foundation started with Simple Majority Consensus where the first opinion update is defined by,
formula_1
Where formula_2 is the opinion of node formula_3 at time formula_4. The function formula_5 is the percent of all the nodes that have the opinion formula_4 and formula_7 is the threshold for majority, set by the implementation. After the first round, the successive opinions change at time formula_8 to the function,
formula_9
Although, this model is fragile against malicious attackers which is why the IOTA Foundation decided not to use it. Instead the IOTA Foundation decided to augment the leaderless consensus mechanism called, "Random neighbors majority consensus (RMC)" which is similar to SMC although, the nodes in which their opinions are queries is randomized. They took RMC then augmented it to create FPC by having the threshold of majority be a random number generated from a Decentralized Random Number Generator (dRNG). For FPC, the first sound is the same,
formula_1
For success rounds though,
formula_11
Where formula_12 where formula_13, is a randomized threshold for majority. Randomizing the threshold for majority makes it extremely difficult for adversaries to manipulate the consensus by either making it converge to a specific value or prolonging consensus. Note that FPC is only utilized to form consensus on a transaction during a double spend.
Ultimately, IOTA uses Fast Probabilistic Consensus for consensus and uses Proof of Work as a rate controller. Because IOTA does not use PoW for consensus, its overall network and energy per transaction is extremely small.
Applications and testbeds.
Proof-of-concepts building on IOTA technology are being developed in the automotive and IoT industry by corporates as Jaguar Land Rover, STMicroelectronics and Bosch. IOTA is a participant in smart city testbeds, to establish digital identity, waste management and local trade of energy. In project Alvarium, formed under the Linux Foundation, IOTA is used as an immutable storage and validation mechanism. The privacy centered search engine Xain uses IOTA as a trust anchor for its aggregated AI model.
On 11 February 2020, the Eclipse Foundation and IOTA Foundation jointly launched the Tangle EE (Enterprise Edition) Working Group. Tangle EE is aimed at enterprise users that can take IOTA technology and enable larger organizations to build applications on top of the project, where the Eclipse Foundation will provide a vendor-neutral governance framework .
Announcements of partners were critically received. In 2017, IOTA released the data marketplace, a pilot for a market where connected sensors or devices can store, sell or purchase data. The data marketplace was received critically by the cryptocurrency community over the extent of the involvement of the participants of the data marketplace, suggesting that "the IOTA Foundation was actively asking publications to use Microsoft’s name following the data marketplace announcement.". Izabelle Kaminska criticized a Jaguar press release: "our interpretation is that it's very unlikely Jaguar will be bringing a smart-wallet-enabled marketplace any time soon."
Criticism.
IOTA promises to achieve the same benefits that blockchain-based DLTs bring - decentralization, distribution, immutability and trust - but remove the downsides of wasted resources associated with mining as well as transaction costs. However, several of the design features of IOTA are unusual, and it is unclear whether they work in practice.
The security of IOTA's consensus mechanism against double-spending attacks is unclear, as long as the network is immature. Essentially, in the IoT, with heterogeneous devices having varying levels of low computational power, sufficiently strong computational resources will render the tangle insecure. This is a problem in traditional proof-of-work blockchains as well, however, they provide a much greater degree of security through higher fault tolerance and transaction fees. At the beginning, when there is a lower number of participants and incoming transactions, a central coordinator is needed to prevent an attack on the IOTA tangle.
Critics have opposed role of the coordinator for being the single source of consensus in the IOTA network. Polychain Capital founder Olaf Carlson-Wee, says "IOTA is not decentralized, even though IOTA makes that claim, because it has a central "coordinator node" that the network needs to operate. If a regulator or a hacker shut down the coordinator node, the network would go down." This was demonstrated during the Trinity attack incident, when the IOTA foundation shutdown the coordinator to prevent further thefts. Following a discovered vulnerability in October 2017, the IOTA foundation transferred potentially compromised funds to addresses under its control, providing a process for users to later apply to the IOTA Foundation in order to reclaim their funds. 
Additionally, IOTA has seen several network outages as a result of bugs in the coordinator as well as DDoS attacks. During the seed generator scam, a DDoS network attack was abused leaving initial thefts undetected.
In 2020, the IOTA Foundation announced that it would like to operate the network without a coordinator in the future, but implementation of this is still in an early development phase.

Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs

Ancient Egyptian afterlife beliefs were centered around a variety of complex rituals that were influenced by many aspects of Egyptian culture. Religion was a major contributor, since it was an important social practice that bound all Egyptians together. For instance, many of the Egyptian gods played roles in guiding the souls of the dead through the afterlife. With the evolution of writing, religious ideals were recorded and quickly spread throughout the Egyptian community. The solidification and commencement of these doctrines were formed in the creation of afterlife texts which illustrated and explained what the dead would need to know in order to complete the journey safely.
Egyptian religious doctrines included three afterlife ideologies: belief in an underworld, eternal life, and rebirth of the soul. The underworld, also known as the Duat, had only one entrance that could be reached by traveling through the tomb of the deceased. The initial image a soul would be presented with upon entering this realm was a corridor lined with an array of fascinating statues, including a variation of the hawk-headed god, Horus. The path taken to the underworld may have varied between kings and common people. After entry, spirits were presented to another prominent god, Osiris. Osiris would determine the virtue of the deceased's soul and grant those deemed deserving a peaceful afterlife. The Egyptian concept of 'eternal life' was often seen as being reborn indefinitely. Therefore, the souls who had lived their life elegantly were guided to Osiris to be born again.
In order to achieve the ideal afterlife, many practices had to be performed during one's life. This may have included acting justly and following the beliefs of Egyptian creed. Additionally, the Egyptians stressed the rituals completed after an individual's life has ended. In other words, it was the responsibility of the living to carry out the final traditions required so the dead could promptly meet their final fate. Ultimately, maintaining high religious morals by both the living and the dead, as well as complying to a variety of traditions guaranteed the deceased a smoother transition into the underworld.
Funeral practices.
There were many challenges the dead had to face before they were able to enter into the final stages of the afterlife. However, through the support of the living, the dead had access to the protection and knowledge they would need to be reborn in the netherworld.
Tombs.
The design and scale of Egyptian burial tombs varied from period to period, even though their function remained the same. While most tombs were built during the lifetime of the person it was meant for, Egyptian tombs were constructed to house the body of the dead, but also functioned to transmit the soul to the underworld. Most of what was found in a tomb depended on the status of the person buried within it. However, in order to assist the dead, most tombs were decorated with texts meant to help guide the deceased's soul to the afterlife, something that was attainable to all.
Afterlife texts.
Throughout the centuries, the Egyptian people decorated their tombs and coffins with religious spells and texts hoping to help the dead in the afterlife. As Egyptian culture developed, these texts also evolved and became more complex and extensive in nature.
Pyramid Texts.
The Pyramid Texts were the first religious spells to be carved into the walls of royal ancient Egyptian pyramids. Beginning in the Old Kingdom period, these texts were used exclusively by the Egyptian pharaohs to decorate the walls of their tombs. However, Egyptian Queens and high-ranking government officials soon began to use Pyramid Texts in their burial tombs as well. The purpose of these texts were to help the pharaoh successfully complete his journey through the afterlife, by conveying knowledge to the deceased about the paths he should take and the dangers he might face along the way.
Coffin Texts.
In the Middle Kingdom period the Pyramid Texts were replaced by the Coffin Texts. The Coffin Texts were spells that were inscribed into the coffins of the dead. They were meant to protect the deceased in the afterlife and provide them with the transformation magic they would need along their journey. These Coffin Texts were generally more attainable, providing the common people of Egypt the opportunity to attain a proper afterlife. It is also important to note that the collection of Coffin Texts known as The Book of Two Ways functioned as the earliest manual to the afterlife.
Book of the Dead.
The Book of the Dead was an extensive collection of spells that included material from both the Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts. In the New Kingdom period, the Book of the Dead was normally recorded on papyrus. However, it could also be found on the tomb walls, coffins and the wrappings of mummies. Like the Coffin Texts, the spells illustrated within the Book of the Dead were used by everyone. These spells offered advice, protection and knowledge to the dead as they journeyed through the netherworld.
Books of the Netherworld.
The Books of the Netherworld contained multiple texts that provided the deceased with a description of the underworld and served as a guide to help the dead during their final journey. Since the deceased were often seen replicating the rebirth cycle of Ra as they traveled through the afterlife, these texts primarily focused on the second half of the sun god's journey, which took him through the underworld at night. The earlier Books of the Netherworld, which include the Amduat and the Book of Gates, divided their narratives into twelve parts, symbolizing the twelve hours the sun god spent in the underworld. Later books such as the Book of Caverns and the Book of the Earth used a more sectionalized approach when presenting their narratives. All of these books also contained complex illustrations of the netherworld, which could often be seen etched into coffins and the walls of burial tombs.
Books of the Sky.
The Books of Sky consisted of three afterlife texts titled, the Book of Nut, the Book of Day and the Book of Night. Carved into the ceiling of tombs these texts emphasized the role the goddess Nut played in the Egyptian afterlife.
Coffins.
Coffins in Egyptian culture date back to the Old Kingdom. During this era, coffins were relatively simple; they were equilateral makings with minor details. These included three openings, one that the Ka was intended to pass through and two that represented eyes. However, as time passed coffins and their structures evolved. By the New Kingdom, coffins had not only become more popular around the area but were distributed for sale. The deceased's body was now represented by the coffin as it held a shape and was decorated with features that resembled the individual inside it. The deceased were also often depicted in white clothes, because it represented the soul's purity after it had passed through judgement, in the Hall of Maat. Additionally, the orientation of the deceased was very important to ancient Egyptians. In early periods, the body would have laid promptly on their side with their head directed to the south. This later shifted and with the body flat on its back, the north became a more favorable position for the dead's head to lie.
Mummification.
Mummification was a practice that the ancient Egyptians adopted because they believed that the body needed to be preserved in order for the dead to be reborn in the afterlife. Initially, Egyptians thought that like Ra, their physical bodies, or Khat, would reawaken after they completed their journey through the underworld. Once the Egyptians realized that the bodies of their dead would eventually decay, they started to see the remains of the dead as a vessel for the deceased's spirit. The body was dismembered and wrapped in bandages to safeguard it, if the soul decided to return.
Funeral offerings.
Many Egyptians considered the tomb to be a home for the dead, so it was customary to leave offerings near the body of the deceased. Egyptians believed that even after death, one's spirit would live on because the life force was a separate entity that could detach itself from the body. This life force was called the "Ka", and was considered to be one part of what the Egyptian believed to be the immortal soul. The "Ba" was another part of the soul that had increased mobility and dwelled within the Ka. Offerings that were left for the dead included clothing and valuable ornaments; the most important offering, however, was food, because even though the Ka was separated from the body, it could still starve.
Journey to the afterlife.
Ancient Egyptians theorized the passage to the afterlife in a series of stages. The first phase was believed to encompass the vehicle of transportation, which would eventually direct their departed souls to immortality. Individuals were subjected to a multitude of passages; but the choice of route was not theirs, it was dependent on their status. The aspect that was most universally influential in determining what passage was taken was one's position among their leaders. Despite the differences between voyagers, beliefs concerning the afterlife were highly reliant on religious ideologies. For example, early people often used religion to understand, as well as relate to natural occurrences since science had not yet defined everyday incidents. To demonstrate, there was no justification for the sun's orbit, so religious myths redefined and answered the questions prehistoric people had. Yet, since natural incidences were explained by religious beliefs, other realms of creed mimicked the natural patterns of life. For instance, the general ideology associated with the path to the underworld was believed that as night overshadowed the land, the deceased would begin their journey. And with the rising of the sun, a new day was not only thought to have begun, but a new life as well.
Boat passages to the underworld were strictly reserved for pharaohs who had died. The Egyptian sun god, Ra, was believed to travel to the underworld by boat as the sun set. As a way to mimic Ra's daily expedition, the ancient people of Egypt would construct model boats, ranging in many sizes in which they would bury alongside their pharaohs. For example, next to the Pyramid of Khufu, researchers uncovered Khufu ship, a boat the size of traditional ships, which displayed not only the extreme devotion Egyptians had for their leader, but their dedication to obtaining eternity for all. In other words, a great deal of the requirements for the deceased to properly reach the underworld rested on the living. In order for pharaohs to arrive at their final destination, his people had to construct a variety of boats to ensure his departure. As a result, communities had to come together to support each other, otherwise their perspective of immortality, as well as their beliefs would end indefinitely. Therefore, commitment to helping others achieve eternity was a vital component to Egyptian culture, as demonstrated by the gallant boats buried with their rulers.
Additionally, an alternate vehicle for entrance to the underworld was the coffin. While kings often used coffins in addition to, or in substitution of the boat belief, everyday citizens had less choice. Therefore, this method was more universal while alluding to a different, more frequent path of entry. To compare, while passages by boat directed the deceased to the sun god Ra, coffins were thought to guide individuals to the sky goddess Nut. Each coffin was uniquely attributed to the person who rested in it. In other words, every coffin was subject to a variety of interpretations, all of which were intended to promote the deceased in obtaining eternity.
However, not all who died were presented with the opportunity to travel to the underworld. Since the living were obligated to ensure that the deceased could travel to the afterlife, it was also in their control to eliminate one's chance in achieving eternity. Therefore, the living had an array of options that prevented a second life to an unworthy individual who had died. The most famous included decapitation, which when executed, "killed a person twice". As a result, the second death associated with decapitation was also assumed to have annihilated the chance at another life. As noted in Egyptian texts, this instance was incredibly feared, but happened most often to those who rebelled or disobeyed the king.
Judgement of the dead.
To the ancient Egyptians, the judgment of the dead was the process that allowed the Egyptian gods to judge the worthiness of the souls of the deceased. Deeply rooted in the Egyptian belief of immortality, judgment was one of the most important parts of the journey through the afterlife. As such, many variations of judgment scenes appear in the Egyptian afterlife texts. Each soul that entered the afterlife was handled individually during judgment. Once the deceased finished their journey through the underworld, they arrived at the Hall of Maat. Here their purity would be the determining factor in whether they would be allowed to enter the Kingdom of Osiris.
The deceased's first task was to correctly address each of the forty-two Assessors of Maat by name, while reciting the sins they did not commit during their lifetime. This process allowed the dead to demonstrate that they knew each of the judges’ names or Ren and established that they were pure, and free of sin. After confirming that they were sinless, the deceased was presented with the balance that was used to weigh their heart against the feather of Maat. Anubis was the god often seen administering this test. If the deceased's heart balanced with the feather of Maat, Thoth would record the result and they would be presented to Osiris, who admitted them into the Sekhet-Aaru. However, if their heart was heavier than the feather, it was to be devoured by the Goddess Ammit, permanently destroying the soul of the deceased.
Rebirth.
There were numerous ways for Egyptians to secure their fate. Many of the actions Egyptian people took after death were to influence the god's decision in allowing for another life. 
After judgement, entities were thought to return to the Mother Goddess' womb. During this stage, the soul meets its former body that is restored. To demonstrate, in the Book of Dead there is a series of lines that read as follows, "I unite your limbs, I hold your discharges together, I surround your flesh, I drive away the fluids of your decay, I sweep away your "b3w", I wipe away your tears, I heal all your limbs, each being united with the other; I surround you with the work of the weaving goddess, I complete you and form you as Re." The belief continues as the nude being approaches the Goddess and enters her womb as her son. To compare, this dogma is deeply related to the birth of the sun god Ra, who enters the goddess's womb every night, and is reborn as the sun rises. Ra's relation to the afterlife is very connected through the religious components that justify the rising and setting of the sun.
Ultimately, the immortality desired by ancient Egyptians was reflected in endless lives. By doing worthy deeds in their current life, they would be granted a second life for all of eternity.
Gender.
According to Egyptologist Katherine M. Cooney, ancient Egyptian women were forced to redefine their gender by encompassing more masculine features. Osiris, who was the ultimate ruler of the underworld, was applauded for his incredible superiority as a result of his virility. Additionally, the overall theme associated with gods connected their male attributes to resurrection, and goddesses were much more vigilant. This ideology was conspired from original doctrines, which denoted the overall creator a male. Statues and other forms of display made significant notice of their creator's masculine qualities, more specifically pointing out his erect penis. Therefore, to appease their god's preferences women's tombs and coffins displayed male qualities. Examples of male modifications included name combinations, in which women engraved "Osiris" before their own name on their coffins. This demonstrated the collaboration of women and a god who was capable of rebirth, because alone her sex restricted her. These displays of gender transformation are just one of many ways that people of today are able to identify the idea of rebirth after death in Egyptian practices.
Sekhet-Aaru.
Sekhet-Aaru, the "Field of Reeds", was the final destination for all souls who had been granted rebirth. This concept evolved in the Fifth Dynasty. Sekhet-Aaru was essentially thought to be paradise and encompassed this visualization. The Field of Reeds was visualized as a very lush region, filled with waterfalls among other natural wonders. Egyptian images, such as the Papyrus of Nebseni, depicted the land as being divided into numerous sections. Each division was imagined to resemble island structures, in which travel by boat is necessary.
Those who were granted access to the Field of Reeds included both gods and righteous souls. The fertility of the land was greatly emphasized as this possessed two of the major rewards in obtaining immortality: access to the Nile, and the ability to farm foods. As a result, the deceased ate and drank the same delicacies devoured by their gods. In turn, this promoted the belief that by obtaining immortality, individuals also accumulated aspects that resembled gods. Additionally, a third notable honor of residing in Sekhet-Aaru was the means of communication. The deceased were able to convey thoughts to one another, the gods, and those they had previously lost.

Antipathella fiordensis

Antipathella fiordensis is a species of colonial coral in the order Antipatharia, the black corals, so named because their calcareous skeletons are black. It was first described as "Antipathes fiordensis" by the New Zealand zoologist Ken R. Grange in 1990, from material collected in the steep-sided fiords of Fiordland in the southeastern South Island, New Zealand. A 2001 revision of the Antipatheria put this species in the newly-created genus "Antipathella".
Description.
Black corals have flexible bushy or tree-like forms. They have black skeletons of dense, horny material, covered by a thin layer of living tissue from which the polyps project. Each polyp has six unbranched tentacles and a slit-shaped mouth, and is non-retractable. Normal tentacles are less than long, but this black coral can develop sweeper tentacles up to long, armed with stinging cells, in apparent response to epiphytic organisms attempting to grow on the branches. These corals do not contain zooxanthellae in their tissues and thus do not need to live in sunlit places.
"A. fiordensis" has a 50:50 sex ratio, with no obvious differences between the sexes. Colonies do not reach sexual maturity until they are about 0.7–1.0 m tall, aged at least 30 years. Female colonies produce between 1.3 million and nearly 17 million oocytes each year.
Distribution.
"Antipathella fiordensis" occurs in the seas around New Zealand at depths of from .
Ecology.
The fiords where "A. fiordensis" grows have nearly vertical rock walls, providing limited sites for attachment of organisms, so many other species live on these corals. One is the snake star "Astrobrachion constrictum", which perches and coils its arms tightly around the coral's branches. This snake star is found in a number of places around New Zealand, but always in association with a black coral. It seems to be a mutualistic arrangement: coral polyps are more efficient at catching prey than the unbranched arms of a snake star; the snake star appropriates some of the prey, while also cleaning mucus off the coral and preventing epizoic organisms from settling on it.

Neurolinguistic approach

The neurolinguistic approach is a pedagogical method used in acquiring/teaching second or foreign languages (abridged as L2/FL) in a school setting, singling out the ability to communicate, both orally and in writing. Originally, it was developed for the teaching of French, but there are now a variety of programs based on this approach for the teaching of several different languages. The most widely used program in Canada is that known as "Intensive French" (IF).
Context.
The NLA was developed in Canada by Claude Germain, of the Département de didactique des langues at the Université du Québec à Montréal, and Joan Netten, of the Faculty of Education at Memorial University of Newfoundland, in the context of the growing influence of emerging educational neurosciences. It draws principally from the research carried out by Michel Paradis (1994, 2004, 2009) of McGill University and by the Institut des sciences cognitives, Université du Québec à Montréal (UQAM), as well as by research conducted by Nick C. Ellis (Centre for Complex systems, University of Michigan). It is also influenced by Vygotsky’s concepts of social interaction (1997).
The NLA is characterised by the need to ensure the independent development, in a classroom setting, of both components of any effective communication: an implicit competence, or the ability to spontaneously use a L2/FL orally, and explicit knowledge, or the awareness of the way a language functions, its grammatical rules and its vocabulary. This dimension of the NLA is based on Paradis (1994, 2004) and Nick C. Ellis (2011). Paradis’s research makes a clear distinction between explicit knowledge, which is the conscious knowledge surrounding a L2/FL and which is learnt through noticing and explanations, and implicit competence, which can only be acquired non-consciously by using the language in authentic communicative situations.
In NLA, implicit competence is referred to as internal grammar. This internal grammar is formed of a network of neuronal connections formed in the brain by the frequent use of the same pathways or circuits; these are NOT rules, but a linguistic structure’s frequent statistical patterns (Paradis, 2004; Ellis, 2011). Furthermore, explicit knowledge is referred to in the NLA as external grammar. Paradis’s research shows that explicit knowledge (external grammar) is sustained by the declarative memory, while implicit competence (internal grammar), which is a skill, is sustained by the procedural memory (Germain et Netten, 2013a). According to Paradis, there is no direct connection between these two components. While external grammar is taught relatively effectively in the classroom, the same cannot be said of internal grammar. This is why conventional L2/FL teaching programs, generally based on current methods or approaches, cannot lead most students to acquire spontaneous communication in the language being taught. This is true even of programs which claim to use a communicative approach but which, despite its creators’ theoretical bases, first teach explicit knowledge (grammar rules or knowledge generally founded on written language) before the acquisition of implicit competence, which belongs to oral language (Germain et Netten, 2005, 2013b, Germain, 2017).
Paradis’s views have been challenged in some quarters; however, the co-conceptors of the NLA find them to be the most accurate/satisfactory descriptors of the SL acquisition/learning process.
Fundamental principles.
The NLA is based on five fundamental principles developed by Germain and Netten (2011, 2012a; Netten and Germain, 2012) to create the necessary classroom conditions for students to first learn spontaneous oral communication in their L2/FL, before moving on to explicit knowledge of the language in reading and writing activities (Germain et Netten 2013b; Germain, 2017).
Acquisition of internal grammar (implicit competence).
In order to create a classroom atmosphere where a limited number of linguistic structures are used and reused often enough to ensure that patterns, or neuronal connections, are developed in the students’ procedural memory, each teaching unit introduces three or four communicative functions which are related both to each other and to the unit’s theme. Each function is presented and used individually in several different situations allowing for brief personal conversations between the students. At the end of the unit, the functions are combined to permit more complex discussions on the subject. Thus, oral language is learnt in a conversational context. The importance of the context in permitting an effective transfer to other situations has been confirmed in Segalowitz’s recent work in cognitive neuroscience, in particular his concept of Transfer Appropriate Processing (TAP) (Segalowitz, 2010).
Recourse to a literacy-based perspective in teaching a L2/FL.
Literacy is usually understood as the ability to use a language to interpret and understand the environment. A literacy-based perspective allows the teacher to consider the acquisition of a language as the development of skills rather than of knowledge. This also means prioritising the development of oral skills, a view confirmed by recent research in neurodidactic science (Huc and Smith, 2008) which calls for the development of verbal communication before reading and writing. Texts used during the reading portion of the class, as well as the topics for written work, are based on the same theme and involve using the same structures first developed verbally. Reading and writing are taught directly in the L2/FL without recourse to translation. The strategies used are similar to those used for developing literacy when teaching the students their first language, but must be modified. For instance, a greater emphasis may be placed on oral preparation before reading and writing, which is essential when developing literacy in a L2/FL, given that the students’ internal grammar is considerably more limited than that of those who are learning to read and write in their first language (Germain et Netten, 2005, 2012, 2013b, Germain, 2017). A literacy-based approach also allows for external grammar to be brought into play after the language has been used orally and in context (observing grammatical details in the reading text and using these observed cases when writing paragraphs).
Recourse to a project-based approach.
In order for students to acquire an internal grammar, the focus must be on the message rather than on the language, as internal grammar can only be acquired unconsciously that is, without consciously paying attention to the language’s features (Paradis, 1994, 2004, 2009). To facilitate the creation of significant situations and interesting, cognitively challenging tasks for the students, the content of the teaching units is organised sequentially, going from a few mini projects to a final project. The suggested activities are therefore not isolated and require the students’ active participation, which calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are essential to successfully acquiring a language (Paradis, 2004). This type of organisation also allows each unit’s language structures to be used and reused, while allowing the teacher to help students to learn by gradually increasing the difficulty of both tasks and language structures.
Use of authentic communicative situations.
The ability to communicate spontaneously develops only through authentic communication. It cannot be learnt through controlled exercises or by memorising dialogues (R. Ellis, 1997) where the language thus learned is focused, foremost, on linguistic forms and is stored in the declarative memory. This type of activity does not permit the student to use the same structures sufficiently often to develop the patterns required to create implicit competence, or internal grammar, unconsciously. Moreover, only authentic communication calls on other cerebral mechanisms that are necessary for acquisition to happen, such as those linked to motivation (Paradis, 2004). In the NLA, all classroom communication is authentic: the teacher does not ask unrealistic questions and the students’ answers are always personal. Communication always takes place in the L2/FL.
Use of interactive teaching strategies.
Interaction between students in the L2/FL is an essential ingredient for developing internal grammar and the ability to communicate spontaneously. To facilitate such interactions, the NLA applies five steps to teaching oral communication, throughout the teaching units, as well as encouraging activities carried out in pairs or in small-groups. On the linguistic level, the way is prepared for students to use the structures they require to accomplish the assigned tasks, but the interactions are authentic in that the students express their own thoughts. There are also three other specific teaching strategies recommended in using the NLA: fluency, accuracy, and purposeful listening. The students must reply in complete sentences when learning new language structures, in order to facilitate the building of their internal grammar and the ease with which they use the L2/FL. For internal grammar, accuracy is achieved by consistent and instant oral correction of errors and having the student reuse the correct structure orally. Essentially, in developing internal grammar, oral correction of errors replaces the teaching of grammar rules. Purposeful listening, meanwhile, replaces the usual oral comprehension exercises; it is a matter of encouraging learners to constantly listen to what the teacher and the other learners say" (Germain, 2017, p. 89). The NLA uses eight strategies for learning/teaching both reading and writing.
Currently (2018), there are several implementations of the NLA, notably the Intensive French (IF) program in Canada and a French language training program at a Chinese university. The Canadian IF, which is geared to 5th and 6th grade students (11/12 years old) and continues to the end of high school, was launched in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998. Since then, it has spread to almost all Canadian provinces and territories (the French-majority province of Québec has an intensive English program which, as it is not based on NLA principles, is similar but not identical to IF). Over 70,000 students have participated in the first year of the IF program in Canada since its inception. In China, the program is aimed at young adults (median age of 19) and was launched at the South China Normal University (Guangzhou) in 2010. It has attracted much interest from other Chinese institutions (including a high school) as well as in Japan (Gal Bailly, 2011; Ricordel, 2012), Taiwan, Iran, Belgium and France (Germain, 2017).
These programs were developed under the direction of the NLA’s co-developers. At this time, other implementations of the NLA are being developed in Canada by other professionals in order to teach certain First Nations languages in Yukon and the Northwest Territories, as well as in Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island, the James Bay region of Québec for the teaching of English, French and Cree, and the teaching of Mohawk, French and English to the Mohawk Nation which extends through the southern part of Ontario and Quebec and northern New York state. Programs in Spanish and Mandarin are also implemented in the Calgary Public School Board. Any curricular resource that conforms to NLA principles can be adapted to teach communication skills in any L2/FL, as suggested by a recent trial of teaching/learning Spanish among francophone Quebeckers in a university setting (specifically, at UQÀM, the Université du Québec à Montréal).

Milk Wars

"Milk Wars" is a 2018 American comic book crossover published by DC Comics. It features the publisher's core characters—such as Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman—crossing over with the characters of their imprint Young Animal.
Production.
According to Young Animal curator Gerard Way, the idea for a crossover between the main DC Comics line and Young Animal was proposed to him by DC. Way approved of the idea, saying he saw it as "a fun challenge, a way to reach mainstream readers, and hopefully a way to infect them with [Young Animal's] weirdness". Way, who considers Young Animal "a big experiment", was interested in reinventing DC's icons in ways that were fun. The inspiration for the series was how milk's wholesomeness could sometimes be a bad thing.
The creative teams for each issue were balanced between some individuals known for their work in Young Animal, and others known for their work in DC's main line. Each issue also features a backup story about the new character Eternity Girl by Magdalene Visaggio and Sonny Liew. Frank Quitely illustrated each issue's cover. "JLA/Doom Patrol Special"s cover references Grant Morrison's "All Star Superman", a series that Quitely previously contributed to.
Reception.
The series holds an average rating of 8.0 by 86 professional critics on the review aggregation website Comic Book Roundup.

Toriel

Toriel Dreemurr is a fictional character and boss in the role-playing video game "Undertale". A motherly figure created as an embodiment of excessive video game tutorials, she is a member of the monster race with hanging ears, small horns, white fur and a purple robe. Literally "hand-holding" the player through the opening sections of the game, the player must attempt to escape the area, upon which point they fight her. The player can choose to kill her or convince her to stop fighting, having implications on the game at large. 
The character has received attention from critics and fans for her personality as well as the atypical moral choice of her boss battle. A version of the character also appears in "Deltarune".
Characteristics.
"Undertale".
The player meets Toriel shortly after they fall into the Underground, where she is seen as a motherly figure who desires to protect the player from its dangers. She teaches the player the mechanics of the game, encouraging them to show mercy to enemies rather than attack them. Giving the player a phone with which to contact her, she leaves the player on their own to figure out the rest of the Ruins, after which they arrive at her house. 
While she attempts to take care of the player, they become restless and attempt to leave the Ruins. Having seen several human children die at the hands of the monster king Asgore, she fears for the player's safety and confronts them in battle. If the player chooses not to kill her, the battle is "long and arduous" with little indication that the player's tactics are working until she relents. In fact, she must be spared many times in order to persuade her to allow the player to leave the Ruins. If Toriel is killed after she relents, however, she tells the player that she realized she regrets trying to have raised the player.
It is later revealed that Toriel was once Asgore's wife, Toriel Dreemurr, and they had a son, Asriel Dreemurr. When Asriel died, she gave up her crown due to her disagreement with Asgore over his willingness to kill human children to break the seal holding the monsters underground.
Near the end of the True Pacifist route, Toriel arrives at "New Home" (The Monsters' Capital) and saves the human from Asgore. However, Flowey appears and absorbs her soul along with all the other monsters in the Underground to regain his true form, Asriel. Later, after the player has fought Asriel, and he has broken the barrier, Toriel and the other monsters leave the Underground. Toriel offers to provide a home for the human; the player can choose to accept or reject this. In the non-playable pacifist epilogue we see that Toriel has achieved her dream of founding and teaching a school.
"Deltarune".
In "Deltarune", Toriel is the adoptive mother of Kris and biological mother of Asriel. She wakes up Kris at the beginning of the game and drops them off at school. After returning from the Dark World, Kris receives a call from Toriel, who tells them that they are in trouble for being late. However, she seems pleased to hear that Kris has made a friend, and allows Kris to explore the town before coming home. She later appears when Kris returns home. It is hinted in the game that Toriel works as a teacher for a younger class at Kris' school.
Development.
Toriel was initially envisioned by the game's creator, Toby Fox, as a "tutorial person that can't stand to see you leave". She was later incorporated as the final boss of the game's demo, which was used to promote its successful Kickstarter campaign.
Merchandise.
An official Toriel plush was released by "Fangamer". The plush contains a white heart soul inside, which can only be found if the plush is cut apart. This detail reflects her death scene in "Undertale", and was described by Kotaku as "weirdly unsettling". A figure of Toriel was also released by Fangamer as part of a set.
Reception.
Jess Joho of "Kill Screen" called the character "relying on the inhumanly selfless portrait of motherhood", but doing so with a purpose, praising the boss encounter with her as respecting the player's ability to think through a problem, as well as their basic instincts as a human being. She stated that the game holds up a mirror to "patriarchal" game design that encourages players to impatiently "sacrifice their own mother and humanity" rather than engaging with the enemy on a "human level".
Nathan Grayson of "Kotaku" stated that while he killed Toriel during his playthrough, his encounter with her made him cry due to her friendliness and relatability as a character. He also praised the game for remembering this on his next playthrough. Jack de Quidt of "Rock, Paper, Shotgun" called the tutorial sequence featuring her "beautifully paced" and praised the character, saying "Toriel's all right", while Richard Cobbett of the same site called her sprite animations "understated but effective".
Julie Muncy of "Kill Screen" criticized the encounter with Toriel as unintuitive, saying that she lost the ability to trust the game after being seemingly forced to kill Toriel, which forced her onto the game's "Neutral" route.

2019 European Parliament election in Croatia

The 2019 European Parliament election in Croatia were held on 26 May 2019, electing members of the national Croatia constituency to the European Parliament. These were the third such elections in the country since its accession to the European Union in 2013.
It was the first election to be held nationally since the 2016 parliamentary election, following which the center-right HDZ had formed a coalition government, first with the center-right MOST and later - in June 2017, with the centrist HNS. The European Parliament elections were therefore viewed as a major test for the center-left SDP, which had contested all previous nationwide elections since 2011 as part of a coalition, but chose to stand in this election alone. The elections as such was deemed important to showcase whether the SDP could remain the largest opposition party, having been faced with months of falling opinion poll ratings. Its main contenders for such a position within the political system were the anti-establishment, eurosceptic Živi zid party, and the newly formed center-left Amsterdam Coalition. 
The election resulted in the two largest parties in the country, the ruling centre-right HDZ, and the opposition centre-left SDP, winning an equal number of seats - each taking 4. SDP won in all four of the largest Croatian cities: Zagreb, Split, Rijeka and Osijek. The remaining four seats were evenly divided between the right-wing Croatian Sovereignists coalition, the centre-left Amsterdam Coalition, the anti-establishment Živi zid party and the independent list led by jurist Mislav Kolakušić. The strong performance of right-wing and far-right parties, such as the Croatian Sovereignists coalition and Independents for Croatia-HSP coalition, is thought to have greatly contributed to the surprisingly poor result of the HDZ, notably by significantly reducing its support among members of the Croatian diaspora, who had registered a record turnout in this election. Another surprise in the elections was the large number of votes received by Zagreb jurist Mislav Kolakušić and his independent list - which was something not predicted by opinion polls, as well as the failures of MOST to attain a seat and of independent incumbent MEP Marijana Petir to retain her seat (which she had held since 2014).
At the previous election in 2014, Croatia was allocated 11 seats and is set to receive one additional seat following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU. All seats were up for election and the whole country forms a single constituency, with the 12 members elected by proportional representation using open lists and the D'Hondt method.
Campaign.
A total of 33 valid candidate slates with 396 candidates were submitted for the upcoming European Parliament election. The lists were published by the State Election Commission on 10 April, when the official election campaign began that will last for 45 days.
Croatian Democratic Union.
The slate of the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the ruling centre-right party of Croatia and member of the European People's Party (EPP), was led by 30-year-old Karlo Ressler, who was nominated by the youth branch of the party. The slate also includes two current MEPs, three members of the Croatian Parliament, and two county prefects. The party platform for the election was called "Croatia for Generations". Croatian Prime Minister and HDZ President Andrej Plenković said that the election is a choice between a political course of Croatia's development and a backward course that would isolate Croatia. The main campaign rally of the HDZ, held in Zagreb, was attended by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Manfred Weber, EPP's candidate for European Commission (EC) President. Both of them urged voters to reject nationalism in the upcoming election.
Social Democratic Party of Croatia.
The slate of the main opposition party, the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) of the Party of European Socialists (PES), was led by current MEP Tonino Picula. While presenting the party list, Picula said that Croatia had not taken full advantage of its membership in the EU. The SDP was expecting to win three seats in the upcoming election. The campaign event in Rijeka, where the SDP is in power, was attended by Frans Timmermans, the candidate of the PES for president of the EC, alongside SDP President Davor Bernardić. Bernardić accused the HDZ for "failing to salvage" the Croatian shipyards in Rijeka and Pula, in cooperation with the EC.
Amsterdam Coalition.
The list of the Amsterdam Coalition, a coalition of seven parties, including the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Civic Liberal Alliance (GLAS), and the Istrian Democratic Assembly (IDS), was headed by Istria County prefect Valter Flego of the IDS. GLAS President Anka Mrak Taritaš presented the list as a rejection of a "Europe of barbed wire fences and the Brexit chaos", and said that the coalition advocates an open and free Europe. HSS President Krešo Beljak said that the vote for the coalition is a vote for a European Croatia.
Živi zid.
The populist Živi zid party announced a joint platform with Italy's Five Star Movement, Kukiz'15 from Poland, and Greece's AKKEL. The 1st candidate on the slate of the Živi zid was its secretary-general Tihomir Lukanić. Ivan Vilibor Sinčić, the president of the party, presented the platform as a new generation of politicians that will fight against corruption and organised crime.
Bridge of Independent Lists.
The slate of the Bridge of Independent Lists (Most) was led by its president, Božo Petrov. If elected, Petrov would have given up his seat in the European Parliament to the next candidate with most preferential votes. Prior to the start of the campaign, the Most party attempted to filibuster a bill that would increase the spending limits for the European election, but the bill was passed by the Croatian Parliament just before the deadline. The party has not joined any of the European political groups and announced the work within the non-affiliated Non-Inscrits.
Independents for Croatia–Croatian Party of Rights.
Two right-wing parties, the Independents for Croatia (NHR) and the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), formed a coalition and emphasized a Europe of "free, sovereign and independent nations" as the main agenda. Their slate included both parties' presidents, Bruna Esih of the NHR and Karlo Starčević of the HSP.
Croatian Sovereignists.
The Croatian Sovereignists coalition was formed by four right-wing parties: the Croatian Conservative Party (HKS), the Croatian Growth (Hrast), the Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starčević (HSP AS), and the United Croatian Patriots (UHD). Its list was led by current MEP Ruža Tomašić of the HKS, who won a mandate in 2013 and in 2014 on the HDZ-led Patriotic Coalition slate.
Independent Democratic Serb Party.
The Independent Democratic Serb Party (SDSS), the largest party of the Serbs of Croatia, ran independently for the first time in the European election. Although there were speculations that the SDSS might leave the ruling coalition, its leader Milorad Pupovac confirmed that the SDSS will remain a part it, following a meeting with Prime Minister Plenković. Campaign was marked by SDSS jumbo posters with inscription "Do you know how it is to be a Serb in Croatia?" in which a word Serb was written in Serbian Cyrillic. Jović was second on the list, just behind party leader Milorad Pupovac. As it was expected by campaign leaders jumbo posters were target of widespread nationalist vandalism and destruction which underlined the issue of ethnic intolerance and discrimination.
Other electoral lists.
The Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS–LD), the junior partner in the governing coalition, also ran independently, with Međimurje County Prefect Matija Posavec leading the list.
Current MEP Marijana Petir, who was elected in 2014 on the HDZ-led coalition slate, ran as an independent candidate, with a campaign focused on agrarian issues.
Polls.
The following graph depicts the evolution of standings of the two main political parties and other parties in the poll since the parliamentary elections 2003.
Results.
The ruling HDZ won 22.72% of the vote and 4 seats in the European Parliament. The SDP, the main opposition party, also won 4 seats in the parliament, with 18.71% of the popular vote. The SDP will gain the fourth seat after the United Kingdom leaves the EU. The Croatian Soverignists coalition, the independent list of Mislav Kolakušić, the Živi Zid party, and the Amsterdam Coalition won one seat each. The voter turnout was 29.9%, up from 25.2% in the 2014 election.
Prime Minister Plenković admitted that he expected more votes. The elected MEP's of the HDZ list are Karlo Ressler, Dubravka Šuica, Tomislav Sokol and Željana Zovko. SDP President Davor Bernardić was satisfied with the results, which exceeded his expectations. The elected MEP's of the SDP are Biljana Borzan, Tonino Picula, Predrag Fred Matić and Romana Jerković. Jerković will take her seat after Brexit. Ruža Tomašić of the Croatian Sovereignists won the highest number of preferential votes and retained her seat in the parliament. The biggest surprise of the election was Kolakušić's independent list, which won 7.89% of the vote. Kolakušić announced a presidential campaign the day after the election.
Ivan Vilibor Sinčić, the president of the Živi zid party, won most preferential votes on his party list and a place in the parliament ahead of the slate leader, Tihomir Lukanić. The Amsterdam Coalition's main candidate, Valter Flego, won a seat in the parliament.

Bray Wilkins

Bray Wilkins (probably pronounced based on contemporaneous spelling "Brey Wilkeens"; 1610 – 1 January 1702) was a Welsh immigrant, patriarch, and founder of Middleton, Massachusetts. Bray's origins aren't concretely known and are supplanted (and probably distorted) by familial tradition, however his reputation was already prolific in the Massachusetts Bay Colony decades before his death. His progeny, the Wilkins family, had a strong presence in the area. Bray and his family were prominent figures in some Salem Witch Trials.
Early life.
Very little is known about Bray's life before emigrating to the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is known from his own admission and other records which required such information that Bray was born about 1610, in Wales. Where in Wales he was born is up for debate, it is sometimes suggested he was born in Brecknockshire, however, this is based on the mistaken assumption that Bray was a descendant of the lord John Wilkins, who married the sister of Oliver Cromwell, the fact that John Wilkins was born more than four years "after" Bray often overlooked. The authors of several historical works on old Salem and New England make significantly similar claims that Bray was a descendant, in varying forms, of the lordly Wilkins families in Wales. William C. Hill states it is "quite likely" that Bray heralded from one of these Wilkins families, whose presence in Wales is well attested. That being said, Bray's immediate origins are still nonetheless a mystery. "Thorough inquiry" conducted by English and Welsh genealogical authorities have found no definite trace of Bray "or" his immediate ancestors.
Immigration and life in Massachusetts.
Regardless of his origins, Bray arrived in the Thirteen Colonies around 1630, his first residence being recorded as Lynn, Massachusetts. He is first mentioned in a parchment dated January 16, 1632 which describes the allotment of 16 acres of Dorchester to him. He is registered as have taken the Oath of a Freeman on May 14, 1634.
Bray was known by the community as a model citizen: upright, pious, and adored. In 1659, Bray and his partner John Gengell (of uncertain relations, see below) leased 700 acres of land eight to ten miles northwest of Salem, which became the town of Danvers, and later Middleton. A controversial mortgage claim lead to Bray and Gengell being brought to court in 1666.
Salem Witch Trials.
In 1689, Bray and his family, along with several others, moved from Salem proper to establish a church in Danvers. Around 1690, Bray's granddaughter by his son Thomas, Margaret, married a man by the name of John Willard. Willard acted as a constable for the court, and given Bray's legal misfortunes decades prior, the family disapproved of him immediately after it was announced Margaret and John were eloped. The two lived a rather normal life for several years, all the while the Wilkins family did not shy away from making it known how they disapproved of John. During the first weeks of the Salem Witch Trials in spring 1692, paranoia and mania swept through Danvers. Willard, being a constable, at times found himself ordered to arrest townspeople he held in high regard. His refusal to arrest accused witches lead to himself being accused of witchcraft, and on May 10 of the same year a warrant for Willard's arrest was ratified. Willard fled to Nashaway, where he was discovered following the issue of a second warrant for his arrest. Willard was put on trial on May 18, during which Bray Wilkins testified that he had been inflicted with a very painful condition after Willard had given him a stare, recounting, "[Willard] lookt after such a sort upon me as I never before discerned in any." Indeed, a kidney stone had begun to afflict Bray after he had encountered Willard in the middle of a meal some days before in Dorchester with Willard, Henry Wilkins Jr. and Deodat Lawson. Bray was ill for several days and remained in Boston during this time. Once he returned to Danvers, Bray discovered that his grandson Daniel was horribly ill. Mercy Lewis, Ann Putnam Jr and Mary Walcott were called to investigate the possibility of witchcraft, and they affirmed Willard was responsible for the boy's fatal illness and Bray's own health problems. Thomas was mortified at the proceedings against his son-in-law, and refused to take part in the trial. Two of Bray's daughters and several others gave second-hand testimony that John Willard had beaten his wife Margaret and then exhibited odd behavior which frightened her into running to a relative's house for safety. During his examination, he denied these allegations with the rest, and desired that his wife would be called to testify on his behalf, but this does not appear to have been done. Indeed, no such frenzy is known to have occurred at any point, Margaret and John shared three children and lived a modest life. Regardless, the testimony of the Wilkins family was damning, and Willard was found guilty and hanged for witchcraft that August.
Death.
Bray Wilkins died in January 1702, at age 92. His burial place is not known, though legend places in on the original foundations of Danvers/Middleton that he and Gengell built, today known as "Will's Hill", also where he died.
Marriage and descendants.
Bray was only married once, the wedding probably taking place between 1632 and 1636. Per William C. Hill, Bray Wilkins had eight children:
Hill lists the eighth child as one James Wilkins ( 1655 – ?), however, it is unlikely James was actually a son of Bray; Bray mentioned neither James nor his heirs in his will, nor did he give James land, as he did his known sons, and no one named "James" was at any time associated with any of Bray's family. John Gengell left legacies to all Bray's children in his will, but James is not mentioned here either. 
Bray's wife: Hannah Gengell or Hannah Way?
The identity of Bray Wilkins' wife isn't known, but there are two candidates: Hannah Way and Hannah Gengell. Hannah Gengell is proposed to have been the sister of Bray's lifelong partner John Gengell. Neither candidate has more evidence favoring their identification over the other, however it is more likely Bray married Hannah Way as opposed to Hannah Gengell. Any mention of Bray's wife simply refers to her as "Hannah" or "Anna" and no mention of her maiden name is ever recorded in the sparse times she is ever mentioned. No record of her death is known to exist. 
William C. Hill's "The Family of Bray Wilkins, Patriarch of Will's Hill", states "Bray Wilkins' wife was probably Hannah Gengell. There is no record of the marriage to be found, which probably occurred at Dorchester between 1632 and 1636, for on the latter date Hannah Wilkins, the wife of Bray, is recorded as having been received into the First Church in Dorchester... Hannah Gengell was the sister of John Gengell, one of the incorporators of Taunton, Massachusetts, in 1643." Two persons who had access to much early documentary material about the Wilkins family, now lost, Martha J. Averill and Emily Ann Milliken née Wilkins, maintained that Bray's wife was Hannah Gengell, and furthermore the Wilkins are described with familial kindness in John Gengell’s will dated 10 April 1685.
However, a 1984 article from The American Genealogist written by David L. Greene disputes the identification of Bray's wife as a Gengell by pointing out apparent errors in Hill's work. Greene claimed Hill's main piece of support, John Gengell's will, makes the conclusion impossible, as Gengell called himself 70 in that document, and thus about 21 when Bray married Hannah (though "why" this fact makes it impossible for the wife of Bray Wilkins to be Hannah Gengell is suspiciously unexplained). Though Greene acknowledges that it is difficult to escape the inference that Bray and John Gengell were in some way related, he advances the following arguments: Henry Way arrived at Nantasket in 1630 (meaning he was in New England when Bray was). Emigration records record that he made the journey with his wife Elizabeth and children Samuel, Richard, Henry, and Susanna. However, as later documents would make evident, Henry Way had at least one more child who emigrated to America with him, a son named Aaron. Greene suggests this seemingly missing entry for his son Aaron Way could mean that another of Henry Way's children may very well have gone undocumented just as Aaron did. Additionally, Bray purportedly sold land to what he called his "trusty kinsman" in May 1675, one of whom was clarified as Aaron Way. Furthermore, during his testimony against Willard in 1692, Bray called Richard Way, his theoretical brother-in-law, his 'brother'. Greene also mentions one of Bray’s sons was named ‘Henry’, which he postulates was intended as the namesake of Hannah Way’s father. However, there is no reason to think that other relationships couldn’t explain the language. After all, members of a common social group might call themselves "brothers" or "cousins" without any actual blood or marital relationship. Still, it doesn’t help the case of the Gengell identification that Hannah Way is attested to while Hannah Gengell isn’t. John Gengell himself is only sparsely attested to, let alone a hypothetical sister of his, and even then, none of the surviving pieces that attest to his existence give an idea of his personal life. On the other hand, the Way family is very well documented; manuscript summaries of the parish registers for Bridport and Allington, Dorset, in the collection of the Rev. Richard Grosvenor Bartelot, show that Henry Way married Elizabeth Batchelar on 22 Jan. 1615, (apparently as his second wife) and that they had a daughter "Hanah" who was baptized there on 3 March 1616. Additionally, while it is true and evident in John Gengell’s will that he regarded the Wilkins very highly, he very explicitly avoids calling them relatives. Coincidentally, Aaron Way is also mentioned alongside a “Mary Way” as a witness in the will.
Clarence Almon Torrey, in his 6,000 page index to what is estimated to be 99% of marriages performed in 17th century New England, asserts that Bray's wife was Hannah Way.

Luís Pimenta (football manager)

Luís Berkemeier Pimenta (born 25 September 1981) is a Portuguese football manager.
Personal life.
Pimenta was born in Lisbon, Portugal to a Portuguese father and a German mother. At the age of 5, he moved to Luxembourg with his family.
Managerial career.
At 15, Pimenta decided that he wanted to pursue a career as a football manager, and completed all his UEFA training courses. From Luxembourg he returned to the Portuguese capital to study human kinetics at the university. During his degree course, he went to Liverpool to learn psychology and football science, as well as deepen his knowledge of English. Back in Portugal, he met Gonçalo Pereira, destined to be his deputy for the years to come. After finishing the course, Pimenta and Pereira entered the technical staff of Rui Jorge at Belenenses. At the same time, Pimenta worked at the Academia Carlos Queiroz in Carnaxide.
In October 2011, Pimenta was invited to manage the youth academy of the Norwegian club of Hønefoss, being also an assistant for the first team, where they reached the best classification in the club's history in 2012, under the lead of Leif Gunnar Smerud. He became the assistant manager of Roar Johansen in 2014, but they were both released that year.
In September 2014, he became the manager of Kongsvinger replacing André Bergdølmo, where Pimenta got his first experience as head coach. He helped the team getting up from the 3. divisjon to the 2. Divisjon 20 points ahead of their closest rivals. The next year, Konsginver finished in fifth and qualified for the promotion playoffs and, more surprisingly, made the 2016 Norwegian Football Cup final, losing to Rosenborg BK. At the end of the season, he declined renewal offers and left the club.
After a year off, Pimenta became the head coach of the Swedish club IF Brommapojkarna in the 2018 Allsvenskan, after two seasons of successive promotions by Olof Mellberg. Again, he brought Gonçalo Pereira along as his deputy. In August 2018, some players came forward, although under anonymity, to reveal an alleged leadership influenced by racism, penalism and sexism. Despite an internal investigation concluding that the accusations were false, as stated since the beginning by Pimenta, him and his two assistants reached an agreement with the club for the termination of the contract. Two days after Pimenta’s departure, Brommapojkarna's sport’s director, Daniel Majstorovic, resigned, disagreeing with the way the club handled this situation, and emphasizing that the accusations were false. Pimenta signed with the Latvian club Riga in February 2019, but left a month later on 2 March.
In the summer of 2020 he was appointed as coach of Norway U18 and U19.

Polestar 1

The Polestar 1 is a 2-door plug-in hybrid sports car created by Polestar, performance company and brand of Volvo Cars, and is the first car produced by the company since becoming an independent car manufacturer in June 2017. Based on Volvo's Concept Coupé from 2013, the Polestar 1 is built on the Volvo Scalable Product Architecture platform and is powered by a hybrid powertrain, using a front-mounted engine and two electric motors at the rear. A limited production run has been capped to three years with a total of 1,500 units to be produced for the left-hand drive market only. Production is to take place in Chengdu, China, where the company's first production facility was built.
History.
The Polestar 1 started as Volvo's Concept Coupé from 2013, styled by German car designer Thomas Ingenlath, who previously worked in lead design positions at Audi, Volkswagen and Škoda. After the unveiling of the Concept Coupé, Ingenlath said that the model took inspiration from the Volvo P1800, stating that "it is a car designer’s duty to reflect and incorporate design signatures that are vital parts of the company’s heritage".
The Polestar 1 was unveiled on October 17, 2017 at the Shanghai Auto Show, making its world premiere and first public appearance. It came after several teasers were released from the company, including a video revealing the car's reveal date while a number of detail photographs were posted by the company's Instagram account from October 2 to 16, 2017.
In June of 2019, Polestar announced that the Polestar 1 was entering its final stages of development as a prototype, before production would officially commence in the later-unveiled production site in Chengdu, China.
In April of 2021, the final version of the Polestar 1 was unveiled at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show. This matte-gold Polestar 1 was designed to commemorate the final run of production and featured no difference to the original car other than the paint. Only 25 were made, with a USD$5,000 price increase over the base MSRP.
Design.
Powertrain.
The Polestar 1 is powered by a hybrid powertrain, using a twincharged 2.0 litre in-line four-cylinder gasoline motor from the Volvo XC90 T8 to power the front wheels, with an additional two electric motors powering the rear wheels. Amongst the petrol engine and batteries, an Integrated Starter Generator is also equipped to the Volvo Scalable Product Architecture platform, acting as a starter motor and torque fill during gear changes. Polestar states overall power output comes in at 600 hp with 1000 Nm of torque. Each electric motor produces 116 hp, while the Integrated Starter Generator produces an additional 68 hp, for a total of 300 hp, while no figure has been listed for its engine.
It is said that 0-100 km/h can take 4.2 seconds.
Batteries.
The Polestar 1 has a total capacity of 34 kWh arranged in three battery stacks (two packs). This gives the Polestar 1 an all-electric range of 150 km (NEDC). In February 2018, Polestar claimed that this was the largest electric range for any plug-in hybrid available at the time.
Power distribution.
The Polestar 1 has a plug-in hybrid powertrain, the supercharged and turbocharged high-performance petrol in-line four-cylinder petrol engine drives the front wheels. Two electric motors drive the rear wheels. In addition to these electric motors the Polestar 1 is equipped with an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG). Combined with the electric motors are planetary gear sets. These planetary gear sets enable torque vectoring, a technology used in racing to bring both acceleration and stability through curves.
Design.
Outside.
Practically all parts of the Polestar 1 upper body, including doors, bonnet and boot-lid, are made of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) for maximum stiffness, torsional rigidity and lightness. The Polestar 1 has a standard-fitted active rear spoiler delivering high-speed downforce on the rear axle. It automatically raises from its integrated flush position when the speed exceeds and is retracted when the speed is reduced below . Polestar 1 comes with a fixed panoramic glass roof, stretching all the way from the top of the windscreen to the upper edge of the rear window. The interior features handcrafted leather detailing and a carbon fibre wing that stretches to the full height of the instrument panel. The Polestar 1 also comes with a Bowers &amp; Wilkins high-end sound system. The tyre sizes are 275/30 R21 for the front and 295/30 R21 for the rear.
Inside.
The Polestar 1 has double wishbone front suspension, connecting each wheel with two transverse links. This design enables the front suspension to counteract torque steer. Most suspension parts are made of aluminium. The rear suspension is an integral link design, with a transverse composite leaf spring. Polestar 1 is the first car with Öhlins Continuously Controlled Electronic Suspension (CESi). The CESi can be set to adapt instantly to road conditions and in accordance with the driver’s chosen setting. The front brakes, are specified by Polestar and manufactured by Akebono, six piston aluminium Mono block calipers on each front wheel are milled from one-piece. The calipers are coupled with 400x38mm ventilated and drilled discs. The Polestar 1 is available in six colors: Space, Snow, Midnight, Osmium, Osmium Grey, and Magnesium, with two options for the interior: Charcoal with Zink for the seats or full Charcoal. Three options are available for the rims: Diamond Cut, Glossy Black, and Matte Black.
In popular culture.
The Polestar 1 appears on the cover of and in the 2019 racing video game "Need for Speed Heat." Not only as a playable vehicle and "hero" car, but also as part of a marketing promotion Polestar encouraged fans to design their own modifications to the Polestar 1 and post renders on Instagram with the hashtag #Polestar1xNFSHeat

Terminal Avenue

"Terminal Avenue" is a short story by Canadian author Eden Robinson. It was originally intended to be included in her 1995 short story collection "Traplines" but was omitted because, in Robinson's words, "back in the mid-90s, bondage porn didn't belong in a serious fiction collection." It was later included in "So Long Been Dreaming", an anthology of postcolonial science fiction and fantasy edited by Nalo Hopkinson and Uppinder Mehan. It was also included in "Walking the Clouds", an anthology of Indigenous science fiction edited by Gracle L. Dillon.
Background.
Eden Robinson wrote "Terminal Avenue" "in Vancouver, Canada on the number 9 Broadway bus between Commercial and the University of British Columbia" on the third anniversary of the Oka Uprising. The uprising, also known as the Oka Crisis, was a 1990 confrontation between a group of Mohawk people (along with allied Native activists) and Quebec's provincial police force over the proposed construction of a golf course on territory that, according to local Mohawk people, had been sold illegally. The conflict escalated to the point of gun battles between activists and provincial forces, resulting in one fatality (a QP corporal). According to Robinson, "It was my spec fic, bondage, aboriginal response to Oka and the Fraser River salmon wars."
Plot.
Set in what appears to be a somewhat futuristic Vancouver, the story is narrated by a Native Canadian man named Wilson Wilson (Wil). In this Canada, Indigenous people have been removed from their lands and ghettoized in urban reservations. There, they face continual brutalization by armored security officers. The armored officers are described as sexless and invulnerable, their voices mechanically distorted to conceal their identities.
The story shifts quickly between multiple timeframes. In one, the reader learns that in Wil's professional life, he is a professional submissive at an exclusive BDSM club. There, his lover (unnamed but marked as white), together with others dressed in security officer uniforms, performs sadomasochistic acts on him for an audience. In private, their roles are reversed, with Wil assuming the dominant role, but his lover maintaining the security officer's uniform.
In a past timeframe, the reader is told about Wil's father holding an illegal potlatch before being removed from the Douglas Channel area to the urban reservation. For this act, his father is later stopped along the road and beaten nearly to death by security officers. He never recovers psychologically, and commits suicide soon after. Subsequently, Wil's brother, Kevin (the only other named character in the story), participates in the Oka Uprising. After the uprising's failure, he becomes a security officer, and is disowned by his family.
The "present" timeframe is extremely condensed. A group of security officers is approaching Wil, preparing to beat him (at the story's close, presumably to his death). Wil wonders whether perhaps his brother is one of the officers assaulting him.

Jacek Proszyk

Jacek Józef Proszyk (born 7 May 1973 in Szamotuły) is a Polish historian and religions scholar. He specializes in the history of Jews and Protestants and in the general history of southern Poland and Czech Silesia.
Life.
Jacek Proszyk graduated from the University of Warsaw in 2000 with a "magister" (master of arts) degree for a thesis on "Jewish Institutions and Philanthropic Organisations in Bielsko and Biała in 1860–1939". In 2010 he was on a scholarship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In 2012 he received his "doktor" (Ph.D.) degree from the Institute of Religious Studies at Kraków's Jagiellonian University for his dissertation, "At the Crossroads of Orthodoxy, Haskalah, and Zionism: Social and Religious Transformations in the Jewish Religious Communities of Bielsko and Biała Krakowska in 1918–1939". He has taught in secondary-school and academic settings. His current post is with the History Department of the Bielsko-Biała Museum and Castle.
Work.
Since 1998 he has been cooperating with the Jewish Community in Bielsko-Biała, managing the library and the archive. The Jewish community in Bielsko-Biała covers the territory of Oświęcim (Auschwitz); this is why he participated in the recovery of the former Oświęcim Synagogue, which was later handed over to Auschwitz Jewish Center. In 2004, on behalf of the Jewish community in Bielsko-Biała, the owner of the allotment where the great synagogue in Oświęcim used to be, he managed the technical organisation of the archaeological excavation on the site of the former dismantled Jewish synagogue in Oświęcim. During the excavations, he documented all the retrieved objects. Nearly 400 kg of valuable metal Judaica from the synagogue were found on that occasion. During the excavations, an Israeli film director, Yahali Gad, shot a movie, which was presented in 2005. The movie was titled "A Treasure in Auschwitz".
In 2002 he was one of the people who rewrote the original of the Polish Brest Bible dating back to 1563, when it was reissued. In 1992–2011 he prepared more than 5000 detailed lists and photos of tombstones at Jewish cemeteries in the following locations, among others: Bielsko-Biała, Bircza, Cieszyn, Frysztak, Jasło, Kolbuszowa, Krosno, Nowy Sącz, Oświęcim, Sieniawa, Skoczów, Tyrawa Wołoska, Ulanów, Wschowa, Żywiec-Zablocie. In 2000–2010 he cooperated with the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum office in Warsaw and performed searches in the Polish State Archives. In 2007–2013 he wrote and directed more than 20 theatrical stories related to the history of Bielsko-Biała and the southern Poland for the Polish Theatre in Bielsko-Biała. The stories were very popular and well received by the local audience. It was through his initiative that numerous Jewish cemeteries in Poland were put in order, a few monuments and commemorative plaques were put up in the places where demolished synagogues used to stand and a lot of historical and genealogical research was conducted.
In 2008, he discovered the only surviving original object from the demolished the oldest synagogue of Maharshal in Lublin. It was a parochet from 1926, which is now preserved in the Jewish Community in Bielsko-Biala. In 2018 he discovered previously unknown photographs of Auschwitz concentration camp prisoners removing unexploded bombs in Czechowice. The photos were handed over to the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum.
Jacek Proszyk was supposed to have worked up Bielsko County for the 2018 study, "Dalej jest noc", but "[found it impossible to obtain] data sufficiently reliable to… perform statistical analysis and [to determine] the exact number of persons who perished, the exact number… who survived, and how they survived." Proszyk concluded that he could only "describe… verified individual cases. The war", he writes, "was a great DESTRUCTION and LIE. We do not have… complete archival records… Even what we have is not always the truth… [I]n Bielsko and Biała [which were only part of the county he was to have covered, in order to survive] Jews, Poles, and [anti-Nazi] Germans [all had to flee, lie, or pretend to be what they were not]. This falsehood left its [imprint] in the records and accounts, and that is why I [felt compelled] to verify… every account and every entry." Proszyk was unable to submit generalized findings for Bielsko County, but hopes eventually to prepare a study of particular individuals' experiences there. Proszyk's experience highlights the methodological difficulties in undertaking a reliable study of such subject matter.
Proszyk is an active editor of Wikipedia.

Majda's model is a qualitative model (in mathematical physics) introduced by Andrew Majda in 1981 for the study of interactions in the combustion theory of shock waves and explosive chemical reactions.
The following definitions are with respect to a Cartesian coordinate system with 2 variables. For functions formula_1, formula_2 of one spatial variable formula_3 representing the Lagrangian specification of the fluid flow field and the time variable formula_4, functions formula_5, formula_6 of one variable formula_7, and positive constants formula_8, the Majda model is a pair of coupled partial differential equations:

2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier

The 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier was the tournament played as part of qualification process for the 2021 ICC T20 World Cup.
Twelve regional qualifiers were held by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with 62 teams competing during 2018 in five regions – Africa (3 groups), Americas (2), Asia (2), East Asia Pacific (2) and Europe (3). The top 25 sides from these progressed to five Regional Finals in 2019, with seven teams then going on to compete in the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier, along with the six lowest ranked sides from the ICC T20I Championship.
The first sub-regional qualifier was held in Argentina with the other in the United States. The top two teams in each group advanced to the regional finals tournament, which would determine two American entrants to the 2019 ICC T20 World Cup Qualifier. In April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full international status to Twenty20 men's matches played between member sides from 1 January 2019 onwards. Therefore, all the matches in the Regional Finals will be played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is).
From the Southern sub region group, both Bermuda and the Cayman Islands qualified for the Americas Regional Finals. From the Northern sub region, Canada and United States also qualified for the Americas Regional Finals.
The Regional Finals were held in Bermuda from 18 to 25 August 2019. Following the conclusion of matches that took place on 22 August 2019, Canada and Bermuda had both progressed to the T20 World Cup Qualifier.

Monster Magic is an out-of-print collectible card game by Trio Toys. It was released in 1995. The first and only set was called "Alpha Series" and had 104 cards. The packaging for the game suggested that four more expansions may have been released which would bring the total to 520 cards, however its unlikely they were ever released.
The game was reviewed by Scrye and gameplay was described as little more than a set of playing cards. Cards had a horror motif, with glossy cards using rock star puns for the card names, such as "Axel Rhodes" that depicted a skeleton with a microphone.

1944 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1944 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 7, 1944, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background and vote.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
1944 saw the beginning of the breakdown of this single-party political system when the Supreme Court in "Smith v. Allwright" ruled against the white primary system. During the period between Smith and the 1944 election, further challenges from blacks occurred after the state announced that coming primaries would remain all-white. Despite some opposition amongst the Southern ruling elite to Roosevelt – mitigated by the replacement of Henry A. Wallace as Vice-Presidential nominee – the incumbent President again overwhelmingly carried the state, losing only 3 percent on his 1940 vote share.

Portsea (1807 ship)

Portsea (or Port Sea) was launched at Calcutta in 1807. She was a country ship; that is, she primarily traded east of the Cape of Good Hope. She participated as a transport in the British invasion of Mauritius. She then carried French prisoners of war to France. She also made one voyage to St Helena from Bengal under charter to the British East India Company (EIC). In 1814 a storm dismasted her and she was lengthened, but it is not clear whether before or after the dismasting. She made two voyages as a South Seas whaler between 1828 and 1835. In 1838 she made one voyage transporting convicts to New South Wales. She carried coal to Valparaiso in 1840 and there her owners turned her into a coal hulk. Her final fate is not known.
Career.
Invasion of Mauritius.
In 1810 "Portsea" was one of a large number of vessels that the British government chartered as transports to support the invasion.
The British government chartered some nine of these vessels, "Portsea" among them, as cartels to carry back to France the French troops that they had captured in these campaigns.
"Portsea", Hogue, Davidson, &amp; Co., owners, appeared in a list of vessels registered at Calcutta in January 1811.
East India Company voyage.
"Portsea" left Spithead with the 1st Battalion soldiers of the 60th Regiment of Foot on board that were transferred from Cowes on 30 May 1811 to the Cape of Good Hope and arrived on 18 September 1811. Her master was Captain H Roberts. She departed 15 October. 
On her way back from delivering the prisoners, "Portsea", Burgh, master, was at the Cape of Good Hope on 15 October 1811. She arrived at Kedgeree on 17 January 1812 and Calcutta on 22 January. She was at Kidderpore on 13 February and Fultah on 20 June, before returning to Kedgeree on 24 June. She then arrived at St Helena on 18 October.
Capture and recapture.
On 12 November 1812 "Portsea", sailing from Bengal, left St Helena in the company of some whalers, all bound for England. On 31 December the American privateer "Thrasher" captured her at . recaptured "Portsea" the same day. "Portsea" arrived in the Thames on 13 January 1813.
Country ship.
On 13 September 1814, "Lloyd's List" reported that "Portsea", from London to Bengal, had put into Ceylon totally dismasted. The "Register of Shipping" for 1815 shows her master as Burgh, and does not indicate that she had yet been lengthened. The need for repairs may have prompted her lengthening in 1814.
"Portsea" continued to trade in the East Indies and between India and England. "Portsea", Nichols, master, arrived at Port Jackson on 24 August 1817 with merchandise from Calcutta. She left for Peru on 7 September. A letter dated St Jago de Chili 12 December 1817, reported that "Portsea", Nichols, master, had arrived at Valparaiso from Bengal via Port Jackson with 1200 bales of piece good, valued at 300,000 dollars.
In 1824 she was sold for a Free Trader.
Whaler.
"Portsea" made two voyages as a whaler between 1828 and 1835.
First whaling voyage (1828-1831): On 5 March 1828 Captain Bews (or Bowes, or Buze) sailed for the Pacific Ocean. She was reported to have been at Atooi on 18 April 1829, at Oahu on 7 November, on the Japan grounds in April 1830, on 9 September she was in the Eastern Pacific, and at Honolulu on 29 November. She returned to England in 1831 with 322 tons of whale oil.
Second whaling voyage (1828-1831): Captain Bews sailed from England on 28 October 1831, bound for the Galápagos Islands. She was at the Galapagos in April 1832, at Honolulu on 10 November 1833, at Te Puna on 9 February 1835, and the Bay of Islands on 3 March. She returned to England on 20 August with 580 casks and 5 tanks of whale oil.
Convict voyage.
By 1837 "Portsea" had returned to trading between London and Bombay. "Lloyd's Register" for 1837 reports that she underwent small repairs in 1837, and gives the name of her master as Woodward and that of her owner as Waddell.
On 8 August 1838, "Portsea", Captain Samuel John Lowe, sailed from Plymouth with convicts, bound for New South Wales. She arrived there on 18 December. She had embarked 240 male convicts and she landed 239, one having died on the voyage.
Coal hulk.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1839 showed "Portsea" with Woodward, master, J. Somes, owner, and homeport of London.
In 1840 the newly-formed Pacific Steam Navigation Company (PSNC) purchased "Portsea" to carry coal to Valparaiso to establish a refueling depot there for its steam ships. The PSNC purchased the 485 tons of coal that "Portsea" carried from the Cwm Vale Colliery, Llanely. Captain Samuel Thomas Yetts agreed a freight of 11[[shilling|s]] per ton, for a total freight bill of [[£sd|£]]266 15s.
In October 1840 when she was off [[Cape Horn]] on her way to Chile a fire developed in her hold. The crew was able to stop the fire by throwing the burning coal overboard and putting water on the remaining coal. She then sailed on to Valparaiso.
"Portsea" discharged her remaining cargo at Valparaiso. There she provided coal for a British vessel that had just arrived, but the coal proved of poor quality, at least for steam ships. In the case of "The Pacific steam Navigation Company vs. Lewis", the PSNC argued that the coal they had received was not suitable for steam engines and the seller had stated.
After the coal was unloaded, it was discovered that several of her hold beams and stanchions were burned through, and the ceiling charred in many places. The PSNC had "Portsea"s topmasts and yards removed. She then became a coal hulk. Her final fate is currently obscure.
Appendix.
"Lloyd's List" did not carry her sale to the Pacific Steam Navigation Company or her last voyage.
"Portsea" was last listed in "Lloyd's Register" in 1844.

1940 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1940 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 5, 1940, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
Vote.
The Roosevelt/Wallace ticket easily carried the state of Georgia on election day.

Oskar Cher

Oskar Cher (2 September 1913 – 2 June 1942) was an Estonian communist activist.
Biography.
Cher was born in Reval (now Tallinn). In his youth, he was a member of the Estonian Young Socialist League. He worked as a journalist in the early 1930s, and joined the banned Communist Party of Estonia (EKP) in 1933. The same year, he was arrested and imprisoned.
Cher was released in 1935. He was arrested again in 1936, but soon released and served in the Estonian Army. After Estonia was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940, Cher organized the EKP in Läänemaa. In 1941, he was made secretary of the Young Communist League of Estonia.

Biodemography and Social Biology

Biodemography and Social Biology is a semiannual peer-reviewed academic journal covering the intersection between biology, demography, and sociology. The journal is devoted to "furthering the discussion, advancement, and dissemination of knowledge about biological and sociocultural forces interacting to affect the structure, health, well-being and behavior of human populations". The journal aims to contribute to the fields of both sociobiology and biodemography. It was established in 1916 and is published by Routledge on behalf of the Society for Biodemography and Social Biology, of which it is the official journal. The editor-in-chief is Hiroaki Matsuura (Shoin University). According to the "Journal Citation Reports", the journal has a 2019 impact factor of 1.200.
History.
"Biodemography and Social Biology" was first established in 1916 as Eugenical News. It was published under that title until 1953, during which time it was "the primary source of eugenic-related events and news in the United States". It was renamed Eugenics Quarterly in 1954, when it was launched by the American Eugenics Society as a scholarly journal focused on eugenics and related subjects. It was renamed Social Biology in 1969, as a result of the term "eugenics" falling out of fashion. It was renamed again to its current title in 2008.

Lucy Sichone

Lucy Banda-Sichone (1954–1998) was a Zambian civil rights activist who played a pivotal role in representing the Zambian people who had their rights violated by the State at the time. Born and raised in Zambia's second largest city, Kitwe, she became the first Zambian woman to receive a Rhodes Scholarship and also the first woman to have her portrait displayed on the walls of Oxford University’s prestigious Rhodes House.
After attaining a BA in Politics, Philosophy and Economics at Somerville College, Oxford, Sichone returned to Zambia where she embarked upon a career as a lawyer focused on human rights issues. She represented several displaced villagers who had been accused of squatting, and represented the people in court as pro bono clients. In 1993, Shichone formed the Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA).The aim of the association was to spread the gospel of human and democratic rights and to remind Zambians that it was not enough to have democracy on paper, but it had to be practiced. The association formed many civic education clubs within secondary schools around the country – her idea was to capture the imagination of the young whilst they could still dream. The association continues to teach citizens rights and civic education to this day.
Sichone was also very much into active politics. She joined the United National Independence Party (UNIP) shortly after it had lost to the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) in the 1991 presidential election. Although she held a number of positions in government, she was often its critic mainly because political office was never her goal. She left UNIP in 1994.
Early life.
Lucy Sichone was born on 15 May 1954. She grew up with a father who had been very strict about her education. At some point her father had served as a butler for a British colonial family where he began to take a keen interest in getting his daughters educated. Lucy managed to pursue her education from an all-girls convent secondary school. In 1978 she was accepted at the University of Zambia to study for a law degree. She obtained her degree in 1981 and won a Rhodes scholarship to study for an Philosophy and Economics degree at Oxford University in England. 
Sichone married her first husband in 1979, after their daughter turned five years old. After the death of her husband she experienced what is called "property grabbing," a practice which is still very common in Africa. It is where all household goods are taken by the late husband's relatives. The “way I was left destitute,” Lucy wrote to the Principal of Somerville College at Oxford University after winning her Rhodes Scholarship, “has given me the idea of what I want to do…start a Legal Clinic for widows and orphans.” 
Additionally, because she belonged to a patrilineal society, her children belonged according to traditional law to her husband's side of the family. But because of her legal knowledge and experience, she managed to win custody over the children. She had four children. Ten years after the death of her first husband, Shichone married her second husband.
Social activism.
Lucy Sichone represented so many clients over a wide range of issues, from government land disputes to personal issues similar to those she had experienced as a widow. The Zambia Civic Education Association (ZCEA) was formed by Shichone in 1993. This was a non-profit human rights organisation which was formed to empower the Zambian citizenry in coping with the democratic dispensation. She wanted this to assist the development of democratic process in Zambia as well as promote justice. This was to be done through increasing and creating awareness among all citizens about their duties and responsibilities under the Constitution. Sichone believed that it is in the execution of duties and responsibilities that bestow rights, privileges and equality for all before the Law.
Sichone was never content with just idling by and watching the politicians desecrate the constitution, she decided to go into politics. When everyone else was running towards the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD), the party that had just won the momentous 1991 elections that removed Kenneth Kaunda from power, Sichone decided to join the United National Independence Party (UNIP). UNIP, having ruled Zambia for 27 years, had lost the 1991 elections and its political fortunes were in decline. But for Lucy, this all didn't matter. Her calculus was probably that an association with UNIP would help spread her message about safe guarding human rights and holding politicians accountable. After all, civil society organizations at that time did not have much of a following. Everyone looked up to politicians. However, she then left the party in 1994 when she started to experience problems with fellow members of the central committee.
Sichone began contributing to the independent daily newspaper The Post in 1993. As her columns challenged the Movement for Multiparty Democracy (MMD) government and its manipulation of constitutional provisions. It was during her time at The Post that two memorable events happened that thrust her into the limelight and confirmed her position as the conscience of the nation. In February 1996, Sichone wrote an article titled “Miyanda has forgotten about need for justice”. Godfrey Miyanda was then Vice President and leader of government business in parliament. An order to arrest Sichone along with the newspaper’s managing editor and chief editor was issued. Sichone and two of her colleagues, managing editor and chief editor of the paper, were forced into hiding to avoid imprisonment on charges of contempt of Parliament after the Zambian National Assembly. After the order, there was a lot of international pressure from human rights groups, journalists and legal groups to absolve her because she had a three-month-old baby at that time.
The other two surrendered to authorities, but Sichone did not and remained hiding. While at large, she continued to write columns for The Post, and declared not submit to National Assembly Speaker Robinson Nabulyato’s unconstitutional decree. She wrote, “The freedoms enshrined in the Bill of Rights make it a sacred duty for me to defend them to the death.” She ended up becoming the first Zambian to win the International Women Media Foundation Courage in Journalism Award in 1996 for the same article for which they were trying to arrest her for. She eventually gave herself up and a sort of truce existed between her and the authorities.
Death and legacy.
Lucy Sichone died at the age of 44 at the University Teaching Hospital (UTH) in Lusaka, on August 24, 1998. The Post, where she used to work as a columnist, published a front page memorial article for her, with the headline “Zambia mourns Sichone”. A series of articles ran in The Post after her death, showing the condolences from many political leaders, non-governmental organizations and citizens from the nation. Editor-in-chief of The Post, Fred M'membe, who was also a close personal friend to the late human rights activist, said Zambia had lost one of its daughters.
Sichone's death was widely mourned. The civil society movement tried to petition the government to accord her a state funeral but, as expected, the authorities declined. We are all left to wonder what other brave and inspiring things she would have done had she lived longer. Grieve Chelwa, author of the article "Lucy Sichone: Conscience of the Zambian nation," wrote in 2015, "I had the rare privilege of meeting Lucy Sichone in 1998, the year she died, during a prize giving ceremony for students who had done a lot to advance civic education at their schools. She gave me a certificate carrying her immortal signature and asked all the recipients that day to carry her dream even further."
In 2015, Lucy’s friend and attorney Dr. Ann Olivarius, who established The Rhodes Project to study Rhodes Scholars, commissioned a portrait of Lucy to hang in Rhodes House, the Oxford home of the scholarship. The Rhodes Project also published a recollection of Lucy by her daughter, Martha Sichone Cameron.

Honey (Scandal album)

Honey is the eighth studio album by Japanese rock band Scandal. The album was released on February 14, 2018 by Epic Records Japan. It features a total of ten songs, including the 2016 single "Take Me Out". "Honey" reached number 3 on both the Oricon and "Billboard Japan" charts. The album was released on March 2, 2018 in Europe and North America by JPU Records.
Background.
According to lead guitarist Mami, Scandal chose "Honey" as the title because they felt it best described "“sweet” and “sharp” like a thorn and even “poisonous” all together." The album's artwork and lyrics also reflect this feeling as well. The artwork was done in collaboration with the band's friends Amiaya.
Like their previous album, 2016's "Yellow", the members of Scandal wrote and composed all the songs on "Honey" themselves. However, unlike all their prior material where guitarists Mami and Haruna played mainly the same chords, for "Honey" they specifically kept them separate. Haruna played the foundation of power chords and low notes, while Mami stuck to single notes. With ten songs total, it is the band's shortest album of their career; they wanted to record only their strongest songs and feel that all ten fit together as a single story. Because lead vocalist Haruna did not write any of the lyrics, she said she was able to fully immerse herself as each song's protagonist and use different voices on each song.
Themes.
"Take Me Out" was released as the band's 10th anniversary single in July 2016. Mami said it was a rock song made specifically to play live.
"Koisuru Universe" was released as Scandal's first digital-only single in October 2017. Digital distribution was done as opposed to a physical release so that the title track could be heard before their joint tour that same month with the bands Unison Square Garden, 04 Limited Sazabys and Blue Encount. The song was created during their earlier 47 Prefecture Tour which was held from March to July 2017. The lyrics to the single's b-side, "Futari", were first drafted in summer 2016, while its music was completed at the beginning of 2017. Mami composed it under the influence of instrumental bands and to have a melody as if a guitar was singing. Both songs were intended to sound good live.
Mami said that the band wanted "Platform Syndrome" to be "the face of the album" and described it as a very energetic rock song. She also explained that with a theme of "love songs from the woman's perspective", they imagined it and "Over" as connecting together. "Over" is a heavy rock track born from wanting a song that begins with guitar that "cuts through the air." These were the last two songs recorded, made just one week from their deadline. Each was made in a single day.
Mami called "Oh! No!" a "nonsensical song" that was written during their previous album, "Yellow". She revealed that writing and composing it was easy and natural as she just included "whatever was on my mind at that time."
For the "urban dance" number "Midnight City", drummer Rina sings the verses while Haruna sings the chorus. Bassist Tomomi said she played funky phrases instead of octaves for the "disco-like" song.
For "Short Short", Rina was inspired by television and books and wrote the lyrics as a short-lived love story. Its title is supposed to suggest it is even shorter than a short story. Mami felt that it is the most emotional song on the album. She said that it is very simple sound-wise and therefore added voices to have "color". However, Haruna cited it as the most challenging song on the album for her, as she pushed herself to sing more gently than usual. It was actually made about two years prior and uses her vocal take from that time, although some parts were re-recorded.
Tomomi wrote "Mado wo Aketara" in 2015 with no plans to release it. She said that at the time "I felt like my soul sort of drifted out of me. I made this song in hopes of holding on to that feeling that I felt at that moment." While making "Honey" everyone kept telling her to include it, which she admits turned out to be great timing. Because of its personal nature, she asked her friend Mizuki Masuda from Negoto to arrange it.
Mami composed "Electric Girl", which she joked was a "weird dance" song, while playing around with her instruments. Its lyrics, which begin with onomatopoeia, came to Rina suddenly while taking a taxi home from the studio. The song has some auto-tuned vocals and a bass solo.
Release.
"Honey" was released in Japan on February 14, 2018. In addition to a regular edition, a first press limited edition of the album includes a DVD of their 11th anniversary concert, "Storytellers: Scandal". Which marked the first time a Japanese band took part in the "Storytellers" television show. A different limited edition comes with a T-shirt designed by Amiaya. All three have different cover art.
The European edition of the album includes lyric translations. A limited edition including a T-shirt and guitar pick was limited to 200 copies.
To celebrate the album's release, Scandal held a free concert at Zepp DiverCity on the day of "Honey"s Japanese release for people who preordered it. The national Honey tour began on March 3 and concluded on May 25. The Asian leg took place in June with shows in Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangzhou, Manila and Taipei. A six-date North American tour took place in September 2018.
Reception.
In a review for JaME U.S.A., Chris N. wrote that with "Honey" Scandal returned to their garage rock roots but with "an emotional maturity and a technical sophistication" to their songwriting. He suggested that the only problem with the album might be that it is too short.
Chart performance.
"Honey" reached number three on the weekly Oricon chart and charted for 11 weeks. It also reached number three on "Billboard Japan"s Hot Albums chart. It reached number two on "Billboard Japan"s Top Albums Sales chart, which is based only on album sales. The album also topped nine charts across Europe, and reached the top 10 in three more.

William Smethergell

William Smethergell (6 January 1751 - before March 1836) was an English composer and musician who lived and worked in London. Christened in the church of St Peter le Poer, after an apprenticeship of seven years, Smethergell became the organist of two London churches, All Hallows-by-the-Tower and St Mary-at-Hill, posts which he held simultaneously for fifty years. He was also the principal viola player at the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens.
His surviving works include two published sets of symphonies, six harpsichord sonatas, seven keyboard concertos and a number of works for smaller forces. Timothy Rishton, writing about his life in 1983, notes that the early promise of his keyboard works, some of the first to be specified for pianoforte, is not fulfilled, and for the last thirty years of his life he wrote little (at least which survives).

<doc id="56696217" url="?curid=56696217" title="Toad-Grayling Formation">
Toad-Grayling Formation

Toad Formation, Grayling Formation, and Toad-Grayling Formation are obsolete names for the strata of the Early to Middle Triassic Doig and Montney Formations. They were applied in the foothills and Rocky Mountains of northeastern British Columbia, on the western edge of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin. Although the names are considered obsolete, their usage persists.
The Toad and Grayling strata have yielded fossils of marine organisms, including ammonites, brachiopods, and bivalves.
Stratigraphic history.
The Toad and Grayling Formations were originally described by E.D. Kindle in 1944, who named them for the Toad and Grayling Rivers, which are tributaries of the Liard River in northeasternmost British Columbia. They were combined as the Toad-Grayling Formation by A.D. Hunt and J.D. Ratcliffe in 1959. The Toad-Grayling was replaced by the Doig and Montney Formations by J.H. Armitage in 1962, and the names are now considered obsolete, although their usage persists.
Lithology.
The Grayling Formation consists of dolomitic siltstone and silty shale, with minor silty limestone, dolomite, and very fine-grained sandstone. It reaches a maximum thickness of about 460 metres (1500 ft). The overlying Toad Formation is more calcareous and less dolomitic than the Grayling. It consists of dark grey calcareous siltstone and silty limestone, with minor amounts of silty dolomite and calcareous sandstone and, in the lower part, minor thin, randomly dispersed lenses and nodules of phosphate. It reaches a maximum thickness of about 825 metres (2700 ft).
Relationship to other units.
The Grayling Formation unconformably overlies the Permian Fantasque Formation. It is equivalent to the lower Montney Formation in the subsurface of the Peace River plains and to the Phroso Siltstone Member of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in west-central and southwestern Alberta. Its contact with the overlying Toad Formation is gradational.
The Toad Formation is conformably overlain by the Liard Formation. North of the Peace River it is overlain, possibly unconformably, by the Ludington Formation, and in the Liard River area it is unconformably overlain by the Fort St. John Group. It is laterally equivalent to the Doig Formation and the upper two-thirds of the Montney Formation in the subsurface of the Peace River plains, and to part of the Llama Member of the Sulphur Mountain Formation in west-central and southwestern Alberta.

Brenda Ann Kenneally

Brenda Ann Kenneally (born 1959) is an American photojournalist and documentary photographer, specializing in social causes and the illegal drug economy. Her work has been featured in the NYT Magazine, Rolling Stone, and Ms. She won the 2000 Community Awareness Award from the National Press Photographer's Association, and the 2001 International Prize for Photojournalism. She is a Guggenheim Fellow, Pulitzer Prize nominee, and formerly incarcerated and homeless youth. Kenneally is the founder of A Little Creative Class, a non-profit art organization that works to address the obstacles that deter poor and low-income youth from participation in art and the emerging idea-based economy.
Early life.
Kenneally was born in Albany, New York in the late 1950s, and grew up nearby Troy, New York. Her parents divorced eight years into their marriage. She then moved back in with her mother, and Kenneally's grandmother. Kenneally's grandmother sought out to keep Kenneally from making the same mistakes as her mother, barring her from friends whom her grandmother deemed as bad influences. At the age of twelve, she was declared "incorrigible" by the Albany County Family Court and declared a ward of the New York State Division for Youth. She began living in group homes and temporary shelters where she became acquainted with the people her grandmother had once forbidden. Kenneally's cynicism of the system, which influence her later works, was learned in these homes, where experiences with abuses preceded criminal behavior. 
She left the city at the age of 17. She fled to Florida and worked intermittently as a snake charmer in the carnival and as an assistant to photographers Rosalind Solomon and Eugene Richards. She attended the University of Miami after getting sober, studying both photojournalism and sociology. She was introduced by her journalism professor at Miami to Tom Schroeder, the editor of "Tropic," the M"iami Herald" Sunday magazine, which subsequently led to the publishing of her photographs of South Beach, Miami.
After graduating from the University of Miami, Kenneally moved to Bushwick, Brooklyn in 1996 to receive a masters in Photography from N.Y.U graduate school. She began photographing her neighbors’ struggles with poverty and drugs. Her photographs from that time are "an investigation into the effects of various social and political policies."
Career.
Kenneally began her career in Florida, photographing the economic and racial divisions. She took photos over a seven-year period before moving back to New York. She moved to Brooklyn and started photographing people's struggles with drugs and poverty. It was her work in New York that gained her national attention for photography.
In 2003, Kenneally began a project she called Upstate Girls. The project was sparked by a teenager named Kayla who approached Kenneally and asked if she wanted to film the birth of her child. She spent the next 14 years photographing Kayla, including taking pictures of her children, family, and friends. Images from the project were posted by Slate in 2014. The images caused a backlash on social media with some people criticizing both Kenneally and Kayla, while others defended them.
She is also a recipient of the W. Eugene Smith Grant in Humanistic Photography which was awarded to her in 2001.

Widow chastity

Widow chastity was an ideal in traditional Chinese cultural practices and beliefs that honored widowed women and discouraged their remarriage, encouraging them instead to live a life of "virtuous chastity". The idea of widow chastity has a long history in China, but the emphasis on the practice is believed to have its origin among Song dynasty Neo-Confucians, and reached a culmination and eventual end in the Qing era.
History.
Early periods.
The idea of widow chastity may be found as early as the Zhou dynasty "Book of Rites". During the Han dynasty, Ban Zhao wrote: "According to ritual, husbands have a duty to marry again, but there is no text that authorizes a woman to remarry." Liu Xiang also wrote about widow chastity in his work "Biographies of Exemplary Women". Widow chastity gained prominence in the later Han dynasty, and chaste widows were rewarded. During the Tang dynasty, widows may be protected from forcible remarriage that would see them losing rights to their deceased husbands' property.
Song dynasty.
During the Song dynasty, Confucianism became the dominant belief system, and neo-Confucians such as Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi placed strong emphasis on chastity; Cheng Yi is believed to be responsible for the rise of the cult of widow chastity. Cheng Yi thought it improper for a man to marry a widow because "a marriage is a match and if one takes someone who has already lost her integrity, he would also lose his". On the question of widows who had become impoverished due to the death of their husbands, Cheng stated: "To starve to death is a small matter, but to lose one's chastity is a great matter." 
During the Song dynasty, it was common for women to keep their own dowries including properties they had inherited from their fathers, and after the death of their husbands, they may return to the family of their birth along with such properties as well as any wealth they had accumulated during their marriage. Song dynasty widows who returned to their original family enjoyed the protection of the laws on property rights, which made their remarriage easier. The neo-Confucians challenged such laws, arguing that these widows should stay with their husbands' families to support them. While it was normal for widows to remarry in the early Song period, remarriage became a social stigma in later eras due to the influence of Confucians; this led to hardship and loneliness for many widows. The Song poetess Li Qingzhao, after her first husband Zhao Mingcheng died, remarried briefly when she was aged 49, for which she was strongly criticised.
Yuan dynasty.
During the Yuan dynasty, laws promoting widow chastity were first enacted in part under the influence of Song dynasty Confucians who argued against remarriage of widows. Such laws forbade women from taking their own properties back to the families of their birth, or to another family should they remarry. In so doing, a woman's property became the property of her first husband's family, which affected a woman's worth and her prospect of remarriage.
Ming dynasty.
During the Ming dynasty, widow chastity became increasingly common, gained wide prominence and was given legal support. Marriage and property laws that discouraged remarriage started during the Yuan dynasty also made widow chastity increasingly popular. Chaste widows were elevated to the role of cultural heroes, and the state awarded 'testimonials of merit' (旌表, "jingbiao") to chaste women. Such awards had been given to chaste widows (節婦) since the early 14th century, and extended to women who died resisting rape (烈女) in the late 16th century. The state gave approval to local chastity cults whereby commemorative arches (貞節坊) and shrines were constructed to honor the women by members of their families or communities, and honored them with commemorative writings. Chastity also became associated with suicide, and suicide by widows increased dramatically during the Ming era.
Qing dynasty.
During the Qing period, the prevalence of child marriage along with a high rate of premature death among men left a substantial number of young women as widows. Typically, a widowed woman would have been taken into her husband's familial household before his death and as a result would be unable to fulfill her intended purpose; giving birth to a male child to continue the husband's blood line. However, due to Qing-era China's higher proportion of men (mostly due to female infanticide) a fertile woman, despite her previous marriage, could be sold and wed to another family for a substantial price.
The Qing court disapproved of this practice, and instead regarded widow chastity as the epitome of filial piety and also as a statement of loyalty to the imperial court and government officials. To promote this viewpoint the Qing court arranged to confer honors upon a family housing a chaste widow, along with other measures such as the construction of a large and ornate ceremonial arch—"Chastity Paifang" or "Chastity and Filial Paifang" (節孝牌坊)—in the family's community. Widows were also encouraged to adhere to chastity by legal measures: according to Qing era law, a widow could only inherit or act as a custodian of her husband's property if she preserved her sexuality as a statement of "loyalty" to her late husband. In culturally dissident regions of the Chinese empire, government officials started "Widow Chastity" crusades to enforce orthodox Chinese culture and eliminate unconventional marriage customs, particularly the levirate marriage, a practice in which a man marries his dead brother's widow in order to continue his blood line.
Decline.
The "widow chastity" agenda began to attract controversy from the Qing court when elite families in central regions of China started using the imperial commendation of widow chastity to gain an edge in social competition within their communities. Authorities were particularly concerned with dubious cases in which honors had been given to families where the widow had committed suicide following her husband's death. Despite suicide being regarded as an honorable and virtuous course of action for a widow to take, the circumstances surrounding these suicides were often very suspicious and suggested foul play on the part of the husband's family. Eventually this issue led the imperial court to promote "Widow Chastity" with much less zeal and to offer honors with more careful discretion. New cultural and intellectual developments in Qing China, in particular the "Evidential Research Movement" (Kaozheng), also began to open up new conversations on the fundamental morality of "Widow Chastity". Skeptics of the neo-Confucian status quo of the time, notably Wang Zhong, condemned "Widow Chastity" as a collection of outdated rituals lacking in logic and basic human compassion.

Fonteius Capito (consul 67)

Fonteius Capito was a Roman senator, who was active during the reign of Nero. He was consul for the year 67 as the colleague of Lucius Julius Rufus.
Capito came from a plebeian family whose members had reached the rank of praetor since the 2nd century BC, but none had achieved the consulate until the end of the Republic, in 33 BC, when Gaius Fonteius Capito did so. According to Cicero, the Fonteii came from Tusculum. Capito was probably the son or grandson of the eponymous consul of the year 12; his brother Gaius Fonteius Capito was one of the consuls of the year 59.
Capito's only known office was as governor of the imperial province of Germania Inferior. He assisted in the suppression of the revolt of Vindex, as well as having the Batavian king Julius Paullus Civilis executed and his brother Julius Civilis arrested and sent to Rome. Soon after Nero took his life and Galba became emperor, Capito was executed by the orders of the legionary commanders Cornelius Aquinus and Fabius Valens, allegedly because he was plotting against Galba. Tacitus records some believed that although Capito was "foully stained with avarice and profligacy", he was otherwise loyal to Galba and instead Aquinus and Valens were the ones intriguing against Galba; to hide their treason they accused Capito, who, once dead, could not respond to these accusations. The troops believed that a third commander, Julius Burdo, commander of the Rhine Fleet, was also responsible for Capito's death; he was held in prison to save his life.

Loiyangalani–Suswa High Voltage Power Line

Loiyangalani–Suswa High Voltage Power Line is a high voltage electricity power line in Kenya, connecting the high voltage substation at Loyangalani, in Marsabit County, to another high voltage substation at Suswa, in Narok County.
Location.
The power line starts at the Lake Turkana Wind Power Station in Loiyangalani, Marsabit County and runs in a southerly direction for approximately to end at the Kenya Electricity Transmission Company electricity substation, at Suswa, in Narok County.
Overview.
The 400kV power line is intended to evacuate the electricity generated at the Turkana Wind Power Station, to the Ketraco substation at Suswa. The Government of Spain is lending the Kenyan government a total of €142 million (approx. US$174.6 million), to have this line constructed. The contract between Isolux and Ketraco is for a construction price of US$208.1 million. The government of Kenya will provide the balance of approximately US$33.5 million as equity in the power line, along with any associated land acquisition costs.
Construction.
In 2011, the Spanish company, Isolux Ingeniera SA won the contract to construct this power line. Due to a prolonged land acquisition process, work did not actually start until November 2015. Sixteen months into construction, on a project allocated 24 months, the parent company of the main contractor, Isolux Corsán, ran out of money and filed bankruptcy in Spain due to the 2008–2014 Spanish financial crisis. In August 2017, Ketraco terminated the contract with Isolux, with about 30 percent of the work completed.
In February 2018, the Kenya government, through Ketraco, contracted a consortium of Chinese firms at a cost of US$96 million, to complete the work left pending by Isolux. Work is expected to conclude in August 2018. The consortium, comprising "NARI Group Corporation" and "Power China Guizhou Engineering Company", has committed in writing to pay US$10 million in fines, for every month the work goes beyond the 31 August 2018 deadline.
In September 2018, Reuters reported that construction of the power station was complete and it was awaiting testing and commissioning, requiring the power line to be energized from grid to gradually configure the hundreds of turbines.
In July 2019, Uhuru Kenyatta, the president of Kenya officially commissioned the completed high voltage line (including a fiber optic line), as well as the wind power station that it serves (Lake Turkana Wind Power Station).
Capacity charge.
In January 2017, the owners of Lake Turkana Wind Power Station started to bill the Kenya Power Company a monthly "capacity charge" of KSh700 million (approx. US$7 million), for power produced by the power station that cannot be evacuated due to the lack of a high-voltage line to transmit it to the substation at Suswa. Following negotiations, in September 2017, the government of Kenya agreed to pay the developers of Lake Turkana Wind Power Station, a total of Sh5.7 billion (approx. US$55.83 million), in monthly installments, spread over a six-year period. The monthly payment will amount to Sh78,600,000 (approx. US$769,833). The monthly surcharge will be passed on to the consumers, beginning in May 2018.

Never Say Die (Chvrches song)

"Never Say Die" is a song recorded by Scottish synthpop band Chvrches. Written by the band and its producer Greg Kurstin, it was released by Glassnote Records on 29 March 2018, as the third single from the band's third studio album, "Love Is Dead" (2018). The song is also featured in the soundtrack of the 2018 video game "Forza Horizon 4".
Composition.
"Never Say Die" is a downtempo electro song that "features robust, linear-patterned synths that maintain the song's energy". Despite the band's well-known "airy synths", there is "a more abrasive-sounding synth leads the charge during the bridge leading into the anthemic chorus", according to Derrick Rossignol of "Uproxx". In a statement, Lauren Mayberry said that it is "one of my favorite songs on the record because it really leans into the juxtaposition of what we do—the mixture between the dark and the light", describing it as "melodic and direct but uses some of the gnarliest sounds we've ever tried". "The chorus lyric came about very quickly but the verses took a lot longer. I really wanted to sum up a feeling of trying to be optimistic when you feel disillusioned by the people around you, but trying to keep going because 'Goonies Never Say Die.'"
Critical reception.
Tom Breihan of "Stereogum" wrote that the song leans towards "almost-EDM synth sounds", calling it "a clear attempt to swing at crossover stardom while still keeping the group's personality intact". Similarly, Winston Cook-Wilson of "Spin" opined that it features "a slinking R&amp;B feel and a complementary, stuttering vocal cadence from Lauren Mayberry" while "retaining the band's typical arena-ready dynamics". Hayden Wright of CBS Radio deemed the song "an intense electro track with Lauren Mayberry's signature pop-friendly vocals". Robin Murray of "Clash" regarded the song as "a dazzling return" and "a deft fusion of light and shade", driven by Mayberry's powerful vocal and Kurstin's seismic production.

Frederic James de Peyster

Frederic James de Peyster (February 5, 1839 – May 10, 1905) was a prominent American soldier, lawyer, and member of New York Society during the Gilded Age.
Early life.
Frederic James de Peyster was born on February 5, 1839 in New York City. He was the first of five children born to James Ferguson de Peyster (1794–1874) and his second wife, Frances Goodhue (née Ashton) de Peyster (1805–1871). His father was a widower of Susan Maria Clarkson, with whom he had one child, Susan Maria de Peyster (1823–1910), who married Robert Edward Livingston (1820–1889) of Clermont. Through his half-sister Susan, he was the uncle of Goodhue Livingston, the prominent New York architect. Frederic was the only child from his parents marriage to marry and have children.
His maternal grandfather was William Ashton. His paternal grandparents were Helen Livingston Hake and Frederic de Peyster who fought for the British crown during the American Revolution and was descended from Arent Schuyler and Abraham de Peyster (the 20th Mayor of New York City). His uncle was Frederic de Peyster.
De Peyster prepared for college at the private school of Dr. Dennis. He graduated from College of the City of New York in 1860 with an A.B. degree and later an A.M. degree. He studied law at Columbia Law School, graduating in 1862 with an LL.B. degree, and in 1864 with an LL.M. degree.
Career.
After being admitted to the bar, de Peyster practiced law in New York for many years. He was associated with the firm Tremaine &amp; Tyler. From his father, he inherited a significant fortune, enabling him to avoid being "tied down to his professional duties, and much of his time has been spent in the interests of charity."
De Peyster, who was "deeply interested in historic and patriotic subjects," served as president of the Holland Society, governor of the Society of Colonial Wars, president of the New York Dispensary and chairman of the New York Society Library. He was also involved with the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, serving for several years as the New York trustee and treasurer. He served as treasurer of The Bank for Savings in the City of New-York.
Society life.
In 1892, both de Peyster and his wife Augusta were included in Ward McAllister's "Four Hundred", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in "The New York Times". Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. De Peyster was a member of the Saint Nicholas Society, serving as president. During his time as president, he was awarded the Order of Orange-Nassau by Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands.
Personal life.
On October 10, 1871, Frederic was married to Augusta McEvers Morris (1851–1911), a daughter of William Henry Morris (1810–1896) and his second wife, Ella (née Birckhead) Morris. Her half-brother was Augustus Newbold Morris. Together, they had a home at 11 East 86th Street in Manhattan and were the parents of:
De Peyster died in Lakewood, New Jersey, where the family vacationed, on May 11, 1905. He was buried in his family's vault in Trinity Church Cemetery. His entire estate was left to his widow and five children with his widow receiving 3/8ths and each child receiving 1/8th.
Descendants.
Through his eldest daughter Helen, he was the grandfather of George Livingston de Peyster (b. 1909), who married Shirley Tucker Hull (1918–2014) in 1942. Through his son Frederic Ashton, he was the grandfather of Alice Townsend de Peyster (b. 1910), who married James Todd Jr.; Frederic Ashton de Peyster Jr. (b. 1911); and Helen Van Courtlandt de Peyster (b. 1913), who married Erica A. von Raits; James Abercrombie de Peyster, who married Dorothy Shelby Sims, the daughter of Princess Irbain-Khan Kaplanoff.

Miracle (Chvrches song)

"Miracle" is a song recorded by Scottish synthpop band Chvrches. Written and produced by the band and Steve Mac, it was released by Glassnote Records on 10 April 2018, as the fourth single from the band's third studio album, "Love Is Dead" (2018).
Background.
The song premiered as Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1, where the band revealed that it is the only song from the album recorded in the United Kingdom. "'Miracle' is the only song from "Love Is Dead" that we didn't write and record in the States, instead producing it in London with Steve Mac. Steve is such an intuitive writer with such a killer ear for melody and working with him felt very easy and natural. He makes space for everyone in the room and really pushes people to try things and go outside of their comfort zone, in a good way," said Mayberry.
Composition.
"Miracle" is a pop song consisting of elements from '90s rock music. According to "Rolling Stone"s Jon Blistein, the song features "booming percussion cut with laser-like synths" and "an Imagine Dragons-esque drop", with "the production moving between sparse, airy verses and a speaker-rattling chorus". The chorus has also been described as "a faux-EDM breakdown", and it contains a lot of "woahs".
Critical reception.
Lauren O'Neill of "Vice" praised the song's drop which was "blended with enough unexpected elements that it doesn't feel generic", noting the influence of bands like The Cardigans and Garbage. Peter Helman of "Stereogum" did not notice a huge difference in terms of production despite not being produced by Greg Kurstin, who produced most songs from the album, calling it "another big pop song, with a 'woah' chant and everything".
Music video.
A music video was released for the song on 25 April 2018. It was directed by Warren Fu and shot in one take. In it, Mayberry calmly strolls through a foggy, post-apocalyptic setting in slow motion, as she sings the song. She navigates turbulent streets filled with riots, fist fights, and explosions, before reaching a climax in which a glowing blue heart explodes and Mayberry is splattered with blue paint. Mayberry said of the video in a press release: "We're all huge fans of Warren's work and were so excited when he agreed to be the creative director on this. We met him when he directed the video for our song 'Clearest Blue' and it's so cool to see the world you imagined come to life through his work." Michael Love Michael of "Paper" called it "an extended metaphor for today's times: exploring what it means to look truth in the eye — which can often be chaotic, unpredictable, and uncertain — with a steely, focused gaze, like the buddha watching their thoughts float by in the river, without judgment or fear".

1936 United States presidential election in Georgia

The 1936 United States presidential election in Georgia took place on November 3, 1936, as part of the wider United States Presidential election. Voters chose 12 representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
With the exception of a handful of historically Unionist North Georgia counties – chiefly Fannin but also to a lesser extent Pickens, Gilmer and Towns – Georgia since the 1880s had been a one-party state dominated by the Democratic Party. Disfranchisement of almost all African-Americans and most poor whites had made the Republican Party virtually nonexistent outside of local governments in those few hill counties, and the national Democratic Party served as the guardian of white supremacy against a Republican Party historically associated with memories of Reconstruction. The only competitive elections were Democratic primaries, which state laws restricted to whites on the grounds of the Democratic Party being legally a private club.
Vote.
The Roosevelt/Garner ticket easily carried the state of Georgia on election day.

Asterina stellifera

Asterina stellifera is one of thirty species of small bat star in the genus "Asterina". It is mainly found on the east coast of South America, ranging from Cabo Frio, Brazil to Mar del Plata, Argentina. In the past decades, their numbers have depleted and are currently abundant only in the southern limit of its former range. Due to this decline, it is on Brazil’s endangered species list. It has a slow growth rate and relatively long lifespan. "A. stellifera" is an omnivorous generalist predator, and modifies the abundance of other invertebrates and algae in subtidal marine communities.
Anatomy.
This type of sea star grows five arms and can reach up to in length, though most stay around . The size is found to vary with depth, larger sea stars are found deeper while smaller ones are usually found in shallow waters. The can be found in a variety of colors, mainly white and brownish, but also can be an orange-red color. 
All sea stars have tube feet that are controlled by hydraulic pressure. They can be found arranged in grooves along the arms. Tube feet are used to move around, they can attach to all different surfaces, feeding by passing food along the arms and to the mouth which is located at the center of the organism and for respiration. Sea stars do not have gills or lungs for respiration, they rely on their tube feet and papules, or skin gills, to take oxygen out of the surrounding water and move it into their bodies.
Reproduction.
"Asterina stellifera" has a defined annual and synchronous reproductive cycle. This cycle is affected by seawater temperature and day-length, they increase chances of fertilization by controlling gametogenesis (a process in which one cell splits to form four more cells). Reproduction is also regulated by planktonic food supply. "A. stellifera" can reproduce asexually by breaking apart into smaller parts and regrowing the missing limb. This explains why "Asterina" can be found living with less than five arms. Asterian sea stars also reproduce through dispersal of eggs. At the beginning of reproduction, many starfish belonging to the asteroid species form aggregations, nothing has been researched for "A. stellifera" but it can be assumed they would also mate like this. It is known that other "Asterina" species deposit up to 1000 eggs in a specific location in the process of reproduction. They mainly deposit underneath large rocks or corals. Scientists have also found that several males will surround one female during reproduction. From this, we can infer that "A. stellifera" would do this, but it has not yet been researched fully.
Ecology.
"Asterina stellifera" feeds on macroalgae, bryozoans, tunicates, polyps, and biofilm as well as different types of kelp.
"Asterina stellifera" is one of the few asteroid species found in the rocky coast of the South Atlantic Ocean. They stay in the coastal zones near rocky outcroppings and most can be found around down.
The accelerating development of Mar del Plata shoreline for industry, agriculture, and tourism during the last decade is degrading coastal ecosystems by habitat disturbance and pollution. On top of that, the recent arrival of two invasive species into the sea stars last remaining habitat, the kelp "Undaria pinnatifida" and the sea slug "Pleurobranchaea maculata" add potential threats. The kelp competes for space, not only the space of "A. stellifera" but also that of its prey. "P. maculata" has a large overlap of prey with "A. stellifera", decreasing the amount available for the sea star.
Research.
A study was performed to model individual growth and explore the relationship of changes in local abundance with variation in environmental factors and the reproductive status of individuals. They studied the relationship between male and female organ wet weights with seawater temperature, salinity, monthly mean precipitation, and day-length. It was found that seawater temperature and day-length appear to influence the rapid increase of gonads and it was also found that gamete release failure is not the cause of the scarcity of new sea stars.
"Asterina stellifera" was also used to explore the structure of the mucous granules in the tube feet of sea stars. It was found that "A. stellifera" mucous granules had a rounded profile, which is an indication that they have an ellipsoidal shape in three dimensions. They were also organized in a regular hexagonal array, indicating that there could be some kind of binding material giving the bundle the shape of a hexagonal rod. This was different than what had been previously discovered, electron microscopic studies of various tissues containing mucus-secreting cells all showed a lack of an organized structure.

Whitecap Resources

Whitecap Resources is a Canadian public oil company based in Calgary, Alberta, with operations in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia. In 2018, it produced 74,415 barrels of energy per day, with 85% of production consisting of crude oil and other liquids. It is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
History.
Whitecap Resources was founded in 2009. Its daily production grew rapidly in the following years, from 275 barrels of energy per day in 2009 to 14,052 in 2012. In 2012, it acquired Midway Energy, another Alberta light oil producer, for $550 million. In 2016, Whitecap bought some of Husky Energy's oil assets in Southwest Saskatchewan for $595 million. 
In 2017, Brad Wall, then-premier of Saskatchewan, invited Whitecap to move to that province, citing lower taxes and subsidized relocation costs. The company CEO, Grant Fagerheim, said that it was considering the offer, but would only move if it benefited shareholders.
In November 2017, Whitecap purchased a 62% interest in the Weyburn oil project in Saskatchewan for $940 million from Cenovus Energy. The deal was expected to increase Whitecap's oil production by 25%.
Operations.
Whitecap Resources primarily produces light, sweet crude oil, as opposed to heavy oil or natural gas. It generally focuses on oil development and production instead of exploration. It has properties in northwest Alberta &amp; B.C., central Alberta, and Saskatchewan with 2019 production guidance of 70,000 - 72,000 barrels of energy per day. As of 2019, Whitecap has identified 2,827 gross drilling locations (8 to 10 years of inventory) with 1,568 proved plus probable.
Whitecap's strategy is to deliver 10% to 15%/annum dividend + growth through balance sheet strength, sustainable dividends and moderate growth.
Carbon sequestration.
Whitecap's Weyburn-Midale Carbon Dioxide Project, transports emissions from a North Dakota coal power plant and a coal gasification facility to the Weyburn oilfields located south of Regina oilfield in region south of Regina, Saskatchewan. According to a January 25, 2021 "CBC News" article, the Whitecap project is very similar but much larger than the Enhance Energy project that is part of the Alberta Carbon Trunk Line System.
In November 2017, Whitecap purchased a 62% interest in the Weyburn oil project in Saskatchewan for $940 million from Cenovus Energy. The deal was expected to increase Whitecap's oil production by 25%.
According to a 2008 article in "Canadian Geographic Magazine", at that time the Weyburn carbon monitoring and storage project was the world's largest carbon capture and storage project.

Microtis rara

Microtis rara, commonly known as the scented onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Australia, with the exception of the Northern Territory. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small green or yellowish-green, scented flowers. It is similar to "Microtis oblonga" and some authorities regard the two as being one species.
Description.
"Microtis rara" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, tapering, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty green or greenish-yellow flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers sweetly scented, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide with a dished lower surface. The lateral sepals are linear to oblong, long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are a curved lance shape, long, about wide and spread widely apart. The labellum is more or less oblong, long, wide with notched edges and a narrowed middle section. There are dark green calli in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January and is stimulated by fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis rara" was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in "Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen". The specific epithet ("rara") is a Latin word meaning "scarce", "scattered" or "dispersed".
Some authorities regard "Microtis oblonga" as being a race of "M. rara".
Distribution and habitat.
The scented onion orchid grows swamps and wet forests and is widespread but not common, occurring in all states but not the Northern Territory.

Percy Hanley

Percy Hanley (29 May 1905 – 18 September 1973) was a British trade unionist.
Hanley joined the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU) in 1924, and became increasingly prominent in the union. Based in Peterborough, he worked as the union's part-time district secretary. During this period, he was a delegate to its national conference on five occasions, serving on its standing orders committee for five of these.
In 1950, Hanley began working full-time for the union, as divisional organiser of its number 12 district. Six years later, he narrowly defeated Edwin Boyce to become executive councillor for division number 5, which covered Sheffield and the East Midlands. He held this seat in 1964, when he beat Boyce by an even smaller margin, being seen as the more right-wing of the two candidates. During this period, he served as staff-side secretary on the Whitley Councils for the Air Ministry and Civil Air Transport. From 1966, he instead took the lead on railway-related workers in the union.
Hanley was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party in 1967, but served only a single year, as in 1968 he was instead elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. In 1969/70, he additionally served as president of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions.
Hanley retired from all his union posts in 1970, and was succeeded on the executive council by Les Dixon, a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain. In retirement, he served on the Metrication Board.

Separating equilibrium

A separating equilibrium describes one type of perfect Bayesian equilibria that may arise in signaling games. The simplest example of such signaling games involves two players, who each take an action in sequence. The first player is privately informed with some payoff-relevant information, which is unavailable to the second player. After the first player acts, the second player chooses an action after observing the first player's action. A separating equilibrium is an equilibrium where the first player's action fully reveals her private information. Equivalently, in such an equilibrium, the first player's action is different for different private information.

Mohammed Matiul Islam

Mohammed Matiul Islam (born 24 January 1930) is a Bangladeshi government servant and entrepreneur. He is known for serving as the first Finance Secretary of Bangladesh. He was Bangladesh's envoy to the World Bank and later the United Nations for 8 and 11 years, respectively. He has started 4 companies, and is currently chairman of Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IIDFC), a Bangladeshi financial services firm.
Career.
Finally, in December, Indian Army forces bolstered by the Mukti Bahini liberated Dhaka, securing the Pakistani Army's surrender on 16 December. By 8 January, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto responded to international pressure and released Sheikh Mujib. He arrived back in Dhaka on the 10th, and sent for Islam on the 12th. By 17 January, Islam was appointed the first Finance Secretary of Bangladesh.
Government service in Bangladesh.
Finance secretary.
As he worked on building the country's financial system, Islam also traveled with Sheikh Mujib and the other heads of government, traveling first to Calcutta for talks with Indira Gandhi and the Indian Foreign minister in February. By March 1972 they were on their way to Moscow by way of Tbilisi, Georgian SSR. In Moscow, they were recognized by the Soviet Premier, Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin, the Prime Minister. Talks eventually yielded an agreement for the Russians to build a power plant in Ghorashal, as well as to assist in clearing mines, sunken ships and wreckage from the war out of Chittagong Harbor. Later in the year, Sheikh Mujib's delegation would visit Washington D.C. and London, and by September 1972 they had US$400 million in foreign currency reserves and the groundwork of a relationship with the IMF and World Bank.
World Bank.
Islam joined the World Bank in October, 1973. As Bangladesh's representative, he spearheaded the country's entry into the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and Asian Development Bank. Working as a block with India and Sri Lanka, Islam served as the Alternate Executive Director for Bangladesh while S.R. Sen served as the Executive Director. When Sen died of a heart attack, Islam took over his duties, managing Bangladesh's contributions to the IBRD, IDA, and IFC, the former two of which were both previously managed by Sen.
Islam served through July 1977, and campaigned vocally for equal treatment of even the poorest nations. For example, he campaigned against a proposed US Government Accountability Office audit of the World Bank on the grounds that all members of the bank were equal. If the US were to be given the opportunity to audit, then every other country should get that same opportunity. He worked closely with Robert McNamara, then President of the World Bank, to push for aid and assistance in debt restructuring, while in return working to eliminate barriers to foreign investment to make Bangladesh a more attractive investment opportunity. As Alternate Executive Director, he was also charged with ensuring that development projects made it through the bureaucracy with all necessary approvals so that work could begin in earnest.
During his time at the World Bank, Islam would return to Dhaka every six months to visit Sheikh Mujib. During the last of these visits, on 7 July 1975, Sheikh Mujib was trying to form his single political party BAKSAL as part of his campaign for one-party rule. He asked Islam to join, but Islam refused because he was a civil servant at heart, and thus had to remain apolitical. Mujib wanted Islam to return to Dhaka to help bolster what he knew was a tenuous position, but Islam refused on account of not wanting to disrupt his daughters' education in the US. Mujib offered to sign indefinite orders to keep Islam in the US, but Islam said he would return in a year. Eight days later, Sheikh Mujib was assassinated
Islam finished his tenure with the World Bank in July 1977, and subsequently returned to the Government of Bangladesh as Secretary of Industry.
Secretary of Industry.
As Secretary of Industry, Islam's job was to focus on the development of Bangladesh's private sector. His most notable achievement in this role was partnering with Dubai Bank, Limited to start Arab-Bangladesh Bank, now AB Bank, on 31 December 1981. However, with the assassination of Ziaur Rahman in 1981, Islam began looking for work away from the instability of the central government. As fate would have it, the Director-General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, or UNIDO, was visiting Dhaka at the time. Islam hosted him for dinner, and was offered a job at UNIDO 6 months later.
UNIDO.
Islam spent twelve years at UNIDO, six in Vienna and six in Delhi. During his time in Vienna, he served as a Senior Industrial Development Field Advisor and liaison between UNIDO and the World Bank. The World Bank was reliant on consultant services provided by UNIDO, and Islam would match up World Bank projects in need of consultants with UNIDO personnel specialized in those areas. In 1987, he transferred to Delhi, and worked as the UNIDO director for India and Bhutan. At no cost India and Bhutan, he would find projects in those countries where UNIDO could contribute expertise and match them with personnel and resources from abroad. He helped to bring foreign direct investment, and led a matchmaking effort to pair investors with local companies.
Entrepreneurship.
After finally retiring from government/NGO service in 1993, Islam would go on to start three major companies, one of which he is still on the board of.
In 1996, he started International Leasing and Financial Services, Ltd, his first non-bank Financial Services company. In 1998, he followed with National Housing and Finance, a non-banking development financial institution. Islam resigned from the boards of both of these companies in 2004 and 2003, respectively, so he could focus on his primary business venture. He started Industrial and Infrastructure Development Finance Company (IIDFC) in 2000 as a Non-banking Financial Institution (NBFI) under the Financial Institutions Act of 1993. As an NBFI, IIDFC cannot open savings or checking accounts, nor can it obtain letters of import. But it can accept term deposits, invest like a bank, and deal in foreign exchange. Since its inception, IIDFC has amassed 16.7 Billion BDT (US$200 Million) in assets as of 2015. Islam has continued to serve as chairman, and also retains a 3% stake in the company.
In 2003, Islam helped to start the Credit Ratings Agency of Bangladesh, or CRAB, by partnering with the Indian Credit Rating Agency, ICRA. He now serves as the vice chairman of CRAB, in addition to his ongoing work as IIDFC Chairman.
Awards and recognition.
In 2010, Islam's company, IIDFC, was awarded the HSBC-The Daily Star Climate Award for Climate Change Mitigation. His company financed Bangladesh's first green brick project, introducing a technology that uses 50% less energy to manufacture bricks. In 2011, Islam won The DHL-Daily Star Lifetime Achievement Award for his aggregate accomplishments over six decades of work in accounting, finance, and international development.

El Sur Ranch

The El Sur Ranch, located on the Big Sur coast of California, has been continuously operated as a cattle ranch since 1834. The approximately ranch straddles Highway 1 for from the mouth of the Little Sur River to the mouth of the Big Sur River and Andrew Molera State Park. Both the ranch and the park originally comprised the Rancho El Sur land grant given in 1834 by Governor José Figueroa to Juan Bautista Alvarado. It has been owned by the Hill family since 1955, who operate a commercial cow-calf operation.
Upon inheriting the ranch while still in college and pressed by increasingly high property taxes, the ranch's current owner James Hill began plans to develop two percent of the property. His plans were protested by Big Sur residents whose efforts persuaded the California Coastal Commission to deny his permit. In 1997, after being denied a permit to build a 200-room hotel at the mouth of Little Sur River, he agreed to a conservation easement covering the western-most parcel of land, at a cost of $11 million to California taxpayers. Most of this parcel is visible from Highway 1. The land to the west of the highway has historically used water from wells drilled in 1949 and 1984 near the Big Sur River. Hill has sought to increase water drawn from the wells to levels that according to one conservation group might harm endangered steelhead trout.
Location.
The original Spanish land grant was partitioned on March 21, 1891. The approximately El Sur Ranch comprises 13 of the original parcels. The ranch includes 12% of the private land in Big Sur. It straddles of Highway 1 stretching south from Hurricane Point, north of the mouth of the Little Sur River, to near the Big Sur River in Andrew Molera State Park, and it reaches inland over the coastal mountains into the south fork of the Little Sur valley to the border of the Los Padres National Forest.
Etymology.
The Spanish referred to the vast, relatively unexplored, coastal region to the south of their capital Monterey as "el país grande del sur", meaning "the big country of the south". This was often shortened to "el sur grande". The two major rivers were named El Rio Grande del Sur and El Rio Chiquito del Sur.
The first recorded use of the name "el Sur" (meaning "the South") was on a map of Rancho El Sur land grant given by Governor José Figueroa to Juan Bautista Alvarado on July 30, 1834. The first American use of the name "Sur" was by the U.S. Coast Survey in 1851, which renamed a point of land that looked like an island and was shaped like a trumpet, formerly known as "Morro de la Trompa" and "Punta que Parece Isla" during Spanish times, to Point Sur. The island was later graded to provide flat land for the Point Sur Light Station.
History.
Before the arrival of Europeans, the land was occupied by the Esselen people, who resided along the upper Carmel and Arroyo Seco Rivers, and along the Big Sur coast from near present-day Hurricane Point to the vicinity of Vicente Creek in the south.The native people were heavily affected by contact with Europeans, who established three Spanish Missions near them from 1770 to 1791. The Spanish forcibly assimilated the Indians, requiring them to labor in the mission fields, while feeding them an inadequate and foreign diet.
The native population was further decimated by diseases for which they had no immunity, including influenza, measles, tuberculosis, gonorrhea, and dysentery, which wiped out 90 percent of their people. Most of the Esselen people's villages within the current Los Padres National Forest were uninhabited by around 1820.
Spanish Governor José Figueroa granted two square leagues (totaling ) of land named Rancho El Sur in 1834 to Juan Bautista Alvarado, who later traded it to his uncle Juan Bautista Rogerio Cooper in exchange for Rancho Bolsa del Potrero. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Cooper filed a claim for Rancho El Sur with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and after year of litigation he received the legal land patent in 1866.
John B.R. Cooper married Geronima de la Encarnacion Vallejo. They had six daughters and one son. Their son John Baptist Henry Cooper helped his father with the cattle business on Rancho El Sur. He also successfully managed other lands owned by the family in the Salinas Valley. His sister Frances Molera inherited the southern half of Rancho El Sur. 
After John B. R. Cooper's death in 1872, the ranch was divided into four parts: their son John Bautista Henry Cooper received the first section. On March 12, 1871, 40 year old John B. H. Cooper had married 18 year old Martha Brawley in 1871, a cousin of Abraham Lincoln, at the San Carlos Cathedral. John B. R. Cooper's widow Maria Encarnación Vallejo also received one-quarter of the land, and their two surviving daughters, Anna Maria de Guadalupe Cooper and Francisca Guadalupe Amelia Cooper, received the remaining portions.
John Baptist Henry Cooper built a new home on Rancho El Sur Ranch but died soon after its completion on June 21, 1899, before he could move in, leaving the ranch to his wife and children. Martha (Brawley) Cooper received of her the land, and over time bought the remainder from her husband's two sisters. She sold 5,000 acres in 1928 to businessman Harry Cole Hunt of Carmel-by-the-Sea. He had been president of the Tidewater Oil Company and a director of Dabney and Hogan Petroleum Companies. He was the founder of Del Monte Properties and with his wife Jane Selby (nee Hayne) owned the El Sur Ranch.
Modern ownership.
The current owner, James Jerome Hill III, is descended from railroad magnate James J. Hill. His son Louis W. Hill bought considerable land in Pebble Beach, California when it was first developed by the Pacific Improvement Company with the intent to attract the wealthy. The family enjoyed the mild winters on the California Central Coast and beginning in 1910 often wintered there. Louis' son Cortlandt Taylor Hill built a vacation home in Pebble Beach. Cortlandt married Blanche Lucille Ellen (née Wilbur) in 1934. She had previously been married to George Randolph Hearst, the eldest son of publishing tycoon William Randolph Hearst. The elder Hearst had nurtured an ambition to buy large areas of the Big Sur coast at one time. Blanche married Cortlandt Hill on March 31, 1934, at the Ritz Tower on Park Avenue in New York City. They divorced in 1952. Cortlandt married Marion Ballaire in 1953. They had three children, including James Jerome Hill III, named after his uncle and great-grandfather.
In 1955 Cortlandt bought the El Sur Ranch from Harry C. Hunt. His son James spent many weekends and summer vacations on the ranch. Cortlandt and Marion were divorced in March 1972. Cortlandt married Blanche C. Hauserman (née Christian) on January 9, 1973. She had opened the first commercial building and ski shop at Vail Ski Resort, and both were enthusiastic leaders in the snow skiing community.
Conservation easement.
When Cortlandt died on March 28, 1978, his only child James inherited the approximately ranch and other family properties while he was still in college. James looked for income producing opportunities to offset taxes. He contracted with a San Francisco architectural firm to develop a plan for the property that would produce income but keep it undivided and devoted to cattle ranching. Hill initially proposed a 200-room hotel, conference center, and restaurant on land west of Highway 1 adjacent to the Little Sur River, and a cabin complex on the east side hidden from the highway. The plan utilized only 2% of the land.
The California Coastal Conservancy worked with Hill to reduce the environmental impact. He later submitted a revised plan to Monterey County for a 100-room hotel in three or four buildings and a 200-seat restaurant, plus 98 private home sites situated so they could not be seen from Highway 1. He also sought a conservation easement on . The Monterey County Board of Supervisors approved the plan in 1984.
In August 1983, the California Coastal Conservancy announced an agreement to pay Hill $1 million for a conservation and scenic easement on on the east side of Highway 1, south of Little Sur River, and to purchase . Hill also agreed to donate the cost of a conservation easement on another . Hill retained the right to develop the remaining . There was considerable local opposition to the plan. Fifty Big Sur residents attended a meeting of the Coastal Commission in April 1985 to protest the deal with the Coastal Conservancy. The Big Sur Land Trust also voiced their opposition. The Big Sur Local Use Plan was under consideration by the California Coastal Commission, and the supervisors withdrew the plan. Hill's development deal was voted down by the commissioners in a vote of 10 to 1.
The fight over Hill's development rights played a role in tightening rules in the Big Sur Local Coastal Plan. The county conducted additional hearings and modified the land use plan to further restrict larger developments. The Coastal Commission accepted the revised land use plan and rejected Hill's application for a permit. The amended Big Sur Local Coastal plan was approved by the Coastal Commission on April 10, 1986. The Big Sur land use policies are some of the most restrictive local-use standards in California, and are widely regarded as one of the most restrictive development protections anywhere.
In 1991, Hill began negotiating with the Big Sur Land Trust for a conservation easement on of land visible to the public, including all of the lands visible from Highway 1. Monterey County eventually agreed to pay $11.5 million to Hill for the conservation easement. This was almost half of the $25 million set aside by a 1988 parks bond initiative (Proposition 70) to preserve Big Sur land. The payment was the largest in California history. In exchange, Hill and any future owner gave up the right to develop the acres included in the easement. It gave Hill a one-time tax credit of $4.5 million, the difference between the prior market value and the value after the ability to develop the land was removed. He also received the benefit of an ongoing reduction in property taxes. Hill still has the right to develop the remaining within the strict limitations imposed by the Big Sur Land Use Plan. The El Sur Ranch comprises 14 parcels, and only a single parcel astride Highway 1 is subject to the conservation easement. 
Current operations.
Hill continues to run a commercial cow-calf operation with about 450 head on the ranch. The cattle graze on natural grasslands in the mountains on the east side of Highway 1 until the fields dry during the spring, when the cattle are relocated to pasture on eleven fenced and irrigated fields totaling on the west side of Highway 1. Hill lives in the family residence in Pebble Beach, California, on the Monterey Peninsula.Public records estimate Hill Properties grosses from $243,000 to $760,000 a year from its land, cattle and other operations.
Water rights litigation.
In 1905, Martha Cooper Vasquez, John B. H. Cooper's widow, was granted a permit to use water from the Big Sur River to irrigate land along the coast. In 1928, after Harry Hunt bought the land, he began raising alfalfa, barley, corn, potatoes and carrots using water diverted from the Big Sur River. In 1938 he returned to raising feed for cattle. Hill irrigates with water from two wells, the first drilled in 1949, and the second in 1984, near the Big Sur River.
In 1990, the California Department of Water Resources filed a complaint with the California State Water Resources Control Board stating that the El Sur Ranch's wells were drawing water from the underflow of the Big Sur River, and Hill was required to apply for a Water Right Permit. Hill has supplied studies that contradict the state's findings, and has been engaged in ongoing litigation and negotiations with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. He is seeking a permit to use a maximum of 1,615 acre-feet per year, based on a 20-year rolling average of 1,200 acre-feet per year. The California Department of Parks and Recreation, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the California Sportfishing Protection Alliance claim the water Hill is diverting is reducing the flow of the Big Sur River and harming the threatened steelhead habitat.
Hill is striving to preserve his right to use water that the ranch must have access to if it is to continue operations. The ranch has relied on water from the Big Sur River or from permitted wells near the river from the time of the original land grant.
Community service.
Hill has allowed fire services to use his ranch as a base of operations during fires. During the Soberanes Fire in 2016, a fire retardant base operated out of the ranch. He has also allowed helicopters to draw water from his ponds for firefighting efforts. Hill was given an honorary lifetime membership in the Big Sur Volunteer Fire Brigade to recognize the ranch's contribution of resources and personnel in fighting the Basin Complex Fire in 2008. The ranch has supported fire fighting efforts in 1977, 1986, 1997, 1999, 2000, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2016. It also supports the Big Sur Health Center.
Hill privately donated over $100,000 to buy and refurbish a surplus MRAP for use by the Del Rey Oaks and neighboring police departments. Hill is a volunteer on the city's police reserve force. He agreed through his company NorthTree Fire International to maintain the vehicle for five years.
The Ventana Wildlife Society has been engaged since 1996 in a program to restore the California condor population from near extinction. Hill allows the society to use a ranch road to deliver animal carcasses for the condors to feed on to a location outside the ranch. Hill later established a second feeding location near by on his land where he has brought carcasses of his own cattle to feed the condors. In 2011, he told a reporter that "Over the last six or seven years, we've delivered 30,000 to 40,000 pounds of carcasses." To prevent the Condors from ingesting lead, Hill has also instructed his employees to use copper bullets when protecting the cattle from predators.
Public access.
In "Gion vs. City of Santa Cruz (1970) 2 Cal. 3d 29", the Supreme Court of California held that "certain coastal property who allowed the public to use the property for recreational purposes over a period of years thereby impliedly dedicated property rights to the public." The legal argument established a method by which the courts could require land owners to allow public access to their property. The concept of "implied dedication by public use" is predicated on prior public access having created de facto public use. If the owner fails to post "No Trespass" signs and allows the public to cross the private property to fish, swim, picnic, and view the ocean, the state can find that an easement for public access for recreational purposes exists.
California passed a law supporting a coastal trail within view of the ocean. The El Sur Ranch is already traversed by the Little Sur Trail which begins within the boundaries of the ranch, along with the Old Coast Road and Highway 1. Hill is opposed to another public right-of-way through the ranch. 
At the mouth of the Little Sur river are some of the largest sand dunes on the Big Sur coast. The mouth of the Little Sur River, the sand dunes, and the mile-long Little Sur River beach are within the boundaries of the El Sur Ranch. Hill maintains a secure fence and has prominently posted no trespassing signs on the fence along Highway 1 as suggested by legal precedent. While the beach below the mean high tide line is open to the public, the law does not permit individuals to trespass on private property to reach the public beach. Individuals who trespass to reach the beach have been cited.

The Murray Valley Standard

The Murray Valley Standard is a bi-weekly newspaper published in Murray Bridge, South Australia, founded in late 1934 and published continuously since then. Its main office is on Adelaide Road, Murray Bridge. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media.
History.
Murray Bridge's oldest locally produced newspaper, "The" "Murray Valley Standard", was first published in Murray Bridge on 23 November 1934. Its main rival at the time was the "Murray Bridge Advertiser" (a sub-publication of the "Mount Barker Courier"), which soon sold its local rights to Maurice Parish. From 21 December 1934, the subtitle changed to ""With which is incorporated 'The Murray Bridge advertiser' and 'The Mannum mercury'". From 5 June 1942 the words '"Murray Bridge advertiser'" were omitted from the masthead, and from 6 June 1958 "'The Mannum mercury"' was also omitted from the sub-title.
Its first owner was former Liberal M.P. and Murray Bridge's first mayor, Maurice Parish, who purchased the printing business of Bert Lawrie in 1934. In 1950 Parish sold the newspaper and printing business to his editor, Frank Hambidge. In 1967, Hambidge retired, handing over management to his son Michael Hambidge, and the "Standard" became the first South Australian country newspaper printed by the Web-Offset method. By 1955, 2500 copies of the "Standard" were being printed weekly, and circulation was up to 7,450 in 1971. Rural Press first bought shares in the newspaper in 1986, assuming full control in December 1994, and was itself purchased by Fairfax Media in 2007.
Southern Review (supplement).
The "Southern Review" (12 May 1972 – 23 March 1973) was a short-lived supplement (only 20 issues were released) that was printed in Murray Bridge for five country newspapers, namely: "The Islander", "Murray Valley Standard, Pinnaroo &amp; Border Times, Southern Argus," and "Victor Harbour Times."
Distribution.
"The Murray Valley Standard" distribution covers an area of over 28,000km2, from Meningie, Swan Reach, Mannum. Tintinara, Callington. Lameroo, Kanmantoo, and Karoonda. It has a claimed weekly readership of 7,100. Originally weekly, the "Standard" published twice-weekly in 1973, and has published on Tuesdays and Thursdays since 1981. As with other Rural Press publications, an online version of the paper is available too.

Pinkus Kartin

Pinkus Kartin (pseudonym: "Andrzej Szmidt"; 1914 – 20 May 1942) was a Polish-Jewish communist activist and anti-Nazi resistance fighter.
Biography.
Kartin was born in Lutsk. He joined the Young Communist League of Poland at a young age and later the Communist Party of Poland (KPP). Around 1936–1937 he went to Paris to study at the Sorbonne.
In January 1938, Kartin went to fight in the Spanish Civil War in the ranks of the XIII International Brigade. After being wounded, he returned to Paris in April 1939, where he edited "Dziennik Ludowy", a Polish-language communist newspaper banned by the French authorities.
Kartin was recognized as a Soviet citizen when his birth town of Lutsk was incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940. In 1941 he went to the Soviet Union and received military training. At the end of 1941 Kartin was parachuted into the Warsaw area, tasked with building an underground communist party and an armed resistance force in order to fight the German occupants.
Kartin was charged with organizing the underground communist party and combat units inside the Warsaw Ghetto. In February 1942 Kartin and Józef Lewartowski met with Mordechai Anielewicz and other leaders of the Jewish Combat Organization. As a result, the Anti-Fascist Bloc was formed in March 1942. Kartin was also a founding member of the Polish Workers' Party in 1942 and trained partisans for Gwardia Ludowa.
In May 1942, Kartin was arrested by the Gestapo and taken to Pawiak Prison in Warsaw, where he was interrogated and then murdered. It later emerged that a Gestapo agent who had infiltrated the Polish communists was responsible for his arrest.
Posthumously, Kartin was awarded the Order of the Cross of Grunwald in 1945.

Development of the franchise began in November 2016 with the announcement of an animated web series by Machinima, based on the upcoming toyline. In January 2017, Hasbro held a fan-vote to decide which character would become the next Prime in the franchise. In February, it was decided that Optimus Primal would become the next Prime.
Development.
The franchise was first announced on November 29, 2016 as the final installment of the '. Hasbro announced that it would once again partner with Machinima—after having previously worked with them on the animated web series adaptation of '—to produce the adaptations for ' and '. Eric Calderon, showrunner of "Combiner Wars", was confirmed to have returned for both "Titans Return" and "Power of the Primes".
In January 2017, Hasbro created a poll allowing fans to vote which Transformer will become the next Prime. The vote occurred in two stages. During the first, fans voted for the leaders of three different personality factions; honor, order and chaos. Honor was represented by Arcee, Ultra Magnus and Hound; Order by Megatron, and Shockwave and Chaos by Thunderwing, Optimus Primal and an Unknown Evil (). The winners of the first round were Ultra Magnus, Star Saber and Optimus Primal, advancing into the second round alongside the Unknown Evil as a wildcard. The poll ended a month later on February 18, and Optimus Primal was chosen as the next Prime.
At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, Hasbro revealed during their panel some of the figures of the toyline. The figures shown were those of Liege Maximo, Dreadwind, Blackwing, Starscream, Jazz and Rodimus Prime. During Hasbro's first HasCon fan convention in September, the new Combiner Volcanicus was revealed. The combiner is composed of the five Dinobots: Grimlock, Slug, Sludge, Snarl and Swoop.
Controversy.
In November 2017, a fan noticed that a tiny print found on the vehicle mode of Jazz featured scribbles that, when translated from the Cybertronian alphabet, read out "MAGA", which is an abbreviation for "Make America Great Again", the slogan of President Donald Trump. Hasbro soon released a statement that the issue had been investigated and that a vendor had placed the acronym without authorization. The company also clarified that they are addressing the issue with the vendor and that they "do not intend for [their] products to carry political messages, apologiz[ing] to anyone who was offended by this message".
Comic book.
According to John Barber, editor of IDW Publishing, the ongoing "Transformers" comics published by the company will not feature a crossover event based on Power of the Primes. IDW had previously published crossover events based on Combiner Wars and Titans Return.

Window shopping

Window shopping, sometimes called browsing, refers to an activity in which a consumer browses through or examines a store's merchandise as a form of leisure or external search behaviour without a current intent to buy. Depending on the individual, window shopping can be used as a pastime or to obtain information about a product's development, brand differences, or sale prices.
The development of window shopping, as a form of recreation, is strongly associated with the rise of the middle classes in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe. Glazing was a central feature of the grand shopping arcades that spread across Europe from the late 18th century. Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes.
Traditionally, window shopping involves visiting a brick-and-mortar store to examine a product but is also done online in recent times due to the availability of the internet and e-commerce. A person who enjoys window shopping is known as a window shopper.
History.
The development of window shopping, as a form of recreation, is strongly associated with the rise of the middle classes in seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe. As standards of living improved in the 17th century, consumers from a broad range of social backgrounds began to purchase goods that were in excess of basic necessities. An emergent middle class or bourgeosie stimulated demand for luxury goods and the act of shopping came to be seen as a pleasurable pastime or form of entertainment. Shopping for pleasure became a particularly important activity for middle and upper-class women, since it allowed them to enter the public sphere without the need for a chaperone.
Prior to the 17th century, glazed shop windows were virtually unknown. Instead, early shopkeepers typically had a front door with two wider openings on either side, each covered with shutters. The shutters were designed to open so that the top portion formed a canopy while the bottom was fitted with legs so that it could serve as a shopboard. Scholars have suggested that the medieval shopper's experience was very different. Many stores had openings onto the street from which they served customers. Glazed windows, which were rare during the medieval period, meant that shop interiors were dark places which militated against detailed examination of the merchandise. Shoppers, who rarely entered the shop, had relatively few opportunities to inspect the merchandise prior to consumption.
Glazing was widely used from the early 18th century. English commentators pointed to the speed at which glazing was installed, Daniel Defoe, writing in 1726, noted, "Never was there such painting and guildings, such sashings and looking-glasses as the shopkeepers as there is now." The widespread availability of plate glass in the 18th century led shop owners to build windows that spanned the full lengths of their shops for the display of merchandise to draw in customers. One of the first Londoners to experiment with this new glazing in a retail context was the tailor Francis Place at his Charing Cross establishment.
In Paris, where pedestrians lived with the virtual absence of pavements, retailers were eager to attract window shoppers by providing a safe shopping environment away from the filthy and noisy streets and began to construct rudimentary arcades, which eventually evolved into the grand arcades of the late 18th century and which dominated retail throughout the 19th century. Opening in 1771, the "Colisée", situated on the Champs Elysées, consisted of three arcades, each with ten shops, all running off a central ballroom. For Parisians, the location was seen as too remote and the arcade closed within two years of opening. However, the Galerie de Bois, a series of wooden shops linked to the ends of the Palais-Royal (pictured), opened in 1786 and became a central part of Parisian social life. Within a decade, the Palais shopping complex added many more shops as well as cafés and theatres. In its heyday, the Palais-Royal was a complex of gardens, shops and entertainment venues situated on the external perimeter of the old palace grounds, under the original colonnades. The area boasted some 145 boutiques, cafés, salons, hair salons, bookshops, museums, and numerous refreshment kiosks as well as two theatres. The retail outlets specialised in luxury goods such as fine jewellery, furs, paintings and furniture designed to appeal to the wealthy elite.
Inspired by the success of the Palais-Royal, retailers across Europe erected grand shopping arcades and largely followed the Parisian model which included extensive use of pane glass. Not only were the shopfronts made of pane glass, but a characteristic feature of the modern shopping arcade was the use of glass in an atrium-styled roofline, which allowed for natural light and reduced the need for candles or electric lighting. Modern grand arcades opened across Europe and in the Antipodes. The Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791) and Passage du Claire in 1799; London's Piccadilly Arcade (opened in 1810); Paris's Passage Colbert (1826) and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele (1878). London's Burlington Arcade, which opened in 1819, positioned itself as an elegant and exclusive venue designed to attract the elite, from the outset. Some of the earliest examples of shopping arcades with expansive glazed shop-windows appeared in Paris. These were among the first modern shops to make use of glazed windows to display merchandise. Other notable nineteenth-century grand arcades included the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels which was inaugurated in 1847, Istanbul's Çiçek Pasajı opened in 1870 and Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II, first opened in 1877.
Promenading in these arcades became a popular nineteenth-century pastime for the emerging middle classes. Designed to attract the genteel middle class, these shopping arcades came to be the place to shop and to be seen. Individual stores fitted with long glass exterior windows allowed the emerging middle classes to window shop and indulge in fantasies, even when they may not have been able to afford the high retail prices of the luxury outlets inside the arcade.
By the 1900s the popularity of window displays had heightened and the window display became more elaborate, continuing to attract not only those that wanted to make purchases but also passers-by that appreciated beauty. To achieve the right aesthetics, store owners and managers would hire decorators or window dressers to attractively arrange merchandise in the shop windows; indeed, the professional window display design soon became an object used to lure shoppers into the stores.
As a form of leisure.
Most men mistakenly assume that you look into show windows to find something to buy. Women know better. They enjoy window-shopping for its own sake. Store windows, when you look into them with pleasure-seeking eyes, are strange places full of mental adventure. They contain first clues to dozens of treasure hunts which if you follow them, lead to as many different varieties of treasure. – MW Marston, "The Rotarian", September 1938
Window shopping was synonymous with being in the city and moreover offered women a legitimate reason to be able to move around in public without a chaperone. In the late 1800s it was a minor scandal to move around in public without a male chaperone because not everyone was happy about the intrusion of women into urban life. Many looked down on females who walked the streets alone and even newspaper columnists condemned their shopping habits as "salacious acts of public consumerism." However, the rise of window displays soon gave women a foothold in the modern city, and for many, a new pastime. Soon, housewives started roaming the city under the pretext of shopping. "Shopping" in this context did not always involve an actual purchase, it was more about the pleasures of perusing, taking in the sights, the displays, and the people.
Prior to the introduction of plate glass for shops and the development of window shopping, people could not just enter shops without the intention to make a purchase; even less so to walk around just for fun or to pass time. Most stores before and during World War II were small, with not enough space for people to just go and linger about. The early department stores pioneered the transformation of traditional customers into modern consumers and of mere "merchandise" into spectacular "commodity signs" or "symbolic goods". Thus they laid the cornerstones of a culture we still inhabit. Peoples' patronage of stores transformed from just walking in, buying and leaving to "shopping", especially for females. Shopping no longer consisted of haggling with the seller but of the ability to dream with one's eyes open, to gaze at commodities and enjoy their sensory spectacle.
With the development of large out-of-town malls, especially after WWII, and more recently sales outlets in central high streets, shopping places are becoming hybrid spaces mixing goods and leisure in varied proportions. Traditional small forms of stores and retail distributors have been replaced with large malls and shopping centres which now characterize contemporary Western retail. In these modern times, though malls and shopping centres have fixed prices, one can enter and leave as one wants without purchasing any item. It has become a place of socialization or leisure for most people, especially women. 
Indeed, the pleasures, meanings and competences which consumers put to work in shopping centres and department stores are far broader than their ability to bargain on price and purchase objects: in these spaces people do not just buy things, they keep up with the world of things, spending time with friends in a polished environment filled with both fantasy and information. In fact, around a third of those who enter a shopping centre leave without having bought anything. In practice, thus, window shopping is an assorted activity, done differently according to the shopper's social identity.
Online window shopping.
There are some types of consumers who spend a lot of time in online marketplaces but never purchase anything or even have the intention to buy and since there are no "transportation costs" required on visiting an online store site, it is much easier than visiting a brick-and-mortar store. This cluster of online consumers are called "e-window shoppers", as they are predominantly driven by stimulation and are only motivated to surf the internet by visiting interesting shopping websites. These e-shoppers appear as curious shoppers that are only interested in seeing what is out there rather than trying to negotiate to obtain the lowest possible price. These online window shoppers use news and pictures of products to seek hedonic experience as well as keep themselves up to date with the industry status and new trends.

Uganda Muslim Liberation Army

The Uganda Muslim Liberation Army (abbreviated UMLA) was a Muslim rebel group in Uganda. Its fighters were mainly from among the Baganda ethnic group's Muslim minority along with some non-Baganda Muslims. The group was formed in 1995 in opposition to the Museveni government after accusing it of persecuting Muslims in Buganda.
History.
The UMLA formally declared war on Yoweri Museveni's Ugandan government in January 1995. In February 1995, the group launched its first military operations near Lake Albert, which failed and resulted in their retreat to Zaire (present-day the Democratic Republic of Congo).
Museveni denounced the rebels as Islamic fundamentalists, whose sole purpose was to destabilize the Great Lakes Region as "agents of [Sudan's] NIF government". The self-proclaimed purpose of the UMLA was to topple Museveni's government and stop the alleged mistreatment of Muslims in Buganda by them. The UMLA claimed that Museveni's National Resistance Army (NRA) had committed war crimes and massacres against Muslims during the Ugandan Bush War, a claim which Museveni denies.
In 1996, the UMLA merged with the Allied Democratic Movement, remnants of the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU), and militant members of the local Tablighi Jamaat to form the Allied Democratic Forces, allegedly with assistance from the Sudanese government. Despite not waging a significant insurgency, the group was a primary focus of bitter relations between the Sudanese and Ugandan governments.

1806 Edirne incident

The 1806 Edirne Incident was an armed confrontation between the New Order Troops ("Nizam-i Djedit)" of Ottoman Sultan Selim III and a coalition of Balkan magnates, "ayans", and the region's Janissary garrisons that occurred in Thrace throughout the summer of 1806. The cause of the incident was Selim III's attempt to expand the New Order's permanent presence into Rumelia through the establishment of New Order barracks in the region's cities. The ultimate outcome of the confrontation was the retreat of imperial forces back to Istanbul and to Anatolia, constituting a deathblow to Selim III's ambitions of expanding his reformed army, as well as a major blow to his legitimacy. The outcome of the Edirne Incident would play no small part in his deposition the following May.
Causes.
At its core, the Edirne Incident is a reaction to Selim III's establishment of the New Order army following the Ottoman's overwhelming defeat in the Ottoman Russian War 1787-92. This army was break from Ottoman military tradition and was based on western military principles. The army was met with heavy opposition from entrenched power groups, notably the Janissaries and the "ayans", who saw the New Order as a threat to the established order of things, as well as from many in the wider public who detested the introduction of conscription, never before used in the empire, and the subsequent tax increases needed to outfit the new force. Many also felt that the new force was un-Ottoman in its nature and constituted a concession to the west.
Incident.
In April 1806, under the guise of sending an expeditionary force against Serbian rebels in Belgrade, Selim III ordered Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha to take his 24,000 troops into Thrace and establish New Order barracks there, ostensibly to protect the populace from the Mountaineers, a general term for organized Balkan banditry. The first attempt at this task was in the city of Tekirdağ and was immediately met with violent opposition from the populace. The local kadi refused to take part in establishing the barracks and though promptly replaced, his replacement and all his retinue were lynched by a mob of mostly janissaries after reading out the imperial orders on the subject. To further aggravate matters, the city refused to admit the New Order into the city or to turn over those responsible for the murders. Subsequently, the central government sent two corvettes to blockade the city, to no effect, before authorizing them to bombard it. Under this onslaught the city finally capitulated in July. This was only a small part of Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha's troubles in Thrace however. Throughout the spring and summer, the leading "ayan" of Edirne, Dağdevirenoğlu Mehmed, had been rallying opposition to the New Order under the rationale that it would mean the undermining of traditional Janissary and "ayan" privileges in the region. Under his ad hoc command, according to the British consul of Bucharest, 186 local "ayans" signed a secret agreement to resist the New Order and to overthrow Selim III and, in his place, install the future Mustafa IV. Importantly, this received the support of Ismail of Ruse, one of the most powerful figures in the Ottoman Empire and whose retinue included future Grand Vizier Mustafa Bayraktar, as well as the current Grand Vizier Hafiz Ismail Ağa. Ismail of Ruse had been an early supporter of the New Order and ostensibly claimed to support its mission, thus his secret change of heart dealt a serious blow to Selim III's ambitions. This agreement encouraged the violence against the New Order as they faced attacks on their supply lines and received no provisional support from the towns and cities along their path. The threat of large scale civil war also loomed on the horizon as Rumelian "ayans" rallied their forces which the French ambassador to Istanbul, Horace Sébastiani, estimated to number around 80,000 men. Against these obstacles, New Order troops were forced to halt their progress in Havsa in mid-July, after fighting a force of Janissaries, before retreating to the town of Çorlu in the east where further retreat was only prevented by the appearance of Selim III himself. Even there though, they were only able to enter the town after besieging it. As the situation worsened the Porte became distinctly aware of the danger that the incident presented and began to close dozens of coffee shops in the capital in an attempt to prevent the rebellion from spreading into Istanbul. In mid-August, Ismail of Ruse was assassinated on his farm by an associate and while welcome news to the New Order, Selim III, on September 19, ultimately decided to order his troops to leave Silivri and return to Istanbul. Due to mediation spearheaded by local "ayan", and suspected rebel, Ismail of Serres, an escalation in the conflict was prevented.
The Aftermath.
Though the center attempted to spin the return of the New Order as an example of Selim III's generosity to his subjects in avoiding a civil war, it was in fact an incredible humiliation for the Sultan and a deathblow for his ambitions of centralization and reform. Following the incident, a reshuffling of the cabinet occurred with collaborators as well as "New Orderist" officials replaced by more conciliatory figures. The Grand Vizier was replaced by the Agha of the Janissaries Ibrahim Hilmi Pasha, the Grand Mufti dismissed, and Kadi Abdurrahman Pasha dismissed. No serious attempts were made after this point by the Sultan to expand the New Order which was eventually disbanded during his deposition in a futile attempt to appease the rebels.

The book review published in "The Record" "read: ""Asides from facts and figures on the marginalized, his book has anecdotes and reviews of key political events, and includes the reactions of various Nepali power-centers and the international community towards Nepal’s constitution."
As author, he also wrote Op-Ed on current affairs of politics, constitution, human rights, rule of law and democracy for The Kathmandu Post and its sister publication Kantipur in Nepali language and other online news portals, including Online Khabar and Setopati.

Each character has several attacks and a few defenses. The character with the highest speed stat starts by attacking an opponent's character followed by character's with slower speed stats. As characters are knocked out, they lose their ability to act. A player without any characters, loses.

The Islander (Australian newspaper)

The Islander is a weekly newspaper published in Kingscote, South Australia, founded in, and published continuously since, 1967. In addition to local news and events, "Council Matters", the Kangaroo Island Council's information to the community, is also published in the newspaper every Thursday It was later sold to Rural Press in 1995, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media.
History.
Historically, there were several different newspapers issued on Kangaroo Island prior to the "Islander". For example, the 4-page "Kangaroo Island Courier" (1907-1951), a weekly newspaper which was issued on the island on Saturdays. In June 1951, it was incorporated by the "Glenelg Guardian", and a later separate insert version of that newspaper, "The K.I. Courier" (1957-1968) was also published by the "Glenelg Guardian".
The first issue of "The Islander" was on 19 January 1967, continuing weekly until 4 August 1982. The newspaper quickly went on to absorb its main rival publication, "The K.I. Courier." Between 11 August 1982 (issue No. 754) and 27 May 1987 (No. 994) it was briefly renamed as the "Islander News Pictorial". The newspaper was sold to Rural Press (formerly part of Fairfax Media) in 1995. It celebrated its 50 years in 2017 with a 1960s retro-party event at its main office on Osmond Street, Kingscote.
Distribution.
Given Kangaroo Island's population of approximately 4,500 and the paper's weekly circulation of 2,000 copies the average issue readership is calculated to be around 3,200. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online.
Preservation.
The South Australian Library carries microfiche versions of the newspaper from the 1960s to 1970s, accessible on-line.

United States Bridge Championships - Open

The United States Bridge Championships (USBC) is a yearly competition held to select either one or two teams that will represent the United States at international competition for the game of contract bridge. The general conditions of contest used by the United States Bridge Federation can be found here. There are multiple events in the USBC including Open, Women, Seniors, and Mixed divisions. This article contains information about the Open division in which anyone of any age or gender can compete.
History and vocabulary.
From May 17–21 of 1989, the "team trials" to determine which team would represent the United States was held in Memphis, TN. At that time, the trials had no name, and the name "United States Bridge Championship" was conceived by Matt Guagliardo, who was then the Director of Education for the ACBL, but was still actively involved in promoting bridge. Mr. Guagliardo, in collaboration with Barbara McBride, who was also the graphic artist for the ACBL, created the USBS logo, which was flag-shaped with a dark-blue square in the upper-left corner, with a white star, and a black spade inside the star. The words "United," "States," "and "Bridge" are in red, and are stacked vertically opposite the square. The word "Championship" is also in red, and is lengthwise below the blue square, and other verbiage. There is a blue line underneath the word "Championship," and a blue line extending from the right border of the square over the word "United."
T-shirts were printed and given to the caddies, who worked the sectional tournament that ran concurrently to the USBC, to wear. On the front, the T-shirts had the USBC logo, "Memphis, Tennessee" and "May 17–21, 1989." The back had printed in blue, in an arc shape, "A BIG DEAL FOR MEMPHIS," with four Aces printed below it, each with a different suit designation. The words and cards are all printed in blue.
Concurrent with the USBC was a sectional tournament, and the concluding event was a Swiss Teams, which was the norm then. In cooperation with the late Ralph Cohen, something was done, at least for the first time in the United States, and, quite probably, the world. This is what happened: The last round of the sectional Swiss Teams had "boards" ("hands') that were duplicated before the Swiss Teams began by Ralph and his small hand-picked group, and kept under ultra-tight security. Thus, in the last round of the "Swiss," at every table
everyone was playing the same set of hands.
Immediately after the Swiss event ended, players adjourned to a large room, where, on Vu-Graph, they were able to see the same set of hands played live by contestants in the USBC. The showing of the hands was accompanied by expert commentary. Like the USBC itself, the concept of having the hands played by "ordinary" players in a competitive environment, then being able to see those same hands played by world-caliber experts was conceived by Matt Guagliardo.
The previous history was grossly inaccurate, and t-shirts autographed by players who competed in the 1989 event, and who are now deceased, give evidence that the term "United States Bridge Championship" was coined more than a decade before the formation of the United States Bridge Federation.
Summary of past USBCs.
Below is a table of teams that have won the Open USBCs and how they fared in international competition. In every odd number year, the winners of the USBC Open division get to compete in the Bermuda Bowl that has existed since 1950.

Cofetuzumab pelidotin

Cofetuzumab pelidotin (INN; development code PF-06647020) is an experimental antibody-drug conjugate in development for the treatment of cancer. It was created by Stemcentrx and is being developed by Pfizer. The drug is an anti-PTK7 monoclonal antibody linked to auristatin-0101, an auristatin microtubule inhibitor.
Antibody-drug conjugates use a monoclonal antibody that binds to tumors cells linked to a cytotoxic drug that then kills the cells. This allows the drug to selectively target the cells that the antibody binds to.
PTK7 is expressed by many tumors, including ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer. Early clinical trial results show a 50% response rate in patients with triple negative breast cancer and an almost complete response in ovarian tumors resistant to platinum-based chemotherapies.

Ravulizumab

Ravulizumab, sold under the brand name Ultomiris, is a humanized monoclonal antibody complement inhibitor medication designed for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. It is designed to bind to and prevent the activation of Complement component 5 (C5).
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is characterized by red blood cell destruction, anemia (red blood cells unable to carry enough oxygen to tissues), blood clots, and impaired bone marrow function (not making enough blood cells). In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, proteins known as the 'complement system', which is part of the immune system, become overactive because of a genetic mutation and start to attack the patients' own red blood cells. Ravulizumab, is a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) designed to attach to the C5 protein, which is part of the complement system. By attaching to the C5 protein, the medicine blocks its effect and thereby reduces the destruction of red blood cells.
The most common side effects are upper respiratory tract infection (nose and throat infection), nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and throat) and headache. The most serious side effect is meningococcal infection, a bacterial infection caused by "Neisseria meningitidis" that can cause meningitis and blood poisoning.
Medical uses.
In the United States, ravulizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults and children one month of age and older with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and for the treatment of adults and children one month of age and older with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA).
In the European Union, ravulizumab is indicated in the treatment of adults with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria:
Names.
Ravulizumab is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN).
History.
Ravulizumab was developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. It was engineered from eculizumab to have a longer-lasting effect.
Ravulizumab was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in December 2018. In April 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the granting of a conditional marketing authorization for ravulizumab. Ravulizumab was approved for medical use in the EU in July 2019.

To gain a thorough understanding of the business he worked at all the different jobs in the Saut-du-Tarn factory.
He became general secretary of the company in 1921, a director, then president and chief executive officer.
Throughout his career Jacques de Nervo was involved in the steel industry.

Susan M. Collins (economist)

Susan M. Collins is an American scholar in the fields of economics and public policy. As of July 16, 2020, she is the provost of the University of Michigan.
She received her B.A. in economics "summa cum laude" from Harvard University in 1980, and her Ph.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1984. She has held various teaching positions at Harvard, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, and also served on the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 1990 and was a visiting scholar at the International Monetary Fund in 2001.
Collins is the Edward M. Gramlich Professor of Public Policy and a professor of economics at the University of Michigan, where she also served as dean of the Ford School from 2007 to 2017. She is a nonresident senior fellow in the Economic Studies program at the Brookings Institution and is a member on the board of directors at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.
Collins was involved in the controversy surrounding the University of Michigan's reopening during the COVID-19 pandemic. On September 8, 2020, the university's graduate student employees went on strike because of concerns related to the university's pandemic response. As the university's chief academic officer, Collins was involved in negotiations with the graduate students while also urging students not to disrupt campus operations and claiming that the strike was illegal because it was not directly related to "wages, hours, or working conditions." The students disagreed, claiming that the strike directly related to the university's failure to provide a safe working environment which was required by the contract it agreed to only months prior. In a publicly broadcast question and answer session on September 15, 2020, Collins said of the administration's pandemic response: “We have not done nearly as well as we needed to.”

O Jogo (English: "The Game") was a Brazilian reality show Broadcast on Rede Globo between May 27 and July 29, 2003, on Tuesday nights. It was a Brazilian version of the FOX Television show, "Murder in Small Town X".
Premise.
The plot of the program focused of the murder of businessman Wagner Klein, director of Paes Brasil School, in the fictional city of Santo Antônio. Was one of the Candidate's for mayor of the city, Wagner was married with Professor of Biology Priscila Klein, a woman unhappy with her marriage with him, and had a son, Maurício Klein, mysterious young Man who despite relying on his fathers income, distanced himself from the family. After his mysterious murder, it was discovered that the director was also a man full of enemies - with at least 12 suspects who could have committed the crime.
The murder, committed on the Klein family's boat, was recorded by the murderer himself who, without showing his identity, proposed a game, describing 12 suspects - one among them as him/her - and asking a question: "Who am I?". To unravel the mystery, 12 wannabe investigators, entered the fictional city to solve the mystery and claim the cash reward. Each week, the investigators were sent out on varying missions around the town in order to discover clues to clear suspects. Additionally, the murderer would strike again, clearing suspects as well.
At the beginning of each episode, one investigator would be appointed as the Lead Investigator, who would have specific responsibilities and powers. The investigators would be split into teams by the Lead Investigator, and sent down different "leads". During the investigation, the team would be given a task by the killer to take out one of the innocent suspects for a chance to accumulate R$25,000 for every time they get the correct suspect for the day. Failing to do the task or giving the wrong answer would mean the money wasn't added to the total pot. 
A maximum potential was R$250,000 (Adjusted for 2020's value, R$652,764) for clearing all ten suspects correctly, however the team got two suspects wrong meaning the final pot was left at R$200,000 for solving the case.
At some point during the investigation days in each episode the killer would leave some form of message, consisting of maps with the two locations attached. Signaling the start of each episodes elimination, The "Final Investigation". Every investigator except the lead investigator could vote and the investigator with the most votes would be chosen as the first person to conduct the "Final Investigation". The Lead Investigator would then choose any investigator to be the second person for the "Final Investigation". The two chosen investigators pick from two envelopes to decide who will go to either of the two locations given. 
In the "Final Investigation"., the two selected investigators would be sent to two different remote locations completely alone, with their movements recorded only by a head-mounted camera and a flashlight, they also had to follow a map to where the "clue" would be located. One of the chosen investigators would discover an important clue that would help solve the mystery, whereas the other investigator would be eliminated from the show as "murdered by the killer".
The eliminated contestant would choose the Lead Investigator for the next episode, by means of a prerecorded "last will and testament".
The Investigators.
The following list are the contestants that took part in the show, in the order of Elimination.
The Suspects.
The Following list are the suspects that the investigators had to figure out who the murder was.
Winning Moment.
In the final event of the show, Both Breno and Elaine were the last two investigators left in the show. Breno who was the lead investigator chose Tadeu as the killer, while Elaine picked Maria. In the end both went off to their respected locations, in the end the killer was revealed to be Maria.
Her motive to murder was a follows; Maria had an affair with Wagner Klein, when her father found out about it, he committed suicide. As part of a confession in her final location at the chapel, she had been planning for the right time to not only murder the Klein family but also anyone from a Satanic sect who didn't agree to follow on her plans. Among the plans she has was to kidnap and kill Maurício Klein and Alice Erthal's son João Pedro. However the cops got to Maria and J escaped. But when cornered, Maria ended up committing suicide in the end. 
Elaine was then awarded the cash prize of R$200,000 Reais. (Adjusted to 2020's value is R$522,211)

Tango in Harlem

Tango in Harlem is an album by saxophonist Teddy Edwards recorded in 1995 and originally released on the French Verve/Gitanes label the following year.
Reception.
In his review for BBC Music Magazine, Chris Parker stated "In his most sympathetic recording situation for a while, and playing a judicious mix of standards and bluesy originals with a first class rhythm section, Teddy Edwards (who is 72 this month) has produced what is probably his finest album since "Together Again!!!!" and "Teddy's Ready!", the latter also featuring Billy Higgins. Edwards’s sound is elegant, deceptively easygoing and intensely melodic but is laced with enough post-bop astringency to lift him firmly out of the easy-listening category. On ballads such as ‘The Nearness of You’ and ‘Old Folks’, their momentum miraculously sustained through murderously slow tempos by excellent rhythm-section work, he savours every lingering note. On up-tempo, bustling pieces, his solos, while supremely logical, are imbued with his trademark relaxed swing. ... Overall, a superb performance from a mature master".

Margi Robertson

Margarita Anna Robertson ( Gladiadis, born 1953) is a New Zealand fashion designer and the founder and creative director of the New Zealand fashion line NOM*d. In the 2018 New Year Honours, she was appointed an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the fashion industry. She is credited with helping define what is known as "the New Zealand Look." In the words of the New Zealand Fashion Museum, "Margarita Robertson’s status as a national designer of significant cultural importance is recognised in public collections and by her inclusion in recent exhibitions, biographies and histories on New Zealand fashion." In 2011, Robertson's creations were featured in a single-artist exhibition held at the Eastern Southland Gallery, Gore, July 28–2 September.
Background.
Robertson was born in Clyde in 1953 and grew up in Dunedin. Her sister is Elisabeth Findlay, founder of Zambesi, another New Zealand fashion line. She opened her first boutique in Dunedin in 1975, establishing her current boutique Plume in 1978, and a second Plume in Christchurch in 1992. Her label NOM*d, founded in 1986, was shown at the inaugural New Zealand Fashion Week in 2001 and is regularly features as part of iD Dunedin Fashion Week.
Career.
Within New Zealand, Robertson is associated with Dunedin and its cultural heritage as the location of the alternative music movement known as Dunedin sound. The bohemian counter-culture dimension of the city has left an indelible mark on her fashion sense. Her label appeals to a broad cross-section of its inhabitants – from those who were part of that movement to young aspiring creatives, writers, artists, musicians and others, including the many students who attend University of Otago, which is located in this city. Her designs are also described as "enjoying a flourishing trade in Europe, the United States and Asia." In 2015, "i-D magazine"'s website devoted an editorial spread to "Dunedin's Black Brigade" that featured Robertson and a series of young local inhabitants.

Saguntum and Valencia order of battle

The Battle of Saguntum (25 October 1811) saw the Imperial French Army of Aragon under Marshal Louis Gabriel Suchet defend against a Spanish army led by Captain General Joaquín Blake. The Spanish attempt to raise the siege of the Sagunto Castle failed when the French, Italians, and Poles drove their troops off the battlefield in rout. The 20,000 French inflicted 6,000 casualties on their more numerous opponents, including many prisoners, while sustaining only about 1,000 casualties.
Suchet hoped to quickly seize Sagunto Castle, but the 2,600-man Spanish garrison repulsed two of his assaults with several hundred casualties. Blake hoped to force Suchet to retreat by cutting off his supplies. The guerillas inflicted two stinging defeats on the French-Allied forces, but ultimately failed to shake Suchet's resolve. Blake reluctantly ordered his army to relieve the siege, even though he was not confident in the ability of his soldiers to face Suchet's veterans. Blake heavily weighted his left wing while keeping his best troops in the weaker right wing. The Spanish left wing attacked the much weaker French right flank and was completely routed by French infantry and Italian cavalry. The Spanish right wing gave a much better account of itself, forcing Suchet to commit all his reserves before forcing it to withdraw. Eventually, the French cavalry put the whole Spanish army to rout. Their hopes of relief dashed, the garrison of Sagunto Castle quickly surrendered. The action took place during the Peninsular War, part of the Napoleonic Wars. Sagunto lies a short distance from the east coast of Spain, about north of Valencia, Spain.
The Siege of Valencia (3 November 1811 – 9 January 1812) saw Suchet's army envelop and besiege most of Blake's army in the city of Valencia. The 30,000 French troops compelled 16,000 Spanish soldiers to surrender at the conclusion of the siege, although another 7,000 Spaniards escaped from the trap. Suchet quickly converted Valencia into an important base of operations. Valencia, modern-day capital of the Valencian Community, is located on the east coast of Spain.
Blake army waited passively in a line of fortifications outside Valencia. Reinforced by 13,000 Franco-Italian troops, the bulk of Suchet's army marched around the Spanish left flank and rolled up Blake's lines. Another Imperial French division managed to break through the Spanish right flank. The right and left Imperial pincers closed around Valencia. Two-thirds of Blake's army retreated within the city while the remainder withdrew to the west. After an abortive attempt to break out, Blake surrendered after a two-month siege.

Boys Don't Cry is a 2010 novel by Malorie Blackman. The novel explores the experience of Dante as he discovers that he is the father of a child by his ex-girlfriend.
In "The Guardian", Mary Hoffman described the novel as "a good book and a great story." Hoffman says that "how Dante comes to terms with fatherhood and his responsibilities is genuinely moving, while staying on the right side of sentimentality." Nicholas Tucker in "The Independent" described the novel as, at times, "too much plot manipulation has crept into this story", while "The rest of this novel still shows her writing at its best, creating characters and a story which, once read, will not easily go away."

Ariston Bathhouse raid

The Ariston Bathhouse raid in 1903 was the first anti-gay police raid on an establishment located in New York City. It resulted in thirty-four arrests, sixteen charges of sodomy, and twelve trials, five of which possess transcripts.
Raid.
On February 21, 1903, at nine o’clock at night, two undercover officers entered the building of the Ariston Bathhouse. Their names were Thomas Phelan and Norman Fitzsimmons. Since the building had been under surveillance via insistence by the police, it is known that at least one police officer, Norman Fitzsimmons, had entered the establishment at least twice prior to the police raid. Twenty minutes after arrival, according to his court testimony, Phelan was approached sexually by a man named Walter Bennett. After Bennett turned down Fitzsimmons's request to join, on the basis of Bennett preferring “fat boy[s]”, they arranged to meet later at 2:30 a.m. Shortly afterward, two other undercover officers joined Phelan and Fitzsimmons. They spent some time observing the bathhouse to gather evidence to incriminate individual patrons, and witnessed multiple instances of anal and oral sex, which they later recounted at the trials.
At 1:45 a.m., a group of police officers entered the establishment and blocked the exits so that none of the seventy-eight men inside could escape. They went through the men and found the individuals who they possessed complaints against, and arrested thirty-four men. The rest were let go with a warning. The proprietor of the bathhouse, John Begley, was accused of keeping a disorderly house and was held in $2,000 bail. Of the men arrested, some were charged with liquor law violations and disorderly conduct, and at least sixteen were charged with sodomy. Twelve of those sixteen were sent to trial, and five trials have transcripts that survived and are viewable today. Of these five trials, three returned verdicts of guilty, one verdict of guilty with a recommendation to mercy, and a mistrial. However, two of the guilty verdicts were later appealed.
It is known that police had spent several weeks collecting evidence against men who entered the bathhouse, which they did in conjunction with the Society for the Prevention of Crime. They used this evidence to create two diagrams of the bathhouse, which were used in the trials that followed.
Trials.
In the trial of "People v. Kregel", the defense relied on the physical impossibility of sodomy. The defendant, Andrew Kregel, was a tailor who was married with five children. At his trial, Andrew Kregel was said to have entered the bathhouse around 1:00 a.m. where he was approached by a man named Charles Chamberlin. The prosecution continued to describe that Chamberlin had performed anal sex with Kregel, while another man, John Rogers, performed oral sex on Kregel. All three were arrested by police about an hour later. However, Kregel denied the testimony about the alleged sex acts, and maintained that he had never been to a Turkish bathhouse before and that he received the ticket to the bathhouse from a customer at his shop in exchange for fixing a coat.
At that point, Dr. Pierre A. Siegelstein was called by the defense attorney to the witness stand. He told prosecutors that he had testified in two prior sodomy trials, and that anal sex performed by two men standing up was physically impossible due to physiological reasons. A medical expert specializing in sex crime cases, William Travers Gibb, refuted this claim, and said that upright anal sex was feasible. Eventually, it was declared a mistrial and Kregel's bail was reduced from $2,000 to $750.
In "People v. Galbert", the defense attorney cited the “physical impossibility” and “mathematical impossibility” of the crime. An employee from the bathhouse was called as a witness, and said that the couches present in the room where Galbert was found were a little more than a foot high, and Charles LeBarbier, Galbert's attorney, suggested that the couches were too low to permit the accused crime to take place. Galbert was an architect for Carrere and Hastings, a prominent firm that lead the Beaux Arts movement. Because of this, John Carrere, an accomplished architect, was called to attest to Galbert's mental health along with four other character witnesses. When Galbert was found guilty, LaBarbier used his resistance against the police during his arrest as a testament to his manliness and masculinity.
In "People v. Schnittel", Arthur C. Butts, Micheal Schnittel's defense attorney, attempted to defend his client by providing evidence of Schnittel's heterosexuality. He was accused of performing oral sex on another man by police, as well as walking about the bathhouse wearing a sheet the same way that a woman might. He was also accused of having a venereal disease due to his face having broken out in large, blotchy patches of red. His defense claimed that Schnittel had entered the bathhouse in an effort to clear up the skin condition. Schnittel himself claimed that he had never been in the room where the alleged sex acts took place, and his defense attempted to cement his masculinity by pointing out his engagement ring. In the end, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged.
In "People v. Bennett", Walter Bennett's defense attorney also cited his client's heterosexuality and desire for women as proof that he was innocent. The police accused him of wearing a sheet as a woman might, as well as engaging in oral and anal sex with another man. To testify against this, two women and a minister who knew Bennett were called. One of the women, Catherine Bolton, said that she had known Bennett since he was fourteen years old and implied that she had been romantically involved with him at some point. The prosecuting attorney claimed that the feminine perspectives of the women and the minister were not a good indication of Bennett's character, and went on to imply that Bennett was not unlike the women himself.
In "People v. Casson", Theodore Casson denied the charge of sodomy placed against him, but did admit to being in the Turkish bath, where he was arrested. The officer who arrested him claimed to have arrested him shortly after the accused act took place, which caused a direct conflict of testimony. The jury returned a verdict of guilty with a recommendation to mercy.

Habis

Habis (from the Cynete language meaning fawn) is a legendary king of the Spanish region of Tartessos. The only source of the legend of Habis and his father Gargoris is the work "Epitome" by Justin, who copied it from the now lost work "Philippic Histories" by Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus.
History.
According to legend, Habis's story began when his mother was stung by a bee. Her father, Gargoris, the king of Tartessos, hurried to heal her. As he knelt to soften her wound with his mouth, a passion came over both, thus procreating the baby. Due to the shame of having committed incest, the king ordered the child to be abandoned on the prairies outside the kingdom. Eventually the boy was raised by the deer in there, acquiring deer features. He was later found and recognized as the true heir to the kingdom, and later accordingly named.

Swede Vejtasa

Stanley Winfield "Swede" Vejtasa (27 July 1914 – 23 January 2013) was a United States Navy career officer and World War II flying ace. During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, he was credited with downing seven Japanese aircraft in one mission, becoming an "ace in a day".
Early life.
Vejtasa was born at an isolated homestead in Montana on July 27, 1914. He attended Montana State College, before transferring to the University of Montana.
Military career.
He joined the Navy in 1937 and became a Naval Aviator on 13 July 1939. Commissioned an ensign in August, he was first assigned to Scouting Squadron Five (VS-5) aboard the aircraft carrier that same month, flying the Douglas SBD Dauntless.
World War II.
After the United States entered World War II, then Lieutenant (junior grade) Vejtasa attacked three Japanese "aircraft tenders or transports", scoring a direct hit on one of them "near Salamaua and Lae, New Guinea", on 10 March 1942, for which he was awarded his first Navy Cross.
During the Battle of the Coral Sea, he and several other dive bomber pilots sank the Japanese light aircraft carrier "Shōhō" on 7 May 1942. Walter Schindler, the staff gunnery officer and future vice admiral, filmed the day's strike as Vejtasa's rear gunner. The next day, while flying in defense of the U.S. task force, Vejtasa claimed three Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters shot down, despite flying a much slower but sturdy Dauntless dive bomber. For his actions during the battle, he was awarded his second Navy Cross.
Vejtasa was transferred to fighters, piloting the Grumman F4F Wildcat, and was assigned to the newly formed Fighting Squadron 10, under Lieutenant Commander James H. Flatley, aboard . During the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands, he was credited with downing seven enemy aircraft in one mission – first two Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers attacking , then five Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers targeting "Enterprise" – becoming an "ace in a day". Lieutenant Vejtasa was awarded his third Navy Cross for this achievement. Seventy years later, an attempt to upgrade this to the Medal of Honor was denied. He is the only World War II carrier pilot awarded the Navy Cross "for both dive bombing and aerial combat."
He left Flying Squadron 10 in May 1943 and returned to the United States to serve as a flight instructor at Naval Air Station Atlantic City. He saw no further combat. At the end of the war, his tally was 10.25 victories, including a quarter shared credit for a Kawanishi H6K "Mavis" flying boat on 13 November 1942.
Post-war.
Vejtasa remained in the Navy after the end of the war and served in the Korean War as air officer aboard from 1951 to 1953. He commanded the ammunition ship from July 1959 to August 1960 and the aircraft carrier from November 1962 to November 1963. He received the Legion of Merit for his work as Commander Fleet Air, Miramar, from 15 August 1965 to 7 June 1968. He retired on 1 July 1970 as a captain.
Personal life.
Vejtasa and his wife Irene had three children.
Vejtasa died on January 23, 2013. In accordance to his wishes, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.
Awards and decorations.
He was also awarded two Bronze Stars, the Meritorious Service Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal and was inducted into the Carrier Aviation Hall of Fame in 1987.
 
1st Navy Cross citation.
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Stanley Winfield Vejtasa, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Pilot of a carrier-based Navy Scouting Plane in Scouting Squadron FIVE (VS-5), attached to the U.S.S. YORKTOWN (CV-5), in action against enemy Japanese forces near Salamaua and Lae, New Guinea, on 10 March 1942. In the face of heavy anti-aircraft fire, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Vejtasa dived and skillfully attacked one of three Japanese aircraft tenders or transports and obtained a direct hit on one of the hostile vessels. By his superb airmanship and outstanding courage he contributed to the destruction of the three enemy ships and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
2nd Navy Cross citation.
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Gold Star in lieu of a Second Award of the Navy Cross to Lieutenant, Junior Grade Stanley Winfield Vejtasa, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Pilot of a carrier-based Navy Scouting Plane in Scouting Squadron FIVE (VS-5), attached to the U.S.S. YORKTOWN (CV-5), in action against enemy Japanese forces at Tulagi Harbor on 4 May 1942, and in the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 and 8 May 1942. On 4 May, Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Vejtasa participated in dive bombing attacks on the enemy in Tulagi Harbor which resulted in the sinking or damaging of at least eight enemy vessels. On 7 May, he took part in a dive bombing attack on an enemy carrier in the Coral Sea which resulted in the sinking of that vessel. On 8 May, while on anti-Torpedo Plane patrol, he engaged enemy bombing and Torpedo Planes heavily supported by fighters which attacked our forces. The attacks on 4 and 7 May were pressed home in the face of heavy anti-aircraft fire with no regard for personal safety. Lieutenant, Junior Grade, Vejtasa's conscientious devotion to duty and gallant self-command against formidable odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.
3rd Navy Cross citation.
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting a Second Gold Star in lieu of a Third Award of the Navy Cross to Lieutenant Stanley Winfield Vejtasa, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Pilot of a carrier-based Navy Fighter Plane and leader of a Combat Air patrol of four fighters of Fighting Squadron TEN (VF-10), attached to the U.S.S. ENTERPRISE (CV-6), during the engagement with enemy Japanese naval and air forces near the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October 1942. As great numbers of enemy dive bombers and Torpedo Planes launched a vicious attack upon his carrier, Lieutenant Vejtasa unhesitatingly challenged and shot down two Japanese dive bombers and then gallantly led his patrol in an attack on a group of enemy Torpedo Planes with such daring aggressiveness that the formation was completely broken and three of the hostile bombers jettisoned their torpedoes as they fled. Lieutenant Vejtasa then personally shot down five of the remaining Japanese planes, making a total of seven enemy aircraft destroyed in a single flight. His superb airmanship and indomitable fighting spirit were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

White Flags

The White Flags () are an active insurgent group in northern Iraq opposed to the Iraqi government, having taken part in the Iraqi Civil War's last phase and the ongoing Iraqi insurgency (2017–present).
Ideology.
The exact ideology and beliefs of the White Flags are disputed:
Organisation and tactics.
The White Flags are considered to be a terrorist organization by Iraqi officials. In late 2017, an Iraqi-Turkmen MP accused Kurdish leaders of supporting the group. This was denied by the Kurdistan Regional Government. The group's leader Hiwa Chor, a one-eyed militant in his early forties, was a former member of al-Qaeda in Iraq but disagreed with ISIL's ambitious Caliphate plans so left the organization with a Turkman militant from the Diyala Governorate. The group uses various guerilla tactics such as ambushes and utilizes IEDs. It also uses mortars and rockets. The group operates in and around Tuz Khurmatu, has launched frequent attacks on oil fields and routes in the area.

CISBOT

CISBOT (cast-iron sealing robot) is a cast iron pipe-repair robot that seals the joints in natural gas pipelines from the inside, thus extending their use for up to fifty years without unearthing the joints.
Background.
Many cast-iron pipes installed over a century ago have joints of jute sealed with lead that deteriorate over time and are often the causes of cast-iron pipe failure. Jute was an effective joint sealant when the pipes carried coal-based town gas, but natural gas, used since the 1950s in New York and the 1970s in the UK, dries out the jute. A fifty-year life expectancy of the new seal has been proven in studies by Cornell University.
Description.
CISBOT is in diameter, is long, weighs , and is deployed with a truck containing the control unit, which is attached to the robot with a tether for the power, communication, and control cables, as well as sealant tubing. It is capable of repairing pipe.
CISBOT is introduced into a pipeline through a hole and can repair the joints with an anaerobic sealant for a distance of while the pipe is still in operation. External repair without the robot would require the arranging of temporary gas supply to customers through tanks, purging the pipeline of gas, then digging up each joint, usually every , repairing the joint, and re-covering the pipeline. The cost of internal robotic repair is approximately 25% of manual resealing and 10% of total pipeline replacement.
The robot was developed by ULC Robotics of Hauppauge, New York with cooperation from Con Edison and National Grid and costs approximately $1 million. ULC announced the robot in 2015; however it has been in use since at least 2010 and by mid-2012 had sealed over 5000 joints.
CISBOT has been used in the United States in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Staten Island, Rhode Island, and Boston. In Europe, it has been used in London and Glasgow by SGN.
Operation.
A flange is first attached to the pipe, through which CISBOT drills an access hole. It then rolls into the pipe and propels itself on two wheels down the pipe. It can travel up to per minute. Upon reaching a joint, it rotates 360° within the pipe to apply the sealant, using its third perpendicular wheel. It drills holes into the joints through which it injects the sealant. It is controlled by two operators monitoring through six cameras. It is equipped with lights and other sensors.
In New York City, CISBOT has discovered foreign objects within gas pipelines, including a baseball and stiletto shoes. It found a 1939 newspaper under Boston's Berkeley Street.
In 2015 CISBOT received a "game changer" award from Robotics Business Review because of its significant improvement in the process used to fix pipe joints.

The Flinders News

The Flinders News is a weekly newspaper published in Port Pirie, South Australia, formed from the historic mergers of multiple Mid-North publications and representing a combined ancestry of 12 former publications. Its earliest constituent publication, the "Northern Mail", was first issued on 30 June 1876, and the newspaper has been published under its current title since 1989. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media.
History.
"The Flinders News" originated with the historical mergers of several struggling mid-northern newspapers in 1948, 1970, and 1977:
Northern Review.
The "Northern Review" was created in 1948 by the merger of:
Review-Times.
The "Review-Times" was created in 1970 by the merger of:
Review-Times-Record.
The "Review-Times-Record" was created in 1977 by the merger of:
In 1989, the title of the "Review-Times-Record" was changed to its current title, "The Flinders News". It was part of the Fairfax Media group.
Distribution.
"The Flinders News" is distributed throughout the mid-north region of South Australia, northern Yorke Peninsula, the Far North, Port Pirie, and Port Augusta, and had a claimed readership of 24,000. Like other Rural Press publications the newspaper is also available online.
Awards.
Recently, the "Flinders News" won an award at the nationwide Fairfax Regional Media Awards for best co-op as well as placing runner-up in best feature and sales team of the year.
Digitisation.
Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1911 to 1950, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service.

Discodermia calyx

Discodermia calyx is a species of bowl-shaped sponge that is found in shallow waters in central and southern Japan. The species is distributed by the central Kuroshio current and is therefore localized along this current. Like many other sponges, "D. calyx" are very porous. They use the pores in their outer walls to draw in water which they then expel, retaining the nutrients dissolved in the water to nourish themselves. To keep water flowing in and out, the flagella that line their pores beat in either direction. 
The toxin calyculin A, used in medical research, can be extracted from this species.
Taxonomy.
"Discodermia calyx" belongs to the Animalia family. Its phylum is "Porifera", which is characterizes it as a sponge. "D. calyx" belongs to the class demospongia and the order tetractinallida. The family that it belongs to is theonellida. Finally, the correct binomial nomenclature for this species of sponge is "Discodermia calyx", which indicates its genus and species. "D. calyx" has no colloquial name, as it is known primarily in scientific and medicinal contexts. 
Use in research.
"Discodermia calyx" is one of a few sponges that contain the molecule known as calyculin A. This well-studied toxin was discovered originally in "D. calyx." When it was first studied it was discovered to be a phosphatase inhibitor, it stops an enzyme that dephosphorylates proteins within the cell. Calyculin A was studied in an experiment that used breast cancer cells. The toxin extracted from this primitive species enhanced the phosphorylation of cyclin D1. This caused the degradation of cyclin D1, which leads to arrest in cell cycle progression in the breast cancer cells. This, among other studies established calyculin as a phosphatase inhibitor. This toxin, and therefore this species, among others with similar toxins, became increasingly studied and important in medicine, particularly relating to chemotherapy. In a later study, scientist concluded that the calyculin A, from "D. calyx," also blocks calcium influx by blocking non-selective ion channels in the cell.
Later research looked into "D. calyx" as a species to look at the natural mechanisms that can be used to regulate the toxicity of calyculin A. Scientist found regulation through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. These among other studies focus on regulation of the toxin as a characteristic of the sponge Discodermia Calyx because of its implications in the fight to cure cancer.

1936 State Line earthquake

The 1936 State Line earthquake (also referred to as the 1936 Milton-Freewater earthquake) struck at 23:08 Pacific time on July 15, 1936. The earthquake had an estimated magnitude of 5.8 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII "(Very strong)". The epicenter was near the Oregon/Washington state line approximately northwest of Milton-Freewater, Oregon and southwest of Walla Walla, Washington and was felt throughout the Pacific Northwest, including as far away as Bonners Ferry, Idaho near the Canadian border and by seismographs as far away as San Diego, California.
Geology.
Larger earthquakes like the 1936 State Line earthquake are not uncommon along the Olympic–Wallowa Lineament, a series of faults stretching from Port Angeles, Washington to the Wallowa Mountains in northeast Oregon. Another earthquake estimated near a magnitude 6 struck the Walla Walla valley in 1882. The earthquake occurred in the Touchet Ridge, a spur leading west off the Blue Mountains that is known as the Horse Heaven Hills west of the Wallula Gap. There is both the old fault along the ridge as well as a newer fault leading from the ridge into the valley.
To the north of the earthquake is the Hite Fault, which lies approximately parallel to the west slopes of the Blue Mountains in Walla Walla County. The Hite Fault is thought to be the boundary between the more stable North American craton to the east and accreted material to the west. While there is no evidence of a Quaternary earthquake event along the Hite Fault, the USGS and several Washington state agencies have run scenarios regarding a future earthquake on the fault.
There have been 66 earthquakes felt in the area since 1936. Most of these have had a magnitude below 4, though one event in November 1991 was 4.3.
Earthquake.
The ground near Milton-Freewater exhibited cracks over an area that was long by up to , one of which being long and wide in places. Near Umapine there were cracks in the ground up to wide that had water flowing out of them, demonstrating soil liquefaction. Some cracks were deep. Residents in Umapine reported being woken during the night.
Wells in Milton-Freewater saw in increase in water level and a creek near town, which had previously ran dry, began flowing immediately after the earthquake. Observers in Walla Walla noted rumbling noises immediately preceding the first shocks. At one point the ground dropped by . About 70% of headstones at a nearby cemetery were found to have been rotated clockwise.
Two small foreshocks were recorded in the three hours before the main shock.
Damage.
Severe damage was widespread throughout Milton-Freewater and Walla Walla. In Athena, people were forced to evacuate their homes due to large cracks found within their walls. Rocks were reported to have wandered into some intersections and two freight cars were shaken off the tracks at Blue Mountain Station in Dayton.
The shaking was reported as being strongest near State Line. Very strong shaking occurred in Milton-Freewater, breaking windows and collapsing chimneys that had been built longer than ten years previous to the earthquake. Up to $3,000 ($53,000 in 2018) in damage was done to canned goods as well as $8,500 ($151,000 in 2018) in damage to school buildings. A new home west of town was nearly destroyed, and extensive damage was dealt to two cement homes that had been built around 1916 about west of town. In Umapine a handful of homes were badly damaged. The grade school and high school, which were joined, were found to be separated by .
Chimneys on roofs collapsed in numerous locations, as far away as Waitsburg. Pendulum clocks stopped in Umatilla and plaster was found to have been cracked in Prosser.
Aftershocks.
Over 50 aftershocks were recorded intermittently until mid-November 1936. Several dozen were felt the night of the event in the immediate area, with only three of them reaching to Hermiston. These earthquakes occurred in both Washington and Oregon, owing to the close proximity of the main shock to the state line. Aftershocks measuring IV on the Mercalli scale were recorded in August, with the ones that struck in November being measured as III.

Spot delivery

Spot delivery (or spot financing) is a term used in the automobile industry that means delivering a vehicle to a buyer prior to financing on the vehicle being completed. Spot delivery is used by dealerships on the weekend or after bank hours to be able to deliver a vehicle when a final approval cannot be received from a bank. This method of delivery is regulated by many states in the U.S., and is sometimes referred to as a "Yo-Yo sale" or "Yo-Yo Financing."
During a spot delivery, many consumers believe that the deal is final when in fact it is not. Signed agreements allow the dealership the right to take the car back or renegotiate the agreement if it cannot obtain financing within a specific amount of time.

Høst &amp; Søn

Høst &amp; Søn, formerly Andr. Fred. Høst and Andr. Fred. Høst &amp; Søn, was a publishing house and bookshop founded in 1836 in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was acquired by Munkegaard in 1975 and has been part of Gyldendal since 1998. As of 2003, Høst &amp; Søn is no longer operated as an independent subsidiary but survives as a brand under Rosinante &amp; Co. that specializes in children's books and youth literature.
History.
The company was established on 15 April 1836 when Andreas Frederik Høst (1811-1897) opened a combined book and art shop at Gothersgade 49 in Copenhagen. In 1842, Høst was appointed to university book shop and by then he had commenced his activities as a publisher. Among his early publications were books by Hans Christian Ørsted and Adam Oehlenschläger.
The company was renamed Andr. Høst &amp; Søn when Høst's son Peter Chr. Muusfeldt Høst (1847-1900) became a partner on 1 January 1873. By then its activities also included import of books. Peter Christian Høst became the sole owner of the company on 1 July 1892. A department specializing in used books opened on 1 January 1883 under the name Skandinavisk Antikvariat. On 24 November that same year Høst's bookshop was appointed to court bookshop. In 1896 the company relocated to Bredgade 35.
Peter Chr. Høst's widow Marie Claire Høst (1854-1932) took over the operation of the company after his death on 25 February 1900. On 1 July 1901 she was appointed to English court bookseller. Their son Andreas Frederik Høst (1885-1912) became a partner on 1 January 1911 but died just 28 years old on 4 May the following year.
On 1 January 1917, Marie Claire Høst sold the company to Johannes Lind (1890-1935). Marie Høst initially kept Skandinavisk Antikvariat tbut sold it to Sigurd Wandel in July 1924 and Høst &amp; Søn then established a new bused bookshop. In 1934 the company acquired Koppels Forlag. Johannes Lind's widow Gerda Lind took over the company after his death on 23 February 1935. It is converted into an "aktieselskab" on 1 January 1936. Johannes and Gerda Lind's son Mogens C. Lind (1918-2000) was appointed to CEO in 1946.
The company changed its name to Høst &amp; Søns Forlag after the bookshop closed on 31 December 1975. In 1986, it was sold to Munkegaard. Joachim Malling, who already heading Hans Reitzels Forlag, another Munkegaard subsidiary, then became the CEO of both companies. The company initially moved to Dronningens Tværgade and later to Nørre Søgade. Erik C. Lindgren took over the management of the company after Malling was promoted to CEO of the entire Munkegaard Group.
In 1998 Høst &amp; Søns Forlag was acquired by Gyldendal along with the rest of Munkegaard Group. Høst &amp; Søn was discontinued as an independent subsidiary in 2003.
Today.
Høst &amp; Søn is no longer operated as an independent subsidiary but survives as a brand under Rosinante &amp; Co. that specializes in children's books and youth literature.

Raif Denktaş

Raif Denktaş (also known as Raif Rauf Denktaş) (January 26, 1951 – December 26, 1985) was a Turkish Cypriot composer, politician, academic, journalist and writer. He died after a controversial car accident where his car collided with a military vehicle.
Early life.
Raif Denktaş was born on January 26, 1951 in Nicosia to Aydın and Rauf Denktaş, the founder and the former President of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. He attended to the Köşklüçiftlik Primary School which was later renamed as Şehit Tuncer Primary School following the death of his primary school teacher during the 1963 intercommunal violence between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Before graduating from Türk Maarif Koleji in 1969, he studied a part of his secondary education in TED Ankara College and in Kadıköy Maarif College during his father's exile in Turkey.
Denktaş fought during the 1963 incidents at the age of 12. He was also on military service for the 22nd Squad as a high school student from 1968 to 1969. He returned to his squad temporarily in 1974 after the coup d'état organised by the Greek Junta and stayed until the completion of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus.
Academics.
Raif Denktaş received his bachelor's degree in public administration from the Middle East Technical University, followed by a master's degree in political science from the University of Oxford. Denktaş received an offer from the latter institution to complete his PhD in sociology of politics in 1982, however he opted to return to Cyprus and pursue a political career.
He taught in Eastern Mediterranean University from September 1985 to his death in December 1985.
Political career.
In the 1976 General Elections he was elected for the Federated Assembly as a National Unity Party MP. Even though he worked as the Secretary General, he resigned from the NUP in 1981 citing a difference in views. He founded the "Alliance of Patriotic Intelligentsia" in 1982 and the Social Democratic Party on December 30, 1982.
He represented his party at the Founding Parliament of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus as an MP, following the establishment of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983. He also changed his affiliation to the broader "Social Democracy Group" but had to reverse this move due to legal complications.
Denktaş was known as a strong critic to his father. Regardless of this, he was appointed by him as the Political Adviser to the President in 1985. He also opposed heavily to the government and the National Unity Party during the preparations of the constitution. As a Kemalist, he wrote many articles on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's ideas but fiercely supported independence over a possible annexation by Turkey.
He was also known for endorsing the Cyprus peace process. His visit to the southern part of the Cyprus in 1984 along with the Communal Liberation Party leader İsmail Bozkurt and the Secretary General of the Republican Turkish Party, Naci Talat Usar was reported as the first visit by Turkish Cypriots since their displacement in 1974. This visit was criticised heavily by the nationalists and the visitors were called as "traitors" by Birlik newspaper.
Musical career.
Raif Denktaş played the bass guitar for the school band of TED Ankara College where two of his compatriots were also playing. Upon his return to Cyprus, he joined Bayrak Kuartet in 1968. The band was supported by the army personnel and they practised at the basement of the headquarters of the 22nd Squad where Raif was deployed.
In 1969, was formed by Raif, Ferahzat Gürsoy, Erdinç Gündüz and Aydın Kalfaoğlu. Raif sang and played bass guitar for the band. Sıla 4 is regarded as the most influential music band which has shaped the Turkish Cypriot music, combining folk tunes and lyrics together and arranging them to the contemporary context.
Raif Denktaş composed many different songs including Gariban and Ayrılık which was not only popular in Cyprus, but also in Turkey.
Death.
During 1985, Raif Denktaş was subjected to many criticism and alleged defamation by both the Turkish and the Turkish Cypriot press. Many different news, composed of hoaxes were being published including claims that Raif was hiding Hüseyin Kocabaş, a Turkish assassin at his home or he was drug trafficking in Cyprus. National Intelligence Organization of Turkey later admitted that the stories were fabricated by their agents and the agents were fired. Raif's father Rauf, claimed that he was attacked for not agreeing to Turkey's political demands at that time.
Two weeks after the claims on drug trafficking were published, he sustained fatal injuries in a car crash near Cihangir on his way back from Famagusta after lecturing at the Eastern Mediterranean University on December 24, 1985. A military vehicle collided with the car Raif was driving.
He was moved to Ankara for treatment, but died on December 26, 1985.

Hans Crouse

Hans Michael Crouse (born September 15, 1998) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). He made his MLB debut in 2021.
Amateur career.
Crouse attended Dana Hills High School in Dana Point, California. As a senior, he struck out 99 batters in innings, posting a 7–3 win-loss record with a 0.88 earned run average (ERA). He committed to the University of Southern California to play college baseball. Crouse was considered one of the top prep prospects for the 2017 MLB Draft.
Professional career.
Texas Rangers.
Crouse was selected in the second round, 66th overall, by the Texas Rangers. He signed with the Rangers for a $1.45 million bonus and was then assigned to the AZL Rangers of the Rookie-level Arizona League, where he spent all of his first professional season, posting a 0.45 ERA with thirty strikeouts in twenty innings pitched along with an 0.70 WHIP. In 2018, he split time between the Spokane Indians of the Class A Short Season Northwest League and the Hickory Crawdads of the Class A South Atlantic League, compiling a combined 5–3 record and 2.47 ERA in 13 total starts between both teams.
Crouse was ranked as the #73 overall prospect in baseball by Baseball America in their preseason 2019 Top 100 list. Crouse was also ranked as the #85 overall prospect in baseball by MLB Pipeline in their preseason 2019 Top 100 list. Crouse was ranked as the #95 overall prospect in baseball by ESPN's Keith Law in his preseason 2019 Top 100 list.
Crouse was assigned back to Hickory for the 2019 season. Crouse produced a 6–1 record with a 4.41 ERA in innings in 2019. He was hampered by bone spurs in his right elbow throughout the season, which forced him to miss almost a month of action and required surgery following the season to remove. Crouse did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the Minor League Baseball season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Crouse opened the 2021 season with the Frisco RoughRiders of the Double-A Central, going 3–2 with a 3.35 ERA and 54 strikeouts over 51 innings.
Philadelphia Phillies.
On July 30, 2021, Crouse, Kyle Gibson, and Ian Kennedy were traded to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for Spencer Howard, Kevin Gowdy, and Josh Gessner. He split the remainder of the minor league season between the Reading Fightin Phils and the Lehigh Valley IronPigs.
On September 26, 2021, Crouse's contract was selected to the active roster to make his MLB debut that day versus the Pittsburgh Pirates.

Tribune East Tower

Tribune East Tower is an approved mixed use supertall tower to be built on the eastern edge of the Tribune Tower property, in the Streeterville area of Chicago. The building plans received final approval on May 8, 2020. Construction has begun (as of April 2021 the parking lot that previously occupied the site has been dug up and construction vehicles are present). When completed, the skyscraper would become the second-tallest in Chicago after Willis Tower.
History.
Tribune Tower sits on the southwest corner of property that includes four buildings and a surface parking lot. The other buildings are (clockwise) the four-story 1935 WGN Radio building, the eleven-story 1950 WGN-TV building, and the old "Chicago Tribune" printing plant, with the parking lot immediately east of all of these buildings. The Tower itself was declared an official Chicago landmark by the city in 1989.
In early September 2016, prospective buyers of the Tribune Tower property had redevelopment plans for the adjacent Pioneer Court that were at odds with local interests to protect views of Tribune Tower. Nonetheless, later that month, Tribune Media sold Tribune Tower and adjacent property totaling , including the surface parking lot, to the partnership. At the time of the purchase, the partnership of Los Angeles-based CIM Group and Chicago's Golub &amp; Co. sought input on how to redevelop the properties, although 42nd District Alderman Brendan Reilly noted that he would protect views of the Tower from the Michigan Avenue Bridge to the south and the Ogden Slip to the east.
By 2017, there were expectations that the partnership would plan a skyscraper tower to the east of Tribune Tower, even though no plans had been made public. In January 2018, plans emerged for a skyscraper on the northern portion of the parking lot on the east side of the Tribune Tower property. Plans called for 220 hotel rooms and 158 condominium units; the tower would be slightly shorter than the Trump International Hotel and Tower. The new skyscraper is being designed by Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture of Chicago. As an employee of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, Adrian Smith had designed Trump Tower and the Burj Khalifa, which became the tallest building in the world in 2010.
Originally envisioned at and standing nearly three times as tall as the 36-story Tribune Tower, the Tribune East Tower may still face opposition for obstructing views of the Tower, as well as "dwarfing" it from a historical perspective. Plans were officially announced for a tall 200-unit hotel, 439-apartment and 125-condominium building on April 16, 2018. These plans make the building shorter than the Willis Tower, the city's tallest. The proposal outlined several details, including funding earmarked for affordable housing and neighborhood opportunity as well as plans for the rest of the Tribune Tower property. At the time of its initial proposal, the planned building had no official name, but it was referred to as Tribune East by the media. On mid-October 2018, the Chicago Plan Commission approved the plans for the city's second tallest building. Chicago City Council approved the plans in an October 31 meeting. Minor revisions were unveiled on November 20, 2019, and on May 8, 2020, the project received final approval and construction is expected to begin in late 2021 or early 2022.

America Fore Building

The America Fore Building is a historic office building located at 844 N. Rush Street in the Near North Side neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. The building was built in 1923 for the America Fore group, a group of four insurance companies with shared leadership. In the early 20th century, commercial development north of the Chicago River was guided first by the Burnham Plan in 1909 and later by the North Central Business District Association, which commissioned a plan of the area in 1919. While the Association mainly focused on development along Michigan Avenue, it also made plans for the surrounding neighborhood, and the America Fore Building was built according to these plans. The building is twelve stories tall, only two higher than the Association's set limit for Michigan Avenue, and features a similar design with stone cladding and large showroom windows.
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 21, 2016.

Harley Quinn (TV series)

Harley Quinn is an American adult animated superhero television series based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Paul Dini and Bruce Timm. The series is written and executive produced by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker, and Dean Lorey and follows the misadventures of Harley Quinn and her friend Poison Ivy after leaving her boyfriend, the Joker. The show premiered on DC Universe to critical success on November 29, 2019, with critics praising its animation, humor, dark tone and voice acting.
The show's second season premiered on April 3, 2020.
On September 18, 2020, the series was officially renewed for a third season, along with the announcement that the show would move to HBO Max, following the restructuring of DC Universe.
Overview.
The series follows Harley Quinn's misadventures after breaking up with the Joker upon the realization that he does not love her. The first season focuses on Harley's attempts to prove herself as a competent villain in order to join the Legion of Doom, starting with the formation of her own crew consisting of Poison Ivy, Clayface, Doctor Psycho, King Shark, and Sy Borgman. When she finally achieves this goal, however, she inadvertently distances herself from her newfound friends and continues to face problems from the Joker, who cannot stand the idea of Harley being a successful supervillain without him. In the season one finale, the Joker manages to take over Gotham City, only to be defeated by Harley and her crew. In a final act of retaliation, he destroys the entire city, resulting in his and Batman's apparent deaths.
In the second season, Gotham has , allowing the newly-formed Injustice League — consisting of the Penguin, the Riddler, Mr. Freeze, Two-Face, and Bane — to take over the city's ruins. After they refuse to let Harley join them, she works with her crew to take them down one by one in order to claim Gotham for herself; in the process unwittingly inspiring Barbara Gordon to become Batgirl. Meanwhile, both the Joker and Batman are revealed to be alive; albeit with the former now sane and with no memory of his old self while the latter, unable to fight crime due to his injuries, names Batgirl his temporary replacement as Gotham's defender until he recovers. Following the Injustice League's defeat, Commissioner Gordon restores order to Gotham while Harley begins to develop feelings for Ivy. Concurrently, Doctor Psycho leaves the crew to exact revenge on Harley for under-appreciating him, and manages to take over Gotham with a Parademon army he obtained from Darkseid. To stop him, Harley joins forces with the Justice League, Gordon, and the Joker; reluctantly restoring the latter back to his former self in the process. Although Psycho is defeated in the end, he retaliates by revealing Harley and Ivy had sex right before the latter's wedding with Kite Man. Though Ivy and Kite Man attempt to continue on, Gordon, annoyed that he did not receive any recognition for saving Gotham, attempts to bust their wedding. Amidst the chaos, Kite Man realizes Ivy does not love him and breaks up with her. While escaping from the police together, Ivy finally admits her feelings for Harley.
Episodes.
Season 3.
According to Screen Rant, season 3 will not premiere until late 2021. An interview from creators Halpern and Schumacker stated that they were "optimistic" despite the shift from DC Universe to HBO Max and estimated late 2021 for season 3. Schumacker stated it was more difficult to produce, but it will be much simpler not having to create two seasons back to back. Halpern has stated in an interview with "Entertainment Weekly" that season 3 will explore Harley's reaction to a half healthy relationship with Ivy as well as focusing more on Ivy's backstory as the previous two seasons were mainly focused on Harley. Schumacker said that new writers from the LGBTQ+ community have been hired because of the direction of season 2 and that it is a priority to diversify the staff for season 3. Schumacker also revealed that Dean Lorey would no longer be available to return as showrunner for season 3 and would be replaced by new co-showrunners Chrissy Pietrosh and Jessica Goldstein alongside him and Justin Halpern. Composer Jefferson Friedman rumored there would be a musical episode coming. Friedman also stated that he wanted to refresh the music to give identity for each character. During an interview with "Deadline Hollywood" Schumacker stated that his desire was to open season 3 on "an actual Zoom, where the GCPD is just being berated by the city of Gotham for their ineptitude". In February 2021, series creator Patrick Schumacker announced that they had begun recording season 3.
Production.
Development.
On November 20, 2017, it was announced that the then-unnamed DC Universe had ordered 26 episodes of "Harley Quinn", a half-hour adult animated action-comedy series created and written by Justin Halpern, Patrick Schumacker and Dean Lorey.

Music.
Jefferson Friedman composed the music for the series. WaterTower Music released the soundtrack album for season 1 on August 21, 2020. The season 2 album was released on the same day.
LGBTQ representation.
In the Batman Multiverse, Harley Quinn (Dr. Harleen Quinzel) and Poison Ivy (Dr. Pamela Isley) started as friends. In the comics, Harley and Ivy even referred to each other as "Pam-A-Lamb." The writers took notice giving them moments of birthday kisses and taking showers together making their friendship more intimate. Harley Quinn's and Poison Ivy's romance in the "Batman" universe began in "Harley Quinn #1" when Harley whispers into Ivy's ear that the reason she "saves her" from the Joker is due to her romantic feelings for her. However, it wasn't until in 2013 the Amanda Connor and Jimmy Palmiotti "Harley Quinn" comic series where they're shown in a romantic coupling instead of friendship. Harley refers to Ivy as her "hot girlfriend" and the two are in an open relationship where they can pursue other partners while remaining dedicated to each other. In other parts of the "Batman" universe Harley and Ivy even got married in "Injustice 2".
In the May 15, 2020 episode "There's No Place to Go But Down" Harley Quinn saved her partner-in-crime, Poison Ivy; both kissed each other after they escaped from prison. The critic who reviewed the episode stated that Harley and Ivy's romance was a "slow burn", adding that this love affair could turn into a "more realistic exploration of how it feels to fall in love with a friend or to have an awkward hookup with a workmate." Another reviewer, Sophie Perry, writing for a lesbian lifestyle magazine, "Curve", noted how queerbaiting has long endured in LGBTQ+ representation, noting how She-Ra and Harley Quinn both had same-sex kisses, happening within stories which could have turned out to be "typical queerbaiting" but did not. In another episode, Clayface, a member of Harley's villain crew, was revealed as a gay character who had a crush on a male student.
In 2021, the series was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Comedy Series. The series was also nominated for several awards at Autostraddle’s 4th Annual Gay Emmys, in the categories of "Best Episode with LGBTQ+ Themes" for the episode "Something Borrowed," and "Outstanding Animated Series."
Release.
"Harley Quinn" premiered on DC Universe on November 29, 2019. On October 3, 2018, ahead of the annual New York Comic Con, a teaser trailer featuring Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy and Batman in Arkham was released. A full, uncensored trailer set to Joan Jett's cover of the theme song from "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" was released on July 20, 2019 to coincide with the panel at San Diego Comic-Con.
On December 8, 2019, the first episode was shown as a special presentation on TBS. Season 1 started airing on Syfy on May 3, 2020. The series has aired on Adult Swim in Canada, with new episodes airing a week after their American premiere. The series started airing on E4 in the United Kingdom and Ireland on May 7, 2020. The series debuted on HBO Max on August 1, 2020. In the United States, Adult Swim's Toonami programming block aired a marathon of the first season on the night of August 7–8, 2021.
An original short featuring Harley answering questions from fans was released online during DC FanDome in 2020.
Home media.
The first season was released on DVD on June 2, 2020 and the second season was released on February 16, 2021 by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. The first two seasons were also released on Blu-ray by Warner Archive Collection on February 16, 2021.
Digitally, the first two seasons are also available for digital purchase on Amazon Prime Video and iTunes.
Reception.
On Rotten Tomatoes, season 1 has an approval rating of 88% based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 8.25/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A strong voice cast and an even stronger grasp of what makes its titular antiheroine so beloved make "Harley Quinn" a violently delightful—and surprisingly insightful—addition to the DC animated universe." Season 2 has an approval rating of 100% based on 20 reviews with an average rating of 9/10, and a critical consensus stating, ""Harley Quinn" maintains its frenetic energy and humor while doubling down on the shenanigans and giving its titular anti-heroine even more room to play." On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 82 out of 100, based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating "universal acclaim".
Caroline Framke of "Variety" wrote: "The animation feels like that of a typical Saturday morning cartoon, but its acidic scripts and shocking bursts of gore reminds you that "Harley Quinn" is taking full advantage of airing on a streaming service without censors. [...] Sharp voice performances across the board from actors clearly relishing the chance to play in this world also prove too fun to resist. [...] Most importantly, Harley gets to be an entire person all her own, as heartbreakingly naive as she is wickedly strange and funny."
Robyn Bahr of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote: "It's one of the best surprises of the year. [...] 13 zippy, violent and irreverent half-hour episodes. [...] The writing is frequently uproarious, chock full of Millennial nostalgia and cerebral gallows humor (the former may be low-hanging, rapidly-perishable fruit, but at least the show knows how to embrace its audience)."

Walles T. Edmondson

Walles Thomas Edmondson (April 24, 1916 – January 10, 2000), also known as "Tommy" amongst his peers, was a prominent professor of zoology at the University of Washington. Edmondson was also leading American limnoecologist and writer, whose research focused on the causation and effects of eutrophication by plankton and his early work on rotifer taxonomy from Hispaniola, the Himalayas and lakes across the United States.
Edmondson won the Eminent Ecologist Award in 1983 from the Ecological Society of America.
Personal life.
Edmondson was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he would spend much of his youth at Lake Michigan learning about its biology. By 1938, Edmonson completed his B.Sc. from Yale University with eight scientific paper publications, one of which was in the journal "Science". Edmondson was known for his unconventional thought process and used many disciplines for his research, much of which included: systematics, fixation methods, and substrate effects. While at Yale, Edmondson did his Ph.D. with G. Evelyn Hutchinson and he also studied at the University of Wisconsin and Trout Lake under Chancey Juday.
At Wisconsin, Edmondson would meet Yvette Hardman, who would later become a close colleague and later on become his wife. The two got married in 1941 in Dwight Chapel, New Haven. This was hours after Edmondson completed his preliminary exams for his Ph.D. Edmondson became an oceanographer for the US Navy to aid with the war effort. In 1949, Edmondson and Hardman moved to Washington, where Edmondson would become a professor and teach limnology. In the 1950s, while in Seattle, Edmondson convinced the public they could implement solution to help clean Lake Washington leading to a large infusion of funds by the city of Seattle that was used to restore the lake. On his birthday in 1973 Edmondson was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. In 1980, the Societas Internationalis Limnologiae honored Edmondson with their highest honor, the Naumann-Thienemann Medal. His nomination as an eminent ecologist to the Ecological Society of America was written by G. Evelyn Hutchinson in 1984. In 2009, the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO) honored Edmondson by renaming an award for distinguished service to the Tommy and Yvette Edmondson Distinguished Service Award which recognizes "members who have displayed exceptional efforts that support the professional goals and enhance the stature of ASLO."

Capitol Beach Lake

Capitol Beach Lake (also known as Salt Lake) is a private lake in west Lincoln, Nebraska. The lake is managed by the Capitol Beach Community Association.
Description.
Capitol Beach Lake is located roughly three miles west of Downtown Lincoln and is surrounded by permanent residences as well as summer homes and rental properties. From the lake, the Capitol Building can be clearly seen as well as the skyline of Downtown Lincoln. Summertime activities at the lake include swimming, boating, sailing, fishing, water-skiing, and jet skiing.
Wildlife in the area includes blue herons, waterfowl, minks, pheasants, deer, and foxes. This fauna is supported both by the lake and the Saline Wetland Park, a public park managed jointly by the Capitol Beach Community Association and the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District. While there is no public beach access to the lake itself, the Saline Wetland Park features nature trails which are open to the public allowing for observation of these species.
History.
Saline wetlands before settlement.
Prior to the settlement of Lincoln, the land was home to numerous saline wetlands. These wetlands were supported by Salt Creek, a tributary of the Platte.Approaching Lincoln from the east, the first remarkable object that meets the eye of the stranger is a succession of what appears to be several beautiful lakes extending along the lines of Salt Creek to the northward and westward of the town, the nearest a mile distant. As their crystal surfaces glisten like molten silver in the sunlight the illusion is complete, and the most critical landscape painter would be deceived as to their character. But there is no water enclosed in their grassy banks . . .These apparent lakes are the Salt Basins of Lancaster County, in themselves natural curiosities well worthy of a long journey to visit them. The floor of these basins is hard clay, smooth and level as a brick-yard and polished as that of a Hollander’s kitchen. They are covered with a white layer of crystallized salt, wonderfully pure . . . Intersecting these salt floors are little streams of salty water, so strongly impregnated that it will abrade the tongue and lips when tasted.Upon the west side of Salt Creek the whole surface of the soil for two or three miles around the basins is covered with salt . . . Salt Creek itself is, as the name implies, a briny stream, and when the vicinity of the basins shall become a fashionable watering place, salt water baths will be indulged in without danger from hungry sharks or receding water.—"Nebraska Commonwealth" (Lincoln), September 7, 1867These wetlands were an important part of the ecosystem, bringing both wildlife and people to the area as a source of salt.As we viewed the land upon which now stands this great busy city, we had the exciting pleasure of seeing for the first time a large drove of beautiful antelope, cantering across the prairie about where the government square is (9th and O streets). We forded Salt Creek, just by the junction of Oak Creek, and what a struggle we had in making our way through the tall sunflowers between the ford and the basin. There was something enchanting about the scene that met our eyes. The fresh breeze sweeping over the salt basins reminded us of the morning breezes at the ocean beach.—W. W. Cox, 1888, describing the Lincoln landscape of July 1861The area which would later be known as Capitol Beach Lake was the largest of these salt basins and the confluence of several streams.The Great Basin [Capitol Beach Lake] covers an area of about 400 acres. The brine issues from a large number of places all over the surface, but in small quantities. All the salt water that comes to the surface from this basin unites in one stream, and we estimate the entire amount of water that flowed from this basin at from six to eight gallons per minute. The second salt basin lies between Oak and Salt creeks and covers an area of two hundred acres. The third basin is on Little Salt Creek, called Kenosha Basin, and covers two hundred acres. Numerous small basins occur on Middle Creek, which occupy in all about six hundred acres. Between Middle and Salt creeks are several small basins, covering 40 or 50 acres. From the surface of all these basins more or less springs ooze out.—F. V. Hayden, "First Annual Report of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories, Embracing Nebraska", 1867
Settlement period.
Prior to being chosen as the site of the Nebraska State Capitol, the area immediately surrounding the Salt Lake was populated only by the small village of Lancaster, which had a total population of thirty individuals. Most of these residents were involved in salt gathering. Proposed salt production capabilities played a role, along with regional politics, in the selection of Lancaster as the state capitol, with "The Nebraska Commonwealth", a newspaper which strongly supported the selection of Lancaster for the state capital, arguing that salt gathering provided such a business opportunity that "a town of great commercial importance is bound to be located on Salt Creek."
Salt production soared early on, with one company producing 125,000 pounds of salt in 1866 alone. However, it was believed that the salt industry would only be truly viable if a "mother lode" were found. Beginning in 1869, several wells were drilled to find an underground source of salt, all of which were unsuccessful. The salinity of Salt Creek is caused by ancient shale from the Cretaceous period, when the area was covered by ocean. Salt Creek, unlike most rivers in Nebraska, flows northeast and the tributaries which provide its salinity lie roughly thirteen miles northeast of Lincoln. Once it was realized that Salt Lake and Salt Creek did not contain a "mother lode," Lincoln began expanding eastward toward freshwater sources and away from the frequently-flooding Salt Creek.
In 1895, entrepreneurs diked the east end of the Salt Lake basin and diverted nearby Oak Creek into it. This altered the basin from an ephemeral wetland to a permanent saltwater lake. The lake was marketed as a resort with steamboat excursions, pavilions, bathhouses, and restaurants. The area was named "Burlington Beach" because of the Burlington Railroad line which carried passengers from Lincoln to the beach.
20th century to present.
By 1906, the original owners had sold the park due to dwindling visitors caused by a leak in the dike which had depleted the lake of its water. The sale had resulted in a new name for the lake, Capital Beach, which later became Capitol Beach. Capitol Beach changed hands several times. The city of Lincoln considered, but ultimately decided against, buying the property and incorporating it as a public park. The "Lincoln State Journal" chastised the city for their decision: Anyone with a spark of imagination cannot help viewing with enthusiasm the prospect of Capital Beach as a part of the city's park system. Here is Lincoln in the midst of a level plain, without rugged scenery and without a river. It seems like a special providence that at its very gates there should be a lake a mile long and a mile wide which could be made into a free vacation resort for the entire city. This lake, surrounded by trees and walks and drives, as it would be, and with ample park space on all sides is undoubtedly the city's greatest potential natural asset.—"Lincoln State Journal", August 2, 1915Until 1958, Capitol Beach operated as a privately owned amusement park, featuring a saltwater pool and dance hall. However, Lincoln had begun to see wetlands as a threat due to fear that they were breeding grounds for mosquitos. In a process that also resulted in the destruction of a majority of Lincoln's natural saline wetlands, Salt Lake was drained in 1958 so that Interstate 80 could pass through it. Portions of the lake were refilled using water pumped from Oak Creek, resulting in Capitol Beach Lake and Oak Lake.
In the 1990s, the Lower Platte South Natural Resources District began restoring elements of the saline wetlands which had previously dominated the area. This area, the Saline Wetlands Nature Center, is located east of Capitol Beach and is open to the public as a place to view now-rare saline wetlands and the animal and plant species which live in them.

Plot.
The play revolves around Helen, a recently hired scrub-woman, at the American Biological Association Development for the Advancement of Brain Analysis. During the course of her work, Helen learns the plight of an imprisoned intelligent dolphin that is being harshly studied by scientists. Helen begins to interact with the dolphin by feeding it and playing it music. Soon the dolphin begins to talk, but to no one but her. After overhearing of a final experiment that would leave the dolphin dead, Helen attempts to rescue the dolphin in a laundry hamper, but is unable to and the dolphin is vivisected and euthanized. 
"The Shape of Water" controversy.
In February 2018, David Zindel, the son of Paul Zindel, brought a plagiarism lawsuit against the makers of the film "The Shape of Water", alleging that its plot about a romance between a cleaning woman and a mysterious river creature was lifted directly from "Let Me Hear You Whisper". The film contains numerous plot elements that "include the play and the movie's basic story of the lonely janitor who works at a scientific laboratory during the Cold War, forms a loving bond with a captive aquatic creature and hatches a plan to liberate it."
Fox Searchlight Pictures studio as well as the makers of the film have denied that the work was at all derived from the play. Guillermo del Toro, the film's director, has claimed in an interview that the story came from a conversation with the novelist Daniel Kraus who is an associate producer of the film.

Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth

The Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth (Czech: "Kuratorium pro výchovu mládeže") was an organization in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia that provided athletic and cultural activities for youth ages ten to 18. Though created at the impetus of officials in the German-backed Protectorate government, it evolved to promote a distinctive form of "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism that was viewed with concern by some quarters of the Nazi Party. Following World War II, it was banned as a fascist organization and its principal leaders put on trial. 
History.
The Board of Trustees for the Education of Youth (or Kuratorium) was established in 1941 partly on the initiative of Colonel Emanuel Moravec to provide athletic and cultural activities for Czech youth between the ages of ten to 18. Many Kuratorium leaders were functionaries or supporters of the fascist "Vlajka" and Livia Rothkirchen has characterized its programming as an effort at Nazi indoctrination. 
However, Tara Zahra has noted that at the group's camping trips and other retreats for Czech boys and girls a special focus was made in celebrating Czech culture, with "Sicherheitsdienst" informants reporting to the German authorities that a kind-of "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism was being organically developed by the Kuratorium. 
Moravec was chair of the Kuratorium throughout its existence, while the organization was operationally managed by the Czech physician František Teuner.
Following World War II, the Beneš decrees proscribed the Kuratorium as a "fascist organization". In 1947, leaders of the Kuratorium were tried over their involvement in the organization, resulting in the conviction of Teuner and seven others: Eduard Chalupa, Jan Svoboda, Josef Victorin, Karel Žalud, Jiri Málek, Vaclav Krigar, Jaroslav Krigar, and Karel Mihaliče.
Activities.
According to a 1944 report in "The Guardian", the Kuratorium was then putting on "180 theatrical shows a week. In Prague alone its concerts, films, and exhibitions are visited by 13,000 children every day. It has arranged 13 great sports meetings in which 30,000 boys and girls took part. It has taught 80,000 children to swim. Some 200,000 have actively participated in its 'Art for Youth' competition, and 20,000 have been entertained at free holiday camps".
The Kuratorium's nationalist-oriented programming reached a zenith in the summer of 1944 when the "Week of Czech Youth" was staged in Prague, activities during which included thousands of Kuratorium participants attired in Czech national costume singing traditional Czech songs. Observers from the Hitler Youth came to the conclusion that Kuratorium activities had essentially become nothing more than a continuation of the banned Sokol movement and were concerned that "Reich-loyal" Czech nationalism would transform into a dangerous "double-edged sword". On the one hand, the existence of the Kuratorium showcased Germany's supposed tolerance for Czech institutions and helped educate Czech youth towards an anti-communist worldview, however, on the other hand it severely undermined the ultimate goal of Germanizing the population of the Czech lands.

William Whateley (barrister)

William Whateley (2 November 1794 – 15 November 1862) was an English barrister. He was noted as a supporter of the Conservative Party and the Church of England.
Life.
He was born in Birmingham, the second son of William Whateley, a solicitor from Birmingham and Handsworth, and his wife, Mary. The solicitor and coroner, John Welchman Whateley (1792–1874) was his elder brother. His youngest sister, Caroline, married James Traill. A George Whateley, of Waterloo Street, Birmingham, appearing in 1846 before a parliamentary committee on the voting system, referred to "Mr. William Whateley of the Oxford circuit" as his brother.
In November 1813, aged 19, Whateley was admitted to Lincoln's Inn. He matriculated at New College, Oxford in 1815 aged 21, graduating B.A. in 1820, M.A. in 1825. He was called to the bar at the Inner Temple in 1825, and then went the Oxford circuit. In 1826 he represented one of the candidates in the parliamentary election, and was noted there by John Marriott Davenport for his "platitudes and wit". He became Leader of the Oxford circuit. In 1841, he became a bencher of the Inner Temple, and a Queen's Counsel.
In 1847, Whateley stood as a Conservative parliamentary candidate, in , but was defeated by John Twizell Wawn, the Liberal. Again, in the 1852 United Kingdom general election, he stood as the Conservative candidate for , but was unsuccessful against two Whigs, Thomas Phinn and George Treweeke Scobell.
As Treasurer of the Inner Temple, Whateley gave evidence in 1854 to a parliamentary committee looking into the Inns of Court. Asked about the importance of Latin and Greek for barristers, he stated "I believe that it is of great importance to the Profession to make it a gentleman's profession, and to make its foundation a liberal education." He was recorder of Shrewsbury, and at times sat as a judge in assize courts.
Whateley died on 15 November 1862, at Park Street, Westminster, aged 68. His library was sold by Puttick &amp; Simpson, over four days in 1863.
Family.
Whateley married in 1834 Elizabeth Martha Nares, daughter of the Rev. Edward Nares, as her second husband; she had previously been married to the Rev. Lord George Henry Spencer-Churchill (1796–1828), son of the George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough. He was appointed (1841) one of those superintending the repair of Blenheim Palace, under an act of parliament.
The Whateley family solicitors' business, which had become the largest in Birmingham, was sold in 1873 by John Whateley, brother to George, to Robert Harding Milward (1837–1903).

Gurio Lamanna

Gurio Lamanna (also incorrectly called Gurlamanna) is a doline shaped like a coat of arms located in the Murge plateau and falling into Gravina in Puglia's territory, on the border with Altamura, Apulia, southern Italy. It is "one of the largest karst landforms of the Murge plateau" and it is located very close to other two dolines, namely Pulicchio di Gravina and Tre Paduli. Depending on the type of geomorphologic classification employed and the author who suggested it, the karst landform can be defined either a doline or a "karst basin" (). It is traditionally called "karst basin", following the suggestion of Carmelo Colamonico, who first studied the doline and saw in its large size and shallow depth a good reason to distinguish it from a normal doline. The definition of "karst basin", used by Carmelo Colamonico, has been introduced by Renato Biasutti. Carmelo Colamonico stated that Gurio Lamanna is "one of the best examples of karst basin in the Murge plateau".
Characteristics and dimensions.
The doline has an external perimeter of over , an average length of ca. and a maximum depth of . It covers an area of . Its walls have a low steepness compared to the nearby doline Pulicchio di Gravina. The bottom of the doline is flat "like a table"; such a flat expanse of land is very uncommon in the barren and hilly landscape of the Murge region. From this point of view, it may be likened to another large "karst basin", that is the expanse of Pescariello (Altamura), far wider and similarly karst.
The doline includes a sinkhole, into which part of the rainwater collected in its drainage basin flows out.
The whole flat area contains a deep layer of fertile soil, L'intera area piatta contiene un notevole strato di terreno fertile, consequence of the millenary erosion and which is successfully cultivated together with the nearby doline Tre Paduli. Also because of this, the area is different from the stony, arid and difficult to grow Murge region.
During the storms, the water in the doline reaches a relatively high level. This water flows out partly via the sinkhole partly via the porous limestone external walls. The water is absorbed in a very short time, usually a few hours. Water stagnates longer in the central area, which is also the lowest. In this central area, at the time of Carmelo Colamonico (1917), there was a tree and a pit for rainwater, while today there is an open tank used for rainwater.
Close to the doline are the ruins of a small XX century primary school both for children and adults.
History.
The doline (or "karst basin") was practically unknown among scientists and scholars until the first study published by Carmelo Colamonico in 1917. Previously it had been cited only by F. Virgilio (1900), who called it just "Gurio".
Etymology.
Carmelo Colamonico was the first person who called it with its name. He noticed that on the maps of the Italian geographic institute Istituto Geografico Militare of that time the area, comprising a cluster of buildings nearby, was just named "Masseria Crocetta", but its real name instead was "Masseria Gurio Lamanna". Carmelo Colamonico identified the real nome of the area ("Masseria Gurio Lamanna") and first used the term "Gurio Lamanna" to refer to the doline. As a proof of the correctness of Carmelo Colamonico's intuition, the word "gurio" is used in the Murge region to denote a large and flat sinkhole collecting a large amount of rainwater.
Origin and evolution.
The origin of the karst basin Gurio Lamanna can be explained with karst processes. The water coming from the relative drainage basin has slowly but constantly eroded (according to the usual double action - chemical and mechanical - of rainwater, typical of karst phenomena) the area, leading to the formation of the wide flat area full of fertile soil that is visible today.
Carmelo Colamonico hypothesized that, initially, there may have been a ditch in direction NW-SE caused by tectonic phenomena. Nevertheless, he noticed that today's dimensions would have never been reached if there had not been the double action of rainwater coming from such a large drainage basin (karst).
Rainwater mainly comes from two lamas, one located NW and the other NE. Both of them contribute to the erosion phenomenon, although the NW lama probably contributed (and still contributes) more than the NE lama. The erosion occurred (and still occurs) mainly in the northern direction in the region between the two lamas.

Lala Kamlapat Singhania

Lala Kamlapat Singhania (7 November 1884 – 31 May 1937) was an Indian industrialist, who founded the J. K. Organisation, one of India's largest conglomerate company. He was born to a Marwari Bania family in Kanpur, then part of the North-Western Provinces in British Raj.
He was the founder of several companies which came under the umbrella of JK Organization. The first major business set up by him was a cotton mill with the name of Juggilal Kamlapat Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills in 1921 which laid the foundation for JK Organisation.
Early life.
Kamlapat Singhania was born to Juggilal and Chandribai Singhania on 7 November 1884 in Kanpur. He was born into an occupational community of merchants, bankers, money-lenders, traders and dealers. His father was a successful businessman and belonged to the Singhania family of Singhana.
He joined the family business and assisted his father in expanding the business from traditional money-lending operations to trading in areas such as cotton, pulses and sugar cane. In 1918, the business was split between Kamlapat and his brothers – Banke Bihari and Radha Kishan. In the split Kamlapat received the Kanpur family house along with some cash.
Business career.
Kamlapat decided to start a cotton mill as opposed to being selling agents for established mills, as the Singhanias had been until then. Kamlapat secured a loan with the aim of setting up a cotton mill. Along with his father's contribution he established Juggilal Kamlapat Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills in 1921. JK Cotton Spinning &amp; Weaving Mills produced cotton cloth and yarn and was a successful venture.
He went on to set up several mills – Kamla Ice Factory in 1921, JK Oil Mills in 1924, JK Hosiery Factory in 1929, JK Jute Mills in 1931, MP Sugar Mills in 1932, JK Cotton Manufacturers Ltd in 1933 and JK Iron &amp; Steel Co Ltd in 1934. Kamlapat constructed a new building - Kamla Tower - across street from the family's Kanpur residence in 1934. Kamla Tower became the headquarters of Kamlapat's expanding organization and housed the offices for various companies he founded. The building was inspired by the design features of Big Ben. It is still operational and serves as the headquarters of JK Cement.
Later life and death.
In 1935, Kamlapat and his family moved from Kanpur residence to a newly constructed 20-acre bungalow near the Ganges called Ganga Kutir (Ganga Cottage). He also purchased a second property from an Englishman, which was named Kamla Retreat. Kamlapat died in 1937 and was survived by his sons – Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat.
Family history.
As per records of JK Temple Kanpur, Vinodi Das Singhania left his home in Singhana – a little town in the Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan – in 1775. He resettled in Farrukhabad, a small business town near Kanpur. He started off as a Banker and diversified into trading. This was the time when East India Company was entering India. His sons – Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas – later joined the family business and opened branch offices in Kanpur, Kolkata, Varanasi and Mirzapur.
After Ramsukhdas and Sarbsukhdas, the business was passed on to Ramsukhdas' son, Sewaram. Baldeodas took over the reins of the business along with his brother Munnalal from his father Sewaram. During this time the family also earned the royal title of 'Rajah Sahib'. Baldeodas had six sons and among them was Juggilal who took over the family business and played an important role in expanding and diversifying the business from bankers and traders to industrialists. In 1905, Juggilal and his family shifted to their Kanpur house after a division in the family business which then owned two flour mills — the Ganges Flour Mill and Cawnpore Flour Mill — apart from being the sole selling agents for Elgin Mills, Cawnpore Cotton Mills and Victoria Mills. The division created two new business units – Baldeodas-Kedarnath and Baijnath-Juggilal.
Personal life.
Kamlapat married Rampyari Devi and they had three daughters and three sons: Padampat, Kailashpat and Lakshmipat Singhania.
Legacy.
JK Organisation founded by Kamlapat is one of the largest conglomerates in India today, with multiple million and billion dollar companies under its belt. Several of these companies are listed publicly and have market capitalization in upwards of billion dollars. Some of the publicly listed companies are JK Tyre, JK Cement, JK Lakshmi Cement, JK Paper, Jaykay Enterprises, JK Sugar, JK Agri Genetics (JK Seeds) and JK Dairy (Umang Dairies). Privately held companies of the group are Raymond Group, J.K. Ansell, JK Technosoft, JK Fenner, Global Strategic Technologies and Dwarkesh Energy.
Kamlapat founded the Merchants' Chamber of Uttar Pradesh in 1932. Kamla Nagar in Kanpur — a township for JK employees – is named after Kamlapat Singhania. A number of institutions founded by members of Singhania family bears his name. Some of them are LK Singhania Education Centre at Gotan, JK Lakshmipat University, JK Institute of Radiology and Cancer Research at Kanpur, Lala Kamlapat Memorial Hospital at Kanpur, JK Institute of Applied Physics and Technology (University of Allahabad) and JK Institute of Sociology and Human Relations (University of Lucknow). A commemorative stamp was issued in 2010 by the Indian government honoring Lala Kamlapat Singhania.

JurisTech (Juris Technologies Sdn Bhd) is a Malaysian Financial technology company that serves banks in Malaysia with their predictive artificial intelligence system debt collection systems, loan origination systems, credit scoring systems, conveyancing and loan documentation systems.
JurisTech started off in 1997, during the Asian Financial Crisis, offering data mining and analytical tools that might help banks generate more sales. However, the company's initial offering of data mining services was not very popular, due to the rising bad debt during that period. The company then started offering credit management and litigation software. Their debt recovery software solution was a success, which resulted in JurisTech becoming an MSC Malaysia company in 2003.
In 2014, JurisTech was selected at the New York City International Selection Panel to be a part of the Endeavor (non-profit) network.
JurisTech has also been used as an example of "agile responsiveness" in Chris Zook and James Allen's book "The Founder's Mentality" in 2016.
In 2019, JurisTech was recognized by The Star (Malaysia) for best innovation and best use of technology.

Thomas Forrest Cotton

Thomas Forrest Cotton FRCP (4 November 1884 – 26 July 1965) was a Canadian cardiologist. He introduced electrocardiography to Canada and England and was the first to recognise the relationship between finger clubbing in adults with acquired structural heart disease and infective endocarditis. His paper on clubbing in endocarditis is considered by cardiologists as a classic.
Early life and family.
Thomas Cotton was born on 4 November 1884 in Cowansville, Quebec, to Cedric and Harriet C. Cotton. Cedric was a small-town physician. After completing his early medical education at McGill University, Cotton travelled to Europe to do house jobs. There, he worked with the big names of the time, Friedrich Kraus and Georg Nicolai, co-authors of the first textbook of electrocardiography, and later, with Friedrich von Muller in Munich and Karel Wenckebach in Vienna. He then spent a short time in postgraduate training in the United States before moving to University College Hospital, London, in 1913, where he worked with Sir Thomas Lewis.
In 1928, Cotton married Dr. Mary (Molly) Marshall, then a clinical assistant at the National Heart Hospital. They had no children.
Cardiology career.
Despite the age difference and distance between the two, Sir William Osler supported Cotton's postgraduate activities in England and abroad. Cotton later wrote, "the gates were opened wide for me to enter; a letter to Lewis from William Osler was all that was required to make life seem at its best".
Cotton briefly returned to Montreal General Hospital, where, in 1913, with the assistance of Osler's influence and financial contributions, Cotton was able to persuade the hospital to purchase an electrocardiograph. Cotton, as a result, became Canada's first electrocardiographer. 
At the onset of the First World War, Cotton enlisted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and re-joined Lewis at the Military Hospital, Hampstead, which had been established to carry out research into heart diseases in soldiers. It was at Hampstead that his path crossed with William Osler, Mackenzie, Clifford Allbutt, Caler, Meakins, Parkinson and Drury. In 1913 and 1917, he published ten papers in "Heart", eight of which were co-authored with Lewis.
During his assignment in 1917 at the Sobraon Military Heart Hospital in Colchester, England, Cotton became interested in finger clubbing. He found that clubbing of fingers in adults known to have structural heart disease was a common clinical finding in infective endocarditis. His paper on clubbing in endocarditis is considered by cardiologists as a classic. Following postmortem information on men with "acquired structural heart disease" and clubbing, Cotton stated that although clubbing was not "a conclusive sign of infection, it is nevertheless one of the most valuable signs we possess in coming to a correct diagnosis". As a result, he was the first to recognize clubbing of the fingers as a sign of infective endocarditis.
In 1922, he was one of four men who founded the Cardiac Club in London.
Death and legacy.
Cotton was an active member of the Osler Club of London. He had prospered from Canadian investments and following his death at the age of 80 on 26 July 1965, the Royal College of Physicians received a substantial bequest in his will. His ashes were concealed alongside those of Sir William and Lady Osler in the Osler Library at McGill. His respected chief Osler is remembered in the dining room, named as Cotton had wished, the Osler Room, and in an annual Osler oration. In return, the College honoured Cotton by putting up a plaque in the Osler room and establishing a separate room (known as the "Thomas Cotton Room") to house the library, archives and other possessions of the Osler Club. Some of his archives are held at McGill University in the Osler Library of the History of Medicine

Washington Public Records Act

The Public Records Act (PRA) is a law of the U.S. state of Washington requiring public access to all records and materials from state and locals agencies. It was originally passed as a ballot initiative by voters in 1972 and revised several times by the state legislature. The definition of public records, especially concerning the state legislature, was subject to several legal challenges in the decades since the law was passed.
In 2018, a county judge ruled that legislative records and communications were subject to public disclosure, after a lawsuit was filed by media outlets. In response, the state legislature appealed the ruling and introduced a bill that would exempt their records from the act. The bill was passed by the legislature but was vetoed by Governor Jay Inslee after public outcry; the lawsuit was subsequently ruled in favor of the media outlets and upheld by the Washington Supreme Court.
The act is listed in the "Revised Code of Washington" as Chapter 42, Section 56.
Background.
The Washington Coalition for Open Government (COG) was formed from several political groups in June 1971 to push for public disclosure legislation. The state legislature had debated laws on campaign disclosures repeatedly beginning in 1963 and passed an open meetings law in the 1971 session, but avoided addressing public records. The coalition drafted a "package" of "right-to-know" legislation in an initiative that was filed in March.
The initiative, labeled Initiative to the People 276, raised questions of constitutionality from State Attorney General Slade Gorton, but was allowed onto the November 7 ballot. Initiative 276 was passed by 72 percent of voters, but attracted immediate legal challenges. The initiative became law and took effect on January 1, 1973.
Prior to the initiative's passing, the state legislature passed a law in 1971 defining legislative records as "correspondence, amendments, reports, and minutes of meetings".
Legal challenges.
Records on privately owned devices.
In 2015, the Washington Supreme Court ruled unanimously in a case against Pierce County Prosecutor Mark Lindquist that records created on personal devices are public records if they pertain to public business. The Court established a process for reviewing mixed records to identify and release public records. The California Supreme Court also cited the Lindquist ruling in a similar case.
State legislative records.
In early 2017, journalists from "The Seattle Times" and Northwest News Network filed public records requests for the calendars of Democratic House Speaker Frank Chopp, Senate Democratic Majority Leader Sharon Nelson, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mark Schoesler, and Republican Minority Leader Dan Kristiansen, related to the ongoing debate on education funding in the wake of the McCleary decision. "The Times" reported that lawmakers who had once voluntarily released records, such as emails and calendars, declined during recent sessions over the education funding debate, citing an exemption in the 1971 public records definition. Other media outlets filed records requests for all 147 members of the state legislature during the 2017 sessions, but were rebuffed or redirected to lawyers. Other public records requests related to sexual harassment and misconduct allegations levied against state legislators were also denied.
On September 12, 2017, the Associated Press and other Washingtonian news organizations filed a lawsuit against the state legislature over the alleged exemption for daily schedules, emails, text messages, and other correspondence related to legislative work. The lawsuit was heard in the Thurston County Superior Court, where a judge ruled in favor of the media coalition, finding that the offices of individual legislators were subject to the Public Records Act. The law would, however, not apply to administrative offices in the state legislature, under the judge's ruling. The ruling was upheld by a 7–2 decision of the Washington Supreme Court on December 19, 2019, but administrative offices were excluded from the definition of state agencies.
While the state legislature appealed the ruling, a bill to remove the legislature from the Public Records Act was announced by state legislators on February 21. The proposed bill allowed limited release of lawmaker calendars and final disciplinary reports beginning July 1, but exempted retroactive records, as well as policy development records and potentially private information. It was given a committee work session and public hearing less than 24 hours after being announced in a bid to hasten its passing. On February 23, the bill was passed by the State Senate 41–7 and State House 83–14, less than 48 hours after becoming public and with only four legislators speaking during the debate.
In response to the bill's passing and impending action by Governor Jay Inslee, "The Times" and twelve other large newspapers in Washington state published front-page editorials urging Inslee to veto the bill. For "The Times", it was the first front-page editorial to be published in 110 years, the last being a call for wealthy businessmen to support the then-upcoming Alaska–Yukon–Pacific Exposition in 1908. By Wednesday, February 28, over 8,000 emails and 4,300 phone calls were received by the Governor's Office in opposition of the bill's signing. In an interview with on MSNBC's "All In with Chris Hayes", Governor Inslee said that he was opposed to the bill but stated that the bill's "veto-proof majority" would prevent him from blocking it. On March 1, Inslee vetoed the bill, citing public outcry and calls from lawmakers who regretted the bill's accelerated passage.

Alfred White Franklin

Alfred White Franklin FRCP (2 June 1905 – 20 September 1984) was an English neonatologist and paediatrician who edited numerous books on child abuse, founded the British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, kept an interest in medical history and wrote on child matters. He was a prominent figure in the field of child abuse prevention.
He co-founded the Osler Club of London while he was a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London and later wrote a biography of Sir William Osler. 
After qualifying from St Bartholomew's, he became a paediatrician with the Emergency Medical Service during the Second World War. He became one of England's early neonatologists at the Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital, after which he held a position as senior physician in the children's department at St Bartholomew's and eventually head of its department, remaining there until retirement.
Franklin was a member of Council of the Royal College of Physicians, president of the British Paediatric Association and president of the British Society for Medical History. Subsequently, he became president of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect (now the Association of Child Protection Professionals). 
Early life and family.
Alfred White Franklin, also known as "the bishop", was born in London on 2 June 1905, to Philip Franklin, an Ear, Nose and Throat surgeon in Wimpole Street, and Ethel Julia. After completing his early schooling at The Hall School, Hampstead, he attended Epsom College, where he was a prefect, studied the classics and won numerous prizes including the Engledue Essay and Rosebery English Literature Prize.
In 1943, Franklin married Ann Vaisey, daughter of Francis Vaisey, a clerk in holy orders. They had four children. Franklin's work on child abuse and neglect was most likely encouraged by his wife, who was a social worker and magistrate.
Medical training and the Osler Club.
Franklin received a scholarship to study medicine at Clare College, Cambridge. In 1926, whilst at Cambridge, he went on a transatlantic trip to Canada and the USA with the Cambridge University Medical Society and became enchanted by William Osler, the 'Oslerian legacy' and "the value" of maintaining "cooperation between the English speaking peoples". A year later, as a medical student at St Bartholomew's Hospital, Franklin was the Lawrence scholar and a gold medallist. Here, he became good friends with Walter Reginald Bett. In their plans to form a student club of medical history, Franklin had wished to name it after his hero, Sir Clifford Allbutt. However, Bett had his own ideas and took Franklin to visit Sir William’s home in Oxford and spoke to his [Sir William's] nephew, Dr. Francis. Franklin noted in his diary that "during that morning I was infected, as Bett planned, with the virus of Oslerolatry". Franklin had co-founded this elite 'Osler Club', which then met and dined regularly at Franklin's home in Harley Street, where he lived with his father.
He graduated from St Bartholomew's in 1933.
Career.
Between 1934 and 1935, Franklin was Temple Cross research fellow at Johns Hopkins Hospital, returning to St Bartholomew's as assistant physician in the children's department.
Neonatology.
Franklin became one of the UK's earliest neonatologists, assisting under Alan Moncrieff at Queen Charlotte's Maternity Hospital. During the Second World War, he worked at Hill End and St Alban's Hospitals as a paediatrician for Sector 3 of the Emergency Medical Service.
Appointments.
He was elected a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians in 1942, followed three years later by his appointment as physician to the children's department at St Bartholomew's Hospital, of which he became head in 1965. Franklin held his teaching sessions in the hospital ward playrooms and was described in Munk's Roll as having an "intuitive understanding of the problems and distress, both emotional and practical, suffered by the family of a sick – perhaps mortally – or handicapped child".
Franklin was a member of the college council from 1966–69, president of the British Paediatric Association from 1968–69 and president of the British Society for Medical History from 1974–76. Between 1970 and 1978, he was Deputy Chairman of the Attendance Allowance Board of the Department of Health and Social Security. Later, he became president of the International Society for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect from 1981–82.
Franklin was Osler orator in 1971 and he remained in close contact with the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at the McGill University, Montreal. He later wrote a biography of William Osler.
Child protection.
Franklin was one of the first to recognise that child abuse was much more common and serious in the United Kingdom than the public realised and that the cooperation between the different professions involved was inadequate. Franklin argued that perpetrators of child abuse could only be stopped if, like sufferers from leprosy and venereal disease in the past, society allowed them to come into the open. His approach was instrumental in bringing together doctors, social workers and lawyers to coordinate investigations into child abuse. He established a working party that initiated the Tunbridge Wells Study Group in 1973, a small interdisciplinary group that sowed the seed of the now large British Association for the Study and Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect. and the subsequent historical landmark book, "Concerning Child Abuse".
Later life.
Franklin spent his later life deeply involved in child protection and working to prevent child abuse. He continued to edit numerous books on child abuse, kept his interest in medical history and carried on writing on child matters.
He died on 20 September 1984, while on holiday in Italy.

Clarinet Sonata (Ries)

Ferdinand Ries composed his Clarinet Sonata in G minor, Op. 29, in Bonn in 1809 according to his thematic catalog, but it was not published until 1812 by Simrock without a dedication. Its composition history is unclear but it may have been written with a particular clarinetist in mind. The work has sometimes been transcribed for violin.
Composition history.
Like for the composer's Clarinet Trio, Op. 28, there is little documentation relating to the circumstances under which it was composed or performed, but the fact that the work was widely published suggests it was well received.
Martin Harlow writes that the work was probably composed with a specific skilled clarinetist in mind, citing the fact that the work is written as a true duet with both instruments given equal prominence, whereas many of the composer's later flute sonatas, composed for the amateur market, are dominated by the piano with the flute providing melodic support only. Hagels supports this conjecture by noting that the final movement of the work contains provision for the clarinetist to play improvised cadenzas. In addition, Harlow states that when he examined the printed score, it was clear that the work had been composed as a clarinet sonata and then transcribed for violin rather than the other way round.
Instrumentation and structure.
The work is instrumented for clarinet (or violin) and piano. It is in three movements:
Bert Hagels comments in his liner notes that much of the structure (but not the themes) in the first movement makes use of musical procedures which Beethoven pioneered in his Piano Sonata, Op. 53 and Symphony, Op.67.
Martin Harlow identifies this sonata as an important milestone in the development of the clarinet sonata because this work is one of the earliest known clarinet sonatas where there is balance between effective writing for the clarinet that exploits its full potential, and innovative thematic material.

Linda Kasonde

Linda Kasonde is a Zambian legal practitioner and partner at Mulenga Mundashi Kasonde Legal Practitioners. She rose to prominence as the first elected female President of the Law Association of Zambia (LAZ) and for her advocacy of human rights.
Education.
Kasonde obtained her LLB Law Degree from Leicester University in England in the year 2000. Thereafter, she was admitted to the Zambian Bar in 2001. She obtained her commercially biased Masters in Law (LLM) in 2007 from the University of Cape Town in South Africa. Linda Kasonde is also a 2013 alumnus of the Harvard Leadership in the 21st Century Executive Programme.
Career.
After being admitted to the Zambian Bar in 2001, Kasonde preceded to work as an advocate at the "National Legal Aid Clinic for Women" and was subsequently hired by "Mulenga Mundashi &amp; Company" in 2004. It was at that law firm that she later became the first woman in Zambia to be promoted to named partner in an established and internationally recognised law firm.
In April 2016, Kasonde was elected President of LAZ by the association's members during its fifth annual conference. Over the course of the next two years, she became a well-known figure in Zambia for using her public platform as LAZ president to resolutely defend constitutional democracy, civil liberties and the rule of law. In this role, she attracted occasional controversy as government representatives felt she was overly political, especially when drawing attention to allegations of constitutional violations by the ruling authorities.
A year after her election, in April 2017, Kasonde faced public pushback when Lusaka lawyer Kelvin Fube Bwalya filed a motion of no confidence in the LAZ Council under her leadership. Fube, a prominent member of the governing Patriotic Front, accused the Kasonde-led LAZ Council of having failed to effectively run the association and consequently called for its removal. At an Extraordinary General Meeting called to discuss the issue, Fube's proposal met strong opposition from other LAZ members present, a development that prompted him to withdraw the motion before voting could take place.
Kasonde stepped down as LAZ president in April 2018 following the conclusion of her term of office, although she was eligible to seek another. She returned to private practice and continues to be involved in civil society activities. She was elected as the Vice President of the Commonwealth Lawyers Association in 2019. 
In September 2019 Kasonde launched the Civil Society Organisation, Chapter One Foundation. According to Linda Kasonde, Chapter One Foundation was born from the growing threat on Human rights, constitutionalism and the rule of law in Zambia.
Awards.
Kasonde was awarded the Epic Alumni for "Women Inspiring Women" at IE Business School. She also received the award of the Zambia Society for Public Administration's Justice Irene Chirwa Mambilima in 2016.

Ugly Delicious

Ugly Delicious is a non-fiction original series on Netflix combining travel, cooking, and history. Each episode highlights one dish or concept, and explores how it is made in different regions and how it evolves.
The first season premiered on February 23, 2018 with host David Chang. On November 22, 2018, it was renewed for a second season, which premiered on March 6, 2020. The second season contained only half as many episodes as the first, likely due to Chang's increasingly busy schedule and the birth of his first child.
Plot.
Each episode examines the cultural, sociological, and culinary history of a specific popular food. Chang challenges and explores the attitudes in each dish's lore. Mike Hale wrote in his review for "The New York Times" that "Ugly Delicious" is "an extended television essay, in the form of free-associative, globe-trotting conversations about food and culture."
Reception.
Critical reviews have mostly been positive. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 100% based on 21 reviews, with an average rating of 8.33/10 for the first season. The website's critical consensus states, ""Ugly Delicious" injects new life into the food documentary by dispensing with culinary pretensions and celebrating a vibrant spectrum of dishes that are sure to whet audience appetites." Metacritic gave the series a weighted average score of 77 out of 100 based on 5 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Greg Morabito of "Eater" called the series' first season "maddeningly good" claiming that it, "raises the bar for food/travel shows." Jen Chaney of "Vulture" praised the show's first season for raising important cultural issues and taking "a highly egalitarian approach to cuisine."

Stain repellent

A stain repellent is a product added to fabric in order to prevent stains.
Stains.
Stains on fabrics are classified into three types: water-based stains and oil-based stains or a mix of both.
Stain repellant fabrics.
Fabrics are finished with certain finishes that do not allow unwanted stains or that will wash out in simple laundry.
Chemicals.
Mostly larger PFCAs such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are used in stain repellancy. It is also known colloquially as C8. PFOA is a product of health concern and subject to regulatory action and voluntary industrial phase-outs.
Alternative chemistry.
There are chemicals which are based on C8 free chemistry that may be used as an alternative to PFOA, but those are less durable.

Kuo-Kuang Motor Transportation () is a bus company in Taiwan.
History.
Kuo-Kuang was established on July 1, 2001 as a result of the privatization of state-owned Taiwan Motor Transport (臺灣汽車客運公司). After the state-run company announced its intention to close, some 1,090 employees each contributed NT$300,000 in order to raise the funds necessary to purchase the firm's assets and relaunch the service as Kuo-Kuang. As of 2013, the company's fleet comprised more than 1,200 buses. In January 2016, the final Greyhound buses still being used on regular Kuo-Kuang routes were retired.

Works.
Hounkpati B Christophe Capo has worked on the rehabilitation of the languages of the Gbe dialectal continuum, previously known as the Aja-Eve languages of the Gulf of Benin in West Africa. Beginning in 1930, publications on the Gbe languages rapidly appeared, the vast majority on individual Gbe languages.
Capo set out a classification of the Gbe languages and a reconstruction of the phonology of proto-Gbe. Much of the comparative research for this classification was carried out by Capo in the 1970s, and partial results were published in the 1970s and early 1980s as articles on specific phonological developments in various branches of the Gbe dialectal continuum, and notably as a standard spelling for Gbe languages.
His first major work, "Renaissance du Gbe" (1988), published a classification of the Gbe languages for the first time. In 1991, he published "Comparative phonology of Gbe". In this period, he also founded the Labo Gbe (Int.), the "Laboratoire de recherche sur les langues Gbe" (Research Laboratory on Gbe Languages) based in Benin, which promotes research and has published several articles and documents on Gbe languages. The Labo Gbe, in Gadomè on the Cotonou-Lomé road 40 km from Cotonou, has an impressive collection of documentation and a scientific journal titled Etudes Gbe – Gbe Studies.

An Inconvenient Sequel (book)

An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power: Your Action Handbook to Learn the Science, Find Your Voice, and Help Solve the Climate Crisis is a book by former Vice President and environmental activist Al Gore, written in conjunction with his 2017 documentary film, "." The book is a sequel to his 2006 book "An Inconvenient Truth", published concurrently with his documentary of the same name. It was published on July 25, 2017 by Rodale Books.
Synopsis.
The book is intended to encourage and inform readers on how they can help fight anthropogenic global warming and climate change, and is a more in-depth analysis than the film. The book describes how humans have further damaged the environment since the release of "An Inconvenient Truth", and makes more predictions about what will happen in the near future if humans fail to act. The book also describes advancements that have been made so far in the effort against global warming, such as developments in alternative energy sources. The book explores other aspects of the climate crisis, such as climate change denial and the corporate influence of money in politics, and ends by reasoning that it is not too late to solve the crisis.

Eversdal, Bellville

Eversdal is a suburb in Bellville, Western Cape, South Africa.
History.
The name of the suburb of Eversdal is believed to have originated with Vryburger Evert, who was born Evert van Guinea in 1639 and ran a farming operation on today's Eversdal, Bellville, Western Cape, which grew vegetables, nuts and fruit. He leased the land from the Dutch East India Company in 1680.
The land now known as Eversdal has been owned by several people including Heinrich Omswald Eckstein (23 February 1678–23 September 1741) originally from Bad Lobenstein, Thuringia, Germany. Eckstein married Sara Heyns from the van der Merwe bloodline (1685–1713). Other family members who may be historically linked to this region are Johannes Louw (1764–1803); Pieter Joosten (born 1758), who was in the region from 1803 to 1815; and Jacobus Wynand Louw (1778–1847). Heirs of Jacobus Wynand Louw include daughter Sibella Magretha Louw (1818–1892). She married Petrus Johannes Schabort (1804–1880). The Schabort family then owned the land from 1855 into the early 20th century, when residential development began in the region.
Location.
Eversdal is located close to the N1 and shopping centres. The only school in the area is Eversdal Primary School. Areas bordering Eversdal are Kenridge, Stellenberg and Rosendal. 
Climate.
Eversdal experiences warm, dry summers with mild, moist winters and an average rainfall of .465 m per annum. Its average coldest winter temperature is 7.1 °C overnight with an average summer daytime temperature of 27 °C.

Thomas Cooke (English footballer)

Thomas Cooke was an English footballer who played in The Football League for Notts County.
Early career.
All that is known is Thomas Cooke played for Notts Rangers, was signed for the one game he played, and returned to Notts Rangers. Notts Rangers did not play in a League until the 1889-1890 season.
1888.
Thomas Cooke made his Notts County and Football League debut at Trent Bridge, Nottingham on 8 December 1888. The opponents were high-flying Aston Villa, with only 1,500 in attendance. Cooke played at outside-right. The weather was terrible, heavy rainfall, and Notts County had prioritized a FA Cup tie so the League team was described as a “scratch” side.
Many County players were making their Club or League debuts and some, including Thomas Cooke, never played again after this match. However, one contemporary commentator stated that the new boys, including Thomas Cooke, did well. County goalkeeper Tom Widdowson could do nothing to stop the shot from Albert Brown that put Villa ahead. Widdowson had parried a powerful shot from Villa forward, Archie Hunter, but he couldn’t hold the ball which fell to Brown who scored. County played well after going behind and Thomas Cooke powered two shots goal-bound but both struck the goalpost. County got back into the game and scored a deserved equalizer by Bob Jardine. 1-1 at Half-Time.
Villa forward Archie Goodall restored Villa’ lead. Goodall latched onto a shot by fellow forward, Tommy Green and swept the ball past Widdowson. County rallied again after falling behind and scored a second equalizer by debut man Fred Weightman. County did have a chance to take the lead and Cooke was well placed to put County ahead. However, he shot wide. After Cooke’ miss it was all Villa. Tommy Green restored Villa’ lead and Archie Goodall made sure of the two points with his second goal in the match. Full Time score Notts County 2-4 Aston Villa.
Thomas Cooke commenced his Football League career at outside-right on 8 December 1888 at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, (see above for details). Cooke only made the one League appearance.
Cooke played one League match for Notts County and when he played his team scored two goals (out of 40) and conceded four out of 73 goals. The 40 goals scored was the joint third lowest tally by any League club that season. The 73 goals conceded was the worst by any League club in 1888-1889. Notts County finished 11th and had to seek re-election.
1889 onwards.
It is assumed from the limited information that Thomas Cooke returned to Notts Rangers.

Parliamentary elections were held in Djibouti on 23 February 2018. The election was boycotted by the main opposition parties, including some of the parties in the Union for National Salvation coalition, which had won 10 seats in the previous elections in 2013.
According to government figures, the ruling Union for the Presidential Majority won 57 of 65 seats in Parliament. The opposition Union for Democracy and Justice–Djibouti Party for Development (UDJ–PDD) won seven seats in Djibouti city electoral district. The UMP ran unopposed in three electoral districts (Dikhil, Obock and Arta, 18 seats).
Electoral system.
Prior to the 2013 the previous winner-takes-all party block vote was abandoned. Instead the elections were held using a closed list system in which 80% of seats (rounded to the nearest integer) in each constituency were awarded to the party receiving the most votes. The remaining seats were allocated proportionally to other parties receiving over 10% of the vote using the D'Hondt method. In cases where no other party received more than 10% of the vote, all seats in a constituency were awarded to the party receiving the most votes. There was also a 25% female quota, up from 10% in the previous election.

Young at Heart (Howard McGhee and Teddy Edwards album)

Young at Heart is an album by trumpeter Howard McGhee and saxophonist Teddy Edwards recorded in 1979 and released on the Storyville label.
Reception.
In his review for AllMusic, Scott Yanow stated "Tenor saxophonist Teddy Edwards was in trumpeter Howard McGhee's group during 1945-47. Over 30 years later they reunited for what would be McGhee's final recording sessions (although the trumpeter lived until 1987). ... McGhee and Edwards are in excellent form on a set filled with bop standards".

Coastal Leader

Coastal Leader is a weekly newspaper published in Kingston, South Australia, founded in 1962 and published under this title since 2001. It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media. 
History.
The "Coastal Leader" website claims that the newspaper's origins can be traced back to the Kingston Weekly, the newspaper of The Kingston Traders' Association. The "Kingston Weekly" was first issued on 22 March 1946, with the aim was to "record faithfully the growing needs of the district in business as well as pleasure". The newspaper quickly ran into difficulties, and by early 1947 they were unable to continue, due to a "lack of support and continually rising costs", such that the newspaper was taken over by a group of local businessmen. It then ran until 30 March 1951 (issue No. 258). 
A decade later, another newspaper called South-East Kingston Leader was started in Kingston. This publication proved to be more successful, continuing from 1962 until 21 November 2001 (Vol. 40, no. 46), when it was renamed to its current title, "Coastal Leader". Alongside many other rural publications in Australia, the newspaper was a member of Fairfax Media Limited.
Distribution.
The "Coastal Leader" circulates throughout Kingston, Robe and Coorong districts. It has a potential readership of 2,700 per week, based on a run of 1,500 copies (20 full-colour pages) printed each Wednesday morning at Murray Bridge. Of these 1,350 are sold through outlets in Kingston, Robe, Lucindale, Naracoorte, Mount Gambier, and Adelaide with the remainder as subscriptions.
Preservation.
The State Library of South Australia carries microfiche versions of the newspaper.

The Turning (2020 film)

The Turning is a 2020 American supernatural horror film directed by Floria Sigismondi and written by Carey W. Hayes and Chad Hayes. It is a modern adaptation of the 1898 ghost story "The Turn of the Screw" by Henry James. The film stars Mackenzie Davis, Finn Wolfhard, Brooklynn Prince, and Joely Richardson, and follows a young governess in 1994 who is hired to watch over two children after their parents are killed.
The film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for Steven Spielberg, who wanted to be involved in a horror film again. The adaptation went through two phases of production: first as "Haunted" with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo attached as director, then as "The Turning" with Sigismondi. Filming took place at Killruddery House, County Wicklow, Ireland from February through April 2018.
"The Turning" had its world premiere at Los Angeles Film Festival on January 23, 2020, and was theatrically released in the United States on January 24, 2020, by Universal Pictures. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes called it "stylish but muddled", and it received generally unfavorable reviews on Metacritic.
Plot.
Miss Jessel, the live-in tutor at the Fairchild Estate, flees the house in a panic and is attacked by a ragged man.
Sometime later, in 1994, Kate Mandell becomes a governess for seven year old Flora Fairchild after Miss Jessel's disappearance. Before leaving, she visits her mother, Darla, who lives in a mental institution because she suffers from delusions. At the Fairchild Estate, Kate is informed by the caretaker Mrs. Grose that Flora witnessed her parents die in a car accident and is a "special case". Flora confesses to Kate that she is afraid Kate will leave her like Miss Jessel did but Kate promises not to.
That night, Kate encounters Flora's brother Miles, who is back from boarding school. The next day, she receives a call from the school's principal, who informs her that Miles is expelled after having been found strangling another boy. Kate becomes more aggravated with Miles when he and Flora begin pulling pranks on her, lashing out at him. Miles suggests he teach her how to ride horses to make it up to her, as their former riding instructor Quint has recently died.
Kate notices strange occurrences happening at night, so she begins to keep her lights on when she goes to sleep. One day she suggests they go into town, to the dismay of both Flora and Mrs. Grose. Flora throws a fit and runs out of the car after Kate refuses to stop it. Miles warns her to leave but Kate decides to stay due to her promise to Flora. After reconciling, the group plays tag in the house. While looking for Miles, Kate is attacked by the ghost of Miss Jessel. She finds Miss Jessel's journal, which contains frightening entries about how Quint was obsessed with her and took pictures of her while she slept. Mrs. Grose tells her that Quint died a couple weeks following Miss Jessel's departure when he fell from his horse while riding drunk. Kate continues to see Quint and Miss Jessel's ghosts around the house, making her paranoid.
She receives art from her mother in the mail, and Mrs. Grose comments that she hopes Kate's mother's condition isn't genetic. Kate discovers Miss Jessel's dead body in a pond on the house's grounds. She also has a vision of Quint raping and strangling Miss Jessel and tells Mrs. Grose, who appears to have already known about it. Mrs. Grose assures her that she made sure Quint died. Quint's ghost pushes Mrs. Grose over the stair banister, killing her. Kate and the children flee the house, managing to escape in her car.
This previous sequence is revealed to have been Kate's vision as she heard Mrs. Grose's words and looked at her mother's art. She walks in on the children talking about her and becomes convinced that she sees Quint's ghost in the mirror, insisting that Flora saw him too, despite her protests. When Kate accidentally breaks Flora's doll, Miles calls her delusional. They then walk out of the room. In Kate's imagination, she walks into her mother's institution and approaches a figure; as the figure turns around, Kate screams. The face of the figure is not revealed, and it is left open to interpretation as to whether Kate has seen her mother or is in fact seeing a reflection of herself.
Production.
Development.
The film first entered development in March 2016 and was described as a passion project for Steven Spielberg, as he wanted to be involved in a horror film again. The film adaptation went through two phases of production: first as "Haunted" with Juan Carlos Fresnadillo attached as director, then the ultimate version, renamed as "The Turning", with Floria Sigismondi.
Fresnadillo project (2016).
On March 9, 2016, "Deadline Hollywood" reported that Amblin Entertainment was hiring Juan Carlos Fresnadillo to direct a film titled "Haunted", which would be inspired by Henry James' 1898 gothic ghost story, "The Turn of the Screw". It would be scripted by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, with Roy Lee of Vertigo Entertainment, John Middleton and Scott Bernstein as producers. "Haunted", which was to shoot under the DreamWorks label, would have been one of the first new projects to move forward since DreamWorks, Amblin and Participant Media formed the new Amblin Partners in late 2015, and after DreamWorks, which had been distributing its films through Disney's Touchstone Pictures since 2008, had struck a new distribution deal with Universal.
On August 1, 2016, it was announced that Alfre Woodard had signed on to the project. Later that month, Rose Leslie joined as the lead.
On September 21, 2016, five weeks before shooting was set to begin, Spielberg personally pulled the plug on the project because Scott Z. Burns' partial rewrite caused seismic changes in the story's fabric, altering characters, action, and even the title, and it no longer resembled the project the studio had signed on to make. Spielberg and DreamWorks decided the best course of action was to fire Fresnadillo and Burns, and resume using Hayes' original script, looking to start fresh development with a new director despite $5 million having been spent of the $17 million budget.
Sigismondi project (2017 onward).
On August 24, 2017, "Deadline" reported that Amblin Entertainment had set Floria Sigismondi to direct "Haunted", now renamed as "The Turning", which would feature a new draft by Jade Bartlett based on the original script by Chad and Carey W. Hayes. Production was expected to start in early 2018 with Scott Bernstein and Roy Lee still attached as producers, along with Seth William Meier. In October 2017, Mackenzie Davis signed on to portray the lead role of the nanny. In December 2017, it was announced that Finn Wolfhard had been cast as one of the orphans, and in January 2018, Brooklynn Prince was cast as the other. In February 2018, others actors were announced as principal production commenced. The casting of Joely Richardson was announced in January 2019.
Filming.
Principal production began in Ireland on February 14, 2018, and filming began with the cast and crew behind strict security at Killruddery House in County Wicklow. Filming for Wolfhard and Prince concluded on March 27, 2018. Principal photography for the film completed on April 6, 2018.
Music.
The film's score is composed by Nathan Barr. Lawrence Rothman and their brother Yves helped "curate" the film's original soundtrack, which was deemed by "Thrillist" as better than the movie itself. The film's original soundtrack features tracks from Pale Waves, Mitski, girl in red, Kali Uchis, Vagabon, Courtney Love, Warpaint, Alice Glass, The Aubreys, Lawrence Rothman and Soccer Mommy,
Release.
"The Turning" was theatrically released on January 24, 2020, domestically and in select international territories. Universal Pictures had originally scheduled the film for February 22, 2019. In September 2018, the film was moved back, with DreamWorks Animation's "" being slated in its place.
Reception.
Box office.
"The Turning" grossed $15.5 million in the United States and Canada, and $3.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $19.4 million.
In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside "The Gentlemen", and was projected to gross $7–9 million from 3,000 theaters in its opening weekend. The film made $2.5 million on its first day, including $425,000 from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $7.3 million, finishing sixth at the box office. It then fell 56% to $3.1 million in its second weekend, finishing eighth.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 11% based on 98 reviews, with an average rating of 3.58/10. The website's critics consensus reads, "Stylish but muddled, this misbegotten adaptation of Henry James' classic novel will send horror-hungry viewers "Turning" to the source material instead." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews." Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare average grade of "F" on an A+ to F scale (one of only 22 films to receive the rating, ), while PostTrak reported an overall positive score of 34% (including an average 0 out of 5 stars), with 20% of people saying they would definitely recommend the film.

Microtis graniticola

Microtis graniticola, commonly known as the granite mignonette orchid or granite onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small green to greenish-yellow flowers. It grows in soil pockets on granite outcrops, especially where the soil receives run-off during rainy weather.
Description.
"Microtis graniticola" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and sixty green to yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a stiff, rigid flowering stem tall. The flowers lean downwards and are long, wide with an ovary long. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, about wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are oblong, long, about wide with their tips rolled downwards. The petals are oblong, about long, wide and are enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, long, about wide and curves downwards with thickened, wavy edges and a notched tip. The callus in the centre of the labellum is variable in shape, but never comma-shaped as in the otherwise similar "M. eremicola". Flowering occurs from September to November.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis graniticola" was first formally described in 1996 by Robert Bates from a specimen collected on Wave Rock near Hyden and the description was published in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Garden". The specific epithet ("graniticola") is Latin for "granite dweller", referring to the habitat preference of this species.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis graniticola" grows in shallow soil pockets on large granite outcrops in arid areas between Balladonia and Mullewa. Its distribution includes parts of the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie, Geraldton Sandplains, Mallee, Murchison and Yalgoo biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Microtis eremaea" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Glen Massey

Glen Massey is a former mining village, west of Ngāruawāhia, which was, until 1958, terminus of the Glen Massey Line. It then went into decline, but is now becoming a home for Hamilton commuters.
Name.
There is no official name. Various names appeared on maps and in reports of the area.
Mangahoa is the only name in the area shown on an 1859 map, probably applying to what was later called the Mangaohe Stream, called Mangaohei in an 1867 report, and used on maps up to 1966, but officially named Firewood Creek in 1976. As early as 1909 a report referred to Firewood Creek.
Kupa Kupa was the name used at the 1860s compensation hearings for the area north of Te Awa o te Atua (River of God - now Firewood Creek), and stretching to what is now Huntly, as it included the former village of that name near Huntly.
Te Akatea (translates to white rata, which was plentiful) village settlement of 22 settlers was formed in 1887, spread along much of the route between Ngāruawāhia and Waingaro. The name is still retained by a hamlet about north of what is now Glen Massey.
Glen Massey seems to have first appeared in 1914. One source asserts there was a large Scottish population in the area, the name ‘Glen’ means ‘valley’, and the name ‘Massey’ honoured the Prime Minister, William Massey, elected in 1912.
Geology.
The geology of Glen Massey accounts for its rise and fall as a former coal mining centre.
The 1925 map below shows a simple layout. Since then, maps of 1966 and 2005 have differentiated more strata, as in this list, starting with the oldest rocks -
Triassic (L on the map - 250-200mya), in the Newcastle Formation. They are -
Jurassic (T - 200-145mya) 
Eocene (CM - 33-27mya) Waikato coal measures (see next section).
Oligocene (K - late Whaingaroan - 30mya) Glen Massey Formation, named after this locality -
The Late Pliocene to Middle Quaternary (3.6-0.8mya) in the lowlands -
The Late Pleistocene (0.13-0.012mya) also in the valleys -
Coal mining.
Although the Kupakupa, Renown and Kemps Seams are all present, only Kupakupa has been worked to any extent. Kupakupa Seam reserves are estimated at less than 40 000 tonnes, although 2m tonnes may be concealed under the northern area, and over 1m in 'sub-economic' seams of the old Waipa Colliery.
The beds are in a graben and dip gently N or NW. Major faults strike N or NNW and minor faults NE.
Glen Massey's coal was known of by 1867, when it was suggested a tramway should be built down the Mangaohei valley. However, seams closer to river transport were available, so no significant exploitation began until 1907.
Between 1914 and 1977 about 3.5m tonnes of coal were dug in the Glen Massey coalfield, as follows - 
A 1976 estimate said 30,000 tons might remain in the coalfield, but a 1984 report suggested it was too deep for economic opencasting.
Waipa Colliery.
In 1907 a request was made to transport coal by motor vehicle and, in 1908, the Ngaruawahia Dairy Association took 3 tons of coal a week from the seams that were to become Waipa Colliery, during a strike at Huntly mines. A start was made on a tramway in 1908, soon described as a light railway for the Co-operative Coal Co Ltd, set up by 3 farmers, soon renamed Ngaruawahia Coal Co Ltd. and merged into Waipa Railway and Collieries Ltd. An adit into an seam had been started by 1911.
Clay.
The China Clay and Porcelain Co Ltd was formed in 1924 to export china clay and make bricks, tiles and bathroom-ware. It probably only made bricks in any quantity. It went into voluntary liquidation in April 1930. 
History.
The archaeology map shows no sites between Ngāruawāhia and Waingaro, though many stone axe heads were found on nearby Te Akatea farm, which was largely bush until it was burnt after 1905. Therefore, it's likely the area was largely bush until the arrival of the first settlers, being used by the surrounding populations for food and clothing, including birds, bracken, karaka, hinau, nikau, kahikatea, raupo, kiekie; flax, dyes from muds, bark, or berries and oils from seeds such as titoki.
Te Akatea settlement.
After confiscation in 1863, the area was next mentioned in 1879 as not belonging to the Waste Lands Board. At Te Akatea, in 1887, a village settlement of 22 families was formed. An 1888 report said, ""I determined when opportunity presented to see if the solution of the problem here was to be a success. These settlements extend from Firewood Creek to within 7 miles of the Hot Springs, and about the same distance from Ngāruawāhia. The land being of fair quality, consisting of both bush and open fern land. They erected 12 timber houses, felled bush, sown grass, orchards, gardens, fenced, grew wheat. Around this settlement 20,000 acres of Government land are now being surveyed for settlement"." Te Akatea post office opened in 1889. The first mention of Te Akatea in the annual sheep returns was in 1891.
Mining village.
At its peak Glen Massey had a general store, butcher, post office (replacing Te Akatea in 1914), hall, church and a fire station. The medical association had 120 members in 1919 and 90 in 1920.
A 1919 Board of Trade report described Glen Massey's poor housing, saying it, ""is totally inadequate for the needs of the workers, and overcrowding exists. In one case, a miner, with his wife and five children, is living in a two-roomed cottage, and in another ease there are five persons (three children) living in two rooms. At least 10 roomy houses are required for immediate needs. The huts provided by the Waipa Company at present have no fire-places or water tanks, and both these necessary conveniences should be provided"."
The village also had a sawmill, brickworks and a pottery. The butcher closed in 1962, the store in 1967 and the post office in 1984.
Roads.
By 1886 there was a route between Waingaro Landing on the Raglan Harbour and Ngāruawāhia via the Waingaro Hot Springs. In 1888 it was still only a bridle track and the settlers were asking for government employment on the roads. By 1929 it was said to be in "fair order" and metalled. Road improvement is being carried out. relief work on the road. inspected by minister. The road from Ngāruawāhia to Te Akau was sealed by 1976.
Buses.
In 1921 Bob Gibb of Ngāruawāhia took over the mail run to Waingaro and Te Akau and cream run to the Ngāruawāhia butter factory, with a solid tyred International. Daily buses ran from 1930 until between 1958 and 1961.
Education.
The first school in Waingaro was opened in 1892. Education was for 3 days, the other 3 days of the week was given by the same teacher at Te Akatea. Te Akatea School was renamed Glen Massey School in 1914, when the church was moved across the road for use as a school, a marquee was erected and the permanent school opened on 1 February 1915.
Glen Massey School is now a state full primary (years 1-8) school, with 5 classrooms, 6 teachers, a principal, a deputy principal, special needs teacher and 2 teacher aides. Pupil numbers rose from 58 in 1915 to a peak of 146 and 4 teachers in 1957, falling to 64 in 1960. The school had a roll of as of In the 2018 Education Review Office report, a third of the students were Māori.
Utilities.
A private telephone line was being planned in 1914, though a public phone was provided that year and arrangements were being made for a line in 1902. The 1905 estimates had provided for a line from Ngāruawāhia to Waingaro, on which a loss was reported in 1907.
Electricity supply was investigated in 1925 and, in 1930, it was said a line to Wilton Collieries and the village, "would be undertaken as early as possible". Electric street lights came in 1936.
Demographics.
At its peak Glen Massey was home to about 400, but declined after the colliery closures. It is now growing slightly and becoming more prosperous, presumably as, like other parts of the Waikato Western Hills area (up from 1026 in 2006 to 1242 in 2013), it has more commuters to Hamilton. In 2013 19.6% of the Western Hills population was Māori.
Glen Massey was in meshblocks 0853300 (NW), 0853400 (NE), 0853500 (SW) and 0853600 (SE), which had these census figures -
In the 2018 census the area was in blocks which covered a larger area - 7011120 (99 people), 7011117 (150) and 7011124 (165) - total 414.

Jane Tompkins

Jane Tompkins (born 1940) is an American literary scholar who has worked on canon formation, feminist literary criticism, and reader response criticism. She has also coined and developed the notion of cultural work in literary studies and contributed to the new historicist form of literary criticism that emerged in the 1980s. She earned her PhD at Yale in 1966 and subsequently taught at Temple University, Duke University, and the University of Illinois at Chicago. She is married to cultural critic Stanley Fish.
Cultural work.
Tompkins developed her idea of texts doing cultural work in her 1985 book "Sensational Designs: The Cultural Work of American Fiction, 1790-1870". She argues that texts (e.g. novels) do "a certain kind of cultural work within a specific historical situation." To her, "plots and characters" provide "society with a means of thinking about itself, defining certain aspects of a social reality which the authors and their readers shared, dramatizing its conflicts, and recommending solutions. It is the notion of literary texts as doing work, expressing and shaping the social context that produced them, that I wish to substitute finally for the critical perspective that sees them as attempts to achieve a timeless, universal ideal of truth and formal coherence."

Abuna Yemata Guh

Abuna Yemata Guh is a monolithic church located in the Hawzen woreda of the Tigray Region, Ethiopia. It is situated at a height of and has to be climbed on foot to reach. It is notable for its dome and wall paintings dating back to the 5th century and its architecture.
About.
The church is one of the "35-odd rock-hewn churches, the largest concentration anywhere in Ethiopia." It is situated in the erstwhile Gar'alta woreda. The entrance is reached by a steep and hazardous ascent with hand and footholds in the rock. Visitors have to cross a natural stone bridge with a sheer drop of approximately 250m on either side, and thereafter a final narrow wooden footbridge. A strenuous ascent is followed by a climb up a vertical rock wall depending entirely on hand grips and foot holds (without additional support) crowned with a walk over a 50 cm wide ledge facing a cliff of sheer drop. The standing pillars are made up of Enticho and Adigrat Sandstones, which are the last erosional remnants of a sandstone formation that once covered the Precambrian basement.
History.
According to local legend, the church was hewn in the sixth century and dedicated to Abuna Yemata (also referred to as Abba Yem'ata), one of the Nine Saints. The Nine Saints are traditionally believed to have originated from Rome, Constantinople and Syria between the end of the fifth and beginning of the sixth centuries.
Paintings in the church.
The paintings on the walls and domes of the church are preserved in a reasonable state. Extensive study was undertaken to understand the reason behind this phenomenon. The design of the traceries in the church replicates those found in nearby churches of Gher'alta, such as Debre Tsion church. There are more paintings depicting figures from the Old Testament than from the New Testament. The dry air and lack of humidity have preserved these frescoes in their original perfection. The paintings date back to initial traces of Christianity in Ethiopia and are themed around the nine saints and twelve apostles. The oldest icons are in the form of diptychs and triptychs dating back to the fifteenth century.

Nsofwa Petronella Sampa

Nsofwa Petronella Sampa is a Zambian HIV activist and clinical psychological counselor. Sampa's work focuses on working with people living with HIV and disabilities. She is a recipient of a Mandela Washington Fellowship, YALI participant and a PEPFAR beneficiary. After discovering her health status as being HIV positive, Sampa began to advocate for persons living with HIV/AIDS.
Early life and education.
Sampa was born in Zambia, a country which has a generalized HIV epidemic. Her father died in 1994 when she was 2 years old and her mother died in 2002 when Sampa was only 10 years old. Sampa's uncle then became her guardian, and she moved to his house. Sampa took medication everyday without knowing why she was taking it or what it was for, or why her cousins living in the same house did not do the same, as the family did not discuss it. In 2002, she had stumbled upon her medical file that revealed life changing information stating that she was HIV positive, but did not ask any questions.
Sampa attended Mary Queen of Peace for her primary education and later was enrolled in a boarding school for her secondary education. Whilst in boarding school, a peer discovered that Nsofwa was on ARV treatment. Soon the entire school was alerted, and Sampa found herself stigmatised, and sleeping alone as other students would not share a dormitory with her. She became very depressed, and she discarded her medication. Her health deteriorated drastically, and she had to leave school. She developed opportunistic infections including tuberculosis and meningitis, as a result of which she became blind and deaf in one ear. Her aunt had engaged an HIV/AIDS specialist, Mannasseh Phiri, to counsel Sampa, and it was from him that she learned that her mother had died due to HIV/AIDS related illness, and that she herself had contracted the virus at birth. After recovering, Sampa attended Munali High School, which offered education for the visually impaired, and learned braille at the Zambia Library for the Visually Impaired. She then studied clinical and psychosocial counselling at Chainama College of Health Sciences in 2013, so that she could work with people living with HIV and disabilities.
Career.
Sampa is an HIV activist and clinical psychological counselor. She works with HIV-positive people to improve their status, live positively, and encourage families to discuss health issues with children. She assists those with HIV to follow treatment regimens. , Sampa is working on the Positive Movement project to empower people with disabilities, especially the blind. 
Awards and honours.
In 2014, she was a beneficiary of the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief. In 2017, she won a Mandela Washington Fellowship from the Young African Leaders Initiative which enabled her to undertake training in civic leadership in the US.

Thomas de Grey (1717–1781)

Thomas de Grey (c. 1717–1781) of Merton Hall, Norfolk was an English landowner and Member of Parliament.
Life.
He was the eldest surviving son of Thomas de Grey and Elizabeth Windham, daughter of William Windham of Felbrigg. His brother William de Grey also became an MP. Thomas junior was baptised on 29 September 1717 and attended school in Bury St Edmunds before going up to Christ's College, Cambridge in 1735. In 1746 he married Elizabeth Fisher, daughter of Samuel Fisher of Bury St Edmunds — this brought him a considerable estate. In 1765 he also inherited Merton Hall on his father's death.
One of the seats for the constituency of Norfolk fell vacant in 1764 when George Townshend succeeded to his father's viscountcy. He recommended that de Grey succeed him and with backing from Townshend's family and the Walpole family he was returned unopposed. He voted against repealing the Stamp Act in 1766 and against administration on the land tax in 1767, before being returned again for Norfolk in 1768 after a very costly campaign. In 1772 he spoke in favour of the Royal Marriages Act but he became more and more affected by gout and so before the next general election in 1773 decided not to stand again.
He died in 1781, leaving no children. Merton Hall passed to his nephew, Thomas de Grey, 2nd Baron Walsingham, son of his brother William.

In his review for "Rolling Stone" Hank Shteamer stated, "No one musician stands out; instead, it’s the song that’s the star – a sign that, personnel swap aside, Never Stop II is Bad Plus business as usual." Nate Chinen of NPR wrote, "That title should be one clue as to the band's intentions. "Never Stop", released in 2010, was the first album by The Bad Plus to consist entirely of original compositions. That's true again of Never Stop II, which features four songs by Anderson and two apiece by King and Evans. Each album can be understood as a planted flag, a marker of group identity. But the transition at hand is cause for close inspection, a reflection on what's changed and what remains the same."
Samuel Stroup of "All About Jazz" added, "On the Never Stop II, The Bad Plus show off their brand new pianist Orrin Evans as a player, improviser, and composer. The trio now enters the next chapter of its being, and it seems the addition of Evans will be a step in the right direction for the group... The tunes on Never Stop II are well-written and earnest, showcasing a band listening and improvising with one another, affirming that the group has not yet run out of meaningful music to make." Matt Collar of AllMusic stated " Never Stop II is a focused, atmospheric set of all-original songs. Technically, the album is a follow-up to the band's first album of all-original material, 2010's Never Stop. However, with Evans on board, the album primarily works as a debut for the trio." Howard Reich of "Chicago Tribune" noted, "Ultimately, Evans and the band’s two veterans seem to be building a new, common language, one influenced both by the Bad Plus’ history and by Evans’ individualistic response to it. If this means that the trio will veer from its comfortable formulas, everyone will benefit."

SrbA sRNA

SrbA (sRNA regulator of biofilms A) is a small regulatory non-coding RNA identified in pathogenic "Pseudomonas aeruginosa""." It is important for biofilm formation and pathogenicity. Bacterial strain with deleted SrbA had reduced biofilm mass. As the ability to form biofilms can contribute to the ability a pathogen to thrive within the host, the "C. elegans" hosts infected with the srbA deleted strain displayed significantly lower mortality rate than the wild-type strain. However, the deletion of srbA had no effect on growth or antibiotic resistance in "P. aeruginosa".

Wayne Burtt

John Wayne Burtt (born 11 June 1944) is a former cricketer who played first-class cricket for Canterbury in New Zealand from 1966 to 1975.
Burtt's father, Noel Burtt, played first-class cricket for Canterbury, as did his uncle, Tom Burtt, who also played Test cricket. A middle-order batsman and occasional leg-spin bowler, Wayne Burtt made his Plunket Shield debut in the fourth match of the 1965-66 season and was never out of the Canterbury side until he moved to Central Districts at the end of the 1972-73 season. In his first match for Canterbury he made 53 and took 4 for 49 as Central Districts hung on for a draw.
He had his most productive season in 1967-68 when he scored 416 runs at an average of 46.22, including his only century, 130 not out against Wellington. Towards the end of the season he was selected to play for a New Zealand Cricket Council President's XI against the touring Indian team, scoring 33 and 71 in a low-scoring match.
He represented South Island twice in 1968-69 – in a trial match against North Island and against the touring West Indies team – but with only moderate success. He spent two seasons with Central Districts in 1973-74 and 1974-75 but was less successful there than with Canterbury, and he retired after the 1974-75 season. He represented Taranaki in the Hawke Cup from 1974 to 1980.

William de Grey

William de Grey (21 October 1652 - 27 February 1687) of Merton Hall, Norfolk was an East Anglian landowner and Tory Member of Parliament. He was the grandfather of his namesake William de Grey, 1st Baron Walsingham.
Life.
The descendant of Suffolk landowners who had acquired a seat at Merton, Norfolk by marriage in the 14th century, he was the only son of James de Grey (died 1665) and Elizabeth Stutevile, daughter of Sir Martin Stutevile of Dalham in Suffolk. James' father had been a Royalist in the Civil Wars, although James himself took part in the Eastern Association committee and local commissions under the Commonwealth and Protectorate and signed the Norfolk address to George Monck for a free parliament in 1660.
William was educated at Thetford before entering Caius College, Cambridge in 1668. He was admitted to Middle Temple in 1671 and four years later wrote a marriage settlement with Elizabeth Bedingfield, daughter of Thomas Bedingfield of Darsham. The couple had seven sons and one daughter, although five of the sons died before their father. The eldest of the two surviving sons, Thomas de Grey also became an MP. William initially became commissioner for assessment for Norfolk in 1673 and for Suffolk in 1679, holding both offices until 1680. In 1676 he also became deputy lieutenant for Norfolk and a year later a major in the foot militia, holding both offices until his death. In 1681 he was made a freeman of Thetford and in 1683 of Dunwich.
He followed up these offices with a political career, successfully contesting Thetford in 1685 and proving quite active during James II's parliament. He took part in committees considering bills on repairing Great Yarmouth pier, relieving imprisoned debtors, improving tillage and increasing the then-low prices on corn and wool, which were major local issue in East Anglia. He attended the Parliament's second session, although it is not known whether or not he favoured James II's policy of religious toleration. He died in 1687 and was buried at Merton.

Sydney to Me

"Sydney to Me" is a song performed by Australian duo Jess &amp; Matt, released on 25 January 2017 to coincide with their performance at the Australia Day concert. The song was commissioned by Destination NSW as their new campaign tune. "Sydney to Me" is the lead and only single from the duo's extended play, "Belmont Street".
Matt Price told the Daily Telegraph “We got this amazing opportunity, we were invited to collaborate on the song, its our home town so it is an honour to put our feeling about Sydney in to a song” with Jess Dunbar adding “The song is a marriage between our love for the city and our relationship. It is based on all the memories of our relationship around New South Wales.” 
In May, the duo performed the song for an episode of American series "Bold and the Beautiful" during the casts' tour of Australia.
In October, the song was recorded in Mandarin, becoming the first Australian artist to record and release a song in Mandarin in Asia. 
Via Instagram on 25 October, the duo announced they were invited by the Australian Government and Tourism Body Destination NSW to represent the country at a number of Asian locations and travelled to China to promote the track. In December, Matt and Jess performed the song in Guangzhou, in front of a packed crowd of delegates including NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian. 
On 16 December 2017, the duo received a plaque for 1.8 million combined steams.
On 15 February 2018, the duo performed a bilingual version of the song at Madame Tussauds Sydney in Sydney for the Lunar New Year celebrations. Mark Connolly, General Manager of Madame Tussauds Sydney said “Jess and Matt have been a pleasure to work with and are highly favourable amongst our Asian guests from both domestic and international markets – as evident in the turnout last night. Their bilingual performance of Sydney To Me was definitely a highlight of the evening,” 
Reception.
In a review of the EP, David from auspOp said “"Sydney to Me" is a nice ode to a city they love... It's a great sentiment for a great city.” 
Andrew P Street from Sydney Morning Herald was critical of the song saying "[it's] a song that sounds like it was looped on a laptop in someone's bedroom" adding "In short, "Sydney to Me" beautifully reflects up the soul of the city right now: vapid, unengaging, and forged entirely by the forces of naked commerce. It's not a song anyone could love, but it's unambiguously the song that we deserve."
Zanda Wilson described the video as a "shockingly insular, cringeworthy, one-dimensional view of Sydney" adding "the overly synthetic, instrument-free song itself is hardly a redeeming factor".

University of Western Australia School of Medicine

The University of Western Australia Medical School is the medical school of The University of Western Australia, located in Perth, Australia. Established in 1957, it is the oldest medical school in Western Australia, with over 6000 alumni. Well-known for its research and clinical teaching, the medical school is ranked 8th in the world and 1st in Australia by the 2019 "Academic Ranking of World Universities" in clinical medicine. The medical school is affiliated with various teaching hospitals in Perth such as Royal Perth Hospital and Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital. The medical school is also heavily affiliated with the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre and its various research institutes. The school has prominent researchers and clinicians amongst its faculty and alumni, including Nobel Prize laureates Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (awarded for the discovery of the "Helicobacter pylori" bacterium); recipients of the Australian of the Year award Fiona Stanley and Fiona Wood; and cancer researcher Richard Pestell. The school has produced 11 Rhodes Scholars.
History.
Before 1957 and the establishment of the medical school, medical students spent a year at UWA before completing their degree at the University of Adelaide or another medical college. A first fundraising appeal for a new medical school was made in 1950, but enjoyed little success. However, due to the booming post-war population of the state, the second fundraising appeal in 1955 garnered significant financial support, and so the new medical school was formally established in 1957 with teaching commencing in the same year. The initial funding of the medical school largely came from the local government and the various communities of Western Australia. 1959 saw the first graduating medical students who were awarded Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degrees.
In 1977, the Sir Charles Gairdner hospital was incorporated into the renamed Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre. The "Perth Medical Centre Act 1966" a few years before established the medical centre and provided the University of Western Australia membership of the trust that is responsible for the management of the land. Nowadays the medical school runs a variety of research collaborations with the medical centre.
Campus.
Most pre-clinical sciences are taught at the University's main campus. The UWA Health Campus, located at the Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, is responsible for most of the clinical teaching done during the course. Although large hospitals in the health campus such as Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital provide most of the clinical education for medical students, a significant number of students are also rotated through rural clinics associated with the university, such as the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia, an affiliated campus for rural clinical education. The various departments of the medical school are also located at the health campus, along with the medical and dental library of the university. The Oral Health Centre of WA and UWA Dental School are also located at the UWA Health Campus, situated next to the library. Because of its proximity, students are able to commute easily between the main campus and the health campus by bicycle.
Curriculum.
Prior to 2012, the primary medical qualification of MBBS was awarded to students who completed either the six year undergraduate degree program or the four year graduate-entry program. After 2012, the MBBS program was discontinued, replaced by the four year graduate-entry Doctor of Medicine degree. However, to ensure accessibility from high school, the medical school offers many Direct Assured Bachelor-MD pathway places to performing school-leavers, which can be completed in six years. Both the MBBS and MD degrees are recognized by the Australian Medical Council and the Singapore Medical Council for provisional registration.
The first year of the medical course starts with foundational Science-based units including systems-based learning. Integrated medical practice begins in second year. The start of the second year has a clinical skills block followed by hospital placements. The third and fourth years continue with integrated medical practice, with various rotations and electives in fields including general practice, paediatrics, surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, psychiatry and ophthalmology. The rotations are done in the major hospitals in the state. Since the state of Western Australia is the second largest country subdivision, a significant number of students also choose to train in the Rural Clinical School of Western Australia, where the standard curriculum and rotations are done in a rural setting. Teaching methods include tutorials, early clinical exposure, lectures, and problem-based learning.
The Western Australian Medical Students' Society is the main society for medical students at the university, and represents the medical students' interests. It is responsible for some of the largest events at the campus and endeavours to involve students in medical networking, conferences, and other activities. The society was founded in 1946 for Western Australian medical students in Adelaide. Therefore the society predates the formation of the medical school itself. The society also issues awards and advice to current and past medical students.
Research.
Research is a large component of the Faculty of Health and Medical Sciences. The university has major research divisions in areas such as internal medicine, pharmacology, paediatrics, population health, psychiatry, surgery, neuroscience and pathology. Much of the research is supported by the Raine Medical Research Foundation, the largest bequest to the university for medical research and collaborations. The university is affiliated with the following centres and institutes:

Whitechapel Road market

Whitechapel Road market, also known as Whitechapel Market is a long-established historic London outdoor street market managed by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets which is centered on the A11 thoroughfare of the same name in Whitechapel in the East End of London, next to Whitechapel station and is the focus point of the Whitechapel Market Conservation Area that was set up in 1997 and extended in 2008.
History.
In 1904 Metropolitan Borough of Stepney sought to take control of the market on the waste in Whitechapel to regulate nuisance traders. Terms were agreed with the Manor of Stepney in 1909 and the Council acquired strips on both north and south sides from Vallance Road east into Mile End Gate where gardens were laid out in 1909–10. Once regulated, trading west of Mile End Gate came to be called Whitechapel Market, though it is still regularly referred to as ‘the Waste’. It was noted in the 1970s for clothing, jewellery, flowers, second-hand records and hi-fi equipment. By the 1980s, when there were 124 pitches between Vallance Road and Cambridge Heath Road, the market was being transformed by a transition to Bangladeshi stallholders. They remain predominant, and there is still much clothing, as well as a range of foods hard to come by elsewhere.
Whitechapel Market was the first market in the United Kingdom to recycle all the waste it generates in 2008. Tower Hamlets Council launched this special new service at a special event that was attended by television presenter, former borough resident and champion of the environment Oliver Heath. He helped the council mark the event by setting up a stall at the market to hand out information about recycling and re-usable shopping bags to passing market customers.
A major operation was coordinated by the Metropolitan Police and the UK Border Agency (UKBA) in 2013 that led to 38 people being arrested or detained. Police also seized more than 500 mobile phones as they rifled through goods at 10 shops and stalls for which search warrants were issued.
Members of Tower Hamlets Wheelers lobby group arrived at Whitechapel Market in 2014 to try to win over stall-holders who have objected to Tfl plans to upgrade a stretch of Whitechapel Road where six cyclists have been killed since 2011. The traders fear a segregated route would cut into the street market and block their deliveries. 30 campaigning cyclists arrived with baskets on their machines and filled up with shopping while trying to convince the traders about how upgrading the current CS2 route would be good for business. The group talked to stall-holders about their concerns and promised they would work with them to make sure the upgrade benefits all parties and were confident that more people will visit the market by bike if it’s made safe.
In 2015, Elsayed Hosny, 64, was punished after he pleaded guilty to failing protect food from contamination at the unit in Brady Street and his business was closed for several weeks after environmental health officers discovered a mouse infestation at the premises.
Whitechapel Market Conservation Area.
The Whitechapel Market Conservation Area was designated in June 1997 and
extended in October 2008. The Conservation Area is named after the market and lies between Cambridge Heath Road to the East London Mosque and Davenant Centre to the West, Whitechapel Road to the south and Durward Street to the north. Many of the buildings fronting Whitechapel Road Market are of architectural and historical importance, and Whitechapel
Road itself is an important and historically significant movement route within East London.
Trade.
The market has developed into a prosperous social and economic that sells a huge array of commodities 6 days a week (Monday to Saturday). Visitors can buy there fresh and exotic fruits and vegetables, different kind of spices, fashion such as cultural wear, bags, scarves and jewellery.
Management.
The market is publicly managed and owned by the London Borough of Tower Hamlets Market Service, the market regulatory service based in Commercial Street, Spitalfields who promotes, licences, develop and support to traders. They also take the approach to market management as an investment in the future, not just solely a regulatory function.

The Icelandic Socialist Party (; SFÍ) is a socialist political party in Iceland, which was founded on International Workers' Day (1 May) in 2017.
The architect behind the party is the editor and author Gunnar Smári, who at the launching of the party declared that it should be "an advocate for wage earners and all those who are poor, invisible and powerless. The opponents of the Icelandic Socialist Party are the rich and those who serve their interests". The main points in the party platform are:
According to Gunnar Smári the party already had 1,400 members at its foundation. At the beginning of May, a temporary board was selected at a meeting to prepare a "Socialist Congress" in the autumn of 2017. Prior to the Congress the party selected four committees among its members by sortition, responsible for healthcare, housing, social welfare, and democratization of society.
The party did not contest the 2017 Althing elections, as it declared itself to be in a "build-up phase," but ran lists in Reykjavík and Kópavogur municipalities in the municipal elections on 26 May 2018. In Reykjavík, they received one of 23 seats with 6.4% of the vote.

Werner Müller (politician)

Wilhelm Werner Müller (1 June 1946 – 15 July 2019) was a German businessman and politician. He served as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy from 1998 to 2002. He then became CEO of RAG AG from 2003, of which Evonik was derived in 2007. His management of a reduction in Germany's dependence on coal in a socially responsible way won him the Manager of the Year award in Germany in 2008. He was chairman of the supervisory board of Deutsche Bahn.
Career.
Born in Essen, Müller attended the in Meppen, completing his Abitur in 1965. He studied in Mannheim, both national economy and piano at the Musikhochschule Mannheim. He later studied philosophy and linguistics in Duisburg and Bremen.
Müller worked from 1973 for RWE. In 1979, he moved to VEBA, which became part of E.ON in 2002.
As a politician, Müller, who belonged to no party, served as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy from 1998 to 2002, when Gerhard Schröder (SPD) was Chancellor. After the 1998 German federal election, Schröder made him minister, after the designated candidate, Jost Stollmann had turned down the position because the responsibilities of the ministry were being reduced. When Oskar Lafontaine resigned in 1999, Müller was also temporarily appointed as the Minister of Finance. Müller worked towards a first nuclear power phase-out ("Ausstieg aus der Atomenergie") in Germany, in negotiations with the industries.
Müller was CEO of the RAG AG, the former Ruhrkohle AG, from 2003. In 2007, the company became Evonik, now with a focus on chemistry, energy and real estate. According to former employer Evonik and German President Horst Köhler, Müller managed a reduction in Germany's dependence on coal ("Ausstieg aus der Kohleenergie") as an energy source, trying to mitigate the issues caused by this fuel, namely damage to the environment and the large subsidies needed in mining, in a socially responsible way. As CEO of the , he organised a reduction of the environmental damage mining had caused. For these activities, "Manager Magazin" selected him as in Germany in 2008. That year, he moved from CEO of Evonik to chairman of its supervisory board. Müller held the same position for Deutsche Bahn from 2005 to 2010.
Müller was a member of the supervisory board of Borussia Dortmund. He was instrumental in the successful application of the Ruhr as European Capital of Culture in 2010, uniting the region.
Müller was married; he and his wife Marion had two children. In April 2018, he received the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia for his life's achievements ("für sein Lebenswerk") in the presence of Gerhard Schröder. He resigned from all offices in May 2018, due to his cancer illness. He died in Essen on 15 July 2019.
Legacy.
In his laudatio for Müller in 2009, awarding the Great Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany, President Horst Köhler focused on Müller's ability to speak the language of both politics and economy, and enable dialogue between them. In the matter of nuclear power phase-out, he managed to represent the voters' wishes even though they were not his own view, and he always held constructive discussions with people representing different positions and interests. Köhler mentioned Müller's competence, calm manner, equanimity and dependability. In turning away from coal mining, he created a model of a socially responsible structural transition, with patience and tenacity.
After his death, Schröder acknowledged Müller as a great economic leader who knew the rules of the game of both business and politics, which enabled him to turn opponents to partners. Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, noted Müller's enormous expertise, dry humour and calm manner, achieving invaluable benefits for the German miners. Armin Laschet (CDU, Minister-president of North Rhine-Westphalia, called him a visionary, and the founding of the RAG-Stiftung "a genuine work of the century" ("ein echtes Jahrhundertwerk").

Early life.
de Grey was baptised on 13 August 1680, the eldest surviving son of William de Grey and his wife Elizabeth Bedingfield, daughter of Thomas Bedingfield of Darsham. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds Grammar School, and was admitted at St John's College, Cambridge on 18 May 1697, aged17. By a marriage settlement dated 10 September 1706, he married with £4,500, Elizabeth Windham, daughter of William Windham of Felbrigg, Norfolk. His marriage brought him into connection with many Norfolk Whig families, although his father was a Tory.
Career.
de Grey was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Thetford at the 1708 British general election. He supported the naturalization of the Palatines in 1709, and voted for the impeachment of Dr Sacheverell in 1710. He did not stand at the 1710 British general election, possibly on grounds of cost, and at the 1713 British general election, declined an invitation by Robert Walpole to stand for Norfolk.
At the 1715 British general election, de Grey was backed by Lord Townshend as a Whig candidate for Norfolk and he won the contest. He voted against the septennial bill of 1716 and joined the opposition (led by Townshend and Robert Walpole) against Lord Cadogan in June 1717. He abstained from the votes on the Peerage Bill and on repealing the Occasional Conformity Act and Schism Act, all in 1719. He did not want to stand again at the 1722 British general election, writing to Townshend asking:
Townshend did not let him stand down and he won the seat unopposed, but never stood again.
Death and legacy.
de Grey died in 1765 and was buried at Merton on 18 December 1765. By his wife, he had two daughters and two surviving sons, Thomas and William.

Songs from the Village

Songs from the Village is the second studio album by Jess &amp; Matt. The album features 12 classic songs that defined a generation in the 1960s in Greenwich Village, New York.
Matt Price said: "It's 50, almost 60 years later, and these songs are just as influential as ever, and a lot of the messages – in songs like "The Times They Are a-Changin" – calling for equality, in this modern world it feels more relevant than ever. It was interesting coming back to those songs and seeing how they stood the test of time, and that the messages have come back around."
The album was announced on 14 November 2017 alongside the album's pre-order and the announcement of a national tour with Rick Price and Jack Jones.
Reception.
David from auspOp said; "Most songs on this collection sit in the “classics” category... [and] to take them on is a challenge in itself, but to do so well is the other half of the battle." adding "Jess &amp; Matt to do a really good job." David said "Matt's vocals dominate the majority of songs but it relegates Jess almost to backing vocalist duties on several songs.". He called out "The Sound of Silence" as the album highlight.

Lewis Bush (photographer)

"For other people, see Louis Bush (disambiguation)"
Lewis K. Bush (born 1988) is a British photographer, writer, curator and educator. He aims "to draw attention to forms of invisible power that operate in the world", believing that "power is always problematic" because it is inherently "arbitrary and untransparent".
Bush's "The Memory of History" (2012), is about Europe's forgetfulness of its unresolved past and that past's re-emergence, as evidenced in the time of the European debt crisis; "The Camera Obscured" (2012) is about the absurdity of security guards preventing people from photographing buildings; "Metropole" (2015) is "an architectural critique on the changing face of London"; "A Model Continent" (2016) is about the current state of the European Union and about its history being reduced to a tourist spectacle; "War Primer 3" (2013) is a reworking of Broomberg and Chanarin's book "War Primer 2;" and "Shadows of the State" (2018) is about numbers stations. All are self-published apart from "Shadows of the State" and the 2018 version of "Metropole." "The Memory of History" and "Metropole" have been shown in solo exhibitions in London.
From 2011 to 2016 he wrote and edited a blog about photography, "Disphotic."
Life and work.
Bush was born in 1988 in London. He studied history at the University of Warwick and gained a master's degree in documentary photography from London College of Communication (LCC). He lectures on photojournalism and documentary photography at LCC.
From 2011 to 2016 he wrote and edited a blog about photography, "Disphotic." Its tagline was "Exploring photography and it's [sic] intersections with journalism, art, and history."
In 2012, for "The Memory of History" (2012), Bush travelled through ten European Union countries to examine the effects of the European debt crisis, in the context of Europe's turbulent history of crises that are forgotten, only later to resurface. Bush intends to show that process happening again, where unresolved history is reappearing "with the economic pain of the present", using photographs that show "connections between history and the present".
For "The Camera Obscured" (2012) he set up a camera obscura outside sensitive sites around London and used it to draw them until challenged by security guards. Bush "attempted to engage these personnel in a discussion about art history, highlighting the blurred boundaries between images made by mechanical means and those drawn by hand, and by doing so demonstrating the absurdity of their objections." The work is also about "the intersections of art and photography, and the question of where the balance lies between individual rights and collective security."
His "War Primer 3" (2013 and 2018) is a reworking of Broomberg and Chanarin's "War Primer 2" (2011), itself an appropriation of Bertolt Brecht's pacifist book "War Primer" (1955). Brecht's book was a "critique of the relationship between war and photography", using photographs and poems; Bush's ebook, in critiquing Broomberg and Chanarin's book, is about "inequality, labour and capital." The title recalls a primer, a first textbook for teaching of reading.
His "Metropole" (2015) zine is "an architectural critique on the changing face of London", "intended to highlight how large swathes of the city are being developed so quickly that they have become unrecognisable – a move he believes is aggressively wiping out London's history and diversity."
His "Shadows of the State" (2018) is a book about numbers stations, that "seeks to visualise, locate and expose many of these stations". It is about the "line of reasoning [. . . ] that the only way to defend democracy is by having something inherently undemocratic at its core." Rather than taking photographs, Bush collated write-ups, publicly available satellite imagery, spectrograms and maps.
During the UK's first COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, Bush forensically exposed and photographed fingerprints present on goods he bought in shops and online. The work is about the potential for contamination of consumers with SARS-CoV-2. It is also about exposing the presence of the usually hidden labourers, vulnerable because of working in distribution at a time of social distancing.

Flute Sonata No. 4 (Ries)

The Flute Sonata in G major, Op. 87 , is a composition for piano and flute by Ferdinand Ries that was published at The Regents Harmonic Institution in London in 1819. Little information about the works composition history is known as the composers manuscript is undated, but Alan Bradly in the preface to the score published by Artaria Editions indicates that the work may have been composed around 1815 along with a number of other works for the same instrumental combination.
Structure.
The work is in three movements:
Unlike the composers earlier Clarinet sonata, this work was written for the amateur market with the piano dominating the thematic material while the flute provides accompaniment. The original publication noted that the composer had prepared alternate passages for the piano allowing the piece to be performed without the flute.

Emer Colleran

Emer Colleran (12 October 1945 – 30 June 2018) was an Irish microbiologist, academic and an environmental advocate. She was professor of microbiology at the National University of Ireland, Galway, a member of the Royal Irish Academy, one of Mary Robinson's nominees on the Council of State, and chairwoman of An Taisce - the National Trust for Ireland.
Birth and education.
Colleran, and her twin Noreen, were born in Ballinrobe, Co Mayo in October 1945 to John and Josie Colleran. One of a family of five children, her father was a school principal and her mother, also a primary school teacher, died when she was just 11 years old. She completed her secondary education at St Louis secondary school in Kiltimagh. She spent a lot of time outdoors as a child, particularly fishing, which sparked her interest in the environment.
On entering higher education, she had a grant from the Department of Education, which required that she had to do her studies through the Irish language. Her first choice, Medicine, was not available through Irish so she chose Science. She graduated with a first class primary degree in Science at University College Galway (now National University of Ireland, Galway) in 1967.
She specialised in anaerobic digestion as a postgraduate and in 1971 became a postdoctoral fellow for two years at the University of Bristol in the UK.
Academic career.
Colleran lectured in biology at Athlone Regional Technical College (now AIT) and Galway Regional Technical College (now GMIT) before her appointment as a lecturer in microbiology at NUIG in 1976. She was appointed Associate Professor of microbiology by the Senate of the National University of Ireland in 1990.
She was a member of the university's governing authority for a number of years, but stepped down in May 2000 in connection with the selection procedure for the new university president. In October that year she was appointed professor of microbiology and chair of the department at NUIG.
She was the first director of the Environment Change Institute at NUIG set up under the Higher Education Authority's Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions in 2000.
Environmentalist.
In 1973 Colleran was elected to the committee of the Galway Association of An Taisce, part of a national voluntary organisation the aims of which were to conservation in Ireland through education, publicity and positive action. She served as membership secretary and then treasurer to the Galway branch before becoming chairman. In 1981, as chairman of the Galway branch, she hit back at claims from Galway County Council that An Taisce were "an anonymous group, wielding power unfairly". She was involved in the compilation of a controversial planning report, published by An Taisce in 1983, which highlighted abuse of planning laws by city and county councillors across Ireland, and in particular in counties Galway, Mayo, Donegal, Kerry and Louth.
She served as Environmental Officer for An Taisce before being elected National Chairman in 1987, the first time a chairman had come from one of the western county associations. She continued to use her position to campaign against misuse of planning laws, for a clamp down on pollution of rivers and lakes, and against a move to scrap An Foras Forbartha, a body that provided independent monitoring of pollution. During her three years as chairman, until May 1990, she was particularly involved in debates over local environmental and planning issues, in particular over gold mining in the west of Ireland, a proposed airport for Clifden, and the planned sewage treatment plant at Mutton Island in Galway.
In 1991 plans were announced for a new visitor centre, to be located at Mullaghmore in The Burren. Colleran was among those who were part of an appeal, saying that while the plan for the national park was welcomed by An Taisce, they wanted the visitor centre to be located three or four miles from Mullaghmore.
Appointments and honours.
President Mary Robinson appointed seven new members to her Council of State in February 1991, including Colleran. Other new members appointed at the time were Monica Barnes, Patricia O'Donovan, Quintan Oliver, Rosemarie Smith, Dónal Toolan and D. Kenneth Whitaker. The new Council of State represented a wide spectrum of Irish life and was widely welcomed, although Fine Gael was disappointed that its leader John Bruton was not included.
In 1991, she was one of 15 people appointed to Taoiseach Charles Haughey's Green 2000 Advisory Group, to determine which problems would face the environment in the next century. The group was led by Dr David Cabot, special advisor on environmental affairs.
She was appointed a member of the National Heritage Council in 1995 by the then Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Michael D. Higgins. In the same year the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, Eamon Gilmore, appointed her to the chair of the Sea Trout working group to oversee the implementation of recommendations to tackle a decline in sea trout stocks, particularly in the west of Ireland.
In 2003 Colleran was elected as member of the Royal Irish Academy.
She was recognised at the annual NUI Galway Alumni Awards in 2004 when she received the award for Natural Science, sponsored by Seavite Bodycare Ltd., which acknowledges a graduate who has made an outstanding contribution in the field of natural science.
Later life and death.
Colleran died on 30 June 2018 at University Hospital Galway.

Wapous River

The Wapous River is a tributary of the Gouin Reservoir, flowing in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in Quebec, in Canada.
The Wapous River flows in the townships of Lindsay, Berlinguet, and Déziel, almost at the north-eastern limit of the territory of La Tuque and near the boundary of the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
A forest road branch serves the upper part of this watercourse. This road branch connects with route 212 which bypasses the Gouin Reservoir by the north-east and connects the village of Obedjiwan, Quebec and La Tuque.
The surface of the Wapous River is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is generally from early December to late March.
Toponymy.
Formerly, this watercourse has been designated "Black Castor River".
The toponym "Wapous River" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

Armory Square Hospital

The Armory Square Hospital formally known as the District Armory or Armory of the District of Columbia was a military hospital for the Union Army located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., which operated from 1862 to 1865. It stood at the intersection of 6th Street SW and B Street SW (now Independence Avenue) between the Smithsonian Castle and the Capitol. The 12 wards extended across the Mall, all the way to the Canal. Today, the National Air and Space Museum stands in its place.
History.
The Armory.
On March 11, 1856, President Franklin Pierce sent a message to the Senate Committee on Military Affairs with information regarding a suitable location for an Armory for "the preservation of ordnance, arms, etc., in Washington". The report was passed from the Ordnance Officer to Secretary of War Jefferson Davis and then to the President. Five sites were analysed and the second one was recommended.
The next site examined was at the intersection of B street south and Sixth street west, north of the former street and west of the latter. Situated at a nearly central point, the ground was "level and firm enough for building on" with easy access from other parts of the city and "ample space on the government reservation contiguous to the site not only for future extension of the building, but for military parade grounds, with little hazard of these two advantages of space being trenched upon by other improvements."
Based on these recommendations, the Armory was built that same year next to the canal.
The Hospital.
Following the American Civil War's 1861 beginning, President Abraham Lincoln asked Doctor Willard Bliss to organize a system of hospitals in and around the city of Washington, D.C. Among the facilities which resulted from this directive were several facilities which were built in or near Washington, D.C., including the Armory Square Hospital, which was built on the land surrounding the city's Armory in 1862.
It offered 1,000 beds in twelve wards (barracks) and overflow tents to treat the wounded from the battlefields of Virginia. Wounded soldiers were brought across the Potomac River to the city wharves in southwest Washington, D.C., including the Fish Wharf as well as on the Long Bridge which landed at the other end of Maryland Avenue SW a few blocks away. In addition to these barracks, quarters for officers, service facilities and a chapel were built on site.
The closest to the arrival points for the steamboats of all of the Washington, D.C.-based Union Army hospitals, it became the treatment facility where the gravely wounded remained, receiving end-of-life care if terminally ill or undergoing additional surgeries or other types of treatment until well enough to be shipped home or moved to a hospital farther away from the war. Volunteers from the northern States came to provide assistance in the hospitals including the Armory as nurses as well as support staff. Dr. Bliss became the superintendent for the hospital and remained to practice in the city after the war.
Among those volunteers was poet Walt Whitman, who had made his way from New York to Washington, D.C., after reading that his brother might have been wounded. After finding his brother and learning that he had sustained only a minor injury, Whitman realized the depth of suffering that other less fortunate soldiers were enduring, and began volunteering as part of the Christian Commission in the city hospitals, visiting wounded soldiers and developing close relationships with many of them and raising money for provisions for them. This experience would have a profound influence on him and his later writings. In "The Wound Dresser", he wrote:
"I devote myself much to Armory-square hospital because it contains by far the worst cases, most repulsive wounds, has the most suffering and most need of consolation. I go every day without fail, and often at night – sometimes stay very late."
Close to the White House, the Armory hospital was visited by President Lincoln in 1863, as reported by Amanda Akin Stearns in her memoir, "The lady nurse of Ward E", which was published in 1909:
"It was pathetic to see him pass from bed to bed and give each occupant the warm, honest grasp for which he is noted. I hear that he is especially interested in this hospital, and has suggested having flower beds made between the wards with plants from the Government gardens, which Dr. Bliss is having done. His homely face with such sad eyes and ungainly figure did not fill my youthful idea of a "President of the United States"; but it was a grand thing for him to come and cheer our soldier boys with his presence." 
Hospital chaplains also worked to ease the suffering of wounded soldiers, dispensing books and other reading materials, as well as words of comfort and advice. The first issue of the "Armory Square Hospital Gazette" was published on January 6, 1864. In an article entitle "Salutatory", the publisher wrote: "the hospital is an episode in soldier's life—sometimes a painful termination of it, which has many an event worthy of a chronicle. Such we propose this paper to be.
The "Gazette" went on for several months, offering reading and news updates to patients and recognition staff for their service. The last issue was published on the 21 August 1865. With hostilities ended following the Surrender at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, and the resulting decline in the number of patients being sent to Union Army hospitals, military leaders determined that the Armory hospital was no longer needed and was closed during the summer of 1865. The last edition of the hospital newspaper, which was published on 21 August 1865, offered the following reflection:
"During the last three years, thousands of our brave soldiers have been inmates of Armory Square [...] One cannot conceive of a gun-shot wound that has not been treated here. Of nearly every disease in the catalogue we have had examples. Such an opportunity for the practice of surgery, or the study of pathology and the treatment of disease, will not probably occur again soon. God grant that the stern emergency of a bloody civil war, which rendered so many asylums for our wounded and sick soldiers a necessity, may never again arise to curse with its mildew blights our native land.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
"We now bid adieu to Armory Square—but not without some regrets [...] Within its walls we have learned many a lesson of wisdom, of patience under suffering—of the keenest grief—of faith, forgiveness, of true manhood."The hospital buildings north of the Armory began to be demolished in 1867, although the Armory building itself remained in use. By 1873 landscaping of the area as part of the Armory Square portion of the National Mall began.
Later history.
The Armory Building was used for a time as a storage facility until the Smithonian Arts and Industries Building was constructed. During 1881–1932 it served as the United States Fish Commission headquarters. A series of temporary buildings of the National Mall existed alongside the building beginning in 1918. Finally in January 1964, it was demolished to make way for the National Air and Space Museum.

Grigory Petrovich Nikulin (Russian: Григо́рий Петро́вич Нику́лин; 10 January 1895 [O.S. 27 December 1894] - 22 September 1965) was a Russian Bolshevik revolutionary best known for taking part in the execution of the Emperor Nicholas II of Russia, his family and four others on the night of 16 July 1918.
Early life.
Nikulin was born and raised in Zvenigorodka, Kiev province, Russian Empire. He came from a lower-class family. His father Pyotr Iossiffovich (Пётр Иосифович) was a bricklayer and mother Anna Ivanovna a housewife. At the age of 9 Grigory started attending parish school at Zvenigorod church, which he enjoyed immensely. Education was interrupted by his family's disastrous financial situation. After which he started working in a local blacksmith shop. In the spring of 1909 family sold their house in Zvenigorodka and moved to a nearby small town of Uman. At the age of 16 Grigory moved out of parent's house and became a bricklayer. He joined a local social democratic club in Uman in 1913. Soon he was deported from Kiev province and moved to Kazan.
Joining the Bolsheviks.
In January 1915 he was drafted into the Imperial army, but due to congenital diseases was only fit for wartime militia units and not for regular service. Early in 1916 Grigory moved to Tavatui near Yekaterinburg and started working at the construction site of the dynamite plant (Таватуйский динамитный завод). Very soon after moving he was drawn to local Bolsheviks and met Mikhail Kabanov who helped him become a devoted follower of Lenin. By the end of 1916 he was organizing a strike at the dynamite plant. In March 1917 Nikulin became a member of the Bolshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (RSDLP). The number of his party membership was 128185. 
As a result of financing problems with French joint-stock company, plant activists decided to stop all work with the construction of this facility early in 1918. Nikulin was sent to Yekaterinburg along with all the party members of the factory. He met Goloschekin, a member of the Ural Regional Committee of the RSDLP and joined the Ural Cheka on his recommendation. Starting his service in Cheka, Nikulin soon became acquainted with Yakov Yurovsky who noticed Nikulin's modesty, ability to get along with different people, honesty and absolute sobriety. The two became friends and formed a special relationship that lasted for years where Yurovsky simply called him "son". Nikulin was appointed Assistant to the Commandant of the House of Special Purpose on the recommendation of Yurovsky. The Commandant was Yurovsky himself.
Yekaterinburg Cheka.
Having begun work in the Cheka, Grigory was assigned some serious cases. One of the first was discrete surveillance of Alexander Ivanovich Andogsky, the head of the Military Academy of Workers' and Peasants' Red Army. Nikulin was introduced as a domestic worker to Andogsky after the Academy was evacuated from Petrograd to Yekaterinburg in March 1918. Later the same year Andogsky joined the White forces, was dismissed from the Military Academy and eventually was appointed as General in Kolchak's Army.
Nikulin was also in charge of soldier selection for train convoy L-42, on 30 April 1918 where Tsar Nicholas II and part of his family were moved from Tyumen to Yekaterinburg.
Killing of Prince Dolgorukov.
Execution of Prince Vasily Alexandrovich Dolgorukov. Dolgorukov was a close friend of Nicholas II as well as his adviser, Marshal of the Imperial Court (1914–1917) and Commander of the Imperial Guard cavalry regiment. Deeply devoted to the Tsar he voluntarily accompanied the Imperial family to imprisonment in Tobolsk. After arriving in Yekaterinburg at the end of May he was separated from the family and arrested. Dolgorukov was executed 10 July 1918 in cold blood by Nikulin, a week before the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Dolgorukov was taken to a field beyond the city's Ivanovskoe Cemetery with Count Tatishchev and the two were shot in the head and thrown into a pit. Nikulin recalled the incident in his radio interview 1964: "Я вывез его в поле и проклял всё пока тащил чемоданы назад" (I took him out to the field and cursed everything while I was dragging his suitcases back). Dolgorukov was canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church in 1981.
Nikulin was also involved in death of Hermogenes, Bishop of Tobolsk and Siberia, who was drowned in the Tura River by the Bolsheviks.
Killing of Nicholas II and family.
Grigory Nikulin is known for his participating in the killing of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. Nikulin was living in the House of Special Purpose Ipatiev House since his appointment as Assistant to the Commandant. He was also in charge of the house in absence of Yurovsky who lived in the "American Hotel". The Ural Regional Soviet agreed in a meeting on June 29 that the Romanov family should be executed. After getting the final approval from the Central Executive Committee in Moscow Yurovsky organized a meeting in American Hotel. Participation in the killing was voluntary and people who agreed to participate came to Yurovsky's room. It was agreed that to prevent unnecessary suffering that the condemned were to be shot in the heart.
On 17 July, right after midnight Yurovsky woke up the Tsar, his family, doctor and servants, 11 persons altogether and guided them to an empty room in the lower floor of the house. On demand of Tsaritsa Alexandra Nikulin brought two chairs. One for her and one for Prince Alexei. Yurovsky announced the verdict: "Nikolai Alexandrovich, in view of the fact that your relatives are continuing their attack on Soviet Russia, the Ural Executive Committee has decided to execute you." Shooting started. It is controversial who actually shot the Tsar – Yurovsky, Medvedev, Ermakov, or all of them. Nikulin shot one bullet to Prince Alexei and left the room. Apparently Alexei didn't die from this shot. Yurovsky shot Alexei in the head killing him. Long after this event, in private conversation with the son of Mikhail Medvedev, Nikulin said that he couldn't bear having the sick boy looking at him and stopped shooting.
Afterwards Nikulin oversaw the carrying of the corpses to a truck waiting outside. He had all the jewels and valuables that had been sewn into the clothes of the royal family removed. On 20 July, just a few days before the arrival of the White Army, Nikulin left Yekaterinburg. He personally carried 6,000 carats of the Tsar's diamonds to the State Bank in Moscow.
Nikulin initially left a good impression on the Imperial family during visits to the Ipatiev House with Yurovsky. He wasn't like the others. He was well-mannered and polite. From the diary of Alexandra Feodorovna: "June 21st, Thursday. "..young assistant, who seems very nice person, compared to other ones that are vulgar and unpleasant.. Young man (Nikulin) enumerated jewelry items and did it thoroughly". From the diary of Nicholas II: "June 23th, Saturday. Yurovsky and his assistant (Nikulin) started to understand what sort of people was around, stealing from us and guarded us from them". However, after Yurovsky became commandant of the Ipatiev House on 4 July and continuously tightened restrictions imposed on the Romanov family, Nicholas wrote in his diary on 11 July, "We like this man less and less."
After Yekaterinburg.
After completing the assignment in Yekaterinburg, Nikulin joined the Red Army. He had several duties at 3rd Army of the Eastern front. He even took part in battles. Early 1919 he started working for political department of the division (politotdel) but contracted typhus and was taken to Moscow. There he met again Yurovsky, who worked for Moscow City Council at the time and offered him a job as head of the Moscow apartment houses. They continued their warm friendship meeting each other on and off duty.
Nikulin stayed in Moscow and worked in different jobs. First for City Council (MosSoviet). Later he was allocated to the position of Moscow prisons head. Four months after that the head of inspectorate department of Moscow police. He then worked as the head of Moscow Criminal Investigation Department from March 1920 to 1922. In 1922 he was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner.
Later life.
Between 1923 and 1938 Nikulin held several noteworthy positions. From 1923 to 1924 he was Vice-head of the Moscow Criminal Investigation Department. In 1925 he was a member of MosGorIspolCom (Moscow Executive Committee). From 1925 to 1930 he was the head of MosGubStrakh (Moscow Insurance State Company). From 1930 to 1931 he was the head of MosGas (Moscow Gas trest). From 1933 to 1935 he worked at MosSovet on a problem concerning building materials manufacturing, and from 1935 to 1938 he was the head of MosZhilOtdel (Moscow Housing Department).
He was often visited by comrades such as Rodzinsky and Medvedev. In 1927 Nikulin and Yurovsky made an application to the USSR Revolution Museum and handed them two revolvers which were used in the killing of Imperial Family.
Yurovsky died in 1938. Before dying he wrote a warm farewell letter to his dear friend Nikulin leaving him a list of documents to be delivered to the Revolution Museum. From 1938 to his retirement in 1960 Nikulin worked for Department of Water and Sewerage. He was awarded with four state orders, one of which was Order of the Patriotic War 1st class (1947). During his whole life Nikulin insisted on keeping low profile concerning the killing of imperial family. He even asked Medvedev not to mention his role in the execution. One year before his death he was asked by a high party official to give an interview on radio. It resulted in a 3 hour recording in which he talks about everything. "All was done consciously, without doubts. I did understand all responsibility. I welcomed the decision of Ural Regional Soviet.. And even more, if it is allowed to say, I considered it as an honor."
Grigory Nikulin died on 22 September 1965. He was buried on the site of the "Old Bolsheviks" at Novodevichy Cemetery in Moscow. Across from Nikulin's grave is the grave of Boris Yeltsin, President of the Russian Federation. Ipatiev House was demolished by order of Boris Yeltsin in 1977 while he was leader of the Sverdlovsk Executive Committee. The Politburo had declared the house not to be of "sufficient historical significance".

Girona History museum

The Girona City History Museum is a museum in the middle of the Old Town of Girona, in a unique building which used to be the convent of the Capuchin friars of Saint Anthony in 18th century, and which still conserves some surprising remnants of the time, such as the cemetery, cloister and cistern.
The Museum features displays showing how Girona was founded, from the Roman period through to the transition to democracy, all in chronological order. Several subject areas are covered, including an exhibition dedicated to popular imagery in the city and a room dedicated to the Sardana (a type of circle dance typical of Catalan culture) and the Cobla (a music ensemble).
The Museum exhibition spaces are located in the main building and in other areas dedicated to the Spanish Civil War, part of the Democratic Memory Spaces Network of Catalonia. These include the air-raid shelter in the 'Jardi de la Infància', the provincial prison and the common grave in the old cemetery.
The Museum offers a varied programme of activities, and temporary exhibitions are held in different areas within the museum: in the exhibition hall, the coal room, the cistern and the cellar.

New Year's Day (Taylor Swift song)

"New Year's Day" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her sixth studio album "Reputation" (2017). The song was released to US country radio on November 27, 2017, as a single from the album. Prior to the release, Swift premiered a recorded live performance of the song on the television series "Scandal" on November 9, and performed the song live on "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" on November 13, 2017.
Written and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff, "New Year's Day" is an acoustic piano ballad with delicate piano riffs and occasional guitar and synth harmonies, a stark contrast with "Reputation" heavy synth-laden electronic production. The lyrics find Swift singing about sharing her innermost vulnerability with her lover, who together clean up their shared house and care for each other the morning after a New Year's Eve party.
Contemporary critics lauded the song's acoustic production and Swift's intricate lyrics, which they considered a sign of Swift's artistic maturity. Some also commented that its position as the last track on "Reputation" serves as an appropriate closing theme of love and vulnerability against the album's dramatic themes. Commercially, "New Year's Day" appeared at lower-tier positions on "Billboard" charts including the Country Airplay, Hot Country Songs, and Canada Country charts. It also charted on Belgium's Ultratip chart.
Production and writing.
Taylor Swift wrote and produced "New Year's Day" with Jack Antonoff for her sixth studio album, "Reputation" (2017). For his recording sessions with Swift, Antonoff encouraged her to capture emotions at a particular time, when "you can feel like you can conquer the world, or you can feel like the biggest piece of garbage that ever existed". He said that "New Year's Day" was the fastest song to complete on "Reputation", as the two recorded "scratch takes" that did not filter out unwanted sounds from the outside environment. In an interview with "Entertainment Weekly", Antonoff recalled that the recording session was inspired by singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell for capturing emotional honesty: "You don't want to get the perfect tune. You don't want to get the absolute perfect vocal take or the perfect panning or compression. ... It has nothing to do with genre, or how loud or soft it is. You just want the song to feel like itself."
The inspiration for the song's lyrics came from a New Year's Eve party at Swift's residence in London. She said, "I was thinking about how everybody talks and thinks about who you kiss at midnight [...] But I think there's something even more romantic about who's gonna deal with you on New Year's Day. Who's willing to give you Advil and clean up the house? I think that states more of a permanence."
Composition.
"New Year's Day" is a piano ballad featuring a stripped-down production incorporating raw piano sounds and occasional guitar and slight synth harmonies, a stark contrast to "Reputation" synth-heavy electronic production. Lyrically consistent with Swift's themes of capturing temporary feelings at a particular moment, "New Year's Day" has a setting of a New Year's Eve house party that has just ended. Swift observes, "There's glitter on the floor after the party," as barefoot girls carry their shoes through the lobby, and there is candle wax on the hardwood floor. After all of her friends have gone home, Swift tells her lover, "Don't read the last page, but I stay / When it's hard and it's wrong and we're making mistakes," and confesses that she "wants [his] midnights". Swift sings, "Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you," and begs for her lover to not "become a stranger whose laugh [she] could recognize anywhere".
Release.
"New Year's Day" is the last track on the track listing of "Reputation", which was released worldwide on November 10, 2017. Prior to the album's release, Swift premiered a recorded live performance of the song on the ABC series "Scandal", broadcast on November 9, 2017. The performance had taken place at Swift's Holiday House in Watch Hill, Rhode Island in October 2017, as part of a fan-exclusive "Reputation" album-listening session. On November 13, 2017, Swift performed "New Year's Day" during an episode of "The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon" in tribute to host Jimmy Fallon's recently passed mother.
Big Machine Records promoted "New Year's Day" to US country radio on November 15, 2017, as a promotional single. The label then officially released the song to US country radio stations on November 27, 2017, after positive feedback from several country radio stations regarding Swift's performance on the "Tonight Show". Reaction to the song's country airplay was mixed, given Swift's announcement that she had abandoned her country roots to embrace mainstream pop in 2014. Radio stations including Chicago's WUSN and Houston's KKBQ, who lobbied to get the song played at their station, were receptive of "New Year's Day". Other country stations were more reserved; a representative of Massachusetts's WBWL commented: "Essentially, I believe that [Swift] has moved on from the country genre ... As she has moved on, our core country listeners have moved on from [Swift], so I'll lay off of it for now. ... and it's not fair to add a pop song when great artists are waiting their turn."
"New Year's Day" was included on the set list of Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour (2018), which she launched in support of "Reputation". During the concerts, Swift performed the song as part of a mash-up with "Long Live"—a song from her 2010 album "Speak Now"—on a piano. On April 23, 2019, she performed the song at the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts during the "Time" 100 Gala, where she was honored as one of the "100 most influential people" of the year.
American singer-songwriter Olivia Rodrigo interpolated "New Year's Day" on the song "1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back" from Rodrigo's debut album "Sour" (2021). Swift and Antonoff were credited as co-writers on the track.
Critical reception.
"New Year's Day" received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics, who highlighted its acoustic production which contrasts with the generally synth-heavy production of "Reputation", and commended the intricate lyrics. Frank Guan from "New York" said: "'New Year's Day' isn't the best song on "Reputation", but it's one of the best." Guan found the song's theme of vulnerability a much more powerful sentiment than "Reputation" themes of vengeance and stardom, saying that Swift was "still an artistic force to be reckoned with". Zach Schonfeld from "Newsweek" deemed it the best track on "Reputation", writing: "It's gorgeous, more so than the song that has that title." "Pitchfork" Jamieson Cox praised Swift's songwriting for "[conjuring] rich scenes with just a handful of lines". In a review for "Clash", Shahzaib Hussain commended Swift's ability to connect to her audience by expressing "the intimate, diary-like invocation of her past work", a welcoming change from the "high-octane melodrama" of "Reputation".
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic lauded the song as a high mark against the "monochromatic production" of "Reputation" for combining "vulnerability, melody, and confidence, but they are deeply felt and complex", which signified Swift's maturity as a singer-songwriter. Writing for "Spin", Anna Gacca downplayed "Reputation" influences from contemporary hip hop and R&amp;B trends that diminished Swift's authenticity, but found "New Year's Day" to be a welcoming sign of Swift's core as a songwriter: "The Taylor Swift of 'New Year's Day' is ... the sentimentalist who valued songwriting above all else." Gacca also complimented the song's placement as the final track on "Reputation" for breaking free from the album's themes fueled by the tabloid scrutiny that Swift had experienced. In another review of "Reputation" for "Spin", Jordan Sargent similarly lauded the song for reasserting Swift's authenticity as a songwriter, calling it the album's "most placid, calming note".
BBC Music's Will Gompertz praised the song's production for highlighting Swift's vocals, unburdened by heavy electronics: "you hear a singer who can communicate feeling and thought with touching depth and sincerity." Retrospectively, "New York" Nate Jones considered "New Year's Day" the best song on "Reputation". Jane Song from "Paste" noted Swift's lyrical maturity, pointing out similarities between "New Year's Day" and previous songs "Enchanted" and "Mine" from Swift's 2010 album "Speak Now". Rob Sheffield of "Rolling Stone" similarly commented on Swift's maturity: "It captures the romance of mundane domestic details ... This is the kind of song she could keep writing into her forties and fifties."
Commercial performance.
"New Year's Day" debuted at number 40 on the "Billboard" Hot Country Songs chart dated December 9, 2017. It was her 41st chart entry, and her first since her collaboration with Tim McGraw on "Highway Don't Care" in 2013. The same week, it debuted at number five on the "Billboard" Country Digital Song Sales chart, her 33rd top-ten entry. On the "Billboard" Country Airplay chart, the single debuted at number 57, her first chart entry since "Shake It Off" (2014). "New Year's Day" later peaked at number 33 and number 41 on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, respectively. It peaked at number 44 on the "Billboard" Digital Song Sales chart. It also peaked on the "Billboard" Canada Country at number 50 and Belgian Flanders's Ultratip Bubbling Under chart at number 33.

<doc id="56701569" url="?curid=56701569" title="Tenäk Temejĕ">
Tenäk Temejĕ

Tenäk Temejĕ (Chuvash: "Теняк Темейĕ", [teˈnʲak teˈmejɘ]), Russian: Temey Tenyakov) was a Chuvash nobleman and the last native Chuvash to hold the title "pü", which is equivalent to the European prince and the Russian knyaz. His name occurs in financial documents from the 1620s and in Chuvash legends.
The Chuvash feudal system that existed in the Khanate of Kazan was abandoned soon after the Chuvash country was annexed by Russia. A great part of Chuvash aristocracy was killed during the invasion of the Khanate of Kazan by the Muscovites (1545 – 1552) and subsequent uprisings (1552 – 1585). The survivors became vassals of the Russian Tsar and in a short time lost their status as noblemen, their real properties being awarded to Russian landlords and monasteries.
In the 17th century, there still existed a number of Chuvash noblemen of low and middle rank, i.e. sergeants "vunpü", lieutenants "śĕrpü" and tarkhans "turxan" who were equated by the authorities to Russian servicemen. The only high-rank Chuvash nobleman that is mentioned in the contemporary Russian sources is the “knyaz Temey Tenyakov”. In Chuvash system, he held the title "pü", corresponding to Common Turkic beg or bey.
According to Russian documents, on 12 May 1625, the Chuvash knyaz Temey Tenyakov and his companions were granted fields along the Little Autla River (now in Jĕpreś district of Chuvashia) by the voivode of Šupaškar Nikita Likharev. At that time, Tenyakov served as a lieutenant in the Šerdan volost of the Šupaškar uyezd. His residence was located in the village of Măn Pükassi (“Prince's big village” in Chuvash). The location of Tenyakov's residence in Măn Pükassi is further confirmed by Chuvash legends.
In a legend recorded in 1969 in the village of Načar Čemurša, Tenäk Temejĕ is described as a cruel landlord who dispossessed Chuvash peasants of their lands. To escape from his atrocities, all Tatar and almost all Chuvash inhabitants of Načar Čemurša left the village.
In his book “The ancient Chuvashes”, the novelist Juxma Mišši depicts Tenäk Temejĕ as a betrayer of the Chuvash people who assisted the Russian authorities whilst most of his bannermen supported anti-Muscovite resistance movement. However, after a while he repented and joined the Chuvash rebels. He raised an army and took the fortress of Śĕrpü. Then he marched his army to the town of Sĕve but was captured by the Russians. He was enchained and brought to the Tsar. His further fate is unknown

Sir Jacob Astley, 5th Baronet

Lieutenant-colonel Sir Jacob Henry Astley, 5th Baronet (12 September 1756 – 28 April 1817) was an English landowner and Member of Parliament.
Life.
He was the third son of Sir Edward Astley, 4th Baronet of Melton Constable and Rhoda Delaval, daughter of Francis Blake Delaval of Seaton Delaval, Northumberland. He attended Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge.
On 14 January 1789 he married Hester Browne, by whom he had three sons and six daughters. His father Edward was MP for Norfolk for twenty-two years and gave it up in 1790 rather than contest it. Jacob was given a commission as a captain in the East Norfolk Militia in 1780, which he held until 1794, when he was made lieutenant colonel in the Norfolk Fencible Light Dragoons, a role he held for five years. A brother Edward J.Astley was appointed as a major. 
He was on military service in Scotland in 1797 when his mother announced his candidature for one of the seats in his father's old constituency, which had fallen vacant when Sir John Wodehouse was made a peer. The constituency's other MP Thomas William Coke offered him financial help and Astley was returned unopposed, despite Wodehouse threatening to refuse his peerage and remain MP to block his election.
Astley professed neutrality and publicly distanced himself from Coke, but he did vote with the Whigs against William Pitt the Younger's assessed taxes and land tax redemption in late 1797 and early 1798, against the refusal to enter into peace negotiations with France in 1800 and for the censure motion by Grey on 25 March 1801. By his father's death in 1802 both his elder brothers had died and so he inherited the baronetcy and Melton Constable Hall in Norfolk. Again assisted by Coke, his re-election campaign of 1802 was fierce and he was attacked as "a liar, a coward, an assassin, a scoundrel, a murderer; and ...[the murderer of] his own father". He initiated a libel case, though the defence cited his own father's words just before his death and Astley was only awarded a fifth of the £10,000 damages he claimed.
When his mother's brother Edward Hussey Delaval died in 1814 he inherited his estate of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland.
The 1806 election elected Coke and William Windham as the MPs for Norfolk, but on petition this result was declared invalid and in a by-election the following year Coke's younger brother Edward and Astley were elected instead. Astley took leaves of absence in 1815 and 1816 and died in 1817. His eldest son Jacob succeeded him in the baronetcy.

It is a two-and-a-half-story frame house on a brick foundation. It was completed in 1876.
It was deemed notable "as one of the last and certainly the most indentifiable reminders of the brief boom era of the late 19th century which resulted from the attempt to establish an iron industry in the community. This large Victorian house, the most impressive building in Grand Rivers, was constructed as a residence for Thomas Lawson, the developer responsible for the planning and construction associated with the project. Although these plans were ultimately to fail, the period was one of the most historic events in the life of this small Kentucky town."
It was the first building in Grand Rivers to have electric power, and the first to have indoor plumbing.

Microvalve

A microvalve is microscale valve, i.e. a microfluidic two-port component that regulates the flow between two fluidic ports. Microvalves are basic components in microfluidic devices, such as Labs-on-a-chip, where they are used to control the fluidic transport. During the period 1995-2005, a lot of Microelectromechanical systems-based microvalves were developed. 
Microvalves found today can be roughly categorized as "active" microvalves and "passive" microvalves.
Based on the medium they control, microvalves can be divided into gas microvalves and liquid microvalves.
Based on their initial mode, microvalves can be divided into normally open, normally closed and bistable microvalves.
Types of microvalves.
Active microvalves.
Active mechanical microvalves consist of mechanically movable membrane or boss structure, coupled to an actuation method, that can close of an orifice, thus blocking the flow path between the inlet and outlet ports.
The actuator can either be an integrated magnetic, electrostatic, piezoelectric or thermal microactuator, a "smart" phase change, e.g. Shape-memory alloy, or rheological material, or an externally applied actuation mechanism, such as an external magnetic field or pneumatic source.
Passive microvalves.
Passive microvalves are valves for which the operational state, i.e. open or close, is determined by the fluid they control. Most common passive microvalves are flap valves, membrane microvalves and ball microvalves.
Microvalve applications.
Gas Microvalves.
Controlling a gas flow with MEMS microvalves has the following general benefits: the integration of the actuation mechanism with the other microvalve components allows component miniaturization; and the small scale of the component results in a rapid response time and a low-power consumption. However, despite the potential for cost-efficient batch fabrication offered by microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) technologies, gas microvalves have so far failed to reach the critical cost-per-performance ratio needed for a wide adoption of this technology.
Check valves.
Most check valves, are incorporated in inlets and outlets of reciprocal displacement micropumps, where they provide the liquid rectification needed for the valve to have a net pump flow in one direction.

But the greedy Paanakaalu escapes the village, purchases land in the town and informs everyone he is going to Rangoon. Meanwhile, Ranganatham recovers and knows that Paanakaalu is left to Rangoon, so, he too moves in search of his son. After that, Paanakaalu is blessed with a son Mohan, he engages Krishna in the fields and educates Mohan. Years roll by, Paanakaalu becomes rich, Krishna (N. T. Rama Rao) is good natured and loves Lakshmi (Devika), daughter of Paanakaalu's distant relative Naganna. Paanakaalu takes money as dowry in advance from Naganna by fixing Lakshmi's alliance with Mohan (Jaggayya). In the city, Mohan becomes a spoiled brat and also makes cheatings with the help of his friend Platform (Ramana Reddy). He traps a beautiful girl Nirmala (Jayanthi), daughter of a Zamindar (Rajanala) by focusing himself as a millionaire. Parallelly, Paanakaalu learns regarding the love affair of Krishna &amp; Lakshmi, he accuses Krishna and throws him out by revealing his birth secret. At the same time, Paanakaalu knows Mohan loves the Zamindar's daughter of their own village, so, he makes a ploy, sends Lakshmi in search of Krishna, Naganna also follows her and they reach the city. A tea vendor Kanakam (Surabhi Balasaraswathi) gives shelter to Lakshmi. On the other side, Ranganatham returns from Rangoon as a millionaire and still in search of Paanakaalu. Fortunately, Krishna joins as a servant at him. Simultaneously, Mohan makes his marriage arrangements with Nirmala for which Paanakaalu sell his property. During the time of marriage, Nagamma visits and reveals the truth. The Zamindar becomes furious, but for his daughter's sack, he allows Mohan to stay with them and throws away Paanakaalu when he loses a limb and becomes a beggar. Eventually, Platform gets acquaintance with Kanakam and they fell in love. As a coincidence, Ranganatham &amp; the Zamindar are familiar with each other, once he narrates his story, Mohan listens to it and makes a plan. Meantime, Krishna finds his mother, both of them goes for Paanakaalu, by the time, Mohan takes and leaves him far away from the city where Lakshmi &amp; Platform protect him. Now Mohan showcases himself as Ranganathan's son. Overexcited, Ranganatham brings Mohan home where Krishna is shocked to see him and warns Mohan to leave the house until morning. But that night, crooked Mohan tries to kill Ranganatham, Krishna saves him. At last, Paanakaalu arrives, reveals Krishna as his real son, at that moment, Mohan also realizes his mistake.

The next week, the team was blown out 42–13 by Buffalo of the Mid-American Conference. In the remainder of conference play, the Scarlet Knights were mostly outmatched, losing the rest of their games, despite holding fourth quarter leads in games against Northwestern and Michigan State. Rutgers' final record of 1–11 matched the previous school record for losses in a season with their 1–11 2002 team and 0–11 1997 team.
Freshman quarterback Artur Sitowski led the team in passing, finishing with 1,158 passing yards, 4 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions. Sophomore running back Raheem Blacksheer led the team in both rushing and receiving yards, and had 953 yards from scrimmage on the year. On defense, senior linebacker Trevor Morris finished in sixth in the conference with 105 total tackles. He concluded his career in ninth on the school's all-time leaderboard for total tackles.

Murder of Harry and Harriette Moore

Harry T. Moore and his wife, Harriette V. S. Moore, were pioneer activists and leaders of the early Civil Rights Movement in the United States and became the first martyrs of the movement. On the night of Christmas, December 25, 1951, a bomb that had been planted under the bedroom floor of the Moores' home in Mims, Florida, exploded. They had celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary earlier that day. Harry died in the ambulance in transit from the attack, and Harriette died from her injuries nine days later, on January 3, 1952. Their murder was the first assassination of any activist to occur during the Civil Rights Movement and the only time that a husband and wife were murdered during the history of the movement.
Background.
Harry Moore and Harriette Simms married in December 25, 1926 and moved into the Simms' family home the following fall. Harry was an educator, and Harriette was a former teacher turned insurance broker. In 1927, Harry was promoted to the position of principal at the local Titusville Colored School. The city's school system was racially segregated, like many others in the country at the time. Harry taught the school's ninth grade (the school taught grades one to nine), and he also supervised the team of teachers at the school. The school was closed early his first year by the local school board just six months into the year, as part of the local school system's systemic discrimination against black children. The Moores had their first daughter in 1928 and moved into their own home with an acre of land given to them by Harriette's parents. They gave birth to their second daughter in 1930. Harriette returned to her career in education the following year and later began working as a teacher for the same school as Harry.
In 1934, Harry founded the Brevard County, Florida, National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) chapter. He later served as the NAACP's first Executive Secretary in the state of Florida. The NAACP chapter worked towards achieving equal pay for equal work for teachers of any race, fought to get lynchings prosecuted, and attempted to register black voters in the region.
Moore's activism was highly controversial in the local white-dominated county. In 1946, it resulted in the firings of Harry and Harriette from their teaching jobs by state authorities. Harry then became a full-time employee of the NAACP.
Murder.
On the night of December 25, 1951, the Moores finished celebrating Christmas and their 25th wedding anniversary. When they later retired to their bedroom for the evening, a bomb exploded, injuring Harry and Harriette but leaving their daughter (who was at home at the time, the other being in a different location) unharmed. The improvised explosive device, which was made from dynamite, had been placed directly under the Moores' bedroom floor. The Moores were rushed to the nearest hospital that would treat African-Americans in Sanford, Florida, a drive by car. Harry died while being transported; his wife, Harriette, lived to see her husband buried before she died nine days later from her injuries.
Investigations and motive.
Over the years, a number of motives have been suggested for the Moores' murders. All of them share a common theme — retribution against Harry Moore for his civil rights activities. 
Since the night of the explosion in 1951, five separate criminal investigations have been initiated and completed. The first investigation was headed by the FBI, began on the night of the explosion, and concluded in 1955. The second investigation was a joint investigation by the Brevard County Sheriff's Office and Brevard County State Attorney's Office in 1978. The third investigation took place in 1991 by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE). In 2004, a fourth investigation was commenced by the Florida Attorney General's Office of Civil Rights. In 2008, the FBI again investigated the Moore homicides as part of the Department of Justice's "Cold Case Initiative".
In total, the five criminal investigations revealed evidence implicating four subjects in the bombing. The four subjects were known to be high-ranking members within the Ku Klux Klan in the central region of Florida. The first of the four, Earl J. Brooklyn, was a Klansman with a reputation for being exceedingly violent and described as "a renegade" after being expelled from a Klavern of the Ku Klux Klan in Georgia for engaging in unsanctioned acts of violence. Brooklyn reportedly was in possession of floor plans of the Moore home and was said to be recruiting volunteers to assist in the bombing. The second subject, Tillman H. "Curley" Belvin, was also reported to be a violent member of the Klan and a close friend of Brooklyn. Joseph Cox, another Klansman, was implicated in the bombing by a fellow Klansman, Edward L. Spivey. Spivey implicated Cox in a deathbed confession while he suffered in the late stages of cancer in 1978. Cox committed suicide in 1952, one day after he was confronted by the FBI. Both Brooklyn and Belvin died while the FBI’s initial investigation was being conducted. Belvin died of natural causes in August 1952. Brooklyn died of natural causes on Christmas Day 1952, one year to the day after the bombing. 
The investigation revealed that Harry's civil rights advocacy made him a known target of the Klan. No arrests were ever made in the case. All four of the subjects are now deceased. The Department of Justice Civil Rights Division closed the file on the federal investigation in 2011.
Public reaction.
During the early morning hours of the following day, December 26, 1951, angry men in Titusville's black neighborhoods were in the streets spreading word of the bombing. In the following hours men and women from Brevard County, still in their nightclothes, walked and rode towards Mims to protest in the streets. Most of the people knew Moore personally, some via his job in education, others via the NAACP, and still others through his registration drives.
The assassination triggered nationwide protests, with rallies, memorials, and other events held following the news of the bombing. President Harry S Truman and Governor Fuller Warren both received a high volume of telegrams and letters in protest of the murder of the civil rights activists in Mims, Florida. In New York City, a few weeks later on January 5, 1952, Jackie Robinson held a memorial service drawing approximately 3,000 mourners. The NAACP held a memorial service, in March 1952 in the Madison Square Garden that was attended by 15,000 people, and speakers like Langston Hughes had come to give their respects.
&lt;poem&gt;
And this he says, our Harry Moore
As from the grave he cries
No bomb can kill the dreams I hold
For freedom never dies!"
&lt;/poem&gt;
 — Langston Hughes, (1951)
Awards and tributes.
In 1952, the year following the Moore's murders, Harry was posthumously awarded the NAACP's Spingarn Medal. In 1999, the site of the Moore's home in Mims, Florida, where the bombing occurred became an Historical Heritage Landmark of the State of Florida. Five years later, Brevard County's local government christened the "Harry T. and Harriette Moore Memorial Park and Interpretive Center."

Thomas Sowler

Sir Thomas Sowler (7 July 1818 – 4 April 1891) was an English newspaper proprietor in Manchester.
Early life.
Thomas Sowler was born in Manchester to Thomas and Helen Sowler, one of three sons and three daughters. He bore the same name as his father, who in common with his grandfather, had been a printer. The family claimed descent from a Baron Sowler of Normandy and carried on their business initially at Hunt's Bank and later in St Ann's Square, both in Manchester.
Thomas Sowler senior established the "Manchester Courier" newspaper in 1825 and upon his death the business was passed to Thomas junior, who had been educated at Manchester Grammar School, and another son, John.
Career.
The brothers sold the book-selling part of their father's business and in 1864 converted the newspaper from a weekly to a daily publication, eventually expanding it from the then common four-page format to one that had twelve or more pages. John died in 1871, leaving Thomas as the sole proprietor of the Conservative Party-supporting organ. In 1874, Sowler established the "Manchester Evening Mail" and in 1889 he was appointed as the first president of the restructured National Association of Journalists.
Sowler was a director of the Manchester Royal Exchange and on the board of several other businesses, as well as being involved with other institutions such as the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society and the Manchester Natural History Society. He was also a co-founder of the Manchester Free Library and the first secretary of the Manchester branch of the Church Defence Association.
Away from business, Sowler was involved with the military from the time of the "Defence not Defiance" movement in the 1860s. He joined the 19th Lancashire Volunteer Artillery as a gunner and rose through the ranks to become Lieutenant-Colonel in command of the regiment. In 1874, he resigned from that position and soon after was appointed as successor to the recently dead John Isaac Mawson, who had been Honorary Colonel of the regiment.
Politics.
In the 1886 general election, Sowler stood as a Conservative Party candidate in the Manchester South constituency, where he lost by around 350 votes to Sir Henry Roscoe. He was a Justice of the Peace and chairman of both the Manchester Conservative Association and the Conservative Club around the time of his being appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 1890 New Year Honours.
Death and family.
Sowler lived at Oak Bank, Victoria Park, Manchester from 1877. He died there on 4 April 1891 and was buried at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Bowdon. He had married on 25 July 1866 and had several children. His wife, Emily, was the daughter of James Yates, a bleacher.
Sowler's sons, notably Thomas and Harry, continued to run his newspapers as a limited company and expanded the stable to include titles such as the "Manchester Examiner".

The Old Bell Hotel, Derby

The Old Bell Hotel in Derby, Derbyshire, United Kingdom, is one of Derby's oldest and largest coaching inns and is situated in the historic street of Sadler Gate. Built in 1650, The Old Bell Hotel is located in Derby's Cathedral Quarter and is a Grade II listed building in the Derby City Statutory List, Buildings of Special Architecture or Historic Interest. Much of the building has been altered and restored but most of the original building can still be seen from the street consisting of a timber frame building of four storeys, the top being four gables, each with one window. Over the years The Old Bell Hotel has been used as a coaching inn, hotel, bar, restaurant, doctors surgery, courtroom, jail and other functions.
History.
The Old Bell Hotel's history stretches over 350 years and the building has been heavily modified over the years as it has changed from a coaching inn, hotel, bar and restaurant. The coaching inns of England have played an important part in the social history of the country, being used as auction houses, meeting places for all manner of events, venues for concerts and evening medical surgeries and The Old Bell Hotel was no different.
Sadler Gate.
The Old Bell Hotel is located on Sadler Gate which itself has nearly 1000 years of history. The history of Sadler Gate stretches back to Derby's occupation by the Vikings where the street and surrounding area would probably have been quite recognisable to today's inhabitants. The name Sadler Gate gives evidence of trades already present in the town, for 'gate' was an Old Norse word for street and Sadler Gate was where the leather workers lived and traded. The houses and workshops which lined those roads would have been constructed of wood or stone with thatched or shingled roofs.
The Old Bell Coaching Inn.
The majority of The Old Bell Hotel's history was as a coaching inn which was a vital part of Europe's inland travel. The Old Bell Hotel was one of Derby's largest coaching inns and during its peak it had over 50 hotel rooms, several kitchens and meeting spaces, a network of connecting tunnels between other inns and was the home of Derby's incoming mail from around the world which it later shared with The George Inn.
Owners.
The Old Bell Hotel has had many previous owners over the years. Some of whom have kept The Old Bell Hotel in their family for decades and other have only owned it for days. One of the longest owners of The Old Bell Hotel was the Campion Dynasty who owned the building from July 1775 to 1863. Following the Campion's reign of The Old Bell Hotel the building was taken over by James Francis King who was a well known local Derby hotelier. King's reign at the Bell started in 1865 with a complimentary dinner. It was held in the assembly room of the Bell in front of 120 guests. The Mayor called King "a king of caterers" following the meal.
In 2013 The Old Bell Hotel was purchased by local businessman Paul Hurst who invested £1m on restoring the building to capture its original past and it was reopened in July 2015.
Haunted History.
The Old Bell Hotel has numerous ghost stories and tales which have spawned from its 350 year history. The Old Bell featured on TV shows including Most Haunted. One story concerns a former maid at the inn named Mabel who was said to have hanged herself in her room after discovering she was pregnant. Another maid was said to have been attacked by one of Bonnie Prince Charlie's soldiers.
Usage.
The Old Bell Hotel's primary usage over the years was as a coaching inn, restaurant, bar and hotel. In 1969 The Old Bell Hotel was turned into a nightclub and the rest of the building remained derelict until 2013. Following its restoration in 2013-2015 some of the original spaces have been restored such as the Tudor Bar, Tavern Bar, Grand Regency Ballroom and Belfry Bar which are now used for live events and entertainment including weddings and conferences.

Frank Newton (racing driver)

Frank Newton was a British racing driver and engineer.
Career.
Frank Newton was a gold prospector during Canada's Klondike Gold Rush era. He worked in the Yukon Territory of Alaska in circa 1895. Later Newton worked as an engineer, circa 1900, he designed and built the Trans-Andean railway which at the time was the world's highest elevation railroad. At the beginning of the 20th century, Newton returned to England to become a motor racing driver back home.
Racing career.
In July 1907, Newton won the Century Stakes at the first meeting ever held at Brooklands, attended by 13,500 people.
On 23 September 1908, he won the Monatgu Cup at Brooklands, driving a Napier motor car nicknamed 'The Meteor', after having fought "a terrific duel" with Dario Resta, where their cars "banged wheels at top speed". "For a moment, it looked bad, but both drivers regained control." After the race The Brooklands Automobile Racing Club awarded Frank the Monatgu cup and was given a certificate authenticating that he drove 1 complete lap at an average speed of 113.01 MPH. 
In 1908, also at Brooklands, Newton drove a 90 hp Napier for its Australian owner Selwyn Edge, who had a £500 bet with D'Arcy Baker that his car could go faster than Felice Nazzaro's Fiat, but the Napier suffered from mechanical trouble.
Newton's preferred racing car was a Napier 90 hp.
Personal life.
Newton was married to Margaret, a keen gardener, and they had four children, Brenda Newton, Dudley Newton, Peter Newton and Kenneth Newton (in that order), when he was in his 50s and 60s.

Jacques Hivert

Jacques Hivert (1919–1987) was a French 20th-century martin baritone.
Biography.
Enlisted in 1942 in the Opéra-Comique troupe, Hivert was awarded a second prize in the Conservatoire de Paris for his singing. He quickly became indispensable thanks to savoury compositions that his talent as an actor enriched in a very personal way.
Countless Sacristians of "Tosca" (with Régine Crespin and Albert Lance), to Goro in "Madame Butterfly", Puccini's "La Bohème", where he alternately plays Marcel, Benoit, (side by side with Martha Angelici) were offered to him to interpret each evening, during an abundant secondary career within the , until the early sixties.
Francis Poulenc, appreciating him, acknowledged him a "chic and admirable diction" - "Happy father who has such a gifted child", will write the great French composer about him.
In 1947, Jacques Hivert recorded and created in the Salle Favard, the role of the son in Poulenc's "Les mamelles de Tirésias" alongside Denise Duval, a partner he will often work again with, particularly in Jacques Ibert's "Angélique", Manuel Rosenthal's "La Poule Noire" and in Henri Büsser's "".
In 1948, he flew to Buenos Aires, replacing his singing teacher Roger Bourdin, to perform Charlot, in "Angelique" (opera), in front of Evita Perón.
Skillfully disguised and unrecognizable, he will embody highly convincing characters of all ages. Darius Milhaud's "Le pauvre matelot", André Messager's "Monsieur Beaucaire", Guillot de Morfontaine in Puccini's "Manon", will remain among his remarkable compositions.
Married to the French contralto Denise Scharley of the Paris Opéra, he opened the doors of the Carmel of Compiègne to her where, for the first time in 1971, the Carmelites agreed to participate behind the grids in the concert he organised with his friend tenor Louis Rialland, of the "Dialogues des Carmélites", even singing religious songs of Francis Poulenc's opera. On the strength of this experience and supported by Georges Auric and Henri Sauguet, the survivors of "Les Six" chaired by Darius Milhaud, who wished to save the work, he will direct his wife on the provincial stages in this work where she remains unequalled as Première Prieur. While the latter embodies this leading role on the stage of the Paris Opéra in 1972 in a fanciful and contested staging by Raymond Rouleau, Jacques Hivert alone, faithful to the composer's wishes, won unanimous approval from critics.
He will once again stage Denise Scharley in one of her leading roles, Madame Flora in Gian-Carlo Menotti's "The Medium".
Jacques Hivert died in 1987, after having taught singing, the last role that was close to his heart.

Henry Villiers Parker, Viscount Boringdon

Henry Villiers Parker, Viscount Boringdon (28 May 1806 – 1 November 1817) was a British nobleman.
Life.
He was the son and heir apparent of John Parker, who had him painted by Benjamin Burnell in 1813. His mother was Lady Augusta Fane, second daughter of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, whom Parker had married in 1804 but from whom he was divorced by Act of Parliament in 1809 - she re-married to Sir Arthur Paget later in 1809.
In 1815, his father was creatd Earl of Morley and Henry assumed the courtesy title of Viscount Boringdon. However, Henry died at Saint-Mandé near Paris in 1817 aged 11, having "incautiously taken into his mouth an ear of rye" which having lodged in the "lowermost part of the lungs", caused his slow and painful death over several days, which he "supported with a firmness, cheerfulness and patience which circumstances the most trying could never disturb", as the monument by Delaistre erected to his memory by his father in 1819 in St Mary's Church, Plympton, relates. He was replaced as Viscount Boringdon and heir-apparent to the earldom of Morley by his half-brother Edmund Parker, who eventually succeeded to it in 1840.

Gjellerups Forlag

Gjellerups Forlag, originally Jul. Gjellerups Forlag, was a publishing house and bookshop located in Copenhagen, Denmark. Gjellerups Forlag is no longer operated as an independent subsidiary but the name Gjellerup survives as a brand for publication of textbooks for law students and other legal literature.
History.
Jul. Gjellerups Forlag was founded on 15 March 1883 when 25-year-old Julius Gjellerup (1858-1917) opened a combined publishing house and bookshop on the square Sølvtorvet in the new district that was emerging after the decommissioning of Copenhagen's fortifications. Early publications of fiction included Dansk Folkebibliotek, a series of translations of international classics for 25 øre published in collaboration with P. Hauberg &amp; Co, as well as works by new Danish writers such as Martin Andersen Nexø and Johan Skjoldborg.
With the opening in 1900 of the new Polytechnical College on the other side of the square, Gjellerup began to specialize in technical textbooks and other scientific literature. In 1903, his fictional portfolio was sold to E. Jespersens Forlag and from then on the publishing hose focused exclusively on school books and other nonfiction.
Gjellerup's widow Anine Gjellerup (1862-1943) took on the company after his sudden death on 6 June 1917, assisted by Harald Jensen as manager of the publishing house and Jens Peter Olsen as manager of the bookshop. In 1935 Harald Jensen took on the position as CEI of the company as well as of Nordisk Atlasfabrik. With Anine Gjellerup's death on 30 June 1943, ownership of the company passed to the daughters Karen Hartmann-Bornebusch and Inger Gjellerup Andersen. The company relocated to Rømersgade 11 in 1960. On 1 April 1972, the company was converted into a limited company ("aktieselskab") with P.E. Bjørrild as new CEO. In 1974 the company was converted into an "anpartsselskab" (Aps).
The company was acquired by G.E.C. Gad on 1 April 1984. The bookshop is merged into Harcks Boghandel at the corner of Fiolstræde and Nørre Voldgade, which has been renamed to Hack og Gjellerup.
Gjellerups Forlag and Gads Forlag co-founded Gad &amp; Gjellerup, a publisher of school books that later merged with Aschehoug's school book activities under the name Alinea.
Today.
Gjellerups Forlag is no longer operated as an independent subsidiary but the name Gjellerup survives as a brand for publication of textbooks for law students and other legal literature.

Brandon Topham

Brandon Rodney Topham (born Pretoria, 7 June 1971) is a South African politician, community leader and businessman. He is also a South African Freemason
Business life.
Brandon Topham has served on the boards of a wide variety of businesses, often as Secretary, CFO, Financial Director or Non Executive Director. These companies include 1time Airline, Ecsponent Limited, Seesa (Pty) Ltd, Telemasters Holdings Limited and the Professional Provident Society (PPS).
Education.
He is a Qualified Lawyer, Chartered Accountant, Certified Fraud Examiner (CFE), and Chartered Management Accountant (CIMA).
Political life.
Topham became interested in politics at the age of 16 when he witnessed the unfairness of apartheid. He avoided compulsory military service when he went to university.
As a long-standing member of the Democratic Alliance, South Africa's main opposition party, he was chosen to be the DA's candidate for mayor of the City of Tshwane in 2011. The governing ANC retained the metro, however. Topham thereafter led the DA opposition in the Tshwane council.
After standing unsuccessfully to be the party's mayoral candidate again in 2016, Topham instead became a Member of the South African Parliament for the DA and served as Deputy Shadow Minister of The Auditor General, and The Deputy Shadow Minister of Appropriations.
In October 2016 Topham criticised Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba and suggested that there is more to the South African Revenue Service's collection shortfall of R50.8 Billion and that "There may be a rolling of payment and collection. I suggest you do a performance appraisal for senior SARS officials and see if they’ve reported truthfully."
In 2018, Topham resigned from parliament.
Freemasonry.
Topham has been named grand treasurer of the Grand Lodge of South Africa in 2015.
He is currently listed as Secretary of Lodge Koh-I-Noor no 79 in Pretoria.
In March 2016 the Freemasons were accused of influencing the Democratic Alliance's candidate list. Topham dismissed these claims and stated "The Freemasons are not a secret society and do not take oaths. Some people who do not believe all men are created equal, use it as a bogeyman, as the Broederbond did in the previous dispensation" He further mentioned that only about 30 public representatives nationwide are Freemasons.
Forensic Accounting.
The forensic report detailing how R1,4 Billion disappeared during the Fidentia Scandal, a Ponzi Scheme, was co-compiled by Topham.

Icelandic Forest Service

The Icelandic Forest Service ( ) (IFS) is a subordinate agency to the Ministry for the Environment and Natural Resources of the Government of Iceland. This governmental institution works not only with and for the government but also for the public and other parties interested. The main subjects are research development, consultation work and the distribution of knowledge and know-how within the Icelandic forest sector. Furthermore, the IFS acts as Iceland's representative body for international forest-related cooperation. The Director of IFS as of 2016 is Mr. Throstur Eysteinsson. The Icelandic Forest Research Mógilsá () is a research division of the Icelandic Forest Service with headquarters located at , near Reykjavík. The head of research is Ms. Edda Sigurdís Oddsdóttir.
For over a century the IFS has had two main obligations, one being the protection and expansion of remaining native birchwoods in the country, the other executing afforestation projects throughout the country for the purpose of commercial forestry. Afforestation projects have been put through on IFS lands in different locations in Iceland. Furthermore, state supported afforestation on farms has in recent decades grown to become the main channel for afforestation activity in Iceland. Within the Icelandic farm afforestation grants scheme, contracts are made with landowners, afforestation plans are drawn up for each participating farm, seedling production and distribution are coordinated, education and extension services are provided and grants are distributed. State funding of farm afforestation grants reached a maximum during 2005-2009 but suffered severe cut-backs after the 2008 financial collapse. Planting is now on the rise again after a decade of stagnation. In recent years, with ever clearer signs of global warming, carbon sequestration has become one of the most important drivers of new afforestation projects in Iceland.
Iceland has been almost entirely devoid of trees, the trees having been cut down since Viking times, when Iceland had up to 40% woodland cover. The forest service has a programme to encourage people to grow trees in Iceland, planting millions of seedlings each year. Iceland currently has about 2% forest cover.
