History of agriculture in Chile

Agriculture in Chile has a long history dating back to the Pre-Hispanic period. Indigenous peoples practised varying types of agriculture, from the oases of the Atacama Desert to as far south as the Guaitecas Archipelago (43° S). Potato was the staple food in the populous Mapuche lands. Llama and chilihueque herding was practised by various indigenous groups.
The arrival of the Spanish disrupted in many places local agriculture as indigenous populations shrunk and mining rose to prominence. Mapuches in south-central Chile adopted sheep, wheat and the horse from the Spanish. Further south in Chiloé apple trees and pigs proved successful introductions into local potato-based agriculture. As the Spanish were repulsed from much of southern Chile, Central Chile became increasingly populated and exploited with husbandry becoming the most prominent agricultural activity in Spanish-ruled areas in the 17th century. In parallel to husbandry vineyards did also become more important. Spanish agriculture, centered on the hacienda, absorbed most of the scattered and declining indigenous populations of Central Chile. Much land in Central Chile was cleared with fire during this period. On the contrary open fields in southern Chile were overgrown as indigenous populations declined due to diseases introduced by the Spanish and warfare.
The 18th century saw the rise of wheat and wine for export to Peru.
Albeit many agricultural lands were devastated by the independence wars and outlaw banditry Chilean agriculture recovered fast and new lands were opened up for agriculture. This development, along with other factors, led to a conflict with free Mapuches in Araucanía. With the whole of Araucanía conquered in 1883 the region became the following decades known as the "granary of Chile". Dispossessed Mapuches were marginalized to small plots or mountainous terrain where their husbandry operations caused severe soil erosion. Chilean and foreign settlers intensive monoculture of wheat and logging also contributed to severe erosion. In the far south a sheep farming boom developed at the turn of the century as the Patagonian grasslands became settled. 
Despite the development of irrigation canals, limited introduction of wage labour and apiculture much of Chilean agriculture remained backward in relation to other economic sectors. Inquilinaje, an institution reminiscent of feudalism remained into the 1960s.
As part of a policy of industrialization Chilean state invested in the late 1950s and early 1960s into dairy plants, refrigerated slaughterhouses, sugar refineries and transport infrastructure. The subsequent Chilean land reform brought profound changes to agriculture in the 1960s and 1970s. Large holdings () were partitioned and land distributed to campesinos and cooperatives. Farmers syndicates were legalized and promoted. As the military dictatorship headed by Augusto Pinochet initiated a partial counter-reform in 1973 agriculture became increasingly run by large private enterprises and individuals who concentrated land ownership. Despite a setback during the Crisis of 1982, Chile's agriculture sector expanded in the 1980s, in particular fruit export.
Pre-Hispanic agriculture.
At the time of the arrival of the first Spaniards to Chile the largest indigenous population concentration was in the area spanning from Itata River to Chiloé Archipelago. In this area indigenous groups practised glade agriculture among the forests. The forests provided firewood, fibre and allowed the production of planks. Agriculture type varied; while some Mapuches and Huilliches practised a slash-and-burn type of agriculture some more labour-intensive agriculture is known to have been developed by Mapuches around Budi Lake (raised fields) and the Lumaco and Purén valleys (canalized fields). Pre-Hispanic agriculture extended as far south as the Guaitecas Archipelago (44° S), were indigenous Chonos cultivated Chiloé potatoes. Tools are known to have been relatively simple. In addition the Mapuche and Huilliche economy was complemented with chilihueque raising, fishing, collection of shellfish and algae.
Colonial agriculture.
As the Spanish settled in Chile in the 16th century many cities were founded and indean labour partitioned among Spanish conquistadores. Beyond subsistence the 16th century economy of Chile was oriented towards large-scale production. Spanish colonizers used large amounts of indigenous labour following the slave labour system used in the sugar cane plantations of the Mediterranean islands and Macaronesia. This system of labour successively killed the production base leading to the imposition of the encomienda system by the Spanish Crown in order to prevent excesses. In Chile Spanish settlers managed to continue to exploit indigenous labour under slave like conditions despite the implementation of the encomienda. Rich Spanish settlers had over time to face opposition to their mode of production by Jesuits, Spanish officials and indigenous Mapuches.
The initial Spanish settlers of Chiloé Archipelago (conquered in 1567) attempted to base their economy on gold extraction and a "hispanic-mediterranean" agricultural model. This activity ended in a general failure given the unsuitable conditions of the archipelago. Spaniards however reoriented their activities into logging "Fitzroya".
The collapse of the Spanish cities in the south following the battle of Curalaba (1598) meant for the Spaniards the loss of both the main gold districts and the largest indigenous labour sources. After those dramatic years the colony of Chile became concentrated in the central valley which became increasingly populated, explored and economically exploited. Following a tendency common in the whole Spanish America haciendas were formed as the economy moved away from mining and into agriculture and husbandry.
In the 17th century economy of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Chile's husbandry and agriculture based economy had a peripheral role, contrasting to ore-rich districts like Potosí and the wealthy city of Lima. Husbandry products made up the bulk of Chilean exports to the rest of the viceroyalty. These products included suet, charqui and leather. This trade made Chilean historian Benjamín Vicuña Mackenna label the 17th century the "century of suet" (Spanish: Siglo del sebo). Other products exported included dry fruits, mules, wines and minor amounts of copper. Trade with Peru was controlled by merchants from Lima that enjoyed protection by the Spanish authorities in Lima. In addition to the exports to coastal Peru Chile also exported products inland to Upper Peru through the port of Arica. Trade inside Chile was small since cities were tiny and self-sufficient.
In the 1650–1800 period the Chilean lower classes grew considerably in size. To deal with the poor and landless population a policy of founding cities and granting lands in their surroundings was implemented. From 1730 to 1820 a large number of farmers settled in the outskirts of old cities or formed new cities. Settling as a farmer in the outskirts of old cities (La Serena, Valparaíso, Santiago and Concepción) was overall more popular than joining a new city since it secured a larger consumer market for agricultural products. Chilean haciendas (latifundia) engaged little in the supply of Chilean cities but focused on international exports for revenues.
Chile begun exporting cereals to Peru in 1687 when Peru was struck by both an earthquake and a stem rust epidemic. Chilean soil and climatic conditions were better for cereal production than those of Peru and Chilean wheat was cheaper and of better quality than Peruvian wheat. According to historians Villalobos "et al". the 1687 events were only the detonant factor for exports to start. The Chilean Central Valley, La Serena and Concepción were the districts that came to be involved in cereal export to Peru. Compared to the 19th century the area cultivated with wheat was very small and production modest.
Initially Chilean latifundia could not meet the wheat demand due to a labour shortage, so had to incorporate temporal workers in addition to the permanent staff. Another response by the latifundia to labour shortages was to act as merchants buying wheat produced by independent farmers or from farmers that hired land. In the period 1700 to 1850 this second option was overall more lucrative.
The 1687 Peru earthquake also ended a Peruvian wine-boom as the earthquake destroyed wine cellars and mud containers used for wine storage. The gradual decline of Peruvian wine even caused Peru to import some wine from Chile as it happened in 1795 when Lima imported 5.000 troves (Spanish: "botijas") from Concepción in southern Chile. This particular export showed the emergence of Chile relative to Peru as a wine-making region.
Early Republican Era.
The independence wars in Chile (1810–1818) and Peru (1809–1824) had a negative impact on the Chilean economy. Trade was disrupted and armies in Chile pillaged the countryside. The war made commerce a high risk activity and royalist Peru, then the only market for Chilean agricultural products, was closed to commerce with independent Chile. The Guerra a muerte phase was particularly destructive for the Biobío area and ended only to see a period of outlaw banditry (e.g. Pincheira brothers) occur until the late 1820s.
The Chilean silver rush that developed from 1830s onward led a significant impact in agriculture as rich miners invested in the agriculture sector. German immigrants that arrived from 1850 to 1875 pioneered the use of wage labour in agriculture.
In the 19th century, access to the Californian and Australian markets made wheat export a very lucrative activity. In the mid 19th century, these countries experienced large gold rushes which created a large demand for wheat. Chile was at the time the "only wheat producer of some importance in the Pacific". At the same time as the wheat cycle new irrigation canals were built and apiculture and some machines introduced into Chilean agriculture. Apart from that, new markets were explored for Chilean agricultural products. The wheat boom did not last for long; by 1855 California managed to supply itself with wheat and from 1858 onwards it went over to export wheat to Chile. The Australian gold rush of 1851 had the effect of decreasing the labour used in agriculture forcing the colony to import wheat from Chile sustaining Chilean wheat exports whilst the Californian market vanished. After the gold rushes of California and Australia were over these regions begun exporting wheat competing with Chilean wheat forcing from the mid-1860s onwards wheat exports to be shifted to England. Between 1850 and 1875 the area cultivated with wheat and barley for export in Chile rose from 120 to 450 ha. The "cycle" came to an end in the late 1870s due to the increased technification of agriculture in the United States and Argentina plus the competition of Russia and Canada. The end of the wheat cycle added to the already difficult situation that Chilean economy was passing through in the 1870s.
Until the mid-19th century more than 80% of Chilean population remained rural working in agriculture or mining and was to a large degree self-sufficient to produce articles of consume.
Starting in 1873, Chile's economy deteriorated. In agriculture this was seen as Chilean wheat exports were outcompeted by production in Canada, Russia, and Argentina. As the victor and possessor of a new coastal territory following the War of the Pacific, Chile benefited by gaining a lucrative territory with significant mineral income. The national treasury grew by 900 percent between 1879 and 1902, due to taxes coming from the newly acquired lands. British involvement and control of the nitrate industry rose significantly, but from 1901 to 1921 Chilean ownership increased from 15% to 51%. The growth of Chilean economy sustained in its saltpetre monopoly meant, compared to the previous growth cycle (1832–1873), that the economy became less diversified and overly dependent on a single natural resource.
The establishment of the Buenos Aires-Mendoza railroad in 1885 ended the lengthy and costly trade with carts that connected these two regions of Argentina and facilitated cattle exports from the pampas to Chile, albeit in the last portion of the route the cattle had to walk over the high mountain passes of the Andes. These imports resulted in a lowering of meat prices in Chile. "Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura" (National Agriculture Society), a landowners organization, pushed for a tariff on Argentine cattle and in 1897 the tariff was passed in a bill at the Chilean congress. The unpopular tariff resulted a massive protest in that degenerated into a destructive riot in Santiago in October 1905. Chilean wine exports to Argentina were hampered by the lack of effective land transport and a series of war scares. This situation changed after the Pactos de Mayo were signed in 1902 and the inauguration of the Transandine Railway in 1909, making war unlikely and trade across the Andes easy. Governments agreed to sign a free trade agreement. Argentine winegrowers association, "Centro Vitivinícola Nacional", dominated by European immigrants protested vigorously against the free trade agreement since Chilean wines were considered a threat to the local industry. The complaints of Argentine wine growers in conjunction with that of Chilean cattle farmers represented in "Sociedad Nacional de la Agricultura" ended up tearing down the plans for a free trade agreement.
Tierra del Fuego and much of Magallanes Region did also experienced a fast growth of the sheepherding industry since the 1880s accompanied by colonization of the sparsely populated Patagonian grasslands. In the South-Central Araucanía the Chilean invasion of native Mapuche territory caused the economy of Araucanía to change from being based on sheep and cattle herding to one based on agriculture and wood extraction. The Mapuches' loss of land following the occupation caused severe erosion since Mapuches continued to practice large-scale livestock herding in limited areas.
19th century.
The 1900–1930 period was the one of largest growth of agriculture in the 20th century until the 1980s. Despite of this conditions in for rural workers remained harsh with Tancredo Pinochet denouncing the poor conditions of workers in the hacienda of president Juan Luis Sanfuentes during his presidency (1915–1920). Within a dual sector economic model the Chilean hacienda has been characterized as a prime example of a primitive and rural component. McBride, a British who visited Chile in the 1930s, is reported to have been "astounded" to see haciendas with "agricultural methods that reminds of ancient Egypt, Greece or Palestine."
Starting in 1953 the growth rate of Chilean economy decreased to an annual average of 0.7% but increased to an annual average of 2.4–3.0% in the 1957–1960 period. The decline in the economic growth from 1953 was attributed by some to a neglect of agriculture. The agrarian production in Chile contracted from 1950 onwards. A government plan set up in 1954 to address this ended with meager results and in 1958 a new plan was presented. That plan allowed CORFO to develop investments in dairy plants, refrigerated slaughterhouses, sugar refineries and transport infrastructure.

Bullpen car

The bullpen car, also known as a bullpen cart, is used in professional baseball to bring relief pitchers into the game from the bullpen to the pitcher's mound during a pitching change. Bullpen cars were used in Major League Baseball from 1950 through 1995, and returned to use in 2018. They have been used in Nippon Professional Baseball since the 1980s.
History.
The first bullpen car introduced in Major League Baseball (MLB) was "a little red auto" used by the Cleveland Indians in 1950 at the large Cleveland Municipal Stadium. The Chicago White Sox followed suit in 1951, becoming the first team to transport the pitcher from the bullpen all the way to the pitcher's mound. The White Sox discontinued the practice in 1955 after fans continued throwing garbage at the car. In 1959, the Milwaukee Braves began to use a (locally-produced) Harley-Davidson Topper with a sidecar as a bullpen car.
In 1963, the Los Angeles Angels became the first team to use a golf cart as their bullpen car. The New York Mets introduced a bullpen car based on a golf cart with an oversized team hat in 1967. The New York Yankees began using a Datsun 1200 painted with pinstripes in 1972. Rats chewed through the Datsun's cables, and the team switched to a Toyota Celica in 1982. The White Sox introduced a bullpen car built off of a Chrysler LeBaron in 1981, but it was also unpopular with pitchers, who refused to ride in it, and fans, who threw garbage at it.
The Seattle Mariners began using a version designed to look like a tugboat in 1982, called the "M.S. Relief". On Opening Day of the 1982 season, the Mariners' Bill Caudill hid the keys to the bullpen car, causing a delay in the start of the game. Caudill organized a boycott of the tugboat, saying that it "should be fined as an embarrassment to the team". No Mariners player ever rode in the tugboat, and it was removed from use less than a week later. A bullpen car appeared in the 1989 baseball movie "Major League". Pitchers disliked the bullpen cars, leading to them being phased out. The last MLB team to use a bullpen car prior to its reintroduction in 2018 was Milwaukee, which phased out their motorcycle (which was also produced by Harley-Davidson) in 1995.
The bullpen car remains in use in Japanese baseball. Most of them are convertibles so that fans can see the players inside, including many one-offs provided to the teams by the manufacturer. In the 1980s, the Yokohama DeNA BayStars of Nippon Professional Baseball introduced a bullpen car, a one-off Datsun Bluebird (910) convertible. It was the first of a few bullpen cars provided by Nissan to their hometown team. It would be followed by a Be-1 and S-Cargo in the 90s. In 2017, the BayStars began using the Nissan Leaf, while Yasuaki Yamasaki used a Toyota MR-S to enter games. The Tokyo Yakult Swallows also use a custom Nissan, a one-off Y34 Cedric roadster. The Hanshin Tigers currently use a modified smart fortwo convertible.
The Sugar Land Skeeters of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, an independent baseball league, introduced a bullpen car in 2012.
With an increasing focus on speeding up the pace of play of MLB games, MLB had a committee discuss bringing back the bullpen car in 2015. The Arizona Diamondbacks announced they would introduce their first bullpen car prior to the 2018 season. While the car was available on Opening Day, March 29, 2018, the first reliever to make use of it was Collin McHugh on May 5, 2018, for a sixth-inning relief role in the Diamondbacks' 18th home game of the season. The Detroit Tigers were the second team to introduce a bullpen car, on April 13, 2018, and the Washington Nationals became the third team to introduce one, on August 17, 2018. A bullpen car designed to look like a baseball glove was used during the 2020 Summer Olympics.

Stellenberg, Bellville

Stellenberg is a suburb in Bellville, Western Cape South Africa.
Name and history.
The suburb originates its name from the original farm on which it was developed. The farm were called Stellenburgh (later changed to Stellenburg), and was originally owned by Johannes (Joan) Blesius in 1705. Blesius named it after the Stellenbosch Mountain which one could see from the farm. Stellenbosch is named after the Governor of the Cape Colony, Simon van der Stel. Blesius was awarded the farm by Willem Adriaan van der Stel. This van der Stel was the son of Governor Simon van der Stel. Blesius (b.1656, d.1711) came from Breukelen, the Netherlands. The land felt under the jurisdiction of de Kuijlen. In 1707 Jacobus van der Heijden became owner of the land. The land stayed in the van der Heijde family until JF de Kock bought it. JF de Kock owned it up to 1736, when it was rewarded to Hilletjie Olivier. She died in 1765. On 3 January 1882 it was transferred to John Starke and then to Jacob Jacobus Hamman. In 1883 Charl Marais owned the land. He sold it to Maria Elizabeth Green (b 6 July 1856). In 1898 Hermanus Lambertus Bosman de Waal (b. 21 September 1863) bought it and he sold it to Francois Stephanus de Villiers in 1899. In the 20th century it was sold to Old Mutual and in 1969 residential development started. Stellenburg then became Stellenberg.
Area.
In July 1969 this land became available for residential development. It was necessary to develop the area, as the adjacent area in Bellville Eversdal grew and it was the natural extension of that area.
Modern Stellenberg.
Today it is situated next to the N1, shopping centres and schools.
Stellenberg High School is situated in the area, and in the adjoining part of Bellville Eversdal there is Eversdal Primary School. One of the Montessori school called Beehive is in the suburb.
More development.
More suburbs were founded around Stellenberg namely:
Stellenrigde,
Stellenryk,
Ridgeworth
Notable events.
The Kyknet produced television drama series named “Sara se geheim (Sara’s secret)” was partly filmed in the suburb. They made use of a local fishery in the area to do the film shoot. 
Dutch Reformed Church.
The Stellenberg Dutch Reformed Church (NG Kerk Stellenberg) was founded on 2 August 1971. The church seceded from Durbanville congregation as Durbanville became too big. It moved to the existing premises in Stellenberg on 3 May 1975. The cornerstone was revealed by Reverend JJC Visser. The church was one of the first (in 1995) in South Africa to have an annual Fest Market (Stellenberg Feesmark). It is held annually between end of October to middle November.

Background.
"2002" is a love ballad about a childhood romance of Anne-Marie's that took place in the titular year. She wrote the song with Ed Sheeran, Benny Blanco, Julia Michaels and Steve Mac. She was not initially planning to release "2002" as a single, but finally caved in after constant pestering from Sheeran on Instagram to bring it out.
The beginning of the song's chorus, "Oops, I got 99 problems singing 'bye, bye, bye' / Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me / Better hit me, baby, one more time", references six songs released between 1998 and 2004: "...Baby One More Time", "Oops!... I Did It Again", "99 Problems", "Bye Bye Bye", "The Next Episode" and "Ride wit Me". In an interview with Polish music magazine "luvPOP", Anne-Marie explained the song: "It is all about that year, when I was that age just listening to that music that I loved at that time. You know, Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott. All of these songs...Yeah, it just takes me back to that time." In a March 2017 interview, she mentioned Alanis Morissette as a big influence on her while growing up.
Composition.
"2002" is originally in the key of E major with a tempo of 96 beats per minute and a time signature of . The chord progression E–B–Cm–Gm–A–B–E is used in the verses; the progression Cm–A–E–B–A–B in the pre-choruses and bridge, A–E–B–Cm in the choruses, and E–B–Cm–A (the I–V–vi–IV progression) after the last chorus.

Solo exhibitions at public galleries include "Luke Willis Thompson: Misadventure" at the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane (2016), "Autoportrait" at the Chisenhale Gallery and "Luke Willis Thompson" at the Adam Art Gallery (2018).
His work has been included in major art festivals and group exhibition, including the 2015 New Museum Triennial "Surround Audience", the 8th Asia-Pacific Triennial at the Queensland Art Gallery (2016), La Biennale de Montréal 2016, and "Field Guide", the inaugural exhibition at the Remai Modern.
Awards and residencies.
In 2014 Thompson was awarded the Walters Prize for his work "". 
In 2016-2017 Thompson held the Chisenhale Gallery Create Residency at London's Chisenhale Gallery. During this time he developed two new silent film works: "Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries" (2016) and "Autoportrait" (2017).
In 2018 Thompson was nominated for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize, for "Autoportrait". He was announced as the winner of the prize on 17 May 2018.
In April 2018 Thompson was announced as a finalist in the Tate's Turner Prize, also for "Autoportrait". He is the second New Zealander to be nominated for the award, following photographer Boyd Webb in 1988.
Significant works.
"Untitled" (2012).
In 2012, a large-scale sculptural ready-made work by Thompson, "Untitled" (2012) was included in a group exhibition titled "Between Memory and Trace" at Te Tuhi Centre for the Arts in Pakuranga, Auckland. Shortly after, the work was shown at the Auckland Art Gallery as part of the 5th Auckland Triennial, and acquired for the gallery's permanent collection. The work consists of three roller doors once owned by Manurewa businessman Bruce Emery. On 26 January 2006 Emery saw 15 year-old Pihema Cameron and friend tagging the doors; Emery chased the two teenagers down and stabbed and killed Cameron with a fishing knife. 
"inthisholeonthisislandwhereiam" (2012/2014).
Originally presented at Hopkinson Mossman in Auckland, "" has no physical manifestation. Instead, participants were collected by taxi from the gallery, taken to a suburban home (later revealed to be the artist's own family home), where they were invited to move through the house but not enter the bedrooms, and then returned to the gallery. The work was restaged for the Walters Prize exhibition.
"Sucu Mate/Born Dead" (2016).
In January-February 2016 Thompson presented a sculptural ready-made work "Sucu Mate/Born Dead" (2016) at Hopkinson Mossman in Auckland. The work consists of nine headstones that were given on loan to Thompson for two years from the Balawa Estate cemetery in Lautoka, Fiji. When the work was shown later that year at the Institute of Modern Art in Brisbane, the gallery said:
This cemetery contains the graves of colonial migrant labourers from India, China, and elsewhere in Asia, who were indentured to sugarcane plantations. The cemetery is segregated along racial and social hierarchies. Colonisers’ graves occupy the upper part of the graveyard, which is set on a hill. Indigenous people are buried in the central section—including the artist’s own grandmother—while migrant labourers are interred at the bottom in an area which floods heavily. Thompson worked with the Fiji museum and the minister of culture in Fiji, to obtain permission to excavate the remains of damaged headstones and to repair their sites of excavation. Sucu Mate/Born Dead brings attention to the complicated historical interrelationships between cultures in the Pacific region, and highlights broader histories of exploitation central to colonisation.
"Sucu Mate / Born Dead" was also shown in the 8th Asia-Pacific Triennial at the Queensland Art Gallery in 2016.
"Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries" (2016).
"Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries" is a silent film shot on 16mm black and white film. Commissioned by the Institute of Modern Art, Brisbane, the work was completed when Thompson was artist in residence at Chisenhale Gallery. The film shows consecutive images of two young black men in portrait view (face and upper torso), wearing white dress shirts, filmed in front of a plain block-work wall. The films use the technology and aesthetics of Andy Warhol's "Screen Tests", short films made using Kodak Tri-X 16mm film stock, of visitors to Warhol's studio The Factory between 1964 and 1966. Each visitor was invited to pose for the duration of a single 100ft roll of film.
Thompson's subjects however are the descendants of women who died in London as the result of police brutality. 'Brandon' is the grandson of Dorothy ‘Cherry’ Groce, who was shot by Metropolitan Police in 1985 when they raided her home looking for her son Michael Groce. The shooting, which left Dorothy Groce paralysed, led to the 1985 Brixton riot. She died of complications from her injuries in 2011. 'Graeme' is the son of Joy Gardner, a 40-year-old Jamaican mature student living as an undocumented migrant in London who died after police raided her home intending to deport her in 1983. Gardner was bound and gagged by police and died four days later of cardiac arrest. None of the officers involved in these women’s deaths were convicted.
"Autoportrait" (2017).
"Autoportrait" is a silent portrait of Diamond Reynolds (who filmed and live-streamed the moments after the fatal shooting of her partner Philando Castile by police in July 2016) shot on 35mm black and white film. The work was completed when Thompson was artist in residence at Chisenhale Gallery, where the film debuted.
Thompson describes the work as a 'sister-image' to Reynolds' own video, which has been viewed millions of times around the world. In an interview with Thompson for The Guardian about the work, Hettie Judah wrote:
“Diamond,” says the artist, “needed to be interpolated into cinematic history – the history of cinema owes black life something.” Autoportrait is intended as a counter to the cameraphone footage Reynolds broadcast on Facebook – which was, and continues to be, widely shared. “She is recognised,” Thompson reminds me, “for the worst day of her life.” He wanted to provide her with an alternative.
"How Long?" (2017).
In February 2018 Thompson opened his first public gallery solo exhibition in New Zealand, at the Adam Art Gallery. The exhibition, titled "Luke Willis Thompson", features three film works: "Cemetery of Uniforms and Liveries", "Autoportrait" and a new commission "How Long?" (2017), filmed in Fiji in December 2017.

X-ray nanochemistry

X-ray nanochemistry is a discipline that studies how to use newly developed nanomaterials to improve the effectiveness of X-ray radiation. X-ray nanochemistry therefore includes many components such as nanomaterials synthesis, physical and chemical principles governing the ways of improvement, and applications of these improvements. X-ray nanochemistry was first mentioned by Guo et al. (Davidson et al., 2012). X-ray nanochemistry is more fully defined in the book of “X-ray Nanochemistry: Concepts and Development,” which is the first book about this new discipline.
X-ray nanochemistry is interfaced with many fields and applications such as kinetics and dynamics, X-ray spectroscopy, nanochemistry, catalysis, radiotherapy, radiation chemistry, photodynamic therapy, environmental science, sensing, batteries, high resolution invisible inks, X-ray driven signaling, biology, and many other fields and disciplines.

Resurrection Peninsula

Resurrection Peninsula is a peninsula on the larger Kenai Peninsula of the U.S. state of Alaska, which lies roughly 8 miles southeast of Seward. It contains very rugged geography, with very little flat land existing between sheer peaks and the deep inlets of Resurrection Bay to the west, and Day Harbor to the east. Due to the geographical nature of the peninsula, it is uninhabited, although numerous cabins, state parks, and general private in holdings exist. All land here is accessible by boat only. There is no concrete measurement of the exact of the landmass, however, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game has a management area which encompasses the landmass as well as lands that are not usually considered part of a peninsula. The land which better fits the definition is roughly 10 miles long, running from near Thumb Cove and Talus Bay to Cape Resurrection at its southern extremity. Slightly less than half of the land on the Resurrection Peninsula is part of the Chugach National Forest's southern terminus.

Oei Hui-lan

Oei Hui-lan (; 2 December 1889 – 1992), known as Madame Wellington Koo, was a Chinese-Indonesian international socialite and style icon, and, from late 1926 until 1927, the First Lady of the Republic of China. She was married firstly to British consular agent Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker, then to the pre-communist Chinese statesman Wellington Koo, and was a daughter and heiress of the colonial Indonesian tycoon Oei Tiong Ham, Majoor der Chinezen.
Both the parents of Oei Hui-lan hailed from the establishment: her father stemmed from one of the wealthiest families in Java, while her mother came from the 'Cabang Atas' aristocracy as a descendant of a "Luitenant der Chinezen" in Semarang's 18th-century Dutch bureaucracy. After an unsuccessful marriage with Caulfield-Stoker, she met Wellington Koo while in Paris in 1920. They married in Brussels the following year and first lived in Geneva in connection with the establishment of the League of Nations. In 1923, she moved with her husband to Beijing where he served as Acting Premier in the evolving republican Chinese state. During his second term (October 1926—June 1927), Wellington Koo also acted as President of the Republic of China for a brief period, making Oei Hui-lan the First Lady of China. The couple then spent time in Shanghai, Paris and London where Oei Hui-lan became a celebrated hostess. In 1941, she moved to New York where she died in 1992.
Oei Hui-lan, or Madame Koo as she became known, is also remembered for writing two autobiographies and for her contributions to fashion, especially her adaptations of traditional Chinese dress.
Biography.
Early life.
Oei Hui-lan was born on 2 December 1889 into a leading "Peranakan" Chinese family in Semarang, Central Java, then part of the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. Her father, the tycoon "Majoor-titulair" Oei Tiong Ham, headed Kian Gwan, a trading company founded by her grandfather Oei Tjie Sien in 1863 that became the largest conglomerate in Southeast Asia at the start of the twentieth century.
Her mother, Goei Bing-nio, was her father's senior wife and – unlike the "nouveau riche" Oei family – came from the "Cabang Atas", the traditional Chinese establishment of colonial Indonesia. Through her mother, Hui-lan was descended from the merchant-mandarin Goei Poen Kong (1765–1806), who served as estate master or "Boedelmeester", then "Luitenant der Chinezen" in Semarang in the late eighteenth century. The Chinese officership, consisting of the ranks of Majoor, Kapitein and Luitenant der Chinezen, was a civil government position in the Dutch colonial bureaucracy of Indonesia. Oei's maternal Goei family traces its roots and prominence in Semarang back to the 1770s. Goei Bing-nio's family had initially resisted Oei Tiong Ham's social and economic rise.
Hui-lan, who used the name Angèle in her youth, had an elder sister, Oei Tjong-lan, aka Gwendoline, from the same mother. In addition, her father had 18 junior wives and acknowledged concubines, as well as some 42 acknowledged children, including her half-brother Oei Tjong Hauw.
The two Oei sisters as daughters of Oei's senior wife lived with their father and were educated at home by a string of European tutors and governesses in Semarang, receiving a thoroughly modern upbringing by the standards of the times. This mirrored the westernization of the "Cabang Atas" in colonial Indonesia from the late nineteenth century onwards. In addition to her native Malay, Hui-lan acquired fluent English and French, and decent Hokkien, Mandarin and Dutch.
In 1905, Hui-lan and her sister were part of a recital in Singapore, where they were studying music. It was publicized in a local newspaper, as was a recital she gave in Semarang:
"The three cornered novelty of a young Chinese girl singing in French to an English audience in a Malay country next occupied the attention of the audience. This was “Farfalla” by Ms Angela [sic] H. Oei. Her effort captivated the audience, and but for the fact that encores were not allowed she would most certainly have been recalled. We have attended recitals great and strange in three capitals of Europe, but we must admit that this, the song of Miss Angela Oei staggered us. We repeat the novelty in a nutshell: a Chinese girl from Sumatra [sic!] singing a French classic in French to an English audience. Surely this is a world’s record! Is the East, after all, so far apart from the West?
"In March 1907 Angèle gave a vocal recital in Semarang, a soirée musicale, in the THHK school building in a fund-raiser for the school. She was accompanied by her sixteen-year-old niece, Lim Tshoen, from Singapore and her twelve-year-old nephew, Arthur Lim, on piano. Angèle performed pieces by French composers: Charles Gounod (”Siebel” in Faust) and Georges Bizet (from the opera Carmen) in elegant, fluent French.".
The progressive outlook and attainments of the Oei sisters received the admiration of R.A. Kartini, a Javanese aristocrat and pioneering women's rights activist. Despite their cosmopolitan background, the Oei sisters' contact with Javanese culture appears to have been restricted to interactions with servants, and being taken by their mother on courtesy visits and gamelan performances to various Javanese royal courts.
Marriage to Beauchamp Caulfield-Stoker (1909–1920).
In 1909, in Semarang, Indonesia, Hui-lan (using the surname Oeitiongham) married Beauchamp Forde Gordon Caulfield-Stoker (1877–1949), an Anglo-Irishman who was the British consular agent in Semarang, and eventually represented his father-in-law's sugar interests in London. The following year they moved to England, where they lived first at 33 Lytton Grove and then at Graylands, Augustus Road, Wimbledon Common, which had been purchased for them by her father in 1915. The couple had one son, Lionel Montgomery Caulfield-Stoker (1912–1954), and divorced in London on 19 April 1920. Hui-lan then lived with her mother and sister at their townhouse in Mayfair, London. This period of her life—when she was known in the society pages as Countess Hoey [an Anglicization of Oei] Stoker (presumably because her father had been called a count by some) and preferred to be called Lady Stoker—she omitted from her memoirs.
It had not been an easy marriage, with published reports indicating that Hui-lan's personality, pretensions, and social ambitions had driven her husband to distraction, to the point that by World War I they had become incompatible. "The Sketch" noted that "Countess Hoey Stoker is one of the best-known figures in London Society. She is the daughter of...the 'Rockefeller of China'." The society magazine "Tatler" described her as having "a fondness for aviation and [being] among the first ladies to indulge in civilian flying", while "The Times" noted that "no dance or other function was complete without [her]...a famous beauty who drove her own motor car about London…a little grey two-seater Rolls Royce that could often be seen threading rapidly through traffic." Margaret Macdonald observed Hui-lan, dressed as a Chinese ("which in reality she is"), at a costume party at The Ritz, also attended by Lady Diana Manners, the Duchess of Sutherland and Margot Asquith. Hui-lan reveled in the dancing and fashion opportunities provided by London high society. She also reveled in avant-garde fashion: "I was allowed to wear my favorite dinner dress, an amazing creation with full Turkish trousers made of green chiffon, a gold lame bodice and a brief yellow jacket. I tucked gold and green flowers in my hair and wore a triple strand of pearls". It was, she later remarked, "the brink of the flapper era and I fitted in like a charm. I had the figure for it, tiny and small bosomed, and the vitality. If you can imagine a Chinese flapper, it was I."
In 1915, Stoker took a commission in the Royal Army Service Corps and endeavored to keep Hui-lan at a distance, retreating to a separate bedroom when at home and rebuffing her desire to join him in Devonport, where he was posted: "It is quite ridiculous for you to come down here as you could not stick it for more than two or three days. In fact, if you came I should have to apply for leave as I could not possibly stop here". Their "lives and ideas were so far apart that it makes it impossible for [me to return home]". Hui-lan filed for divorce in 1919, claiming that her husband had refused to introduce her to his family and on grounds of cruelty and misconduct. The "Birmingham Daily Gazette" noted that the couple's marital travails bore a resemblance to the plot of Joseph Hergesheimer's "striking novel" "Java Head", a 1918 best-seller, in which, the paper stated, "the theme of which was the bringing home by an American of a Chinese wife of noble family, and their gradual alienation because of the lack of communion between the two".
Marriage to Wellington Koo (1920–1958).
Hui-lan's mother encouraged her daughter, now divorced, to make the acquaintance of the promising, Columbia-educated Chinese diplomat and politician V. K. Wellington Koo, himself a divorcé and a recent widower with two small children. Through machinations by Hui-lan's mother and sister and others—the parents of Koo's late wife, May Tang, among them—the heiress and the politician met in Paris at a dinner party in August 1920. They announced their engagement on 10 October, during a ball in honor of the anniversary of the Chinese Republic, and were married at the Chinese Legation in Brussels, Belgium, on 9 November. The bride wore an antique veil and an ivory gown by Callot Soeurs. Later that year, for a State Ball at Buckingham Palace, the new Madame Wellington Koo wore a dress by Charles Frederick Worth and a Cartier diamond tiara.
The couple began their married life in Geneva, where Koo had been involved in the formation of the League of Nations. Hui-lan followed her husband in 1923 to Beijing, where she supported him in his role as Foreign Minister and Finance Minister of the Republic of China. Her father, Majoor Oei Tiong Ham, acquired in 1923 a Ming palace compound for the Koos, in his daughter's name, that had been constructed in the 17th century for the courtesan Chen Yuanyuan, mistress of General Wu Sangui. In 1924, Madame Koo returned to her native Semarang for the funeral of her father, who had recently died in Singapore; she acted as mourner-in-chief, representing her absent mother as senior wife. In 1925, the Koos hosted the Chinese elder statesman Sun Yat-sen and his wife, Soong Ching-ling, for a long stay at their Beijing residence, where Sun later died.
During Hui-lan's time in China, the country was undergoing a very turbulent period in its political history the so-called warlord era, in which different military and political factions sought supremacy in the new, republican Chinese state. Wellington Koo served twice as Acting Premier, first in 1924, then again from 1 October 1926 until 16 June 1927. During his second term, Koo also acted as President of the Republic of China, which made Hui-lan – for a very brief period – First Lady of China.
With Koo out of office in 1927, the couple settled down in Shanghai, then the fourth-largest port city in the world. Hui-lan's social circle in Shanghai included the businessman Sir Victor Sassoon and Wallis Warfield Simpson, later Duchess of Windsor. Hui-lan recalls in her memoirs that Wallis's only phrase in Mandarin was "boy, pass me the champagne".
Hui-lan, however, found Shanghai in the 1920s wanting, and thought it "filled with...British shipping people...nobodies at home...[who] put on upper-class airs in China...they were so insular, so middle-class...and looked down their noses at everything really beautiful and indigenous to...[Chinese] culture: jade, porcelain, antiques. And the poor foolish Shanghai Chinese were so impressed with these upstarts that they copied their manners and filled their houses with 'Western' furniture (the so-called smart Shanghai furniture all came from Grand Rapids and was heavy and ugly)." In contrast, she was enamoured of pre-communist Beijing, whose classical order and ancient beauty she thought was comparable only to Paris. In later life, she exclaimed: "Peking is my city, where I once belonged and where I hope someday, if things ever change in my lifetime, to return."
Ambassadress and World War II.
The Koos subsequently relocated to Paris in 1932, where Wellington Koo had been appointed Chinese Ambassador to France, a post he kept until 1940. Following the fall of France to Germany during the Second World War, Koo served as Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom in London until 1946. Koo represented the Republic of China in 1945 as one of the founding members of the United Nations.
All through this time, Madame Wellington Koo was a celebrated society hostess in Paris and London. The great inheritance from Hui-lan's father ensured that the couple could afford to entertain the "beau monde" of Paris and London on a scale that was beyond the means of most diplomats. In the summer of 1939, she attended Elsie de Wolfe's party for the Maharani of Kapurthala at Villa Trianon in Versailles with a guest list that included Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli; some considered it Europe's last swan song before the Second World War.
She also oversaw the education of her two sons by Koo, Yu-chang Wellington Koo Jr. (1922–1975) and Fu-chang Freeman Koo (1923–1977), who attended MacJannet School in Paris, where they were contemporaries of Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, later husband of Queen Elizabeth II. Her eldest son, Lionel Caulfield-Stoker, lived in England with his father and stepmother, Nora.
Later life.
In 1941, Oei moved to New York City, where her sons Wellington Koo Jr. and Freeman Koo were educated at their father's alma mater, Columbia University. Her aim was to use her international connections to persuade the United States to join the war on the Allied side to help China's war effort in Asia. Although the Koos were later reunited in New York, the war years and separation had taken their toll; and the couple divorced in 1958. She spent the remainder of her life in New York City.
She authored two autobiographies in collaboration, first in 1943 with the society columnist for The Washington Post Mary Van Rensselaer Thayer, then in 1975 with the journalist Isabella Taves. In the 1980s, she was involved in a series of unsuccessful business ventures in her native Indonesia, including in shipping, tobacco and bicycles.
By the time she died in 1992, she had survived her former husband and both their sons. The business empire her grandfather and father built had been broken up by Sukarno following the Indonesian Revolution; and the Republic of China which she and her husband served for many decades had lost the Chinese mainland to the Communist Party.
Style, art and legacy.
Madame Koo was much admired for her adaptations of traditional Chinese dress, which she wore with lace trousers and jade necklaces. She is widely acknowledged for reinventing the Chinese cheongsam in a way that accentuates and flatters the female figure. Cheongsam dresses at the time were decorously slit a few inches up the sides, but Hui-lan slashed hers to the knee – in the heady 1920s – "with lace pantelettes just visible to the ankle". She thereby helped modernize, glamorize and popularize what soon became the Chinese female national dress. Unlike other Asian socialites, Madame Wellington Koo insisted on using local silks and materials, which she thought were of superior quality.
She was featured several times by "Vogue Magazine" on its list of best-dressed women in the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. "Vogue" saluted Madame Koo in 1942 as "a Chinese citizen of the world, an international beauty", for her enlightened approach to promoting goodwill between East and West.
An astute and avant-garde art connoisseur, Madame Wellington Koo sat for portraits by Federico Beltrán Masses, Edmund Dulac, Leon Underwood Olive Snell, Olive Pell, and Charles Tharp, and had her photographs taken by the fashion and society photographers Henry Walter Barnett, E. O. Hoppé, Horst P. Horst, Bassano, and George Hoyningen-Huene.
Her portraits, photographs and dresses are today part of the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Peranakan Museum in Singapore.
In contemporary culture.
Madame Koo's fashion legacy continues to attract attention internationally. She was featured as a "woman of style" at "", an art exhibition curated by Andrew Bolton and Harold Koda, and held to great acclaim in 2015 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 2018, the Indonesian designer Toton Januar created a video campaign for his Fall Winter collection, based on a reimagining of one of Madame Koo's portraits.
In her native Indonesia, Madame Koo has been the subject of a string of recent publications. Under the pen name Agnes Davonar, popular writers Agnes Li and Teddy Li authored a sentimental and sensationalist biography of Madame Koo, "Kisah tragis Oei Hui Lan, putri orang terkaya di Indonesia" ("The Tragic Story of Oei Hui Lan, Daughter of Indonesia's Richest Man"), published in 2009 by AD Publisher. "Oei Hui Lan: anak orang terkaya dari Semarang" ("Oei Hui lan: Daughter of Semarang's Richest Man"), another popular biography, was published by Eidelweis Mahameru in 2011. That same year, Mahameru published a popular biography of Madame Koo's father, "Oei Tiong Ham: Raja Gula, Orang Terkaya dari Semarang" ("Oei Tiong Ham: Sugar King, Semarang's Richest Man").

Assassination of S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike

S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the fourth Prime Minister of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), was assassinated by the Buddhist priest Talduwe Somarama Thero on September 25, 1959, while meeting the public at his private residence, Tintagel at Rosmead Place in Colombo. Shot in the chest, abdomen and hand, Bandaranaike died the following day at Merchant's Ward of the Colombo General Hospital. He was the first Sri Lankan national leader to be assassinated, which led to his widow Sirima Ratwatte Dias Bandaranaike becoming the world's first female Prime Minister.
Assassination.
Background.
Bandaranaike became prime minister after winning the 1956 elections in a landslide, at the head of a four-party coalition with a no-contest pact with the Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the Communist Party of Sri Lanka known as the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna (MEP) (the Peoples' United Front) which gains two-thirds majority in parliament on a wave of strong nationalist sentiment.
After becoming prime minister, Bandaranaike was officially moved to the Prime minister's official residence Temple Trees, however he also divided his time between his country seat at Horagolla and his town house, Tintagel at Rosmead Place in Colombo. On the morning of September 25, 1959 he was at Tintagel and receiving the public to hear their requests and complaints. The Prime Minister had been assigned a Police Sub Inspector (SI) for his personal protection. However Bandaranaike had sent him back on the grounds he should attend to more important duties and requested the Inspector General of Police to assign a few police constables instead. On the morning of September 25 only one armed police constable was on duty at the gates of Tintagel, while the sergeant in charge was not on duty.
The assassination.
Shooting at Rosmead Place.
Bandaranaike was seated on the front verandah meeting the public who had come to see him. There were about 20 persons inside the verandah and another 40 queued outside. Around 9 AM a Buddhist priest Talduwe Somarama Thero who had been waiting to see the prime minister took a seat in a chair in the verandah and kept a file on a short stool next to his chair. He was a lecturer at the Government College of Ayurveda and had stated that he wanted to meet the prime minister on requirements for the Ayurveda college.
As each person was announced and approached the prime minister on the matters related to them, Somarama Thero was announced and he stood up from the chair and approached the prime minister who in turn also stood up and came forward showing respect to the priest in the customary form. The prime minister asked what he can do for Somarama Thero who was tensed, told the prime minister that certain improvements were needed at the Ayurveda College. The prime minister responded that he would get Health Minister A. P. Jayasuriya to attend to it if he were to submit the requirement in writing. Around 9.45 AM Somarama Thero sat down again fumbled with the file on the stool he had left as if to pull out a memorandum and as the prime minister got ready to receive it, Somarama Thero instead pulled out a .45 Webley Mark VI revolver concealed in his robes and fired twice at point blank range hitting Bandaranaike in the chest and abdomen. Bandaranaike made a loud sound and fell down, but got up and with difficulty tried to stagger back inside the house.
Another priest Ananda Thero from Polonnaruwa who had been sitting in a chair close by witnessing the incident got up excited, Somarama Thero stood up and pointed his gun at Ananda Thero. Ananda Thero shouted and Somarama Thero turned around and followed Bandaranaike, shooting at him wildly. He fired four shots emptying the chambers of the revolver. One bullet hit Bandaranaike's hand and another a school teacher who had come to see the prime minister. The two other shots had hit a glass pane on a door and a flower pot breaking it.
Confusion and commotion had broken out and the police constable on duty at the gate came running in having been alerted by the sound of gun shots and Ananda Thero who had come out shouting that the prime minister was shot. The police constable fired at Somarama Thero wounding him in the groin and was quickly surrounded and overpowered. Bandaranaike ordered restrain and mercy towards Somarama Thero who was arrested and taken to the Harbour Police Station under armed guard while the prime minister was rushed to the Colombo General Hospital.
Aftermath.
Parliament was in session when news of the assassination attempt reached, Education Minister Wijeyananda Dahanayake requested that parliament to be adjourned but most of the members disagreed. However, many soon left to inquire on the prime minister.
The Governor General, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke was at Queens House accepting letters of credence of the Italian Ambassador Count Paolo di Michelis di Sloughhello. When he was informed about the assassination attempt he stopped the ceremony and rushed to Rosmead Place. He informed parliament to continue and at 11 AM declared a state of emergency, bringing the military to full readiness and mobilizing reserves.
Death of Bandaranaike.
Bandaranaike underwent a five-hour surgery by Dr. M. V. P. Peries, Dr. P. R. Anthonis , Dr. L. O. Silva and Dr. Noel Bartholomeusz and was transferred to the Merchants Ward. He regained consciousness and requested clemency towards his assassin and dictated a message to the nation. However, his situation deteriorated over night and he died twenty-two hours after he was shot. Death was recorded by Colombo Coroner J. N. C. Tiruchelvam, JP, UM at the inquest, stating that the death was "due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from multiple injuries to the thoracic and abdominal organs".
Bandaranaike had been scheduled to go to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in late September 1959. The Leader of the House C. P. de Silva was in London undergoing treatment having fallen ill after consuming a glass of milk at a cabinet meeting, therefore Bandaranaike had sent a letter to the Governor General recommending that he appoint Wijeyananda Dahanayake, Minister of Education as acting Prime Minister during his absence. With this letter present, Sir Oliver Goonetilleke appointed Dahanayake as Prime Minister on September 26, 1959 and was later confirmed by Parliament.
Funeral.
Following the inquiry proceedings Bandaranaike's body was taken to the Parliament building at Galle Face, to lay in state for two days, where thousands came day and night to show respect. On the third day, the remains were moved to Horagolla, where his funeral took place amid a sea of mourners. Like his father Sir Solomon Dias Bandaranaike, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike interned in a specially built mausoleum known as the Horagolla Bandaranaike Samadhi.
Official investigations.
Police investigation.
With the Somarama Thero in custody, the police started an intensive investigation with a team composed of DIG (CID) D.C.T. Pate, SP Rajasooriya, ASP K. Iye, IP Abeywardena, IP A.M. Seneviratne and IP Tyrell Goonetilleke with detectives from Scotland Yard arriving to assist. 
Arrests.
Soon multiple arrests in connection with the assassination were made. Most notable of these were Mapitigama Buddharakkitha Thero, the chief priest of the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, which put Prime Minister Dahanayake in a difficult position as he had soon after the assassination arranged for Buddharakkitha address to the nation over Radio Ceylon from Temple Trees on Bandaranaike. Following his arrest Vimala Wijewardene, then Minister of Local Government soon came under pressure to resign, she refused and was removed from office by Prime Minister Dahanayake and shortly arrested on November 21. Arrest of Buddharakkitha's associate H.P. Jayawardena, lead to rumors that J. R. Jayewardene was part of the assassination. Newton Perera, Inspector of Police - Administration Colpetty and Ossie Corea, a former excise inspector turned underworld kingpin were arrested. Corea had worked as a body guard for Finance Minister Stanley de Zoysa. F.R. de Zoysa, a businessman was arrested, and his brothers Stanley de Zoysa then Minister of Finance had to resign on 23 November and DIG Sydney de Zoysa was sent on compulsory leave. F.R. de Zoysa and Ossie Corea were later released, however the investigation found that the murder weapon belong to Ossie Corea and Newton Perera had provided weapons training to Talduwe Somarama Thero.
Magisterial inquiry.
November 26, 1959 seven persons were charged in the Chief Magistrate's Court of Colombo on a charge of conspiring to murder S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike. They were:
Fourth accused Somarama Thero also charged with commitment of murder. He had confessed to committing the murder in his statements to the police and to the chief magistrate, but later changed his plea at the Supreme Court trial. During the magisterial inquiry the seventh accused Amerasinghe, who was a Kolonnawa Urban Councilor became a crown witness and received a pardon. Sixth accused Vimala Wijewardene was cleared of all charges. This effectively ended her political career.
The magisterial inquiry was conducted by N.A. de S. Wijesekara, Chief Magistrate of Colombo lasting over 124 days with 193 witnesses testifying. In the end he committed the first five accused to stand trial before Supreme Court on charges of conspiracy and murder. Although a postmortem examination of the body was not conducted, Dr P. R. Anthonis recounted the injuries and gave the cause of death.
Cause for the assassination.
The investigation claimed that the reason behind the murder of Bandaranaike, was Bandaranaike's refusal to entertain Buddharakitha Thero's requests following his support for Bandaranaike in the election. Buddharakitha supported Bandaranaike campaign with funds and influence. Following the election, Buddharakitha approached Bandaranaike to secure a lucrative shipping contract to import rice from Burma and Thailand for a company named "Colombo Shipping Lines" which he had co-founded with his associate H.P. Jayawardena. Bandaranaike on advice of his Ministers Philip Gunawardena and R.G. Senanayake gave the contract to the government own "Ceylon Shipping Corporation". Bandaranaike further denied a lucrative sugar manufacturing licence to Buddharakitha and Jayawardena on advice of the two ministers.
Prosecution and punishment.
Supreme court trial.
The Supreme Court trial of the five accused commenced on February 22, 1961 before Justice T. S. Fernando, QC, OBE. With a seven-member English speaking jury, D.W.L. Lieversz Snr. serving as foreman. 97 witnesses testified and were cross examined. The prosecution was led by the Solicitor General A. C. Alles and Deputy Solicitor General A. C. M. Ameer assisted by Senior Crown Counsels R.S. Wanasundara and R.I. Obeyesekera.

Ratnesar. The fourth accused Somarama Thero was represented by Lucian G. Weeramantry appearing free of charge. The fifth accused Newton Perera was represented by N. Satyendra assisted by A. Mahesan.
Verdict.
The trail concluded on May 12, 1961 and the jury returned its verdict in five days. The jury acquitted Anura de Silva (unanimously) and Newton Perera (five to two). The jury found first accused Buddharakkitha Thero, second accused HP Jayewardena and fourth accused Somarama Thero guilty by a unanimous verdict and pronounced on all three of them the death sentence (death by hanging).
Capital punishment.
S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's administration enacted the Suspension of the Capital Punishment Act No 20 of 1958, which suspended the death penalty from May 1958. Following the Bandaranaike assassination, Dahanayake government attempted to reactivate the death penalty and within a week of the assassination a gazette extraordinary proclamation dated on October 2, 1959 re-introduced the death penalty. This was followed by the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act which was quickly passed in parliament and became law on December 7, 1959. It was brought was retrospective effect, aimed at inflicting the death penalty on those responsible for the assassination at happened on September 26. However, a loophole in the law allowed Buddharakkita and Jayewardene evade the death penalty as the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act allowed for a sentence of death to a person convicted for murder committed prior to December 2, 1959 and not for the offence of conspiracy to commit murder.
Court of Criminal Appeal.
An appeal was made by all three convicts to the then Court of Criminal Appeal which consisted of a five Judge bench with the Chief Justice Hema Basnayake, QC presiding and Justices M.C. Sansoni, H.N.G. Fernando, N. Sinnetamby and L.B. de Silva. George E. Chitty, QC of the unofficial bar was retained by the government to lead the prosecution assisted by L.B.T. Premaratne, QC and Crown Counsel Ananda Pereira. Deputy Solicitor General Ameer opposed this move and resigned in protest. E. B. Wikramanayake, QC argued that the Capital Punishment (Repeal) Act did not re-introduce the death penalty for conspiracy to commit murder. The court agreed with the submission. All appeals were dismissed but amended the sentences imposed on Buddharakkitha Thero and Jayewardena from death to rigorous life imprisonment.
Capital Punishment (Special Provisions) Bill.
By this time S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike's widow Sirima Bandaranaike had formed a government and was prime minister. Angered by the decision of the Appeal Court, the government drafted a new bill. On behalf of the government C.P. de Silva who was the leader of the house on January 18, 1962 presented the Capital Punishment (Special Provisions) Bill. The bill stated specifically that with regrade to the Bandaranaike assassination, provision was made for the execution of those convicted for murder and conspiracy to murder the former prime minister. It rendered null and void the Appeal courts decision to alter death sentence to life imprisonment for those guilty of conspiracy. The bill drew loud protests and outcry, with Dr Colvin R. de Silva stating that the bill was "a barbarous bill amounted to murder by statute". The government faced with widespread opposition withdrew the bill on January 25, on the pretext that an appeal to the Privy Council was in progress.
Appeal to the Privy Council.
All the convicted persons made an appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which were refused by an order of the Privy Council in May 1962. Sir Dingle Foot QC, appeared on an honorary basis for Somarama Thero. Newton Perera, who was accused of procuring the murder weapon, a .45 Webley Mark VI revolver and ammunition, as well as providing weapons training to Somarama was acquitted of murder by the Privy Council. However, following his release from remand prison, he was served with a charge sheet by the police and was found guilty of all. He was thereafter dismissed from the police.
Punishment of convicted.
Execution.
Talduwe Somarama Thero thanked his counsel Weeramanthri in open court and later converted to Christianity and was baptized in his cell by the Anglican priest Father Mathew Pieris. He was hanged in the gallows at the Welikada Prison on July 6, 1962. He was 48 years old. The hanging was undertaken by state executioner Lewis Singho and his assistant Subatheris Appu.
Imprisonment.
On May 7, 1966 acting on the advice of the Minister of Justice of Dudley Senanayake's government, the Governor General commuted the life imprisonment sentences of Buddharakkitha Thero and Jayewardena to 20 years. Buddharakkitha Thero died in 1967 of a heart ailment aged 46 years after having served time at Welikada prison for years of his sentence. Hemachandra Piyasena Jayewardena served 17 1/2 years of his sentence and was released on August 4, 1977.
Commission of Inquiry.
Sirima Bandaranaike in 1963 appointed a commission of inquiry under the Commission of Inquiry Act of 1948 to inquire into the political aspects of the Bandaranaike assassination. The commission consisted of Justice T. S. Fernando, Justice Abdel Younis from Egypt and Justice G.C. Mills-Odoi from Ghana. Commission received the services of Solicitor General A. C. Alles and Crown Counsels R.S. Wanasundara and R.I. Obeyesekera. W. Dahanayake, Lionel Goonetilleke (former Assistant Superintendent of Police, CID), Ossie Corea, F.R. "Dickie" de Zoysa, Vimala Wijewardene and Sydney de Zoysa were called to appear before the commission. The commission released a report as Sessional Paper III of 1964; with adverse finding of only former Minister Vimala Wijewardene.
Conspiracy theories.
Many conspiracy theories posit that the assassination involved people or organizations in addition to those accused and convicted. One of the major conspiracies are that the murder was carried out by Ossie Corea an underworld kingpin who was imposing as Talduwe Somarama Thero. Others claim that then Minister Stanley de Zoysa was an accomplice in the murder and his brother Sydney de Zoysa, Deputy Inspector General of Police of Range II had attempted to have Talduwe Somarama Thero killed soon after the Prime Minister was shot.
Reaction to the assassination.
The assassination evoked stunned reactions nationally and worldwide. It led to a period of political instability where the caretaker government of Dahanayake lasted only one year and following an in-divisive elections in March 1960 when Dudley Senanayake formed a government for a brief period. Bandaranaike's party the Sri Lanka Freedom Party selected his widow Sirima Bandaranaike as the leader of the party. She became the world's first female Prime Minister when another coalition led by the SLFP won elections in July 1960.
Artifacts, museums and locations today.
The murder weapon, fatal bluet and the Clothing worn by Bandaranaike on that day are on display at the National Museum of Colombo. Tintagel remained the private residence of the Bandaranaike family until it was converted into a hotel in 2010.

Neoclassicism in France

Neoclassicism is a movement in architecture, design and the arts which was dominant in France between about 1760 to 1830. It emerged as a reaction to the frivolity and excessive ornament of the baroque and rococo styles. In architecture it featured sobriety, straight lines, and forms, such as the pediment and colonnade, based on Ancient Greek and Roman models. In painting it featured heroism and sacrifice in the time of the ancient Romans and Greeks. It began late in the reign of Louis XV, became dominant under Louis XVI, and continued through the French Revolution, the French Directory, and the reign of Napoleon Bonaparte, and the Bourbon Restoration until 1830, when it was gradually replaced as the dominant style by romanticism and eclecticism.
Prominent architects of the style included Ange-Jacques Gabriel (1698-1782), Jacques-Germain Soufflot (1713–1780), Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806) and Jean-François Chalgrin (1739-1811); painters included Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and his pupil, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres (1780-1867).
History.
Neoclassicism in France emerged in the early to mid-18th century, inspired in part by the reports of the archeological excavations at Herculaneum (1738) and especially Pompeii (1748), which brought to light classical designs and paintings. The news of these discoveries, accompanied by engraved illustrations, circulated widely. The French antiquarian, art collector and amateur archeologist Anne Claude de Caylus travelled in Europe and the Mideast, and described what he had seen in "Recueil d'antiquités", published with illustrations in 1755.
In the 1740s, the style began to slowly change; decoration became less extravagant and more discreet. In 1754 the brother of Madame de Pompadour, the Marquis de Marigny, accompanied the designer Nicolas Cochin and a delegation of artists and scholars to Italy to see the recent discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and made a grand tour of other classical monuments. They returned full of enthusiasm for a new classical style, based on the Roman and Greek monuments. In 1754 they published a manifesto against the Rocaille style, calling for a return to classicism. Marigny, after the death of Louis XV, later became director of buildings for Louis XVI.
The style was given a philosophical appeal by the "Philosophes", including Denis Diderot and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who called for a restoration of moral values in society, and by the Abbé Laugier, who wrote "L'essai sur l'architecture", a call for a return to pure and uncluttered forms of architecture. The archeological sites in Greece and Italy became mandatory stops for aristocratic and scholarly visitors on the Grand Tour of Europe. The best young painters in France competed for scholarships to the French Academy in Rome. Ingres studied there, and later became its director. In 1757 the French architect Jean-François Neufforge published "Recueil élémentaire d'architecture", an illustrated textbook of the style. The new taste was originally called "le goût grec" (the Greek taste). It called for geometric forms and decoration in "the sober and majestic style of the architects of ancient Greece."
In the last years of the reign of Louis XV and throughout the reign of Louis XVI, the new style appeared in the royal residences, particularly in the salons and furnishings of the Dauphine and then Queen Marie Antoinette, and of the Paris aristocracy. It combined Greek, Roman, and what was loosely called "Etruscan" styles with arabesques and grotesques borrowed from Raphael and the Renaissance, and with chinoiserie and Turkish themes, Between 1780 and 1792, the style also appeared in architecture, in classically buildings including the "Petit Trianon" in Versailles and the "Château de Bagatelle" (1777). It also appeared in other art forms, including in particular the paintings of Jacques-Louis David, especially the "Oath of the Horatii" (1784).
Architecture.
Louis XIV, Louis XV and Louis XVI.
Classicism appeared in French architecture during the reign of Louis XIV. In 1667 the king rejected a baroque scheme for the new east facade of the Louvre by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, the most famous architect and sculptor of the Baroque era, in favor of a more sober composition with pediments and an elevated colonnade of coupled colossal Corinthian columns, devised by a committee, consisting of Louis Le Vau, Charles Le Brun, and Claude Perrault. The result, incorporating elements of ancient Roman, French, and Italian architecture, "resolves itself into the greatest palace façade in Europe."
Under Louis XIV, the Roman dome and facade of monumental columns became the dominant features of important new churches, beginning with the chapel of Val-de-Grâce (1645-1710), by Mansart, Jacques Lemercier and Pierre Le Muet, followed by the church of Les Invalides (1680-1706). While the basic features of the architecture of these churches were classical, the interiors were lavishly decorated in the baroque style.
In the latter part of the reign of Louis XV, the neoclassical became the dominant style in both civil and religious architecture. The chief architect of the king was Jacques Gabriel from 1734 until 1742, and then his more famous son, Ange-Jacques Gabriel until the end of the reign. His major works included the École Militaire, the ensemble of buildings overlooking the Place Louis XV (now Place de la Concorde (1761-1770)) and the Petit Trianon at Versailles (1764). Over the course of the reign of Louis XV, while interiors were lavishly decorated, the facades gradually became simpler, less ornamented and more classical. The facades Gabriel designed were carefully rhymed and balanced by rows of windows and columns, and, on large buildings like those the Place de la Concorde, often featured grand arcades on the street level, and classical pediments or balustrades on the roofline. Ornamental features sometimes included curving wrought-iron balconies with undulating rocaille designs, similar to the rocaille decoration of the interiors.
The religious architecture of the period was also sober and monumental and tended, at the end of the reign, toward neo-classical; major examples include the Church of Saint-Genevieve (now the Panthéon), built from 1758 to 1790 to a design by Jacques-Germain Soufflot, and Church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule (1765-1777) by Jean Chalgrin, which featured an enormous barrel-vaulted nave.
During the reign of Louis XVI, neoclassical was the dominant architectural style in Paris and in the provinces. Notable examples include the Hotel de la Monnaie in Paris (1771–76) by Jacques Denis Antoine, as well as the Palais de Justice in Paris by the same architect; and the theater of Besançon (1775) and the Chateau de Benouville in the Calvados, both by Ledoux. The École de Chirurgie, or School of Surgery in Paris by Jacques Gondoin (1769) adapted the forms of the neoclassical town house, with a court of honor placed between a pavilion with a colonnade on the street and the main building. He also added a peristyle and another floor above the columns, and transformed the entrance to the courtyard into a miniature triumphal arch.
The new theaters in Paris and Bordeaux were prominent examples of the new style. The architect Victor Louis (1731-1811) completed the theater of Bordeaux (1780); its majestic stairway was a forerunner of the stairway of the Paris Opera Garnier. In 1791, in the midst of the French Revolution, he completed the Comedie Francaise. The Odeon Theater in Paris (1779-1782) was built by Marie-Joseph Peyre (1730-1785) and Charles de Wailly (1729-1798). It featured a portico in the form of a covered gallery and columns in advance of the facade.
One of the best-known neoclassical buildings of the period is the Chateau de Bagatelle (1777), designed and built by François-Joseph Bélanger for the Comte d'Artois, Louis XVI's brother. The small chateau was designed and completed in just sixty-three days, to win a bet with Marie Antoinette that he could build a chateau in less than three months. Marie-Antoinette had a similar small neoclassical belvedere created by architect Richard Mique, who had also designed her picturesque rustic village in the gardens. It was completed in 1789, the year of the French Revolution.
Another notable example of the neoclassical style in Paris is the Hôtel de Salm (now the Palais de la Légion d'Honneur), built by Pierre Rousseau in 1751-83. The facade is distinguished by its simplicity and purity, and its harmony and balance. A colonnade of Corinthian columns supports the entablement of the rotunda, which is surmounted by statues. The facade is also animated by busts of Roman emperors in niches, and sculptures in relief above the windows of the semicircular central avant-corps.
A few architects adapted the neoclassical style to more functional purposes. Claude-Nicolas Ledoux designed the Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans with exaggerated neoclassical buildings arranged in circles around a central "temple", where the director's home and office was placed. He also designed several rotundas for the new customs barriers installed around Paris between 1785-89. These barriers became highly unpopular (due to the taxes, not the architecture) and most were destroyed during the Revolution, though those at La Villette and Monceau still stand.
The most visionary French neoclassical architect was certainly Étienne-Louis Boullée. His designs for an immense spherical monument to Isaac Newton (1784) and a vast new royal library in Paris in the form of a giant barrel vault (1785) were never seriously considered, but foreshadowed the architecture of the 20th century.
Revolution, Directorate and Empire.
During the French Revolution construction virtually stopped in Paris. The aristocrats fled, churches were closed and sacked. The one large project carried out between 1795 and 1797 was the building of a large new chamber within the Palais Bourbon, which eventually became the home of the French National Assembly. The École des Beaux-Arts was re-organized and reconstituted, with the architecture department under Quatremère de Quincy (1755-1849). De Quincy was an amateur archeologist and a classical scholar, as well as an architect. He was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court in 1793, but was spared by the downfall of Robespierre. He was charged with the conversion of the Church of Saint-Genevieve into the modern Panthéon, and assured that architectural studies taught the classical traditions.
After Napoleon Bonaparte came to power, the most influential architects were Charles Percier (1764-1838) and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine (1762-1853). Their grand projects for Napoleon included the Rue de Rivoli, with its uniform neoclassical facades, modeled on the squares built by Louis XIV and Louis XV. They also designed the interior of the Château de Malmaison, the residence of Napoleon, into the model of the neoclassical style. (1803) Fontaine designed another Napoleonic landmark, the Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806-1808) in the courtyard of the Louvre.
Other Napoleonic neoclassical projects included the grand stairway of the Luxembourg Palace (1801) by Jean Chalgrin (1801), and the Arc de Triomphe (begun by Chalgrin in 1808, but not finished until 1836). Pierre-Alexandre Vignon (1763–1828), a student of Ledoux, was charged with remaking the Church of the Madeleine, begun in 1761 but abandoned during the Revolution, into a "Temple of Glory" dedicated to Napoleon's army. This project was abandoned in 1813 after a series of defeats of Napoleon's army; it became a church again, but was not completed until 1843. Napoleon also added a neoclassical facade with twelve Corinthian columns to the facade of the Palais Bourbon. It was in an entirely different style than the palace behind it, and was not aligned with it; it was aligned instead with the new Temple of Glory (now the Madeleine) which he was building, facing it, on the far side of the Place de la Concorde.
The Restoration and arrival of romanticism.
After the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, the neoclassic style continued to be used during the French Restoration, particularly in Paris churches. Examples include Notre-Dame-de-Lorette (1823–26) by Louis-Hippolyte Lebas and Saint-Vincent-de-Paul by Jacques-Ignace Hittorff (1824–44). By the 1830s, the architectural style was succeeded by Baroque Revival and Beaux-Arts architecture.
A change of style began to appear early in the 19th century, particularly after the publication in 1802 of "le Génie du christianisme" by one of the leading figures of French romanticism, François-René de Chateaubriand (1768-1848). He appealed for a return to the Gothic style, which, as the style of the great cathedrals, he considered was the only truly great French style. The movement toward romanticism and gothic was accelerated by the publication of the hugely successful novel "Notre-Dame de Paris" by Victor Hugo in 1821, and then the program of restoration of French Gothic monuments led by Prosper Mérimée and conducted by Eugène Viollet-le-Duc (1814-1879). This, along with the French Revolution of 1830, brought to a close the era of French neoclassicism.
Painting.
The dominant figure in French neoclassical painting, even before the Revolution, was Jacques Louis David (1748-1825). He began as a classical and religious painter, an admirer of Jean-Baptiste Greuze, the history and genre painter. He was recommended to the Royal Academy of Fine Arts by a family friend, François Boucher, master of the rococo style. He won the prestigious Prix de Rome and went to study there in 1775. He discovered the treasures excavated from Pompeii and other ancient sites, and entirely changed his style. Beginning in 1784 he painted works based on stories from classical literature, including "Oath of the Horatii" (1781), a celebration of duty and sacrifice in Roman times. When the French Revolution began in 1789, David became an active participant in the most extreme wing, the Jacobins, He supported the dissolution of the Academy of Fine Arts, and designed sets for revolutionary pageants and ceremonies. His most famous picture of the period, "Marat Assassiné" (1793), adapted the facial expression and the limp arm of Christ in Michaelangelo's "Pieta" to depict the assassinated Jacobin leader, Jean Paul Marat. When the Jacobins fell in 1794, he was imprisoned twice for several months, but then resumed an active career as a portraitist and then as court painter for Napoleon Bonaparte. When Napoleon fell and the monarchy was restored, he went into exile in Belgium.
French painting was dominated for years by David and his pupils, including Antoine-Jean Gros (1771-1835), and later Jean-Auguste Dominique Ingres (1780-1867). The later neoclassical painters put aside the political messages and concentrated on idealized figures and ideas of beauty; they included François Gérard, who like David, made a famous portrait of Madame Récamier, much to the annoyance of David; Jean-Baptiste Regnault (1754-1829); Pierre-Paul Prud'hon (1758-1823); Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun (1755-1842) and Anne Louis Girodet-Trioson (1767-1824).
Sculpture.
The most prominent French sculptor in the early neoclassical period was Étienne Maurice Falconet (1716-1791). whose work included the heroic statue of Peter the Great on horseback in Saint Petersburg, Russia (model made in 1770, but not cast until 1782). He was named professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris in 1766, and from 1757 onward he directed the modeling of small sculptures in porcelain at the Sèvres Porcelain manufactory. His work remained closer to the statues in full movement of the French baroque than the new, more serene style. In his later years he designed small ornamental sculptures of cast bronze such as the "Seated Girl" (1788), now in the Metropolitan Museum.
The first more clearly neoclassical major figure was Jean-Antoine Houdon (1741-1828). He studied at the French Academy in Rome, where he made detailed studies of the anatomy of the ancient Roman and Greek statues on display there. He became famous for his busts and portrait sculptures, most notably his seated statue of Voltaire (1779–81), now on display at the Comedie Française, and his busts of Benjamin Franklin and other political figures of the day. He also created several allegorical works illustrating winter and summer in a style entirely more expressive than traditional classicism, such as his "La Frileuse" (woman in winter), in the Musée Fabre in Montpellier.
The sculptor Claude Michel (1738-1814), also known as Clodion, also studied at the Academy in Rome between 1762 and 1771. His works varied widely from neoclassical to rococo; he conceived a terra-cotta model for an extraordinary monumental sculpture, covered with statuary of angels and cupids, to celebrate the first balloon flight in Paris (1784).
Augustin Pajou (1730-1809) also studied at the French Academy in Rome from 1752 and 1756. He returned to Paris to teach at the Academy of Fine Arts, and became rector in 1792. He made a series of highly expressive statues on mythological subjects, including "Psyche" and "Amour".
Interior decoration.
The "goût Grec" or "Greek taste" in design was introduced in France in 1757 by Jean-François de Neufforge in his book "Recueil élémentaire d'architecture", which praised "the majestic and sober style of the architects of ancient Greece." He offered engravings of classical vaults, garlands of laurel leaves, palmettos and "guilloches" (braided interlaced ribbons) and other motifs which soon appeared in Paris salons.
Beginning in the 1770s, the "style pompéien" or Pompeii style came into fashion in Paris, based on reproductions of designs found in Pompeii, augmented with arabesques, griffons, sphinxes, horns-of-plenty and vases on tripods, interlaced with vines and medallions and painted on tall rectangular panels on the walls painted white and bordered with gilded stucco. The new style also took inspiration from the decorative grotesques of Raphael painted at the Vatican in 1510. The boudoir of Marie-Antoinette at the Palace of Fontainebleau, designed by Rousseau de la Routière in 1790, just after the Revolution began, is a notable example.
During the French Revolution, the aristocracy fled Paris, and most of the palaces and town houses were stripped of furnishings and decoration. A new version of neoclassicism appeared briefly during the French Directorate (1795–99), which mingled elements the Pompeiian style with the Adam style from England. When Napoleon Bonaparte seized power from the Directory, the neoclassical style began to take on a new form, called Empire Style (1799-1815).
The Empire Style had extraordinary coherence and audacious simplicity, thanks to Napoleon's two energetic chief designers, Charles Percier (1764-1838) and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine (1762-1853). The motifs were usually symbols of empire, including crowns and laurel wreaths, medals, lyres, horns of plenty, and classical heads seen in profile. Rooms sometimes had the walls draped in fabric, representing the tents of an army on campaign. Interiors and furniture often featured classical columns carved of wood. Egyptian motifs and mythical beasts from antiquity, such as the sphinx, griffon and the chimera, were popular. Imperial emblems, including the eagle, the bee, and the letter N with a crown, were also common.
Furniture.
The first "Greek taste" furniture in France, made in 1756 and 1757 to designs by Jean-François de Neufforge (1714-1791) and Jean-Charles Delafosse (1734-1791), was massive, rectangular and heavily decorated, with gilded columns, friezes and hanging garlands. However, soon afterwards the royal cabinet maker Jean-Francois Oeben produced much lighter and more graceful works for Louis XV and Madame Pompadour. These were a hybrid of the curves of rococo with the right angles of neoclassicism. The chairs had curving "à cabriolet" legs and cartouche-shaped backs, combined with neoclassic garlands and friezes. Oeben refurnished Versailles and other royal palaces with innovative new kinds of furniture; the cylinder, or roll-top desk; the table with a mechanical writing surface that could be raised; and the drop-front desk.
After the death of Oeben, his place was taken by two of his disciples, Jean-Henri Riesener (1734-1806) (who married Oeben's widow); and Jean-François Leleu. Riesener and Leleu produced furniture with superb wood-inlay, or marquetry, often in floral designs; and cabinets of mahogany decorated with glided bronze floral decor and column legs.
In Louis XVI furniture, particularly in the 1780s, the furniture styles became lighter, more geometric, and more simply ornamented, following the tastes of Marie Antoinette. The leading French designers during this period were Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748-1803) and Georges Jacob (1739-1814). At the very end of the reign of Louis XVI, Sené and Jacob were producing highly original and imaginative forms, including chairs with lyre-shaped carved wooden backs and the "Etruscan chair", a type conceived by the painter Hubert Robert for the fantasy "rural hamlet" of Marie-Antoinette at Versailles. The ornament on the chair, which remained popular long after the period ended, was borrowed from ancient Grecian vases.
The furniture craft was upended by the French Revolution; the aristocratic clients fled, and the furniture of the royal palaces was sold in enormous auctions; a large part went abroad. One positive development for furniture-makers was the abolition of the old guild rules; after 1791 the makers of furniture frames could collaborate with those who did the marquetry inlay. The Etruscan taste disappeared, but the neoclassic style flourished under the French Directory (1793–99), the French Consulate (1799-1804), and the Empire of Napoleon Bonaparte.
The last leading furniture designer for Louis XVI, Georges Jacob, formed a new firm with his two brothers, and, between 1796 and 1803, became the most prominent designer of the later neoclassical period. He made an effort to find classical forms that were more authentic. The type of Greek chair called the "klismos" became especially popular; Jacob produced a variety of neoclassical divans and stools, as well as the "Lit de Repos", or day bed, which appeared in Jacques-Louis David's portrait of Madame Recamier. Another popular form was the folding stool, modeled after those that were used in Roman army encampments. After Napoleon's invasion of Egypt in 1798, Egyptian designs, in stylized geometric form, appeared on furniture. Gilded bronze ornaments of extremely fine craftsmanship were made in Paris workshops and exported to the royal houses of Europe. The continual European wars and blockades made it difficult to import exotic woods, and sometimes local woods such as lemon trees were used; mahogany remained the choice for prestige furniture. The master furniture craftsmen of the late Empire style included Bernard Molitor, who made the furniture for the Chateau of Saint Cloud, and
the architects Charles Percier and Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine, who made furniture as authentic as possible to Greek and Roman models for the residences of Napoleon and for clients of the new Napoleonic aristocracy.

Diamond, Utah

Diamond is a ghost town in eastern Juab County, Utah, United States. The Diamond Cemetery is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Description.
The site of the former community is along the Diamond Gulch on the western slopes of the East Tintic Mountains, northwest of Sunrise Peak, just east of the Tintic Valley, and about south of Eureka. There are multiple abandoned mines in the surrounding area, and it is considered part of (but south of the active area of) the Tintic Mining District.
The community received its name from the quartz crystals found in the area that were originally thought to be diamonds.
History.
Diamond was first settled 1870 following the discovery of the "diamonds" in the area. Soon after a post office was established and saloons, stores, and even a school was built. The population eventually grew to about 900, but after water was struck in the nearby mines the last residents moved away in 1890 and the town was abandoned. However, the post office apparently remained open until 1906. The community's last house was moved in 1923. All that remains are the mining tailings and a cemetery.
Diamond Cemetery.
The Diamond Cemetery is a small property that is the only remaining remnant of the former town of Diamond (one of the earliest mining camps in the Tintic Mining District. Very little of the original cemetery remains, but at least one gravesite is still maintained and visited by the family of Amber Rose and possibly a new addition to the cemetery in 2014. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places March 14, 1979.

Alena Hájková

Alena Hájková (11 October 1924 in Prague – 2 August 2012 in Prague) was a Czech Communist resistance fighter and historian.
Resistance.
Alena née Divišová was born in 1924 to a working class Prague family in Vršovice. At 14, she left school and went to train as a seamstress. It was in her job that she met a Jewish friend, through who she was introduced to a Jewish circle of leftist Hashomer Hatzair. This group of Jewish and non-Jewish Communist friends formed in 1943 the resistance group Přehledy. Among them, Hájková met Jany Lebovič from eastern part of Czechoslovakia, with whom she fell in love. When the transports to Theresienstadt started in fall 1941, Hájková and her family helped the deportees with food and preparation for transports. Later, the gentiles in the group supported the Jewish members avoid transports under a false, non-Jewish identity. Among those who had gone to hiding was Lebovič. Hájková participated in help for Jewish friends and other resistance: in the first months of Terezín ghetto, she visited a few times and smuggled food to her friends. Later, she actively organized papers for those who went into illegality. In March 1944, she was arrested and deported to Small Fortress Theresienstadt and in July 1944 to Ravensbrück concentration camp. Before her liberation in April 1945, she was forced to do forced labor for the German armament industry, firm Hasag in the Schlieben and Altenburg satellite camps of Buchenwald. Hájková escaped in April 1945 from a death march during a bomb raid in Zwickau.
Postwar.
Upon her return to Prague, Hájková learned that her fiancé had been arrested together with most of the Přehledy in August 1944, and murdered in Auschwitz. She and a friend from Přehledy, Miloš Hájek, married and had two sons. Her granddaughter Anna Hájková is a historian at the University of Warwick. Their marriage ended in divorce in 1971. She started studying in 1945 at the University of Political and Social Affairs (Vysoká škola politická a sociální), but her studies were interrupted when her children were born. In 1952, at the height of Slánský trials, she was one of the few who supported her friends when they were arrested. Via long distance, Hájková studied history at the Philosophical Faculty of the Charles University and, in 1960, received her PhD. All the while, she was supporting her husband who was doing academic career. In 1960, she started working full time as historian: until 1965, she worked as lecturer of humanities at ČVUT, next five years at the Czechoslovak committee for history of antifascists resistance. During normalization, she spent her last working years as specialist in the defense ministry, where it was her job to write confirmations about participation in resistance according to the law 255/1946. This law enabled many former resistance fighters, who were now dissidents, to live on an early pension.
Research.
Hájková's expertise was leftist and Communist resistance in Second World War; she focused on individual people and wrote about Jewish Communist resistance fighters who were politically unpopular. Her books and articles are still in circulation, unlike most of contemporary Czech scholarship. In 1989, Hájková was reunited with her old Jewish friends from resistance who had emigrated to Israel and US. In 1991, she was awarded the title Righteous among the nations." In 1995, she coedited a critical edition of Julius Fučík's Notes from the Gallows. She cooperated with Miroslav Kárný on researching the Holocaust and resistance in the Protectorate, and contributed to the research of the Terezín Memorial, including their prisoner database. Hájková continued researching until her 80s; and died in Prague in 2012. Her papers are at the Czech National Archive.

Osthelden

Osthelden is a constituent community of Kreuztal, Siegen-Wittgenstein, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany and has its name from the stream "Osthelde". It is located on the road from Wenden to Kreuztal, where the road descends into the valley with a sharp bend and has 710 inhabitants.
History.
Osthelden is one of the oldest settlements in the Siegerland. There is no document about its origin. In terms of folk culture, Osthelden is a Moselle Franconian-speaking place and is situated on the Uerdinger and Benrather lines. It is unclear since when the first humans used the protected hollow on the upper reaches of the Osthelden stream as a settlement. The first written reference to "Osthelden" can be found in the "Bickenschen Mannbuch", a feudal register of the "Lords of Bicken". There it says (in today's words): Anno Domini 1344 - "The Lords of Bicken (Burg Hainchen/Netphen) had left the tenth rights in Osthelden and Fellinghausen to the Gobel von der Hees".
For the year 1461, five persons subject to statutory requirements are named. Nine households are mentioned in a tax list from 1563. The first exact map "Markung des Dorfes Osthelden" was produced in 1720 by Erich Philipp Ploennies.
Of the 28 buildings drawn in the register of 1834, 24 are residential buildings. The oldest surviving house in Osthelden - built in 1657 - was demolished in 2003.
Until the communal reorganization in North Rhine-Westphalia on January 1, 1969, Osthelden was an independent municipality, which included today's Kreuztal borough Junkernhees. The places were part of the "Amt Ferndorf" at that time.

Ignazio Francesco Scodnik

Francesco Ignazio Scodnik born in Kanal (Italian: Canale d’Isonzo, German: Kanalburg) on 23 July 1804, died in Milan on 7 November 1877, was an Italian and Austrian Army Officer.
Early life.
Francesco Ignazio Scodnik or -Franc Ignacij Škodnik in Slovenian - was born into a Gorizian – Lombard family in the present day Kanal ob Soci now Slovenjia. He lost his father in infancy, and was raised by his eldest brother Pietro, in Segna, now Senj in Croatia who was a Military Auditor.
Military career on Austrian service.
At the beginning of 1821 Scodnik was assigned to the cadet company with the 23 Infantry Regiment “Feldmarschall-Lieutenant Graf Ceccopieri” in Cremona, Italy, where his brother Giuseppe was also serving. A year later he was at the Cadet School of Buda in Hungary for a three-year cadet course. The lack of wars was an unfavorable condition for promotion and he was made Ensign on 1830; in 1832 he was promoted Second Lieutenant and in 1835 Lieutenant; temporary Captain in 1845, and become substantive Captain in 1847. At the beginning of 1848, he was considered for the rank, Major, after having been acting Regimental Major in few garrisons.
Military career on Italian service.
Until 1844, Scodnik was not interested in politics. He, like many of his contemporaneous Officers on Austrian service, was just dedicated to his career. It appears that during his assignment in Cremona, where his mother was living, and where she also died in June 1844, he started reading about Italian history, and become involved in politics. The early 40s where peaceful years, but it was just the calm before the storm, that would erupted in 1848 in the whole Europe. Possibly the nationalism that will destroy Austria 70 years later begun in those years, and Scodnik, whose mother was probably Italian, started seeing the Austrian army as an oppressor of the Italian liberty, rather than the legitimate army of his country. He was partly from Lombard – Italian descend and had many relatives living in the Austrian Lombardy, and that might have played a part in his conversion to the Italian cause. On 19 March 1848, almost simultaneously with the popular uprisings of 1848 in the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, the city of Milan also rose. Cremona was not far from Milan and the news spread out. The whole city was soon draped with Italian national flag, and many Austrian soldiers of Italian ancestry, soon fraternized with the locals. The situations quickly escalated and the Austrian commanding Officer, General Schonhals, signed an agreement with the provisional government, and three battalions composed by Italians, went under the provisional Government control, while the other Austrian would left the city undisturbed. The provisional government offered to Scodnik who was the oldest captain, the command of the three battalions and the rank of Major. He broke the indulges and accepted the proposal, thus crossing into the Italian side. On 23 March 1848 in Cremona he formed the group of “Lombard Legion”. On 7 April 1848 with a force of 3500 men he arrived in Milan. His forces were merged into the 1 Line Infantry Lombard Regiment. On 17 June 1848 Scodnik was promoted to Lieutenant colonel, and took part at the engagement of Zelo Buon Persico, where he was wounded. He earned the appraisal of his commanding Officer and former Napoleons cavalry officer, Colonel Giacomo Sessa. After the First Italian War of Independence, Scodnik entered into the Royal Piedmont Army, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He retired on 24 September 1868 as a Major General.
Personal life.
In June 1844, his mother died in Cremona while he was stationed there, and on 4 October 1844 he married Maria Miller in Buda (Hungary). Their marriage produced three children, two daughters, Melania a writer, Irene who later married another prominent Italian irredentist and red skirts Officer, Matteo Renato Imbriani, and a son, Enrico.
Death.
Francesco Ignazio Scodnik died on 7 October 1877. He is interred in Milan. The city of Gorizia has a street named after him.

Loliolus

Loliolus is a genus of squid from the family Loliginidae from the Indo-Pacific region. The genus is divided into two subgenera "Loliolus" and "Nipponololigo". They are small squids of less than 150mm in mantle length which have an expanded tentacular club. This club has 4 series of suckers. The sucker rings have plate-like teeth which are square in shape all around them. The males' hectocotylus has a ventral crest which is created by the fusion of the protective membrane with the ventral series of papillae and this crest completely obscures the conical shape of the papillae. The mantle is rounded posteriorly and lacks the posterior tail-like lobe while the fins are positioned on the rear of the mantle and extend to the posterior tip of the mantle. Their eggs are small and the males' spermatophore has a short cement body. They do not possess photophores. The two subgenera are distinguished by the hectocotylus which in "Loliolus" encompasses the entire arm and there are no unmodified suckers while in "Nipponololigo" the arm is only partly hectocotylsed and has normal suckers at its base.
Species.
The following species are classified as belonging to "Loliolus":

The Arrival (video game)

The Arrival is a 1997 adventure game developed by Enteraktion and published by Live Interactive. It was released on Mac and Windows. It's an adaption of the film of the same name.
Plot and gameplay.
The plot takes place ten years after the unsuccessful alien invasion as depicted in the film, where the extraterrestrials have kidnapped the player, who must escape while avoiding detection.
The game's over 400 backgrounds depict the planet plus it surrounding moons.
Played in the first-person with full movement, the game's puzzles have a science fiction theme. The game has a hint system, and is non-linear.
Reception.
Tap Repeatedly described the game as both fun and compelling. Quandary felt seeing the film was not a requirement to enjoy the video game, which they saw as a positive. GameSpot thought the title was let down by its puzzles and soundscape. Just Adventure wrote that the game would provide mind-numbing passing of the time, while not being good in any sense. Mac Gamer deemed it a disappointing follow-up to the film.

Lolliguncula is a genus of squid from the family Loliginidae from the eastern Pacific and western Atlantic, known as brief squid. The genus is divided into two subgenera "Lolliguncula" and "Loliolopsis". They are rather small squids with a maximum mantle length of 120mm, that inhabit shallow warm seas, although some species have been recorded in areas of low salinity. They are typified by having a short mantle, which is round at the posterior; and fins that are broader than long, but which have no posterior lobes. The males produce spermatophores with a long cement body and they lack a ventral crest on their hectocotylus. Their suckers have square teeth which ring the entire margin or are placed distally. The males do not have enlarged suckers on the left ventral arm. The tentacular club is expanded and contains suckers in four series. The two subgenera differ in the morphology of the hectocotylus.

Khan is a 2017 Pakistani drama serial directed by Ali Faizan, produced by Babar Javed and written by Syed Atif Ali. It stars Noman Ijaz, Atiqa Odho and Shaista Lodhi in lead roles, and aired every Sunday at 8:00 PM. Later, it moved to Friday 9:00 PM. It was the second drama to star Shaista Lodhi after her first series "Waada."
Plot.
Khan holds great influence in making and demolishing the government. He happens to be a social worker, a caring husband, a doting father, and a caretaker of his sister. Not only this, he still remembers his ex-lover in a sincere manner but very few people are aware of Khan’s dark personality.
Khan was born and brought up in a village where his parents served for a feudal family. Back in the days, he developed feelings for Sarwat, a girl in his neighborhood who had similar feelings for him. Their love seemed like an unbreakable bond but fate has something else in store.
In an unfortunate circumstance, the son of the feudal lord kidnapped Sarwat, looted her of her honor and killed a person who tried to stop him. In a bid to protect his own son, the feudal lord pressurizes Khan to claim responsibility of the murder and promises for his bail. Khan appears in the police station and accepts the crime of murder, without knowing that he is also accepting rape of his love interest. 
When Sarwat visits Khan in the police station, she asks him of the real culprit he is saving and spits on his face. This act jolts Khan’s ego and a volcano of revenge erupts in his mind. The emerging circumstances take Khan far away from his lover and he then finds about his real enemies. A resourceful person in jail frees Khan from police custody and takes oath from Khan to work for the underworld. 
Khan releases from prison with a single mission— gather unparalleled power, top-secrets of government officials and cut the throats of his opponents. He emerges as a billionaire; a plutocrat and an underworld don, who is a social activist for the world but a game changer from behind. When he finds that his former lover is married to his rival, sweet memories from their past start hurting Khan even more.
Production.
The drama was produced by Babar Javed and was one of the most expensive dramas of Pakistan's television history.

FS Class E.621

The FS Class E.621 was a class of five electric locomotives of the Italian State Railways (FS). They were rebuilt in 1947 from FS Class E.620, which was originally built in 1925. The main change was conversion from 650 V DC third rail to 3,000 V DC overhead line power supply.
Overview.
The locomotives were built in 1925 by the Officine Meccaniche Reggiane, reusing electrical parts from withdrawn railcars. There were two 3-axle bogies and six traction motors, giving a maximum speed of 85 km/h. The motors were nose-suspended and geared to the axles.
The rebuild was done to enable the locomotives to work under a 3,000-volt overhead line power supply and to cope with a post-war shortage of locomotives. In order to use the electrical equipment, and the 650-volt motors, without excessive modifications, the metadyne system was adopted. This halved the line voltage of 3,000 volts to 1,500 volts. The 1,500 volt supply was then fed to the motors in series pairs, giving 750 volts per motor. The power output was increased from 950 kW (continuous) to 1,350 kW (1 hour rating).

Tell-tale (sailing)

A tell-tale, also known as a tell-tail, in a nautical or sailing context, is a piece of yarn or fabric attached to a sail, a stay, or any rigging on a sailboat. Typically, a tell-tail is on a port and a starboard stay.
Tell-tales attached to a sail are used as a guide for trimming (adjusting) a sail. On the mainsail tell-tales may be placed on the leech (aft edge) and when trimmed properly should be streaming backwards while on a beat (upwind). When placed on the luff (forward or mast edge of the mainsail) they are used to indicate that the sail is luffing or coming head to wind. The solution is to bear away from the wind or sheet in. 
On the jib there may be tell-tales on both sides of the luff of the sail. As a general guide, the windward tell-tale should stream aft (backwards) with an occasional lift, the leeward front tell-tail should stream aft when on a beat to windward. If one tell-tale begins to spiral, it is indicating the sail has detached air flow on that side. To correct this the sail needs to move towards the opposite side. "Tiller to tattling tail" is a good phrase to remember which direction to push the tiller when the tail is spiraling. Alternatively, the sail itself can be sheeted in or out towards the tell-tale which is not streaming. For example, a luffing windward telltale would indicate an under-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to sheet in that sail. A luffing leeward telltale would indicate an over-trimmed sail, requiring the crew to ease the sheets for that sail.
They are used both sides of the jib.
A tell-tale compass or repeating compass is a special compass installed in the ceiling of a cabin, and can be read from below or above deck. According to "Moby-Dick", a tell-tale refers to the cabin-compass, "because without going to the compass at the helm, the captain, while below, can inform himself of the course of the ship."
Types.
There are three types of telltale:
Draft telltales tend to be made from wool. Leech and shroud telltales are usually made from ribbon. 
Reading draft telltales.
If the sails are under-trimmed or the vessel is are pointing too high then the telltales on the inside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the ones on the outside will stream aft. If the sails are over-trimmed or the vessel is sailing too low then the telltales on the outside of the sail will stall/lift whilst the inside ones will stream aft.

2003 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year

The 2003 UK &amp; Ireland Greyhound Racing Year was the 78th year of greyhound racing in the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Summary.
The industry suffered a huge double blow with the closure of Catford and the English Greyhound Derby fiasco. Catford Stadium, owned by GRA was closed with little warning. The last meeting was on the 5 November leaving the staff, trainers and many others redundant.
Trainers John Simpson, Tony Taylor, Maxine Locke and John Walsh moved to Wimbledon, Keston based Steve Gammon left for Crayford, Sonja Spiers and Kevin Connor went to Sittingbourne and Mark Lavender switched to Portsmouth. Racing Manager Derek Hope was able to take up the same position at Wimbledon soon after because Simon Harris had left for Coventry Stadium bookmaker John Humphreys, who had stood in the main ring since 1966 and sponsored the Gold Collar for 18 years, retired.
The 2003 English Greyhound Derby took place as usual with the final being held on 28 June. The final resulted in the disqualification of Droopys Hewitt, trained by Andy Iaonnou a first season trainer and former head man to Nick Savva. A sample taken by the stewards (the usual practice) was tested as positive and following a six-month court battle the National Greyhound Racing Club stewards finally prevailed and stripped the Derby title from Droopys Hewitt and awarded it to second place Farloe Verdict. The winner Farloe Verdict received £75,000 and the disgraced Iaonnou was banned from the sport.
The 2003 Irish Greyhound Derby suffered no such troubles and was won by Climate Control.
Charlie Lister was Greyhound Trainer of the Year, it was the first time he had taken the honour despite all of his previous success. Brian Clemenson landed the trainers championship for the second successive year. The title of greyhound of the year went to Tims Crow.
Tracks.
Dundalk officially opened their new Dundalk Stadium on 29 November 2003 to the cost of €11 million. The minister for sport John O'Donoghue conducted the opening.
William Hill bookmakers purchased Brough Park and it underwent major investment, similar to that of Sunderland, which William Hill had acquired the year before.
Auchinleck in East Ayrshire, a major independent (unlicensed track) closed after seventy years racing. The track was the birthplace of famous Scottish bookmaker Fearless Freddie Williams who had his first pitch there many years ago.
Competitions.
Former Springbok champion Rossa Ranger set a new track record over 385 hurdles at Crayford recording a remarkable 23.36, faster than the flat heats of the Rosebowl on the same night. However he failed to make it past the Grand National first round. The event went to Selby Ben continuing Tommy Foster's success in the hurdle classic. Charlie Lister lifted the Scottish Greyhound Derby with new Irish acquisition Micks Mystic. Shelbourne Star lost his St Leger title after a positive test.
News.
There was continued debating on two issues; whether a levy should be paid to the sport in place of the Bookmakers contributions and how to increase funding in welfare to ensure that the industry could meet and exceed the requirements set by DEFRA and the Animal Welfare Bill.
Trainer Joe Cobbold died after a long battle with cancer aged 71, his son Trevor Cobbold had died nearly ten years previous with cancer; the Utopia kennels had produced countless champions under the 'Decoy' prefix.
Roll of honour.

Ron Withell

Ronald William Withell (9 March 1916 – 14 May 1998) was a New Zealand amateur boxer, who represented his country at the 1938 British Empire Games, and won two national amateur titles.
Early life.
Born on 9 March 1916, Withell was the eldest son of William Withell and Sarah Jane Withell (née Wilkinson), who farmed at Winchmore, near Ashburton.
Withell took up amateur boxing in 1937, and won the New Zealand heavyweight title that year in only his eighth competitive bout, having beaten Morrie McHugh in the semi-final. He was then selected to represent New Zealand in the heavyweight division at the 1938 British Empire Games, but his lack of experience told, and he was defeated in his opening bout when he was knocked out in the first round by South African Claude Sterley, who went on to win the silver medal.
Career.
Withell won the national amateur light-heavyweight title in 1939, before enlisting to serve in the New Zealand forces during World War II. Withell had a record of 24 amateur bouts in New Zealand, for 21 wins, on draw and two losses. He served with the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) in Egypt, where he won the Army light-heavyweight boxing Middle East forces title, and was a member of the 2NZEF brass band at Maadi Camp, playing the euphonium.
Withell returned to New Zealand in early 1944, and, after the war, took up a rehabilitation farm at Leeston, where he was active with the local brass band, as a boxing trainer and in the Returned Services' Association (RSA). After selling the farm in 1955, Withell rejoined the army, based at Burnham Camp, where he was a storeman and clerk. In 1956, he was promoted from private to lance corporal, and he retired from the army in 1960. He then lived near Weedons, training horses for harness racing, and working as a prison officer for 14 years at Paparua Prison. He served on the executive of the Paparua RSA, including as its president between 1981 and 1982, and was later the branch patron.
Family life.
He was twice married: firstly to Ethel Joyce Neame in 1944—with whom he had two children—until her death from accidental drowning in 1956; and later, from 1971, to Authie May Anderson.
Death.
Withell died on 14 May 1998, and was buried at Ellesmere Cemetery.

Elisabeth Zaisser

Elisabeth "Else" Zaisser (born Elisabeth Knipp: 16 November 1898 – 15 December 1987) was a teacher who became secretary of state and then in the East Germany.
Between 1949 and 1989 more than 130 government ministers were appointed in the German Democratic Republic. Only four were women (and one of those, Margot Honecker, was married to the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party - the leader of the country). The first of the four, appointed in April 1953, was Elisabeth Zaisser.
Life.
Provenance and early years.
Elisabeth Auguste Knipp was born in Essen. Her family were from nearby Düsseldorf. Her father is variously described as a shipping clerk, a merchant and/or a businessman. She attended a Catholic junior school between 1905 and 1908, and then a middle school for girls till 1915. From then till 1918 she attended the . During 1918/19 she qualified in Essen as a teacher, and embarked in a teaching career there. She withdrew from teaching when she married Wilhelm Zaisser on 6 June 1922 and is described in one source as a "housewife" ("Hausfrau") between 1922 and 1932. Those years were not uneventful for her, however.
Family and politics.
The couple's daughter, Renate, was born during the first half of 1924. Wilhelm Zaisser was an energetic Communist Party activist, and in 1926 Elisabeth joined the party. That was also the year in which the family relocated to Berlin. In 1927 Wilhelm Zaisser was recruited by the Comintern to work on their behalf in China where according to one source he was a co-organiser of the Guangzhou Uprising. Elisabeth Zaisser relocated to Mukden (as Shenyang is identified in most western sources from that time) in 1928 in order to join her husband. They left China in 1930 and returned to the west: there was a four-month stop-over in Moscow before they settled in Berlin, where she worked for the local party in the Köpenick quarter of the city between 1930 and 1932.
Soviet exile.
In April 1932, accompanied by her daughter, and in response to a party instruction, she went back to Moscow. Her husband returned to the Soviet capital from a two-year assignment in Prague at about the same time. In early September she became a teacher at the Karl Liebknecht School, a German language elementary school for the children of German refugees in Moscow at which she continued to work for a year or so. At the same time she embarked on a three-year study course with the Moscow-based "Julian Marchlewski" Communist University of the National Minorities of the West which evidently combined evening classes with correspondence based study. Meanwhile, the Nazis took power back in Germany at the start of 1933 and rapidly transformed the country into a one-party dictatorship. Elisabeth Zaisser would spend Germany's twelve Nazi years living in the Soviet Union, supporting herself with a succession of teaching jobs.
Between 1934 and 1946 Zaisser was responsible for German language teaching at the Moscow State Pedagogical Institute, where she was also able to pursue further studies on her own account. She undertook work as an editor for the "Moscow Teaching Books Publisher" and for the institution responsible for national university curricula. In addition, she taught German at the Institute of Red Professors ("Институт красной профессуры") between 1934 and 1937. In 1938 she took over for a year as head of the Department of German Philology at the Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages in Gorky (as Nizhny Novgorod had been renamed in 1932). She returned to Moscow in 1939, heading up the department for German language and translation courses for with the Party Central Committee. In 1940 she took Soviet citizenship. Along with her work for the Central Committee, between 1941 and 1942, and again from 1944 till 1947, she was in charge of the graduate-level courses at the Red Army's "Military Institute for Foreign Languages".
In June 1941 the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany ended abruptly when the Germans launched a massive invasion, triggering what came to be known in the Soviet Union as the "Great Patriotic War". On 20 October 1941 Moscow was declared to be in a state of siege. By that time thousands of Muscovites, including many longstanding German political exiles, had been evacuated. Elisabeth Zaisser was evacuated to the south at the start of October 1941, first to Stavropol and later to Engels. The period of greatest threat to Moscow appears to have lasted till the Autumn of 1942, when Zaisser returned to the city. For five months during 1942/43 she worked as a translator for the Soviet Union's National Broadcasting Committee ("Государственный вещательный комитет"). She also authored a number of teaching books on German language and grammar.
Soviet occupation zone.
War ended in May 1945, leaving the large central portion of Germany surrounding Berlin administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Sources differ as to whether it was in 1946 or 1947 that the Zaissers returned to Germany. Elisabeth lost little time in joining the newly formed Socialist Unity Party ("Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands" / SED) which had been created through a contentious political merger in April 1946, and was now well on the way to becoming the ruling party in a new kind of German one-party dictatorship. She took a position with the at the University of Halle where she also took on a teaching contract on Soviet Literature.
German Democratic Republic.
In October 1949 Zaisser switched to the "TH Dresden" (as that institution was known at that time), appointed "Professor of Soviet Pedagogical Methodology for Russian Teaching" ("Professorin für Sowjetpädagogik und Methodik des Russisch-Unterrichts"). Her time in Dresden was brief, however, since on 1 January 1950 she was appointed director at the "Central Institute of German Pedagogy" in (East) Berlin. She also became editor of , a monthly journal with a focus on school education.
Also in 1950 she became a Secretary of state at the . In July 1952 she succeeded Paul Wandel as Minister for Education. Early April 1953 it was reported that she had led a high level East German government delegation to Budapest in order to take part in the Hungarian National Day celebrations. She relinquished the ministerial post "at her own wish" in October 1953. Her ministerial resignation was justified, officially, with the explanation that she had been applying her experiences of the school system in the Soviet Union without appropriately adapting them for East German conditions.
Between 1950 and 1954 Elisabeth Zaisser also sat as a member of East Germany's national parliament ("Volkskammer"). Despite her SED party membership, she sat not as a representative of the SED but as one of 20 representatives of the Democratic Women's League ("Demokratischer Frauenbund Deutschlands" / DFD). The DFD was not a conventional political party in western terms, but one of the mass organisations that received seats in the parliament based on fixed quotas assigned by the ruling party, which under the single-list voting system in operation officially secured, for its , the votes of 99.72% of those voting in the 1950 general election. Under the Leninist system in place, political power was concentrated not in parliament nor in government ministries but in the leadership of the Party Central Committee, but the parliament with its visibly broadly based membership was nevertheless important in conferring political legitimacy on the overall power structure, and ministries were necessary for implementing Central Committee decisions. Elisabeth Zaisser's ministerial resignation in 1953 and her failure to reappear as a Volkskammer member after the 1954 general election had nothing to do with her own talents or shortcomings. It was part of Wilhelm Zaisser's dramatic fall from grace in the vicious power struggles that broke out in the wake of the June uprising.
In December 1953 Elizabeth Zaisser was given the status of one , which qualified her for a small supplementary pension. She also worked between 1953 and 1983 in an editorial function with the publishing organisation, while supplementing her income through freelance translation work.

Mata Hari (video game)

Mata Hari is an adventure video game. It was released on November 21, 2008 in German-speaking territories. The game was worked on by ex-LucasArts alumni Hal Barwood and Noah Falstein.
Plot.
Real-life Mata Hari embarks on a fictional adventure in which she becomes a spy and uncovers sensitive military secrets, all in the midst of the outbreak of World War I.
Gameplay.
Primarily a point and click adventure game, the title also includes various minigames. For instance players have to perform exotic dances in order to earn money. The game allowed players to skip these dance-oriented sections.
Development.
The game was developed by Hanover-based studio 4Head Studio/Cranberry Production. DTP Entertainment published the game worldwide on its Anaconda label. A press release on April 26, 2007 listed a release date of Q1 2008 for Germany, Switzerland and Austria.
The core idea, a spy game with Mata Hari at the turn of the last century, was created by Christopher Kellner and Marc Buro. Buro, a producer at DTP, approached both Barwood and Falstein separately and pitched them a game based on Mata Hari, which after discussing the opportunity, felt was "right up our alley". The duo agreed to collaborate on the project. Barwood and Falstein were the principle designers, and fleshed out the core idea into a full-fledged game. The 4Head Studio team was led by Tobias Severin, Matthias Meyer, and Oliver Specht.
The duo, who both lived in California, were able to discuss the game at a local cafe. However, they also began to have long Skype conversations between California, Hannover and Hamburg. In August 2007, Barwood and Falstein attended a series of meetings in Hannover to review and fine-tune the design.
Critical reception.
Adventure Archiv thought that the game was short at a play time of ten hours. Adventure Treff wrote that reading the Wikipedia article of the subject of the game was more exciting than playing the game, and notes the game developers should have read it too prior to making the game. Adventure Corner felt the game's story was littered with plot holes. Game Captain felt the game came across as simple and superficial. Adventures Unlimited thought the game fell below expectations. Jeux Video described the title as one that exudes freshness, maturity and remarkable intelligence.

<doc id="56674002" url="?curid=56674002" title="Tell-tale (bridges)">
Tell-tale (bridges)

A tell-tale, also known as a bridge warning, is a series of ropes suspended over railway tracks to give warning to the engineer, and more importantly the brakeman who may be scampering across the tops of the cars, that the train is approaching a low-clearance obstacle, such as a tunnel or a bridge. In the US, a standard tell-tale design had ropes on centers for a width of over the track, the bottom of the ropes lower than the height of the obstruction, and placed at least before the obstruction.
Tell-tales are also used to warn trucks and other tall vehicles of low-clearance bridges on roads and highways. In this context, chains are used instead of ropes, and it is frequently the sound of the chains knocking against the truck that alerts the driver of trouble.

Industria Argentina Vehículos de Avanzada

Industria Argentina de Vehículos de Avanzada (IAVA) was a company created by the Fiat dealers of Argentina in 1971.
As Abarth did in Italy, the goal of IAVA was to provide the Argentine industry with a higher performance version of the Argentinian Fiat 128. The philosophy was to use the platform of the 128, but change the engine to a transversely mounted 1100 cubic centimeter four cylinder. With this new engine IAVA offered, in addition to the increase in power, more comfort, and even aerodynamic accessories for the 128.
IAVA also made version of the Fiat 147 which was named Fiat 147 Sorpasso. They also made versions of the Fiat 133 called the Fiat 133 IAVA and Fiat 133 Top respectively.
Later, IAVA created a buggy called the Kikito Buggy but produced less than 25 units, along with 2 berlinetta-type prototypes. It also made a motor for boats based on an SSB structure and a prototype for the firm Mara.
IAVA filed for bankruptcy in 1985 and ceased operations shortly after.

Santara dynasty

Santara or Bhairarasa is a medieval ruling dynasty of Karnataka, India. The area covered by their kingdom included territories in the Malenadu region as well as the coastal districts of Karnataka. Their kingdom had two capitals. Karkala in the coastal plains and Kalasa in the Western ghats. Hence the territory they ruled was also known as the Kalasa-Karkala kingdom. The Santaras were Jains and had matrimonial relations with the Saivite Alupa royal family. The Santaras became the feudatories of the Vijayanagara Empire after its rise. During this period, the Santara ruler Veera Pandya Bhairarasa erected the monolith of Bahubali in Karkala. The dynasty passed into oblivion after invasions by the Nayakas of Keladi and later by Hyder Ali
Origins.
"Jinadatta Raya" or "Jindutt Rai", a Jain prince from Mathura in Northern India was the supposed founder of the dynasty. He is said to have migrated to the town of Humcha with an idol of the Jain deity Padmavati laying the foundation of the kingdom in Humcha. He also built the Humcha Jain temples.
Edgar Thurston mentions that the Bhairarasas or Santaras were among the powerful Bunt chiefs who seem to have exercised control over a greater part of the Tuluva country before the rise of the Vijayanagara Empire. The dynasty founded by Jinadatta appears to have split into two branches by the 12 century C.E. One branch being stationed in Kalasa and another in Hosagunda of Shimoga district. Gradually these branches shifted their capitals to Keravashe and Karkala both in the old South Canara district.
The Santaras built a number of Jain monuments and were responsible for the spread of Jainism in the Tulu Nadu and Malenadu region of Karnataka. They donated two villages for maintenance of Jain monks at "Panchakuta basadi" at Nagar taluq of Shimoga district.

Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference

The Theoretical Roman Archaeology Conference (TRAC) is an academic organisation and conference which was designed to be an arena for open discussion of archaeological theory in Roman archaeology.
History.
TRAC, organised initially by Eleanor Scott, was held for the first time in the Department of Archaeology at the University of Newcastle on 23–24 March 1991.
Historically, one of TRAC's main focuses has been on the debates surrounding Romanisation, and this dominated many of the volumes during the 1990s. However, since the early 2000s, there have been a rising number of discussions relating to post-imperial and post-colonial approaches to the Roman world.
TRAC was originally established as a one-off event, but, the interest that this conference garnered led to it becoming an annual fixture. After the initial meeting in Newcastle, TRAC has been run at many of the major archaeology departments in the UK and has even been organised at institutions in Europe and America.
TRAC was joined with RAC (the Roman Archaeology Conference), organised by the Roman Society, at Reading University in 1995.
Participants.
Many of the participants in TRAC are early career scholars or postgraduates who use the conference to outline their own original research and attempt to re-define existing models about the Roman past.
Andrew Gardner, in an article in TRAC 2005, raised the issue of a gender imbalance in the history of TRAC conferences. However, in more recent article, Eleanor Scott concluded that TRAC had given an equal platform to female archaeologists working within Roman archaeology. In the 2010s, TRAC has becoming increasingly international.
Publications.
TRAC was previously published as a set of conference proceedings. From TRAC 2017 it moved to an online open access journal, the "Theoretical Roman Archaeology Journal", published by the Open Library of Humanities.

Alda Levi Spinazzola (Bologna, 16 June 1890 – Rome, 23 June 1950) was an Italian archaeologist and art historian.
Biography.
Levi was born within a Jewish middle-class family and attended the Liceo classico Tito Livio in Padua.
In 1913 she graduated in Classical Philology and Learning sciences at Padua University. 
In 1915 she started her career as an inspector at the "Soprintendenza Archeologica di Napoli", and soon after met her future husband and opponent of Fascism, . The two were married only in 1932.
Levi moved to Bologna (1924) and then Milan (1925) and she was appointed as director of the "Ufficio distaccato della Soprintendenza alle antichità" of Turin first, and Padua thereafter. She was the only inspector of archaeology for the whole Lombardy region during the years of the building boom. 
She published many of her excavations' results in a number of journals: "Historia", "Rivista Archeologica dell'Antica Provincia e diocesi di Como", "Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità e Bullettino di Paleontologia Italiana". Furthermore, she published the "Patera di Parabiago" and a catalogue of the Greek and Roman sculptures of the Ducal palace, Mantua.
Following the publication of the Italian Racial Laws, Levi lost her job and moved to Rome, constantly in fear of deportation. After the end of the War (1945) she got her job back and she published, together with her husband, the results of the excavations in "Via dell'Abbondanza" in Pompeii. She converted to the Catholic religion and died in Rome in 1950.

Kalari (2018 film)

Kalari () is a 2018 Tamil-language action thriller film directed by Kiran and produced by Senith Keloth under the Nakshathra Movie Magic banner. The film stars Krishna, Vidya Pradeep, and Samyuktha Menon in the lead roles, while M. S. Bhaskar and Jayaprakash play pivotal roles. The soundtrack and background score were composed by V. Prasanna, while the cinematography and editing were done by R. B. Gurudev and Sathyaraj Natarajan respectively. The film was released on 24 August 2018.
Production.
Directed by debutant Kiran, the film is set in Vathuruthy in Kochi and tells the tale of a strained father-son relationship. Krishna was signed to portray a man with agoraphobia who wants to lead a peaceful life, while his abusive father, essayed by M. S. Bhaskar, was characterised as a rogue who lives life at his own will. Vidya Pradeep was selected to play Krishna’s pair, while Samyuktha Menon was signed to debut as Krishna’s sister. R. B. Gurudev handled the film's cinematography, while playback singer V. Prasanna turned music composer with this film. Kiran had filmed the project in Vathuruthy owing to its large Tamil population and its proximity to a railway track, which features throughout the film. In regard to the title, Krishna noted the film has nothing to do with kalaripayattu, the art form. He stated that "kalari" in Tamil means war, and the film dealt with the internal and external wars of his character in the film.
The shoot of the film began in January 2017 and continued throughout the year.
Release.
"The Times of India" gave the film two out of five stars and wrote that "Kalari is let down by the dated treatment. Neither the script nor the filmmaking feels fresh."

<doc id="56674309" url="?curid=56674309" title="White ethnostate">
White ethnostate

A white ethnostate is a proposed type of state in which residence or citizenship would be limited to white people, and would exclude those viewed as non-whites, such as Black people, Asian people, Indian people, Pacific Islanders, etc. In the United States, proposals for such a state are advanced by white supremacist and white separatist factions such as Ku Klux Klansmen and neo-Nazis whether through claiming a certain part or the whole of the country to have a white majority.
Historically, Australia attempted to establish a whites-only state through restriction of non-white immigration and assimilation of Aborigines in its White Australia policy. Apartheid-era South Africa made an attempt by pushing the non-white population into areas known as Bantustans, through various means including deportations and racial segregation, with the aim of establishing separate states out of the resulting ethnically cleansed areas, the largest of which would be a white state.
Proposed white ethnostates.
North America.
Historically as well as in modern times, the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon, Idaho and a portion of Montana) has been proposed by many white supremacists as a location for the establishment of a white ethnostate. This Northwest Territorial Imperative was promoted by Richard Girnt Butler, Robert Jay Mathews, David Lane and Harold Covington, the terrorist organization The Order, the neo-Nazi Christian Identity organization Aryan Nations, the white power skinhead Volksfront, and the Northwest Front, among others. The Northwest Territorial Imperative also has loose overlap with the Cascadia independence movement which also seeks to create an independent republic between the Northwest and parts of Northern California in the United States and British Columbia in Canada. Some in the far-right use the term American Redoubt to describe a similar migration to the Northwestern United States. Additionally other areas have looked into as sites for a potential white ethnostate by certain groups most notably the South and the self-proclaimed "Southern Nationalist" League of the South (LS) given the region's history of secessionism and once being an independent nation known as the Confederate States of America (1861-1865). Another example is Billy Roper's Shield Wall Network (SWN), a neo-Nazi organization located in Mountain View, Arkansas seeks to build a "white ethnostate" in the Ozark region and is affiliated with other separatist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) Knights Party located near Harrison, Arkansas, League of the South (LS) and National Socialist Movement (NSM) of the now defunct Nationalist Front. Conversely, the Ozarks have been a "hotbed" for adherents of the Christian Identity movement including the Church of Israel and various members of the Christian Patriot movement who have set up paramilitary training camps to prepare for a coming Armageddon. The defunct neo-Nazi organization Traditionalist Worker Party (TWP) led by Matthew Heimbach also sought to create a white ethnostate called "Avalon" built upon the ideological principles of Nazism, various strands of European fascism such as Legionarism and British Fascism and Eastern Orthodoxy.
South Africa.
After the end of apartheid, some Afrikaner nationalist organizations, including Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging, started to promote the idea of a Volkstaat that would be created in the Western Cape region.
Historical attempts at creating a white ethnostate.
South Africa.
During the apartheid era, the South African government, led by the National Party, attempted to turn South Africa into a whites-only state by forcing millions of Black people to move to bantustans. Post-apartheid, some Afrikaner groups such as Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) and Afrikaner Volksfront have promoted the idea of a "Volkstaat" or a homeland for Afrikaners only. The town of Orania, Northern Cape is a manifestation of the "Volkstaat" idea.
Australia.
For 72 years, from 1901 until 1973, Australia implemented a White Australia Policy to exclude people of non-European origin.
United States.
In 2013, white supremacist Craig Cobb attempted to take over the small town of Leith, North Dakota, and turn it into a neo-Nazi enclave; this failed due to Cobb's violent behavior towards Leith residents, which got him arrested. The events form the basis of the documentary "Welcome to Leith". The United States also had historical white nationalist ideas, in the form of the Naturalization Act of 1790 which would allow whites to apply for citizenship if they have lived in The United States for two years without breaking any laws. Non-White citizens as of The Johnson-Reed Act in 1924 were allowed to immigrate to America following a quota of 2% of the number of people from their race living in America in 1890. The 1952 McCarren-Walter Act revised the former 1924 act and decreased the percentage of people coming into America. It also removed the ban on immigration from Asia. Discrimination in immigration only ended legally by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965.
New Zealand.
Similar to Australia, what was dubbed 'White New Zealand Policy' saw legislation enacted that aimed to keep out Asians and other non-Europeans from immigrating to the country. After the Second World War, a 1953 Department of External Affairs memorandum set out the intent in more clear terms. The laws were relaxed only in the 1970s and the 1980s. "Our immigration is based firmly on the principle that we are and intend to remain a country of European development. It is inevitably discriminatory against Asians – indeed against all persons who are not wholly of European race and colour. Whereas we have done much to encourage immigration from Europe, we do everything to discourage it from Asia".
Nazi Germany.
Adolf Hitler's plan was to create a Nordic/Aryan superstate that would rule over most of Europe and dominate its geopolitical landscape and eradicate everyone who was not considered "pure" by the Nazis. The objective of Nazi Germany was to turn a large part of central and eastern Europe into an "Aryan" homeland by cleansing its population through the genocide and mass deportation of non-Aryans such as Jews, Slavs (i.e. Poles, Serbs, etc.), Roma/Gypsies, and homosexuals.
Rhodesia.
In 1965, then prime-minister Ian Smith declared the independence of Rhodesia to prevent Blacks from ruling the country and preserve white culture.

Ghostland

Ghostland (also known as Incident in a Ghostland) is a 2018 horror film written and directed by Pascal Laugier. "Ghostland" was shown in competition at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer, where it won three awards, including the Grand Prize.
Plot.
A woman named Pauline travels with her teenage daughters Beth and Vera to their recently-deceased aunt Clarissa's secluded home after they inherited it in her will. Beth reads an article about a string of home invasions where parents are murdered, but daughters are spared. Unbeknownst to the family, they are stalked by someone driving a candy truck.
Shortly after the women settle into the house, a large, mentally impaired man breaks in and attacks Pauline. The man drags Beth and Vera into the basement and a strange woman enters. When Beth asks what they want, the woman replies, "We just wanna play with dolls." The man assaults the girls and rapes Vera. Pauline recovers and ends up killing both home invaders while Beth watches, paralyzed with fear.
Sixteen years later, Beth is now a successful horror fiction author living in Chicago with her husband and son. She appears on a talk show to promote her new novel "Incident in a Ghostland", based on her experience that night. She receives a frantic phone call from her sister who has suffered from delusions since the trauma, begging her to return to the house where she still lives with their mother. When Beth arrives, Pauline explains that Vera remains unable to move on and continues reliving that night over and over. In the house, Beth has strange experiences and Vera claims that their tormentors are still trying to get them.
Beth finds Vera chained and made up to look like a doll. When she sees Vera flailing as if attacked by a ghost, Pauline calls an ambulance and tells Beth not to listen to Vera. Beth falls asleep waiting for her mother and ends up captured by the Candy Truck Woman. When she recovers, she discovers bruises all over her beaten face. She finds Vera also beaten up in the basement and blames her for the wounds. Vera begs her sister to face the truth. Beth finally flashes back to a memory and it is revealed that the Candy Truck Woman actually killed their mother.
Beth breaks from her imagined adulthood to realize that the Fat Man and Candy Truck Woman are still holding her and Vera captive as teenagers in Clarissa's home. The Candy Truck Woman takes Beth upstairs and dresses her like a doll, leaving her in a room littered with dolls. The Fat Man enters to begin molesting and torturing the dolls. When he gets to Beth, she fights back and flees. She frees her sister and the two of them escape the house. They make it to a road where two state troopers help them, reporting the incident to dispatch. However, both are gunned down by the Candy Truck Woman who recaptures the girls.
Beth mentally retreats back to her adulthood fantasy. At a cocktail party, she meets her idol, H.P. Lovecraft, who tells Beth that her novel is a masterpiece. Beth sees her sister screaming for help and decides to return to rescue Vera. Back in reality, she escapes from the Fat Man and initiates a violent fight with the Candy Truck Woman. Another state trooper arrives in time to gun down both the Fat Man and the Candy Truck Woman. After authorities arrive, Beth sees a vision of her mother waving at them from the house as the sisters are taken to the hospital. She looks at her antique typewriter that she threw off the window while trying to escape and tells the paramedic she likes to write stories.
Production.
"Ghostland" is a Canadian and French co-production with Canada providing 69.12% of funding and France providing 30.88%. The film was predominantly shot in Canada.
Accident.
In December 2016, actress Taylor Hickson was facially disfigured while shooting a scene for the film. She was rushed to the hospital and received 70 stitches, but was permanently scarred. In March 2018, Hickson sued the film’s production company Incident Productions over lost work as a result of the incident. Hickson claimed in the lawsuit that "in the course of shooting the scene, the director Pascal Laugier, consistently told Hickson to pound harder on the glass with her fists". While filming another take, the lawsuit states:
Hickson, in the lawsuit, states that the company failed to take "any and all reasonable steps to ensure that industry standards and practices were adhered to, including but not limited to the use of safety glass and/or stunt doubles as appropriate."
Independent of the pending lawsuits, the Winnipeg-based film company Incident Productions, Inc. pled guilty for "failing to ensure the safety and welfare of a worker under the Workplace Safety and Health Act," and was fined $40,000 by the Manitoba province.
Release.
"Ghostland" was first shown in competition on 3 February 2018 at the Festival international du film fantastique de Gérardmer. "Ghostland" won three film awards at the festival, including the Grand Prize, Audience Award, and the SyFy Award. The SyFy award was chosen by five bloggers at the festival. Frédéric Strauss of "Télérama" noted that this was the second French co-production in a row that dominated the awards at the festival with the previous years big winner being "Raw" by Julia Ducournau. The film received a theatrical release in France on 14 March 2018. In some territories, the film was released as "Ghostland" and in others as "Incident in a Ghostland".
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 54%, based on 26 reviews with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: ""Incident in a Ghost Land" may satisfy horror fans in search of a nasty kick, but it's narratively flawed and decidedly not for the squeamish." Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 44 out of 100, based on 4 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
"The Hollywood Reporter" declared the film to be a "taut—if somewhat corny—slasher flick" and it was "neither for the faint of heart nor the sharp of mind". The review noted the dialogue, finding that "for [the director's] second film in English after 2012’s "The Tall Man", he could have brushed up more on his dialogue, which rings awfully flat." Dennis Harvey of "Variety" declared that "Ghostland" "all seems slick, intense, and unpleasant in the same hollow way "Martyrs" did, because all the cruelty is so meaningless. Replacing that film’s empty pseudo-mysticism are villains for whom Laugier doesn’t bother providing any motivation or backstory." Simon Abrams of "The Village Voice" wrote that the film was a "disturbing and effective critique of misogynist torture porn," it "may sometimes play like a mindlessly gory slasher clone, but Laugier’s tormented girls consistently prove to be stronger than their brutalized bodies."

Operation Good Neighbor

Operation Good Neighbor (, "Shkhenut Tova", lit. "Good neighborliness") was a directive of the Northern Command's Division 210 of Israel Defence Forces (IDF) that was responsible for civilian aid to Syrian citizens who were affected by the Syrian Civil War.
Background.
In June 2016 the directive was established and in August its first activity took place. Since then, it carried out more than 110 types of aid operations. Coordination and control of humanitarian activities was managed by "Good Neighbor", and Division 210 forces assisted in the transport of equipment and in securing the operations. About 400 families lived in tent camps near the border and the rest had lived in villages or in open fields. About a third of the residents were displaced persons or refugees, half of whom were minors. The patients brought to Israel for treatment were mostly treated in hospitals in northern Israel, mainly at the Galilee Medical Center in Nahariya and the Rebecca Sieff Hospital in Safed.
According to the IDF, aid to Syrian civilians was motivated by both conscience and security interests. The IDF did not want to stand by in the face of the humanitarian crisis in Syria, and aid could create a less hostile environment across the border.
Gadi Eisenkot, Israeli Defense Forces’ Chief of Staff admitted that Israel supplied rebels at the border with light weapons.
Aid was given in three ways:
In 2017, a Maternity hospital was opened in the Syrian village of Bariqa, without any equipment. Following its outreach to Israel, incubators, anesthesia machines and ultrasound devices were sent. The aid was partially funded from aid organizations and partly from the state budget.
On September 13, 2018, the IDF announced the closure of "Operation Good Neighbor" following the return of the Assad government to power in the entirety of southern Syria and along the "de facto" border with Israel.

East Henry Street Carnegie Library

East Henry Street Carnegie Library, also known as the Savannah Carnegie Library, and historically as the Carnegie Colored Library, is a public library established for and by African Americans in Savannah, Georgia during the segregation era. The historic building has been preserved and renovated. It is now a branch in Savannah's Live Oak Public Libraries system. The library is an example of Prairie style architecture and is one of only two Carnegie library projects for African-Americans in Georgia. It was the local library for James Alan McPherson, who became the first African American writer to win a Pulitzer Prize and for Clarence Thomas who went on to become a judge on the United States Supreme Court. The building has won honors for its renovation and historical preservation. It is a contributing property of the Savannah Victorian Historic District.
History.
On November 1, 1903, the city of Savannah and the Georgia Historical Society partnered to open a public library on a three-year basis in Hodgson Hall on the north side of Forsyth Park in Savannah. The Black citizens of the Savannah community were prevented from using the new library. This prohibition provided the impetus for the formation of the Colored Library Association of Savannah. (The Georgia Historical Society, 2014) The Colored Library Association of Savannah formed in 1906 and operated the Savannah Colored Public Library out of the basement of Dr. Jamison, one of Savannah's prominent Black dentists of the time. Another prominent member of the association was Richard R. Wright Sr., President of Georgia State Industrial College for Colored Youth (Savannah State University). The Association's twelve founding members included many of Black Savannah's professional, business, and cultural leaders. The Colored Library Association of Savannah relied on contributions of books from their founding members, and money from local supporters to open their own library to the public.
In 1909, Andrew Carnegie offered the city of Savannah $60,000 (later raised to $75,000) for a new main library on Bull Street. (The University of Southern Mississippi) This donation encouraged the Colored Library Association to approach the philanthropist themselves. Donations from the Black community and the twelve founding members facilitated the purchase of land for a building on East Henry Street across from Dixon Park; which at that time, was home to a thriving Black middle class. The neighborhood was home to many Black teachers, doctors, lawyers and business owners. Once the land was secured, the Carnegie Foundation awarded the Colored Library Association a sum of $12,000 to build a small library. (The University of Southern Mississippi)
The Carnegie Colored Library opened on August 14, 1914. Its inaugural librarian was Charles A.R. McDowell. Though its opening day collections consisted of only 3,000 volumes, the library immediately became an indispensable community institution among Savannah's African Americans. It provided them with reading materials by Black and White authors, programs to attend, clubs to join, and space for public meetings. While the library received support from the city, it remained supervised by a separate board until 1963, when Savannah desegregated its libraries. The Carnegie Library reopened as an integrated branch of the Savannah Public Library but continued to serve a predominantly African American clientele. (The University of Southern Mississippi)
Julian deBruyn Kops, a local Savannah architect and engineer, was commissioned to design the new library. The building itself is significant not only because of the part it plays in the social history of Black Savannah, but also because of the style of which deBruyn Kops chose for it. It is one of the only examples of Prairie Style architecture within the city.
In 1915 the building was officially completed and came to be known locally as the "Carnegie Colored Public Library" because it was reserved for the African-American community, who were excluded from the other public library in town. In respect and appreciation of the assistance they received from the Carnegie grant, the name of the library was also officially changed when it was moved into Kops' building on East Henry Street. The Carnegie Colored Library which existed after this move helped to foster and support a growing Black community in downtown Savannah through the two world wars and struggles for civil rights. The Carnegie Library became a refuge and educational center for local Black children, some of whom grew up to become local representatives. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in his memoirs that he frequently used it as a boy, before the library system was desegregated. During a time of social, class, and racial segregation, the Carnegie Colored Library helped to publicize the need for education in segregated areas.
Architecture.
Live Oak Public Library System celebrating centennial anniversary documents describe the building's the Prairie architecture influences noting: "The monumental staircase leading to the main entrance on the second floor is framed by two enormous piers with sandstone orbs on small pedestals. Additionally there are four tiered brick walls with sandstone coping which flank the staircase. The corners of the piers are delineated by dark glazed bricks, a motif repeated in a horizontal band over the second floor windows and projecting brick cornice that visually divides the first and second stories. This emphasis on horizontality achieved through the coping and polychromed brickwork is a key element of the architecture of the Prairie School, pioneered by Frank Lloyd Wright and his contemporaries. The interior continues to show the influence of Wright in the geometric and floral motifs incorporated on columns and pilasters." The flat roof and second-floor staircase, as well as the ornaments on the outside and the inside lend themselves to the Prairie School. And on the whole, the entire building, inside and out reflects a coordinated geometrical approach to architecture that is unlike any other in the city.
Merger with library system after the end of segregation.
The Carnegie Colored Library was in operation on its own until the end of segregation when it then joined the larger Savannah Public Library system in 1963. With the end of segregation, the Carnegie Library joined with the larger Savannah Public Library system in 1963. This meant that African‐Americans were able to access the Bull Street Library for the first time. The cultural importance of Carnegie remained, even as the educational necessity waned. At the end of the 20th century, the Carnegie Library had slipped into disrepair and closed.
Renovation and restoration.
In 2001 the Live Oak Public Libraries set forth a campaign to renovate and expand the historic building. It closed in 1997 due to a leaking roof, water damage, and a lack of funding. A fund-raising effort began and was able to support a $1.3 million renovation which was completed. Wings on either side of the original building were built. The library also received the latest technical equipment, such as a new classroom designed to provide interactive computer learning. Collections which were moved for safety were returned, and expanded to a collection of 3,000, with an emphasis on the Harlem Renaissance. The restructuring was done in the same architectural style as the building was initially erected in, and all additions would adhere to the library's historical roots. The addition was completed in 2003 on the 90th anniversary of its first opening. After the renovation the library received multiple awards from organizations on both the state and national levels. In 2004 the library was awarded by the Historic Savannah Foundation the Historic Preservation Award. In 2005 the building received multiple awards from the Georgia Trust for Historic Preservation; the 2005 Georgia Preservation Award, as well as the 2005 Marguerite Williams Award which recognizes one project which had the greatest impact on preservation in the state. Also in 2005 the library won the National Preservation Award from the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The centennial of the library was held in August 2014, when a historical marker was erected in front of the building denoting the history of the location and building for the Savannah community.

Georgia Washington Middle School

Georgia Washington Middle School was a public middle school in Montgomery, Alabama, until it was acquired by the school system of Pike Road.
History.
Founding and early history.
The school was founded in 1893 by Georgia Washington (1851-1952), a woman who was born a slave in Virginia; she was sold along with her mother, away from her father. After emancipation she graduated from Hampton University (1882), an HBCU in Virginia where she then taught for a while before moving to Mount Meigs, Alabama, and starting a small school there called the People's Village School. At the time, Mount Meigs was a rural area with a significant African-American population, and the school's first building was a small cabin, 12 by 13 feet, where Washington had four boys as students. Washington is buried on the school grounds.
Subsequent history.
By 1916 enrollment had reached 225. Washington herself retired in 1936, and after her death in 1952 the school was renamed for her. In 1943 the school was deeded to Montgomery Public Schools. It became a junior high school in 1970, and a middle school in 2012. By 2017 enrollment was 600. In 2018, controversy arose because the Montgomery school system, headed by an interim superintendent while under state oversight, announced the sale of the school to the Pike Road Municipal school system; a lawsuit to stop the sale was filed by the Alabama Education Association on behalf of three teachers and parents. The sale would mandate that the school keep its name and that her grave be maintained.

Edgar Humann

Edgar Eugène Humann (7 May 1838 – 9 May 1914) was a French naval officer.
He rose through the ranks to Admiral, and commanded the Far East naval division during the Paknam incident.
He served as Chief of Staff of the French Navy in 1894–95.
Early years (1838–75).
Edgar Eugène Humann was born on 7 May 1838 in Paris.
His parents were Jules Humann (1809–1857), a diplomat, minister plenipotentiary and peer of France, and Isabelle Hortense Guilleminot (born 1811).
He joined the navy in 1855 and was a novice pilot in Le Havre and Brazil.
He was made a Midshipman ("Aspirant") 2nd class in the port of Toulon on 1 August 1857.
He served on the "Andromède" in a campaign of the western shores of America.
Humann was promoted to Midshipman 1st class on 1 September 1859.
In 1860 he was on the "Bretagne" in the Training Squadron (escadre d'évolution) during the Syrian campaign().
Humann was appointed Sub-lieutenant ("Enseigne de vaisseau") on 1 September 1861.
He was gunnery officer on the "Ville-de-Paris" under Admiral Charles Rigault de Genouilly in 1863, then the admiral's aide de camp. 
He was appointed Lieutenant ("Lieutenant de vaisseau") on 13 August 1864.
He served as aide de camp from 1865 to 1867 with the admiral commanding the China Sea Division. 
On 6 March 1868 Humman was elected a member of the Société de géographie.
He was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 29 December 1866, and an Officer of the Legion of Honour on 21 January 1871.
In February 1871 he was gunnery officer under Admiral Louis Pierre Alexis Pothau, Minister of the Navy.
In January 1873 he commanded the "D'Estaing" on the Newfoundland station, then in 1874 commanded the "Adonis" on the same station.
In 1875 he was a member of the Newfoundland Fisheries Commission.
Commander and captain (1875–89).
On 3 August 1875 Humann was promoted to Commander ("Capitaine de frégate").
He studied at the school of underwater defenses in Rochefort in 1877.
From 1878 to 1880 he commanded the "Hirondelle" in the Escadre d'évolutions.
He was promoted to Captain ("Capitaine de vaisseau") on 10 July 1882.
He was second in command of the "Clorinde" in the Newfoundland division.
In 1883 he commanded the "Richelieu" in the "Escadre d'évolutions".
On 1 January 1886 he was on the battleship "Colbert" as Chief of Staff of the Escadre d'évolutions under Vice-Admiral Louis Lafont(), the commander in chief.
In 1887 he returned to the Newfoundland station commanding first the "Clorinde" and then the "Clochetterie", using diplomacy to resolve the many problems of the fisheries.
Admiral (1889–1903).
Humann was appointed Rear admiral ("Contre Amiral") on 12 November 1889.
He was made a member of the Naval Council and a member of the Lighthouse Commission.
He was promoted to Commander of the Legion of Honour on 30 December 1890.
In 1892 he was placed in command of the Far East naval division.
At this time Britain and France were extending their spheres of influence in Southeast Asia.
The British had taken control of Burma and the trans-Mekong Shan States, while France had established a protectorate over Annam (central and southern Vietnam).
The independent kingdom of Siam (Thailand) lay between the two colonial powers, and could potentially serve as a buffer.
In February 1893 Théophile Delcassé, head of the French colonial office, declared that the Mekong River defined the western limit of the French sphere of influence in Indochina.
Tensions rose between Siam and France with armed clashes in May and June.
In late June three French gunships appeared at the mouth of the Menam River to the south of the Siamese capital of Bangkok.
Humann commanded the French fleet.
The Siamese refused permission for the French to pass beyond the forts at Paknam.
When they proceeded anyway the forts opened fire and grounded one of the ships.
The other two continued upstream and anchored off Bangkok.
On 18 July 1893, while the French warships "Inconstant" and "Comète" continued to threaten Bangkok, the French foreign minister Jules Develle served an ultimatum on Siam demanding recognition of French rights to the left bank of the Mekong and payment of reparations.
On 30 July Humann ordered the commander of the British H.M.S. "Linnet" to leave the position he had taken in front of Bangkok.
This incident marked the peak of tension in the Anglo-French confrontation.
The French soon apologized and the two powers settled down to protracted negotiations over buffer zones and borders.
The French government claimed that Humann's actions were in defiance of (or due to failure to receive) orders instructing him not to enter the river. However, instead of being reprimanded, Humann was promoted to Vice admiral on 3 February 1894.
From September 1894 to November 1895 he was Chief of the General Staff of the Navy, and Director of the Cabinet of the Minister of the Navy.
In November 1896 Humann was commander of the Mediterranean reserve squadron.
In October 1897 he was given command of the Western and Levantine Mediterranean Squadron, with the battleship "Brennus" as his flagship.
In October 1898 he was made Inspector General of the Navy.
He was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 11 July 1899.
In 1902 he was Chairman of the Council of Marine Works.
He retired from active duty in May 1903.
Marriage, children and death.
On 27 April 1883 Humann married Isabelle de Bouthillier-Chavigny (1858–1925).
Their children included Odette (1884–1954), Marie (born 1886), Jean (1887–1904), Edgar (1888–1947), Henri (1890–1914), Joseph (1891–1957), Septime (born 1892) and Georges Odette Guilleminot (1895–1916).
Odette married the industrialist François de Wendel in 1905.
Edgar Humann died in the morning of 9 May 1914 in the 7th arrondissement of Paris.
He is buried in the family tomb in Père Lachaise Cemetery.

The Jeithi people lived in an area, characterized by eucalyptus woodland interspersed with stands of native pine, between the Murray River and south-southwest of Wagga Wagga, estimated by Norman Tindale to cover some . They ranged from the west of Tocumwal to near Howlong, their northern reaches extending to Lake Urana, Jerilderie and Lockhart. Their tribal lands took in areas of both the Yanko and Billabong creeks.
Social organization.
Little is known of the tribe, other than that they were composed of several clans with a moiety system.

Aymon of Ortinge, also known as Amanieu d'Ortigue or Amanieu de l'Artigue, was a French mercenary captain during the Hundred Years War. His story is mentioned in the Chronicles of Froissart
He was an adventurer of Gascony origins, perhaps from the hamlet of Ortigues in the commune of Cézac.
After the Treaty of Brétigny Hagre and his men found themselves unemployed and so they joined the 30 so-called Tard-Venus bandit groups, that ranged the French country side pillaging towns.
On May 11, 1369, Louis Duke of Anjou had Amanieu d'Ortigue, Noli Pavalhon and Guyonnet de Pau, beheaded and quartered, because they had conspired with the bandits Le Petit Meschin and Perrin de Savoie, to deliver the duke to the English.

Tullynamoltra

Tullynamoltra () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Tullynamoiltra.
Geography.
Tullynamoltra is bounded on the north by Altinure townland, on the west by Altachullion Upper and Tullyloughfin townlands, on the south by Tullandreen townland and on the east by Drumbeagh townland. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan) and dug wells. Tullynamoltra is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 93 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. 
Maps of the townland drawn in 1813-1814 are in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, which depicts the townland as "Tullinamortlough".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list six tithepayers in the townland.
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland-"The soil is light...There is a trigonometrical station near the centre of the townland, 514 feet above the level of the sea."
In 1841 the population of the townland was 43, being 22 males and 21 females. There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 43, being 24 males and 19 females. There were six houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists three landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 35, being 19 males and 16 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 33, being 20 males and 13 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 43, being 17 males and 26 females. There were eight houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 38, being 16 males and 22 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are ten families listed in the townland.

Thomas W. Conway

Reverend Thomas W. Conway was assistant commissioner of the Freedmen Bureau in Alabama and Louisiana during the Reconstruction era that followed the American Civil War. Freedmen's Bureau activities in Louisiana began on June 13, 1865 when the Bureau's commissioner, Oliver O. Howard, appointed Chaplain Thomas W. Conway as the state's assistant commissioner. He published a report for that year, "The Freedmen of Louisiana: Final Report of the Bureau of Free Labor, Department of the Gulf, to Major General Canby, Commanding" (1865). Another seven assistant commissioners would later hold this office. 
Background.
Conway had served as superintendent of freedmen in the Union Army's Department of the Gulf. In that role he tried to organize work which the Army needed done. In April 1865, he was given command of the Freedmen Bureau's Alabama operations as interim Freedmen's Bureau assistant commissioner for the state. Amid the disruption of the closing days of the war, Conway reported on the horrible conditions African Americans faced in the South. Often having left plantations when emancipated, they faced a lack of housing and food, and brutal attacks by angry whites. He appealed for funding from the North. 
In May 1865 Conway adopted a set of labor regulations he had drafted for Louisiana while under the authority of Major General Stephen Hurlbut. It was an attempt to set up rules for the new free labor market.
In 1866 Conway wrote to the Chamber of Commerce of the state of New York seeking support for a trip to England. He planned to seek capital investments for cotton cultivation projects which he said would benefit White and Black residents of Louisiana and help calm social tensions. He issued a series of orders regarding abandoned lands, sick refugees and freedmen, as well as other issues under the Freedmen Bureau's purview. Conway supervised the opening of the Abraham Lincoln School on the campus of the University of Louisiana (predecessor to Tulane University), a school for African Americans.
After passage of the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, Conway was no longer assigned to the Freedmen Bureau, but he remained in contact with Howard. He had introductory letters from Hulbert for a tour of Bureau activities in the South. He reported on assistance that the Bureau and its officials were providing to the Union League.
Conway was involved in Republican Party organizing in Louisiana during the Reconstruction era. In the contentious state elections for 1868, he supported Henry C. Warmoth for governor, who was a white Northerner considered a carpetbagger by some Republicans in the state. Conway criticized Dr. Louis Charles Roudanez of New Orleans, who published "The New Orleans Tribune". Roudanez was part of the community of men who had been free people of color before the war, and he had been educated in Paris and at top American schools for his medical degree. The "Tribune" was the first daily black newspaper in the United States; it strongly supported the Republican Party and promoted the franchise for all African Americans. Roudanez supported local candidates over those from the North. 
Conway lobbied in Washington D.C. with the national party to switch from Roudanez's paper to the "Republican", which supported Warmoth, as the party's official journal.

Violin Concerto (Ries)

The Violin Concerto in E minor, Op. 24 by Ferdinand Ries, was composed around 1810 while the composer was living in Bonn. It appears to have been written for his father, Franz Anton Ries, who gave the first (and only known) performance of the work at a concert in Bonn on 15 December 1810.
Following the performance, Ries started to revise the work with the intent of publishing it as his Op. 24., However for reasons unknown, this did not take place until 1885, when the firm Ries &amp; Erler published it for Violin and Piano in 1885.
For many years it was believed that the orchestral parts for the concerto were lost, however two manuscript copies of the parts, one by Ferdinand Ries, the other by a copyist, were discovered in the Berlin State Library.
It is scored for violin solo, double woodwind, two horns, two trumpets, timpani and strings.

Floros Konstantinou

Floros Konstantinou (; 8 October 1952 – 19 February 2018) was a Greek politician, historian and economist, who served as a Member of the Parliament and Deputy Minister of Agriculture with PASOK. He was a graduate of Political Sciences and a holder of two doctoral degrees, the first with the rural economy and the second in history of Hellenism in Romania.
Born in 1952 in Kalambaki, Drama. Sixth child of the refugees Fotis and Stergianis Konstantinou, he grew up in Kalambaki where he finished high school. He studied political science at the Panteion University between 1972 and 1976 where he participated at the Athens Polytechnic uprising against the "greek military junta". After the end of the dictatorship (24 July 1974) and the establishment of the Third Hellenic Republic he became a political activist within the university with the political group "Friends of Andreas Papandreou" which, later on, was renamed as "PASP" which was the student political party of the "Panhellenic Socialistic Movement". Then he graduated and because of his outstanding results (Grade: "Excellent", 10/10) he was awarded a scholarship for a doctorate in the field of agricultural economics from the Bucharest Academy of Economic Studies, which he obtained. In 1980-1981, he moved to Brussels and followed a master in political science at the Universite Libre de Bruxelles.
From 1 January 1981 he was a member of YEPEK (PASOK Representation Office in the European Parliament). He was first elected MP for PASOK for Drama in October 1981 and has since been elected until 1996. Since 1984 he has been a member of the Central Committee of the Movement and has also served as a member and secretary of the PASOK Cooperative Guild.
From October 1993 to September 1995, he was Deputy Minister of Agriculture in the last government of Andreas Papandreou. He handled Agriculture and Fisheries issues in the European Union, especially in the first half of 1994, when Greece held the presidency of the EU and patented over 150 products as PDO and PGI (oils, cheeses, fruits, legumes, etc.), including the Greek Feta. In the period 1996–1997 he was a consultant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and then a consultant at "SEKAP" industry. He published two books on Greek agriculture within the framework of the European Union ("Greek Agriculture and the International Environment" by Livani's Publishing) and regularly wrote to the Greek Press.
In 2000–2004, he was last elected for the last time as an MP of PASOK for Drama and in the period 2001–2004 he was Parliamentary Spokesman of the party. During the period 2006–2013 he made his second doctoral thesis at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki on "The economic presence of Greeks in Romania from the Crimean to the First World War". Since then, he has continued the research of the presence of Hellenism in North of the Danube from the 16th to the 20th century.
He spoke Romanian, French and English. He was married to the philologist Ourania Valixoglou and their son is Stergios Konstantinou. He died on 19 February 2018.

<doc id="56674715" url="?curid=56674715" title="Boltonimecia">
Boltonimecia

Boltonimecia is an extinct genus of ant in the formicid subfamily Sphecomyrminae, and is one of only two genera placed in the tribe Zigrasimeciini. The genus contains a single described species, Boltonimecia canadensis, and is known from a single Late Cretaceous fossil which was found in Canada. The type species was originally described as a species of the extinct genus "Sphecomyrma" under the combination Sphecomyrma canadensis.
History and classification.
"Boltonimecia" is known from a single adult fossil, the holotype, specimen number "CAS 330" entombed in an amber chunk. At the time of the genus description, the specimen was residing in the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes, in Ottawa, Canada. The described specimen is of a worker caste adult which has been preserved as an inclusion in a transparent orange chunk of Canadian amber. The amber specimen was recovered "in situ" from the Taber coal zone near the top of Foremost Formation around Grassy Lake which is near Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. Canadian amber has been dated to an age of approximately 79–78 million years old, placing it in the Campanian of the Late Cretaceous.
Two workers were first studied by paleoentomologist E. O. Wilson in 1985, a holotype and less complete paratype, both of which were held in the collections of the Biosystematics Research Institute in Ottawa. In the type description they were placed by Wilson as a species of "Sphecomyrma", "Sphecomyrma canadensis", with the species name a reference to the country of discovery. The similarity of visible traits between "S. freyi" and ""S." canadensis" was mentioned by Wilson in the description, but little descriptive information distinguishing the two was provided.
It was noted in 1988 by Dlussky and Fedoseeva that the original description was based mostly on measurements alone and further that the holotype and paratype workers were likely not from the same ant genus. In 1996, Dlussky noted the antennae of ""S." canadensis" differed from "S. freyi", having a longer first and fifth funicular segments, while in "S. freyi" it is the second segment which is longest.
An analysis and re-examination of the type workers was conducted by Leonid H. Borysenko of the Canadian National Collection of Insects, Arachnids and Nematodes and the results were published in a 2017 paper. While examining the holotype, Borysenko noted that most of the head along with parts of the antennae and mandibles were obscured by positioning in the amber. Sections of the specimen were re-polished and a number of new details became visible, allowing for the re-description of the extinct species into a new genus, "Boltonimecia". The genus name was coined as a patronym in honor of the myrmecologist Barry Bolton. Borysenko placed "Boltonimecia" into a new tribe of Sphecomyrminae, Zigrasimeciini along with the sister genus "Zigrasimecia". Examination of the paratype worker led Borysenko to conclude that the ant was too fragmented and no identifying characters were present, and thus not to be included as a paratype.
Paleohabitat.
Analysis of the composition of Canadian amber indicates it originated as cupressaceous resins which were deposited in lagoons and salt water marshes along the Western Interior Seaway. Based on the diversity of included Ceratopogonidae flies, Borkent in 1995 suggested the paleohabitat was a mix of salt marshes, wetland pools and moist sands. This mixture is supported by the presence of "Haplophragmoides" species foraminiferan tests, which are indicators of brackish waters, and crocodylian scutes found associated with the amber. While few vegetative remains are found associated with Canadian amber, spectroscopic analysis and rare entombed foliage indicated the cupressaceous tree which produced the amber is likely a species of "Parataxodium". "Parataxodium" is related to modern "Taxodium" and "Glyptostrobus" and shared a similar habitat preference of marshy areas.
"Boltonimecia canadensis" is one of several ant species that have been described from Canadian amber, the others include "Cananeuretus occidentalis", "Canapone dentata", "Chronomyrmex medicinehatensis", "Eotapinoma macalpini", and "Haidoterminus cippus".
Description.
The holotype worker is long with an head and a Weber's length of . Much of the body is the same coloration as the surrounding amber, while the lower half of the propodeum and underside of the gaster are a brown to black tone. Additionally the undersides of the coxae plus the upper halves of the tibiae are brown to black, while the upper surfaces of the head and pronotum are an opaque black tone. There is no distinct sculpturing to the exoskeleton surface.
The head is small and wider than long, with a generally triangular outline in dorsal view. The upper surface is thickened into a shield with a curved and raised profile and two elongated processes extend out and slightly forward from the rear of the head. The eyes are either reduced to such a degree that they are not visible, or are possibly lost all together, and no ocelli are visible. The clypeus is small and strongly curved, with the front margin that faces the inner sides of the mandibles covered in 25, long, peg-like setae. Each mandible is curved almost 90˚ with the bases covered by the edges of the clypeus lobes. On the mandible's ends are two teeth, a smaller sub-apical one and a larger apical one with a groove that likely matches the position of the opposite mandible placement when they are closed. The antennae are distinctly 11-segmented, with a curved scape that just reaches the rear margin of the head capsule when reclined.

W.L.D. Johnson Neighborhood Library

The W. L. D. Johnson Neighborhood Library is a Houston Public Library branch in Houston, Texas. It replaced the Carnegie Colored Library, a Carnegie Library established by Houston's African American community in the Fourth Ward that was demolished for Interstate Highway 45 construction in 1962. The current branch is located at 3517 Reed Road. The library is named after W.L.D. Johnson, Sr., a man who raised funds for the purchase of the Carnegie Colored Library and served on the board of directors of that library. The new library building was dedicated on June 16, 1964 and replaced the original Carnegie Colored Library.
Carnegie Colored Library.
African Americans were prohibited from accessing the Houston Lyceum and Carnegie Library, so African American leaders organized their own public library in Houston's Booker T. Washington High School in 1909. Native Houstonian Emmett J. Scott and his boss Booker T. Washington secured a Carnegie Library grant to help pay for a new building. It was designed by William Sidney Pittman, a prominent African American architect and the son-in-law of Booker T. Washington and was constructed in 1913. It faced Frederick Street.
The board overseeing the institution was composed entirely of African Americans. In 1921 the city of Houston disbanded the library board and made the library a branch of the Houston Public Library system. Charles Norton Love, an African American civil rights activist and publisher of the "Texas Freeman" helped advocate for construction and funding of the library.
Houston's public library system was desegregated in 1953. The neoclassical library building was demolished in 1962 to make way for Interstate 45 that cut through Houston's Fourth Ward.
Page 23 of Houston Lost and Unbuilt includes photos of the Carnegie Colored Library during its dedication in 1912, architectural plans, and a photo of city leaders and African American officials during demolition.
Legacy.
The Carnegie Colored Library was a turning point for library services in the segregated South. Through the work of librarian Julia Ideson and an all-black committee made up of Houston leaders, African Americans were active participants in planning and governing their own library. The Carnegie Colored Library, though it provided services that were nonexistent before, still existed and operated in a segregationist structure that provided unequal services and collections. However, the Carnegie Colored Library model "moved beyond the lobbying of local white librarians and city officials" to a national strategy in which black leaders could proclaim themselves "actors in the civic and cultural politics that influenced their city, the services it provided, and its built environment."

Peter Nourse

Peter Nourse (October 10, 1774 – March 25, 1840) was an American clergyman and librarian.
Nourse, born October 10, 1774, at Bolton, Massachusetts, was the son of Jonathan and Ruth (Barret) Nourse. He graduated from Harvard College in 1802, received the A.M. in course, and was Harvard College Librarian for three years from 1805 to 1808.
In 1810, he and his wife Polly, daughter of Rev. Caleb Barnum of Taunton, moved to Ellsworth, Maine, where, 9 September 1812, he was ordained over the newly established Congregational church. The ordination sermon was by Rev. Samuel Kendal and the charge by Ezra Ripley. Here he lived as pastor and at least part of the time as schoolmaster, until 1835, when he either was dismissed or resigned. According to Ellsworth church historian Wayne Smith, his "Unitarian, or at least 'liberal', leanings eventually created some controversy among his parishioners", resulting in a decline in membership.
His wife had died previously to this, and, as he had no children, he went to live, first with his brother, Dr. Amos Nourse, at Bath, and then with his nephew, Dr. Thomas Childs, at Phippsburg, Maine. At this place he died at the age of sixty-five, March 25, 1840. He was buried at Ellsworth.

Tullynaconspod

Tullynaconspod () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Tullynaconspod is bounded on the north by Gowlan townland, on the west by Tullyveela townland, on the south by Corrachomera townland and on the east by Owencam townland. Its chief geographical features are mountain streams, gravel pits and dug wells. Tullynaconspod is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 140 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
The origin of the name probably arose from a battle fought there. The 1930s Dúchas Folklore collection states- "A battle was fought in Crocán na gCamps, Derryconnessy, Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Crocán na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. About 100–200 years ago battles were fought in the Townlands of Tullyvella and Conspud between the dead people who fought at the battle of Crocán na gCamps. In the morning after these battles were fought, the heather would be red with blood. One night there was a fight in 
Conspud and a man heard a voice calling him by his Christian name, that a neighbour's house was on fire. He looked out and saw the neighbour's house on fire, but he did not go to it. Next day the house was not burned, but was as if nothing happened." 
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list three tithepayers in the townland (which is named Disputed Hill in the Tithe Books).
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The soil is intermixed with lime and freestone...There is no county cess levied on this townland as it is considered only a track of mountain. It is bounded on the north by a large mountain stream."
The Tullynaconspod Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 55, being 33 males and 22 females. There were nine houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 25, being 17 males and 8 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were five houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seven landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 22, being 12 males and 10 females. There were six houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 20, being 8 males and 12 females. There were four houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 34, being 16 males and 18 females. There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 27, being 15 males and 12 females. There were five houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are six families listed in the townland.

2018 ATP Finals

The 2018 ATP Finals (also known as the 2018 Nitto ATP Finals for sponsorship reasons) was a men's tennis tournament that took place at the O2 Arena in London, United Kingdom, from 11 to 18 November 2018. It was the season-ending event for the highest-ranked singles players and doubles teams on the 2018 ATP World Tour.
Tournament.
The 2018 ATP Finals took place from 11 to 18 November at the O2 Arena in London, United Kingdom. It was the 49th edition of the tournament (44th in doubles). The tournament was run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and was part of the 2018 ATP World Tour. The event took on indoor hard courts. It served as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.
The eight players who qualified for the event were split into two groups of four. During this stage, players competed in a round-robin format (meaning players played against all the other players in their group).
The two players with the best results in each group progressed to the semifinals, where the winners of a group faced the runners-up of the other group. This stage, however, was a knock-out stage. The doubles competition used the same format.

Qualification.
Singles.
Eight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:
In the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.
Provisional rankings are published weekly as the "ATP Race to London", coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP World Tour, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Futures tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the previous years Tour Finals excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:
All players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2016 in the world's top 30 are "commitment players" who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP. Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.
Players may have their ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:
If a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.
Doubles.
Eight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles. The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP. Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.

Polar (film)

Polar is a 2019 neo-noir action thriller film directed by Jonas Åkerlund and written by Jayson Rothwell, based on Víctor Santos's 2013 graphic novel "Polar: Came From the Cold". The film stars Mads Mikkelsen, Vanessa Hudgens, Katheryn Winnick, and Matt Lucas. It revolves around an aging assassin on the verge of retirement, who himself becomes targeted by his employer willing to cash in on his pension.
"Polar" was released worldwide on Netflix on January 25, 2019. The film received negative reviews from critics.
Plot.
At an undisclosed location in Chile, a former employee of Damocles; an organization of assassins, is killed by a specialist hit team consisting of Sindy; decoy, Facundo; sniper, and assault team Alexei, Kurt, and Hilde.
Duncan Vizla, known as The Black Kaiser, is a Damocles employee nearing mandatory retirement on his fiftieth birthday. By making sizeable contributions to his company retirement fund, he is owed over $8 million upon his retirement day. Unknown to him, Mr Blut, owner of Damocles, plans to sell the company and is inflating its value by murdering its retiring operatives; thus acquiring all of their retirement fund by way of a clause in their contract.
Duncan lives in a remote town in Montana where he is gradually building a relationship with his neighbor Camille. He is haunted by flashbacks of his murderous past and attempts to cultivate a normal life, to no avail. After giving an ill-fated talk at a local school about foreign countries and combat, he buys Camille a pistol and tries to teach her to shoot but she seems disturbed by the weapon.
Duncan is pressured into accepting a final contract by Vivian, a common associate of his and Blut's. He travels to Belarus to fulfil the mission where he finds it was a setup to have him killed. Returning to Montana, Duncan is hunted down by Facundo's team, via his accountant and several fake addresses. After stopping to help Sindy with an apparently broken down car, the pair return to his house where they have sex. Duncan is trapped in his house by the team but he outmatches and kills them all except for Alexei, who activates "Plan B" and kidnaps Camille. Duncan discovers this from Alexei's girlfriend "Junkie" Jane and seeks the help of his old friend Porter, who instead betrays and drugs him.
Duncan awakens in Blut's mansion chained in place and is tortured for three days by Blut himself for killing Hilde, whom Blut was in a relationship with. At the same time, Camille is kept in a drug-induced incoherent state by Jane. Blut stabs Duncan with a slim knife and part of the blade snaps off on Duncan's titanium hip replacement. Blut also slashes Duncan's face and stabs him in the left eye. Overnight, Duncan uses the knife shard to pick the locks on his manacles and by morning he escapes the mansion, killing many of Blut's men. He travels to Jazmin, an old friend of his, who treats his wounds and supplies him with weapons.
Duncan calls Vivian and offers himself in trade for Camille, which she accepts, but on Blut's orders, she double-crosses him and sends a hit squad, accompanied by Alexei and herself. Duncan gives Vivian a chance to walk away but she refuses, and he uses remote sentries to kill the entire force and leaves a wounded Vivian to her fate.
Duncan returns to Blut's mansion where Blut's remaining henchmen flee rather than face Duncan. Blut awaits Duncan alone but is decapitated. Duncan rescues Camille and returns to Montana where he treats her.
When he awakens one morning he finds newspaper clippings of the murder of a family many years prior, which he recognized as a hit that he, himself, carried out, albeit with bad intel, something that has haunted him ever since. The only survivor of the family was a young daughter, who grew up to be Camille. He finds himself at gunpoint and explains what happened to Camille before telling her to close her mind and pull the trigger; however, she spares him. Camille then asks Duncan to help her find out who ordered her father dead and he agrees.

Sussex in the High Middle Ages

Sussex in the High Middle Ages includes the history of Sussex from the Norman Conquest in 1066 until the death of King John, considered by some to be the last of the Angevin kings of England, in 1216. It was during the Norman period that Sussex achieved its greatest importance in comparison with other English counties. Throughout the High Middle Ages, Sussex was on the main route between England and Normandy, and the lands of the Anglo-Norman nobility in what is now western France. The growth in Sussex's population, the importance of its ports and the increased colonisation of the Weald were all part of changes as significant to Sussex as those brought by the neolithic period, by the Romans and the Saxons. Sussex also experienced the most radical and thorough reorganisation of land in England, as the Normans divided the county into five (later six) tracts of lands called rapes. Although Sussex may have been divided into rapes earlier in its history, under the Normans they were clearly administrative and fiscal units. Before the Norman Conquest Sussex had the greatest concentration of lands belonging to the family of Earl Godwin. To protect against rebellion or invasion, the scattered Saxon estates in Sussex were consolidated into the rapes as part of William the Conqueror's 'Channel march'.
Political history.
Normans (1066–1154).
Norman conquest and reign of William I (1066–1087).
Landing.
Duke William's forces landed at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and erected a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. This ensured supplies for the army, and as Harold and his family held many of the lands in the area, it weakened William's opponent and made him more likely to attack to put an end to the raiding.
Battle of Hastings.
On Friday, 13 October 1066, Harold Godwinson and his English army arrived at Senlac Hill just outside Hastings, to face William of Normandy and his invading army. On 14 October 1066, during the ensuing battle, Harold was killed and the English defeated. It is likely that all the fighting men of Sussex were at the battle, as the county's thegns were decimated and any that survived had their lands confiscated. The Normans buried their dead in mass graves. There were reports that the bones of some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside some years later. 
It was believed that it would not be possible to recover any remaining bones from the battle field area, in modern times, as they would have disappeared due to the acidic soil. However, a skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally thought to be associated with the 13th century Battle of Lewes turned out to be contemporary with the Norman invasion. Skeleton 180 had sustained six fatal sword cuts to the back of the skull and was one of five skeletons that had suffered violent trauma. Skeleton 180 was one of 123 remains found in a medieval cemetery belonging to the Hospital of St Nicholas, which was run by monks from Lewes Priory. Many of the excavated skeletons exhibited the tell tale signs of a range of diseases common in that era, including leprosy, but only Skeleton 180 had died from head injuries. The reason why historians had originally thought that skeleton 180 was involved in the battle of Lewes is because the hospital was situated at the epicentre of the conflict. What had puzzled archaeologists though, was that most of the victims of the battle had been buried in mass grave pits dug next to the battle itself; these pits had been discovered by road builders in the 19th century. Analysis now continues on the other remains found, at the site of the hospital, to try and build up a more accurate picture of who the individuals were.
Aftermath.
Sussex was the first area to be systematically 'Normanised'. After regrouping following the battle of Hastings, William headed to Kent and London with his main army while detachments were sent into Sussex to act as a rearguard. The Domesday Book of 1086 shows a significant drop in recorded values along the line of the army's route through Sussex to Lewes and on via Keymer, Hurstpierpoint, Steyning and Arundel to Chichester where they were met by secondary Norman forces that landed around Chichester Harbour or Selsey and continued westwards to Winchester in Hampshire and Wallingford, Berkshire (now Oxfordshire). A motte and bailey castle was built at Edburton soon after October 1066. A cluster of coin hoards in Sussex that were buried around 1066 suggests the coins were deposited and not recovered around the time of the Battle of Hastings.
In 1067 William sailed from Pevensey to begin his triumphant tour of Normandy. Whilst at Pevensey, William seemed to make a show of distributing lands to his followers in front of a number of Anglo-Saxon noblemen who had their lands taken away.
Consequences.
Members of King Harold Godwinson's family sought refuge in Ireland and used their bases in that country for unsuccessful invasions of England. The largest single exodus occurred in the 1070s, when a group of Anglo-Saxons in a fleet of 235 ships sailed for the Byzantine Empire. The empire became a popular destination for many English nobles and soldiers, as the Byzantines were in need of mercenaries. The English became the predominant element in the elite Varangian Guard, until then a largely Scandinavian unit, from which the emperor's bodyguard was drawn. Some of the English migrants were settled in Byzantine frontier regions on the Black Sea coast referred to as "Nova Anglia" or New England. The migrants established towns with names such as "Susaco" (or "Porto di Susacho") thought to refer to Saxons or South Saxons (i.e. Sussex), at or near modern Novorossiysk; "Londina" (New London) and New York.
The county was of great importance to the Normans; Hastings and Pevensey being on the most direct route for Normandy. It was also necessary to guard Sussex and England from attack - to prevent raids by Danes and partly to prevent attack by the sons of Harold Godwinson, as Sussex was a stronghold of the Godwin family.
Because of this the county was divided into five new baronies, called rapes, each with at least one town and a castle. This enabled the ruling group of Normans to control the manorial revenues and thus the greater part of the county's wealth. The bulk of the lords' estates lay in the wealthier coastal areas and enfeoffed knights on the inland manors. Each castle controlled a major route inland from the lords' castle near the coast. 
William, the Conqueror gave these rapes to five of his most trusted Barons: All were Normans who were close to William, with the exception of William de Braose, about whom little is known.
By 1070 William had granted four rapes, those of Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. The rape of Bramber was created after 1070 by taking land from Arundel and Lewes rapes. William de Warenne also lost the hundred of East Grinstead from the rape of Lewes to the rape of Pevensey to the east. To compensate de Warenne, William I gave him estates in Norfolk and Suffolk in what was known as the 'exchange of Lewes'. The Count of Eu also lost land as William I founded Battle Abbey, which although within the rape of Hastings, lay outside the count's jurisdiction, as the abbot of Battle answered only to the king.
William built Battle Abbey at the site of the battle of Hastings, and the exact spot where Harold fell was marked by the high altar. In 1070, Pope Alexander II ordered the Normans to do penance for killing so many people during their conquest of England. In response, William the Conqueror vowed to build an abbey where the Battle of Hastings had taken place, with the high altar of its church on the supposed spot where King Harold fell in that battle on Saturday, 14 October 1066. William I had ruled that the church of St Martin of Battle was to be exempted from all episcopal jurisdiction, putting it on the level of Canterbury.
Norman influence was already strong in Sussex before the Conquest: the abbey of Fécamp had interest in the harbours of Hastings, Rye, Winchelsea and Steyning; while the estate of Bosham was held by a Norman chaplain to Edward the Confessor. After the Norman conquest the 387 manors, that had been in Saxon hands, were replaced by just 16 heads of manors.
The 16 people, in charge of the manors, were known as the "Tenentes in capite" in other words the chief tenants who held their land directly from the crown. The list includes nine ecclesiasticals although the portion of their landholding is quite small and was virtually no different from that under Edward the Confessor. Two of the lords were Englishmen, Ode, who had been a pre-Conquest treasurer, and his brother Eldred. This means that 353 of the 387 manors in Sussex would have been wrested from their Saxon owners and given to Norman Lords by William the Conqueror
Historically the land holdings of each Saxon lord had been scattered, but now the lords lands were determined by the borders of the rape. The unit of land, known as the hide, in Sussex had eight instead of the usual four virgates,(a virgate being equal to the amount of land two oxen can plough in a season).
Reign of William II (1087–1100).
Following the death of William the Conqueror in 1087, William Rufus, the third son of William the Conqueror, took the kingship in 1088, separating it from his brother Robert Curthose, who remained Duke of Normandy. In the rebellion of 1088, the rebels, led by William the Conqueror's half-brothers Odo of Bayeux and Robert, Count of Mortain, and lord of the rape of Pevensey, with Odo the stronger of the two and the leader, decided to band together to dispose of young King William II and unite Normandy and England under a single king, the eldest Duke Robert. 
To achieve this, Rufus had to secure Sussex and Kent against a retaliatory strike by Robert, who was based in Normandy. The lord of the rape of Lewes, William de Warenne, was loyal to Rufus; Robert de Mortain, lord of the rape of Pevensey, supported the rebel, Robert; Roger de Montgomery, lord of the rape of Arundel, waited, initially supporting Robert but later switching his support to Rufus. The forces of Rufus and de Warenne surrounded Pevensey Castle in a six-week siege, starving its inhabitants and capturing the rebel leader Odo. De Warenne was mortally wounded at Pevensey, dying at Lewes on 24 June 1088 . De Mortain was pardoned and continued as lord of Pevensey.
Reign of Henry I (1100–1135).
Pevensey remained important and in 1101 Henry I spent the summer there in anticipation of attack from his brother, Robert Curthose. Curthose's attempted invasion of England was unsuccessful. Following charges against Robert de Bellême around his support for the failed invasion of Robert Curthose, Robert de Bellême fortified Arundel Castle around 1101. This led to forces of Henry I besieging Arundel Castle in 1102 for three months, building siege castles in the vicinity of Arundel probably including at Warningcamp and perhaps at Ford. Henry I's forces confiscated the castle and held it himself.
Reign of Stephen (1135–1154) including the Anarchy (1135–1153).
As the second wife of Henry I, Adeliza of Louvain was Queen of England from 1121 until Henry's death in 1135. On their marriage in 1121 Henry gave Adeliza the city of Chichester as well as Arundel Castle, where she made her home. Because of Henry I's generosity, Adeliza was given the revenues of Rutland, Shropshire and a large district of London. Adeliza gave her brother Joscelin a large estate at Petworth that was dependent on her castle of Arundel.
In 1138 Adeliza married William d'Aubigny. D'Aubigny has fought loyally for King Stephen, who made him Earl of Sussex. On 30 September 1139 Empress Matilda and her half-brother, Robert of Gloucester, landed near Arundel with a force of 140 knights, thereby beginning in earnest the civil war of the Anarchy in England. Adeliza received Matilda and Robert at her home in Arundel in defiance of the wishes of her second husband, who was a staunch supporter of King Stephen. She later betrayed them and handed them over when King Stephen besieged the castle. Trying to explain Adeliza's actions, John of Worcester suggests that "she feared the king’s majesty and worried that she might lose the great estate she held throughout England". He also mentions Adeliza's excuse to King Stephen: "She swore on oath that his enemies had not come to England on her account but that she had simply given them hospitality as persons of high dignity once close to her." Adeliza, was also a major benefactor to a leper hospitals at Arundel and in Wiltshire. While Matilda stayed at Arundel Castle, Robert marched north-west to Wallingford and Bristol, hoping to raise support for the rebellion and to link up with Miles of Gloucester, who took the opportunity to renounce his fealty to the king.
Stephen responded by promptly moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then agreed to a truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the truce are not known, but the results were that Stephen first released Matilda from the siege and then allowed her and her household of knights to be escorted to the south-west, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasoning behind Stephen's decision to release his rival remains unclear. Contemporary chroniclers suggested that Henry argued that it would be in Stephen's own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, and Stephen may have seen Robert, not the Empress, as his main opponent at this point in the conflict. Stephen also faced a military dilemma at Arundel—the castle was considered almost impregnable, and he may have been worried that he was tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen was certainly known for having a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.
In 1147, following a rebellion by Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke, King Stephen blockaded Pevensey Castle until its inhabitants were starved into submission. In 1153 William d'Aubigny helped arrange the truce between Stephen and Henry Plantagenet, known as the Treaty of Wallingford, which brought an end to The Anarchy. When the latter ascended the throne as Henry II, he confirmed William's earldom and gave him direct possession of Arundel Castle (instead of the possession in right of his wife (d.1151) he had previously had).
Angevins (1154–1216).
Reign of Henry II (1154–1189).
In 1187 fire destroyed Chichester Cathedral and much of the city of Chichester.
Isabel de Warenne (c. 1228–1282) daughter of William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, married Hugh d'Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel, son of William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel.
Reign of Richard I (1189–1199).
Richard I may have embarked in 1190 on the Third Crusade from Chichester. In 1194, while Richard the Lionheart was being held captive in France, King John's forces lay siege to Chichester Castle.
Reign of King John (1199–1216).
On 20 June 1199, after John's coronation on 6 April, the king set sail from New Shoreham to Dieppe with what Ralph of Coggeshall described as 'a mighty English host'. A truce was agreed with King Philip II of France and John visited castles and towns on Normandy's southern and eastern borders, preparing Normandy for attack from the king of France. War recommenced and by 1204 John had lost control of Normandy to Philip II.
In 1208 King John confiscated Bramber Castle from the de Braose family, after he suspected them of treachery. Having lost Normandy, and fearing a naval invasion of England from Philip II of France, John sent his fleet across the English Channel to capture and destroy Philip's ships in the estuary of the River Seine as well as to attack the ports of Dieppe and Fécamp before returning to Winchelsea, where John congratulated his captains on their success.
On 22 January 1215 while King John visited Knepp Castle for 4 days, confederated barons assembled in London to determine how best to check the career of this vicious king. In June 1216 John signed Magna Carta, however after the king's refusal to accept the terms of Magna Carta, Rye and Winchelsea opened their gates to Prince Louis of France, the son of Philip II. Forming part of the First Barons' War, this was a bid to take the crown from the hated King John. Later in 1216, Prince Louis attacked and occupied Chichester Castle. Its destruction had been ordered but the order was not carried out and the castle surrendered to Louis. In 1216, the castle, along with many others in southern England, was captured by the French. Louis continued to London where he was proclaimed king of England.
Pevensey Castle was also probably ordered to be made indefensible by King John.
Economy.
It is estimated that in the immediate aftermath of the Normans' landing at Pevensey and the Battle of Hastings, wealth in Sussex fell by 40 per cent as the Normans sought to assert control by destroying estates or capital. From Hastings to London, estates fell in value wherever the Normans marched
 Economically, Sussex suffered more than most counties; by 1086 wealth in Sussex was still 10-25 per cent lower than it had been in 1066. Of the counties where meaningful data has been recorded, the economies of only Yorkshire, Cheshire and Derbyshire which had been devastated through the harrying of the north fared worse than Sussex. By 1300 economic output in England as a whole was probably 2 to 3 times what it was in the period before the Conquest. Trade with Normandy and the rest of the Angevin Empire was increased as the Normans were familiar with their home markets. William I invited Jews to England to facilitate lending; unencumbered by rules relating to usury that pertaining to Christians. Jews mainly settled in towns with mints which included Chichester. Also the vast increase in infrastructure such as castle and church building and also the building of new towns helped the economy to grow. In the 12th century, people had more money and wanted to spend it, so more fairs were established, although belatedly many did not gain official recognition until the reign of Edward I in the late 13th century. The expansion of parishes has been described by Henry Myer-Harting as the 'economic miracle of the century' in England. In Sussex the number of parish churches approximately doubled between 1086 and 1200.
William assigned large tracts of land amongst the Norman elite, creating vast estates in some areas, particularly in Sussex and the Welsh marches.
The Normans also founded new towns in Sussex, including New Shoreham (the centre of modern Shoreham-by-Sea), Battle, Arundel, Uckfield and Winchelsea. 
Shipping records from the early 13th century show Winchelsea was Sussex's busiest port, closely followed by Shoreham. Other ports included Arundel, where William II landed from Normandy in 1097, and Seaford, where John Lackland landed on his way to being crowned King John. Before the Conquest the principle port on the Adur was Steyning. In the late 11th and early 12th centuries there was a rivalry between Steyning (owned by Fécamp Abbey) in Normandy and the ports of Bramber, New Shoreham that were owned by the de Braose family, lords of the Rape of Bramber. New Shoreham was one of most important Channel ports in 12th and 13th centuries. William de Braose established the administrative centre of the rape at Bramber where he built a bridge and brought in a toll on all ships entering the port of Steyning. De Braose was setting up a rival parish at Bramber and after Fécamp Abbey's appeal to William I, de Braose was ordered to exhume and return 13 years' worth of burials to the churchyard at Steyning, preventing the creation of a new parish at Steyning's expense. De Braose then set up the new town of New Shoreham to the south and after 1100 Fécamp Abbey focused instead on its ports of Winchelsea and Rye. Shoreham is nearest Channel port to London. Shoreham visited by King John in 1199. Exports from Shoreham included timber and hemp. Shipbuilding took place at Shoreham and included several galleys that were repaired for King John in 1210 and 1212. The earliest known charter of the Cinque Ports, included Hastings and later Rye, Winchelsea and Seaford dates from 1155.
The mint continued at Chichester throughout the period. The mint at Steyning continued until reign of William II. A new mint was established at Rye, the only one south of Yorkshire to be set up in the reigns of William II and Henry I between 1087 and 1135.
Salt-making continued to take place near the Adur estuary.
Religion.
Catholic Church.
After the East-West Schism of 1054 the medieval church formally separated into a Latin-based Catholic Church in the west of Europe and a Greek-based Orthodox Church in the east of Europe. Following the Norman Conquest of 1066, there was a purge of the English episcopate in 1070. Æthelric II, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop of Selsey was deposed and imprisoned and replaced with William the Conqueror's personal chaplain, Stigand. During Stigand's episcopate the see that had been established at Selsey was transferred to Chichester after the Council of London of 1075 decreed that sees should be centred in cities rather than vills. Bishop Ralph Luffa is credited with the foundation of the current Chichester Cathedral.
The original structure that had been built by Stigand was largely destroyed by fire in 1114.
Luffa erected a timber-framed lodge at Amberley on land held by the diocese of Chichester at Amberley since Caedwalla granted it to the see of Selsey in 683. Seffrid I and Seffrid II both replaced walls and extended the building.
The archdeaconries of Chichester and Lewes were created in the 12th century under Ralph Luffa. In 1199 Chichester Cathedral was re-consecrated under Bishop Seffrid II. 
The medieval church also set up various hospitals and schools in Sussex, including St Mary's Hospital in Chichester (c. 1290-1300); St Nicholas' Hospital in Lewes, which was run by the monks of Lewes Priory; and the Prebendal School close to Chichester Cathedral.
Monasticism.
Battle Abbey and Lewes Priory were amongst England's most important monasteries in the High Middle Ages. The Cistercian abbey at Robertsbridge was the third of Sussex's 'great monasteries'. 1094 saw the completion of the Benedictine Battle Abbey, which had been founded by a team of monks from Marmoutier Abbey on the River Loire. The abbey was built on the site of the Battle of Hastings after Pope Alexander II had ordered the Normans to do penance for killing so many people during their conquest of England. Monks also planned out the nearby town of Battle shortly after the conquest. Around 1081, the lord of Lewes Rape, William de Warenne and his wife Gundrada formed England's first and largest Cluniac monastery at Lewes Priory. The Priory of St Pancras was the first Cluniac house in England and had one of the largest monastic churches in the country. It was set within an extensive walled and gated precinct laid out in a commanding location fronting the tidal shore-line at the head of the Ouse valley to the south of Lewes. The monks at Lewes also administered monastic cells at Etoutteville as well as the abbey of Mortemer in Normandy.
At the time of the foundation of Robertsbridge Abbey, in 1176, Robertsbridge would have been in one of the wildest and most remote parts of the Weald; this would have been an important factor in the choosing of this location for the Cistercians.
Many of the monastic houses of this period were founded by Sussex's new Norman lords. As well as the foundation of Lewes Priory in 1081 by the lord of Lewes Rape, the lord of Arundel Rape, Roger de Montgomerie established Arundel Priory in 1102. Sele Priory in the Rape of Bramber was founded by the Braose family by 1126. In the Rape of Pevensey, Herluin de Conteville, step-father to William the Conqueror, established Wilmington Priory as a monastic grange, which his son, Robert, Count of Mortain presented to Grestain Abbey in Normandy.
The monastic community of Selsey Abbey, which had been the seat of Sussex's bishops from the 8th century, was moved to Chichester around 1075. Around 1123 Boxgrove Priory near Chichester was founded for Benedictine monks. In the north of the county, Woolynchmere Priory, later known as Shulbrede Priory was established as a house for Augustinian canons in the late 12th century. The premonstratensian Bayham Abbey was founded in 1208 and which became a daughter house of Prémontré Abbey in France.
Pilgrimage.
Sussex lay on part of the route of the Way of St James to the shrine of the apostle of St. James the Great on the town of Santiago de Compostela in the Crown of Castille (now Spain). Various Sussex ports, including Winchelsea, Shoreham and Lewes, were embarkation points to cross the English Channel and connect to the Way of St James via the "Via Turonensis" through the Kingdom of France.
Crusades.
Chichester and Shoreham may have been used as a point of departure for the crusades. Shoreham supplied three ships for Richard I for the Third Crusade.
Sussex had strong links with the military orders of the Knights Templar and the Knights Hospitaller. Founded in 1119, the Knights Templar established centres in Sussex including a local headquarters, or preceptory, at Shipley from around 1125, with other centres at Sompting from 1154 and at the port of Shoreham by 1170. The church at Shipley is the earliest surviving church of the Templars in England and dates from the 1130s. The Hospitallers established a centre at Poling and another at Shoreham in 1190. Various Sussex magnates went on crusade including Philip de Braose, lord of Bramber, went on crusade probably in 1128. William de Warenne III, lord of the rape of Lewes, made annual gifts from his estate at Lewes to the knights Templar and around 1146 went on crusade where he was killed in battle in 1148.
Anchorites.
In the 12th and 13th centuries Sussex had high numbers of anchorites which reduced into the 14th century.
Judaism.
Jewish people have been recorded as living in Sussex since the 12th century and are first mentioned in 1179/80 pipe roll for Chichester. A considerable Jewish community existed in Chichester by 1186. Jews are also recorded in Arundel, Hailsham, and Lewes.
Geography.
The county boundary was long and somewhat indeterminate on the north, owing to the dense forest of Andredsweald. Evidence of this is seen in Domesday Book by the survey of Worth and Lodsworth under Surrey, and also by the fact that as late as 1834 the present parishes of North and South Ambersham in Sussex were part of Hampshire.
Initial settlement by the Normans took places as the William the Conqueror built castles in which he placed his most trusted men, who persuaded other knights to garrison and guard the castles. In common with some other areas of eastern England like Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Essex and Kent, Sussex received some of the most migrants from what is now France after the Norman conquest.
Sussex's population in 1086 has been estimated at about 66,000, doubling to 123,000 by 1290. In the High Middle Ages, the Sussex coast was one of the most densely populated parts of England. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 coastal Sussex and parts of Suffolk and Norfolk were the only parts of England to record a population density of 20 people per square mile, twice the average for England. Coastal Sussex remained amongst the most densely populated areas of England through the 12th century. Other populous areas of England at this time included eastern East Anglia, parts of Kent and a series of districts between Somerset and the Humber Estuary in Yorkshire.
Governance.
William the Conqueror set out compact lordships across Sussex in what were termed 'rapes'. Shortly after 1066 there were four rapes: Arundel, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings. By the time of the Domesday Book, William the Conqueror had created the rape of Bramber out of parts of the Arundel and Lewes rapes, so that the Adur estuary could be better defended. 
The rape of Arundel was much larger than its present size as included what was to become the rape of Chichester, which did not become separate until the mid 13th century.
Although the origin and original purpose of the Rapes is not known, their function after 1066 is clear. With its own lord and sheriff, each Rape was an administrative and fiscal unit.
Each rape has its own court held by the lord of the rape and their knights. For instance the court of the rape of Hastings would hear all cases to life and limb within the rape, meeting every three weeks to report on all things which happen within the barony. From 1198 the common gaol for Sussex was at Chichester Castle. In what was the only directly provable example of Continental innovation in English local government in the reign of Stephen, Queen Adeliza established her brother Joscelin from Brabant at Petworth and adopted the Brabazon method of local government at Arundel giving power to the castellans (such as those at Brussels and Louvain.
By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 Sussex probably had seven boroughs - certainly Chichester, Arundel, Steyning, Lewes and Pevensey, and probably Hastings and Rye. Seaford also probably had borough status by 1140, and certainly by 1235. New Shoreham probably had borough-like status in 1208 and had borough status by 1235.
As with other parts of England, the tenants-in-chief of Sussex would have attended the "curia regis", the successor to the "Witenagemot" of the Anglo Saxon period and the precursor to the English parliament. Attendees at the "magnum concilium" from Sussex would have included the lords of the rapes as well as the abbot of Battle.
Culture.
Architecture.
In terms of architecture, the impact of the Norman conquest has been described as "dramatic, far-reaching and visible". Some of the enormous Romanesque buildings of Sussex and the rest of southern England, such as Chichester Cathedral, Battle Abbey, Lewes Priory and the church at New Shoreham were amongst the largest and most daring in Europe that led directly to Gothic architecture Important Norman architecture in Sussex includes Chichester Cathedral, the ruins of Lewes Priory and Battle Abbey as well as Norman remains in the castles at Arundel, Bramber, Lewes, Pevensey and Hastings.
Norman castles typically consisted of a tower keep and a hall keep. The keep at Pevensey Castle is nationally significant and is entirely different from most castles as enormous buttresses were built which extended beyond the walls and were over thick. Lewes Castle is, with Lincoln Castle, one of only two castles in England with two mottes.
Completed in the early 12th century, the designs of Battle Abbey for the rounded apse, ambulatory and radiating chapels were taken from Rouen Cathedral and were repeated at Canterbury Cathedral in the 1070s and Worcester Cathedral in the 1080s. Battle Abbey also took the basic elements of its building from Rouen Cathedral and the Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen. At long and with an internal vault height of at the altar and at the crossing, Lewes Priory was the largest church in Sussex, being longer than Chichester Cathedral including its Lady Chapel, and is comparable in scale to the original form of Ely Cathedral or the surviving form of Lichfield Cathedral.
Most churches in this era were built to simple designs, consisting of a nave and a chancel; others included a central tower or transepts and sometimes a western tower and aisle. Important churches in Sussex with features from the Saxo-Norman overlap include Sompting, Clayton and Bosham. By the 12th century, churches in Sussex were built less exaggeratedly tall in proportion and with more ornamental designs in the transitional style, as architecture moved from Norman towards Gothic. Notable minster or parish churches from the late Norman period include the churches at New Shoreham (c 1120-1150) and Rye. Around 1160 ornamental styles became more common, with zigzags around windows as at Climping or around doors at Arundel, chevrons at Burpham and diamonds at Broadwater. In the late 12th century the Knights Templar remodelled Sompting church, producing an 'exquisitely detailed' apse in the south transept in what Ian Nairn referred to as a completely different 'latest Norman' style similar to a style then current in Gascony. 
As well as Battle Abbey, other Sussex churches make use of the designs of churches in Normandy. The churches of Old Shoreham and Boxgrove Priory have similar architecture to Lessay Abbey. Uncommon in England except for in Sussex and Kent, which were relatively close to Normandy, many Sussex churches were built with apses. Examples include churches at Newhaven, Keymer, North Marden and Upwaltham. Three examples of rounded west church towers of the type most commonly found in East Anglia exist around the lower Ouse valley at Piddinghoe, Southease and St Michael's at Lewes.
Many prestigious Sussex buildings in the High Middle Ages used Caen stone from Normandy which was imported into Sussex's ports and river estuaries, even reaching places such as Shulbrede Priory in the Weald on the Sussex-Surrey border, which were away from waterways. Ships carried loads of up to 40 tonnes of Caen stone at a time across the English Channel from Normandy. One of the most widely used building stones to be imported, Caen stone was typically used in squared blocks or used in ornate decorative column or arch work. Buildings using Caen stone include Chichester Cathedral, Lewes Priory, Battle Abbey and the churches of Steyning, Kingston Buci and Buncton.
Art.
With its own masons' yard, Lewes Priory manufactured decorated glazed floor tiles and had a school of sacred painting that worked throughout Sussex. The calibre of surviving figurative carvings that are displayed at the British Museum is of a highly sophisticated order. Dating from around the 12th century, the 'Lewes Group' of wall paintings can be found in several churches across the centre of Sussex, including at Clayton, Coombes, Hardham, Plumpton and now-lost paintings at Westmeston. Some of the paintings are celebrated for their age, extent and quality: Ian Nairn calls those at Hardham "the fame of Hardham", and descriptions such as "fine", "Hardham's particular glory" and "one of the most important sets in the country" have been applied.
Language.
At the start of the High Middle Ages Sussex had its own dialect of Old English which was in effect part of a continuum of southern English dialect from Kent in the east to Wessex in the west. As the influence of the Norman language increased, the Anglo-Norman language developed and the Sussex dialect of Old English evolved into a dialect of Middle English.
Literature.
"The Proverbs of Alfred" is a collection of sayings supposedly from King Alfred said to have been uttered at Seaford that were written in the mid-12th century in Middle English. It is likely to have been written by someone living in or originating from southern Sussex, probably from either Lewes Priory or Battle Abbey.

Jennie Wåhlin

Jennie Frances Wåhlin (born November 26, 1997) is a Swedish curler from Stockholm. She currently plays second on Team Isabella Wranå. She won a gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics as alternate for the Anna Hasselborg team.
In 2018 she was inducted into the Swedish Curling Hall of Fame.
Career.
Wåhlin played in the World Junior Curling Championships in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 as a member of Team Isabella Wranå. In 2014, her team of Wranå, Elin Lövstrand, Almida de Val and Fanny Sjöberg had a fourth-place finish, after they lost in the bronze medal game to Russia. In 2015, she and teammates Wranå, Wåhlin, Johanna Heldin and Johanna Höglund again finished fourth after this time losing to Switzerland in the bronze medal game. She was back at the event in 2017 where her team won the gold medal, defeating Scotland's Sophie Jackson in the final, and lost just two round robin games in the process. The next year the same team went undefeated in the round robin, but ended up losing to Canada's Kaitlyn Jones in the final. This team also represented Sweden at the 2017 Winter Universiade, where they took home the bronze medal. Wåhlin represented Sweden one more time at the juniors in 2019 as second for Tova Sundberg. They placed sixth.
As World Junior champions, the Wranå rink qualified for the 2017 Humpty's Champions Cup, Wåhlin's first Grand Slam event. The team did not qualify for the playoffs but did win one game. The team won their first World Curling Tour event at the 2018 AMJ Campbell Shorty Jenkins Classic. A month later, they won the Paf Masters Tour. Over the course of the 2018–19 season, the team played in four slams, failing to qualify in any of the four. They won one game at the 2018 Tour Challenge, one game at the 2018 National, no games at the 2019 Canadian Open and one game at the 2019 Champions Cup. Also during this season, the team won the 2019 Winter Universiade.
Team Wranå had a successful 2019–20 season, winning two tour events (the Royal LePage Women's Fall Classic and the Paf Masters Tour once again) and finishing second at the Women's Masters Basel and the Glynhill Ladies International. They played in two slam events, winning one game at both the 2019 Tour Challenge and the 2019 National.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Team Wranå only played in one tour event during the abbreviated 2020–21 season. The team competed at the 2020 Women's Masters Basel, where they missed the playoffs with a 1–2 record. In December, they played Team Hasselborg in the Sweden National Challenge, where they won by a score of 17–12. The Swedish Women's Curling Championship was cancelled due to the pandemic, so Team Hasselborg was named as the Swedish Team for the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship. After the season, longtime lead Fanny Sjöberg stepped back from competitive curling and Maria Larsson joined the team as their new lead.
Aside from Team Wranå, Wåhlin has also been the alternate for the Anna Hasselborg rink. She has been to two world championships with them, winning a silver medal in 2018 and won an Olympic gold medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics. Wåhlin didn't play any games however.

<doc id="56675418" url="?curid=56675418" title="Pulicchio di Gravina">
Pulicchio di Gravina

Pulicchio di Gravina (in the local dialect "Pulícchie" or "Pulidde") is the second-largest doline in the Murge plateau (in Apulia, southern Italy) after Pulo di Altamura. It falls into the territory of Gravina in Puglia, being located about north of the latter, close to the border with Altamura's territory. It shares the local toponym "pulo" with other large dolines of the region, i.e. Pulo di Altamura, Pulo di Molfetta and Pulicchio di Toritto.
The doline is very close to other two karst landforms, Gurio Lamanna and Tre Paduli.
Dimensions.
The doline is shaped like an egg and it is highly regular, with the slope almost constant on all its sides (as shown on the map's level curves). The biggest length (in direction NNW-SE) is equal to . The doline is somewhat wider in the northern part () than in the southern part (). Its perimeter is approximately , while the maximum depth is . The lowest point has height from the sea level. Therefore, the doline turns out to be smaller but a little deeper than Pulo di Altamura.
Etymology.
The etymology of toponym "pulo" is currently unknown. It is used only in the Murge plateau to denote a doline, while it is unused in other regions of Apulia. The term is also used for the nearby dolines Pulo di Altamura, Pulo di Molfetta, and Pulicchio di Toritto ("pulicchio" means small "pulo"), and it is attested as early as in the 17th century, since Domenico Santoro in 1688, referring to Pulo di Altamura, wrote "luogo detto dalli Cittadini lo Pulo" (place called by Altamura people 'Pulo').
History of scientific research on Pulo di Altamura.
Te first thorough scientific study on Pulicchio di Gravina (until then completely unknown among geologists and naturalists) dates back to Carmelo Colamonico (1917).
Previously, a few other scientists and geologists had only cited a natural cavity near Altamura. For instance, F. Virgilio (1900) briefly mentions the doline calling it "pulicchio" and incorrectly traces its origin to an unspecified "underground water erosion". According to Virgilio, the absence of rock masses at the bottom of the doline proves that subsidence occurred due to "underground water erosion".
Carmelo Colamonico refutes F. Virgilio's theory pointing out that the absence of rock masses at the bottom of the doline proves, instead, that the origin is due to "superficial erosion".
Origin and evolution.
In the same way as Pulo di Altamura and Gurio Lamanna, the origin of Pulicchio di Gravina can be explained through karst processes, i.e. the physical (erosion) and chemical (dissolution) action of rainwater, that the fractured limestone rock of the Murge plateau underwent over the millennia (and it still continues).
Unlike other karst dolines of the region (such as Pulo di Altamura), Pulicchio di Gravina is the endpoint of a very small drainage basin and therefore the amount of rainwater collected inside the doline is very little. Carmelo Colamonico points out that not even the rainwater falling on the area close to the doline manages to reach it (at least not superficially). The scarce rainwater is absorbed very quickly. Some farmers of that region stated that "there is never water at the bottom of Pulicchio di Gravina". Furthermore, no noteworthy sinkholes have been discovered inside the doline.
Carmelo Colamonico argues that Pulicchio di Gravina originated mainly due to superficial erosion (and, partly, also the chemical dissolution of the limestone). Nevertheless, just the superficial erosion would not explain both its large size and the proximity to other two dolines, Gurio Lamanna and Tre Paduli. It cannot be excluded the drainage basin of Pulicchio di Gravina may have been larger than today's and it may have been reduced due to the formation of the other two nearby dolines. Nevertheless, the absence of lamas near Pulicchio di Gravina does not seem to confirm this hypothesis. The lama (or lamas) may have been eroded due to the formation of the nearby Gurio Lamanna and Tre Paduli.
Another hypothesis is that it might be a "collapse doline", i.e. a doline generated due to the collapse of the ceiling of a pre-existing cave. Even if it is assumed that the origin of the doline was caused by the collapse of a cave, the initial size of it would have been so small that in any case it is necessary to introduce karst action (rainwater) in order to explain the origin of the doline.
Afforestation.
As shown on the photo published by Carmelo Colamonico (1917), Pulicchio di Gravina originally did not have any trees inside. In the 1950s, a forest has been established.

Plot.
Superman has become a popular superhero in Metropolis and the world. After foiling an attempted abduction of the mayor by Intergang, he takes a piece of their technology to S.T.A.R. Labs for analysis. Following this, Superman is interviewed by "Daily Planet" reporter Lois Lane about his family heritage and the origins of how he came to Earth. Later that night, Lois meets Clark Kent’s (Superman’s human identity which Lois doesn't know) adoptive parents. Because of her little knowledge about Clark’s personal life, Lois leaves upset and leaving her reconsidering their relationship. 
At S.T.A.R. Labs, Dr. Silas Stone and Dr. John Irons examine the technology from the Intergang attack and confirm it to be of Apokoliptian and Earth origin, leaving Superman to suspect that his archenemy Lex Luthor was involved in supplying Intergang. Luthor, who is currently in government arrest, however, refuses his involvement, but Superman remains suspicious. Meanwhile in space, astronauts Hank Henshaw, his wife Terri, and their crew are suddenly impacted by a meteorite that portaled out of nowhere. The meteor damages their ship, killing Terri and the crew, leaving Hank’s fate unknown. Upon crash landing in the ocean, Lex Luthor sends a submarine crew to investigate while the Atlanteans do the same. Without warning, the Atlanteans and the sub crew are attacked and killed by a large being in a containment suit, who tears across the country on a rampage.
At a restaurant owned by Superman fan Bibbo Bibbowski, Clark confesses to Lois that he is Superman and that he loves her. Meanwhile, the unknown being heads toward Metropolis, attacking everything and everyone it sees until the Justice League arrives to confront it. The being leaves several members of the League injured and nearly kills Wonder Woman in a struggle until Superman arrives to confront it. The being emerges from its suit and is revealed to be a gray-skinned, white-haired monster with incredible strength, stamina, and invulnerability. The creature, dubbed "Doomsday" by Lois, attacks Superman, who grapples with it. Superman and Doomsday engage in a fierce battle across Metropolis which eventually leaves Superman wounded and exhausted with pain. When the monster sees Lois and prepares to kill her, Superman flies toward it at full speed and deals a blow that snaps Doomsday's neck, ending the monster's violent rampage. Superman is victorious, but is stabbed in the chest and dies in Lois' arms while Jimmy Olsen records the heartbreaking scene.
In the aftermath, a state funeral is held for Superman and the Kents welcome Lois into their family. Sometime later, Jimmy brings Lois back to Superman’s memorial where his coffin is empty as the world watches a figure resembling Superman fly away.
In a series of mid-and post-credits scenes, a clone of Superman survives numerous failed experiments from LexCorp, Dr. Irons is seen forging his own Superman suit from steel, Superman’s rocket buries itself in the North Pole resulting in the creation of the Fortress of Solitude and a Superman-like cyborg is seen flying in space, heading towards Earth, ending with Superman’s "S" shield melting.
Voice cast.
Mera, Alfred Pennyworth, Damian Wayne, Hawkman, Kate Kane and others appear in non-speaking cameos during Superman's funeral.
Production.
"The Death of Superman" is the 32nd installment in the DC Universe Animated Original Movies line, the 11th film in the DC Animated Movie Universe, and is based on the 1992—1993 DC comic book storyline of the same name. The story had previously been adapted in the 2007 film "". However, "Superman: Doomsday" greatly altered and condensed the story to fit it within a 75-minute runtime, including the events associated with the return of Superman and that sequel-based comic. "The Death of Superman" was written to be much more faithful to the original story; according to DC's Tim Beedle, the film is "much less condensed and will include many of the fan-favorite moments from the story that were left out of "Doomsday"." The film is co-directed by Jake Castorena and produced by Warner Bros. Animation and DC Films. According to supervising producer James Tucker, a primary theme of the film is relationships and their impact on Superman's world.
Release.
"The Death of Superman" had its premiere at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2018 and released in direct-to-video on August 7, 2018, distributed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment on DVD, Blu-ray, and on digital distribution platforms on July 24, 2018. The film was also released in a limited theatrical release alongside Reign of the Supermen on January 13, 2019. The movie has been re-released on home video, edited together with its sequel, on October 1, 2019 as "The Death and Return of Superman"
Reception.
Reviews for "The Death of Superman" have been positive. On Rotten Tomatoes 92% of the critics liked the movie with an average rating of 7.4/10 based on 13 reviews. "Newsarama" called the film "One of DC's Best Animated Films in Past 5 Years", praising the epic and emotional punch the film accomplishes in all three acts. i09 gave another positive review, praising Superman's character arc, his relationship with Lois, and the story at large because the DC Universe Movies adaptations currently "graft pre-Crisis storylines onto a new continuity, which affords different angles, strengths, and weaknesses... Because the backdrop for this version of "Death of Superman" is different, new choices get made to communicate a sense of threat." It was because of that, that ""The Death of Superman" film adaptation justifies its existence." IGN put out their own mixed review, pointing out that ""The Death of Superman" marks the third time in 11 years that a movie has killed off the Man of Steel... making this latest DC animated offering a tedious case of been there-done that. While this new version hews more closely to its bestselling 1992–1993 namesake comics event than either 2007’s ' or 2016’s ' did, it nevertheless lacks anything truly fresh or revelatory to add to this now well-worn tale."
"The Death of Superman" peaked at #1 on the Top Ten Blu-ray Sellers for Week and the Top Five Home Media Sellers for Week, scoring a very strong Blu-ray market share of 78%. The film earned $1,073,153 from domestic DVD sales and $5,445,671 from domestic Blu-ray sales, bringing its total domestic home video earnings to $6,518,824.
Accolades.
"The Death of Superman" won the Home Media Award for Best Superhero Disc, beating out " 40th Anniversary 4K Blu-ray", "", " – Limited Edition Blu-ray", and "Incredibles 2".
Comic book tie-in.
In August 2018, DC announced a 12-part digital comic series titled "The Death of Superman: Part 1", by veteran Superman writer Louise Simonson. In the US, retailer Best Buy offered an exclusive "Deluxe Edition" Blu-Ray containing a hardcover graphic novel titled "The Death of Superman: The Wake." The Best Buy graphic novel includes the last four chapters of Simonson's digital comic series.
Sequel.
A sequel titled "Reign of the Supermen", was released on DVD and Blu-Ray on January 15, 2019. It is based on the second part of the storyline. The cast includes Cameron Monaghan as Kon-El / Conner Kent / Superboy and Charles Halford as Eradicator.

Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker

Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker ("Christian Augustinus Industries") is a former Danish tobacco company which now serves as the investment company of the Augustinus Foundation.
History.
The company was founded by Ole Augustinus on 11 May 1750 when he established a tobacco factory on Frederiksborggade. A new building at Vestergade 8 was inaugurated in the 1770s. Augustinus three sons were all active in the venture. The eldest of them, Christian Augustinus, from whom it later took its name, took over the operations after their father's death in 1779. The building in Vestergade was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795 but the current building at the site was completed a few years later.
A new tobacco factory on Gammel Kongevej in Frederiksberg was inaugurated in 1870.
The company established a tobacco factory at Gullandsgade on Amager in 1914. The company later changed its name to Chr. Augustinus after it had been taken over by Ole Augustinus' son Christian Augustinus.
In 1919, Christian Augustinus established De Danske Cigar- &amp; Tobaksfabrikker ("The Danish Cigar and Tobacco Factories") in a partnership with E. Nobel and A/S Horwitz &amp; Kattentid but the company was changed to Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker after A/S Horwitz &amp; Kattentid was bought out in 1933 and E. Nobel was bought out in 1938 although A/S De Danske Cigar- &amp; Tobaksfabrikker was kept as a secondary name. The company acquired A/S Horwitz &amp; Kattentid in 1949.
The Augustinus Foundation was established in 1942 at the initiative of Ludvig Augustinus. In 1861 Chr. Augustinus Fabrikker merged its tobacco-related activities with those of C.W. Obel and R. Færchs Fabrikker under the name Skandinavisk Tobakskompagni.
Headquarters.
The company is headquartered at Sankt Annæ Plads 13 in central Copenhagen.

Keysoe (horse)

Keysoe (1916 – after 1929) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. Bred and owned by the 17th Earl of Derby she was the product of a mating between two St Leger winners and won the race herself in 1919. She was unraced as a juvenile but developed into a top-class stayer at three, winning the Gratwicke Stakes and the Nassau Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse before taking the St Leger and later winning the Newmarket Oaks. She failed to win as a four-year-old in 1920 although she was placed in all of her races. After her retirement from racing, she had considerable success as a broodmare despite producing very few foals.
Background.
Keysoe was a brown mare reportedly standing 17 hands high bred in England by her owner Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby. During her racing career she was trained by George Lambton at the Stanley House stable near Newmarket, Suffolk.
Her sire Swynford was an outstanding racehorse who won the St Leger in 1910 and the Eclipse Stakes in the following year. He was even better as a breeding stallion with his other offspring including Blandford, Saucy Sue, Challenger, Tranquil and Sansovino. Keysoe's dam Keystone II was an exceptional racemare who won the Epsom Oaks in 1906.
Racing career.
1919: three-year-old season.
Keysoe was unraced as a two-year-old and began her racing career in the spring of 1919. In May 1919, she ran in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket but finished unplaced behind Roseway. Her performance came as a disappointment to her connections who had regarded her as superior to her stablemate Glaciale, who finished third. In June she finished unplaced behind Flying Spear in the Coronation Stakes at Royal Ascot. At Goodwood Racecourse on 29 July she recorded her first success as she won the Gratwicke Stakes "in a canter" by eight lengths from Britannia and Misty Morning. At the same track in August she followed up by winning the ten furlong Nassau Stakes winning at odds of 13/8. She then contracted a respiratory infection and started "coughing" which disrupted her training.
On 10 September Keysoe was moved up in class to contest 144th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs in at Doncaster Racecourse. Wartime restrictions meant that the race had been run at Newmarket since 1914 and the return of the race to its traditional venue attracted an enormous crowd with spectators packed hundreds deep along the half-mile straight. The crowd included the 85-year-old ex-jockey John Osborne who won the race on Lord Clifden and Apology and was attending his 66th St Leger. Ridden by the Australian jockey Bernard "Brownie" Carslake Keysoe started at odds of 100/8 (12.5/1) against nine opponents including Buchan who had finished runner-up in both the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby and started 8/11 favourite ahead of the Prince of Wales's Stakes winner Dominion and the Irish challenger Cheap Popularity. In a slowly-run race, Keysoe led for most of the way and then "shot ahead" in the straight to win "very easily indeed" by six lengths from Dominion with Buchan two lengths back in third.
Three weeks after her Leger Triumph Keysoe started 4/6 favourite for the Kingsclere Stakes at Newbury Racecourse but was defeated at level weights by the Park Hill Stakes winner Flying Spear. Later that month she returned to winning form, taking the Newmarket Oaks over fourteen furlongs when conceding fourteen pounds to the runner-up Palatina. On her final appearance of the season she was beaten by Pomme de Terre in the Liverpool St Leger on 5 November.
1920: four-year-old season.
Keysoe remained in training as a four-year-old in 1920. In May she finished second to Kentish Cob in the Burwell Stakes at Newmarket and was then beaten by the colt Our Stephen (her only opponent) in the Great Northern Handicap at York. In the Ascot Gold Cup in June she came home fourth behind Buchan, Tangiers and Juveigneur, but was promoted to third after Buchan was disqualified for crossing the runner-up. In August Keysoe finished third behind Iron hand and Manilardo in the Ebor Handicap at York.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Keysoe as an "inferior" winner of the St Leger.
Breeding record.
At the end of her racing career Keysoe was retired to become a broodmare for Lord Derby's stud. She produced few foals but at least two top-class performers. Her progeny included:

Magda Gál

Magda Gál (married name Házi) (1907-1990), was a female Hungarian international table tennis player.
Table tennis career.
She was a prolific World Table Tennis Championships medal winner and secured eight silver medals and twelve bronze medals from the 1929 World Table Tennis Championships to the 1936 World Table Tennis Championships.
Gál came short of a gold medal for two reasons; first the fact that with various doubles partners she was unable to overcome the six times world champion pairing of Mária Mednyánszky and Anna Sipos, and secondly the war effectively ended her chances to compete at world level. She did however continue to play in the United States. She also won two English Open titles.
Personal life.
Gál was born into a banking family was the only woman competitor on the table tennis team at the University of Szeged.
She married her fellow international player Tibor Házi in 1937 and in 1939 they fled to the United States because of their Jewish origins and they settled in Bethesda, Maryland. She died in 1990 aged 83 and Házi died in 1999.

Hotel LaBonte

Hotel LaBonte is a historic hotel in Douglas, Wyoming, United States. Built in 1913–14, it was part of the town's early 20th century building boom, the result of new railroad and road connections. Local investors engaged the Baerresen Brothers of Cheyenne and Denver as architects, and contractor Edward Reavill erected the three story brick structure. It had electrical lighting, steam heat and telephones in 54 guest rooms. The U-shaped hotel is on a corner lot at the intersection of North Second and Walnut Streets in downtown Douglas. Projecting wings facing Walnut Street flank a recessed courtyard that accommodates the hotel's entrance. The dining room occupies the ground floor of the east wing, and two storefronts occupy the west wing on the corner. The lobby has a tiled floor, a beamed ceiling and decorative columns. Windows were replaced during renovations in 1967 and after a 1981 fire.
The hotel's name was chosen for its association with bountifulness, and in honor of the reputed first resident of Converse County, Pierre LaBonte. Hotel LaBonte was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 10, 2008. The hotel was renovated for a third time in 2015. It remains in operation as a hotel.

Joseph Godwin Greenfield

Joseph Godwin Greenfield, (24 May 1884 – 2 March 1958) was an early neuropathologist. He created, with 28 founding members, the neuropathological club, which would eventually become the British Neuropathological Society. Greenfield served as pathologist at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square.
Early life.
Godwin Greenfield was born in Edinburgh, Scotland to William S. Greenfield, who was chair of pathology and clinical medicine at the University of Edinburgh. Godwin Greenfield began his early education at the Edinburgh Academy before becoming a boarder at the Merchiston Castle School.
Career.
Greenfield served as house physician under Alexander Bruce and helped arrange lectures for Byrom Bramwell during his first year of residency at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. He later served as house physician at East London Hospital for Children and at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery at Queen Square, London. Greenfield then became assistant pathologist to Matthew Stewart at the General Infirmary at Leeds in 1912, but returned to Queen's Square two years later where he became the chair of pathology, a post he held until his retirement in 1949.
During his first few years as pathologist, he also volunteered for a commission from the Royal Army Medical Corps and was deployed in France during World War I, notably serving during the Great Retreat from Mons. In 1917 he was appointed to a RAMC center in Tooting for treatment of nervous system injuries, and returned to his post at Queen's Square at the end of his commission in 1919.
Following the outbreak of World War II 1939, the National Hospital at Queen's Square was evacuated, and Greenfield relocated to Chase Farm Hospital in Enfield Town where he organized pathological services. He returned to London in 1945.
During his career, Greenfield made several significant contributions to the field of neuropathology and received several honors. In 1917, Greenfield took membership in the Royal College of Physicians, earned his MD with a gold medal from the University of Edinburgh in 1921, and was elected a fellow of the college in 1925. During his time at the National Hospital, Greenfield collaborated with Farquhar Buzzard on several publications, including research on von Economo’s encephalitis in 1919 and "Pathology of the Nervous System" in 1921. Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy is occasionally known by the eponym Greenfield's disease because of his work studying its pathophysiology and histology.
Greenfield played an important role in defining neuropathology as a distinct discipline, including lecturing to the Royal College of physicians on 'the pathology of the neuron' in 1939. In 1950, Greenfield and 28 of his colleagues started a 'neuropathological club' to organize discussion of difficult cases and help unify clinical and experimental aspects of the field. This club eventually became the British Neuropathological Society. He organized and lectured at the First International Congress of Neuropathologists in 1952 and presided the Second International Congress of Neuropathologists in 1955.
Godwin Greenfield retired from the National Hospital staff in 1949, but continued research and lecturing and frequently visited the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and Blindness in Bethesda, Maryland. Greenfield died of a heart attack in 1958 following a farewell dinner in Bethesda. His text, "Greenfield's Neuropathology", was published posthumously later that year and became an important reference in the field and continues to be developed as a standard reference.

Emma Sproson

Emma Sproson (13 April 1867 – 22 December 1936), was a suffragette, then a suffragist, socialist, politician and women's rights activist. Active in the Midlands and from a working class background, she became Wolverhampton's first female councillor, gaining the nickname "Red Emma" in the process.
Early life.
Sproson was born Emily Lloyd on 13 April 1867 in West Bromwich, Staffordshire (now in the West Midlands), England. She was one of seven children of Ann, "" Johnson, and her husband, John, a builder of canal boats; he was a heavy drinker, and the family lived in extreme poverty. In the mid-1870s the family moved to Wolverhampton and, at around the same time, Emma began to work part-time, running errands or picking coal off the local tips and slag heaps.
In around 1876, at the age of nine, she left home and went into domestic service, although she was able to attend school four days a week. When she was thirteen she obtained a position working in a shop, although she was dismissed after accusing the owner's brother of making sexual advances towards her. Unemployed, she moved to Lancashire to find work; she taught at a Sunday school and joined a church debating society.
Political awakening and activism.
The historian Jane Martin, in Sproson's entry in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" describes Sproson's attendance at a public political meeting as "the defining moment in her conversion to women's suffrage". At the meeting Sproson asked Lord Curzon a question; he refused on the basis that "she was a woman and did not have the vote".
Sproson returned to Wolverhampton by 1895 with enough money to set up a business—most likely a shop in the front room of the house she began sharing with her mother. She became a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP) around this time and, in August 1896, she married Frank Sproson, a postman and the secretary of the Wolverhampton branch of the ILP; he was also supportive of the movement for women's suffrage. The couple had four children, although only three survived: Frank, born in 1899; Chloris, born in 1897; and George, born in 1906.
In October 1906 Frank Sproson invited Emmeline Pankhurst of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to speak at an ILP meeting. Emma acted as the Chair for the meeting and Pankhurst stayed overnight at the couple's house. Emma joined the WSPU shortly afterwards, and began a letter-writing campaign to local newspapers.
In early-1907 Sproson attended suffrage meetings in London and, on 13 February, she attended a WSPU meeting at Caxton Hall, followed by a march to parliament. The marchers tried to force their way into the Palace of Westminster; police intervened and Sproson and others were arrested. Given a choice between a fine or a two-week prison sentence, she chose incarceration. The following month she was arrested, again on a march from Caxton Hall to parliament. She was sent to Holloway Prison for a month, where she was visited by Christabel Pankhurst, the co-founder of the WSPU.
On her release Sproson attended and spoke at a lunch hosted to celebrate the release of all those imprisoned. She returned to Wolverhampton, where she and fellow WSPU member Jennie Baines spoke at a public meeting before she went on a WSPU speaking tour of the Black Country.
In late-1907 or early-1908 Sproson, growing increasingly unhappy with the authoritarian manner in which the Pankhursts ran the WSPU, left the organisation and joined the Women's Freedom League (WFL), a non-violent suffrage group. She became branch secretary in Wolverhampton and a member of the National Executive by February 1908.
Sproson was also a member of the Women's Tax Resistance League, who refused to pay tax in protest against disenfranchisement; tax resistance was also a policy of the WFL. In April 1910, Sproson spoke with Amy Sanderson and Muriel Matters at a WFL mass gathering in Trafalgar Square. In May 1911 she was sent to prison for seven days for refusing to pay for a dog licence. She went on hunger strike and was reclassified as a political prisoner. Her dog was shot by the police.
In November 1911 Sproson joined the WFL leader Charlotte Despard and three other WFL members as a delegation to meet H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister. By April 1912 Sproson had become disenchanted with Despard's autocratic control over the WFL, and she left the organisation. She took no further part in national campaigning, but concentrated instead on local politics.
Local politics.
In 1919 and 1920 Sproson stood in local elections for the Labour Party in the Wolverhampton Park ward, but was unelected. In 1921 she stood in the Dunstall ward, where she was successful; in doing so, she became Wolverhampton's first female councillor. To mark her victory she waved a red flag from the balcony of Wolverhampton town hall, which earned her the nickname "Red Emma". She served on committees dealing with health—particularly mental health—and housing for single mothers. In late 1922 she exposed financial corruption at the local fever hospital, although the subsequent investigation rejected the allegations; she was censured by the Labour Party as a result.
Sproson successfully defended herself at the local by-election in 1924, but left the Labour Party before the next election in 1927; she stood as an independent candidate but lost. It marked the end of her activity in political life.
Sproson's hearing declined in her later years, and she died at home on 22 December 1936. Jane Martin concludes that "Sproson's working-class, midlands-based career provides a vivid counterbalance to the view of the women's suffrage movement which portrays it as predominantly bourgeois and London-centred".

Muchdi Purwopranjono

Muchdi Purwopranjono (born 15 April 1949) is an Indonesian politician and former major general who served briefly as chief of the Indonesian Army's Special Forces (Kopassus) and was former deputy head of the State Intelligence Agency (BIN). He was relieved of command duties in 1998 after the fall of Soeharto and was subsequently deemed responsible for abductions of pro-democracy activists. In 2008, he was acquitted of commissioning and assisting in the 2004 assassination of human rights campaigner Munir, following a trial deemed flawed by human rights organizations. He is presently the leader of a breakaway faction of Tommy Soeharto’s Berkarya Party and his leadership is recognized by the government.
Early life.
Muchdi was born on 15 April 1949 in Sleman, Yogyakarta. He is the sixth of nine siblings. 
He has said his father was a leader of Masyumi, an Islamic party, and his mother's family belonged to the Nahdlatul Ulama Muslim mass organization. As a teenager, Muchdi was involved in the Indonesian Muslim Students (PII). Later, he served as deputy chairman of the Family of Indonesian Muslim Students (KBPII), an organization that considers communism and LGBT among the greatest threats to Indonesia.
Muchdi has expressed pride in having been a member of "Generation 66", the generation that helped to bring down founding president Sukarno and replace him with Suharto. Muchdi said he was involved in the Indonesian Student Youth Action Front (KAPPI) in Yogyakarta and often took part in demonstrations.
Military career.
After completing high school, Muchdi entered the Military Academy in 1967 and graduated in 1970. He served in East Timor four times. Muchdi became close to fellow soldier Prabowo Subianto, as both were tough fighters and Muslims. Muchdi's later promotions in the military were attributed to his connection to Prabowo, who in 1983 had married then-president Suharto's daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi. Starting in 1995, Muchdi was promoted three times in three years from colonel to brigadier general to major general.
Muchdi has said that in 1986, while he was training at the Army Staff and Command College (Seskoad) in Bandung, he was summoned by the Intelligence Task Force of the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib) in Jakarta and detained for three days on accusations of having been a member of the "Pemuda Rakyat" (People's Youth) division of the Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) prior to his entry to AKABRI (the Indonesian Armed Forces Academy). He countered that his parents and family had actually been targets of the PKI in Yogyakarta 1965.
Muchdi served in territorial command posts in Irian Jaya (now Papua) from the late 1980s to mid-1990s, Jambi (1995-96), East Java (1996-97) and Kalimantan (1997-98). In 1998, he was Kopassus commander for three months. In May 1998 he was removed from structural duties following the resignation of Suharto. In August 1998 an Indonesian Military (TNI) Officers' Honorary Council ("Dewan Kehormatan Perwira") ruled Muchdi was among those responsible for the 1997-98 kidnappings of pro-democracy activists. After that, Muchdi was a general without a command portfolio at TNI headquarters. 
Promotion to Kopassus chief.
Muchdi's promotion to the leadership of Kopassus on 28 March 1998 came at the behest of his friend and predecessor Prabowo, who was being promoted to chief of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command (Kostrad). Then-Army chief Wiranto opposed Muchdi being installed as Kopassus chief and instead favored Brigadier General Sang Nyoman Suwisma, a Hindu. But Wiranto was outmaneuvered by Prabowo, who was close to Suharto. As Wiranto recounted in his memoir "Witness in the Storm":
Muchdi spent fewer than 60 days as Kopassus chief amid the financial crisis, riots and pro-democracy movement that led to Suharto's resignation.
Loss of Kopasus command.
When Suharto resigned on 21 May 1998, Muchdi accompanied Prabowo to the Jakarta residence of new president B.J. Habibie at 11pm to present a draft cabinet line-up and recommended changes to the military leadership. Later that night, Muchdi reported to a gathering of Muslim leaders the meeting with Habibie had gone well. However, Habibie instead favored General Wiranto, who recommended Muchdi be sacked as Kopassus chief. After Habibie agreed, Wiranto instructed Army chief Subagyo Hadiswoyo to relieve Prabowo and Muchdi of their duties.
During the May 1998 riots, Wiranto had assigned Kopassus officers, under the command of Muchdi, to protect Habibie's Jakarta house. These officers outnumbered the presidential guards at Habibie's house on 21 May and initially refused to leave without orders from Muchdi, but were convinced to leave on the evening of 22 May. On the afternoon of 22 May, Prabowo met with Muchdi at the state palace. Prabowo wanted more time before he and Muchdi would be transferred to non-combat positions, to create the perception that it was a normal military rotation, but Wiranto insisted on the changes being made immediately. On the morning of 23 May, Subagyo removed Muchdi from the command of Kopassus. Major-General Syahrir was sworn-in as the new Kopassus chief on May 25.
Muchdi was shifted to the non-combat role of deputy inspector general of TNI. On 1 March 2001, Muchdi was among 55 generals present at an Army headquarters meeting that agreed the Army should never try to seize power.
Abductions of activists.
From early 1997 to May 1998, Kopassus troops kidnapped 23 pro-democracy activists with the aim of intimidating opponents of Suharto's autocratic regime. One of the activists was found dead, nine were released and 13 never reappeared. Survivors said they were tortured. Responding to demands for justice after Suharto's resignation in May 1998, TNI convened an Officers Honor Council, which in August 1998 found that Prabowo and Muchdi bore responsibility for the abductions.
According to "The Indonesian Army" by Joseph Daves, the Officers Honor Council decided Prabowo and Muchdi should be granted immunity from civil prosecution in return for their cooperation. The two reportedly said Suharto gave verbal orders to abduct dissidents and subsequently to “finish them off”. The Officers Honor Council ruled Prabowo and Muchdi had misinterpreted Suharto's order.
Chief of the Officers Honor Council, General Subagyo Hadisiswoyo, said Prabowo and Muchdi either gave instructions for the abductions or were aware of their issuance. He said Muchdi, as Kopassus chief, must have fully understood his authority and duties. In 2008, when Muchdi was tried for orchestrating the murder of human rights activist Munir, his lawyer argued he had no connection to the abductions because he was in Kalimantan when they took place. In a 2008 interview, Muchdi said he had actually ordered the release of the remaining activists when he became Kopassus chief.
Treason allegation.
In March 2001, President Abdurrahman Wahid accused Forestry Ministry secretary general Suripto of meeting with Muchdi at Jakarta's Kempinski Hotel to plot treason. Police questioned Muchdi, who said he had met with Suripto only to discuss logging concessions. Suripto also denied plotting treason. He said Muchdi owns a timber company in West Kalimantan, so they had met several times at Suripto's office to discuss the timber business. Wahid was impeached and removed from office four months later.
BIN career.
In June 2000, detikcom online news portal speculated Muchdi had been nominated to replace Air Vice Marshal Ian Santoso as director of the Strategic Intelligence Agency (BAIS, responsible to Military Headquarters), while there was also a claim Prabowo had advised then-President Abdurrahman Wahid to appoint Muchdi as head of the State Intelligence Coordinating Agency (Bakin, responsible to the President), which was headed by Lieutenant General Arie J. Kumaat. BAKIN was in January 2001 restructured and renamed the State Intelligence Agency (BIN). After Abdurrahman Wahid was impeached in July 2001, his successor Megawati Sukarnoputri appointed Hendropriyono to lead BIN on 9 August 2001. In December 2001, Muchdi was appointed Deputy V of BIN. In March 2005, he was positioned as a BIN principal agent. In April 2003, he retired from the military and had the status of a Group 4 civil servant. On 1 January 2008, he retired as a Group 4 civil servant.
Terrorism investigations and infiltration.
After the October 2002 Bali bombings that left 202 people dead, Muchdi – in his capacity as deputy head of BIN – headed a joint intelligence task force that complemented the police investigation into the terror attack. The formal separation of the Indonesian Military and Police in 1999 had compromised the intelligence capabilities of the police force, which lacked a database on radical groups. Hence, Muchdi's task force was required to provide police with military intelligence, as BIN had a database on extremists. Muchdi's group reportedly pursued suspects in Sumbawa, West Nusa Tenggara province. Two weeks after the bombings, BIN asked police to arrest seven suspects, but police were unable to make the arrests based on BIN's evidence.
The Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI), founded by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, suspected it had been penetrated by BIN operatives. "Tempo" magazine in December 2002 reported a senior BIN operative, Abdul Harris, had entered MMI at its inception and served as head of its international relations division. His true identity was reportedly exposed during a meeting of Muslim leaders at a religious gathering at Muchdi's house. According to the book "After Bali: The Threat of Terrorism in Southeast Asia", Muchdi introduced Harris to the Muslim leaders as a “BIN operative”.
Munir murder trial and acquittal.
In August 2008, Muchdi went on trial at South Jakarta District Court, accused of soliciting and planning the September 2004 murder of human rights activist Munir. The killing was perpetrated by an off-duty Garuda pilot and alleged BIN agent named Pollycarpus Budihari Priyanto. In earlier trials, Garuda chief executive Indra Setiawan testified he had met with Muchdi and received a verbal and written request from BIN to assign Pollycarpus to a flight that Munir made from Jakarta to Singapore.
Evidence showed 41 phone calls were made between Pollycarpus and Muchdi in the days surrounding the murder. Budi Santoso, a former BIN director, told police in October 2007 and May 2008 that Pollycarpus and BIN agent Kawan had told him Muchdi ordered them to kill Munir. Budi further said he had often seen Pollycarpus inside Muchdi's office at BIN headquarters. When Muchdi went on trial, Budi failed to appear as a witness. Prosecutors argued Muchdi carried a grudge against Munir, as the activist's exposure of the 1997-98 abductions had led to Muchdi losing his position as Kopassus chief. Muchdi's lawyers responded that Muchdi had lost his position because of the fall of Suharto and not because of Munir's actions. Some activists asserted Munir's assassination was masterminded by officials higher than Muchdi.
Soldiers, intelligence officials and thugs were present during Muchdi's trial, prompting complaints it was an effort to intimidate judges, prosecutors and witnesses. Some witnesses failed to appear, and others who had previously provided incriminating statements to police withdrew them at trial. Tensions were evident at the trial when Munir's widow Suciwati urged Muchdi to tell the truth. He responded by snapping at her, “Shut up, you!” before he exited.
Muchdi was acquitted on December 31, 2008. In June 2009, the Supreme Court rejected an appeal. Indonesia's National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM) said the investigation, prosecution and trial of Muchdi were flawed, and recommended a new police investigation. President Joko Widodo promised to resolve the case but there has been no follow-up.
Prior to his acquittal, Muchdi said those who pushed for his trial are the "henchmen of foreign imperialism", trying to destabilize Indonesia's national resilience. He claimed their long-term goal is to weaken Indonesia's justice, political, economic and religious institutions. He said Dutch agencies that investigated the murder of Munir cannot be trusted because the Dutch previously colonized Indonesia and committed human rights violations. He said the only state institution in Indonesia that had not been infiltrated by foreign interests was the judiciary. 
After Muchdi's acquittal, three floral congratulatory boards were delivered to his South Jakarta residence. All three were from PT Bayu Buana Gemilang, a natural gas trading company where his son and daughter work. Muchdi celebrated his acquittal by treating 40 orphans to a thanksgiving dinner at his house in Kebayoran Baru neighborhood. Commenting on the verdict, he said, "This is a gift for the nation of Indonesia."
In 2016, Muchdi said Indonesian human rights campaigners still calling for Munir's case to be resolved were merely exploiting the case in order to gain funds from the Netherlands.
Political career.
In 2008, Muchdi joined Prabowo's newly formed Gerindra Party and served as deputy chairman. He became “non-active” in the party pending his murder trial but resumed his position after being acquitted at the end of 2008. 
In June 2010, Muchdi attempted to become Central Executive of Indonesia's second-largest Muslim organization, Muhammadiyah, even though he did not meet the requirement of being a member for at least six years.
In February 2011, Muchdi quit Gerindra and joined the Islam-based United Development Party (PPP), saying "only PPP is still purely Islamic today”. He declined to explicitly explain his reason for leaving, but Gerindra member Desmon Junaidi Mahesa said Muchdi's move to PPP was an effort to raise support for Prabowo in the 2014 presidential election. In March 2011, Muchdi declared he would run for the leadership of PPP, despite having joined the party only a month earlier. He claimed that as an Islamic activist, he wanted to reverse PPP's declining popularity in elections.
In May 2011, Muchdi was elected head of the Daily Regional Leadership Council (DPW) of PPP for Papua province for the period 2011–2015. Party officials in the province hoped his leadership would mobilize Papuans to vote for PPP in future general elections. However, PPP officials in Jakarta rejected Muchdi's election as illegal, claiming the voting process was legally flawed. Muchdi responded by filing a police complaint against four senior PPP members, accusing them of slander and defamation. In June 2011, when PPP held a congress in the West Java capital of Bandung to elect a new leader, Muchdi withdrew from the race, saying he was ineligible to stand for the position.
In January 2012, it was reported Muchdi had joined the National Republic Party (Nasrep) of former president Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as Tommy Suharto. Muchdi served as a member of the party's advisory council and officials hoped he would strengthen the party's political machinery.
In 2016, when Nasrep merged with another small party, Beringin Karya Party, to form Berkarya Party as a political vehicle for Tommy Suharto, Muchdi was appointed chairman of the party's Honorary Board. In March 2018, Muchdi said he was not bothered by the “small matter” of efforts to link him to Munir's murder, as he had already been found not guilty, so the case was resolved. He said the accusations would actually strengthen Berkarya because of his innocence. He claimed to be unaware Munir's murderer Pollycarpus Priyanto had also joined the party.
Berkarya in 2018 announced it was supporting Prabowo Subianto's candidacy for Indonesia's 2019 presidential election. Muchdi in February 2019 announced he was instead supporting President Joko Widodo's bid for re-election. He said Jokowi, in his first term in office, had achieved more than any other president in Indonesia's reform period, improving roads, ports, airports and industry. Mucdhi said he did not think his friend Prabowo could make such achievements in five years. Berkarya's organizational wing, Laskar Berkarya, demanded that Tommy Suharto immediately dismiss Muchdi from the party, describing his endorsement of Jokowi as an act of betrayal. The reformist Indonesian Solidarity Party (PSI), which supports Jokowi, questioned whether Muchdi was seeking to act as "a destructive Trojan horse from within" or merely looking to create a sensation. PSI official Surya Tjandra said Muchdi's support would not increase Jokowi's electability.
Muchdi's Berkarya faction, called the Presidium of Party Rescuers, on 11 July 2020 held an Extraordinary National Conference (Munaslub), which named Muchdi as chairman of Berkarya. Tommy's faction rejected the Munaslub and said Muchdi and his followers had been dismissed from the party. The Justice and Human Rights Ministry on 30 July 2020 issued decrees recognizing Muchdi's changes to the party's leadership structure.
Business activities.
Muchdi is commissioner of Suryatama Cemerlang Abadi (SCA), a company that produces bottled water branded as Suli 5. The company has at least nine factories in Indonesia and is majority-owned by Muhammadiyah.
Muchdi is the commissioner of PT. Rizki Kacida Reana, a forestry firm that was founded in 2000 and operates a concession of 55,150 hectares in East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan.
Muchdi was in 2014-15 involved in a legal dispute with PT Internasional Islamic Boarding School over the ownership of company shares worth Rp10 billion.
In May 2015, Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti ‘Tutut’ Rukmana appointed Muchdi as chief commissioner of her television network PT Citra Televisi Pendidikan Indonesia (TPI), which was embroiled in an ownership dispute with tycoon Hary Tanoesoedibjo.
In December 2016, Muchdi was present for the inauguration of two associations that planned to resume sand mining and exports from Riau Islands province. The government had banned sand exports in 2007 because of environmental concerns, but the associations said exports of abundant sea sand would benefit the public.
Personal life.
Muchdi is married to Puji Astuti and they have three children: Dewi Kirana Juvirawati, Raditya Muhas Juvirawan and Dias Baskara Dewantara. In November 2014, Dias married Allida Alexandra ‘Andra’ Nurluthvia, the third daughter of racing driver Alex Asmasoebrata. Their wedding reception at Jakarta's Shangri-La Hotel reportedly cost Rp5 billion. Alex said he was proud to be connected to Muchdi because he considers him a true patriot who is reputed to have assisted orphans and Islamic boarding schools. He said he hoped the wedding would bring Andra closer to God and result in her wearing a Muslim headscarf. Andra and Dias were divorced by 2017, and Andra married a nephew of Vice President Jusuf Kalla in January 2018.

István Molnár (painter)

István Molnár (January 27, 1968 – June 21, 1993) was a Hungarian-born Ukrainian and Soviet painter, illustrator and musician.
Biography.
István Molnár was born on January 27, 1968 in the town of Mukachevo, but lived all his life in the city of Uzhhorod. From an early age István was very good at drawing, and at the age of 14 he began his studies at Art College, which started his professional career. Teachers immediately took notice of his extraordinary personality and qualities of a leader and maximalist.
In 1986 István began actively participating in regional, national and international exhibitions, and with his like-minded friends he organized a sensational imaginative association which they called "Left Eye." Their exhibitions were a success and a great interest. This same group later organized a rock band, "St. Pauli Guys," that was the start of a full-fledged creative, carefree. Of 1988 he took a job in the theater as a graphic designer, and began drawing again.
In the works of István Molnár, 1988–1989 was probably the most productive period of his life. During this time he created more than two dozen works that experts and critics associate to the Light period. In autumn 1989, István went to study at the Lviv Art Academy and rose to a whole new level in his development. The city of Lviv was the artistic center of Western Ukraine and the cradle of national traditions. The centuries-old history of Galicia was associated with the Russian Empire, Poland and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and in it many cultures were interwoven. At the Lviv Art Academy, István finally decided on the art direction to take, and it was expressionism. Still, the academy staff did not support Molnár in his choice and even complicated his life as they were able, but he was steadfast in his choice. He studied and practiced by drawing pictures in the style of European and world classics of the early twentieth century, often experimenting. He ended up falling in love with the outstanding work of Austrian expressionist Egon Schiele, engrossed once again, and this time for good.
The creative association "Left Eye" was still developing. István and the others held exhibitions in Uzhhorod and Budapest, followed by collective exhibitions at the Lviv National Museum, Rzeszów, Budapest, Berlin, Chicago, Minneapolis, and Madison. In the US, two of István's works were exhibited: "Wolf-cub" (1990) and "Cats" (1991).
István did not part with his guitar even in the student dormitory. The music world of U2 walked beside him throughout his life and helped him reach new heights in creativity. The works of Egon Schiele influenced him on the deepest level and in 1992 a series of works were created, which Molnár's contemporaries have yet to fully appreciate.
It is important to remember that István was an exchange student. During his studies at the Academy of Arts in Budapest one of the teachers encouraged his students to "learn drawing from this guy." Many students took advantage of opportunity to stay in Budapest.
In the end, István decided to return to Lviv and 1993, the last year of his life, was marked by a new series of paintings: "Totem 1," "Totem 2," "Totem 3" and "Snail." A few days before his passing, he painted his "tree of pain and bitterness". István Molnár died on June 21, 1993 in Uzhhorod. The artistic heritage of István Molnár is disappointingly little. He drew no more than 60 paintings, which were sold to all corners of the world. But his exhibitions are still shown, from time to time there are publications, and TV programs about him have been aired. There is an interest in, and a need for his paintings.

Viera Collaro

Viera Collaro (born 1946) is a Slovak-Danish artist whose work in light art relies on the effects of light on colour, space and reflection. In addition to her artworks and installations, since the early 1990s she has decorated a number of Danish buildings including Copenhagen University's South Campus on Amager. In 2002, she was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and in 2015, she received the prestigious Thorvaldsen Medal.
Biography.
The daughter of a Slovak mother and a Greek father, Collaro was born in Bratislava, then part of Czechoslovakia, on 30 June 1946. She studied at the University of Michigan and at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Working in the United States in the 1960s, she came under the influence of minimalism, pop art and concept art. In particular, she was inspired by the artists Frank Stella and Robert Rauschenberg while her adoption of neon lighting as an art form was based on the work of Dan Flavin. Her familiarization with Danish culture has stemmed in part from her membership since 1991 of the art groups Ny Abstraktion and Grønningen.
Collaro was fascinated by the thriving activity in the city of Copenhagen with all its lights and reflections. The extent to which they influenced her work can be seen in her creations which frequently combine painting, three-dimensional objects and fluorescent tubes. Geometrical figures are also a feature of her work, used either systematically or intuitively. Her "1000 farver" (1000 Colours), created in 1979 in collaboration with Niels Nedergaard, has been exhibited in the National Gallery of Denmark's permanent exhibition (2015–16).
Collaro is considered a pioneer in the integration of light art and architecture. One of her earlier architectural works is "Ringen" (the Ring, 1998) on the façade of Kulturhuset (The House of Culture) in Randers. Among her later architectural achievements are light art applications in Aarhus University (2000), Avedøre Kraftværk 2 (2001), the University of Copenhagen (2003), the Technical University of Denmark (2004), Plejecentret Violskrænten, Grenå (2012), and the Danish Security and Intelligence Service, Søborg (2013). Art museums throughout Denmark have hosted her solo exhibitions.

<doc id="56676013" url="?curid=56676013" title="Resia gens">
Resia gens

The gens Resia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. The Resii traced their ancestry to Fertor Resius, King of the Aequicoli, in the time of the Roman monarchy. However, few members of this gens are mentioned in history.
Origin.
According to tradition, Fertor Resius was King of the Aequicoli, an Oscan-speaking people better known as the Aequi, a confederation of hill tribes whom together with the Volsci came into regular conflict with the nascent Roman Republic during the fifth century BC. An Old Latin inscription discovered on the Palatine Hill records that Resius taught the Roman people the "ius fetiale", the law prescribing the manner in which an ambassador should approach another people to demand redress for various grievances, or deliver a formal declaration of war:
"Fert[o]r Resius, Rex Aequicolus, is preimus ius fetiale paravit inde p(opulus) R(omanus) discipleinam excepit."&lt;br&gt;Fertor Resius, King of the Aequicoli, first instituted the "ius fetiale". From him the Roman people acquired the discipline.
Livy describes this procedure as it was first adopted by Ancus Marcius, the fourth King of Rome, in the latter part of the seventh century BC, and reports that the "ius fetiale" was adopted from the Aequicoli, although he does not name Resius. Dionysius discusses the institution of the fetiales and the "ius fetiale" under Numa Pompilius, the second King of Rome, and mentions the tradition that the law originated with the Aequicolae, together with an alternative tradition, mentioned by the historian Gnaeus Gellius, attributing the "ius fetiale" to the people of Ardea, but like Livy he does not name their king.
Praenomina.
The legendary Fertor Resius bore an otherwise unknown praenomen, which some scholars have amended to "Sertor", a known but archaic name; but the current consensus is that "Fertor" is a separate name. The Resii of historical times bear more conventional praenomina, of which the most frequent appear to have been "Titus" and "Aulus". Other names used by the Resii include "Gaius", "Manius", and "Marcus".
Branches and cognomina.
There is no evidence that the Resii were ever divided into distinct families, and all of their surnames have the appearance of personal cognomina, such as "Asper", rough, "Aster", a star, "Genialis", genial, and "Severus", stern. "Albanus" would probably belong to a class of surnames derived from the town of the bearer's origin, perhaps indicating that his family had lived in the Alban Hills. "Patruus", the surname of one of the Resii from Vicentia in Venetia and Histria, referred to a paternal uncle, and probably served to distinguish him from his nephew and namesake. A number of other surnames borne by freedmen would have been their original personal names, prior to their manumission.
Several women of this gens bore surnames derived from old praenomina, which served the same individualizing function, although placed after the gentilicium, such as "Gaia", the feminine of "Gaius"; "Paula", little; "Prima", a name given to the eldest daughter in a family; and "Rufa", red-haired. "Victoria" presumably refers to the goddess of the same name.

<doc id="56676126" url="?curid=56676126" title="Sip Canal">
Sip Canal

The Sip Canal () was a ship canal on the Danube, in eastern Serbia. It was constructed as part of a massive international effort to make the navigation through the most dangerous sections of the Iron Gates gorge safer and easier. Open in 1896, with participation of three royal heads of state, the Sip Canal was flooded in 1969 when the artificial Đerdap Lake was formed after the dam of the Iron Gate I Hydroelectric Power Station on the Danube was built. In terms of navigation, it was the most important of all 7 canals cut through the gorge.
Origin.
The Iron Gate gorge was notorious for the riverbed boulders and river rapids, which were hard to navigate through even for the most seasoned ferrymen. During the Ottoman rule, the ships were guided through by the local navigators who were familiar with the routes. They were called "kalauz" (from Turkish "kalavuz", meaning guide, travel leader). During the rule of prince Miloš Obrenović, local Serbs gradually took over from the Ottomans. The Serbian navigators were officially appointed by prince Miloš. To alleviate the Ottomans, the prince named Serbian navigators by a Turkish name, "dumendžibaša", from "dümen" (rudder) and "baş" (head, chief, master). The navigation fee was divided in three parts, among "dumendžibaša", "loc" (river pilots) and the local municipalities. The local navigators were described in the works of Vuk Karadžić and Mateja Nenadović.
At the Congress of Berlin in 1878, Serbia was recognized as a fully independent state, while Austria-Hungary was given a task of constructing the future Sip Canal. The task was then relegated to the Hungarian government. Hungarian government has been drafting the projects already in 1831. Several plans were later made by the Austrio-Hungarian government and the Austro-Ottoman commission, but the Hungarian government formed its own commission for the navigation project which finished its work in 1883.
Construction.
Hungarian government enlisted a large number of workers and engaged a numerous and heavy machinery. The construction was a massive enterprise which resulted in construction of several canals:
In total, 15,465 m (50,738 ft) of navigable canals was created. Total length of all canals was while of embankments were also built. They were flooded when the artificial Lake Đerdap was created (circa 1970).
Works in the gorge section were done by the Hungarian Technical Administration, over the period of 11 years, starting in 1889. The works were divided in two sectors, the upper and the lower Iron Gates. The canals in the upper section, at the town of Orșova (the tripoint between Austria-Hungary, Romania and Serbia at the time) were up to 60 m (197 ft) wide and 2 m (7 ft) deep, at the zero water level in Orșova. In the southern section, the canals were 60 m (197 ft) wide and 3 m (10 ft) deep, except for the Sip Canal, which was wider and deeper.
Construction of the canal began on 17 September 1890. It was cut in the right bank of the Danube and cost 10 million golden dinars at the time. Some of high quality stone was used. The canal was ceremonially open on 27 September 1896, with cannon salvo. The ceremony was attended by the king Alexander I of Serbia, emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria and king Carol I of Romania.
Characteristics.
The Sip Canal had a total length of , it was wide and up to deep. At the lowest water level it was still deep, which allowed the navigation of large river ships.
Unlike other canals, which were dug into the rocky riverbed of the Deanube, the Sip Canal was cut into the bank. The upstream navigation lasted for 24 minutes, while downstream it took only 3 minutes to pass through the canal.
As the canal was located close to the village of Sip, it was named after it. The village was flooded in 1969 and the new settlement, called Novi Sip ("New Sip") was built instead. It is located northwest from Kladovo.
History.
Beginning.
The first boat which navigated through the Sip Canal was a 600 hp tugboat. Among the first ships on the opening day was also a steamboat "Franz Joseph I". An elegant, long ship was built in 1873. A technical marvel of its day, as of 2016 it was still in use. It operated on the Wolfgangsee, at St. Gilgen in Austria.
It soon became evident that the planners miscalculated. The river flow was still fast, actually it increased to and remained an obstacle for the ships navigating upstream. In order to make the navigation easier, a steam-powered tugboat "Vaškap" was employed in 1899 to tug the boats upstream. The "Vaškap" was specifically built by Austria-Hungary for this purpose and the steam engine was winding the cable on the winch.
World War I.
During the World War I, German occupational forces in Serbia constructed a railway next to the canal, on the embankment. It was long and the locomotives began tugging the boats instead of the tugboat. Open in 1916, the rail was originally served by three switcher locomotives which used the steel cables for tugging. Each had 400 hp. During their withdrawal in 1918, Germans disabled the railway.
After the war, the canal and the railway were reconstructed, with the rail being extended for additional . A total of 11 locomotives was used during the period when the rail was operational. Locomotives were followed by a steam wagon, which had its own operator. The wagon had a steam operated winch on which the ship cables were hooked.
World War II.
After the war, Serbian military devised a backup plan to disable the canal. The tugging locomotives with freight cars were to be crashed into the canal, with cars being filled with cement. Above them, two barges filled with stones were to be demolished in explosion and to fall down on the train compositions, blocking the canal. The barges were to be tugged by the "Vitez" tugboat, from Tekija. Other railway and canal facilities were also planned for demolition. After the Yugoslav coup d'état that toppled the pro-German government on 27 March 1941, the charges for demolition were set, as it was expected war might broke out any moment. 
In the World War II the strategic importance of the canal was significant as the connection with the Black Sea, and especially because much of the Romanian oil shipments from Ploiești to Germany passed through it. Thanks to their spy network, Germans found out about the plan for disabling the canal. Main traitors were the mayor of Kladovo, Leonid Čudnovski, and the local restaurant owner whose name is still not known today. The border and the canal were guarded by the 8th Artillery Regiment of the Krajina Division. On 5 April 1941, Čudnovski invited regiment's officers to a drinking party he personally organized for them in the restaurant "Dubrovnik". Among the officers were 2nd lieutenants Bora Todorović, commander of the artillery battery, and Stevan Marković, commander of the anti-aircraft unit.
After the closing time was announced in the restaurant, Čudnovski invited officers to move to his place and continue the party. There, he poured the sleeping drug in their drinks. In the meantime, Germans executed their elaborate and surprise attack. Wearing a typical Serbian folk attire, 54 German commandos crossed the Danube from Romanian side by boats. Members of the special Brandenburgers regiment, they were commanded by colonel . Majority headed directly to the canal, while a smaller group went to the mayor's house in Kladovo. Germans killed all the officers, even those fully drugged. However, not all of them were asleep, so there was a short shootout, enough to alarm others in town.
Remaining soldiers in two artillery batteries and some gendarmes and infantry, though without commanders, resisted surprisingly strong, especially compared to the later events of the April War, but to no avail. Germans captured the entire security stuff and intact tugging machinery, so they removed the demolition charges. They also cut phone and telegraph lines, but the shootout from Kladovo alarmed other officers. Janko Grgić, the captain of "Vitez", presuming what the shooting means, alarmed the crew, but it took two hours to start and warm all ship engines, and to take the convoy on the river. At the Ada Kaleh island, a German boat opened fire on "Vitez". The fire was reciprocated, but it was just a decoy as the Germans withdrew, making the convoy even more late.
Two helmsmen, Aca Ristić and Krsta Veljošević, managed to steer the barges into the canal and to sink them. However, as the locomotives and freight cars weren't sunk before them, it had no effect, except in the periods of really low water levels when the canal was out of use during the war. Captain Grgić was wounded, but he managed to take "Vitez" out of the hail of German bullets and to sink the tugboat several kilometres downstream, to avoid Germans capturing it. A mock re-staging of the attack by fully uniformed troops in broad daylight was later shot for the German propaganda newsreel about the Balkans campaign, showed on 2 May 1941.
Though the official historic version after the war was that the Invasion of Yugoslavia began in the morning of 6 April 1941, with massive bombing of major cities, especially of Belgrade, the war in Yugoslavia started on the night 5/6 April with the raid on Sip canal.
Submerging.
The profession of "loc", a river pilot, survived until the area was flooded. At one point, there were 29 of them in Sip. At the entrance into the gorge, regardless of the flag under which the ship navigates, the captains were handing over the ship commands to the "loc". They were so esteemed, that insurance companies were not paying for the damages on the ships which had no "loc".
Bad calculations followed the ending of Sip Canal, too. The Sip Locomotive Tugging facilities were flooded by the rising Đerdap Lake in 1969, six months before it was projected. The water rushed one morning into the facility, flooding everything. The entire railway and the last two locomotives are today on the bottom of the lake. The locomotives, JŽ class 30 locomotive 30-031 and 30-034, called "berlinke" ("she-Berliners"), were built in 1930. They had three-cylinder steam engines and were produced in the in Berlin. For a while, some German institutions were interested into dragging the locomotives out of the water, as they are the last remaining locomotives of this design today, and to exhibit them in some of the Berlin's museums.
Today, with the artificial lake and flooded gorge, the navigation through Danube is easy and safe.

Stundin

Stundin is an Icelandic bi-weekly newspaper known for investigative journalism. It takes the form of both an online newspaper and a news magazine. It was founded in 2015 by former staff of DV after a hostile takeover of the paper. It was funded through the Karolina Fund platform and reached its goal of five million Icelandic krónas in two days. The chief editors of the paper are and . They each own a 12 percent share in the company.
History.
"Stundin" was founded in 2015 by journalists and others that were previously employed by "DV" ("Dagblaðið Vísir"), another Icelandic newspaper. They claimed the new management of "DV" had interrupted the work of its journalists. As of November 2016, the unique online readership of "Stundin" per week was about 94,100.
During the Panama Papers scandal, "Stundin" collaborated with "Reykjavík Media" to publish information from the Panama documents showing Landsbankinn, an Icelandic bank, acted as a customer for Mossack Fonseca.
In November 2019, "Stundin" collaborated with RÚV and Al Jazeera to report the involvement of Samherji, an Icelandic fishing company, in the Fishrot Files scandal.
Glitnir coverage.
On 16 October 2017, the Reykjavík District Commissioner placed an injunction on "Stundin" and "Reykjavík Media", forbidding them from reporting about leaked documents pertaining to Glitnir, an Icelandic bank. 
The finances of the Prime Minister of Iceland, Bjarni Benediktsson and those who were connected to him were the focus of "Stundin"'s coverage of the Glitnir documents. The injunction was placed after "Stundin" and "Reykjavík Media" cooperated with The Guardian to publish information about Bjarni's financial activities. 
The Icelandic government received criticism from advocates of press freedom due to the injunction. This included the Journalists' Union of Iceland and the OSCE. In February 2018, the injunction was removed by the Reykjavík District Court, and this was upheld by an appeals court. The Supreme Court of Iceland rejected every legal claim made by Glitnir, siding with "Stundin".

Playbour

Playbour (sometimes spelled playbor) is a hybrid form of play and labour, specifically in the digital games industry. 
History.
The term was coined by Julian Kücklich in 2005 in his article "Precarious playbour: Modders and the digital games industry." Kücklich describes playbour as a type of free labour that fits neither traditional definitions of work nor the categories of play or leisure. Kücklich argues that the labor of gaming and the work that gamers put in to modifying the games they play should be recognized as labor that produces capital for others. Nevertheless, forms of playbour are often incorrectly perceived as being just an extension of play. Playbour is also sometimes categorized as a part of the gamification of society in general.
While the term playbour itself is a relatively new invention, the phenomena it concerns – those of productive leisure and free labour in the digital games industry – have been around at least since the late 1990s. Kücklich states that since the early 1990s, the relationship between the players of digital games and the digital games industry has changed substantially. He attributes the alteration to the rise of computer game modification, or "modding", as a widespread practice among players.
By 2012, the term playbour was expanded upon by Trebor Scholz. In his talk at re:publica in 2016, Scholz touched on How Platform Cooperativism Can Unleash the Network. As he argues, worker cooperatives (or co-ops for short) are not a new concept. They are for-profit “business enterprises owned and governed by their employees”, without a traditional shareholder structure. In 2004, the U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives (USFWC) was created to provide a national membership organization for worker cooperatives. Not only do they foster quality, empowering jobs for members of the community, but often exercise sustainable business practices as compared to other corporate businesses enterprises. In this democratic workplace environment, workers align themselves behind the principle of ‘one worker, one vote’, with equal representation on the board of directors. Beyond this, however, he argues we must address this issue of ownership. In 2014, Scholz proposed a theory of platform cooperativism.
Scholz argues for this alternative model of ownership to apply to modern gig economy companies. He continues to argue that the problem is not the technology: platforms are both efficient and scalable. It is the ownership structure, itself, that guides whether or not a platform can be considered influential, and consequently, participating in the notion of platform cooperativism. 
Scholz asks what motivates playbour and other participatory labor pursuits in his book "Uberworked and Underpaid". Relating the way companies such as Facebook, Google, and Apple (among others) push the burden of labor onto consumers as “whitewashing the fence for the twenty-first century,” a reference to the classic Adventures of Tom Sawyer narrative, the issue of motivation and promised outcomes becomes complicated as users are expected to engage in labor for free in order to enjoy the benefits of different technologies. Scholz argues that this is a deceptive strategy, “[making] it look as if [corporations] are merely helping people to do the work that they are keen to do already.” 
Modding.
Creating mods for digital games is the perfect example of playbour: a growing number of consumers of digital games are not satisfied with just playing the game, but prefer to enhance their playing experience by creating content for the game themselves. In modding we can see the very essence of playbour, or free labour: while the work of creating a modification can be seen as playful and enjoyable, it is still work. In this respect modding can be fairly similar to another form of collaborative digital production; open-source software development. The first game to gain a modder base of considerable size is widely agreed to be Doom (1993). The emergence of Doom mods is usually attributed to the fact that the game's code was deliberately designed to facilitate player-created content. The most famous modder creation is probably Counter-Strike, originally a team-based mod for Half-Life (1998). It later also became the first commercially released mod. 
Modders have formed robust online communities to share their mods and collaborate with each other. The website Nexus Mods hosts over 280,000 mod files for over 1,000 games. The site also features modding tools and tutorials for mod developers, as well as discussion forums for its 23,000,000+ members. Modding has become an important part of the video game industry.
In 2012, the developers of Skyrim, Bethesda Game Studios, created their own modding kit called “The Creation Kit.” The Creation Kit was a free software development tool that enabled users to alter game content. The software also allowed the user to share their mods once they were complete. They could release the mods publicly to the authorized Steam Workshop Channel.
Controversy around playbour and modding.
Not only is modding a big part of gaming culture, but it is also an increasingly important source of value for the digital games industry. Game companies usually retain the intellectual property rights of the modifications. Since players need to have a copy of the original game to run the modifications, mods may add to the shelf-life of the product. In addition to that, mods may help with establishing brands (e.g. Counter-Strike), thus saving companies a significant amount of money. Marketing costs often take up a large percentage of a game's budget, but successfully established brands require less marketing. Mods also increase customer loyalty and are an important source of innovation in the digital games industry. Another way that game companies can benefit from the modding culture is that they can recruit modders as employees who are already trained at no cost to the company.
While game companies may benefit economically from playbour, the players doing the work are not entirely uncompensated: they may obtain virtual in-game rewards or social capital such as followers on social media. Some modding sites, like Nexus Mods, have started to use crowdfunding tools like Patreon to raise money for mod authors. The experience of play also has value in itself. Playbour is a voluntary activity and players don't usually view modding as labour. Nevertheless, it has been suggested that playbour modders are exploited by the games industry.

H. W. B. Joseph

Horace William Brindley Joseph, FBA (28 September 1867 – 13 November 1943), published as H. W. B. Joseph, was a British philosopher, who spent his academic career as a Fellow and Tutor at New College, Oxford.
Biography.
Early life.
Horace William Brindley Joseph was born at Chatham, Kent, on 28 September 1867, the eldest surviving son of Alexander Joseph (died 1890), rector of St John's, Chatham, and Honorary Canon of Rochester Cathedral, and his wife, Janet Eleanor "née" Acworth (died 1917), daughter of George Acworth, a solicitor, and cousin of Sir William Acworth. Joseph attended Allhallows School in Honiton (1877–80) and then Winchester College as a scholar (1880–86; he went on to win three gold medals there and was a prefect). In 1886 he went up to New College, Oxford, as a scholar and graduated with a first-class degree in "Literae Humaniores" (classics) in 1890, winning the Junior Greek Testament Prize in 1889 and the Arnold Historical Essay Prize in 1891, the same year he was elected a Fellow of New College and appointed a lecturer in Philosophy.
Career.
Joseph was appointed a Tutor at New College in 1892 and, when Alfred Robinson died in 1895, he became New College's Senior Philosophy Tutor (he remained in the position until 1932) and Junior Bursar (until 1919). He was also the University of Oxford's Senior Proctor for the 1906–07 academic and Public Examiner for "Literae Humaniores" from 1910 to 1912 and again from 1921 to 1922. His philosophy was "firmly rooted" in Plato and Aristotle's and he was the University of Oxford's foremost lecturer on Plato's "Republic"; nevertheless, in his career he took greatest satisfaction out of his role as a tutor. His first book was "An Introduction to Logic" (1906; 2nd edition, 1916), and this was followed by "The Labour Theory of Value in Karl Marx" (1923) and "Some Problems in Ethics" (1931); in 1930, he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA). He retired in 1932, when he became a Supernumerary Fellow at New College; he published a collection of his essays, mostly earlier ones, as "Essays in Ancient and Modern Philosophy" (1935), including his Herbert Spencer Lecture "The concept of evolution" (1924), which Clement C. J. Webb and C. A. Creffield in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography" consider "perhaps the most important of his philosophical writings". Another work, "Knowledge and the Good in Plato's Republic", was published in 1948, after Joseph had died, and across his career he had published several important articles in "Mind"; the journal carried an obituary of him when he died.
In retirement, Joseph continued to teach at New College and also served as a member of Oxford City Council and Chairman of its Education Committee. He lived in College during term, but stayed with his mother during vacations at Holford and then from 1912 at Dinder. In 1919 he married Margaret (died 1926), a daughter of Robert Bridges, but there were no children of their happy union. He established a music scholarship in her memory at his college and, after he died in the Acland Home, Oxford, on 13 November 1943, New College erected a memorial tablet to Joseph and his wife in its cloisters.

Aviapark

Aviapark () is a six-storey shopping center in the Khoroshyovsky District of Moscow, Russia. At 390,000 square meters of total space and 230,000 square meters of leasable area, it is the first largest shopping mall in Europe.
It opened in November 2014 with more than 500 stores and a four-story aquarium that extends to the ceiling of the retail section. The aquarium was recognized by Guinness World Records as the tallest cylindrical aquarium in the world at in the world.
Location.
The property is in the Aeroport District of Moscow, on the grounds of the former Khodynka Aerodrome. There is no direct access to the mall on the Moscow Metro; however the CSKA, Aeroport, Dinamo and Polezhayevskaya stations are a short distance and the mall provides free shuttle buses from some stations for customers.
Development and Ownership.
The property was developed by AMMA Development, which was founded by Mikhail Zaits. The only major shareholder is Mikhail Zaits.
In 2017, media reports suggested that Gazprombank was, at one point, involved in the mall’s ownership. The bank initially provided a $560 million construction loan on the mall. Kommersant reported that, as part of a restructuring, Aviapark Mall Holdings received an option to buy the remaining stake from Gazprombank, which it exercised, removing the bank from the ownership structure.
It received its GPZU, or approved development plan, in June 2012 and began construction later that year. The opening was projected for the fourth quarter of 2014. Jones Lang LaSalle was named as the property’s leasing agent.
Major Retailers.
The mall’s anchors include French retailer Auchan, the home improvement chain OBI, IKEA, Stockmann, Sephora and H&amp;M. Karo, a Russian theater chain, operates a 17-screen cinema, one of the largest in Russia.

Edward King-Tenison

Edward King Tenison (21 January 1805 – 19 June 1878) was an Irish Whig and Liberal politician and photographer.
Early life and family.
Born in 1805 at Kilronan Castle, King Tenison was the son of Thomas Tenison and Lady Frances King. He was also the grandson of Edward King, 1st Earl of Kingston, and cousin of Robert King, 6th Earl of Kingston. He was educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge where he achieved an MA before, in 1825, joining the army and serving as an officer of the 14th Light Dragoons until 1836.
Having retired from the army, he then served as a Justice of the Peace and High Sheriff for County Leitrim, County Roscommon and County Sligo, and later became a Lord Lieutenant for Roscommon and Sligo.
In 1838, he married travel writer and artist Lady Louisa Mary Anne Anson, daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield and Louisa Catherine Philips. Together, they had two children: Louisa Frances Mary (died 1868) and Florence Margaret Christine Tenison (1845–1907).
Photography.
In the 1840s, he took up photography, beginning with daguerreotypes and paper negatives, after receiving a licence granted by former Chippenham MP William Henry Fox Talbot.
Between 1850 and 1852, King Tenison and his wife travelled in Spain for their artwork where, as an early adopter of the calotype photographic process, he aroused suspicion and curiosity due to his bulky equipment and outdoor work. The work was later published as "Memories of Spain" in 1854, while his wife's 50 lithographs appeared in "Castile and Anadalucia" in 1853.
In 1853, he joined the Photographic Society of London, and first displayed his work at the Great Industrial Exhibition in Dublin. The next year, he then helped to found the Dublin Photographic Society.
Further works of his were later put on display in London between 1854 and 1855, encompassing photos taken using calotype and waxed paper processes in Spain, Belgium and Normandy. He then travelled to Algeria, before concluding his career taking photos in his home nation of Ireland.
An album of his work, calotypes and salt print photos of Ireland taken in 1858, is now preserved in the National Photographic Archive in Dublin, while further work is held in private collections. In 1999, one album was sold at Christie's for more than $10,000.
Political career.
King Tenison first stood for election in 1830 at Roscommon but was unsuccessful. He was later elected MP for Leitrim in 1847 – standing on civil and religious liberty, opposing anti-Catholic measures – but stood down at the next general election in 1852. King Tenison sought to be MP for the seat again in 1857 as well as in 1859 for Roscommon, but was both times unsuccessful. He also stood at a by-election in Sligo Borough in 1860, but retired from the race after refusing to offer bribes to Liberal electors. His final attempt for parliament in 1865, at Leitrim, was also unsuccessful.
Death.
King Tenison died at Kilronan Castle in June 1878, while his wife died at Trieste, Italy in September 1882.

Eli Bush

Eli Bush is an American film and theatre producer and former executive at Scott Rudin Productions. He is best known for producing the film "Lady Bird", for which he co-won the 2018 Golden Globe Award for Best Picture - Musical or Comedy and was co-nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture.
In an April 2021 "Vulture" exposé about Rudin's abusive behavior, a former colleague referred to Bush as "sort of Rudin’s Smithers," a reference to the sycophantic right-hand man to Mr. Burns from "The Simpsons". Another compared him to the former Vice President of the United States saying "He's like the Mike Pence of the whole operation. He’s shared an office with Scott all day every day for over 10 years.” The same story reported that Bush had "left" Scott Rudin Productions the previous week.
Biography.
Bush graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 2009.
During his tenure working for Scott Rudin Productions, he and Rudin worked on a number of critically acclaimed movies, including "Uncut Gems" (2019), "Annihilation" (2018), "Eighth Grade" (2018), "Lady Bird" (2017), and "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" (2011). On Broadway, he won four Tony Awards for Best Revival of a Play: for "Death of a Salesman" (2012), "A Raisin in the Sun" (2014), "Skylight" (2015), and "A View from the Bridge" (2016). He also won the Tony Award for Best Musical in 2017 for "Hello, Dolly!" as well as the Tony Award for Best Play in 2016 for producing "The Humans". He was nominated for the 2017 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program for co-producing "School of Rock".
An April 2021 story in "The Hollywood Reporter" alleged numerous instances of abuse from Rudin towards employees, including physical violence. Following the allegations, Rudin announced that he would be "stepping back" to "work on personal issues I should have long ago."
On April 22, 2021, "Vulture" scrutinized Bush's behavior in relation to the Rudin scandal:According to multiple former employees, Eli Bush — who started as an intern and until recently served as a top executive at SRP (with producer credits on films like "Lady Bird, Annihilation", and "Uncut Gems") — was one of the few people to quickly climb the ranks and stay there. “Eli is an amazing survivalist. Nobody does that job with that much proximity to that ruthlessness without a sense of cynicism. When Scott would leave the office, Eli was one of us — air quotes ‘one of us’ — and then when Scott was back, you’re just on your own. He really fucked over a lot of assistants that just were kind of in his way. He’s in this really ugly machine, and I can’t really empathize with a person who stays there for that long,” said Neisser. “It’s one thing if you’re learning the ropes, and you eventually come to understand, in your mid-20s, "Oh, this is bad. I should go." It’s another thing if you really make this your brand.” As another former assistant put it, “It’s like bowling: His job’s to put the pins back up so Scott can go in and knock them back down.” (Through a spokesperson, Bush declined to comment.)

<doc id="56676397" url="?curid=56676397" title="Horn Brigade">
Horn Brigade

The Horn Brigade, also known as the Dutch Brigade, or the “Iron Brigade of the Army of the Cumberland,” was an infantry brigade in the Union Army of the Cumberland during the American Civil War. The brigade fought in the battles of Shiloh, Stones River, Liberty Gap, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, Atlanta, Franklin and Nashville.
Nicknames.
The brigade gained the sobriquet “Horn Brigade” while under the command of August Willich, a former Prussian Army officer who favored using bugle calls to signal movements. It was also known as the Dutch Brigade because of the ethnic makeup of the brigade (mainly the 32nd Indiana) and the brigade commander. Later, it also became known as the “Iron Brigade of the Army of the Cumberland” following its actions on September 20, 1863, when it drove back an entire Confederate division during the Battle of Chickamauga.
History.
The brigade that would later become known as the Horn Brigade originally consisted of the 15th Ohio, 49th Ohio, 32nd Indiana, 39th Indiana and Battery A, 1st Ohio Light Artillery. These units were later joined by the 89th Illinois, 25th Illinois, 35th Illinois, 68th Indiana, 8th Kansas, 15th Wisconsin, and 51st Indiana.
The brigade was known by the following designations:
Johnson's Brigade, McCook's Command, to November 1861. 6th Brigade, Army of the Ohio, to December 1861. 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, Army of the Ohio, to September 1862. 6th Brigade, 2nd Division, I Corps, Army of the Ohio, to November 1862. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, Right Wing, XIV Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to January 1863. 1st Brigade, 2nd Division, XX Corps, Army of the Cumberland, to October 1863. 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IV Corps, to August 1865.
The brigade was further distinguished by a tactic invented by August Willich known as “advance firing,” in which the regiments were organized into four ranks (rather than two), with one rank moving forward, firing, and reloading as it was replaced with the rank farthest to the rear. This tactic was used by the 49th Ohio to great effect at the Battle of Liberty Gap during the Tullahoma Campaign and again by the brigade at the Battle of Chickamauga.
At the Battle of Missionary Ridge, the brigade led the charge against the Confederate lines against orders and was among the first to reach the top of the ridge.

Norway in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019

Norway participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The Norwegian broadcaster Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK) organised the national final "Melodi Grand Prix 2019" in order to select the Norwegian entry for the 2019 contest in Tel Aviv, Israel.
The winning song of the "Melodi Grand Prix 2019" was Spirit in the Sky by KEiiNO. In the Grand Final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2019, Norway won the televote with 291 points, but received only 40 points from the juries, overall finishing in 6th place. Norway therefore became the third country since the introduction of professional jury voting in to lose the contest while having won the televote.
Background.
Prior to the 2019 Contest, Norway had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fifty-seven times since their first entry in . Norway had won the contest on three occasions: in 1985 with the song "La det swinge" performed by Bobbysocks!, in 1995 with the song "Nocturne" performed by Secret Garden and in 2009 with the song "Fairytale" performed by Alexander Rybak. Norway also had the two dubious distinctions of having finished last in the Eurovision final more than any other country and for having the most "nul points" (zero points) in the contest, the latter being a record the nation shared together with Austria. The country had finished last eleven times and had failed to score a point during four contests. Following the introduction of semi-finals in , Norway has only failed to qualify on three occasions. In 2018, Norway was represented by Alexander Rybak for the second time, with the song "That's How You Write a Song". The country placed 15th in the final with 144 points.
The Norwegian national broadcaster, Norsk rikskringkasting (NRK), broadcasts the event within Norway and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. The broadcaster has traditionally organised the national final "Melodi Grand Prix", which has selected the Norwegian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest in all but one of their participations.
Before Eurovision.
"Melodi Grand Prix 2019".
"Melodi Grand Prix 2019" was the 57th edition of the Norwegian national final "Melodi Grand Prix" and selected Norway's entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The show took place on 2 March 2019 at the Oslo Spektrum in Oslo, hosted by Heidi Ruud Ellingsen and Kåre Magnus Bergh. The show was televised on NRK1, NRK TV, broadcast via radio with commentary by Ole Christian Øen on NRK P1 as well as streamed online at NRK's official website "nrk.no". The national final was watched by 961 thousand viewers in Norway with a market share of 68.6%.
Competing entries.
A submission period was opened by NRK between 31 January 2018 and 9 September 2018. Songwriters of any nationality were allowed to submit entries, while performers of the selected songs would be chosen by NRK in consultation with the songwriters. In addition to the public call for submissions, NRK reserved the right to directly invite certain artists and composers to compete. Project leader Stig Karlsen stated that he wanted a participatory field with "celebrities and artists that people know" in the competition, and that NRK would "do an even bigger job to bring forth some new talents as well", making "Melodi Grand Prix 2019" "the largest MGP final". At the close of the deadline, over 1,000 submissions were received. Ten songs were selected for the competition by various focus groups and the competing acts and songs were revealed on 25 January 2019 during a press conference at NRK's Store Studio, presented by Heidi Ruud Ellingsen and Kåre Magnus Bergh and broadcast via NRK1 and online at "mgp.no". Among the competing artists was former Eurovision Song Contest entrant Mørland, who represented Norway in 2015 with Debrah Scarlett. At least two of the artists: Chris Medina and D'Sound were directly invited by NRK to participate in the national final. The competing entries were later premiered after the press conference.
Final.
Ten songs competed during the final on 2 March 2019. The winner was selected over three rounds of voting. In the first round, the top four entries were selected by a 50/50 combination of public televoting and ten international juries to proceed to the second round, the Gold Final: "Mr. Unicorn" performed by D'Sound, "Holla" performed by Anna-Lisa Kumoji, "The Bubble" performed by Adrian Jørgensen and "Spirit in the Sky" performed by KEiiNO. The viewers and the juries each had a total of 580 points to award. Each jury group distributed their points as follows: 1–8, 10 and 12 points. The public vote was based on the percentage of votes each song achieved. For example, if a song gained 10% of the viewer vote, then that entry would be awarded 10% of 580 points rounded to the nearest integer: 58 points. In the Gold Final, the top two entries were selected solely by the public televote to proceed to the third round, the Gold Duel: "The Bubble" performed by Adrian Jørgensen and "Spirit in the Sky" performed by KEiiNO. In the Gold Duel, the results of the public televote were aggregated to the results from the Gold Final and led to the victory of "Spirit in the Sky" performed by KEiiNO with 231,937 votes.
At Eurovision.
According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2019, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Norway was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 16 May 2019, and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show.
Once all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Norway was set to perform in position 15, following the entry from Albania and preceding the entry from Netherlands.
Semi-final.
Norway performed fifteenth in the second semi-final, following the entry from Albania and preceding the entry from Netherlands. At the end of the show, Norway was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that Norway placed seventh in the semi-final, receiving a total of 210 points: 170 points from the televoting and 40 points from the juries.
Voting.
Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.
Detailed voting results.

Skylum

Skylum (formerly Macphun) is a software developing company based in Bellevue, Washington. It is most known for its photo editing software Aurora HDR and Luminar. Skylum is also the developer of Snapheal, Focus, Tonality, Intensify, Noiseless and FX Photo Studio.
Founded as Macphun in 2008, the company decided to change its name to Skylum in 2017, following the decision to develop its Mac only software for Windows as well.
History.
Skylum was founded as Macphun in 2008 by two gaming developers and amateur photographers, Dmitry Sytnik and Paul Muzok. Initially the company developed applications for iOS. One of its first applications was Vintage Video Maker, which was later named Vintagio. In 2009, Apple named Vintagio among Best iPhone apps of the year. Alex Tsepko, Ivan Kutanin &amp; Oksana Milczarek joined the team few years later. In total, the company released over 60 applications in the first three years. However, it saw the greatest number of downloads in the photography applications. Skylum thus decided to develop the same photography applications for macOS.
In early 2010, Skylum launched its first macOS application, FX Photo Studio Pro, which was earlier available for iOS only. Several other applications were also developed for macOS including Snapheal.
In order to tap the North Americas, the company moved its headquarters to San Diego, United States in 2013. A great number of employees came from the Nik Collection, which was earlier acquired by Google. Later that year, the company launched Intensify, a fully featured photo editing software, that was named among 2013 Best Mac App Store apps. In 2014, Skylum launched Tonality, a black-and-white photo editor software, that won Apple’s Editors’ Choice of the year. The same year, Skylum hired a team in Europe to develop localized versions of its software and start European expansion.
In 2015, Skylum released a new image noise reduction application called Noiseless. Same year Skylum partnered with Trey Ratcliff to develop an HDR program. Through the collaboration Aurora HDR, a High Dynamic Range editing and processing tool, was released in November. A year later, Skylum developed Luminar, an all-in-one photo editing software as an alternative to Adobe’s Lightroom. Both the software became the most known applications by the company. 
In 2017, the company released Aurora HDR and Luminar for Windows - software that previously was available for macOS only. At the same time, it was also announced that Macphun would change its name to Skylum.
Products.
Skylum is most known for its photo editing software, Aurora HDR launched in 2015, and Luminar launched in 2016. Other notable software by the company include: Snapheal, Focus, Tonality, Intensify, Noiseless, FX Photo Studio, and Photolemur.
Skylum products have been recognized with multiple awards. In 2019, Skylum took home four gold awards at the Digital Camera Grand Prix. The company was honored for innovation in the photo editing sphere with its Luminar 4, Aurora HDR 2019, and Photolemur editing software. Skylum also took home a technical award for its innovative approach. In 2017 Luminar and in 2019 Luminar Flex was named the Best Software Plugin in the Lucie Technical Awards. In the same years, Luminar was awarded the Best Imaging Software by TIPA. In 2018, Luminar was named an Editor’s Pick by Outdoor Photographer.

Drew Fortier

Andrew Lawrence Fortier (born July 14, 1987) is an American musician, guitarist, filmmaker, actor, and author. He is best known for his work with Bang Tango, David Ellefson, and Zen From Mars; which he cofounded, and includes members of Kik Tracee, Enuff Z'Nuff, Flipp, and Fear Factory. He was guitarist for the now late Chuck Mosley (Faith No More). He has directed and edited the documentary as well as the upcoming David Ellefson produced horror film "Dwellers" which Fortier also wrote and stars in. He is the author of "Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious" which is an autobiography on his career thus far.
Film career.
"Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie".
Fortier took 4 years filming and editing what would become a documentary on 80's hard rock band Bang Tango. Originally intended as a studio documentary, the film became expanded upon once original members of the band became involved and more information was revealed regarding the band's history. The film was never given an official release due to clearance issues regarding usage of Bang Tango's back catalogue of music in the film which is owned by Universal Music.
Aside from the inclusion of various members of Bang Tango throughout the band's career up to that point, interviews featured throughout the film include: Howard Benson, Riki Rachtman, Chris DeMakes, Mandy Lion, Andrew Wilkow, Chip Z'Nuff, as well as an opening narration by Twisted Sister's Dee Snider.
The film had one free public screening in Fortier's hometown of Chicago, Illinois with Bang Tango in attendance in April 2015.
Fortier became a member of Bang Tango days later as the band's second guitarist.
Fortier released the film for free on YouTube in early 2016.
In June 2018, Fortier released an 11 minute deleted/extended scene from the film, which contained footage from being on the road with the band as well as more insight into how the band operates while on tour. Fortier made note that the footage was initially removed from the film due to its portrayal of the band members featured in the scenes.
Reception.
Reviews of the film were positive. The general consensus is that despite its low budget, the film still manages to get its point across in an unbiased, artistic, and engaging manner while being able to appeal to not only fans of the band or genre, but to anyone not familiar with Bang Tango.
"Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie".
Summer 2017, Fortier was recruited as guitarist for (Ex-Faith No More frontman) Chuck Mosley's solo band. During his time with the band, Fortier and Mosley explored the idea of a potential documentary to where Mosley would be the subject. Prior to his passing in November 2017 Mosley confirmed with Fortier that a documentary about his life should be made. The film is being produced by Mosley's long time manager and percussionist, Douglas Esper.
In February 2018 it was announced that "Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie" was officially in production with a TBA release date.
"Dwellers".
In May 2019, it was announced that Fortier will be writing, directing, and starring in the found footage horror film "Dwellers" which is being produced by Megadeth bassist David Ellefson and Thom Hazaert via their newly formed production company Ellefson Films. Along with Fortier, the film will also star James L. Edwards, Douglas Esper, Rick Jermain, and Jeff Hatrix. Ellefson and Hazaert will also be appearing in the film as featured cameos.
In August 2019, Ellefson Films released a 50 second teaser for the film which included a voice over from Canadian radio personality Mitch Lafon.
Ellefson Films hosted a Q&amp;A panel at Rue Morgue's Frightmare in the Falls horror convention where Fortier and Ellefson revealed that the film will be a gritty found footage horror film that plays out as a documentary gone horribly wrong. Dwellers is described as being highly influenced by The Blair Witch Project and C.H.U.D.
The full trailer for "Dwellers" was released via Ellefson Films in November 2019.
Other works.
As a way to hone his filmmaking skills to aid the process of creating and completing "Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie", Fortier experimented with shooting and editing music videos for Bang Tango, which resulted in clips for their songs: "Live Life," "I Like It, Bring on the World," and "Suck It Up" from the "Pistol Whipped in the Bible Belt" album. This led to Fortier, through word of mouth, being hired to produce and edit promotional videos for such acts as: Vince Neil, Slaughter, Queensrÿche, Great White, Kix, Autograph, Lynch Mob, Vixen, Marty Casey, Les Warner, David Ellefson, Mark Slaughter, Jesse Camp, Doll Skin, A Killer's Confession, and more.
After completing "Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie", Fortier was in talks with Fear Factory for a proposed documentary on the band's career. A treatment for the film was drafted which led to meeting with members of the band to speak further about the idea. It was ultimately decided that due to the band's ongoing litigation with former members, it was not the right time for a film to be made.
Music career.
Bang Tango.
After completing and screening "Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie" in April 2015, Fortier would go on to join the film's subject, Bang Tango, as their second guitarist making his live debut with the band at the 2015 edition of the M3 Festival in Maryland. The decision to bring Fortier into the band was at the suggestion of Rowan Robertson who, as Bang Tango's lead guitarist, felt the band should be represented as having two guitarists to properly perform the material which was originally written and recorded with two guitarists.
Despite having Fortier become a member of the band, frontman Joe Leste' showed disdain toward Fortier in the press regarding the way Leste' had been portrayed in the film.
Fortier took a year long break performing with the band to work for Megadeth Bassist David Ellefson's EMP Label Group as their Operations Coordinator. Fortier worked closely with Ellefson and the label's Operations Director Thom Hazaert up until he returned to Bang Tango in August 2017.
Chuck Mosley.
Fortier joined Chuck Mosley's solo band early summer 2017. It was during this time that plans for a documentary on Mosley's life were discussed which would become "Thanks. And Sorry: The Chuck Mosley Movie".
The Lucid.
In September 2021 it was revealed that a new band consisting of Sponge vocalist Vinnie Dombroski, ex-Megadeth bassist David Ellefson, Fear Factory drummer Mike Heller, and Fortier on guitar. The Lucid announced their debut single "Maggot Wind" along with an October 15 release date for their debut self titled album.
Other works.
In 2011, while shooting "Attack of Life: The Bang Tango Movie" and 4 years prior to joining the band, Fortier performed additional guitar and backing vocals on Bang Tango's "Pistol Whipped in the Bible Belt" album. His lead guitar parts can be heard in the choruses of the track "Live Life", and his backing vocals can be heard in the choruses of the song "Boombox Seance". In June 2018, Fortier joined 90's hard rock band Flipp as their guitarist for a one off show in Minnesota.
Acting career.
"Her Name Was Christa".
July 2017, Fortier was cast as a lead role in the horror/comedy "Her Name Was Christa". Directed by, written, and starring James L. Edwards, the film was released in February 2020 to very polarizing reviews.
Writing career.
"Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious".
Fortier wrote an autobiography titled "Dark, Depressing, and Hilarious" which covers his career up until 2018. The book features a foreword by Thom Hazaert.
"Rock Star Hitman".
In November 2020 it was announced that Fortier along with Megadeth bassist David Ellefson had co-written a fiction thriller novel titled "Rock Star Hitman" due for release in December 2020 via The Ellefson Book Co.
Personal life.

2018 NRA boycott

In February 2018, a boycott emerged against the U.S. gun rights advocacy group National Rifle Association (NRA) and its business affiliates. The boycott and social media activism campaign arose in the aftermath of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The NRA was criticized for its response, including its recommendation for schools to arm teachers and opposition to bans on certain weapons. Calls for companies to sever their ties to the NRA resulted in several companies discontinuing their business relationships with the NRA and cancelling discount programs offered to NRA members. The boycott extended to Canada where Mountain Equipment Co-op and the Running Room cut supplier relationships with Vista Outdoor.Public pressure also caused a number of gun retailers to increase the age required to buy firearms and place other restrictions on gun sales.
Background.
After the Parkland shooting, there was an unprecedented upsurge of public support for gun control advocacy groups and significant backlash against the NRA for its response to the shooting, having argued that schools required more armed security to protect against the possibility of future attacks, and its continued calls to preserving the right to own semi-automatic firearms, such as those used in the shooting.
On February 20, 2018, ThinkProgress asked over two dozen corporations offering discounts to NRA members whether they would continue their relationships with the NRA. Several companies terminated their agreements with the NRA, and their announcements went viral, along with hashtags such as #BoycottNRA, started by activists like Michael Skolnik. One of the first to respond to the boycott, First National Bank of Omaha, the largest privately held bank in the United States, announced that it will not renew its deal for the “official credit card of the NRA.”
Companies involved.
Affinity marketing.
One class of companies targeted generally offer or offered discounts or free trials to NRA members, often advertised on the NRA website, in what is often termed affinity marketing. Access to discounts is a benefit of paying NRA membership dues and the NRA promotes the opportunity to save hundreds of dollars more than the cost of membership.
Severed ties.
Companies that have severed ties with the NRA as of February 24, 2018, span banks, airlines, car rental services, hotels, and software companies. They include:
Retained ties.
Several companies have been pressured to disaffiliate with the NRA, but have not, or have not issued statements indicating that they will.
FedEx.
Pressure on FedEx to drop NRA discounts of up to 26 percent had been going on for nearly a year before the Florida shooting. After several companies cut ties with the NRA, calls to boycott FedEx arose on social media under the hashtag #BoycottFedEx. In a statement, FedEx affirmed that while it does not fully agree with the NRA on issues of gun policy, it will continue its business relationship with the organization. Due to a drop in NRA related volume that made the organization ineligible for discounts, the NRA was dropped from the program on October 30, 2018.
Insurance providers.
In response to the NRA boycott several companies discontinued insurance products targeted at NRA members.
Vista Outdoor.
Vista Outdoor manufactures AR-15-style rifles under the Savage Arms brand and ammunition under the CCI and Federal brands as well as a range of bike related and other outdoor products including the Bell, Giro, CamelBak, and Blackburn brands. After the Parkland shooting, consumers called on retailers to stop selling all Vista Outdoor products specifically over the company's support of the NRA.
Bicycle retailers in several states stopped selling all Vista Outdoor products, citing the company's support for the NRA. Some cancelled orders or returned existing stock. Canadian retail cooperative Mountain Equipment Co-op similarly announced on March 1, 2018 that, in response to a petition by its members, it would no longer stock products by Vista Outdoor brands in its 22 stores. The co-op does not sell guns. In the United States Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI) announced that they would stop ordering all Vista Outdoor products due to the company's NRA support. Running Room, Canada's largest dealer of athletic apparel announced it will discontinue Camelbak products across the chain of 120 Canadian and two US stores, citing strong customer support for the move.
Broadcasters of NRA programming.
NRATV, the NRA's online video channel, is a prominent forum used by the organization to disseminate its message and with a large follower base on social media. In the aftermath of the events in Parkland, activists created the hashtags #stopNRAmazon and #DumpNRATV asking Amazon to discontinue streaming programs from NRATV, an initiative supported by celebrities like Alyssa Milano, Denis O’Hare, Evan Handler, Ben Gleib, Joshua Malina, Warren Leight, Genevieve Angelson, Joe Scarborough, Mika Brzezinski, and Misha Collins. Other companies offering NRATV programs as part of their streaming services became the target of a similar campaign launched by Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense and Everytown for Gun Safety.
The following companies continue to stream NRATV, despite petitions for them to stop:
Gun dealers.
On February 28, 2018 Dick's Sporting Goods discontinued the sale of all assault-style rifles, high-capacity magazines and bump stocks. The company also immediately restricted the sale of any guns to customers aged 21 or older. As justification for the move, Dick's praised the Stoneman Douglas students who are campaigning for gun control and for businesses to side against the NRA. They also noted that Dick's had legally sold a shotgun (not used in the assault) to the Parkland shooter.
Dick's also launched a corporate campaign for officials “to enact common sense gun reform” including regulations to require universal background checks, raise the age to purchase guns to 21, and ban the firearms and accessories that Dick's no longer sells.
Since Dick's is a large gun dealer their moves were cited as "one of the biggest steps taken by a US company" after the Parkland shooting energized the gun control debate.
Citing "recent events" on February 28, 2018 Walmart announced it would raise the required age to buy all guns and ammo to 21 and require background checks on all purchasers. Walmart also stopped all sales of air rifles and toys that look like assault rifles on its website and called for tougher gun control measures. Walmart stopped selling semi-automatic rifles in 2015, and has been reducing the number of stores that sell guns for some years. It does not sell handguns (except in Alaska) and it does not sell bump stocks or high capacity magazines. On March 1, 2018, US grocery chain Kroger announced it would stop selling guns and ammunition to people under 21 at 45 of its Fred Meyer locations. Their grocery stores do not sell firearms, but did sell a variety of gun periodicals until March 16, 2018, when Kroger announced it would no longer sell gun periodicals that included content about assault-style rifles. L.L.Bean also announced it would end sales of guns to anyone under 21 years old. In response, several lawsuits were filed against Dick's and Walmart claiming age discrimination.
In the wake of boycott, Dick's first quarter net income increased to $60.1 million compared to $58.2 million for the same quarter the previous year, and sales were up by 4.6%. The results suggest that threats of a boycott against Dick's have not had the intended effect and that the company's policy change has had a positive business impact. This trend reversed in the second quarter. The decline was blamed in part on new firearms sales policies adopted after the Parkland, FL school shooting.
Publix.
National grocery retailer Publix suspended all political donations after Stoneman Douglas survivor David Hogg organized a "die in" and a public boycott to protest the company's support of Adam Putnam, an NRA-backed candidate for Florida governor. The NRA had labeled Putnam with its highest endorsement and Putnam called himself on Twitter a "proud NRA sellout." Hogg stated "Anyone who supports an NRA sellout is an NRA sellout," as the reason for the action. Prior to the in store protests Hogg called on Publix to donate $1 million to the Stoneman Douglas Victims fund.
Response.
In a statement released February 24, 2018, the NRA accused the companies involved in the boycott of “a shameful display of political and civic cowardice” and added, “Let it be absolutely clear. The loss of a discount will neither scare nor distract one single NRA member from our mission to stand and defend the individual freedoms that have always made America the greatest nation in the world.”
Following the NRA's response, conservative commentators and gun rights supporters voiced opposition to the boycott, calling it "mob justice" and accusing supporters of silencing free speech. Tim Hentschel of HotelPlanner.com said he would not mix business and politics, and that his decision to maintain the company's relationship with the NRA was not based on money.
Republicans in the Georgia state Senate voted to remove $50 million in jet fuel tax sale exemptions from a tax bill in response to Delta Air Lines' decision to sever ties with the NRA. Republican Lieutenant Governor Casey Cagle tweeted "I will kill any tax legislation that benefits @Delta unless the company changes its position and fully reinstates its relationship with @NRA. Corporations cannot attack conservatives and expect us not to fight back." Delta CEO Ed Bastian responded, saying, "Our decision was not made for economic gain and our values are not for sale."

The Commercial, Herne Hill

The Commercial (also known as The Commercial Hotel) is a public house at 210-212 Railton Road, Herne Hill, London. It is cited in 'The CAMRA Regional Inventory for London' as being one of only 133 pubs in Greater London with a pub interior of special historic interest, most notably for its, "Original counters, bar-back, fireplaces and much fielded wall panelling" dating from the 1930s. In July 2016, Lambeth Council designated The Commercial as a locally-listed heritage asset of architectural or historic interest, being described as a, "Two-storey Neo Georgian style inter-war pub with a three-part convex façade which follows the curve of the building line".
History.
The history of The Commercial dates from development of the area around Herne Hill railway station, which opened in 1862. The 1870 Ordnance Survey Map shows a cluster of new commercial development around the front of the railway station captioned ‘Commercial Place’, although the first direct reference to 'The Commercial Hotel' as licensed premises dates to 1876. An ""Important Notice" in the South London Chronicle on 6 September 1876 states that, "F. Mole, Family Wine and Spirit Merchant, Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill Station, Dulwich Begs inform Commercial Travellers and the public generally that he has the Choicest Selection wines and spirits, bottled ales and stout"". There is no record of The Commercial ever operating as an actual 'hotel', so it seems likely that this was added to give the pub status.
On 28 February 1880, the South London Press reports a court summons for disgraceful conduct for James Early, who acted in a disorderly manner and refused to leave The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, when requested to do so by Mr. Sparrowhawk, the manager. The 1881 Census records five people residing at The Commercial - the licensed victualler, Elizabeth Davies, the manager, John Sparrowhawk, and a barmaid, general servant, and potman. The Post Office Directory lists the publicans of The Commercial Hotel variously as Mrs. E. Davies in 1878, W. Cobley in 1896, Samuel Shott Death in 1904, and Clarke, Baker and Co. Ltd in 1944.
The 1881 Census also shows William Cobley as running the Ship York Tavern in Rotherhithe, but by the time of the 1891 Census, he is shown as living with his wife Sarah at The Commercial. The Proceedings of the Old Bailey show William Cobley of The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, and his son Earnest William Cobley, giving evidence concerning a burglary at the pub by Robert Williams and John Tucker on 13 November 1893. The scene is described by Earnest, ""On 17th October I went to bed about 12.45, after fastening up the house in con—junction with my dad—I came down about 7.40 a.m., and found the place in disorder, and a glass had been used for port wine — I saw the prisoners in the bar the night before". Both defendants were found guilty and sentenced to hard labour. A report of the local Conservative Ball in February 1889, states that members and their friends afterwards dined at The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, hosted by Cobley.
The rural environs of pub in the latter part of the 19th Century, are indicated by a Sporting Life report in March 1889 of The Surrey Fox Terrier and Rabbit Coursing Club adjourning to The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, "where the stakes were paid over, and with musical evening".
A case of counterfeit coinage is reported in September 1908 concerning Joseph Coombs, general dealer, who in company with his friend Boon, entered The Commercial Hotel, Herne Hill, where Boon put down a bad florin payment for drinks, which was immediately recognised by David Torr, a barman at the house, as counterfeit.
A 1912 photograph from the Lambeth Council Archives shows the name 'W. Colmer' displayed above the entrance to The Commercial Hotel, and a sign proclaiming "Bass on draught and in bottles"". At the Lambeth Police Court on 19 December 1918, William Colmer, licensee of the Commercial Hotel, was summoned for refusing to sell certain whisky to a person duly authorised by the Lambeth Food Control Committee. On a second summons the defendant was proceeded against for serving whisky without having a label on the bottle from which it was served, stating the strength and maximum price.
A 1921 photograph taken looking down Railton Road, with Herne Hill railway station on the right, shows a large sign advertising bottled Worthington beer on the side of The Commercial pub.
In 1936, the pub is shown in the Burton upon Trent Bass Museum archive, as being a Licensed House of Wenlock Brewery Co. Ltd of Shoreditch. The current frontage and historic interior of the pub dates from its enlargement in 1938 to incorporate number 210 Railton Road. The Commercial is one of at least 5,000 pubs which were built or rebuilt by breweries in England during the inter-war years.
For a number of years in the 1970s and 1980s, The Commercial was noteworthy for its association with London Welsh RFC, who met in the pub, and the lounge bar was filled with at least 70 framed rugby shirts, ties and photos donated by leading London Welsh players, including Welsh international and TV commentator, John Taylor.
The saloon and public bar of the pub were joined together in 2005. Whilst parts of the 1930s fielded wood panelling have been unsympathetically painted, the pub retains its fireplaces, bar-back (extending to the ceiling), bar and counter with round corner, and a rare example of a black and white chequered gutter ('spittoon trough') in the saloon. The Commercial continues to be a fine London example of an improved inter-war pub (rebuilt by breweries to increase size and appeal more to families and particularly women), of which increasingly few remain. The pub front is faience (now painted), which is also typical of the period. A blocked external doorway between the two sides of the pub may indicate a former off sales.
The Commercial in popular culture.
The Commercial in Herne Hill is cited as an influence by author John Ashton for his 2007 novel 'Dinner with Mandelson'.
In the 2018 book 'Today South London, Tomorrow South London', The Commercial is visited by the protagonists Dulwich Raider, Dirty South, Half-Life, and Cousin Max, where they sit outside and ""survey the piazza".
Recent history.
The Commercial was named as South East London CAMRA 'Pub of the Season' in winter 2008/09. The pub also holds the Cask Marque Award for serving great quality real ale. It also runs a popular Monday evening quiz night.
The Commercial closed for a major refurbishment in February 2017, officially dropping the word 'Hotel' from its name when reopening a few weeks later. It is currently owned by Mitchells and Butlers, and includes a small beer garden at the back. It is listed by Mitchells and Butlers as one of its 'Castle' brand pubs, "decidedly individual, with a character to suit its community"". The Commercial is also included in CAMRA's Good Beer Guide 2018.
The Commercial pub also features in a print celebrating Herne Hill's historic pubs, displayed on lamppost banners in the local area.

P. B. Abercrombie

Patricia Abercrombie Barnes (20 July 1917 – 7 May 2003), better known by the pen name P. B. Abercrombie, was a British writer.
Biography.
Patricia Abercrombie was born on 20 July 1917 in Hambledon, Surrey. Her father, Charles Murray Abercrombie, was a stockbroker who was serving in the British Army on the Western Front at the time of her birth. Her father came from a large family and among her uncles were the writer Lascelles Abercrombie and the town planner Patrick Abercrombie. Her mother died when she was 15 and her father two years later. She learned shorthand and typing and, at the age on nineteen, moved to London, where she married Denis Charles Barnes, a civil servant, in 1938. He was also a industrial relations expert, and wrote books.
Denis Barnes became the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Labour in 1966 and was knighted in 1967. He died on 6 May 1991. She died on 7 May 2003 in Tenterden. She and her husband are buried in Wittersham in Kent.
Works.
She began writing short stories on lunch breaks while working at the Ministry of Labour during World War Two. Her first novel, "The Rescuers", was published in 1952. Reviewing it in the "Daily Telegraph", John Betjeman wrote, "It abounds with subtle observation of psychological nuances, with illuminating remarks on human behaviour," and Marghanita Laski said that "It is written with delicacy and intelligence." Following the publication of her third novel, "Victor and the Vanquished", Angus Wilson wrote that "Miss Abercrombie is, in my opinion, the most interesting of our young novelists."
Her most critically and commercially successful novel was "A Little Difference", a comedy involving an adulterous teacher in an eccentric all-girls school. The "Tatler's" reviewer found it "As enjoyable as a glass of champagne in the middle of a sunny morning when you ought to be working." Infidelity played a role in her fifth novel, "Fido Couchant", about the comic but rocky progress of two marriages. Her sixth novel, "Pity", centered on a child kidnapping. "The Times"' reviewer found that "Miss Abercrombie gets some good touches but her setting and style are not always convincing." Her last book, "The Brou Ha-Ha", was an epistolary novel and returned to a comic theme, but by the time of its publication in 1972, one writer had already asked, "Whatever happened to P. B. Abercrombie...?" She appears to have stopped writing after "The Brou Ha-Ha".

Obscuro Barroco

Obscuro Barroco is a documentary film, directed by Evangelia Kranioti and released in 2018. A Greek and French coproduction, the film profiles Luana Muniz, a Brazilian transgender activist.
Summary.
Obscuro Barroco is an object that transforms infinitely, that devours infinitely: it is the mouth of Luana Muniz, a legendary figure of Rio de Janeiro’s night that serves as the stolen point of entry to the city's nocturnal incandescence.
The film opens with a seductive ballet of luxuriant tropical vegetation caught in the sea breeze and bowing under heavy rain drops. The theatrical beauty of these evergreen trees is so intense that it appears to border upon the artificial: these images set the stage for a reversal of perspective in which nature itself seems factitious. It will reappear in the glittering décor of a carnival float, the swirling gateway to an artificial paradise that a healer blows in our face. It is our very capacity for metempsychosis that plays out in this film, this strange and unknown faculty through which our soul can move towards, through and inside other bodies. A true question of cinema, then.
Obscuro Barroco is a docufiction about the dizzying heights of gender and metamorphosis. It is also a cinematographic hommage to a land of extremes, the city of Rio de Janeiro. Following the path of iconic transsexual figure Luana Muniz (1961-2017), the film explores different quests for the self through transvestism, carnaval and political struggle. In turn, it asks questions about the desire for transformation of the body, both intimate and social.
The film had its theatrical premiere at the 2018 Berlin International Film Festival, where it won a Jury Award from the Teddy Award program.

<doc id="56676665" url="?curid=56676665" title="Noderabō">
Noderabō

The noderabō is a Japanese yōkai from Toriyama Sekien's "Gazu Hyakki Yagyō" and is thought to be a yōkai that appears at abandoned temples.
The "Gazu Hyakki Yagyō" depicts a yōkai that looks like a monk wearing a tattered kasa standing next to a temple bell, but there is no explanation from Sekien about what this is about, so it is not known what characteristics this yōkai was intended to have.
Beginning in the Shōwa period, literature about yōkai often explained that they are a yōkai that appear at deserted dilapidated temples or that they are resulting the grudges turned yōkai of a chief priest whose temple became dilapidated from lack of donations from villagers, which would then appear at evenings at the dilapidated temple and ring the bell alone at the deserted temple.
Analysis.
As it is not clear what Sekien drew here, starting from the Heisei period, several hypotheses have been put forth, and one of them supposes that this is an original creation from Sekien that was made to satirize the Edo Period monks who broke their precepts. In modern times, pictures and tales in a similar mold that depict priests who broke their precepts out of an attachment to greed and lust and thus became yōkai can be often be found, and examples of these can often be found in publications near Sekien's time.
In the writings of the comic artist Mizuki Shigeru, there is a statement about the noderabō that when children would hear the sound of a bell in the mountains despite there being no temple, they were told that "it's because of the noderabō," but actually it was because of the mountain, and a phenomenon like yamabiko had occurred.
Also, in Niiza, Saitama Prefecture, there is a place called "Nodera," and there was once a man who tried to menace the residents of a village, so he tried to steal a nearby famous bell when a traveler happened to pass by, in a panic, he hid himself at a pond, and as a result he lost sight of the bell. This lake came to be called the Kanegabuchi (鐘ヶ渕, "bell abyss"), and it is also said that once a young monk disregarded a task asked for by the chief priest and instead played with the children, and in gloom from feeling unable to meet face-to-face with the priest, went into the pond water, and ever since then, a cry from the pond can be heard every evening. It is also surmised that Sekien could have drawn this yōkai called noderabō based on the place names Nodera and Kanegabuchi.
However, as for what exactly Sekien based this noderabō drawing on, considering the general tendency of all the yōkai included in the "Gazu Hyakki Yagyō" and the meagerness of the information shown in the drawings, there is very little material that can serve as evidence for any conclusion.

Avalum Naanum

Avalum Naanum () is a Tamil-language family soap opera starring Mounika Devi in a dual role opposite Amruth and Dharish, and is directed by Dhanush.

Synopsis.
Nila and Diya (Mounika Devi) are identical twin sisters. Nila's parents try to force her to marry Praveen (Amruth) because he comes from a wealthy family even though they know Nila loves Vijay (Shri Mahadev) and wants to focus on her career. On her wedding day, she leaves a note for her father and leaves for Pondicherry to be with Vijay. Diya's father, Sathyamoorthy (Supergood Kannan), forces Diya to pretend to be Nila and marry Praveen for the sake of the family's reputation. After the wedding ceremony is over, Diya's boyfriend Aravind (Dharish) comes as a guest and discovers the twin switch.

Bernard de la Salle

Bernard de la Salle, was a French mercenary captain during the Hundred Years War.
His story is mentioned in the Chronicles of Froissart
At the beginning of his career, in 1359, Bernard de la Salle, also known as Bernardon de la Salle, was in the service of Jean de Grailly Captal de Buch. On Monday 18 November 1359 he climbed the castle of Clermont-en-Beauvaisis with steel grabs.
However, after the Treaty of Brétigny (1360) He and his men found themselves unemployed and so become one of the 30 or so, so-called Tard-Venus bandits. that ranged the French country side pillaging towns.
In 1368, he is still in France with Bérard d'Albret, Gaillard de la Motte, Bernard d'Eauze and Bour de Badefol.
In 1369, along with Bernard de Wisk and Hortingo de la Salle, he captured Belleperche Castle, where Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon) lived. The castle was, however, besieged by the troops of the Dukes of Bourbon and Burgundy. The Duke of Bourbon was her son, and Frossart tells us that the siege redoubt he organized was "as strong and as well fortified as a good town might have been". The "Free companies" in the castle were expelled, but they took the duchess with them as hostage.
Isabella was also mother-in-law of King Charles V of France, and remained a prisoner of Bernard de la Salle until 1372, when the king arranged for the ransom to be paid.

Tesso

Tesso (鉄鼠) is a Japanese yōkai related to the vengeful spirit (onryō) of the Heian period monk Raigō and a mouse. The name "tesso" is a name given by Toriyama Sekien in the Edo period collection of yōkai pictures, the "Gazu Hyakki Yagyō", and this yōkai can also be called the Raigo-derived name Raigō-nezumi (頼豪鼠) as from the "Enkyōhon" (延慶本, alternatively read "Enkeihon"), a yomihon version of the "Heike Monogatari", or Mii-dera-nezumi (三井寺鼠) derived from Mii-dera in Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture as in the Edo period yōkai themed kyōka picture book, the "Kyōka Hyaku Monogatari". They became known starting in the Heisei period from its adoption in the mystery novel "Tesso no Ori" (The Tesso's Cage) by Natsuhiko Kyogoku.
Story.
Heike Monogatari.
According to the "Heike Monogatari", in the Heian period, Raigō, on the basis of a promise with Emperor Shirakawa of receiving as much reward as desired if it had effect, continuously prayed for the birth of the emperor's crown prince, and in 1074 (in the Jōhō years) on December 16, it was finally succeeded. As a reward, Raigō requested for the construction of an ordination platform (kaidan) building for Mii-dera, but opposition forces from Enryaku-ji at Mount Hiei obstructed this and prevented it from being granted.
In resentment, Raigō then proceeded to make prayers to drag the crown prince who was born from his prayers, Prince Atsufumi, down to the clutches of evil, and went into a fast. After 100 days, Raigō ended up looking like an evil ogre and died, and starting since then, an ominous white-haired old priest would appear by Prince Atsufumi's pillowside. Emperor Shirakawa was fearful of Raigō's curse and grasped around for prayers, but they had no effect, and Prince Atsufumi died barely at the age of 4.
In the yomihon versions of the "Heike Monogatari" such as "Enkyōhon" (延慶本, alternatively read "Enkeihon") and "Nagatohon" (長門本) and in the different book "Genpei Jōsuiki", among other sources, the grudges of Raigō became a giant rat and ate away at the sacred books in Enryaku-ji. Enryaku-ji was fearful of Raigō's grudge and built a shrine at Higashisakamoto to enshrine Raigō as a god in order to quell this grudge. The name of the shrine has been passed down to be "Nezumi no Hokura" (鼠の秀倉, The Rat Shrine). It is also said that after this, large rats have been called "Raigo-nezumi."
Taiheiki.
According to the military chronicle (Gunki monogatari) "Taiheiki", the grudges of Raigō turned into 84,000 rats with stone bodies and metal teeth and climbed up Mount Hiei and ate away at not just the sacred texts, but also the Buddha statues.
Raigō Ajari Kaisoden.
In the late Edo Period, the yomihon author Takizawa Bakin wrote "Raigō Ajari Kaisoden" (頼豪阿闍梨恠鼠伝) based on the Raigō legend. While the elegant Shimizu Yoshitaka (水義高, also known as Minamoto no Yoshitaka or 源義高), the orphan of Kiso no Yoshinaka was traveling across several provinces, Raigō appeared to her in a dream and talked about how because Yoshinaka once contributed a request form to Raigō's mini shrine (hokora) to become Seii Taishōgun, so he will offer his help to Yoshinaka, and told her about how Nekoma Michizane has been targeting her life due to having a grudge against her, and instructed Yoshinaka on some rat sorcerery.
In the story, the scene when Mitsuzane tried to cut down Yoshinaka and a giant rat appeared and stopped this, the scene when Yoshinaka called out an eerie person with the face of a rat in order to lure out her father's enemy Ishida Tamehisa, and the scene when Yoshinaka stopped Michizane's torture of her mother-in-law by summoning countless rats, among other scenes, were all given illustrations by the ukiyo-e artist Katsushika Hokusai.
Historical background.
In history, Raigō died in 1084 and Prince Atsufumi died in 1077, meaning that Raigō's death comes after Prince Atsufumi died, which is not consistent with the story, leading many specialists to posit that this legend is clearly made-up fiction.
However, certain parts, such as Mii-dera's request to the emperor for the construction of an ordination platform building, the prolonged declining of this request due to opposition from Enryaku-ji, and Raigō's efforts at getting this ordination platform building built, are seen as historical fact. Furthermore, according to the "Jimon Denki Horoku" (寺門伝記補録), the temple records of Mii-dera, as a result of the imperial court not approving the request to the emperor to build the ordination platform building, Raigō fell into gloom and did not leave the temple, resulting in a great rumble at the Shinra shrine at Mii-dera. Both Mii-dera and Enryaku-ji were in the Tendai sect, and after the death of the founder of the sect, Saichō, the sect split into two factions that engaged in violent disputes, and Enryaku-ji has had a history of being burned down several times as a result, so it is thought that this Tesso legend was born from the background of the confrontation between the two factions of the Tendai sect at that time.
Furthermore, stories in which not just metal rats (tesso), but also rats in general cause harm to people can be found in the Tōhoku region, the Nagano Prefecture, and other places all over Japan, but this is interpreted to be because in the past, rats did cause a lot of harm, and temples that held many books and sacred texts had some serious problems with rats causing damage, so there is the view that the existence of rats became the basis for legends about vengeful spirits and yōkai.
Landmarks.
The "Nezumi no Hokura" noted in the "Heike Monogatari" to be for calming the vengeful spirit of Raigō exists at the Hiyoshi Taisha in Sakamoto, Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture. However the "Keizai Zasshisha" (神道秘密記) written in the Azuchi–Momoyama period at the Hiyoshi Taisha notes that the "Nezumi no Hokura" enshrines the Rat of the Twelve Earthly Branches. The way the Nezumi no Hokura is talked about in relation to Raigō is seen to be because as previously noted, rats were actually a source of misfortune bringing harm to people, or because Enryaku-ji was in the kimon (demon's gate) direction from Kyoto resulting in a lot of sorcerery activity in the past and Hiyoshi Taisha is there to protect against that, leading to legends about neutralizing vengeful spirits to take root.
It appears that the Nezumi no Hokura had already become famous by the Kamakura period, and in the "Isetsu Hishō Kuden no Maki" published in 1319 (in the Gen'ō era), there is the lyrics "At the base of Wagatatsusoma (meaning Mount Hiei) is a rat god, and by sounding its name once again, maybe it'll bring forth some good fortune" (さればや我立杣の麓にも鼠神といははれ給ひて、其名をあらたにとどめき、様々の奇瑞をなせりとか) and in the renga collection Tsukubashū compiled in the Nanboku-chō period, there are renga based on the Raigō legend such as "this is the rat around the mountain base" (塵にまじはる鼠とこそあれ) and "at our mountain, it is one of the gods worshipped" (我山にこれもあがむる神のうち), among others. Originally, this hokura (shrine) was told to be bringing benefit by warding off rats, but starting in the Shōwa and Heisei periods when anti-rat measures have started to become sufficient, it has gradually lost its role of warding off rats.
The Jūhachi Myōjin (十八明神) to the side of the stone steps at Mii-dera is also called "Nezumi no Miya" (Rat Palace), and it is said to pacify the spirit of the Tesso and others, and it is built facing the direction of Mount Hiei.
Another idea is that the Tesso was slain by a big cat who appeared because of the Buddhist power of a high priest at Mount Hiei, and towards the "Nezumi no Miya" at Mii-dera, there is the "Neko no Miya" (Cat Palace) deifying the big cat at Sakamoto in Sakamotogō, Shiga District, Ōmi Province, known to be the town in front of the Enryaku-ji gates, where it is built glaring in the direction of Mii-dera.
In a legend in Shimotsuke Province (now Tochigi Prefecture), it is told that 84,000 rats went around several provinces ravaging the fields, but when the rats tried to attack Shimotsuke, Shōgun Jizō (勝軍地蔵, general jizō) appeared and stopped this, and sealed them in a mound. According to "Oyama no Densetsu" (Legends of Oyama) by the Oyama City Area Cultural Research Society (小山市郷土文化研究会), this mount is the Atagozuka (愛宕塚) in Dotō, Oyama, and another name for it is "Raisozuka" (来鼠塚, Come Rat Mound) and it is said that within it is a cave where rats were sealed inside. It is also said that by taking a rock from on top of this mound and leaving it in a field, it can avoid any harm due to rats.

1854 Cape Colony parliamentary election

The first election for the Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope were held in 1854. There were no clear party lines, however many representatives for Eastern electoral districts subscribed to a common programme which emphasised separation from the Cape Colony or moving the seat of colonial government eastward, a vagrancy law, or increasing the property qualification part of the franchise (which would have reduced the number of non-Whites able to vote).
Electoral system.
Voting system.
The election was conducted on the basis of the multi-racial Cape Qualified Franchise: Cape residents qualified as voters based on a universal minimum level of property ownership, regardless of race.
Elections to the upper house, the Cape Legislative Council, were conducted under a cumulative voting electoral system. This gave each voter several votes, which they could give to a single candidate, or split amongst several. This was justified by the "Report from a Committee of the Board of Trade and Plantations" on the basis that it would prevent any single group gaining a monopoly on power, as a minority voting in unison could ensure the return of their preferred candidate. The Cape Colony population at the time was majority Boer, with British settlers forming a minority. The British Government had pushed for the franchise property qualification to be low, thereby extending the franchise to the non-white population, who it was believed were more likely to side with the British than the Boers.
The population for the colony was estimated at 225,000 in 1853, with blacks outnumbering whites by a ratio of 55:45. The ratio of registered voters however was heavily in favour of whites.
Constituencies.
For elections to the House of Assembly, the Cape was divided into 22 electoral divisions, returning a total of 46 members. The electoral division boundaries corresponded with the existing Cape Colony fiscal divisions. The only exceptions to this were for Albany, and the urban areas of Cape Town-Green Point and Grahamstown, (which were not included in the Cape electoral division), which had their own electoral divisions.

On 31 January 2019, he was loaned to Shrewsbury for the remainder of the EFL League One season. He made his debut two days later in a 3–0 home loss to Luton Town, in which he started and was substituted for Stefan Payne after 63 minutes. He scored his first league goal on 16 February, opening a 1–1 home draw with Burton Albion. Campbell played 15 times for the Shrews, scoring five goals helping them to secure League One safety. Campbell's performances for Shrewsbury earned him the EFL Young Player of the Month award for February 2019.
Campbell scored his first Championship goal on 19 October 2019 in a 2–0 win against Fulham. Campbell struggled to make an impact under Nathan Jones being mainly used as a substitute. Following the arrival of Michael O'Neill in November 2019, Campbell eventually worked his way back into the side and scored vital goals against Sheffield Wednesday, Huddersfield Town and West Bromwich Albion helping Stoke move out the relegation zone at the turn of the new year. Campbell signed a new four-and-a-half-year contract with Stoke on 24 January 2020, after turning down offers from a number of other clubs. The season extended into June due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Campbell played in all the remaining matches and scored twice against relegation rivals Barnsley on 4 July 2020. He ended the campaign with nine goals from 37 appearances as Stoke avoided relegation and finished in 15th position.
Campbell began the 2020–21 season in good form, scoring the winning goal against Brentford on 24 October 2020, and scoring twice in a 4–3 victory against Huddersfield Town on 21 November. By the beginning of December, he had scored seven goals and provided five assists in 19 appearances. However, he suffered a season-ending knee injury against Cardiff City on 8 December.
International career.
Having previously represented England at U16 and U17 level, Campbell received his first call-up for the U20 squad on 8 November 2019. Campbell scored twice in a 4–0 victory over Portugal in the U20 Elite League on 14 November 2019.

Echelons of Fury

Echelons of Fury is an out-of-print collectible card game by Medallion Simulations. It was released in May 1995 alongside Echelons of Fire. The "First Edition" set had at least 70 cards though some sources claim 57 cards. It had two other expansions, one released in October 1995, called "Second Edition" and it contained at least 95 cards; the second expansion was called "Pacific Campaign" and it contained at least 105 cards. The Second Edition was believed to have unannounced cards in the set as well and one card suspected as missing called "U.S. M-26 Pershing". Both the First and Second editions had incomplete card lists supplied by the manufacturer. A future expansion called "Echelons Freedom Fighters" was scheduled for 2002 but never materialized. Other expansions were announced including a Russian front, as well as a modern-day war against North Korea, but they too were never released.
The game was based on the World War II between the Americans and the Germans. The game was considered "hard to pick up" due to the "dense rulebook" and its rules were compared to miniature wargaming. The "Pacific Campaign" expansion adapted the war versus Japan with cards geared toward island war. The Allied player had to land their craft onto shore, while the Japanese player had to respond with counters via bombers and booby traps.
Allen Varney reviewed the game as a "worse clone" of "".

<doc id="56676858" url="?curid=56676858" title="Lake Chouteau">
Lake Chouteau

Lake Chouteau was a glacial lake formed during the late Pleistocene along the Teton River. After the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, water melting off the glacier accumulated between the Rocky Mountains and the ice sheet. The lake drained along the front of the ice sheet, eastward towards the Judith River and the Missouri River.
The maximum advance of the Laurentide Ice Sheet blocked the drainages of north- and east-flowing rivers, forming glacial lakes along the margin of the ice. On the western Montana plains the Shelby lobe blocked the [Milk River, creating glacial Lake Twin River. Tributaries of the Marias River were also blocked by the Shelby lobe, leading to the formation of glacial lakes Cutbank and Choteau. The Loma sublobe blocked the Missouri north of the Highwood Mountains, forming glacial Lake Great Falls. A lake also formed in the Musselshell River basin.
Identification.
Scattered limestone boulders and cobbles sitting on bedrock with in the Teton River basin, east of the river outlet from the piedmont glacial lobe and west of Choteau is evidence of several pre-Pinedale piedmont glaciations. The clasts made up of boulders and cobbles from the limestone-rich, mountain-source and is a nonglacial alluvium of Tertiary age that formerly covered the bedrock surfaces.
Paleosols identified as part of the Bull Lake till units or outwash units are weakly developed. They represent two stades of a single glaciation. They are dated from the early Bull Lake lateral moraines in the Glacier National Park at approximately 160 thousand years before present (YBP), the late Bull Lake lateral moraines are approximately 140 thousand YBP.

Simon Jacques Rochard

Simon Jacques Rochard (28 December 1788 – 10 June 1872) was a painter of portrait miniatures in France, England and Brussels in the first half of the nineteenth century.
He was born in Paris to René Rochard and Marie Madeleine Talon. He showed early talent and, after his father died, helped support his mother and eleven siblings by drawing portraits. Rochard studied under Étienne Aubry and at the École des Beaux-Arts. He also studied miniature-painting from Emilie Bounieu (daughter of Michel Honoré Bounieu). At only twenty he painted a portrait of the Empress Joséphine for Napoleon and later other portraits of the imperial family.
After Napoleon's return from Elba in 1815, he was drafted into the army but deserted and went to Brussels. There he received commissions to paint miniatures including at least one of the Duke of Wellington leader of the forces opposing Napoleon. Shortly after he moved to London and became very popular, painting numerous miniatures of members of the upper class such as Princess Charlotte. He exhibited mostly at the Royal Academy of Arts from 1816 to 1845.
In 1846, he moved to Brussels where he exhibited at the Salon there until 1869. He also exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1852 and the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris. He died in 1872.
Marriage and family.
His first marriage to Henriette Petitjean ended in a separation but left Rochard with a daughter, Eugenie, born in 1814, who married an English officer. At the age of 80 (circa 1868) he married Henriette Pilton, by whom he had one son. (However his son, Jean Simon Rochard, was apparently born before 1856.)
His younger brother, François Theodore Rochard (1798–1857), joined him in London around 1820. He was also a popular portrait painter specializing in miniatures and in water colors and won two silver medals from the new Society of British Artists in 1823. He retired after his marriage in 1850 and died on 31 October 1857 in London.

Astrobrachion constrictum

Astrobrachion constrictum is a basket star in the family Euryalidae. It is mostly found at depths of between , but around the coast of New Zealand it occurs in shallow waters, in association with the black coral "Antipathella fiordensis".
Description.
"A. constrictum" has a central disc growing to a maximum diameter of , and five slender arms which may reach a length of . The genus is characterised by the lateral arm plates being separated by small ventral plates. The colour is variable, ranging from yellowish-white to red, and the arms have transverse banding. "Astrobrachion adhaerens", the only other species in the genus, is smaller and has longitudinal stripes on the arms.
Distribution.
The species is endemic to New Zealand and southeastern Australia, and normally occurs at depths of between . These depths are too deep for most scuba divers, which makes it difficult to study these basket stars. However, in the Fiordland in the south-western part of the South Island of New Zealand, unique conditions allow them and their black coral hosts to live in shallower waters where they are within the range of divers and more readily studied.
Ecology.
Black corals in the genus "Antipathella" host "A. constrictum" in a mutualistic association that seems to be a long-lasting arrangement: the basket stars coil their arms around the coral twigs and remain in the same locality for long periods, and possibly for life. The basket star has been found in a number of locations around New Zealand on the continental shelf but has never been found living freely, or living anywhere except in association with a black coral colony. The basket stars feed at night, uncoiling their arms from the coral and catching organic particles floating past. They also brush their arms against the coral surface and are probably feeding on detritus and any epizoic organisms that settle there. They are slow-growing, reaching their maximum size at approximately eight years of age.

Cuba and the Cameraman

Cuba and the Cameraman is a 2017 American documentary film written, directed and co-produced by Jon Alpert. The film is a Netflix Original and was first shown at the 74th Venice International Film Festival.
Plot.
The film shows Cuba over a course of 45 years through the lens of Jon Alpert.
Production.
Alpert started visiting Cuba in the 70's. After founding the Downtown Community Television Center, he became increasingly interested in Cuba's policies. He said: "We heard that Fidel Castro was implementing the social programs that we were fighting for here in New York”. The film was edited from over 1,000 hours of footage, Alpert filmed since the first time he visited Cuba.
Reception.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 100% based on 7 reviews, with an average rating of 7.7/10. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 82 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "Universal acclaim". Glenn Kenny from The New York Times wrote: "In part because of its political blind spots, “Cuba and the Cameraman” is captivating. (Whatever you think of Mr. Alpert’s perspective, it’s interesting.) But it’s mostly worth watching because of human stories like these."
David Ehrlich from IndieWire gave the film a B+ and stated: "If only Alpert had been a bit less genial, if only he had dug a little deeper — if only he had either taken himself out of the equation, or gone the other way and been much more introspective about his complicated feelings about Castro — then “Cuba and the Cameraman” could have been more than just a window into a foreign world. But windows are important; without them, we’d never be able to see through our walls. And this is as clear and wide a window as you’re ever likely to find."
Sheri Linden from the Los Angeles Times said about the film: "As a decades-long, ground-level portrait of the country, his vibrant film is unprecedented." Neil Young from The Hollywood Reporter wrote: "A work of old-school humanism that hovers between pro-Revolutionary fervor and a more objective documentary stance, Cuba and the Cameraman is sustained by the strong bonds of trust which the gregarious Alpert has evidently been able to maintain with Cubans from various echelons of this theoretically classless society."

2018 San Diego City Council election

The 2018 San Diego City Council election occurred on November 6, 2018. The primary election was held June 5, 2018. Four of the nine seats of the San Diego City Council were contested.
Municipal elections in California are officially non-partisan, although most members do identify a party preference. A two-round system was used for the election, starting with a primary in June followed by a runoff in November between the top-two candidates in each district.
The election resulted in a net gain of one seat for self-identified Democrats. This gave Democrats a two-thirds majority on the City Council, allowing them to override vetoes by Republican Mayor Kevin Faulconer on issues that divide along partisan lines. Additionally two incumbent council members were defeated, marking the first time any incumbent had lost a City Council election in the city since 1992.
Campaign.
The even-numbered districts 2, 4, 6, and 8 were up for election in 2018. It was the first City Council election using the new rules that requires a runoff in November between the top-two candidates in the June primary whether or not any of the candidates get a majority of the vote.
Incumbents Lorie Zapf (District 2), Myrtle Cole (District 4), and Chris Cate (District 6) stood for reelection. David Alvarez (District 8) was ineligible to run due to term limits. Republicans were considered more vulnerable to lose seats in the election due to the two Republican-held seats, Districts 2 and 6, being considered swing districts while the two Democrat-held seats, Districts 4 and 8, were considered safe districts. However, incumbents historically had not lost reelection to the San Diego City Council, and both Zapf and Cate had raised far more money than their challengers as of February 2018.
Results.
District 2.
District 2 consisted of the communities of Bay Ho/Bay Park/Morena, Midway/North Bay, Mission Beach, Ocean Beach, Pacific Beach, and Point Loma. A large field of seven challengers qualified to run against incumbent council member Lorie Zapf. In the June primary, Zapf advanced to the general election to face retired doctor Jennifer Campbell. Campbell was elected to the City Council in the November general election, making Zapf one of the first incumbents on the City Council to lose a reelection bid since 1992.
District 4.
District 4 consisted of the communities of Alta Vista, Broadway Heights, Chollas View, Emerald Hills, Encanto, Greater Skyline Hills, Jamacha, Lincoln Park, Lomita Village, North Bay Terrace, Oak Park, O'Farrell, Paradise Hills, Redwood Village, Rolando Park, South Bay Terrace, Valencia Park, and Webster. Three challengers qualified to run against incumbent Council President Myrtle Cole, all from her own party. In the June primary, Cole advanced to the general election to face civil rights lawyer Monica Montgomery. Montgomery was elected to the City Council in the November general election, making Cole one of the first incumbents on the City Council to lose a reelection bid since 1992. This did not impact the partisan composition of the City Council since both Cole and Montgomery are Democrats.
District 6.
District 6 consisted of the communities of Clairemont Mesa, Kearny Mesa, Mira Mesa, Mission Valley, North Clairemont, and Rancho Peñasquitos. Five challengers qualified to run against incumbent council member Chris Cate. In the June primary, Cate advanced to the general election to face environmental advocate Tommy Hough. Cate was reelected in the November general election.
District 8.
District 8 consisted of the southern communities of San Diego and those along the Mexico–United States border, including the communities of Barrio Logan, Egger Highlands, Grant Hill, Logan Heights, Memorial, Nestor, Ocean View Hills, Otay Mesa West, Otay Mesa East, San Ysidro, Sherman Heights, Stockton, and Tijuana River Valley. Incumbent council member David Alvarez is ineligible to run due to term limits. Four candidates qualified to run for the open seat. In the June primary, Vivian Moreno, a political staffer in Alvarez's office, and Antonio Martinez, a community health clinic worker and member of the San Ysidro School District Board of Education, advanced to the general election. Moreno was then elected to the City Council in the November general election with a majority of the vote.
Council President.
On December 10, 2018, the new council was sworn in. For their first action, the council voted unanimously to appoint Georgette Gomez as council president.

Kessen wa Kinyōbi

 is a song recorded by Japanese band Dreams Come True for their fifth studio album, "The Swinging Star". It was released as the album's lead single by Epic/Sony Records on September 19, 1992. It served as the opening theme to the CX music show "Ureshi Tanoshi Daisuki - Friday Night Live", on which the band were regular cast members. The single's coupling song, "Taiyō ga Miteru" was used in the advertising campaign for Fujifilm's Fujicolor Super HG 400 film.
Composition.
The lyrics to "Kessen wa Kinyōbi" were written by Miwa Yoshida and the song was composed and arranged by Masato Nakamura, while the track was co-produced by the band and Mike Pela. "Kessen wa Kinyōbi" came about when Nakamura and Sing Like Talking frontman Chikuzen Satō decided to challenge themselves to a friendly competition to see who could write the best song using the chord progression to Cheryl Lynn's "Got to Be Real" as base inspiration. "Kessen wa Kinyōbi" and "Rise" by Sing Like Talking, from their album "Humanity" (1992), were the resulting tracks. Additionally, Nakamura pulled inspiration from Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's "Let's Groove" to make the perfect disco anthem. The song is written in the key of C minor with a common time tempo of 126 beats per minute. Yoshida's vocals span two octaves, from G3 to G5.
Critical reception.
CDJournal critics described the song as a "fanfare" that gets your "adrenaline pumping". It was praised for capturing the essence of Lynn's "Got to Be Real", on which the song is based.
Cover versions.
In 2003, Key of life and A.mia sampled "Kessen wa Kinyōbi" on their song "Friday Let Me Down" featuring Soul'd Out's Diggy-Mo'. In 2012, Nico Touches the Walls recorded a cover of the song to be included as a B-side to the single "Yume 1 Go". In 2014, HY recorded a cover of the song for the Dreams Come True tribute album, "Watashi no Dorikamu", released in celebration of the band's 25th anniversary. In 2017, Daichi Miura recorded his rendition of the song for the Dreams Come True cover album, "DoriUta Vol. 1".
Chart performance.
"Kessen wa Kinyōbi" debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, with 211,000 copies sold in its first week. The single stayed at the top of the chart for three consecutive weeks, selling 136,000 copies on its second charting week and 87,000 copies on its third week. It slid to number three the following week, logging sales of 88,000 units. The single spent an additional three weeks in the top ten. It charted in the top 100 for twenty-three weeks, selling a reported total of 1,070,000 copies, making it Dreams Come True's first million-selling single. "Kessen wa Kinyōbi" ranked at number 18 on the year-end Oricon Singles Chart for 1992.

Cleveland SC

Cleveland SC is an American amateur soccer club based in the Greater Cleveland, Ohio region. Cleveland competes in the National Premier Soccer League (NPSL) as part of the Midwest Region's Rust Belt Conference. The club was established on February 19, 2018, taking over from the recently defunct AFC Cleveland as the city's representative in the NPSL.
Samuel Seibert, a local Cleveland banker and administrator, founded the club after being approached by a group of former AFC Cleveland players who wanted to see competitive soccer retained in the Cleveland area. The club plays home matches at George Finnie Stadium in Berea, Ohio. During the club's first four seasons of existence, CSC played at Don Shula Stadium, Lakewood Stadium, Krenzler Field, and Sparky DiBiasio Stadium.
Cleveland has a rivalry with fellow Ohioan NPSL club FC Columbus, named the Cheese Barn Derby by supporters. Former professional players to have appeared for the club include Riley Grant and Ben Fitzpatrick, while Louie Rolko served as an assistant coach.
History.
For the previous six seasons, from 2012 to 2017, AFC Cleveland had represented the city of Cleveland in the National Premier Soccer League. That run had included an NPSL national championship in 2016, as well as two appearances in the U.S. Open Cup. However, the club was expelled from the NPSL due to "not [being] in good financial standing with the league." That announcement came on December 12, 2017, just months before the new NPSL season was set to begin.
Inaugural season.
The catalysts for founding Cleveland SC were two former AFC Cleveland players, Coletun Long and Chris Cvecko. According to Long, the two "started having a conversation in the car and talked further in a Chipotle parking lot outside the city. We wrote down ideas and called teammates and others previously associated with AFC Cleveland.” One of those people contacted was Samuel Seibert, a native of Northeast Ohio who had been on the media relations staff for AFC Cleveland. He would go on to take the lead on the NPSL expansion process, culminating in an official announcement of Cleveland SC as an NPSL expansion club on February 19, 2018. That announcement came just 90 days before the club was set to play its first regular season match.
Prior to the season beginning, CSC announced that the club would be playing its inaugural season at Don Shula Stadium, located in University Heights, Ohio on the campus of John Carroll University. In conjunction with local designers, a crest and kits featuring an orange and black color combination were launched in mid-March, less than a month before the club's inaugural match. Ryan Osborne was announced as the club's first head coach and the first two matches in club history took part in April, the inaugural edition of the Cheese Barn Derby against FC Columbus. The first-ever league match in CSC history took place on May 19, 2018, ending in a 2–0 victory over Rochester Lancers courtesy of goals from Declan McGivern and American futsal international Antonio Manfut. After a second-place finish in the Midwest-East, the club qualified for the playoffs and defeated Erie Commodores in the quarterfinals before falling to AFC Ann Arbor in the regional semifinals.
Stadium.
During the 2018 season, Cleveland SC played home matches at Don Shula Stadium, located in University Heights, Ohio on the campus of John Carroll University. The stadium has a capacity of 5,416, which made it the second-largest stadium in the Midwest-East behind only Marina Auto Stadium. Cleveland played its first match at Shula Stadium on May 19, 2018, defeating Rochester Lancers 2–0 in front of a crowd of a couple hundred. Cleveland finished with four wins, one draw, and one loss in home matches during its lone season at the stadium.
Due to renovation work at Shula Stadium over the summer of 2019, Cleveland moved to Baldwin Wallace University's George Finnie Stadium, located in Berea, Ohio. The 7,800 capacity stadium still holds the title of being the second-largest stadium in the Midwest-East, behind Marina Auto Stadium. Cleveland debuted at Finnie Stadium on May 5, 2019, with a 2-1 win an international friendly match against Monarcas Morelia Reserves.
Club culture.
Broadcasting.
Although the NPSL does not require clubs to stream matches, Cleveland SC streamed every home match in 2018 on Mycujoo. Vince McKee served as the main commentator for the duration of the season, while the color commentator role was filled by a rotating cast of analysts.
Rivalries.
Although the two clubs are in different conferences, Cleveland has a friendly rivalry with fellow Ohioan NPSL club FC Columbus. Both clubs were founded in 2018, and their inaugural matches came against each other in a home-and-home friendly series in April 2018. Supporters of the clubs dubbed the rivalry the Cheese Barn Derby, named after a landmark business that sits just off Interstate 71 in Ashland, Ohio. The actual barn is roughly equidistant between the cities of Cleveland and Columbus. In 2018, the first year of the rivalry, neither team was able to claim the Derby title: both Cleveland and Columbus won their away game 3–2, meaning the inaugural Cheese Barn Derby ended in a 5–5 tie.
Supporters.
The primary supporters' group for Cleveland SC is 6th City Syndicate, an "independent supporters' group for Cleveland soccer." 6CS is unaffiliated with the club, and as such also provides support for WPSL club Cleveland Ambassadors. Prior to the foundation of Cleveland SC, 6th City Syndicate had supported AFC Cleveland, migrating to the new club after AFC Cleveland folded in December 2017.

Ishq Subhan Allah

Ishq Subhan Allah (English: "Love, Oh My God") is an Indian television series that premiered on 14 March 2018 on Zee TV. Produced by Dheeraj Kumar, it starred Eisha Singh and Adnan Khan. Set against a Muslim backdrop, it addressed contemporary political, religious and social issues including Triple talaq and Sharia law and aimed to dispel wrong notions about Islam.
Plot.
The series begins with Zara Siddiqui and Kabir Ahmad returning to Lucknow after five years and completing higher studies in Islam. When an argument about Triple Talaq between Zara and Kabir becomes viral on the Internet, they are forced to marry each other.
Gradually after marriage, Zara realises her love for the still hesitant Kabir. Rukhsaar has been in love with him from a young age and tries to split them up, bringing Miraj to create differences between Zara and Kabir though he goes rogue out to harm everyone in the family.
Rukhsaar calls Nilofer to pose as Miraj's sister and instructs her to protect the family from Miraj except for Zara, but is then married off to Hamdan Alghazi and leaves for Dubai. Miraj buys out and kills Nilofer. A misunderstanding leads Kabir to divorce Zara using the Triple Talaq practice.
It is revealed this was not a part of their weddings, and Zara refuses to accept. Miraj tells Zara that he wants her and can go to any extent, whereas she tries to have Rukhsaar return to expose Miraj's true intentions but cannot reach her. Miraj makes his way into the local Shariah Board and turns out to be diamond-smuggler laundering money.
Miraj is arrested, and Kabir's dream project loses its funding. Miraj's connection to Rukhsaar is revealed before he swears revenge on Zara and Kabir, who confess their love. The family arrange their remarriage. Before it, Kabir leaves for Dubai to save Rukhsaar from implication in Hamdaan's death and ends up marrying her to save her. He weds Zara on his return. When Zara finds out, she is heartbroken but decides to stay.
Rukhsaar goes back to her evil scheming by feeding Zara false information about her and Kabir being intimate on their wedding night. Kabir then decides to divorce Rukhsaar, but cannot since Islam states that 'you cannot divorce your spouse without reason. Meanwhile, Rukhsaar shockingly agrees to sign the divorce papers, only on one condition. Kabir has to spend a night with her like he should've done on their nuptial night, which is part of her plan to separate Zara and Kabir by poisoning herself and Kabir. On Zara's orders, Kabir reluctantly agrees to Rukhsaar's condition. On their wedding night, Rukhsaar meets with an accident and loses her memory. Kabir takes responsibility for upsetting Zara. Wanting Kabir to earn independently, Zara moves to the outhouse. Tabassum visits with Azhar, who appreciates Zara's modern thinking. Shahbaz is in debt and decides to sell the house, but Kashan tricks him and takes ownership of the house.
Kabir realises Shahbaz's faults and sees Zara's well-intended suggestion to him to earn independently. Rukhsaar is sent to a hospital for treatment; Zeenat and Kashan team up to have Alina marry local don Salamat's son Samir. Zara and Kabir thwart their plan with the help of army officer Amir, who and Alina fall in love and marry. Salamat tries to kill Kabir and Zara. Kabir becomes the head priest.
Zeenat is irked; Salamat threatens to kill Rukhsaar, and Irfan suggests Zara become the vice priest. Heer's case is brought before the Sharia Board, where she wants to go to Delhi to study but in vain amid her reluctant father. Zara takes the case against Kabir and wins. Suraiya moves to Lucknow with Rizwan and plans to replace Kabir as Board Head with Zeenat's help. Salamat bribes Khalid at Zeenat's request.
Rizwan exposes Zeenat's actions as soon as he joins the Board and has her declared mentally unsound. She vows revenge on Rizwan, who starts poisoning Irfan slowly. Bilal and Kausar's case comes to the Board; Rizwan plans to create a rift between Zara and Kabir, who tells her that Kausar was betrothed to Kashan and eloped on the wedding before Kashan married Zeenat, who was indebted to Kausar's family.
Everyone in the family request Zara to disagree with the case, but she and Kabir decide. The entire city protests against them, and Kabir turns against Zara, who is about to drop the case before Kausar's suicide attempt changes her mind. Zara leaves Ahmads and Shahbaz plans her murder. In the Sharia Board, she wins. Rizwan orchestrates Kabir in an accident; a hitman hired by Shahbaz shoots Zara. The two collapse together.
One year later.
Zara and Kabir live separately. While Zara resides with Amina, Azra and Nusu in Mumbai, Kabir lives with his family in Lucknow. Zara and Kabir have applied for a divorce wanting to free each other, but he finds Zara's hospital reports and is shocked to discover that Zara was in a coma after being shot. Alina tries to bring them together, but they see through her plan.
Zara discovers that Kabir became a writer after publishing a book on their relationship and moves to Lucknow with Azra. They finally decide to give their relationship another chance angering Zeenat and Shahbaz. Shahbaz again tries to have her killed, but Kabir saves her every time.
The Ahmads rejoice at the couple's reunion prospect, and Kabir insults Irfan, asking the Qazi to beg him to take Zara back. Upset, Zara breaks up with Kabir, while Irfan has a heart attack. Ayesha is heartbroken and asks him to leave the house. He starts living in the mosque.
One month later.
Zara learns about Ayesha's illness from Kashan and decides to go back only for Ayesha's sake. She decides to reunite Ayesha and Kabir on Eid. Shahbaz and Zeenat worry that Zara and Kabir might get back together, so Shahbaz constantly provokes Kabir against Zara. According to the Sharia Board, all the board members should attend the Eid celebrations with their entire family.
Shahbaz tries to foil the plan, but Zara is the event organiser and manages the situation. Rukhsaar returns, and the family is unaware of it. Zara and Azra succeed in reuniting Kabir and Ayesha with Rukhsaar's help. Rukhsaar vows to reunite Kabir and Zara. Zara tried to find out who shot her on 12 April. Rizwan misleads her and tells her that he did not attack Kabeer purposely but was blackmailed by someone else. Rizwan begins to plan his revenge against Shahbaz and Kabeer. He plans to frame Shahbaz for Kabeer’s murder. During this time, Kabeer and Zara start working together at an NGO and go to a village to help save kids education. In the village, Shahbaz plans the explosion of the warehouse while Rizwan plans to put Zara and Kabeer inside the warehouse so that Shahbaz gets the blame for their death. Kabeer and Zara escape in time and come back to give Khula and separate. It is then revealed that Rukhsaar never intended to reunite Kabeer and Zara and instead plot to take revenge and ruin their lives. Rukhsaar, with the help of Rizwan, start planning and plotting against Zara and Kabir, but their plans constantly fail. Zain comes from Mumbai after saving Zara from being arrested (which was part of Rukshaar's plan to trouble Zara ), and Salma and Irfan plan his wedding to Zara. Kabir forbids them from informing Ayesha about Zara's upcoming wedding, while Zara tells Kabir to attend her wedding agree to her getting married before she does, which Kabir agrees to. While worsening her condition under the pretence of taking care of her, Rukhsaar's evil plans are discovered by Ayesha on Zara's wedding day. Still, before exposing her, Rukhsaar smothers Ayesha with a pillow and kills her. Ayesha's last rites are performed, Kabir agrees to Zara getting married, but Zara's wedding is cancelled.
With the help of Imran, Zara and Kabir discover Rizwan's plans and gets him arrested. Kabir then realises that his presence around Zara is not the reason for putting their lives in danger from previous events. He then goes to Irfan and Salma to ask for Zara's hand in marriage, which they agree to. Kabir takes Zara out on a date and proposes to Zara, but their happiness is short-lived as Shahbaz shoots and kills Zara on that same night. A truck runs over Zara's car and pushes it off a cliff, exploding, and Zara is declared dead.
One Year Later.
It has been a year since Zara's death. Kabir, who goes by the name of Johnny, lives in a mosque. He helps police officers in disabling bombs without protection, deliberately trying to get himself killed so that he can reunite with Zara. Salma is unwell and is hoping for Kabir to return soon. Rukhsaar rules the Ahmed house and is blackmailing Shahbaz using the evidence of Zara's death against him. It is later revealed that Rukhsaar was the one who got Zara's car run over, killing her in an explosion. While in the wild, Kabir saves a girl from thugs who coincidently have the name Zara.
On the day of Zara's first death anniversary, Kabir goes back to Lucknow to visit Zara's grave, next to Ayesha's. Back to where he was, Kabir sees Salma in a car with Azra looking unwell. He decides to follow them and finds out that Salma has been ill since Zara's departure.
Imran informs Shahbaz about Kabir's return, and Shahbaz asks Kabir to return home. Shahbaz is pleased with the return of his son. Rukhsar forces Shahbaz to ask Kabir to stay in Lucknow for 2 weeks in order to get closer to him. Kabir agrees, but does not want to have any relationship with Rukhsar. The girl Zara, who was saved by Kabir, travels to Lucknow to meet the children. She raised three children from their very childhood, but they were kidnapped by Abid Ali, Zara wants to help them and free them. Abid Ali offers friendship to Shahbaz, but he refuses, after the identity of Abid Ali is revealed and he is accused of child trafficking. Zara meets Qazi Irfan Siddiqui at the mosque. She tells him about the children, and that she does not have a home. Qazi Irfan Siddiqui invites her to his home, his wife and Azra warmly welcome the new Zara.
The question arises about the guardianship of children. Kabir and New Zara learn that the parents of two children have died, and the parents of the third child refused to return the child to the family. Kabir decides to marry Rukhsar in order to arrange custody of the children. The new Zara is not happy about this because she believes that she will be separated from her children, but Kabir hires the new Zara as a tutor to his house. New Zara and Kabir begin to draw closer, Kabir pays no attention to Rukhsar and completely ignores her. In his heart there are only memories of his Dawn. Rukhsar unites with Shahbaz and they plot against Kabir and the children. Rukhsar tries several times to kill the new Zara and the children, but she fails to do so.
Soon, New Zara will learn more about Zara, whom Kabir was married to, and is trying to find Zara's killer. New Zara learns the truth that Zara was killed by Shahbaz and tells Kabir about it. Kabir tries to kill his father Shahbaz, but he cannot do it for fear of Allah. Shahbaz and Kabir become bitter enemies. Shahbaz and Rukhsar take Kabir to a mental hospital, pretending to be insane. New Zara frees Kabir and tries to help him expose Shahbaz and Rukhsar. After it turns out that Rukhsar is also involved in the death of Zara. Shahbaz previously won elections and became a minister. A decision is made to resign Qazi Irfan Siddiqui and select a new Qazi Lucknow. There are two contenders: Kabir and Jalali. Jalali is a friend of Shahbaz, who unites with Shahbaz and Rukhsar and is plotting against New Zara and Kabir. Jalali is a respected person and has a large number of followers who consider him holy and close to Allah. Zara recognizes Jalali and tells Kabir that Jallali killed her parents by chopping off their heads and bringing them on a platter to little New Zara. New Zara still cannot forget this picture, she is afraid of Jalali. Kabir helps New Dawn to overcome fear and she wants to take revenge on Jalali. Before the elections, Jalali and Shahbaz kidnap members of the Shariah Council to prevent Kabir from becoming the new Qazi. Kabir and New Zara, disguised as drug dealers, go to Jalalpur, where the members of the Shariah Council were taken away. In the village they are exposed to the magic of Jalali and attacks by the genies, but they defeat Jalali and Kabir becomes the new Qazi of Lucknow. Also in the village of New, Zara met her brother Asim, who did not recognize her because he was a slave of Jalali who had been using opium in large quantities every day since leaving his sister. Kabiru and New Zara manage to convince Asim that New Zara is his sister and they take him with them to Lucknow. Jalali, Shahbaz and Asim are arrested in Lucknow. But Shahbaz and Jalali manage to free themselves. The new Zara realizes that she loves Kabir. Jalali, Shahbaz and Rukhsar want to remove Kabir from the post of Qazi and appoint Jalali to this position. Rukhsar conspires a plan against Kabir and declares in the Shariah Council that Kabir is not fulfilling his duties as a husband and is cheating on her with New Zara. New Zara confesses to the council that she loves Kabir. The council decides to remove Kabir from the Qazi post. Kabir decides to find a husband for New Zara within a month. The new Zara resists this and begs Kabir to marry her, but he refuses. As a result, Kabir finds the husband of New Zara and she leaves with him.
Production.
Development and premiere.
On 15 October 2017, During the telecast of Zee Rishtey Awards while celebrating its 25th anniversary, Zee TV unveiled its new logo and announced the show by releasing a teaser of this series under the title "Subhan Allah" along with other three shows under its new strapline "Aaj Likhenge Kal".
Before its premiere, it was titled as "Ishq Pakeezah" but was later changed to "Ishq Subhan Allah".
Deepak Rajadhyaksha, Deputy Business Head, Zee TV said, "We started 2018 with the launch of two beautifully curated shows, Aap Ke Aa Jane Se and Kaleerein each of which has touched upon a contemporary Indian reality and is sensitizing the masses about the same. Our next primetime fiction offering belongs to the Muslim social drama space that we had, ourselves, pioneered with Qubool Hai, a show that enjoyed an immensely successful run of two seasons. Ishq Subhan Allah asks viewers to pause and reflect on the true interpretation of religion in our daily lives. It questions the true importance we accord to a woman's choice in every decision that a couple makes, including entering the institution of marriage as also ending it with dignity".
Dheeraj Kumar, the producer of the show said, "With Ishq Subhan Allah, we want to break the stereotype and urge people to take a rational stance in matters of religion. We want to spread the message that adherence to religion cannot come at the cost of compromising practicality. Instead, one must apply the core fundamentals of one's religion to move forward in life."
Adnan Khan expressed, "Kabeer's character is of a young Maulvi with a thorough understanding of Islam. While he is very traditional and culture-driven, his personality and outlook is extremely different from Zara's. Being a Muslim, I could easily adapt myself to certain aspects of Kabeer's character which helped me a lot during my preparation. In fact, I could also strongly relate to his inner instincts and religious traits as I am extremely religious in real life, albeit with a modern touch. The concept of the show is extremely engaging and I am looking forward to this exciting new journey".
Eisha Singh said, "Ishq Subhan Allah is a unique concept with a strong message. Zara is a strong and confident woman who doesn't fear any consequences and isn't afraid to ask the right questions. She is deeply rooted in her religious teachings of the holy Quran but applies them intelligently to life with logical reasoning. Zara is progressive but she isn't a rebel or an atheist. She has studied Islam in depth and stands up against the misinterpretation of its teachings. Moreover, I am really excited to play such a strong character and I hope that the audience will enjoy watching this side of me."
In November 2019, Zee TV's home production house, Essel Vision Productions took over the production of the series from Creative Eye Limited.
Owing COVID-19 outbreak, the shootings were stalled since 19 March 2020 and the series telecast was halted midway on 20 March 2020 and was expected to resume shoot after the lockdown ends.

Reception.
Critical response.
"Ishq Subhan Allah" deals with the sensitive and burning issue of Triple Talaq due to which it received negative criticism from some Muslims. Following the first week of its premiere, the show created disappointment between the Muslims and a complaint was filed by Raza Academy, an Islamic association based in Mumbai against the show for wrongful representation of religious facts and maligning the image of the religion.
The complaint by the academy stated that the show "shows Islam in a bad light, the scripts of the entire serial is made to understand that Islam religion needs a lot of changes, revival, amendments".
Since the show is based on a religious concept, many Muslim priests like the Shariat Board Chief, Imam Organization and Jamiat Ulama-e-Hind had also raised objection against the show.
Following a month of its premiere, India Today stated that the well written characters of Zara and Kabir developed the loyal fan following of the show over a month of its run and the concept of Triple Talaq has aroused the interest of the viewers and further expressed, "Apart from its bold and relevant theme, the show's narrative has been spun in an interesting way with well-etched out characters".
On the reception of the show in such a short spam of time, Deepak Rajadhyaksha the Deputy Business Head of Zee TV said, "In keeping with our brand philosophy Aaj likhenge Kal, it is our constant endeavor to present viewers with progressive stories that are not only entertaining but also provoke them into thinking differently, get inspired, take charge of their destiny and work towards an extraordinary future. With Ishq Subhan Allah, we bring audiences the love story of a Muslim couple where the man and woman beg to differ on matters of interpreting and applying religion to their daily lives. We have dwelled into the issue of Triple Talaaq which was never spoken about in a prime-time fiction show. The response that the show has received in its opening week stands testimony to the universal applause and the warm welcome given to the show by Indian audiences."

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401

United Nations Security Council Resolution 2401 was unanimously adopted on 24 February 2018. It calls for a nationwide ceasefire in Syria for 30 days. According to the resolution, the cease-fire does not apply to military operations against the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Al-Nusra Front and their associates, and other terrorist groups as designated by the Security Council.
While People's Protection Units accepted the resolution 2401 and said that it would act, according to the Sana news agency, the Turkish Army continues to fight in Afrin, and has continued its attacks after the passage of the resolution.
French President, Emmanuel Macron, telephoned the Turkish President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, telling him that the truce in Syria also applies in the Afrin Region. "I think the resolution was clear here in naming exactly which groups are considered to be exempt from the ceasefire," State Department Spokesperson Nauert said. Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, Bekir Bozdag, has accused the United States of using double standards.

James Bond 007 (card game)

James Bond 007 is an out-of-print collectible card game by Target Games and Heartbreaker Hobbies.
Publication history.
It was released in November 1995 and was one of many CCGs released during that time that were based on a movie or TV franchise. The first set was called "Goldeneye" and had 207 cards and featured material from every film up to that time, even Thunderball. Some sources claimed the set had as many as 217 or 231 cards. An expansion called "Villains and Women" was scheduled for a 1996 release but never materialized.
Gameplay.
Gameplay involved each player assuming the role as the Directors of the British Secret Service and both played James Bond characters. Players deployed Missions, Villains, Obstacles, Locations, and Henchmen for opponents to fight, and if able, would also play a Plot stack each turn. Each Plot stack would make the mission more difficult. If you had the right cards to complete the mission, you scored points to win the game.
Reception.
Paul Pettengale reviewed "James Bond 007: Golden Eye" for "Arcane" magazine, rating it a 5 out of 10 overall. Pettengale comments that "It sounds great, but in practice very little gets done - it's too hard to get all of the necessary icons and scores together. Instead, each player builds up his own Plots until he has the required number, at which point he declares himself a winner. It's more of a race than a game of strategy."
The reviewer from "Pyramid" #20 said that "One thing separates "Bond" from 99% of the TCGs that have come out in the past year or two: "Bond" is a good game.
The game's combat system was said to be "pointless" as James Bond could not kill a henchmen unless he completed a mission the henchmen was attached to. James Bond would only be killed if he was wounded twice.

Theatre Row Building

The Theatre Row Building is a complex of five Off-Broadway theatres at 410 W 42nd Street on Theatre Row in New York City.
The building is owned by the 501(c)(3) organization non-profit Building for the Arts and is the center piece of an effort to transform the adult entertainment district on West 42nd Street between Ninth and 10th Avenues into an Off Broadway theatre district.
History.
The 42nd Street Development Corporation was formed in 1976 by Fred Papert with a mission of working to revitalize all of 42nd Street which had become home to numerous pornographic businesses. In 1977 Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was elected to its board and in 1977 it began a process to replace porn stores between 9th Avenue and Dyer on the south side of the street with off Broadway theatres, rehearsal spaces and offices. Among the bigger adult venues being replaced were the 42nd Street Playhouse which had signs advertising "All Live Burlesk" and Mermaid. In the same year the Manhattan Plaza apartment tower opened on the north side of 42nd. The first theatre renovations were dedicated in 1978 with Walter Mondale, Joan Mondale and Ed Koch among those attending. The transformation of the district was highlighted in the scenes and settings for the 1981 film "Tootsie"
Audiences to the Off Broadway venues noted in the 1980s that the buildings still maintained the rough edges of their porn history with poor seating, poor bathrooms and air conditioning that worked intermediately so in 1999, under Theatre Row Managing Director Ray Cullom, the core of the Theatre Row Buildings were gut renovated and rebuilt from the ground up with the five theatres opening in brand new spaces in 2002 in the original five-story brick building (even as tall apartment towers rose adjacent to it).
In 2019 the theatre complex was renovated and the individual theatres renamed.

Belleperche Castle

Belleperche was a castle, now destroyed, located in the current town of Bagneux (Allier). It was the seat of one of the chatellenies of Bourbonnais. 
Belleperche was the scene of an important episode of the Hundred Years War, when Louis II, Duke of Bourbon, sieged the fortress to try to deliver his mother, Isabelle de Valois, held captive by a company of Gascon brigands/mercenarys.
History.
The Siege of Belleperche (1369-1370).
During the summer or autumn of 1369, a small group of about 30 Gascon "Free Company" mercenaries in the employ of the English, managed to seize the castle by trickery, where the dowager duchess of Bourbon, Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon, lived. "Free Company" units at this time were mercenaries who when not employed took to brigandry.
Her son-in-law, Louis II, who was then at the court, hastened, assembled troops, and laid siege to Belleperche. The siege lasted three months; the Duke had four great siege engines put in, which sent stones night and day to the fortress, doing great damage. 
Frossart tells us that the siege redoubt was "as strong and as well fortified as a good town might have been".
But a troop of Poitiers and Aquitaine "Free Company" roadmen commanded by two English princes, the Earl of Cambridge, son of King Edward III, and the Earl of Pembroke came to the aid of the besieged and delayed the capture of the castle. Louis II finally succeeded in taking Belleperche, but could not prevent the truckers, Bernardon de la Salle, Bernard de Wisk and Hortingo de la Salle from escaping by taking the duchess hostage; she was not released until two years later for ransom. This episode greatly contributed to the glory of the duke.

Simon of New Orleans

Simon of New Orleans is a French-born artist who first moved to Florida in the late 1980s. He then moved to Louisiana and became known for his painted bright and colorful signs which can include distinguishing lettering, various animals, and slogans that include an assortment of French, English, and local New Orleans dialect. His style is often considered folk art or Haitian. He uses the term "deja vu art" to describe his work. His shop today resides in New Orleans on Magazine Street.
Biography.
Simon Hardeveld was born in Cannes, France in 1951. His mother was French and his father was Dutch. Simon first started working as a chef in France. When he found this to be unsuccessful, he moved to Florida in 1981 to look for work. He met his wife Maria and they ran three different restaurants together. In 1994, he visited New Orleans for Mardi Gras and ended up making it his permanent home. He attempted to find cooking jobs there, but again had little success. He then found a job at a shop called Bush Antiques where he would repair French furniture. There he would take scrap wood and paint signs of food he was cooking at the time. He would place them in the restaurant he worked at in Metairie. People came to drink beer and would want to buy the signs Simon was making. Once he realized he could make money from his signs, he immediately stopped his culinary work. The owner of the antique shop he worked at would let him showcase his work there. Simon has not had any art training.
In 2010, a local New Orleans TV station commissioned Simon to design the set of one of their evening pieces after the vice president of the station ate at a restaurant that displays Simon's work. He considers that as his claim to fame. Simon has also completed a multitude of other commercial signage for the businesses around him. His operation is low-tech, he doesn't use computers or emails, but even with this his signs are found everywhere in the city and almost instantly recognized. On August 20, 2016 he got a book published about his life and art called "Simon of New Orleans". He draws inspiration from people he meets in New Orleans. It's not uncommon for him to dig through trash for objects to use in his art. He spends his days now, still in New Orleans, making signs and with his wife and two bulldogs, Ike and Lily.
Ongoing Feud.
Hand-painted signs have always been a part of New Orleans culture. They cost very little and they are durable. It is a dying market but it has become increasingly competitive. For nearly twenty years Simon and another artist have been arguing about copyright issues. The styles of Simon and the other artist are both considered iconic to the city. In 2016, at a festival in Midcity a sculpture of Simon was put up with him holding a sign that reads "Simon says: Buy the REAL Thing, Buy Dr. Bob Art”. Both sign-makers use the phrase "Be Nice or Leave" in their artworks. Simon claims he doesn't take credit for any of the slogans he uses and the other artist claims Simon is imitating his work.

Sideritis macrostachyos

Sideritis macrostachyos is a species of flowering plant in the family Lamiaceae, native to north and north-eastern Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
Description.
"Sideritis macrostachyos" has branched woody stems. The thick, wrinkled leaves are petiolate (stalked) and crenulate in outline. The upper leaves are oval, the lower ones very large and more rounded. The upper surface of the leaves is green, and ranges from pubescent (softly hairy) in the upper leaves to almost glabrous (smooth) in the lower leaves. The lower surface of the leaves is white with cottony down. The flowers are arranged in terminal spikes which are large, stiff and tufted in appearance. The individual flowers are sessile and arranged in tight whorls separated by small bracts. The seeds are small, brown and rounded.
Taxonomy.
"Sideritis macrostachyos" was first described by Jean Poiret in 1811. The epithet "macrostachyos" is correct as published by Poiret; "stachyos" is an adjective derived from Greek, whose masculine and feminine forms both end in "-os". In some sources, it has been wrongly changed to "macrostachya", or to "macrostachys".

The Rose of Rouen

The Rose of Rouen is a fifteenth-century carol, written after the Battle of Towton in 1461, eulogizing the Yorkist leader and later King Edward IV, Edward, Earl of March.
Historical context.
Before the Battle of Towton took place on 29 March 1461, Queen Margaret, wife of Henry VI of England, led the Lancastrian army south, fresh from victory over the Yorkists at the Battle of Wakefield.
Etymology.
The title of the poem reflects its subject. King Edward, son of Richard, Duke of York, had been born in Rouen, France, in 1442, while his father was on campaign. He was, as a young man, described by contemporaries as taller than average, extremely fit and handsome. His cognizance was a rose en soleil, and so was nick-named the "Rose" of Rouen. This also reinforced his noble parenting as his mother, Cecilly Neville, in praise of her beauty, was called "The Rose of Raby," after the castle of her birth. Edward's connection with the rose continued into his reign, and coins known as "rose nobles" were issued. Edward's birthplace was an important factor in his favour when he was elected king in 1461, as it was thought an omen that Normandy—only recently lost to France in the Hundred Years' War—would be returned to the English.
Creation.
The poem is one of many politically-orientated pieces from the period, and plays heavily on the North—South divide. The army that Margaret brings to the gates of London was northern. Yorkist propaganda heavily emphasised its barbaric nature, particularly fuelling rumours that the Lancastrians were sacking towns as it marched deeper south. The rumours had fertile soil: because, historian Margaret Cron has said, "fear of barbarians from the north was a race memory in southern minds." The Rose of Rouen was written on the premise that not only would northern lords over-run the south, but more, that "they would then live in it and take what they needed including wives and daughters." This is the fate, says the poem, that Edward of York saved England from.
Text.
Like other political poetry of the period, it is careful to identify its protagonists by their cognizances rather than naming them: Edward, of course, is a white rose, his father Richard of York, Duke of York, is a falcon and fetterlock, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick a ragged staff, his uncle William Neville, Lord Fauconberg a fish hook, and John Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk by a white lion.
"The Rose of Rouen"'s style has been described as one of "confident Yorkist triumphalism" as it concentrates on the success of Edward's strategy, from the original London muster to Edward's increasing popularity as he marched north (in which, of course, he swelled his army even more). Hence the long list of nobles (and their heraldic symbols) that the poem presents is another aspect of the propaganda, as historically, at Towton, the Queen had the bulk of the English nobility in the Lancastrian army; Edward, on the other hand, had only the Duke of Norfolk, the Earls of Warwick and Arundel, and Lord Fauconberg with him.

Strabopidae is the only family of the order Strabopida, a group of arachnomorph arthropods.
The order Strabopida contains three valid genera and one doubtful, "Khankaspis", "Paleomerus", "Parapaleomerus" and "Strabops", all assigned in the family Strabopidae. Previously, it also contained the genera "Caryon", "Lemoneites" and "Neostrabops", but after a study, they were reassigned as a trilobite, a glyptocystitid echinoderm and a cheloniellid arthropod, respectively.
Paleomeridae was also previously included as a family, but after the discovery of a fourth "Paleomerus" specimen and its study, Paleomeridae was synonymized into Strabopidae.

A.C. Bang

A. C. Bang was a furrier situated on Strøget in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was founded in 1816 and had status of Purveyor to the Court of Denmark from 1905. Its former building, located at the corner of Østergade (No. 27) and Bremerholm, is from 1932–34 and was designed by Bent Helweg-Møller.
History.
The company was founded by Jørgen Daniel Bang (1790-1864) on 6 September 1816 when he opened a store in his father's building at the corner of Østerfade and Kongens Nytorv. He received a commission for bearskins for the Royal Life Guards and was appointed royal furrier in 1817. 
Bang's son, Anton Christian Bang (1823-1897), took over the company after his father's death in 1861. In 1888 he ceded it to his son Oscar Bang (1863-) who renamed it after his father. The company had many customers in the Danish royal family and was in 1905 once again appointed to royal furrier (from 1963: Purveyors to the Court of Denmark). In 1908 it opened a branch specializing in wholesale one the other side of Østergade. 
Oscar Bang's son Aage Bang (1891-1955) took over the company after his father's death in 1923. He commissioned a new headquarters for the company which was inaugurated at the corner of Østergade and the new street Bremerholm in 1934. In the 1950s A. C. Bang won an international reputation for its mink furs. It launched a collaboration with Balmain, creating furs that were specially adapted for Erik Mortensen's dresses. The ownership of the company passed out of the Bang family.
The 1980s were difficult times for the fur industry internationally and A. C. Bang's stores began to focus on jewelry, accessories and high-end fashion clothing. The market for fur improved somewhat in the 1990s. A. c. Bng opened a second store on Lyngby Hovedgade in Kongens Lyngby and its products were also sold in a high-end chain of department stores in Japan as well as in two shops in Tokyo and Zürich.
Building.
The company's former headquarters at the corner of Østergade and Bremerholm is a seven-story Modernist building. A tall pillar with a statue of Diana trying to catch a small fur animal runs along the full height of the building and a few meters higher on its Strøget side.

Winston Morales

Winston Morales Chavarro is a Colombian poet, novelist and journalist born in Neiva, in 1969. He has a master's degree in Latin American Literature from the Simon Bolivar Andean University in Quito. He is now a full-time professor teaching at the University of Cartagena. His poetry explores the history of mythology and the mystery of life. In his writing he seeks to analyse some of the most poets of the twentieth century in Latin America, including José Antonio Ramos Sucre, Carlos Obregon, César Dávila Andrade and Jaime Sáenz. His texts have been partially translated into French, Italian, English, Polish, German, Rumanian and Chinese included in different national and foreign anthologies.

Review.
Winston Morales is a universal opita, creator of a country where everyone, starting with the towel carriers and rifles on their shoulders, should go live, because there, as in the musical world of Macondo, it makes you want to sing "when the words they become aware of non-being in the presence of so many ghosts invisible ". There in Schuaima, the planet country of the Neivan poet, one can sip with the nose curled by the wind the smell of "the skirts invaded with geraniums" of the girls who inhabit it and who, like all its inhabitants, have "very heart close to the nose "and whose language makes it possible" to converse with the heights, with the acorns, with the wind in its state of purity, with the cosmos in its millenary harmony. "
Ignacio Ramírez
In her verses it happens, the living sage of authentic poetry is latent.
Adriana Herrera
Aniquirona
It is about from a collection of poems that points to another collection of poems -hightest spiral- where there are no words but silences as in the flowers, in tenderness, or in love.
Luis Rafael Gálvez
The raid on Back to Schuaima means conquering territories in the company of the most charming and enchanted character: Aniquirona, the beloved of all the dreamers on earth; the idealized one that puts us in communication with the beings that live beyond the daily flow. This thoughtfulness, the arrival of "Settlers" with their display of beauty captivating almost to delirium. The space that invades the one that follows with its unique aroma of forests and gardens, secret seas or aggressive rocks, or the subversive challenge of presences that are ignored despite their dazzling, sustain the spell, the great orchestration of all the elements.
Matilde Espinosa
These poems also appropriate an overwhelming poetic personality that, as in the other books of the author, creates a world and defends the features of that world, going through all the shades of black and gray, until achieving the very white texture, the turns sublime, religious, mystical, that distinguish the great poets. In Colombia, a country without a doubt difficult, there is poetry of great height, and this is the proof.
Enrique Serrano
By reading these Memoirs of Alexander de Brucco, we are witnessing the creation of a world that is indisputably supported by the aforementioned sacred history but is not defined there. It is now specified through the poem itself and the writing of the verse, defined and defended by the author himself through his images, his metaphors, through the poetic language and the tone that he reaches, through his own world and of his particular conception of history and myth. A book of poems that illuminates, that is full of light and colors and the nuances that are produced when the word passes through the prism that is the verse.
Santiago Tobon
Aniquirona: poetry, affluent towards mystery, deity of sounds and language, which can be transmuted into a woman, into magic or into the fire of things, but which will be, essentially, a song of nature. What river to wade, then, to reach the shore, to the transcendent? Travel with the poet through the forests "of winds and honeysuckle" and "very old chestnut trees", join in "the ceremony of flowers" and woo the light "in the breath of the air". Letting "the continuous voice of the rain" hit the road forever and abandon man in "the sap of the trees", in the ancestral shadow of poetry.
Daniuska Gonzalez
In his Memoirs, Brucco-Morales Chavarro manages to recreate -and that earned him the National Poetry Prize of the University of Antioquia-, in the poetic world, people of blood and bone who love, suffer, fight and have hope; manages to tear life and a new language from the myth.

Carmen Gentile

Carmen Gentile (born June 21, 1974) is an American journalist, author and public speaker who specializes in reporting on conflicts and the developing world. He is the author of the memoir "Blindsided by the Taliban," a dark-humored retelling of his unusual injury in Afghanistan while embedded with American troops near the Pakistani border. In September 2010, Gentile was shot in the side of the head with a rocket-propelled grenade that did not detonate, although it blinded him in his right eye and crushed part of his skull.
Background.
Gentile was born in New Kensington, Pennsylvania and attended Shadyside Academy. He graduated from Villanova University with a degree in philosophy and Islamic studies.
Events of "Blindsided by the Taliban".
On September 9, 2010, Gentile was walking through a remote village in mountainous, eastern Afghanistan in the company of American and Afghan troops. While reporting for CBS - Gentile was a freelance radio reporter who also occasionally contributed video - he was injured when an assailant fired a rocket-propelled grenade from a very short distance away. The ordnance struck Gentile in the side of the head, blinding him in his right eye and crushing bones in his cheek. The rocket then ricocheted off of Gentile and struck a young platoon leader, Lt. Derek Zotto, in the elbow.
Gentile managed to capture his highly unusual injury on video.
He underwent several surgeries including one at a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan. After numerous operations and months of rehabilitation, Gentile returned to Afghanistan and resumed front line reporting, which is chronicled in his critically acclaimed book "Blindsided by the Taliban" (2018).
Since its publication, Gentile has been featured on NBC Today CNN Sunday Morning, C-Span and other leading programs.
In November 2019, it was announced that George Marshall Ruge will direct the feature-film length adaptation of "Blindsided by the Taliban".
Awards.
Gentile is the recipient of the Galloway Award, named for "UPI" combat correspondent and McClatchy Newspapers columnist Joseph Galloway, for a story in "Salon" that is excerpted from "Blindsided by the Taliban" and is said to be both "straight-forward and harrowing."
Motorcycle storytelling.
In recent years, Gentile has combined storytelling from places like Iraq with his passion for motorcycling, writing stories for publications like "Motorcyclist" and the motorcycle media outlet One Down Media, of which Gentile is a founding partner.
He has also ridden in and reported from Mexico and the United States.

Battle of Voronezh River

During the Mongol Invasion of Rus, the Principality of Ryazan was the first to be attacked.
Opposing Forces.
"Main articles: Mongol military tactics and organization and" "Medieval Russian army"
Size and composition of both armies can be roughly estimated based on contemporary chronicles. Contemporary Mongol sources describe Batu as invading with 12-14 tumens, which would give him a nominal strength of 120.000-140.000 men, mostly nomad cavalry archers. However, tumens were often at less than full strength, some elite units with as few as 1.000 horsemen.
On the Russian side, contemporary sources mention only five princes by name, each of whom would be accompanied by his Druzhina, a small retinue of heavy cavalry. The princely retinue surpassed the Mongolian army in armament, both offensive and defensive. Massively heavy armor was used. However, these squads, as a rule, did not exceed the number of several hundred men, and were unsuitable for united actions under a single command.
At the same time, the main part of the Old Russian army was the militia infantry. It was inferior to the nomads in armament and the ability to own it. The militia used axes and hunting spears ("rogatina"). Swords were rarely used, and they had no armor other than plain clothes and fur hats.
For the infantry, consisting of poorly armed peasants and tradesmen, numbers are uncertain. The only specific numbers mentioned for the Russians are 1.700 men of Evpaty Kolovrat(The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan) and 3.000 men under Voivode Dorozh(Battle of the Sit River). However, these were exceptionally large numbers for Russian standards at the time. In 1242, Prince Alexander Nevski in Novgorod could muster no more than 1.000 Druzhina and 2.000 militia for the Battle on the Ice. So, it is safe to estimate that, on average, a Russian prince had hundreds of warriors in his retinue, rather than thousands.
Battle.
After receiving envoys of Batu Khan and sending them to their overlord, Yuri II of Vladimir, border princes of Ryazan, Murom, and Pronsk gathered their forces and made a stand on the river Voronezh, waiting for reinforcements from Vladimir. They received none, and their small force was quickly scattered.
Aftermath.
After the battle, Prince Yuri Igorevich retreated to Ryazan, while his nephew Prince Roman took some of his men north to Kolomna and joined the army of Vladimir-Suzdal.

<doc id="56677459" url="?curid=56677459" title="Dude food">
Dude food

Dude food is a recent food trend largely consisting of heavy, meaty dishes that are thought to appeal to men or express masculinity. Dishes such as hamburgers, hotdogs, or barbeque ribs may be considered dude food, though dude food versions of these dishes often distinguish themselves with gourmet ingredients or exaggerated use of amenities like whiskey, barbecue sauce, bacon, or cheese.
Development.
It is thought that the dude food trend originated in the early 2000s, most likely originating in the southern regions of the United States.
The common theory is that the trend arose from its affinity with the food truck and street food movements, defined by their offerings of “comfort and good quality food” made easily accessible. The trend expanded as a social media phenomenon, and its associated term was added to the Collins dictionary in 2016. Dude food has inspired a growing number of academic and non-academic literature with titles such as "Dudefood: A Guy's Guide to Cooking Kick-Ass Food" and "Dude Food: Recipes for the Modern Guy". Although the trend has spread widely within public consciousness, journalists, bloggers, and academics struggle to coin a precise, widely accepted definition for "dude food." The various proposed definitions share elements such as gender stereotypes, the predominance of heavy meat dishes, and the influence of "feminine" types of food.
Increased awareness of the implications of high cholesterol diets and recent findings suggesting men are twice as likely as women to suffer severe heart problems (heart attacks and coronary heart disease) appears to have broadened dude food offerings so as to encompass light, vegetable-based options, to the detriment of their formerly characteristic meat options.
Geographical diffusion.
The trend is said to have originated in North America, moreover, following its success the trend has geographically expanded into other countries, reaching during the following years Europe, Oceania and also at last Asia. Indeed, the trend seems to have arrived, following its North American origins, at first also in the United Kingdom, where it has allegedly influenced a number of “dude food” inspired restaurants, that have therefore mixed their British national dishes with “dude food” characteristics.
The same seems to be happening also in Australia, combined with the unsatisfaction with fast food and the demand of higher-quality, but not necessarily per se healthy food.
"Dude food" was considered to be one of the next biggest growing trend for the year 2018, to be arriving also in Japan, influencing the usual healthy, rice and fish based cuisine and combining it with the more heavy and greasy dude food methodology.
Dude food advertising.
Dude food advertising and representation tends to follow the traditional gender binary and can be analyzed from a visual perspective, that is by taking into account how gender identity is represented in the food field. Thus, food is considered to be part of those products which are “gendered in a practice of normative sexual dualism reinforced and maintained within (…) cultural institutions of marketing communication and market segmentation”. According to this, advertising plays a significant role in defining this dualism concerning gender identity since its language represents a tool contributing to the creation and reflection of social norms.
According to Katherine Parkin, the gender binary in advertising took shape in 50s, following the theories of Ernest Dichter. She believed that “by convincing Americans of a food’s sex and its resultant gendered identity, as well as its sensuality, advertisers could suggest their foods to meet consumers’ need to fulfill their gender roles” and “Dichter believed that many people categorized the sex of foods. However, his own subscription to a gendered taxonomy of food is evident in his assessment of the findings”.
Moreover, it might be important to notice that not only the food product itself but also the related packaging and advertisement are employed as tools to transmit an idea of how men and women should be, stressing again the cultural and social awareness raised by studies on dude food.
An example of advertising in England is the Ginsters (English food company) advertisement of a beef pasty accompanied by the hashtag #FeedTheMan, in which there is a man that tells a joke in front of his girlfriend’s bosses; but he is talking about Ginsters, thus she has nothing to worry about, because it’s a type of food that makes everyone agree.
In accordance with Lynsey Atkin, advertisement agencies and brands have honed in on a crisis of masculinity in our society and “in times of insecurity, brands can repurpose themselves as champions of the everyman, facilitators of the macho clean, however small. In other words, promising gender-traditional-prowess, like being able to kick a football in a straight line, could be the media-constructed equivalent of helping you grow a beard. Some stereotypes, like male dominance in social situations, are invoked as a nostalgia (a dream of the football-playing and beard-growing of days gone by)".
In some places it can be hard to find an advertisement of men eating chocolate. However, in Canada there is an advertisement of chocolate bar Mr. Big produced by Cadbury, in which the snack is oversexualized and associated with virility, with the slogan “When you're this big they call you Mister”.
Furthermore, specific events and moving tours were organised in Canada and promoted in order to provide dude food dishes and a certain atmosphere; they were born specifically to satisfy men's tastes, whereas women were welcomed but only as supporters of their men.
Gender and food.
According to the feminist scholar Judith Butler, gender is “…an identity tenuously constituted in time (…) instituted through a stylized repetition of acts”. In fact, “...performing food labor is intertwined with performing gender”. In particular, several studies focus on how certain foods, drinks, or ways of eating and drinking are interpreted as “masculine”; a crucial example of this attributed masculinity to certain types of food is represented by dude food. Significantly, scholars have been suggesting that this masculinisation of food practices might allegedly be the expression of masculine privilege which “manifests around food and cooking in a myriad of ways”. Dude food has been extremely crucial as it has raise the interest of the scholarly world as to why the Western cultural and social system defines gender by looking at people's food choices.
Meat is considered to be one of the most important ingredients of “manly” food, since meat conveys meaning of “...sexuality and virility…”. Thus, if masculinity is related to meat, a mostly vegetarian diet is inevitably interpreted as feminine. Not only the consumption of meat, but also the various ways in which it is cooked are associated with a specific idea of masculinity. For instance, barbecued meat and its consumption have always been seen as a rather masculine activity. There is an increase growing literature demonstrating how types of unhealthy food are interpreted to be masculine due to the presence, in our belief system, of cultural stereotypes according to which women tend to eat more healthily than men.
This differentiation could also be attributed to the packaging of food products. Strong stereotypes are deeply embedded also in people’s buying preferences. The cultural basis of these stereotypes regarding food choices and gender perception is the desire from part of our social system to protect and maintain its hegemonic masculine norms. The interest toward dude food is leading people to re-think about the reasons behind food choices and why it should be "...enjoyed. With friends and family- male or female"

Williams was a mentor for the young James Baldwin., who worked for Williams when he was 19 years of age, after moving from Harlem to Greenwich village when his stepfather died. In the early 1960s,after relocating to the West Coast, she opened Connie's Restaurant in the Haight-Ashbury section of San Francisco. She later moved her restaurant to the Fillmore District, San Francisco, after the Hippie movement in the Haight-Ashbury her clientele diminished.
Biography.
Little is known about Williams's early years in Trinidad. A devotee of calypso, she published a booklet in 1959 entitled "12 Songs from Trinidad" which included two songs about the British West Indian labour unrest of 1934–39 oilfield strike in Trinidad: 'King Flecky' and another based on the World War I calypso "Run Your Run Kaiser William".
In 1943 the Calypso Restaurant opened and James Baldwin was hired as a busser and dish washer. Early in Baldwin's career at the Calypso he met artists, writers, and activists such as Beauford Delaney (the modernist painter who introduced James Baldwin to Connie Williams in 1943), Marlon Brando (then an acting student), and labor organizerStan Weir. With the encouragement and support of Williams and Delaney the young Baldwin developed as a writer and intellectual. Williams remained friends with Baldwin throughout his life, hosting a birthday party for him on 20 May 1963 at her San Francisco restaurant on Fillmore Street. Connie took the young James Baldwin 'under her wing'.
Other artists, performers, and intellectuals who frequented The Calypso included Henry Miller, C. L. R. James, Tennessee Williams, Eartha Kitt, Paul Robeson, Richard Wright (author), Grace Lee Boggs, and Paul Robeson.
During and after the U.S. calypso boom which peaked during WWII, Williams promoted many prominent calypsonians and bandleaders in New York City—Gerald Clark, MacBeth the Great, Lord Invader, Wilmoth Houdini, The Duke of Iron, and others—whom she hired to play at holiday dances and carnival balls. These events also featured dancers such as Ismay Andrews and Pearl Primus.
In 1962 Connie founded Connie's West-Indian Restaurant in San Francisco's Haight Ashbury. The restaurant was a favorite for black intellectuals and, like her West VIllage restaurant, was frequented by James Baldwin when he came to San Francisco.
In 1969, Connie’s Restaurant relocated to 1909 Fillmore St in San Francisco after the Hippie "invasion" of Haight-Ashbury.
In 1976 Connie organized the first carnival in San Francisco.
Connie was the founder of Carijama Oakland Carnival, a San Francisco Bay Area carnival begun in the 70s. She was also one of the founders of the Carnival West Coast Caribbean Association.

Jaclyn Corin

Jaclyn Corin (born October 27, 2000) is an American activist against gun violence. She is one of the leaders of the Never Again MSD activist movement and the organizer of a student protest to Tallahassee, Florida. She helped to organize the March for Our Lives nationwide demonstration in Washington and she has been a vocal critic of politicians funded by the National Rifle Association.
Corin was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018."
Education and shooting.
As a student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Jaclyn Corin was the junior class president at the time of the shooting in 2018. Her close friends Joaquin Oliver and Jaime Guttenberg were killed; she had once tutored the alleged gunman and former student at the school, Nikolas Cruz. During the shooting, Corin was locked in with other classmates for several hours, emerging with hands up as instructed by the police SWAT units.
Advocacy.
Corin met with fellow students at Stoneman Douglas, including David Hogg, Emma González and Cameron Kasky, at Kasky's house; they formed the Never Again MSD movement during these meetings. At first it was a small core group of students, but subsequent meetings came to about twenty students. She explained that their media strategy was to knock through the gun-safety defeatism, reframe the debate, and keep making noise with powerful demonstrations. They acted quickly to take advantage of the news coverage.
Corin was a key organizer of the bus trip protest to the Florida state capital on February 20, six days after the shooting. A report in "Vanity Fair" suggested it was her idea to have the bus trip soon after the shooting because it was alive in the news cycle; she said "the news forgets -- very quickly -- we needed a critical mass event." Working with fellow students-turned-activists Cameron Kasky and David Hogg, she recruited several hundred MSD students to make an eight-hour bus trip to Tallahassee as part of a "lightning strike". She helped engineer the behind-the-scenes logistics including transportation, chaperone and sleeping arrangements, scheduling meetings with Florida lawmakers and getting permission slips from parents. She demanded the group wear normal school attire and not quibble about bus seating; when some asked for changes to sit with friends, she said "No -- get on your bus." The trip was organized largely by social media and texting.
Corin was a key planner of the March for Our Lives nationwide student protest that occurred on March 24. She advocates that adults register to vote and vote, and that children pre-register. She discussed media coverage:
Corin has made YouTube videos; one called "WhatIf" got 1.4 million views in three days. She has appeared on national television. In anticipation of the March for Our Lives, she appeared on the March 21 episode of the Rachel Maddow Show, along with Gonzalez and Sarah Chadwick. She is scheduled to speak at a rally in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on March 29. She, Gonzalez, Hogg, Kasky and Alex Wind are pictured on the third week of March's "Time" cover.
Corin criticized the NRA and gun manufacturers for touting the Ideal Conceal, a handgun that folds up to resemble a smart phone. She faulted the NRA for "enforcing the normality of shooting other people"; further, she argued that police, confronting people including persons of color with smart phones, might believe that their phones were weapons, and shoot them accidentally.

Gametime

Gametime is a mobile ticket marketplace app developed by San Francisco-based Gametime United Inc., which was founded by Brad Griffith in late 2012. The app was released for iOS in May 2013, with an Android version released in March 2014. In multiple funding rounds following the app's initial release, Gametime has raised a total of from various investors. The app received an award from each SportsBusiness Daily and the Appy Awards in 2017, and Gametime United was named among the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. in various categories by Deloitte, "Inc." and Accel Partners.
Features.
Gametime allows users to purchase tickets for sports events, including MLB, NFL, NCAA, NBA, NHL and MLS games and WrestleMania, AMA Supercross Championship and PGA Tour events, as well as music events, such as concerts, and other performances, including comedy and theater. The app compiles data of unsold tickets from various suppliers and displays the 50 best results for the selected venue, determined by price and location through a proprietary algorithm. To do so, Gametime curates available tickets from suppliers that include teams, primary and secondary ticket outlets, and users of the app itself. Seat options are accompanied by photographs of the view from the seat and the seat's location in the form of a map pin on a map of the venue, where possible.
As time draws closer to an event's start, Gametime strategically reduces ticket prices for last-minute customers, as those tickets generally lose value during this timeframe. Tickets for each event are available until 90 minutes after the event started. Gametime recorded that around 80% of transactions take place up to seven days before an event, 50% of those on the day of the event, and more than 10% after that event's start. Tickets purchased through the app are made available digitally through the customer's phone, with a barcode that would be scanned by the venues' scanners or entrance personnel, removing the need to print the tickets. Griffith, who uses the app himself, considered this to be the app's best feature. Payment transactions are handled using Apple Pay and Google Pay, respective to the user's platform; additional integrations for PayPal's Venmo service were added on the day of the service's third-party support introduction.
Gametime High Fives, a rewards program introduced in August 2015, rewarded people who bought tickets to three or more MLB events in which the home team won, a voucher for use within the app. In April 2016, Gametime was updated with the Snap and Sell feature, which added a user-side ticket resale functionality to the app. Using Snap and Sell, users can take pictures of sports tickets, which are then analyzed using optical character recognition for validity and placed onto the app's marketplace if they apply to its venue lineup. Griffith stated that the feature sought to make selling tickets as easy and accessible as possible, claiming that it only required three taps to bring the ticket to the market, when compared to competitors' "75 taps' worth of data entry" for the same functionality.
Gametime Connect, released in June 2016, saw the integration of two friends-based features; users could see whether friends were presently selling tickets, and were given the ability to directly buy those specific tickets, and whether friends were going to attend an event, enabling users to buy tickets for it so they could attend it together. Gametime FanViews, introduced in April 2017, allows Gametime customers to share their feedback on the quality and atmosphere of the seating they had acquired through the app, and share photos of the event they attended. Information collected through FanViews is aggregated and presented to future customers at checkout.
Development.
Inception and expansion.
Founder Brad Griffith, formerly a senior financial analyst for Google, developed the idea of a digital instant-ticketing system for mobile devices when he missed the first inning of an October 2012 National League Championship Series game between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals. Griffith had realized too late that, in order to validate the tickets, he had to print them out. He was convinced that there had to be a simpler way to purchase event tickets, and eventually decided to start developing an app that would fit this purpose, and founded San Francisco-based Gametime United to go with it. The resulting product was launched for smartphones running iOS in May 2013. An Android version of the app followed in March 2014, and one for Apple Watch devices was released in May 2015.
Initially, Gametime only offered tickets for select stadiums in San Francisco, but soon expanded to Los Angeles. The number of available venues rose to 35 cities the U.S. and Canada by July 2015, and covered 48 cities by February 2016, with over 500 teams featured. Presently, Gametime offers tickets in 60 cities in North America. In August 2015, Gametime advanced into offering tickets for college football, adding 50 of the U.S.' top programs to their catalog. In December 2015, Gametime announced that they would expand into tickets from the music industry, such as those for concerts, to broaden their market availability. In addition to last-minute sales, as is with the case with their sports tickets, admissions to music venues would also be available for purchase several months in advance.
In March 2017, Gametime United employed 80 staff members in its San Francisco offices. According to Griffith, the average Gametime user is a 31-year old white male with a household income of , younger than average customers of other companies in the market, and said to be "nearly an inverse" of MLB's demographic. By focusing on the mobile market, Gametime aims at targeting millennials, which comprise 75% of the app's user base.
Funding.
Initial funding for Gametime covered backed by the founders of HotelTonight, the owners of sports clubs like those of the San Francisco Giants, and Xobni co-founder Matt Brezina. In a September 2014 seed funding round led by Accel Partners, Gametime received a total of . Investors included executives of HotelTonight, Box, the San Francisco Giants, the Vancouver Whitecaps, Yahoo!, TIBCO Software, the Sacramento Kings and StubHub. Following the investment, StubHub's founder and investment partner, Colin Evans, moved to Gametime United as chief revenue officer. A series A round, again led by Accel Partners, was held in May 2015, adding . Top investors included key people of the Philadelphia 76ers, the New Jersey Devils and Trunk Club, among multiple partners from previous rounds. An independently hosted series B round attracted new investors, such as GV, Evolution Media Partners and StartX. The round, held in September 2016, raised another for Gametime. According to Crunchbase, Gametime has raised a total in funding to date.
Partnerships.
In September 2015, Gametime signed a partnership with digital fan destination Bleacher Report for integration within the latter's Team Stream app. As part of the deal, Team Stream would show its users advertisements of inexpensive tickets for upcoming games of their sports teams of interest, which then directly linked to the venues' pages within Gametime. In May 2017, Ticketmaster entered an agreement with Gametime which allowed them to distribute their tickets over the app, with proceeds shared between the two companies and the tickets' respective teams. With the partnership, Ticketmaster sought to better reach Gametime's young target audience and "fish where the fish are". According to Ticketmaster's chief commercial officer, Greg Economou, 12,000 teams and venues that used Ticketmaster would receive a secondary purchase option through Gametime. Financials of the deal were not disclosed.
Recognition.
With revenue growth of 3,856% between 2013 and 2016, Gametime United was named the "fastest growing digital content/media/entertainment company" in Deloitte's 2017 Technology Fast 500. "Inc." observed a 34,021% overall three-year growth for the company, as well as revenue in 2016, judging them the third-fastest growing company in America in their 2017 "Inc. 5000". At the same time, "Inc." further revealed Gametime United as the fastest-growing consumer products company in the U.S. According to Brian O'Malley of Accel Partners, Gametime reached in gross sales in their 2016 fiscal year, because of which it was "the fastest growing ticketing company ever".

2020 Venezuelan parliamentary election

Parliamentary elections were held in Venezuela on 6 December 2020. Aside from the 167 deputies of the National Assembly who are eligible to be re-elected, the new National Electoral Council president announced that the assembly would increase by 110 seats, for a total of 277 deputies to be elected.
The opposition parties that make up the Democratic Unity Roundtable coalition agreed unanimously not to participate in the election, stating the reason as irregularities and their complaints during the planning of the process and arguing that it was likely the election would be fraudulent. Twenty-seven political parties signed the agreement, including the four largest opposition parties Popular Will, Justice First, Democratic Action and A New Era.
The opposition criticized the appointment of the members of the National Electoral Council by the Supreme Tribunal, stating that it is under the purview of the National Assembly, and at least seven political parties had their board of directors suspended or replaced by the pro-government Supreme Tribunal of Justice, including Popular Will, Justice First, Democratic Action, and Copei, as well as left-wing political parties, including Tupamaro, Fatherland for All, and Red Flag. Opposition politicians Henrique Capriles and Stalin González initially encouraged participation in the elections. They later withdrew and demanded better electoral conditions.
The Lima Group, the International Contact Group, the European Union and the United States rejected holding parliamentary elections in 2020, insisting in the necessity of holding elections "with free and fair conditions." The International Contact Group, headed by Uruguay, stated the formation of the Electoral Council "undermines the credibility of the next electoral process." The Organization of American States (OAS) stated the appointment of the Electoral Council was "illegal", rejecting it, and further stated that independent bodies are needed for "transparent, free and fair" elections to take place in the country. In July, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, headed by Michelle Bachelet, said that "the recent decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice diminish the possibility to build conditions for democratic and credible electoral processes" and "appoint new National Electoral Council rectors without the consensus of all the political forces."
Background.
Since the 1999 Constituent Assembly elections, the National Assembly was dominated by alliances supportive of President Hugo Chávez. In the 2005 parliamentary elections, most opposition parties decided to withdraw, resulting in all seats being won by the Fifth Republic Movement and other parties supportive of Chávez. For the 2010 elections, an alliance of opposition parties was formed by the Democratic Unity Roundtable to contest the elections, and managed to win 64 seats. The PSUV, which was an alliance formed by Chávez from the Fifth Republic Movement and a number of smaller parties, won 96 seats, maintaining their majority, but lost their two-thirds and three-fifths supermajority. Fatherland for All, a small left-wing party, won two seats.
After Chávez's death in 2013, his hand-picked successor Maduro was narrowly elected president, continuing Chávez' ideological influence. In the 2015 parliamentary elections, the Democratic Unity Roundtable alliance gained a supermajority of 112 seats against 55 won by the GPP. In terms of popular vote, the MUD received 7.7 million votes, an increase of 2.4 million from the 2010 elections, becoming the most voted party in Venezuelan electoral history. The result was a decisive defeat for the PSUV and its wider alliance (GPP), which lost control of the Assembly for the first time since 1999.
In the midst of the ongoing constitutional crisis, a different body, the Constituent Assembly, was elected in 2017, with the intent of re-writing the Venezuelan Constitution. From that point forward, the two legislatures have operated in parallel, with the National Assembly forming the primary opposition to president Nicolás Maduro, and with the Constituent Assembly being his primary supporters. As of May 2019, the Constituent Assembly mandate is expected to expire on 31 December 2020, a measure that replaces the previous resolution of August 2017 that established its validity for at least two years.
In February 2018, Nicolás Maduro proposed holding the parliamentary elections alongside the presidential elections scheduled between April and May of that year. However, the proposal was later rejected by the National Electoral Council, which stated that holding both elections together would be too complicated. A year later, Maduro announced support, which was proposed by the Constituent Assembly, for an early election within 2019. During a speech at a pro-government rally celebrating the 20th anniversary of the revolution led by former President Hugo Chávez, He stated: "They [the opposition] want to bring forward elections, let's have elections."
In November 2019, Juan Guaidó and Stalin González, along with former rector of the National Electoral Council, Vicente Díaz, declared that the election would not solve the nationwide crisis. Guaidó said that the opposition would not participate in any discussion that did not contribute to the solution of the crisis.
On 7 March 2020 there was a fire in the National Electoral Council warehouses in Filas de Mariche, Caracas. Tibisay Lucena, president of the Council, announced the loss of 582 computers, 49 408 voting machines, 400 electronic ballots, 22 434 power inverters, 49 323 fingerprint scanners and 127 ballots that were due to be withdrawn. Andrés Caleca, former rector of the Electoral Council, assured that hardware-wise the Electoral Council "was in zero", and that the electoral infrastructure, the machines and fingerprint scanners, as well as the operative capacity to program the machines were lost in the fire.
In mid-2020, the opposition politicians Henrique Capriles and Stalin González encouraged participation in the elections. As a response, Juan Guaidó created a "unitary pact" along with the leaders of thirty-seven political parties, reaffirming to not participate in the elections and to summon a referendum in Venezuela. After meeting with Guaidó, the leader of the political party Vente Venezuela, María Corina Machado, rejected the proposal of a referendum, criticizing the incapacity of Guaidó to depose Maduro from power and stressing the importance of a military option. Elliott Abrams, the United States Special Representative for Venezuela, described María Corina's proposal as "surrealist". Capriles and González later withdrew from the electoral process to pressure better electoral conditions.
In September 2020, Maduro announced that military officers would look after voters in their homes to vote as part as a "biosecurity plan", and rejected the possibility of postponing the elections.
Supreme Tribunal of Justice chooses new Electoral Council.
In October 2019, the National Assembly approved to start the appointment of the postulations committee of the new members of the National Electoral Council (CNE). In May 2020, the Committee of Electoral Candidacies, in charge of appointing a new National Electoral Council of Venezuela (CNE), announced that it would suspend its meetings because of the pandemic.
The Supreme Tribunal of Justice (TSJ), loyal to Nicolás Maduro, declared in June that the National Assembly had not named rectors for the CNE. The opposition denounced it as attempt to obstruct the procedure for the elections.
The TSJ decided on 12 June 2020 to name the electoral board that would oversee the parliamentary elections. Indira Alfonzo was declared as the new chief of the CNE through Facebook. Members of the National Assembly argue that the TSJ is not authorized to choose the board, according to the Venezuelan constitution. The Vice-President of the National Assembly, Juan Pablo Guanipa, declared “As Venezuelans we make our demand to the world for a free vote!”, calling Maduro's government a dictatorship. Juan Guaidó posted on Twitter "We haven’t given up our rights. They’ve got the game locked up and they’ve already started hanging up their phones. Don’t be fooled by their distractions.” According to Associated Press, moderate opponents of Maduro administration, trying to reach an agreement to create free elections, found the TSJ decision "disheartening".
Luis Vicente León from the Venezuelan poll firm Datanálisis, said that the TSJ selected two members from outside the United Socialist Party of Venezuela, in order to give the appearance of balance, but that this ultimately does not change anything, as the TSJ acted unilaterally, outside any political negotiation. León said “This will not generate any confidence that the opposition parties participated or lead to mass participation in an election. It only adds a brushstroke of opposition participation to a biased elections commission, amplifying the country’s division without solving the problem.”
Suspension of political parties directives.
On 27 August 2019, the Supreme Court of Justice suspended the board of directors of the Copei to appoint a board of directors chaired by Miguel Salazar. Previously, the National Social Christian Assembly elected Mercedes Malavé on March 27, 2019.
In May, Tarek William Saab, the Attorney General appointed by the National Constituent Assembly, requested that the Supreme Tribunal of Justice declare Popular Will as a "terrorist organization," which would lead to the prohibition of the party. Popular Will rejected said accusations.
On 15 June, the Supreme Tribunal suspended the directive board of Democratic Action to appoint a new one presided by José Bernabé Gutiérrez, days after his brother José Luis Gutiérrez was appointed by the high court as rector of the National Electoral Council. The former was expelled from the party the following day.
On 17 June, the Supreme Tribunal proceeded to take the same measure with the Justice First party and appointed an ad hoc directive board presided by José Brito, who would be responsible for the appointment of the rest of the positions of Justice First, as well as the regional, municipal and local authorities.
On 7 July, the Supreme Tribunal also suspended the directive board of Popular Will, becoming the third political organization judicially intervened in the last month, appointing an ad hoc directive board presided by José Gregorio Noriega, previously expelled from the party. The high court sentenced that Noriega "could use the electoral card, logo, symbols, emblems, colors and any other own concept" of the party and suspended the expulsions of both Noriega as Guillermo Luces and Lucila Pacheco, members of the new board.
On 20 July, the Supreme Tribunal suspended the directive board of Republican Movement and appointed an ad hoc directive board presided by Manuel Rivas. The ad hoc board of directors of the party may use the electoral card, logo, symbols, emblems, colors and any other concept of the party.
On 18 August, the Supreme Tribunal additionally intervened in the far-left party Tupamaro, giving the party directive to an ad hoc board to use the seats, name, electoral card, symbols and electoral emblems of the party. The intervention took place after the party announced an electoral alliance without the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV). On 21 August, the Supreme Tribunal did the same with the left-wing party Fatherland for All, which also announced an electoral alliance without the PSUV; the high court also intervened in the Red Flag and Compromiso País parties, handing over the party to an ad hoc board.
After Henrique Capriles encouraged participation in the elections, the Supreme Tribunal reverted the intervention of the Justice First party, stripping the directive board from José Brito. Justice First ratified after the sentence that they would not participate in the elections.
Violence.
On 10 August, colectivos took over with sticks, bottles and tear gas the two main seats in Caracas - in La Florida and in El Paraíso. At least four journalists were injured during the events.
After the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) announced their separation from the pro-government coalition Great Patriotic Pole, along with other parties such as Fatherland for All, and a new platform named "Revolutionary Popular Alternative," the PCV denounced the presence of Bolivarian Intelligence Service officials in their headquarters in Puerto Cabello, in Carabobo.
Opposition boycott.
The opposition parties that make up the opposition coalition Democratic Unity Roundtable agreed unanimously to not participate in the election, citing irregularities complaints during the planning of the process and arguing that it was likely they would be fraudulent. Twenty-seven political parties signed the agreement, including the four largest opposition parties Popular Will, Justice First, Democratic Action and A New Era.
The parties that signed the document were: Acción Democrática, Alianza del Lápiz, Aprisal, Bandera Roja, Camina, Copei. Cuentas Claras, Encuentro Ciudadano, Fuerza Liberal, GuajiraVen, Izquierda Democrática, La Causa R, Moverse, Movimiento Republicano, NUVIPA, Parlinve, Movimiento por Venezuela, PDUPL, Primero Justicia, Proyecto Venezuela, Sociedad, Un Nuevo Tiempo, Unidad NOE, Unidos Para Venezuela, Vanguardia Popular, Voluntad Popular and Unidad Política Popular 89.
International position.
The Lima Group, the International Contact Group, the European Union and the United States rejected holding parliamentary elections in 2020 "without free or fair conditions."
In a joint statement, the members of the Lima Group declared that they rejected and disavowed the appointment of the National Electoral Council members by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, defining it as "illegal" and arguing that it "openly infringes the Venezuelan constitution and undermines the minimal necessary conditions for any electoral process and of the return of democracy in Venezuela."
The International Contact Group, headed by Uruguay, lamented the renovation of the Electoral Council that "undermines the credibility of the next electoral process." The public declarations was agreed by Bolivia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, the United Kingdom, the European Union and seven of its member states: France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.
The Organization of American States (OAS) rejected the "illegal" appointment of the Electoral Council and reminded that independent bodies are needed for "transparent, free and fair" elections to take place in the country.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, headed by Michelle Bachelet, indicated that "the recent decisions of the Supreme Tribunal of Justice diminish the possibility to build conditions for democratic and credible electoral processes" and "appoint new National Electoral Council rectors without the consensus of all the political forces and interfere in the internal organization of two of the main opposition political parties."
The OAS Secretary General, Luis Almagro, and former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe González, condemned the violent takeover of the Democratic Action seats in Caracas.
In September, the European Union rejected Nicolás Maduro's invitation to send an observer mission to the electoral process, stressing that the ruling party had not met the "minimal conditions" for the process to be considered "credible and transparent".
Sanctions.
The United States sanctioned Alfonzo and three others on 4 September 2020, accusing them of facilitating the illegitimate Maduro regime’s efforts to undermine the independence and democratic order of Venezuela. According to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, he said that "the corrupt Maduro regime is attempting to seize control of the National Assembly of Venezuela through a fraudulent election.” Alfonzo was already sanctioned by the Canadian government in May 2018, following the recent presidential election considered by Canada and part of the international community as "not free or fair."
Complaints.
As of May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, electoral organizations such as the Venezuelan Electoral Observatory and the Education Assembly Electoral Observation Network, assured that there were many obstacles in Venezuela left to surpass before an electoral process takes place by December 2020, including conditions, technological problems and a lack of agreement between political factions, saying that having the elections in 2020 did not appear feasible.
The former governor of the Kariña indigenous tribe, Wilson Espinoza, and member of the Guajira Rights Committee, José Marín, have protested against the Special Rules for the Election of Indigenous Deputies to the National Assembly ( published on 24 July by the Electoral Council, arguing that it removed the direct vote to the indigenous minority, that it drastically reduced the indigenous representation in the National Assembly for the next elections and that it imposes a second degree vote to the group. On 26 July, in a public statement, Espinoza declared that the rules were redacted and published without consulting the electoral directory, without considering the suggestions and proposals of indigenous groups and warned that the thirty days term established by the rules for the process of community assemblies, spokespeople choice, general assemblies and vote by rising hand of the deputies that will represent them in the National Assembly is unreal and impossible to accomplish, as well as being a COVID-19 high contagion risk.
In July, the electoral non-governmental organizations Súmate and denounced that the biosecurity measures during the Electoral Registry update and registration process were deficient, including little or no equipment disinfection, such as fingerprint scanners or pens; incorrect use of face masks, lack of gloves and the social distancing non-compliance.
On 29 July, a group of former authorities of the extinct Supreme Electoral Council submitted an appeal to the Supreme Tribunal to ask for the suspension of the new changes approved by the Electoral Council. The requesters were Andrés Caleca, Eduardo Roche Lander, Ildemaro Martínez, Rafael Lander y Egleé González Lobato. Another group of former authorities of the National Electoral Council, jurists, politicians and experts submitted an appeal to the Supreme Tribunal asking for the suspension of the process, asking for time to organize it in a "reasonable and honorable" manner. The initiative was accompanied by the recollection of at least 8 000 signatures in the next few days.
On September, civil society organizations started the "Venezuela Documenta" (Venezuela Documents) platform to support citizens in the "reports and registries of incidents and patterns linked to the weakening of democracy, human rights, political participation and electoral processes in the country." The initiate is made of the Citizen Electoral Network, the Justice and Peace Center (Cepaz), the Communication and Democracy Global Observatory, Sinergy, "Dale Letra" and "Diálogo Social".
Campaign.
In late October, the chief commander of Los Andes region, mayor general Ovidio Delgado Ramírez announced "a campaign to deliver firewood to the population".
During the final campaign, Diosdado Cabello declared: "He who does not vote, does not eat. For the one that does not vote there is no food. A quarantine is applied there." National Assembly deputy Delsa Solórzano announced that she would send the declaration to International Criminal Court. Cabello later declared that his statement was taken out of context, saying that "I said in Bolívar that if someone does not vote, the woman should tell the man that she will not give him food".
Electoral system.
Venezuela uses a parallel voting system, with 144 seats to be chosen by closed list proportional representation allocated using the d'Hondt method, and 133 seats to be chosen by first-past-the-post voting in 87 geographical constituencies.
By decision of the National Electoral Council, Venezuela's electoral system replaced the international observation figure by a "convenient accompaniment".
On 5 June, the Supreme Tribunal "disapplied" Articles 14, 15, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182 and 186 of the Organic Law of Electoral Processes and modified the indigenous circumscription special mechanism.
Seats number.
On 30 June, National Electoral Council president, Indira Alfonzo, announced the increase of the National Assembly by 110 seats more, for a total of 277 deputies. The move was interpreted as an attempt by Maduro to pack the assembly with supporters. 
Indigenous representation.
Among the Electoral Law articles that will stop to be apply are the ones related to the conditions, requirements and ways in which the indigenous representatives will be elected for parliament. According to the Electoral Council, the disapplication has the objective to "reinvidicte the indigenous communities traditions, uses and practices." The new Electoral Council normative establishes a completely new electoral system, in which the personal and direct vote is replaced by a delegate system that will vote in the name of the indigenous communities, eliminating the first grade vote that has existed in previous electoral processes, with the exception of the 1999 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election.
The Electoral Council established that the indigenous communities must organize in a body it called "community assemblies", which will meet and work pursuant to the schedule established by the Electoral Council. The meetings must also have the presence of an "electoral coordination agent" appointed by the Electoral Council that will be responsible for the documentation produced in the assemblies. The community assemblies have to choose for a yet undetermined number of spokespeople, which in turn will go to general assemblies in which they will proceed to choose their respective indigenous deputies, according to their region, representing their community in a second grade vote. The vote will take place on election day and with the presence of indigenous applicant organizations witnesses that assist to the act and the electoral coordinator appointed by the Electoral Council. The vote will be done "rising hands" and the votes will be reflected in an act that will afterwards be sent to the Regional Electoral Board and the Regional Electoral Office of the respective entity. The National Council will proceed to count every received acts; the candidate that receives the majority of the votes of the spokespeople will be elected as deputy.
The normative violates Articles 3 (vote personalization) and 16 (nominal vote right) of the Electoral Law, as well as Articles 5 (sovereignty exercised indirectly through the vote) and 63 (universal, direct and secret vote, and guaranty of vote personalization) of the constitution. The changes made by the Electoral Council also violate Article 298 of the constitution, which forbids modifying the Electoral Processes Law in the six months prior to the election. According to constitutionalist lawyer Juan Manuel Raffalli, the changes are illegal because they do not offer a direct and secret election as enshrined in the constitution.
Results.
Amid a boycott by a majority of the opposition, the PSUV-led Great Patriotic Pole alliance won a supermajority of seats. Turnout was around 30.5%.

Glanfahan

Glanfahan is a townland on the Dingle Peninsula, Ireland, notable for its large collection of clocháns, which form a National Monument.
Location.
Glanfahan is located on the southern slopes of Mount Eagle, overlooking Dingle Bay, south of Dunquin.
History.
It is difficult to establish dates for Glenfahan as the drystone technique has been used in Ireland for millennia. However, it is believed to date to the early Christian period (5th–8th centuries AD), linked to the monastic traditions of the region and perhaps the pilgrimage route to Skellig Michael.
Other historians place their construction in the 12th century, when Norman invaders forced the Gaelic Irish to peripheral areas like the Dingle Peninsula.
It has been theorised that the huts were inhabited by the unfree and cashels by the freemen. Some Irish cashels remained in occupation up to the 18th century AD.
In the 19th century a cross-slab and rotary quern were found in Cahermurphy.
Some of the archeological sites were damaged in the 20th century by agricultural "improvements."
Excavations in 2011–12 under "Clochaun 3" turned up a sharpening stone, hammerstone and pieces of flint and quartz. Bone finds included sheep, goats (with flensing marks) and fish, as well as a wrasse tooth of a kind used in amulets. Bivalve shells and hazelnut shells were also found.
Description.
There are 417 recorded dry stone structures, 19 souterrains and 18 standing stones in the area.

Attack on Amsterdam (1650)

The Attack on Amsterdam in July 1650 was part of a planned coup d'état by stadtholder William II, Prince of Orange to break the power of the regenten in the Dutch Republic, especially the County of Holland. The coup failed, because the army of the Frisian stadtholder William Frederick, Prince of Nassau-Dietz got lost on the way to Amsterdam in the rainy night of 29 to 30 July. It was discovered, and once the city had been warned, it had enough time to prepare for an attack. The attempted coup made the House of Orange extremely unpopular for a lengthy period of time, and was one of the main reasons for the origins of the First Stadtholderless Period (1650–1672).
Background.
The cause of the conflict lay in a dispute on ending the Eighty Year's War. The provinces of Utrecht and Zeeland and stadtholder William II wanted to continue the war: Utrecht for more favourable peace terms, Zeeland to keep blocking the Flemish ports for commercial ships, and William II because military achievements gave him more prestige and power. The other provinces, led by Holland, preferred peace to secure trade and reduce army upkeep costs. The latter eventually had their way when the Peace of Münster was signed on 30 January 1648.
Early 1649, the army still consisted of 35,000 mercenaries, and Holland (especially the dominant city of Amsterdam) wanted to reduce their number to 26,000. After negotiations, a compromise was reached, and 29,250 troops were left by summer. William II, however, was keen on leading a punitive expedition to England, where his father-in-law, king Charles I, had been decapitated on 30 January 1649, and the republic had been proclaimed; whilst the States of Holland urged to reduce the number of troops even further.
William II devised plans to get his way. At the end of 1649, a false pamphlet later known as "The Eleven Articles" ("De elf artikelen") was widely distributed, claiming that Amsterdam was in league with England and intended to strike the other six provinces and everyone in Holland who opposed Amsterdam. It is thought that William II had this rumour spread to win sympathy for his cause against Amsterdam. He wanted to execute his plans in the spring of 1650, stemming from his astrological belief that the position of the Moon, Mars and Saturn would be favourable for a change of government, but eventually he would not act until summer. In May 1650, the States of Holland decided with 11 votes to 8 to disband the troops, and henceforth refused to pay part of the remaining soldiers' salary. The States General called the resolution of Holland illegal, landing the Republic in a political crisis. The States General argued that defence was a duty of the entire Union, and not of the constituent provinces: Holland should pay its due. Morally supported by the States General, William II first decided to appoint a commission (with himself as its chairman) that would visit the cities of Holland to plead for a large army, but without success. Then he resorted to coercion.
Failed coup d'état.
The Frisian stadtholder William Frederick of Nassau-Dietz advanced across the Veluwe in the night of 29 July on the orders of William II. He headed for Amsterdam to take the city by surprise, and to force it to pay the soldiers' wages. Two of the three companies, under Cornelis van Aerssen and Frederick van Dohna-Carwinden, lost the trail in the middle of the rainy night on the misty heath near Hilversum. A postman from Hamburg heading for Amsterdam ran into the forces, and warned Gerard Andriesz. Bicker (1622–1666), the drost of Muiden, who immediately left for Amsterdam to inform his uncle, burgemeester Cornelis Bicker. The latter and former burgemeester Andries Bicker rallied the city guard, hired 2,000 mercenaries, lifted the bridges, closed the gates and positioned the artillery. Not until 9 o'clock in the morning the stadtholderian troops reached Abcoude. Now that a rushed entry was made impossible, they camped on the outskirts. An attack was postponed for the time being.
Meanwhile, William II had six prominent members of the States of Holland arrested. The delegates from Haarlem, Delft, Hoorn, Medemblik, and Dordrecht (Jacob de Witt), were abducted under a strict guard to Loevestein Castle, some accompanied by their servants or their sons.
On 3 August, there were seventy companies under William Frederick's command near Abcoude. Burgemeester Cornelis Bicker took on Amsterdam's defence. William decided to negotiate with the Oetgens faction, opponents of the regenten family Bicker. On the condition that Andries and Cornelis Bicker would be put out of their offices, William would be prepared to withdraw his troops.
Aftermath.
The coup was largely a failure because the attack on Amsterdam did not succeed. Under pressure of the States, the Loevesteinian regenten were released one by one from 17 to 22 August. The regenten now realised that the stadtholder was prepared to use violence to maintain and expand his power. This led to the rise of the so-called Loevestein faction amongst regenten who desired a republic without Orange. Before 1650, few had taken an interest in justifying or altering the form of government of the Dutch Republic, and the role of the stadtholderate within it (Hugo Grotius was an exception to this; his "On the Antiquity of the Batavian Republic" (1610) primarily attempted the first). At Leiden University, professors even taught to their students that a moderate monarchy was the best form of government. After William II's attempted coup of July 1650, however, these attitudes would change radically.
On 6 November, William II unexpectedly died of smallpox aged 24. Shortly after on 14 November, princess-widow Mary Henrietta Stuart gave birth to a son, the later king-stadtholder William III. After the sudden passing of William II, Groningen and Drenthe decided to appoint William Frederick as their stadtholder as well. However, his attempts to have the other provinces recognise him as the regent of William III did not work out (only in Overijssel he was accepted as such by two-thirds of the province). With the failed stadtholderian coup still in fresh memory, the lack of a stadtholder was a welcome turn of events. Thus, the rest of the Republic entered the First Stadtholderless Period. During the Grand Assembly of 1651, these five provinces definitively agreed not to appoint a new stadtholder. 
In the Act of Seclusion, a secret clause that was a peace condition for the Dutch defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War (1652–54), the States of Holland also promised The Protectorate to never appoint William III as stadtholder, and in his Deduction the Loevesteinian leader Johan de Witt would successfully defend this deal in the States General. This situation remained in force until the "Rampjaar" (1672).

Bernard de Wisk

Bernard de Wisk was a mercenary captain and sometime brigand of the Hundred Years War.
Wisk started out a mercenary. However, after the Treaty of Brétigny was signed on 8 May 1360, Wisk found himself unemployed and so turned to Brigandry. that ranged the French country side pillaging towns.
In 1369, with Bernardon and Hortingo de la Salle, he seized Belleperche Castle, home to Isabella of Valois, Duchess of Bourbon, mother-in-law of the king, Charles V of France and demanded a ransom.
The castle was, however, besieged by the troops of the Dukes of Bourbon and Burgundy. The Duke of Bourbon (Louis II, Duke of Bourbon) was her son, and John Frossart tells us that the siege redoubt he organized was "as strong and as well fortified as a good town might have been". The "Free companies" in the castle were expelled, but they took the duchess with them as hostage.
The Duchess remained a prisoner until 1372, when the king arranged for the ransom to be paid.

Kiddie Kapers Parade

 
Kiddie Kapers Parade is a Salinas, California based evening parade held annually since 1930. It is notable as the participants are limited to children. It is held in conjunction with “Big Week” which includes the California Rodeo Salinas, and it usually precedes the Colmo Del Rodeo night parade, as well as daily horse parades down Main Street. Children don costumes, ride decorated bicycles, appear as the Jolly Green Giant, or otherwise explore their creativity, with a theme for each year, and various divisions. As many as four generations of family have participated in the parade. The parade is referenced in numerous books.
History.
In 1911, the Salinas Rodeo, then known as the Wild West Show, was held at the Sherwood Park at the race track. It lasted a week, thus the name, "Big Week". During this era, the Colmo del Rodeo night parade began.
In 1930, the Salinas Exchange Club promoted the first Kiddie Kapers Parade as part of the Colmo del Rodeo on Saturday night. In 1931, the Kiddie Kapers Parade was changed to the night before the opening of the Salinas Rodeo, which is its current configuration.
There was no parade from 1942 to 1945 nor 2020.
The parade is unique in that only children are allowed to participate, and every child wins a prize, including at least a $1 bill. Approximately 1200 children participate annually. Each year has a theme for the children. In 2017, the theme was "Kids Just Wanna Have Fun". Approximately 30,000 people view the parade.
Various YouTube videos now are available for the more recent parades.

Mars suit

A Mars suit or Mars space suit is a space suit for EVAs on the planet Mars. Compared to a suit designed for space-walking in the near vacuum of low Earth orbit, Mars suits have a greater focus on actual walking and a need for abrasion resistance. Mars' surface gravity is 37.8% of Earth's, approximately 2.3 times that of the Moon, so weight is a significant concern, but there are fewer thermal demands compared to open space. At the surface the suits would contend with the atmosphere of Mars, which has a pressure of about . On the surface, radiation exposure is a concern, especially solar flare events, which can dramatically increase the amount of radiation over a short time.
Some of the issues a Mars suit for surface operations would face include having enough oxygen for the person as the air is mostly carbon dioxide; in addition the air is also at a much lower pressure than Earth's atmosphere at sea level. Other issues include the Martian dust, low temperatures, and radiation.
Overview.
One design for a Mars suit from the 2010s, the NASA Z-2 suit, would have electroluminescent patches to help crew members identify one another. Three types of tests planned for the Z-2 include tests in a vacuum chamber, tests in NASA's Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory (a large pool for mimicking zero-g), and tests in a rocky desert area. (See also: Z series space suits.)
The planned Mars 2020 rover has a materials test that is hoped will aid Mars suit development, the SHERLOC experiment; it includes a test target with space suit materials. The test will measure how these suit materials are affected by the Martian environment. Six materials have been chosen for testing: Orthofabric, Teflon, nGimat-coated Teflon, Dacron, Vectran, and Polycarbonate. The test will help select the best materials for future Mars space suits. Orthofabric is a polymeric material composed of a weave of GORE-TEX fibers, Nomex, and Kevlar-29.
NASA tested possible Mars space suit materials by exposing them to Mars-equivalent ultraviolet (UV) radiation for 2500 hours, and then studied how the materials were affected. One of the concerns for the Mars suits is how materials respond to chemically reactive Mars dust and exposure to ultraviolet, especially over the lengths of time and amount of use the suits are expected to function.
One researcher working on a design for Mars surface EVA suits was inspired in part by Medieval armor suits. Some ideas for a Mars suits are a Heads-up display projected in the visor, built-in communications equipment, life support, and a voice-recognition assistant.
Examples of design concerns:
One Mars mission design aspect is whether the Mars suits should also be made to work in space, or should be for the surface only.
Designs.
The Biosuit is a mechanical counterpressure suit, resulting in a body hugging form. In this type of suit, the pressure would come from the structure and elasticity of the material, whereas with prior space-worn suits the pressure comes from pressurized gas, like a filled balloon. The gas pressure can make a flexible suit very rigid, like an inflated balloon.
The Aoudo suit by the Austrian Space Forum is a space suit simulator for planetary surfaces. The suit ventilates with ambient air, but has a host of features to help simulate a space suit as well as tests enhancing technologies like a heads-up display inside the helmet.
The AX-5 was part of a line of hard-suits developed at NASA Ames. Current suits are either soft or hybrid suits and use a lower-pressure pure oxygen atmosphere, which means people going on EVA must pre-breathe oxygen to avoid getting decompression sickness. A hard-suit can use a high-pressure atmosphere, eliminating the need to pre-breathe, but without being too hard to move like a high pressure soft suit would be.
A simulated Mars suit was used for the HI-SEAS Earth-based spaceflight analog tests of the 2010s in Hawaii, USA.
Mars suit design has been used as a topic for technology education.
Comparison to Apollo lunar suit.
The Apollo lunar EVA suit was called the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Besides the pressure suit, this included the Portable Life Support System (backpack) and an emergency Oxygen Purge System (OPS) which provided 30 minutes of oxygen for emergency. The combined system weighed 212 pounds on Earth, but only 35.1 pounds on the Moon.
Environmental design requirements.
The most critical factors for immediate survivability and comfort on the Martian surface are to provide: sufficient pressure to prevent the boiling of body fluids; supply of oxygen and removal of carbon dioxide and water vapor for breathing; temperature control; and protection from cosmic radiation.
Pressure.
The atmospheric pressure on Mars varies with elevation and seasons, but there is not enough pressure to sustain life without a pressure suit. The lowest pressure the human body can tolerate, known as the Armstrong limit, is the pressure at which water boils (vaporizes) at the temperature of a human body, which is about . The average pressure on Mars has been measured to be only about one-tenth of this, . The highest pressure, at the lowest elevation, the bottom of Hellas Basin, is , about twice the average. There is a seasonal variation over the Martian year (about two Earth years) as carbon dioxide (95.9% of the atmosphere) is sequentially frozen out, then sublimated back into the atmosphere when it is warmer, causing a global rise and fall in pressure.
But the Martian atmosphere contains only 0.13–0.14% oxygen, compared to 20.9% of Earth's atmosphere. Thus breathing the Martian atmosphere is impossible; oxygen must be supplied, at a pressure in excess of the Armstrong limit.
Breathing.
Humans take in oxygen and expel carbon dioxide and water vapor when they breathe, and typically breathe between 12 and 20 times per minute at rest and up to 45 times per minute under high activity. At standard sea level conditions on Earth of , humans are breathing in 20.9% oxygen, at a partial pressure of . This is the required oxygen supply corresponding to normal Earth conditions. Humans generally require supplemental oxygen at altitudes above , so the absolute minimum safe oxygen requirement is a partial pressure of For reference, the Apollo EMU used an operating pressure of on the Moon.
Exhaled breath on Earth normally contains about 4% carbon dioxide and 16% oxygen, along with 78% nitrogen, plus about 0.2 to 0.3 liters of water. Carbon dioxide slowly becomes increasingly toxic in high concentrations, and must be scrubbed from the breathing gas. A concept to scrub carbon dioxide from breathing air is to use re-usable amine bead carbon dioxide scrubbers. While one carbon dioxide scrubber filters the astronaut's air, the other can vent scrubbed carbon dioxide to the Mars atmosphere. Once that process is completed, another scrubber can be used, and the one that was used can take a break. Another more traditional way to remove carbon dioxide from air is by a lithium hydroxide canister, however these need to be replaced periodically. Carbon dioxide removal systems are a standard part of habitable spacecraft designs, although their specifics vary. One idea to remove carbon dioxide is to use a zeolite molecular sieve, and then later the carbon dioxide can be removed from the material.
If nitrogen is used to increase pressure as on the ISS, it is inert to humans, but can cause decompression sickness. Space suits typically operate at low pressure to make their balloon-like structure easier to move, so astronauts must spend a long time getting the nitrogen out of their system. The Apollo missions used a pure oxygen atmosphere in space except on the ground, to reduce risk of fire. There is also interest in hard suits that can handle higher internal pressures but are more flexible, so astronauts do not have to get the nitrogen out of their system before going on a spacewalk.
Temperature.
There can be large temperature swings on Mars; for example, at the equator, daytime temperature may reach in the Martian summer, and drop down to at night. According to a 1958 NASA report, long-term human comfort requires temperatures in the range at 50% humidity.
Radiation.
On Earth, in developed nations, humans are exposed to about 0.6 rads (6 mGy) per year, and aboard the International Space Station about 8 rads (80 mGy) per year. Humans can tolerate up to about 200 rads (2 Gy) of radiation without incurring permanent damage, however any radiation exposure carries risk so there is a focus on keeping exposure as low as possible. On the surface of Mars there are two main types of radiation: A steady dose from a variety of sources and solar proton events that can cause a dramatic increase in the amount of radiation for a short time. Solar flare events can cause a lethal dose to be delivered in hours if astronauts are caught unprotected, and this is a concern of NASA for human operations in space and on the surface of Mars. Mars does not have a large magnetic field in the same way as Earth, which shields the Earth from radiation, especially from solar flares. For example, the solar event which occurred on , just 5 months after Apollo 16, produced so much radiation, including a wave of accelerated particles like protons, that NASA became concerned what would happen if such an event were to occur while astronauts were in space. If the astronauts get too much radiation, it increases their lifetime cancer risk and they can get radiation poisoning. Exposure to ionizing radiation can also cause cataracts, a problem with the eye.
The atmosphere of Mars is much thinner than Earth's, so it does not stop as much radiation.
The effect of radiation on medications taken on the mission is also of concern, especially if it alters their medical qualities.
Additional design requirements.
Operating in Mars suit on the surface creates a series of concerns for the human body, including an altered gravitational environment, a confined and isolated situation, a hostile exterior environment and closed environment inside, radiation, and extreme distance from Earth.
An important consideration for the breathing air inside the suit, is that toxic gases do not get into the air supply. Reduced gravity environments can alter the distribution of fluids inside the body. One point of concern is changes in fine motor skill, especially if it interferes with the ability to use computer interfaces.
Visors and UV.
A thin layer of gold on the visor plastic bubble of current space helmets, shields the face from harmful parts of the Sun's spectrum. Visor designs, in general, have a design goal of allowing the astronaut to see, but block ultraviolet and heat, besides the pressure requirements.
It has been detected that ultraviolet light does reach the surface of Mars. Martian carbon dioxide tends to block ultraviolet light of wavelengths shorter than about 190 nm, however above that there is less blocking depending on the amount of dust and Rayleigh scattering. Significant amounts of UVB and UVC light are noted to reach the surface of Mars.
Toilet and vomiting.
A human consideration for suits is the need to go the bathroom. Various methods have been employed in suits, and in the Shuttle-era NASA used maximum absorbency garments to enable stays of 10 hours in space and partial pressure suits.
Another concern is vomiting, which has increased occurrence in spaceflight.
Martian dust.
Another consideration is what would happen if astronauts somehow breathe in Mars dust. The health effect of Mars dust is a concern, based on known information about it which includes that it may be abrasive and/or reactive. Studies have been done with quartz dust and also compared it to lunar dust exposure. An Apollo 17 astronaut complained of hay fever like symptoms after his Moon walk. The lunar dust was known to cling to the space suits and be taken in with the astronauts when they came in to the Apollo Lunar Module.
Use.
An article in the magazine "Nature" noted that due to the reduced gravity, the dynamics of walking on Mars would be different than on Earth. This is because people fall forward as part of their gait when moving, the motion of the center of body mass resembling that of an inverted pendulum. Compared to the Earth, all else being equal it would be half the amount of work to move, however a walking speed on Mars would be 3.4 km per hour rather than 5.5 km per hour on Earth. This data was produced by simulating Martian gravity for the duration of an aircraft following a flight profile that causes this type of acceleration. The acceleration of gravity at the surface of Mars is calculated to be about 3.7 meters per second2. It is not known if this reduced gravity causes the same kind of reduced muscle mass and biological effects as seen when living in microgravity aboard the ISS for several months. The gravity is about 38% of Earth's gravity at the surface.
Rock climbing tests with a low-pressure IVA (intra vehicle activity) suit were conducted in Oregon, USA. The difficulty of grasping rock with gloves including moving fingers and gaining friction with rocks was noted, and ice climbing axes were helpful for climbing surfaces. Mountaineering on Mars may be needed when the terrain environments exceeds the abilities of a rover vehicle, or to access a target of interest, or simply to get home to a base. One common mountaineering need is a highly mobile short-stay shelter to use for overnight stays when climbing, such as a tent, and an equivalent for Mars might support the ability to get out of a space suit. Suit design for climbing would likely be impacted by the needs for climbing including suit flexibility, especially in the hands and also in terms of durability.
Another issue is the expected amount of use for the suits in probably human mission designs. For example, as of the late 2010s there had been over 500 EVA's from the start of spaceflight, whereas a single mission to Mars is expected to need 1000 EVAs.
Typical Mars mission plans note that a person wearing a Mars suit would need to enter a pressurized rover through an airlock. Alternatively, a Mars suit would need to be worn on crewed unpressurized rovers to provide life support. There are several different options for an egress and entry airlock for a space suit, and one of these is to repressurize the entire compartment as on the Apollo lunar lander. Some other ideas are suitport, crewlock, and transit airlock.
Need.
The NASA Authorization Act of 2017 directed NASA to get humans near or on the surface of Mars by the early 2030s.
Suitport for Mars.
Mars space suits have been explored for integration with airlock design that combines an airlock and suit entry and egress with another vehicle, and is commonly known as a suitport. This has been considered as a way to integrate a crewed pressurized Mars rover with Mars space suit EVAs.
The idea is that a person would slide into the suit through an airlock opening while the exterior of suit is outside the vehicle and exposed to the Martian environment. Then, the hatch would be closed, sealing off the interior of the vehicle, and the person would be supported by the suit's life support system. NASA tested the Z-1 space suit for extraterrestrial surface EVA with a suitport design in the 2010s. In the NASA Z-1 design there is a hatch at the rear of the space suit that can be docked with a suitable vehicle or structure.

Bour de Breteuil

Bour de Breteuil was a Mercenary captain of the Hundred Years War.
He was an illegitimate son of the house of Lesparre, from Gironde. The Lesparre were a very powerful noble family in southern France. Due to his station in 13th century society, he became a mercenary captain.
However, after the Treaty of Brétigny was signed on May 8, 1360, he found himself unemployed and so turned to Brigandry, ranging the French country side pillaging towns.
Bour de Breteuil fought at the battle of Brignais (6 April 1362) against the King of France in which a coalition of bandit companies were successful. Like the Bour Camus, he accompanied several of the bandit leaders including John Hawkwood, John Creswey and Robert Briquet, to accept a payment of gold from the king of France to go into Italy, where he gained employ as a mercenary.

<doc id="56677811" url="?curid=56677811" title="James G. Taliaferro">
James G. Taliaferro

James Govan Taliaferro (September 28, 1798 – October 13, 1876) was a lawyer, newspaper publisher, and judge in Louisiana. In 1860 he owned 27 slaves and a plantation valued at $87,000. As the secession movement grew he remained a staunch Unionist and was held for some time in a Confederate prison during the American Civil War. A Whig, he later joined the Republican Party and was an outspoken opponent of secession. He was an opponent of the Thirteenth Amendment that abolished slavery and ran for Lieutenant Governor in 1865 on a platform against Black suffrage. He remained active in Republican Party politics during the Reconstruction Era and was a candidate for governor in 1868 with the backing of Louis Charles Roudanez and his African American newspaper. He ran for governor with running mate Francis Ernest Dumas, an "almost white" Union officer and former slaveholder. They lost to Henry C. Warmoth a Civil War veteran officer from the North who ended up undermining civil rights legislation and being removed from office for election corruption in 1872. His family papers are at Louisiana State University.
Taliaferro was born to Zacharias Taliaferro and Sally Warwick on September 28, 1798 in Amherst, Virginia. The family moved to Claiborne County, Mississippi in 1806 and then to Catahoula Parish, Louisiana in 1815.
Early years.
Taliaferro graduated from Transylvania College in Lexington, Kentucky. He married Elizabeth M.B. Williamson of Lexington in 1819. Taliaferro became a lawyer in Harrisonburg, Louisiana and served as a judge in Catahoula Parish. He was Parish Judge from 1834 until 1847.
Taliaferro published the "Harrisonburg Independent" for several years from about 1856 until 1861. He represented Catahoula Parish in the constitutional convention of 1852.
Secession and Civil War years.
In 1861 he was representative at the secession convention where he was a strong opponent and refused to sign on. As a delegate to the Louisiana state secessionist convention from Catahoula Parish, he argued strongly against leaving the American Union. Taliaferro "denied the constitutional right [of a state] to leave the Union and painted a gloomy picture of economic chaos, blighted prosperity, staggering taxation and 'fatal prostration of Louisiana's interests under a southern Confederation,' and he could see no way ahead to prevent final anarchy and war. So 'radical' were the ideas of Taliaferro that the convention refused to print his protest in the pages of [its journal]." In a speech to the convention, he said:
Two of his sons served in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Post-war career.
Taliaferro was later appointed by Governor James Madison Wells to serve as an associate justice on the Louisiana Supreme Court, remaining in that office from 1866 until 1876, and was a delegate to the Louisiana Constitutional Convention 1868. He ran for governor but another Republican candidate was chosen. He died in Harrisonburg, Louisiana October 13, 1876. He is buried along with his wife in Alexander Cemetery in Manifest, Louisiana, Catahoula Parish.
At the secession convention he said:
"Sir, I am behind no man in attachment to Louisiana. I am unable to see that higher and grander position which gentlemen say Louisiana is to assume by the act of secession. Clouds and darkness rather, are before me. The dimness of age, perhaps, prevents me from penetrating the gloom and seeing the bright skies and green fields beyond. In the exercise of my best judgment, and under my honest convictions of the ruinous tendency of this measure, I must pronounce it an act of madness and of folly. Sir, I vote Nay."
Taliaferro had many children, several died young.

Route 440 begins at the westernmost edge of Corner Brook at an interchange with Route 1 (Trans-Canada Highway, Exit 7). It heads west along the banks of the Humber River for a couple of kilometres to a small neighbourhood, where it makes a sharp right turn to cross the river at an intersection with Riverside Drive. The highway heads north past a private RV Park and a large cemetery before leaving Corner Brook and winding its way through the Long Range Mountains to pass through Hughes Brook (where it crosses the river of the same name). Route 440 now passes along the northern coastline of the Humber Arm as it passes through Irishtown-Summerside, Meadows, Gillams, and McIvers. The highway turns northeast through inland terrain for several kilometres to enter Cox's Cove, where Route 440 comes to an end along the coastline of the Bay of Islands at a Y-Intersection with Main Street.

Polyommatus damone

Polyommatus damone is a butterfly found in the Palearctic that belongs to the blues family.
Description from Seitz.
L. damone Ev. (81 h). At once distinguished from "damon" by the quite different tint of the blue in the male: the name-typical form, moreover, has a narrow black border. The white mesial streak of the hindwing beneath is either absent or present, but in the latter case is mostly much less conspicuous, diffuse, obsolescent or shortened. Female above dark brown, usually with obsolescent reddish yellow submarginal spots on the hindwing. In the southern Ural. ab. "damocles" H.-Schaff. [now full species] is a rare aberration whose male is smaller, very bright sky-blue bearing on the thin black border of the hindwing dark triangles resembling diffuse marginal dots. — "damonides" Stgr. (81 h, i) [now full species] from Transcaucasia and Persia (e. g. at Shahrud) is larger, darker above and beneath, the ground-colour of the underside being dark chocolate-brown : the white mesial streak, though prominent, is thinner and shorter. — "sibirica" Stgr. (= altaica Elw. from the Altai, is smaller and has the base of the wings more brightly dusted with blue beneath. — "carmon" H.- Schaff.[now full species] (="kindermanni" Led., "alpestris" Frr., "eurypilus" Gerh.) (81 i) is much smaller than all the other forms of "damone"; the male bright cyaneous blue with broad black border to the forewing. From Asia Minor (Taurus), Armenia and Persia. — "transcaspica" Stgr. [now full species] is lighter blue above and darker brown beneath: from Turkestan. — In "cyanea" Stgr.[now full species] the male has nearly the same colour as the male of "icarus", with distinctly black veins and thin black border; the costal area is a lighter blue and contrasts with the rest of the wing. Armenia. — "xerxes"Stgr. ["cyanea" ssp.] , from Shahrud in Persia, is still smaller, the underside paler with the mesial streak entirely obsolete or nearly. — "iphigenia" H.-Schaff. (81 i) [now full species] is again similar to "damon", above more greenish blue, with broad black border, the costal and apical areas of the hindwing also being black. The underside is paler and has smaller ocelli. Asia Minor and Persia. — "iphidamon" Stgr. (81 i) [now full species] is somewhat larger than the preceding form and the dark border is deeper black: from the Taurus, Kurdistan and Persia. — "juldusa" Stgr. (= "iphigenia" Alph.) [now full species] (82 a) is more greenish blue above, the black scaling so extends from the black border over the blue ground that the border gradually fades away. From the Tian-shan. According to Alpheraky very local and flying about a low plant with blue flowers. — "iphigenides" [now full species] ("melania" Gr.-Grsh. ) 82a Much larger than "juldusa" above very similar to "iphigenia", but both sexes beneath with yellowish red marginal spots on the hindwing. Turkestan. — "melania" Stgr.[now full species] Upperside of male more green, with very broad border; the underside yellowish grey, with larger ocelli and yellowish red submarginal spots on both wings: from the Pamir. — The butterflies of this species are always local, some races appearing to have a very restricted distribution. They fly in May and June, particularly in desolate stony places where "Oxytropis" grows, and occur up to 10 000 ft.
Biology.
The larva feeds on "Onobrychis arenaria", "Hedysarum candidum", "H. biebersteinii", "H. cretaceum", "H. grandiflorum", "H. argyrophyllum"

Huxtable Ranch Headquarters District

The Huxtable Ranch Ranch Headquarters District, also known as White Creek Ranch, comprises a complex of ranch structures in Converse County, Wyoming. It was part of a dispersed community known as Boxelder, established by settlers in the 1880s. The ranch was established in 1893 by Charles Smith who built a one-room and later a three-room cabin on the property, as well as a barn. Three years later he sold the homestead to Willard Heber White. White and his wife lived on the ranch until 1928 when they moved to Douglas. On White's death in 1929, the ranch was purchased by Lloyd Huxtable and Charlie Olin. Lloyd and Olin built the present ranch house for Charlie and his wife Najima, Olin's sister, from 1933 to 1935. The Huxtables operated the ranch until his death at 86 in 1976. Huxtable served as a Converse County Commissioner from 1948 to 1956.
Description.
Structures on the ranch include the main ranch house, a garage, a house trailer, a stock shed, a laundry house/office, a shop and barns for chickens, horses and cows. The log house was built in 1933–35, measuring about by , and is built in a rustic Craftsman style with a prominent rubble stone foundation. The stock shed was built in the early 1940s. The wood frame shop was built on a foundation dated to 1944. The horse and cow barns are frame structures dating to Willard White's ownership. The ranch is located along Boxelder Creek at an altitude of between and . The historic district comprises the core of the ranch and is in extent.
The Huxtable Ranch Headquarters District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in on April 17, 2011.

Robert Wood (television executive)

Robert Dennis Wood (April 17, 1925 – May 20, 1986) was an American television executive from Boise, Idaho who was president of CBS from 1969 to 1976. He, along with his vice president Fred Silverman, initiated the network's "rural purge" in the early 1970s, which influenced much of American television at the time. The purge canceled long-running and popular rural-oriented shows like "Green Acres" and "The Beverly Hillbillies" in order to introduce more urban-oriented shows targeted at the youth market, such as "All in the Family", which reshaped American television by depicting issues previously considered unsuitable for a U.S. network television comedy.
He died in Santa Monica, California.

Barhapple Loch

Barhapple Loch is a small semicircular freshwater loch located in Wigtownshire, Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland. Barhapple Loch is principally known for the discovery of a Crannog in 1878 on the loch, when it was drained.
Settlements.
Glenluce is the largest settlement in the area, and is located 3.9 miles from the loch in a southwesterly direction. Newton Stewart is around 10 miles to the northeast, along the A75 road.
Geography.
Barhapple Loch is located 4 miles (6.5 km) east of Glenluce. It is of glacial origin, of the Kettle hole type. To the south of the loch, is Derskelpin Farm. Slightly east of the farm is Dernaglar Loch. To the southwest is Dirlaughlin Hill at 114m and Knock Moss. To the east is Barhapple hill at 107m. To the east and north is Mark of Luce Moss.
Discovery of Crannog.
Barhapple Loch is only a few feet deep and surrounded by a deep peat bog, except on the east side, where it touched Barhapple hill, and rested on a bottom of soft peat. The black colour of the water and the inaccessible nature of the shore on the west side, precluded the discovery of any loch dwellings. In 1842, while James McCulloch was cutting peat, about 40 yards from the west side of the loch, he came upon a circle of stakes, numbering around 12. Ranging from thickness of a man's leg to a man's arm, and made of Hazel, they were about 5 feet long, with the heads two feet below the level of the ground. The circle was around 5 feet in diameter. During the autumn of 1978, the loch was drained, and in November, the tenant of the farm noticed a small round patch of logs that had become visible.
Exploration.
On 15 October 1880, a party was formed and lead by the John Dalrymple, Earl of Stair to explore the crannog. Among the party of eight was Sir John Dalrymple-Hay, 3rd Baronet. The digging was stopped at a depth of between two and three feet by the appearance of water, but which point several discoveries were made. It was reported, that the loch-dwelling consisted of mainly oak piles and a platform of wood, with rough stone at some point. The discovery was located some 280 feet from the shore, with a gangway built from the east shore from the foot of Barhapple, where it is hard ground, at a length of 550 feet to facilitate viewing. The discovery was a row of oak piles, enclosing a space of 175 feet long from north to south and 127 feet wide, with rounded angles. Sir Herbert Maxwell took the first measurements of what remained of the crannog. 134 piles were visible, with a slight gap on the west side and larger one on the south side, with the piles on each side thingly set. It is surrounded by a row of oak piles, enclosing a space 175 feet long from north to south, and 127 feet broad, and rounded at the angles. The crannog appeared to be connected to the N and E shores of the loch by gangways on piles. A ring of Cannel coal of around 5.68 cm was discovered during the excavations. In 1884 a further excavation was undertaken. Some of the logs had rotted away, and others were pierced through by the shoots of the marsh plants, which gradually covered the partially drained area.
The crannog were surveyed in July 2002, during the 2nd phase of the South-West Scotland Crannog Survey, with the intention of establishing an effective system of monitoring the rate of organic decay. Many of the timbers have a spongy consistency and with the shallow depth of the loch and changing levels, means they are unlikely to survive, with ongoing monitoring of the site being recommended. It was estimated that 3000 trees had been used to build the crannog. The frequent occurrences of the syllables "der", "dir" and "dar" in the places near Barhapple indicate that they were heavily wooded by trees, long ago. A topographic rhyme, passed down the centuries and told to the narrator Robert Munro by the farmer Thomas McCormick of Mindork, in Kirkowan, 1 mile to the east of Barhapple Loch. It states:
An underwater survey was conducted as part of the Survey. Further surveys were conducted in 2003 and 2004 as part of the South-West Scotland Crannog Survey. There has been 4 other lochs in Old Luce parish with crannogs.
Fauna.
The north side of the loch is covered by a dense association of Phragmites Communis. On the west side, there is a considerable coverage of marsh, dominated by Carex rostrata and C filiformis. On the east shore it is gravelly and peaty. On the south side plants including Juncus bufonius, Juncus supinus and Peplis portula. There are few mosses or hepatics on the shores.

He graduated with a BSc. in biology from the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia in 1956 and then moved to Louisiana State University where he obtained his master's degree two years later. His dissertation was on "The foraging behavior of ant-tanagers in British Honduras".
He was awarded a doctorate in zoology from the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. His dissertation on "The Behavior of Bicolored Antbirds" was published by the university as a monograph. He then held a postdoctoral position at the American Museum of Natural History for a year.
Willis married the ornithologist and entomologist Yoshika Oniki in 1970. In 1982 he was appointed to a faculty position at the São Paulo State University (Universidade Estadual Paulista) in Rio Claro, Brazil, where he taught until his retirement in 2005. He died on the 11 April 2015 in Rio Claro, São Paulo, Brazil.
During his career Willis published nearly 300 scientific articles and books. Some of these were written in Portuguese. Many were co-authored with his wife. Between 1966 and 1986, he wrote more than 30 papers on ant followers: these are bird species that feed on insects and other arthropods that are flushed by swarms of army ants.
In recognition of his many contributions to ornithology, when in 1997 a subspecies of the dusky antbird ("Cercomacra tyrannina laeta") was promoted to species status, it was named "Willis's antbird". His name is also used for a subspecies of the red-throated ant tanager ("Habia fuscicauda willisi"). The common scale-backed antbird had traditionally been placed in the genus "Hylophylax" based on the morphology but a 2007 molecular study found that it was not closely related to the other members of the genus. The common scale-backed antbird was moved to a new genus "Willisornis", a name chosen by the Brazilian ornithologists Carlos Agne and José Fernando Pacheco to honour Willis.

Hotel Sofitel Tokyo

Hotel Sofitel Tokyo (ホテルソフィテル東京) was a hotel high-rise building (106.07 m, 3 underground storeys) in Taito-ku, Tokyo (1-48, 2 Ikenohata, Taito-ku, Tokyo, Japan). It was established in 1994 as Hotel Cosima with 71 rooms on 26 cantilever floors. In 1999 it was purchased by Accor Group. After refurbishment (number of rooms increased to 83) it was reopened as 4-star hotel in September 2000, closed in December 2006 and was demolished between February 2007 and May 2008.
Hotel Sofitel was a late work of Japanese architect Kiyonori Kikutake (66 years old, when the building was conceived), best known for his own pre-metabolist house (Sky House), and Edo-Tokyo Museum(1993). Hotel Sofitel building resembled some metabolist ideas (as Joint Core, capsules, modularity, and - theoretically - possibility of replacement of its parts). The building shows a direct similarity to Kiyonori Kikutake's earlier theoretical project "Tree-shaped Community" from 1968. However, this project consisted of a group of towers cross-shaped in plan, it shows also similarity to other metabolists projects (Nakagin Capsule Tower by Kisho Kurokawa, Shizuoka Press and Broadcasting Tower by Kenzo Tange).
It is said that the characteristic shape of the hotel building was inspired by shapes Japanese temples and pine trees. Despite some metabolist-like features the object itself cannot be seen as representative of metabolist movement - as designed long after the slow breakup of the metabolists group in late 70. of XXc. The object referenced traditional Japanese architecture, what is characteristic for mature and late works of K.Kikutake (Edo-Tokyo Museum, Izumo Grand Shrine Administration Building, Toukouen Hotel).

After the formation Soviet Union, Armenians became big contributors to the social and political life of Uzbekistan. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, many Armenians moved to mainly to Russia, Armenia and the United States. Remaining Armenians in Uzbekistan keep their religious traditions. There are two active Armenian Churches in Uzbekistan, in Samarkand and Tashkent. but during the Soviet Union era it was closed and in 1995 a Businessman from Samarqand of an Armenian Origin - Artur Martirosyan, donated to re-construct and re-open the Church..

<doc id="56678278" url="?curid=56678278" title="Tschabalala Self">
Tschabalala Self

Tschabalala Self (born 1990) is an American artist best known for her depictions of Black female figures using paint, fabric, and discarded pieces of her previous works. Though she uses mixed media, all of her works are on canvas and employ a "painting language." Inspired by works done by an African-American artist, Romare Bearden, Tschabalala Self creates collages of various items that she has collected over time and sews them together to depict black female bodies that "defy the narrow spaces in which they are forced to exist", which she derives from the history behind the African-American struggle and oppression in society. Self reclaims the black female body and portrays them to be free of stereotypes without having to fear being punished. Her goal is to "create alternative narratives around the black body". Much of Self's work uses elements from black culture to construct quilt-like portraits.
Early life.
Self was born in 1990 in Harlem.
Education.
After graduating from Bard College with a B.A. in 2012, Self completed her M.F.A. in painting and printmaking at the Yale School of Art. Self has also held residencies at the American Academy in Rome, the La Brea Studio, T293 in Naples, Italy, and Red Bull House of Art in Detroit.
Career.
Self's first solo show was in 2015 at Schur-Narula in Berlin. In a review of a solo show at Thierry Goldberg gallery in New York in 2016, "The New York Times" declared, "Ms. Self’s work has great promise, which she is developing." Peter Schjeldahl compared her piece at the New Museum's 2017 "Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon" to the works of Arshile Gorky and Willem de Kooning. Self's work has also been featured in a solo exhibition at the Parasol unit foundation for contemporary art in London. Self's work is in the permanent collection of Hammer Museum, Los Angeles, California; Perez Art Museum Miami, Miami, Florida; Rubell Family Collection, Miami, Florida, and the JP Morgan Chase Art Collection.
Artistic style.
Self has said, "I use materials in an unconventional way to subvert the status quo. You don’t have to use paint to make a painting. It aligns with my overall message, which is one of change." The use of unconventional materials help to highlight the unique shapes of a body because it separates the emphasis of each part from the whole structure of the artwork and creates an individual space for the pieces to express rather than to perform for the audience. Self starts her artwork with a line drawing of the character she wants to illustrate, then takes different objects to create her collage of items to go over that drawing. She uses shapes to build her characters while emphasizing objects or parts of the body that might be noticed first or carry a psychological or physical weight to them.
Several of Self's works are sexually explicit. Self’s "Rainbow" piece, which consists of wood, acrylic paint, and other elements, portrays a black woman bending down, exposing her genitalia. Another of Self’s work "Swim" involves a man and woman joined together in a sexual act while still displaying certain parts of the body that hold more emphasis, in particular, the buttocks. The black female bodies in her artwork are often described as nonbinary or "genderless" because they do not conform to the westernized form of beauty that is usually seen in the art world.
Tschabalala Self's art style revolves around the representation of black women through primary (genitalia) and secondary (body changes/ features) sexual characteristics by painting and utilizing printmaking. In developing her characters, Self exclaims, "The images all start from a drawing. And from that drawing I try to build a body or build the features of the subject I’m creating… I think that they are really sincerely built bit by bit.", the body is made up of several different yet crucial parts which makes the body exaggerations in people complex with layers of racial discrimination and prejudice following along stigmas. Through her art, Self comments upon the normalization and objectification of the
body with a romanticized perspective. The characters illustrated in her artworks all share exaggerated body and facial features, and in doing so, allude to a racial and generational trauma embedded within each painting. The people in her artwork are made from different textures and prints of clothing which emphasize and direct the attention of the audience towards the most significant part in her artwork. Her particular artistic style gravitates towards black women embracing independence and resilience leaving a strong and fierce presence. Self’s approach is most commonly androgynous and does not solely reference one gender.
Works.
One of Self's most prominent works, "The Function", sheds light into the social aspect of the art piece and explains the abstract nature of the figure and its background. Tschabalala states in an interview, “A stereotype is a flat character with two dimensions. And I can confront those stereotypical images by making round, multidimensional characters with complicated desires, inner dialogues, and psychology." The art piece is created by patching together pieces of old paintings, raw canvas, and fabrics which are assembled by stretching, painting and drawing over them. This gives the avatar a greater sense of dimension as it highlights the dynamic motion of turning one’s back indicated by the creased fabric.
Furthermore, Self said in an interview, "My work does not comment on stereotypes and generalizations about the black female body, my practice absorbs these fantasies. The work is celebratory because one must thrive despite destructive rhetoric."
"Bodega Run".
Through her project of a series called "Bodega Run", Self explores how bodies are affected by their environment, which also impacts the way the bodies move through the world itself. Bodegas are small grocery stores, or also known as liquor stores, that are commonly found on the east coast of America, specifically New York. Self’s inspiration for this project stems from her hometown of Harlem, where bodegas were and are very common. Self, along with many others, believes that bodegas are a place where communities come together that share mutual issues, such as the issue of the oppression of people of color in America. Her Bodega project stems from this belief and her "characters populating the bodegas of Harlem, these groceries of the corner, true microcosms emblems of the black and Latin diasporas in New York". Part of this series is her works she calls Hammer Projects include "Rainbow, Big Red, My Guy, Ice Cream," and "Loosie in the Park." Self also includes neon light signs, consisting of words such as “Abierto/ Open”, “Coffee/ Teas”, “EBT/ ATM”, and “Lotto”, which represent the LED lights that typically reside in these facilities. As Self has noted in conversation with Jareh Das for "Ocula" magazine, 'The bodega is an infinitely interesting locale and institution for the various racial, ethnic, and social dynamics at play within these spaces. The mere existence of these stores is deeply radicalized, given the fact that bodegas occupy neighborhoods that are generally defined as food deserts.'
"Cotton Mouth".
The body of work presented by Tschabalala Self in her exhibition Cotton Mouth embodies the extraordinary experience of Black American life by connecting Black America’s past to contemporary culture. She does this through the use of “elements in dyed canvas, craft paper, and fabric” in conjunction with other mediums. Self reveals the idea behind the name of this exhibition, explaining that, “Cotton mouth is when you can’t speak with ease, or are coerced into sticking to a script that you didn’t write. Cotton mouth is the reality that you’re in, because of repeated damage”. The choice of title is a burdened one, as a mouth that can no longer function serves as a metaphor for the systemic and continued silencing of Black Americans. Self’s work allows the viewer to contemplate the cultural and historical significance of the labor and sacrifice required of Black Americans to produce cotton itself during the 19th century. Some of Self’s exhibition of paintings, drawings, sculptures and an audio piece in her series Cotton Mouth are known as Spat, Sprewell, Carpet, Nate the Snake, Pocket Rocket, Fast Girl, Lil Mama 2, as well as Loveseat 1, 2, and 3 which are featured in Galerie Eva Presenhuber in New York.
Recognition.
Self has been named to "Forbes" "30 Under 30 List". She has also been recognized as a Joan Mitchell Foundation Painters &amp; Sculptors Grant recipient.
Personal life.
Self currently lives in New Haven, Connecticut.

Freedom Online Coalition

The Freedom Online Coalition is a group of 32 governments that work together to advance Internet freedom, mainly through shaping global norms through Joint Statements, multistakeholder engagement with their Advisory Network and through coordinating diplomatic initiatives and interventions at relevant international forums. The Freedom Online Coalition was launched at a conference of the Dutch Government in The Hague, the Netherlands in December 2011.
Participating countries commit to "promoting the freedoms of expression, association, and peaceful assembly with respect to the Internet and connection technologies". They endorse the principle that the human rights that people have offline should enjoy the same protection online, including freedom of assembly and the right to organize and the right to be protected from "arbitrary" intrusions into their privacy. Its work builds on the resolution on "The Promotion, Protection and Enjoyment of Human Rights on the Internet" adopted by United Nations Human Rights Council in July 2012. The coalition has also endorsed a set of recommendations for cybersecurity policy making that respects human rights as well as a definition of cybersecurity.
The group has held annual meetings in The Netherlands (2011), Kenya (2012), Tunisia (2013), Estonia (2014), Mongolia (2015), Costa Rica (2016), Germany (2018), and Ghana (2020). The group has 32 member countries (2019). In 2019, the Chairship of the Freedom Online Coalition is held by the Government of Ghana and the chairing advisors are Bernard Shen, Microsoft and Mallory Knodel, Center for Democracy and Technology (formerly representing ARTICLE 19).

Charles Legéndy

Charles Rudolf Legéndy (Hungarian: Legéndy Károly Rudolf, born November 2, 1936), is a Hungarian-born American engineer, theoretical physicist, and neuroscientist.
In physics, Legéndy is known for his theoretical work on the helicon phenomenon, In neuroscience, he is known for introducing the "Poisson surprise" test used for burst detection in neuronal spike trains, and for his calculations of brain capacity.
Biography.
Legéndy began his university studies at the Budapest University of Technology (Müegyetem). After emigrating to the United States in 1956, he obtained a bachelor's degree in engineering physics from Princeton University (1959) and a PhD in theoretical physics from Cornell University (1964).
In his postdoctoral years, Legéndy switched from physics to neuroscience and took a series of research positions in the US and overseas, publishing both theoretical and experimental papers. In 1985 he lost his research funding and returned to engineering, working in aerospace design (ITT Avionics, Singer-Kearfott), and in database management, until his retirement (2001). In retirement, Legéndy joined the Psychology Department at Columbia University in an unpaid position as an adjunct researcher, and (after a 26 year hiatus in publications) resumed work in theoretical neuroscience.
While in Germany, Legéndy met his future wife Annemarie; they married in 1977, and settled down to raise their children in New York City.
Physics: helicon waves.
As a graduate student at Cornell, Legéndy joined an experimental team which had just discovered an electromagnetic resonance phenomenon at unexpectedly low frequencies (32 Hz and below) inside a metal sample in a magnetic field. Legéndy showed that the resonance was the manifestation of solid-state plasma wave propagation inside the metal, mathematically comparable to radio whistlers in the ionosphere.
Neuroscience: general design of data processing in the brain.
Legéndy’s theory of the brain develops certain additions to the Hebbian theory; in particular, to the theory of cell assemblies. He estimated the maximum number of stable cell assemblies that could fit into the network. Under the most optimistic set of assumptions available at the time, the brain model could contain up to 109 "mental entities," the figure later used by Hebb in illustrating the large capacity of the brain. (Recent data shows that the estimate must be greatly reduced; and Legéndy now believes that the large capacity of brains cannot be explained in terms of synaptic weights alone; synapse-based memory must be supplemented by a molecular backup system.)
Legéndy’s work on brain circuitry and ignitions led to the “Poisson surprise” analysis of neuronal spike trains a method of burst detection. (Poisson surprise is defined as –log P, where P is the probability of a spike pattern under the assumed baseline distribution of spiking — in this case the Poisson distribution.) The test can quickly detect and quantify bursts in neuronal spike trains; and it is used, for instance, as a way to detect loss of functionality in certain brain regions. The critique of the Poisson surprise test is that actual spike distributions differ from the Poisson distribution to varying degrees (for instance for interspike intervals smaller than the refractory period); the critique generally suggests changing the underlying probability distribution, not the principle of surprise-based burst detection. The concept of surprising events in neuronal spike trains was originally introduced on theoretical grounds, in view of the large number of unplanned contacts present in the brain which necessitate statistical methods for distinguishing the useful signals from random firing. (The connection to the cell assembly theory is through the ignition phenomenon – ignitions create surprising events at distant locations.)

Friedrich Krüger (diplomat)

Daniel Christian Friedrich Krüger was a diplomat in the service of the city state of Lübeck and also jointly of the Hanseatic cities of Lübeck, Hamburg and Bremen. He was born in Lübeck on 22 September 1819 and died in Berlin on 17 January 1896.
Early life.
Krüger was the son of a Lübeck Senator. After attending the Lübeck Gymnasium, he studied jurisprudence at the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Göttingen and completed his professional training by a long stay abroad, particularly Paris.
In 1844, Krüger became a lawyer in Lübeck and was appointed procurator in the lower court and the court of appeals. Krüger's efficiency was fully acknowledged and in 1850 the city sent him as its representative to the Erfurt Union and the following year to the Elbe Ship Navigation commission in Magdeburg. After the introduction of the new constitution of Lübeck in 1849, he became the Spokesman of the Bürgerausschuss, the Committee of the House of Burgesses.
Diplomatic service.
In 1855 he became the Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic states at Copenhagen and conducted negotiations which resulted in the abolition of the Sound Dues, which had been a tax on Lübeck’s trade out from the Baltic to the open sea. By the Copenhagen Convention in 1857 this source of revenue for Denmark was bought out by Great Britain, Russia, Lübeck and the other states trading in the Baltic.
The railway connections between the three Hanseatic city states were of special interest to him. At his instigation, Denmark agreed to a direct railway line across its territory in Holstein from Lübeck to Hamburg. Already in Copenhagen, he had successfully represented Hamburg's interest in the construction of a railway connecting this town to Altona (in Holstein) and concluded an agreement with the Danish government in 1860.
Hanseatic representative to the German Confederation.
The Second Schleswig War of 1864 brought an end to Krüger's activity in Copenhagen. He then took over the representation of the free cities in the Bundestag of the German Confederation at Frankfurt. On 14 June 1866 he addressed its last session, before the outbreak the Austro-Prussian War which ended that institution.
At that time Schleswig and Holstein were a Prusso-Austrian condominium, with Prussia occupying the former and Austria the latter. On 8 June 1866 Prussian general Von Manteuffel crossed the river Eider into Holstein, having warned the Austrians that he was exercising Prussia’s condominate right to establish garrisons in some unoccupied points of Holstein. Austria withdrew from Holstein, but invited the Bundestag to mobilise militarily against Prussia.
All three Hanseatic cities, through their envoy Krüger, voted against the Austrian proposal in the Bundestag on 14 June and jointly put a declaration formulated by Lübeck reasoning that the events in Holstein did not give rise to the mobilisation of the Confederation because the danger of an immediate collision was eliminated.
However the proposal was carried. The Lübeck Senate sided with the Prussian view that the Confederation should no longer exist, because of the illegal action of mobilisation and proposed that their Bundestag envoy Krüger be recalled. Carl Merck, foreign minister of Hamburg, wanted to wait and went to see the Lübeck Senate on 19 June to persuade them of this course.
On 21 June, the representatives of the Hanseatic cities met in Hamburg to discuss in detail measures which had been demanded by Prussia. The Prussian ambassador to the Hanseatic states, Emil von Richthofen, who also took part in this conference, emphasised that the abolition of all relations with Prussia's opponents was indispensable as a sign of friendly neutrality, and that therefore their Bundestag envoy in Frankfurt, Krüger, must be recalled. The meeting agreed to recall Krüger on 29 June.
Richthofen now tried to persuade the Senate of Hamburg to give in to other demands, namely to send a military contingent to assist Prussia and to agree to a new close federation under Prussian hegemony. On 24 June, he visited two prominent members of the House of Burgesses (Burgerschaft), (former President of the Burgerschaft and member of the Right party) and (leader of the Left party), to inform them of the intended rejection of the Prussian proposals by the Senate. He pointed out that Prussia would not accept a refusal without further action. He mentioned that Prussia would dissolve the Senate and take over the government. The Burgerschaft would remain undisturbed, as would the population, if they kept quiet. Otherwise, 10,000 Prussian troops would occupy the city. Merck, to whom Wolffson and Halben had already reported this, sent Krüger, who had been in Hamburg since 22 June, to Richthofen to obtain certainty about the Prussian threats.
At the 26 June meeting of the Hamburg Senate, Merck said that to avoid occupation of Hamburg, dissolution of the government or further coercion, it was now necessary to give way. All of northern Germany had joined Prussia, and one could not be sure what energetic steps Prussia could take. Krüger, still their Bundestag envoy, was not without influence on the decisions during the critical hours, and then had to return to Frankfurt to make a joint statement of the three cities. His attitude had been cautious since 16 June. Thus a milder answer to Prussia than originally proposed on 22 June was then sent.
Hanseatic Minister-Resident in Berlin.
In October 1866 he was appointed Minister-Resident of the Hanseatic cities in Berlin, in succession to Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken. When the new North German Federation came into being as a result of the Austro-Prussian war, among Kruger's most important tasks was the incorporation of the free cities he represented in the new federal and imperial structures. He advised on the take-over of the military establishments, the transition of the post and telegraph system to imperial control, and especially in the organisation of new customs relations. His own city Lübeck merged into the Customs Union shortly after joining the North German Federation, along with Lübeck’s neighbours the two Mecklenburg states, while twenty years later he dealt with the Customs Union accession of Bremen and Hamburg.
Shortly after his move to Berlin, he was able to inform Hamburg that the Prussian Ministry of Commerce could assist in promoting the construction of the Venlo-Hamburg railway, which Hamburg had agreed with Hanover before its annexation to Prussia. For Bremen, Krüger negotiated the territorial exchanges necessary to enable the expansion of Bremen's harbour districts.
Federal Council (Bundesrat).
In addition to his role as Hanseatic envoy in Berlin, he was appointed Lübeck’s plenipotentiary to the new Federal Council in 1868, alongside Gustav Kirchenpauer who represented Hamburg. In the Federal Council, Kruger contributed to the Judicial Committee, maritime affairs, trade and transport, railway, post and telegraphs, Alsace-Lorraine and the construction of the Reichstag building.
German Customs Union.
He concluded the commercial treaty with the city of Hamburg by which that city entered the German Customs Union. On 25 May 1881 this agreement was signed between the Prussian Finance Minister Karl Bitter and the State Secretary of the imperial Treasury, on the one hand, Hamburg's Plenipotentiary Senators Johannes Versmann and William Henry O'Swald, and Krüger, on the other. It stated that Hamburg was ready to accede to the Customs Union with all its territory, but excluding a permanent free port district which it specified. For this district, Article 34 of the imperial constitution would still apply, thus the freedoms of that district could not be abolished or restricted without Hamburg's approval.
In 1884 Bremen likewise applied to accede to the German Customs Union and he concluded negotiations in 1885. Bremen also secured a free port area, to be built below the old town. Also bonded warehouses for petroleum were to be set-up in the out-ports of Bremerhaven and Geestemunde.
Krüger died in post in Berlin on 17 January 1896, of a stomach bleeding. He was succeeded in April as Hanseatic Minister in Berlin by , also from Lübeck, who was appointed by the Senates of the three city states.

Rosa Bouton

Rosa Bouton (c. December 19, 1860 – February 15, 1951) was an American chemist and professor who organized and directed the School of Domestic Science (now the Department of Nutrition and Health Sciences) at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in 1898. Despite the lack of funding, Rosa Bouton worked to provide a course to teach young women about the realms of domestic science. As years passed and the demand for more courses and areas of study emerged, Bouton, as the sole instructor, continued to strengthen and build the department to provide such an education to these women.
Early life.
Rosa Bouton was born on December 19, 1860, in Albany, Kansas, near present-day Sabetha. Rosa was one of five children. Her mother was Fanny (Waldo) Bouton and her father was Eli F. Bouton. Prior to her birth, Rosa's parents had just settled in the northeast town of Kansas after traveling cross country from New York State. At the age of seven, Rosa faced the death of her mother. Her father, Eli Bouton, was an accredited school teacher and worked in education for many years. After the death of his wife in 1867, Eli soon remarried.
Education.
Rosa began her studies at the State Normal School in Peru, Nebraska. After just two years, in 1881, Rosa received her teaching certificate. Her work was recognized by a professor at the State Normal School, Henry Hudson Nicholson. Following his work at the State School, Nicholson moved on to teach chemistry at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln. As a consequence of Rosa's fine work, Nicholson invited Rosa to go to Nebraska with him. In 1888 Rosa enrolled in graduate school at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln and studied chemistry. Throughout her schooling years, Rosa also served as an instructor in the chemistry department. In 1891, she graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree and, just two years later, she also received a Master of Liberal Arts Degree.
Career.
1893–1912: Early career.
Following her graduation, Rosa Bouton remained very active within the scientific community. She continued to work for the chemistry department at the University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL), joined the American Chemical Society in 1893 and performed research that she would later publish in 1898. Rosa was the second female member of the American Chemical Society. While a graduate student at UNL, Rosa also was employed by the chemistry department, for whom she taught classes. For several years, Rosa taught courses relating both to analytical chemistry and applied domestic chemistry. The domestic science courses covered subjects such as food analysis, sanitation, and contaminants in food. Additionally, Rosa conducted research with a fellow faculty member, Samuel Avery, at UNL and in 1898 was published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society on her work with phenylglutaric acids. Her focus of study was on acids alongside the effect that phenyl groups have on the properties of acids.
In 1898, the University of Nebraska established a new School of Domestic Science. Along with this came the school's request for Rosa to organize it. Rosa had spent a lot of her time expanding upon her education and in 1894, she met with Ellen Swallow. Swallow was an active leader in organizing college-level courses related to home economic, of whom Rosa learned a lot from. It was in the school's best interest to have Rosa instruct these courses due to her dedication and expertise in this area of study. Rosa accepted this offer and began her work in developing this program. She was given an initial fifteen dollars from the school to acquire appliances including tables, sinks, stoves, cupboards, and other supplies vital to teaching domestic science. While this was not enough to equip the classroom with the proper materials, Rosa also received funding from the chemistry department with the help of her colleague, Henry Nicholson. Beyond this, Rosa often spent her own money on supplies and training. The summer of 1898, after accepting her role in this department, Rosa paid for herself to travel to Boston. There, she learned more about this the field of domestic science in order to improve the effect she would have on the department and women that she would be instructing the next fall. When the school officially opened, there were eleven students enrolled. Within two years, the enrollment had increased to forty-one and at this point, Rosa was named the director of this school. In 1906, just eight years after it first opened, the School of Domestic Science grew from a two-year program to a four-year program and was later renamed the College of Home Economics. With this came training for new instructors as well. The school continued to expand as the years passed; Rosa designed a new school that would be built in 1908. She spent a lot of time researching the quality and design of already established scientific facilities when planning for this construction. Another milestone came in 1912 when the enrollment for the School of Domestic Science reached over three hundred students. By this point, the school had also hired more trained instructors who would take over for Rosa Bouton in 1912 when she was asked to step down from her position. Rosa played a very large role in the local and national Home Economics Association and had written articles that were published in both "The Nebraska Teacher" and "The Nebraska Farmer". Her reputation was well established in Nebraska, however, at the age of fifty-one, she resigned from UNL and moved out of Nebraska.
1916–1951: Later career.
From 1912 to 1916, Rosa lived in San Diego, California where she ran a small speciality bakery. After the bakery's failure, she reentered the education industry and began teaching home economics courses at a high school in a small town in Arizona, called Winkelman, for about a year. Rosa was a woman of many trades as she accepted a position to become a home demonstration agent for the Arizona Agricultural Extension Services where she served in communities, helping women and working as a nurse and counselor. At the age of seventy-four, Rosa retired and moved back to California to live with her sister, Mary Bouton. As the years passed, she continued to watch as the UNL Department of Domestic Science continued to expand and grow. Years later, after fighting a long illness, Rosa Bouton died in Pomona, California, on February 15, 1951.
Legacy.
Rosa's legacy continues as she is considered a founding member of the Nebraska local section. Additionally, a women's dormitory at UNL was named in honor of her dedication to the school and contribution to its success.

Siege of Kolomna

Following the Battle of Voronezh River in December 1237, Yuri II of Vladimir sent both of his sons with "all his men" and Voivode Yeremey to defend the fortress of Kolomna, which was on the border to the Wild Fields.
Battle.
In Kolomna, the Vladimir-Suzdal army met some of the Ryazan survivors from the Battle of Voronezh River led by Prince Roman Ingvarevich. After some heavy fighting under the walls of Kolomna, the young princes Vsevolod and Vladimir retreated to Vladimir and Moscow, respectively. The small Russian force left in Kolomna was besieged and annihilated a few days after the destruction of Ryazan. This left the capital, Vladimir, open for the next Tatar onslaught.
Opposing forces.
According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, the contemporary historian of the Ilkhanate, Kolomna was the fiercest battle of the entire campaign: Kulkan, son of Genghis Khan, died in battle. Reasons for Mongol casualties, which were heavier than usual, might be:
Aftermath.
According to The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan, a few days after the fall of Kolomna, the main Mongol army was suddenly attacked "in the land of Suzdal". On January 11, 1238, the last remnant of Ryazan defenders, 1700 men under Evpaty Kolovrat, made a last stand for their country. Though probably fictional, the tale of their sacrifice is "one of the greatest epics in the history of Russia".

Brick By Brick (band)

Brick By Brick is a hardcore metal band based out of Albany, New York. They have released five studio records and three 7" vinyl. The record "Thin The Heard" was re-released on 12" vinyl in 2017.
History.
Brick By Brick was based on the Troy-Core style that the founding members grew up on. Mike Valente recruited Sean Green and Rory O'Brien after having a conversation about similar musical interests. Rich Roberts was picked as their frontman after a few other auditions. The idea was to be reminiscent of Hatebreed, Slayer, and the Troy style. At the time, they all lived in Troy, New York, and the "Troy-Core" moniker was embraced.
In less than a year, the band released their first record "Pull The Trigger". In 2007, they released their second record, "Wings Of Angels". Both records are out of print.
They released their third album, "Severed Ties", independently in 2010.
In 2012, O'Brien decided to leave the band to focus more on his family. The band recruited James Muller to fill in, but eventually became a permanent member. The band released a 7" split with the California-based hardcore band, Ruckus. Brick By Brick contributed a song to the split called "In The Ruins", which featured guest vocalist Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain. In 2014, Brick By Brick started touring. Not long after the band rose to the next level, Roberts was replaced by Ray Mazzola of Full Blown Chaos. The band has appeared at festivals including New England Metal Fest, Black n Blue Bowl, Tsunami Fest, Breast Fest, Motorcity Fest, Grownfest, and the Rebellion Tour, among others.
In 2015, the band signed with Eulogy Recordings and released their first international record, "This World, My Enemy". Their next international record, "Thin The Heard", was released on Fast Break! Records in 2017.
In late 2017, Sean Green had a mutual departure from the band. He was replaced by Andy Parsons.
In 2018, Brick By Brick signed with Upstate Records, and entered the studio to record their sixth studio record, "Hive Mentality", which would include a revamp of the song "In The Ruins", again featuring Vincent Bennett of The Acacia Strain. The record also featured guest vocals from Tony Foresta of the bands Municipal Waste and Iron Reagan, as well as vocals from Jessica Pimentel, lead vocalist for the band Alekhine's Gun.

Ruiner (video game)

Ruiner is a cyberpunk shoot 'em up video game developed by Reikon Games and published by Devolver Digital. It was released in 2017 on several platforms.
Gameplay.
"Ruiner" is a shoot 'em up played from an isometric perspective. The game takes place in 2091 and is set in a cyberpunk metropolis known as Rengkok. The player takes control of a silent, masked protagonist who attempts to rescue their kidnapped brother from a failing conglomerate, known as Heaven, that controls Rengkok.
Synopsis.
"Ruiner" takes place in 2091 in Rengkok and its surrounding facilities, owned by Heaven, a conglomerate led by a man referred to in-game as the Boss. Initially the player character, a silent protagonist dubbed "Puppy" by another character, is being led by a rogue hacker named Wizard to assassinate the Boss. Before he reaches the Boss's office, the signal from Wizard to the protagonist is overridden by another hacker known only as Her. Her explains to Puppy that Wizard was contracted by another group and that his brother has been kidnapped, and urges him to track Wizard down. She leads him to a territory filled with Creeps, a group of psychotic gangsters led by a swordsman named Nerve. After fighting his way through the Creeps' territory, Nerve challenges Puppy to a duel and is defeated in battle. Earning the Creeps' leadership, they find Wizard and hack into his brain, killing him in the process and leading them to the Hanza Compound, a factory that manufactures machine parts. Her tracks Puppy's brother down with a signal leading to him.
They are greeted by armed guards and the angry AI that manages the compound, Mother. Puppy fights his way through the Hanza facility and fights against mercenaries hired by TrafficKing, a cyborg in the form of a UFO-like device piloted by a human head, who runs the facility alongside Mother and presumably contracted Wizard. As he follows the signal that leads to his brother, Puppy battles Mother and then TrafficKing, hacking his brain to reveal where his brother is being taken; the Imagination Farms, which use human beings as hosts to lend brainpower for running Virtuality, a virtual reality device that Heaven manufactures and sells to civilians. As TrafficKing has clearance for entering these areas, Puppy and Her kidnap him to gain access to the farms.
Puppy, led by Her and accompanied by the tamed TrafficKing, scour the Imagination Farms for his brother's signal, and are confronted by Geminus, a dual-personality cyborg that presents itself as two twin sisters that act as host to Mother. TrafficKing has been working for Geminus and it has been established that they were using Wizard to form a coup to overthrow the Boss and control Heaven. TrafficKing dies after begrudgingly helping Puppy through overheated obstacles, burning to death. Puppy confronts Geminus but is attacked by the resurrected TrafficKing, now controlling a humanoid cyborg body. Puppy kills him and battles Geminus, killing both sisters and finally finding the mechanical pod that holds his brother.
Upon approaching it, a cutscene showing two small children leaving the facility plays, and the game cuts back to Heaven, where Puppy is restrained in a jumpsuit as two guards and the Boss, who wears a mask identical to Puppy's, approach him. The Boss reveals that Puppy was only being used for spare parts due to their biological similarity, and that he was hacked by Wizard as he could potentially be anywhere the Boss could be. Her is an independent hacker contracted by the Boss to hack Puppy and make him believe he had a brother who was kidnapped, thus leading him back to the Boss while also exterminating the people who attempted to overthrow him. The Boss remarks that he will keep Puppy closer to him, when Her makes a reappearance and reveals that she is not human and has been tricking the Boss since their agreement; she has led Puppy to Heaven to kill the Boss. Her advises Puppy to 'meet her where heaven falls' if he survives. He escapes his restraints and kills many of the Boss's guards before finally approaching the Boss himself, and, depending on a dialogue prompt, will either bludgeon him with his weapon or hack his brain. The ending shows Puppy riding away on his motorcycle to an unknown destination.
Development and release.
"Ruiner" was developed by Polish indie game studio Reikon Games and published by Devolver Digital. The game was released for Linux, PlayStation 4, Microsoft Windows, Xbox One on 26 September 2017. A Nintendo Switch version was released on June 18, 2020.
Reception.
Critical reception towards "Ruiner" was generally positive. Omri Pettite of PC Gamer stated that ""Ruiner" is gorgeous, a sensory feast inspired by the works of cyberpunk's 1980s heyday, in which a silent, masked protagonist travels through the nightscapes and industrial jungles of a grit-tech 2091. Underneath, a thumping top-down action game delivers sword-sharp combat, the familiarity of its design offset by the constant urge to simply stand still and drink everything in." In his review for both the game and "Cuphead", Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw of "Zero Punctuation" said he didn't like "Ruiner" because it felt like "a cyberpunk ripoff of "Hotline Miami" with none of what made "Hotline Miami" interesting [...] Yeah, the fights were hard, but I wasn't getting that all-important sense of payoff; all I felt I was "earning" was more chances to fight boring gang members in murky environments."

Church of St John the Baptist, Barnstaple

The Church of St John the Baptist on South Street in Barnstaple in Devon is the Anglican parish church for the Newport area of the town. The church comes under the Diocese of Exeter.
In 1829 a church was built on the site of a former medieval chapel as a chapel of ease for the community of Newport within the parish of Bishop's Tawton. The parish became independent in 1847, at which time the church building was in urgent need of repair. The current building was completed in 1882. The nave, chancel, north aisle, vestries and the north porch are built of local limestone. In the 1960s a church hall was built adjacent to the church and linked to it by a covered walkway. 
On the north wall of the church is a memorial to the men of the parish who lost their lives during World War II. The choir vestry, a new bell and windows on the north side of the church were added in 1929 in commemoration of the church's centenary, with celebrations being led by Lord William Cecil, Bishop of Exeter.

Samuel Shapleigh

Samuel Shapleigh (July 9, 1765 – April 17, 1800) was an American librarian.
Shapleigh was born in Kittery, Maine, on July 9, 1765. Left an orphan at an early age, he was twenty before he entered Harvard College with the class of 1789. He taught a while in the Cambridge grammar school, and then studied law, but his poor health prevented him from practicing. In November, 1790, he was chosen Butler and three years later (27 August 1793) Librarian. His salary was fixed at $360, on condition that he or a substitute should "continue in the College during the Summer, Fall and Spring vacations that Company may have access to the Library." He acted as Librarian until his death, on April 17, 1800.
He was buried in Cambridge, where his gravestone identified him as "a virtuous son, faithful librarian, and liberal benefactor of Harvard College". By his will he bequeathed nearly the whole of his property to Harvard, the income to "be sacredly appropriated to the purchase of such modern publications as the Corporation, Professors, and Tutors shall judge most proper to improve the students in polite literature ; the books to be deposited in the library of the University, and to consist of poetry and prose, but neither in Greek nor Latin."
