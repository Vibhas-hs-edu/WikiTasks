E. A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant

E.A Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant is a water treatment plant located next to the California State University, Sacramento campus. This water treatment plant, along with Sacramento River Water Treatment Plant on Sacramento River, provide approximately eighty five percent of Sacramento's drinking water. This treatment plant was recently renovated and completed in February 2019.
Location.
The EA Faibairn Water Treatment Plant is located near to Sacramento State University and is adjacent to the American River where the plant gets most of its water to begin the treatment process. With the facility being expanded; the older water intensive terrain was removed and replaced with plants that are characterized for being water conserving. Surrounding the plant are large Sycamores that lead to a dry creek infiltration area that captures runoff from storm events, that is added to the supply of water for treatment.
History.
The City of Sacramento has two water intake structures, Sacramento River Water Treatment on Sacramento River and E.A Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant the American River. As previously mentioned, both of these water intakes provide more than half of Sacramento drinking water making the two water structures valuable to Sacramento. The E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment plant was originally built in 1964. The water treatment plant was planned to being expanded further in 2005. The water structure was expanded because several issues had arisen with the original structure.
Operation.
The water treatment plant has a maximum diversion capacity of 310 cubic feet per second or 200 million gallons/day, but is constrained by the current technology that will only allow it to pull around 155 cubic feet per second. The E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant has become part of an agreement back in 2015 to meet city demands of growing population by the year 2030. However, there are discrepancies based on the Hodge Flow Criteria that determine how much the treatment plant can take. The Hodge Flow Criteria describes the minimum in-stream flows needed for consideration to allow diversion for water uptake depending if the flow is greater than or less than the measured index. When Flow is above the Hodge Flow Criteria, water can be sold to residencies and private water consumers at whole sale prices. When stream flow is below Hodge Flow Criteria, water can be provided on wholesale when the rate of pumpback is equal to or exceed delivery rates. Once again, this is based on the 2015 plan for urban water development that can change at any time in the near future.
The EA Fairbairn Water Treatment plant is designed to treat up to 200 million gallons per day utilizing settling, coagulation with aluminum sulfate, chlorine disinfection (2 times), fluoridation, and pH adjustment. Sludge Dewatering occurs at the site where alum (aluminum sulfate) sludge from sedimentation basin, and spent lime from CT basin and reservoirs is then pumped to sludge drying lagoons. Filter wash water lagoons allow for settling and evaporation. The supernatant of this process is historically discharged to the headworks or sanitary sewer. The EA Fairbairn WTP has three sludge drying lagoons and two filer wash lagoons that are all concrete lines, sludge is removed from these lagoons when they are no longer free draining, and further dried to a solids content of 20-50% before disposal. The dried sludge is then disposed at an offside solid waste landfill.
EA Fairbairn WTP submitted to the Region 5 Water Quality Control Board a conceptual sludge management plan to help save money. The plan consisted of efforts to prevent or minimize sludge exposure to stormwater runoff and a plan to provide sludge only to public agencies and business with an appropriate licenses and permits.
Structural issues and further improvement.
Many of the early 1960s concrete hydraulic structures have developed several, concerning water leaks. The Sacramento Utilities of Sacramento did a condition assessment study that was completed in 2009 which identified that the infrastructure at the treatment plant needed either placement or rehabilitation. These leaks caused concerns for the existing concrete structures and equipment. The structures and out-dated equipment are concerning but there is also concern regarding personnel safety. Many construction companies are coming in and will be involved in several parts of the construction, this construction group is one of many companies that are being brought in by the City of Sacramento to work on the treatment plant.
Construction.
Overaa Construction is a mid-sized company of regional engineers, builders, and craftsmen that work on multiple projects that range from infrastructure development and upgrading antiquated projects to modern standards. Overaa Construction is a primary contractor to the rehabilitation projects of both the Sacramento River Water Treatment Plant (SRWTP), and the E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant (EAFWTP). The E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant would involve the complete re-transformation of the current water infrastructure system that was built back in the 1920s. Since the EAFWTP is limited to the amount of water it can draw from the American River year round; the upgrades will be crucial to the future of the treatment plant, and the efficiency of its operations. This will increase the filtering capacity and reliability of the current pumps within the plant. As said by Jeff Naff, the vice president of water treatment projects "These improvements will provide the city with the most footprint-effective solution for processing water".
Blocka Construction.
Blocka Construction Incorporated provided construction with the electrical and instrumentation system that were necessary for the plant to increase its original 1964 capacity of 80 MGD to 160 MGD. BCI’s construction improvements included lighting systems, fiber optics, fire alarms, gate controllers, data systems, telephone systems, and a North and South Power Center.
Part of the construction process included new SMUD electrical services and an emergency generator backup power. The rehabilitation work on EA Fairbairn was expected to create 455 total jobs (262 direct, 193 indirect and induced), and create 70.2 million dollars in total economic output. Some of the environmental considerations for the project included the adoption of a Water Treatment Plants Rehabilitation Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation Reporting Program (Resolution No. 2012-067) on March 20, 2012 by the City Council. An addendum to the adopted Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared in accordance with CEQA Guidelines Section 15164, adopted on April 9, 2013 (Resolution No. 2013-0112).
Challenges.
Overaa Construction is working with a team of qualified local and national engineers, consultants and contractors to make sure they are dealing with challenges that arise while working on the facilities. While the improvements are underway, the treatment plant will remain fully operational. Water will still be delivered to citizens around the Sacramento region. Challenges during the improvements include the installation of a new filter complex. This is where the water is filtered out to meet potable standards before further treatment. Another challenge is timing, the structure is estimated to require about 60,000 work hours to complete. The E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment facility can be closed for two months out of the year during periods of lower demand. This will shift treatment capacity to the other treatment plant within Sacramento to provide potable water. During this time treatment capacity and shits will also be allocated differently to accommodate the retrofitting process.
Improvements.
Improvements to the E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant are few but deemed necessary for continual operations towards future water treatment applications. Installation of five centrifuges that are manufactured by German manufacturers Andritz would be used to turn muddy water into sludge. A new waste wash-water facility will be built on the premises; these would be built on the already existing water collection basins. Additionally, a sludge-collection system and yard piping would be installed. Two more thickeners, and an additional pumping station were planned to be built on the western area of the plant which is still undeveloped. The new addition of the new pumping station will allow for treatment of 100 million more gallons per day, and still be operable within terms to the maximum of 310 cubic feet per second. The new thickeners will extend about 9 ft below the surface, and the new pumping station will be about 11 ft below the surface. Lastly a new dewatering and disposal system is planned to be built on the eastern side of the sludge pond toward the southern area of the plant.
Ecology.
The Sacramento River and the E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment plant are both situated on a level floodplain south of the American River. The Sacramento Valley was described by the prevalence of wetlands, and freshwater marshes that covered an approximate range of 500,000 acres of land. Dominant terrestrial animal species included black-tailed deer, tule elk, and pronghorn. Marsh, and grasslands within riparian complexes were habitats to waterfowl such as ducks, herons, and cranes. The E.A. Fairbairn Water Treatment Plant lies near a significant bend on the American River. Flooding had becoming increasingly common near the nineteenth-century due to increased mining operations that lead to rapid channel soil deposition. Deposition was largely attributed to hydrologic mining processes that would include fragments from parent rock material from the up stream of the American River. Soils of the Americanos-Urban land complex are mapped at the surface; in the southwest part of the Fairbairn WTP area, and the Rossmoor-Urban land complex are mapped to the north and east. Both soils are associated with alluvial deposits seen in the area. The two soils are quite different in their soil development, the Americanos soils are well-developed, while the Rossmoor soils have no subsurface horizons evident. Studies based on radiocarbon evidence have shown that the Americanos soils in the southwest area are estimated to be between 25,000 and 11,500 years old.

Third Battle of Katwa

The Third Battle of Katwa occurred between the Nawab of Bengal, Mir Qasim and the British East India Company in 1763. Dissatisfied with Nawab Mir Qasim's administration, the English deposed him in favor of his father-in-law Mir Jafar and officially declared war against Mir Qasim on July 7, 1763. The English command was given to Major Thomas Adams, who led a small force, variously estimated as between 3,000 and 5,000 men, of whom, approximately 1,000 were European. The Nawab had a total of approximately 25,000 troops at his disposal, led by the Armenian general Gurgin Khan. Although the Nawab's forces were numerically larger, they were hastily cobbled together and riven by internal strife. The Nawabi force that confronted the English at Katwa was a much smaller contingent under the leadership of the accomplished general Muhammad Taqi Khan, the Faujdar of Birbhum.
On July 17, 1763, the English forces marching from various cantonments in Medinipur and Bardhaman districts, established post at Agradwip, a village 14 km downstream from Katwa. There they were met by the newly re-instated Nawab Mir Jafar. Meanwhile, Mir Qasim's forces had established themselves at Palashi, 20 km upstream from Katwa. On that morning, a band of irregular Nawabi forces, mostly cavalry, engaged Lieutenant Glenn of the English forces, who was escorting a convoy of cattle, grain, and treasure to Agradwip. The battle lasted four hours with the treasure changing hands three times. Ultimately, after heavy casualties on both sides, the Nawabi forces withdrew and Lieutenant Glenn pressed his advantage by marching upon the fort at Katwa. The Nawabi garrison at Katwa surrendered after putting up a feeble resistance.
Meanwhile, Muhammad Taqi Khan had advanced the main body of his forces to Katwa; and on the morning of July 19, 1763, Major Adams advanced to attack him. The battle which followed has been described as "one of the bloodiest and best-contested of the whole war." Ultimately, the British were able to ambush and kill Muhammad Taqi Khan, dealing a double blow to Mir Qasim's cause by winning the immediate battle and depriving Mir Qasim of the expertise and military acumen of one of his best generals in future battles.

Johannes Philipp von Lamberg

Johann Philipp von Lamberg (Vienna, 25 May 1652 – Regensburg, 21 October 1712) was an Austrian Catholic cardinal and bishop.
Biography.
Johann Philipp von Lamberg was born in Vienna on 25 May 1652 and was baptized the following day. He was the uncle of Cardinal Joseph Dominik von Lamberg (1680-1761).
Having completed his studies in Vienna and Passau, he went to study in Siena where he obtained his doctorate in utroque iure (canon law and civil law) on 14 August 1673.
He personally took part in the war against the Turks and was an Austrian ambassador in several countries, including in Poland. Received the ecclesiastical tonsure and minor orders on 29 January 1668, he obtained the subdeacon on 13 September 1684 and finally the diaconate. He became a canon of the cathedrals of Passau, Salzburg and Olomouc. He was appointed Imperial Councilor.
Elected bishop of Passau from his own chapter on 25 May 1689, he was granted access to the office despite not yet having received the diaconate with a papal dispensation of 11 January 1690. At the same time, for his consecration as bishop, he was guaranteed the dispensation to be appointed to the episcopal see by a bishop and two abbots working together since on 14 January 1690 there were no bishops in the area who were not involved in other religious or territorial issues. Appointed royal commissioner in Regensburg, he was imperial plenipotentiary minister to the Diet of Regensburg.
Created cardinal priest in the consistory of 21 June 1700, he participated in the conclave that at the end of that same year elected Pope Clement XI. On 3 January 1701 he received the cardinal's purple and the title of San Silvestro in Capite. So he received from the Holy See the task of visiting the various Italian princes in the search for armies against France in the War of Spanish Succession. He became an adviser to the emperors Leopold I, Joseph I and Charles VI.
In his court of Passau he had as Kapellmeister Georg Muffat and Benedikt Anton Aufschnaiter.
He died on 21 October 1712 in the abbey of St Emmeram in Regensburg. His corpse, transported to Passau, was publicly displayed in the city cathedral and then buried in the chapel that he had himself erected in the cathedral cloister.

General Directorate of Border Guard

The General Directorate of Border Guard (Arabic: المديرية العامة لحرس الحدود السعودية) is a Saudi agency responsible for guarding land and sea borders of the Kingdom. Awwad Eid Al-Aradi Al-Balawi is the Directorate general of Saudi Arabian Border Guards.
History.
The late King Abdulaziz Al Saud laid the foundation of the organs of the state. In 10/7/1331.H (14 June 1913) The late king was preoccupied and first concerned about the formation and setting up land and maritime patrols and surveillance centres in the Eastern region. The patrols and the centres were consisting of small sailing boats that sail along the coast supported by land patrols on camel’s back to watch the land.
In 1344 H, (c.1925) the core of the Coast Guard Authority was established in Jeddah and it was tasked with organizing the duties, roles and responsibilities of patrols, seaports and harbors. In 1347 H, (c.1928) the work of the patrols, seaports and harbors in Jeddah was unified under one leadership, which was "Coast Guard"; and its work was limited to the Red Sea coast. Coast Guard was entitled to carry out its duties on foot or on camels back, these patrols were tasked with inspecting wild land and seizing contraband items. The sea patrols were tasked with monitoring the coast within the territorial waters of the Kingdom by means of primitive boats. In 1353 H, (c.1934) the codes and regulations governing "The Coast Guard Authority” were issued, including all the provisions related to the roles, responsibilities and duties carried out by Coast Guard; under theses governing codes and regulations, the Coast Guard Authority was placed under the leadership of the Ministry of Interior.
In 1355 H, (c.1936) the Coast Guard Authority was established in the Eastern region. In 1382 H, (c.1963) the Frontier Forces was established and both Eastern and Jeddah Coast Guard authorities has been integrated under the name of “the General Directorate of Frontier Forces, Ports and Coast Guard”. In 1394 H, (c.1974) a royal decree No. M / 26, dated 24/6/1394 H (15 July 1974) was issued approving the governing regulations of border security Code as per Cabinet's Resolution No. 923, dated 19/6/1394 H the name was changed to be the "General Directorate of Frontier Forces". In 1399 H, His Royal Highness the Minister of Interior passed a decision No. 2S/ 7074, dated 26/9/1399 H, (19 Aug 1979) by reassigning the duties and responsibilities carried out by Border Guard; to watch, control and protect all seaports in the Kingdom instead of the General Directorate of Public Security. In 1412 H (c.1992), His Royal Highness the Minister of Interior passed a decision No. 85/5/SH, dated 1/8/1412 H, (5 Feb 1992) amending the executive regulations governing Border Security code In 1414 H, (c.1993) a royal decree No. M/9, dated 16/7/1414 H, (29 Dec 1993) was issued approving Cabinet's Resolution No. 76, dated 14/7/1414 H (27 Dec 1993) amending the name of the "General Directorate Frontier Forces" to be "General Directorate of Border Guard".

Florence LeSueur

Florence Ruth LeSueur (March 17, 1898 – June 27, 1991) was an African-American civic leader, activist and the first woman president of an NAACP chapter. She was a champion of black rights in employment and education.
Early life.
She was born as Florence Ruth Barrett on March 17, 1898 to Frank C. and Maude (née Lawson) Barrett in Pennsylvania. She attended Wilberforce University and later moved to Boston in 1935. LeSueur had been a long-time resident of the South End, a neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts.
Career.
Florence LeSueur was the first to head a Boston-wide education committee under the NAACP. From 1948 until 1951 she served as the president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, and was the first woman president of a branch in the nation. She was recognized for her role of being the first female president of an NAACP Branch when the 41st Annual NAACP Convention took place in 1950. She was joined in attendance at the conference by fellow Massachusetts residents, Boston mayor, John B. Hynes, and Lieutenant Governor Charles E. Jeff Sullivan. Topics being discussed at the conference included "The Church and the NAACP" and "Registration and Voting."
LeSueur also worked on the founding of METCO (Metropolitan Council for Education Opportunity) alongside Ruth Batson. The goal was to bus intercity students in Boston to suburban schools in an attempt to desegregate Boston's schools. LeSueur's granddaughter, was one of the first participants in this program, arriving at East Junior High School in Braintree, Massachusetts. She recalls press and photographers outside the school as she left the bus. METCO also assisted parents with fighting for their children's quality of education, as many of the inner city kids were not placed in college prep classes at these newly integrated schools.
Florence LeSueur supported and signed a letter with fellow members of the NAACP against the Rankin bill, H.R. 314, in Congress. This letter was sent with support from the NAACP organization on May 24, 1951. This bill created a segregated veterans hospital in Franklin County, Mississippi. The letter that LeSueur signed argued that the location of the hospital would be inaccessible and unnecessary because the veterans were not subjected to segregation while they were fighting in the war and should not be afterwards.
During her time with the NAACP, six black men were hired as Boston Elevated Railway drivers (the predecessor of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority), due to her unrelenting determination. In order to persuade transit system officials that blacks deserved better job roles, LeSueur organized demonstrations near the Dudley Square station and she led delegations for the cause. These actions eventually resulted in getting blacks hired at a higher job level as drivers. For more than 20 years she was a director of the NAACP branch. Additionally, in 1959 she served as president of the Harriet Tubman House (now part of United South End Settlements).
In her later years in the 1970s, along with her daughter The Rev. Leota Ruth Santos, together they founded a church out of the basement of Florence's home in Brockton, Massachusetts. The Church was named "The United Church of The First Born." The church congregation later moved to a site in Hanson, Massachusetts.
Personal life.
She died on June 27, 1991 at age 93 in a nursing home in Brockton, Massachusetts. She was a mother to eleven children and a grandmother to fifty two grandchildren. LeSueur also befriended Eleanor Roosevelt while fighting for civil rights.

Washington State Capitol Conservatory

The Washington State Capitol Conservatory was a greenhouse on the grounds of the Washington State Capitol in Olympia, Washington. It was funded $25,000 in 1938, designed by architect Joseph Wohleb, and built in 1939 as a Works Project Administration project. In the 1990s it was noted the greenhouse was suffering foundation damage from soil settling of up to deep fill on which it was built. A 1995 report indicated that there was fear of a landslide causing catastrophe to the building, built next to a steep ravine where "a number of springs and wet areas were observed" (Olympia is noted for both its rainy climate and its artesian springs). Heritage Park's hillside trail climbs from Capitol Lake to a landing containing the Law Enforcement Memorial, adjacent to the conservatory. Due to safety concerns stemming from the settling, the conservatory was closed in 2008 and the building was demolished between 2020 and 2021. For a time it was used to store the Chief Shelton Story Pole (totem pole) after it was taken down in 2010. Until its closure it was open to the public and was an attraction for visitors to the State Capitol.
Capitol gardens.
The gardens and grounds at the Capitol campus were filled with plants grown in the conservatory. Over 70,000 flowers and plants each year were grown there in the 1950s.

Louisa Gregory

Louisa Catherine Allen Gregory (December 9, 1848 – May 1, 1920), was a pioneer in the field of domestic science. She was born in 1848 in Scott County, Kentucky, and graduated from Decatur High School. She continued her pursuit of education, attending Illinois State Normal University. In 1874 Louisa Allen became a faculty member at Illinois Industrial University, as a pioneer member of the School of Domestic Science and Art. In June 1880, she resigned as a professor at the University of Illinois after marrying Regent John Milton Gregory on June 18, 1879. He died in 1898.
Early life and education.
Louisa Catherine Allen was born in Scott County, Kentucky to David Skillman Allen and Amanda Risk Allen on December 9, 1848. Louisa Allen spent her childhood in the industrial revolution, where inventions such as the sewing machine made their debut. She attended the local school in Mason County and committed herself to becoming a teacher in Illinois. She attended Illinois State Normal University in Bloomington, Illinois and obtained her degree in three years, graduating in 1870.
Shortly after leaving Normal University, Louisa Allen accepted a position as principal of the high school in Alton, Illinois. One year later she moved to Peoria and taught at the County Normal School until she was hired at Illinois Industrial University.
Career.
Louisa Allen became a professor at Illinois Industrial University, now known as the University of Illinois, in 1874 as a member of the School of Domestic Science and Art. While teaching, Louisa Allen educated young women, proclaiming that " the house-keeper needs education as much as the house-builder," such that women can be "equals of their educated husbands and associates, and enabling them to bring the aids of science and culture to all the important labors and vocations of womanhood." The curriculum for a degree in Domestic Science and Arts included everything from advanced botany, to medieval history, and Household Esthetics. While on staff at the university, Louisa Allen acted as the dean of women students, known as the Perceptress. She resigned in 1880.

Microtis angusii

Microtis angusii, commonly known as the Mona Vale onion orchid, and Angus's onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to New South Wales. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small, crowded green flowers. It is only known from a single population near Ingleside where it grows in soil that may have been imported from elsewhere.
Description.
"Microtis angusii" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and sixty green flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long, about wide and the lateral sepals are a similar length but narrower with their tips rolled under. The petals are about long and wide and are held under the dorsal sepal. The labellum is long, about wide with a lumpy edge and a shallow notch on the tip. Flowering occurs from May to October.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis angusii" was first formally described by David Jones in 1996 and the description was published in "The Orchadian". The specific epithet ("angusii") honours Reginald James Angus who discovered the species in 1987.
Distribution and habitat.
The Mona Vale onion orchid grows is only known from a single disturbed site at the type location near Ingleside. The site was previously used as a soil dump and as a parking area for work vehicles. It is possible that the orchid has germinated in the imported soil.
Conservation.
"Microtis angusii" is listed as "Endangered" under the New South Wales "Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016" and under the Commonwealth Government "Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999" (EPBC) Act. The species is threatened mainly by weed invasion as well as by illegal rubbish dumping, grazing by rabbits and other herbivores and habitat degradation due to unrestricted access.

1979 PBA Invitational Championship

The 1979 PBA Invitational Championship was the third conference of the 1979 PBA season. It started on November 20 and ended on December 15, 1979.
Toyota Tamaraws won the Invitational crown for the third straight year, defeating arch rival Crispa Walk Tall Jeans, three games to one.
Format.
The following format will be observed for the duration of the tournament:
Finals.
Fortunato Co shot 22 points and Abet Guidaben added 10 as half of the players fielded by Crispa coach Baby Dalupan hit in double figures. Philip Cezar also starred with 18 points for the Jeansmakers, nine in the second quarter as Walk Tall took the half by 11 points, 58-47.
Walk Tall Jeans faced an intact Toyota lineup by virtue of a management decision to reactivate three players suspended at the start of the third conference by coach Dante Silverio. Ramon Fernandez, Abe King and Estoy Estrada reported for their first game but the Tamaraws found themselves without a coach as Dante Silverio resigned earlier in the day as both manager and coach.
Crispa played with only one import as Irvin Chatman was in sick bay. Toyota led by 10 points, 36-26 at the end of the first quarter. The Tamaraws went full steam in the second quarter and posted a 22-point lead at the half. With Andy Fields and Bruce King running rings around the lone Walk Tall Jeans import Bernard Harris, the Tamaraws upped their lead to 27 at the close of the third quarter, 94-67. Early in the fourth, Crispa coach Baby Dalupan went All-Filipino to signify he was throwing in the towel. With still 6:30 to go, Toyota held its biggest lead in the game at 37 points, 107-70. 
The Tamaraws outscored the Jeansmakers, 31-20, in the second quarter for a 52-42 halftime lead from which Crispa never recovered. The defending champions went on to post their biggest lead, 82-63,and then held off a rally by the Jeansmakers in the closing minutes.
Robert Jaworski lobbed in seven straight points as Toyota tried to breakaway, 83-75, midway in the final quarter. The Tamaraws were up by four points when Andrew Fields capped a 9-4 binge with a towering dunkshot that took out the pressure, 94-85, with 1:54 to go.

The Ethel Waters Show

The Ethel Waters Show was a one-hour American television variety special that ran in the earliest days of NBC, on June 14, 1939, and was hosted by actress and singer Ethel Waters. Waters was the first black performer, male or female, to have her own TV show and may very well have been the first black person to appear on television.
The special was transmitted from the NBC Studios in New York over W2XBS.
The special included Waters performing a dramatic sequence from her most recent Broadway play "Mamba's Daughters", along with two actresses from the production, Georgette Harvey and Fredi Washington. The cast also included Joey Faye and Philip Loeb, performing skits.

World Skating Federation

The World Skating Federation (WSF) was an effort in 2003 to replace the International Skating Union as the governing body for ice skating.
History.
The WSF was founded in the aftermath of the 2002 Winter Olympics figure skating scandal. Plans for the organization were announced in March 2003, and involved former ISU officials Sally-Anne Stapleford, Sonia Bianchetti, Ron Pfenning, and Britta Lindgren.
The group promised to judge in an unbiased manner, utilizing the 6.0 system, and ensure that ice skating judging panels will be held accountable, and be geographically balanced.
Most of the group's members were noted to be from the United States, or work there. At the time plans for WSF were announced, the group had a planned budget of $1 million, but had only raised about $200,000. The money was mostly raised from individuals making small donations.
Reception.
At the time of the group's founding, it had received no support from any national skating federations, despite claims at the time the United States Figure Skating Association will support the WSF. The USFSA's executive committee would later vote to endorse the WSF's principles, but not the group itself.
In addition, International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge declined to meet with the group, or consider its platforms, saying the IOC only recognizes one federation per sport.
ISU officials condemned efforts at creating the WSF, and also criticized its members, saying they did nothing to produce judging reforms during their time at ISU.
Criticisms of WSF members, similar to those voiced by the ISU, were echoed by those outside of the ISU, but the group did receive positive comments from at least one commentator, who said its members were echoing sentiments that are well known for some time.
Response by ISU.
ISU officials have threatened to punish federations or individuals who support the breakaway group. Hungarian judge Judit Furst-Tombor was dropped from the judging panel at a competition, a day after she joined the press conference announcing the WSF's founding. Some national federations, like Skate Canada, also threatened to expel its members, should they support the WSF.
In response, WSF officials filed a lawsuit against ISU in December 2003, citing anti-competitive behavior. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed in February 2005. Shortly thereafter, Pfenning, at the time the group's Acting President, announced that the group will be dissolved.
Eventually, ISU decided that Furst-Tombor, along with Stapleford, Pfenning, Lindgren, Jon Jackson and Jan Garden, were excluded from the group.

Annie Landau

Annie Landau (20 March 1873 – 23 January 1945) headed the Evelina de Rothschild School in Jerusalem from 1899 until her death in 1945. She received the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire from King George VI in 1924 in recognition of her service.
Early life.
Landau was born to Chaya and Marcus Landau, strict Orthodox Jews who were active in the Jewish community. She attended the Bishopsgate Ward School for elementary school, a school established by reformers of women's education after the 1869 Endowed School Act and supported by the wife of Mayer Amschel de Rothschild. For high school, due to the lack of religious Jewish girls' schools in London, she attended Rabbi Samson Rafael Hirsch's Jewish High School for Girls in Frankfurt on the Main. This time was a formative period for her; Landau learned Jewish studies and secular studies simultaneously, as well as concepts of Jewish education. After getting a teacher's certificate at the Graystoke Teachers' Training College in 1894, she became a teacher in London at the Westminster Jews' Free School, a Jewish school that took government exams and maintained modern education methods and standards.
Administration of the Evelina de Rothschild School.
The Evelina de Rothschild School was established as the first Jewish school for girls in Palestine by Baron Lionel de Rothschild in 1867. It was taken over in 1892 by the Anglo-Jewish Association, who desired to influence the developing cultural character of the region, although the Baron continued to contribute towards its upkeep. In 1898, seeking trained teachers to improve the educational and hygienic standards of the school, the Anglo-Jewish Association hired 25-year-old Landau to be the school's assistant headmistress. When the headmistress resigned in 1899, Landau was appointed its new headmistress. Landau submitted annual formal reports to the Ladies' Committee of the Anglo-Jewish Association, which included information about the state of the school's finances as well as the progress of the students.
1898-1913.
The Evelina School grew under Landau's administration. In 1899, Landau's first year as headmistress, there were 292 students in the school and 225 children in kindergarten; by 1903, there were 333 students in the school and 273 in the kindergarten. Although the school was constantly faced with a shortage of space and funds, Landau added teachers to the school staff and incorporated new courses in practical domestic skills into the curriculum. She began a campaign to emphasize health, cleanliness and hygiene among the Evelina School students, especially due to the cholera, meningitis, and scarlet fever epidemics that occasionally spread throughout Jerusalem. During one epidemic the Evelina School was ordered to stay open, as medical authorities felt its premises were cleaner than the students' houses.
Landau worked tirelessly to find work for Evelina School graduates. She encouraged her graduates to be self-reliant; Landau knew that girls with jobs often married later, in their upper teens instead of at twelve or thirteen. The Evelina School offered courses and employment opportunities for its graduates, whether in education or domestic skills such as lace-making and needlework.
Students started the day with communal Jewish prayer. Classes were held on Sundays through Thursdays, instead of Mondays through Fridays, so that religious students could help their families prepare for Shabbat. On Thursday afternoons the school held Kabbalat Shabbat ceremonies, where Landau spoke to the students about the week's Torah portion. Despite the school's Jewish character, Landau came under fire from Ashkenazi rabbis, who felt that secular knowledge would lead the students to abandon religion. At the same time, the Zionists resented Landau's school for teaching both Hebrew and English and demanded that it teach only Hebrew, which Landau resisted. Notably, the Evelina School did not participate in the 1913 Palestinian Language Strike, when advocates of Hebrew language instruction urged the closing of all Jewish schools to back their cause.
World War I.
During World War I, all British citizens in Palestine were given the choice of becoming Ottoman subjects or leaving the country. As an English citizen, Landau left Palestine in 1915 for Alexandria, leaving Ella Schwartzstein as acting headmistress. In Alexandria, Landau worked with the Anglo-Egyptian authorities to provide schooling and social services for hundreds of refugee children from Palestine and Syria.
During the war, most of the teachers in the Evelina School were forced to leave and the school did not have the funds to continue operating. In 1916, the Turkish authorities in Palestine closed the school and the building was used to quarter soldiers. Landau was the first woman permitted to return to Jerusalem after General Edmund Allenby captured Jerusalem; when Landau insisted, military governor of Jerusalem Ronald Storrs, returned the school building to Anglo-Jewish Association.
1918-1945.
Landau's work as headmistress continued from her return to Jerusalem in 1918 through her death in 1945. During these years, new subjects were added to the school, specially secretarial skills that were needed by the British administration. The growth of the student body, especially the arrival of German girls in the 1930s, presented new challenges. In her later years, the Evelina School created a branch of Henrietta Szold's Youth Aliyah program and established the Schwartzstein dormitory.
Personal life.
Landau was a religious Orthodox Jew and opposed the missionary schools in Jerusalem. She never married. She remained close to her siblings and their children, including her nephew Oliver Sacks and returned annually to visit her family in London. Her close friends were Evelina School teachers who had come from England.
Death and legacy.
Landau died on 23 January 1945. She is buried on the Mount of Olives, near Henrietta Szold.
Landau was profiled in Dr. Laura Schor's "The Best School in Jerusalem: Annie Landau’s School for Girls 1900-1960" (2013).

Ma (film)

Ma is a 2019 American psychological horror film produced, co-written and directed by Tate Taylor. It stars Octavia Spencer, Juliette Lewis, Diana Silvers, Corey Fogelmanis, and Luke Evans, and follows a group of teenagers who befriend a lonely middle-aged woman. She lets them party in her basement, and they end up being terrorized by her. The film was produced by Jason Blum through his Blumhouse Productions company, along with Tate Taylor and John Norris.
Initially, "Ma" came together as a result of Taylor's desire to direct a film about "something fucked up" and Spencer's desire to break away from the kinds of roles she usually gets to play. Taylor and Spencer are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as "The Help" and "Get on Up". Later, in 2018, Taylor and Blumhouse Productions began developing the film, with Taylor directing, Landes writing, Blum producing and Spencer starring. Principal photography on the film started in February 2018 and wrapped in March 2018, in Mississippi, with some parts shot in Natchez.
"Ma" was released in the United States on May 31, 2019, by Universal Pictures. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Spencer's performance but criticized the pacing, unrealized potential, and depiction of the teenage characters. The film grossed $61.2 million against a $5 million budget.
Plot.
Teenager Maggie Thompson moves with her mother, Erica, in her Ohio hometown after Erica's husband leaves her. At her new high school, Maggie befriends Haley, Darrell, Chaz, and Andy, who immediately develops a crush on her. They convince Sue Ann "Ma" Ellington, a veterinary technician, to help them buy alcohol. Sue Ann anonymously reports their activities, but they are released because of the officer's history with Andy's father, Ben. The next day Sue Ann invites the teenagers to drink in her basement. Over time, many other teenagers arrive at her house to party, making her popular among the students.
However, the group grows annoyed as Sue Ann continuously harasses them to spend time with her. One night she drugs Maggie and takes her earrings. The next morning Maggie finds cuts and bruises on her body and her earrings missing. A scared Maggie tells Andy she no longer wants to go to Sue Ann's house and that she does not want him to go either. To earn the group's trust back, Sue Ann lies that she has pancreatic cancer. Haley notices Sue Ann wearing a bracelet belonging to a friend. The girls suspect that Sue Ann has been stealing their jewelry and break into her house to investigate. They are surprised by Genie, Sue Ann's daughter from a failed marriage; Maggie is surprised to see her walking, as she uses a wheelchair at school. Maggie and Haley escape as Sue Ann comes home.
Ben, who went to high school with Sue Ann, shows up at her job to drop off his cat and invites her out for drinks after work. At the bar, Ben confronts Sue Ann with a tracking device and asks her why his son has been at her house. Ben warns Sue Ann to stay away from Andy. A flashback reveals that Sue Ann, who had a crush on Ben, was deceived into performing fellatio on a boy she thought was Ben. Ben had gotten the school to witness the assault, including his current girlfriend Mercedes and a young Erica. Sue Ann never recovered from the trauma and humiliation.
Sue Ann runs over Mercedes with her truck, killing her. She kills her boss, draws blood from Maggie's dog Louie, and lures Ben to her house, where she knocks him out. Ben wakes up naked and tied to the bed. Sue Ann holds a large knife threatening to cut off Ben's genitalia, but instead covers it with a towel. Sue Ann compares Ben to a dog. She transfuses Louie's blood into Ben, slashes his wrist, and leaves him to bleed out and die. Maggie tells her mother the truth about Sue Ann, and Erica briefly confronts Sue Ann. Sue Ann lures Maggie with a picture of herself with Andy in her basement at Chaz's birthday party. When she arrives, only the original group remains. She tries to get Andy to leave but realizes everyone has been drugged. As Maggie tries to get help, she finds Ben's body, and is drugged by Sue Ann.
Maggie awakens chained in the basement. Sue Ann irons Chaz's stomach, sews Haley's mouth shut, and paints Darrell's face white. Andy awakens, and tries to seduce Sue Ann. After kissing, she stabs him for lying. A police officer arrives and is shot by Sue Ann after Maggie screams for help. Sue Ann forces Maggie to gather her friends and take pictures. Sue Ann attempts to hang Maggie but Genie intervenes, starting a fire in the process. Everyone else wakes up and attempt to get out as the fire spreads. Erica, knowing where Maggie likely is, and her co-worker save the teens. Sue Ann attempts to throw Genie into the fire and blames Erica for not stopping the sexual assault. Erica articulates her regrets and Maggie stabs Sue Ann, saving Genie.
The group runs outside as Sue Ann walks upstairs and cuddles with Ben's corpse as the house burns.
Production.
Development.
"Ma" came together as a result of Tate Taylor's desire to direct a film about "something fucked up", and a conversation he had with Octavia Spencer in which she told him that she was "sick of only being offered the same role and never getting to be a lead." The two are longtime friends, having worked together in films such as "The Help" and "Get on Up". Jason Blum and Taylor, who have been friends for a few years, knew each other socially.
Taylor went to Blum's office, reiterating, "I want to do something really fucked up." He read Scotty Landes' script of the film, which Blumhouse Productions had bought the day before. Although the original draft was written with a white woman in the title role, Taylor immediately thought about Spencer. He went out to the hall, called Spencer, and asked her if she would like to be in a horror film; without reading the script, Spencer boarded the project.
There was no backstory for the title character in the original script, which made her "a complete monster that no audience member could sympathize with". The filmmakers made it a priority to come up with an authentic backstory for the role. Taylor thought it was important to weave the themes of trauma, the sins of our parents, and how we treat people into the story to create a character audiences can relate to and feel bad for.
Filming.
Principal photography on the film started in February 2018. Filming took place in Mississippi, with parts shot in Natchez, and wrapped in March 2018.
Release.
"Ma" was released on May 31, 2019. The first trailer was released on February 13, 2019.
Home media.
"Ma" was released digitally on August 20, 2019, and on DVD and Blu-ray on September 3, 2019, by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment (UPHE). The film grossed $3.1 million in domestic video sales.
Reception.
Box office.
"Ma" grossed $45.9 million in the United States and Canada, and $15.3 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $61.2 million, against a production budget of $5 million.
In the United States and Canada, "Ma" was released alongside "" and "Rocketman", and was projected to gross around $20 million in its opening weekend. The film made $7.2 million on its first day, including $1.4 million from Thursday night previews. It went on to debut to $18.4 million, finishing fourth at the box office. The film made $7.8 million in its second weekend (dropping 54% and finishing in seventh), and then made $3.7 million in its third weekend.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 5.6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Octavia Spencer's performance overpowers many of "Ma"s flaws, but uneven pacing and a labored story keep this thriller from fully realizing its unhinged potential." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 53 out of 100, based on 39 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average 2.5 out of 5 stars.
Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, describing it as "a nasty yet surprisingly empathetic slab of exploitation with more than just carnage on its mind." Leah Greenblatt of "Entertainment Weekly" rated the film a grade of B, specifying, "Even as the story descends into full bloody camp at its crescendo, Spencer holds the more ludicrous plot threads together." Owen Glieberman of "Variety" wrote, "Spencer, a chameleon of an actress, does mood swings in "Ma" that leave us entertainingly off guard."
Jude Dry of "IndieWire" gave the film a grade of C, stating that "it takes an amusing premise, reduces it to its most basic parts, then weighs it down with silly scare tactics," while John DeFore of "The Hollywood Reporter" wrote, "It quickly spins its shaky premise off into an unconvincing study of emotional need and an even harder-to-believe revenge thriller."
At 2019's Saturn Awards, Spencer was nominated for Best Actress and the film was nominated for Best Thriller Film.

Kraków Ghetto Jewish Council

The Kraków Jewish Council (In German: Judenrat) was a 24-person Jewish managerial board formally established in the city of Kraków, Poland by German authorities in December 1939, and later in the Kraków Ghetto when the ghetto was officially formed on March 3, 1941. The Kraków Jewish Council formation was mandated by Nazi administration officials, who demanded that these councils be formed as supervisors of the inmates of their respective ghettos in the General Government, and in other occupied areas. The Jewish Council in Kraków was in direct contact and controlled by Nazi officials on most matters, but had some limited degree of autonomy. The Krakow Jewish council had 19 separate departments that oversaw labor, welfare, health and finance, among other items.
Along with other Jewish Councils in the General Government, the Kraków Jewish Council was established by a general decree from Hans Frank, the Governor-general of the General Government, on November 28, 1939, following a statement by Reinhard Heydrich on September 21, 1939 with similar aims . However, the Kraków Ghetto was not formally established in the Podgórze area of the Kraków District until March 3, 1941. Prior to March 3, the offices of the Jewish Council were located at 41 Kraków Street and, after the ghetto was established, the offices were located in the ghetto at the corner of Limanowski and Rynek Podgorski streets.
Organizational structure and functions.
General characteristics.
The Jewish Councils were created to serve the purposes of the Nazi regime; they had prescribed tasks by the Nazi government and ones in which they took initiative. Isaiah Trunk, author of "Judenrat: the Jewish Councils in Eastern Europe under Nazi Occupation" believes the tasks of the Jewish Councils, in general, are divided into three classes:1. Tasks imposed by the authorities, such as conduct of the census of the Jewish population, the supply of forced labor and registration of candidates for a work camp, for deportation, etc.2. Routine tasks in social welfare, medical care, and in the economic and cultural fields- tasks which were a continuation of prewar communal activities3. New tasks made essential by the complete elimination of the Jewish population in the ghetto from governmental and municipal services such as food supplies, the management of the ghetto dwellings, industry, health, police and judicial services, etc.Hans Frank and Reinhard Heydrich separate, but similar decrees defined a Jewish Council as a council of 24 Jews who are elected to their positions by the inhabitants of a particular ghetto. However, for the Kraków Jewish Council, the composition of the council greatly changed because of resignations, arrests and murders, etc. from the first council to when the Kraków Ghetto was liquidated. Local Nazi officials would directly and indirectly change the composition of the Kraków Jewish Council, when they were discontent with a particular action, and the Kraków Ghetto is known to have been greatly disadvantaged by the change in administration. The first chairman of the Kraków Jewish Council was chosen by SS-Oberscharfuhrer Mark Siebert, who ordered that role to be filled by Marek Bilberstein.
While in most cases a particular ghetto's Jewish Council served the inhabitants of that particular ghetto, there was a proposal, made by, and for the Kraków Jewish Council to become a central Jewish Council that would oversee the Ghettos in the Kraków district and act on behalf of their interests; however, nothing came of this proposition.
Administrative tasks.
Among the tasks of the Kraków Jewish Council was the establishment of housing in the city of Kraków -and later the Kraków Ghetto- for previous displaced inhabitants of Kraków and impoverished Jewish immigrants from other areas in the General Government and the Greater Reich. In the fall of 1939, the Jewish Council had to find living space for over 8,000 immigrants in the already grossly overpopulated sector of the city. During the Jewish Council’s control of the Kraków Ghetto, the Nazi ghetto officials would arbitrarily change the boundaries of the ghetto, further displacing Jews in the ghetto, which made this task for the Jewish Council especially challenging.
As mentioned, the Jewish Council sought out and coordinated housing for immigrants to its community. To highlight the ingenuity of children in the ghettos, despite the horrific conditions,14-year old Jack Gruener, who arrived with his parents and was told by the Kraków Jewish Council to share a 3-bedroom apartment with 12 other people; the lack of privacy was difficult for most families, but Jack later discovered a dwelling for him and his family in the attic of the house they were inhabiting.
Furthermore, The Kraków Jewish Council was ordered to provide a census of the Jewish population in the ghetto that included age, sex and occupation. The Jewish Council was also allowed to establish a post office in the ghetto that the council was allowed to yield a tax from. As Jews were isolated in the ghetto from the surrounding society, the Kraków Jewish Council was also given permission by the German authorities to pass judgement on certain litigation including, but not limited to, mediation between sub-tenants and tenants.
The Kraków Jewish Council was also responsible for taxing the Jews in the ghetto. This was performed by means of a regular tax and an extraordinary tax, where the former refers to a tax that all citizens, whereas the latter refers to specific taxes on items such as birth and wedding certificates and fees for the post office.
Relationships with other groups in the Kraków Ghetto.
Ghetto police.
The Kraków Ghetto Jewish Police were responsible for enforcing the decrees of the Nazis and the Jewish Council. Ghetto Jewish police were established on order of Nazi authorities, as with the Jewish councils, however, they were established by local Nazi officials, as opposed to an order from a central Nazi authority, like the decree that established the Jewish Councils. Nazi officials wanted it to appear that Jews initiated the need for a ghetto police, and so they prompted the Kraków Jewish council to ask the local militia captain (stadthauptmann) for permission, and permission was subsequently granted. Furthermore, the Jewish council was involved in choosing the ghetto police and “nepotism and graft” were highly prevalent in the selection. However, soon after the Kraków ghetto police was formed they "severed ties" with the Jewish Council.
Aid organizations.
There were other Jewish organizations that provided aid within the ghettos, and the Jewish Council would interact with their functionaries. A particular organization, the JSS (Jewish Social Welfare) agency held a conference in September 1940 that brought together the representatives from the Jewish councils of Warsaw, Radom, Lublin, Czestochowa, and Kraków that had the aim of reducing the excessive burden on forced laborers in the various camps.
Public aid.
Public health.
Communicable disease was rampant due to the unsanitary conditions of the communities and efforts were made by the Jewish council to limit those disease through public health measures. In February 1940, The Kraków Health Department was established by physicians and run by Dr. Moritz Haber, a council member. A portion of the budget was funded by the council, the rest from voluntary donations. This department oversaw the medical and hygienic care of ghetto shelters (mostly for immigrants) and the other “living section” of the ghetto. The health department also coordinated the work of 156 physicians, 110 aides, along with facilities that included an outpatient clinic, radiology institute, a communicable disease station (as mandated by German authorities), and the only pharmacy in the Kraków Ghetto, although it only provided basic medicines. In September 1940, a mere 36 patients were admitted to the hospital with infectious diseases, which was a result of the measures in place by the Jewish Council. Lastly, to compensate for loss of public health officials, the Jewish Council, in the summer of 1940 operated a training course for hygiene personnel where 63 lectures and 5 day practical course was conducted for education on the fundamentals of hygiene theory.
Welfare.
In the ghettos, there were a few different relief organizations that were involved in welfare operations in the ghettos, such as Jewish Social Welfare (JSS) which worked in the General Government areas, along with the Jewish Councils. However, the JSS welfare in Kraków, and later in the Kraków ghetto was limited because Nazi officials limited the amount of aid they could provide.The Kraków Jewish council provided welfare in the form of soup kitchens, cash payouts and medicine.
Resistance to German orders.
Considering the immense power of the Nazi authority and the belief that obedience was the best solution to maintain viability of Jewish life, the Jewish Council complied with most of the Nazi decrees. However, there were certain important instances of resistance. The first council chairman, Marek Biberstein, a teacher and a public activist, was arrested, along with four other council members, for disobeying the expulsion orders of May 1940 to April 1941. Biberstein and two others from the council were sentenced to jail. Furthermore, the second council chairman, Dr. Artur Rosenzweig, was arrested and he and his family were sent to Belzec Extermination camp, since Nazi ghetto officials were unhappy with the “number and technique of delivery of people to the assembly square” for the resettlement of June 1942 to extermination and labor camps. Nazi ghetto officials then made David Gutter, the last chairman of the Kraków Ghetto.

MoTrip

Mohamed El Moussaoui (), known by the stage name MoTrip (born March 7, 1988), is a German rapper of Lebanese descent. His stage name uses the first syllable of his name and plays off the Arabic word for "singer" or "lyricist". MoTrip came into his own with hits such as 2013's "Guten Morgen NSA" ("Good Morning NSA") and his 2015 song "So wie du bist" ("Just as you are"). Since 2011, he has been under contract with Universal Music.
Early life.
Mohamed El Moussaoui was born in Beirut, Lebanon, though his family fled the country during the Lebanese Civil War. He grew up in Aachen, at Germany's borders with Belgium and the Netherlands. El Moussaoui's older brother was also a rapper and the young MoTrip began writing his first lyrics at the age of 15. Aachen was also the hometown of Turkish-German rapper Kool Savas, who took notice of the up-and-coming MoTrip. With the promotion of Kool Savas, MoTrip was able to make important industry connections and promote his work.
Career.
According to MoTrip, he has written or contributed to writing many German-language rap tracks performed by other artists. He says that all of the lyrics he performs, however, are his own words. While MoTrip has not indicated for whom he has written music, in 2011, German rapper Eko Fresh claimed on Twitter that MoTrip wrote the Fler album "Airmax Muzik II". MoTrip is also credited as a co-author on the 2012 album "AMYF" by Berlin rapper Bushido.
MoTrip's first album, "Embryo", was released in 2011. His first charting single did not come until his 2013 song "Guten Morgen NSA" ("Good Morning NSA"). In the context of the United States' National Security Agency spying controversy, MoTrip mocked NSA surveillance for hacking his Game Boy. Comparing the NSA to the 'Stasi', the official state security service of East Germany, MoTrip was echoing a comparison first made by German chancellor Angela Merkel. The song also remarks on MoTrip's status as an Arab in Europe.
The 2015 album "Mama" featured the hit single "So wie du bist" ("Just as you are"), which became MoTrip's highest charting song, reaching number 3 on the German charts. The track featured German vocalist Lary who appeared as a stripper in the music video, romantically pursued by MoTrip. The song remained at number 51 on the charts until it was featured as background music for a Beats by Dre commercial, which focused on German football player Bastian Schweinsteiger and his departure from long-time club Bayern Munich to join Manchester United. The commercial catapulted the song to the top of the charts.

Tehilla-Evelina de Rothschild Secondary School

The Tehilla-Evelina de Rothschild Secondary School is a public Jewish Reform secondary school for girls, located in the Old City of Jerusalem, Israel. Founded in 1854 as the Evelina de Rothschild School, it was the first Jewish school for girls in Israel, and at the time had a Jewish Orthodox philosophy.
In 2007 it was reported that Orthodox Jewish girls schools, including the Evelina de Rothschild School, were facing falling enrolments due the demand for liberal Orthodox Jewish schools for girls. In 2011, the school merged with Tehilla Religious Girls' School, and the Jerusalem Municipality took a financial interest.
History.
The school was founded in 1854 in the Old City of Jerusalem by Dr Albert Cohen. The students learned domestic tasks such as sewing and knitting. Baron Lionel de Rothschild became the school's patron in 1867, naming it after his daughter Evelina who had died the previous year. The Anglo-Jewish Association took control of the school in 1962, out of a desire to influence the developing cultural character of Israel, although the baron continued to make a donation of £800 to the school every year. 
The school served a diverse population; there were both Ashkenazi and Sephardi students, as well as students who were Moroccan, Karaite, and Armenian Christian. The school was overseen by the nearby Rothschild Hospital, in the Old City of Jerusalem. In 1886, Dr. Yitzchak Schwartz, who oversaw the hospital, submitted the following report regarding the school: 
Administration.
When in 1888 the Rothschild Hospital moved into a larger building outside of the Old City, the Rothschilds appointed Fortunée Behar as the school's first headmistress. When Behar resigned in 1899, Annie Landau became the new headmistress of the school. She was awarded an MBE on the occasion of the King’s birthday by Sir Herbert Samuel, British High Commissioner in 1924. Landau served as the headmistress from 1899–1945. When she died in 1945, vice principal Ethel Levy took over the position, leading the school through the tumultuous establishment of the State of Israel. Levy retired in 1960. Dr. Beverly Gribetz was awarded a Sylvan Adams Nefesh B’Nefesh Bonei Zion Prize in 2019 for her work as principal of the Evelina de Rothschild-Tehilla Secondary School.

Navy Office (Royal Navy)

The Navy Office was the government office charged with responsibility for the day-to-day civil administration of the British Royal Navy from (1576-1832). It contained all the members of the Navy Board and various other departments and offices. The day-to-day business of the Navy Office was administered by Clerk of the Acts from 1660 until 1796, who was responsible for the organisation of the office and management of its staff. When his office was abolished his duties were assumed by separate committees for Accounts, Correspondence, Stores, Transports and Victualling who were, in turn, presided over by the Comptroller of the Navy until 1832. It was one of two government offices (the other being the Department of Admiralty) that were jointly responsible for directing naval affairs. In 1832 following reforms of the naval service the Navy Office was abolished all of its functions and staff were merged within the Admiralty.
History.
In 1576 the Navy Office replaced the Office of the Council of the Marine. It was initially located at Deptford for most of the sixteenth century. It later moved to collection of offices in the Tower Hill area of London until around 1654. The office then moved to a new building at the crossroad of Crutched Friars and Seething Lane. Until 1628 following the creation of the Board of Admiralty the Navy Office was an independent advisory office to the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office when it became a subsidiary yet autonomous component of that office. In 1673 the office was destroyed by a fire and a new building was constructed to house its staff that took 10 years to complete. The Navy Office continued to be based in Tower Hill until 1786 when it relocated to a much large office space at Somerset House where it remained until it was abolished in 1832. The primary organisation within the office was the Navy Board and the various offices of its principal commissioners. However, the Treasurer of the Navy although a principal member of the board administered a separate Navy Pay Office. From 1567 until 1660 the office was administered by the Comptroller of the Navy. In 1660 the Clerk of the Acts became responsible for the organisation of the Navy Office. In 1796 administration of the Navy Office was placed under the supervision of three Committees, of Correspondence, Accounts and Stores. Throughout its history its clerical supporting staff consisting of chief clerks then first, second and third class clerks were assigned to the various offices and departments within the Navy Office. In 1808 the Naval Works Department was relocated from the Admiralty to the Navy Office. A Ticket and Wages Branch was formed in 1829. In 1832 the Navy Office and subsequently the Navy Board were abolished its functions were then transferred to the Department of Admiralty under supervision of the Board of Admiralty.
Organisation and structure of the Navy Office.
The Navy Office provided accommodation for the Commissioners of the Navy Board and senior clerical and secretarial staff, as well as office space. Different branches, departments and offices were located within different parts of the Navy Office in London, England. Royal Navy Dockyards both in the United Kingdom and overseas were also part of this office.
Components of the Navy Office.
The Navy Office consisted of a number of specific component parts that included:
Boards.
The Navy Board and formerly known as the Council of the Marine or Council of the Marine Causes was the organisation with responsibility for the day-to-day civil administration of the Royal Navy between 1546 and 1832. Its principal officers and commissioners were headquartered in the Navy Office.
Dockyards.
Oversight of all Royal Navy Dockyards that were part of the Navy Office were normally supervised by a resident commissioner of the navy board at their respective yards, these commissioners did not normally attend Navy Board meetings in London; nevertheless, they were full members of the Navy Board. After the abolition of the Navy Board and subsequently the Navy Office in 1832 responsibility for the management of the dockyards passed to the Board of Admiralty.
United Kingdom and Ireland dockyards.
Other minor yards (with some permanent staff and minor repair/storage facilities, but without dry docks etc.) were established in a number of locations over time, usually to serve a nearby anchorage used by naval vessels.

Giovanni Delfino (camerlengo)

Cardinal Giovanni Dolfin, often Italianized as Delfin or Delfino (Venice, 15 December 1545 - Venice, 25 November 1622), was an Italian politician and cardinal. He was one of several cardinals from his family by this name. He is the uncle of Cardinal Giovanni Delfino (iuniore).
Graduated in "utroque jure" at the University of Padua, he seemed to want to embrace the ecclesiastical state, but was instead initiated into a political and diplomatic career; after having exercised some minor offices in Venice, in 1577 he was appointed podestà and captain of Belluno.
Between 1582 and 1595 he was sent as ambassador of the Republic of Venice to Poland, Spain, Germany and France, whence he returned eight years later to go to the role of ambassador to the Holy See, a post he held until 1598. In the same year he officially represented Venice at the wedding of Philip III of Spain and in 1601 to those of Henry IV of France and Maria de' Medici.
Returning to his homeland he took the post of San Marco's attorney and the reformer of Studio Padovano.
In 1603, the Bishop of Vicenza remained vacant, Pope Clement VIII decided to assign him to Dolfin, to whom he was bound by ties of sympathy and mutual respect, although he was not a priest and the Venetian law did not allow ecclesiastical offices to be held by those who they had resided at the court of Rome. On 27 Dec 1603, he was consecrated bishop by Alfonso Visconti, Bishop of Spoleto, with Tommaso Contarini, Archbishop of Candia, and Leonardo Mocenigo, Bishop of Ceneda, serving as co-consecrators.

While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of:

Giovanni Delfino (cardinal)

Giovanni Dolfin (or Delfino) (Venice, 22 April 1617 - Udine, 20 July 1699) was an Italian Catholic Cardinal and playwright.
The nephew of the other cardinal Giovanni Delfino (seniore), he was the first senator of the Venetian republic, then, after abandoning civil and religious life, after various ecclesiastical duties he was consecrated titular bishop of Tagaste on 30 November 1656 by Carlo Carafa della Spina, Bishop of Aversa. In 1656 Girolamo Gradenigo wanted him as coadjutor in the Patriarchate of Aquileia. He succeeded him, as patriarch, two years later.
On the request of the Republic of Venice, on 8 March 1667 Pope Alexander VII appointed him cardinal of San Salvatore in Lauro and then of the Saints Vito, Modesto and Crescenzia. He was abbot commendatore of the abbey of Rosazzo from 1668 until his death.
He participated in the conclave of 1667, that of 1669-1670, that of 1676, that of 1689 and finally that of 1691; indeed during the latter his name re-entered among those of the papabili but his election was blocked by the Spaniards who did not see favorably a Venetian on the papal throne.
While bishop, he was the principal consecrator of Alvise Sagredo, Patriarch of Venice (1678).
Plays.
"Four tragedies he wrote, Cleopatra (1660), Lucrezia, Medoro and Creso, which, although not entirely exempt from the defects of the century, for the nobility of the style nonetheless and for the conduct may be the best glues from the previous age. But he never wanted them to be published. The Cleopatra was first printed in the Italian Theater of the March. Maffei. So all four came to light, but very bad and battered, in Utrecht in 1730, until a much more correct and magnificent edition was made by Comino in Padua in 1733 together with an apologetic speech of the cardinal himself in defense of his Tragedies. Six dialogues in verse of this most learned cardinal were then printed in which they appear to be very well versed in the modern philosophy of those times without completely abandoning the prejudices of the old. But their style is not 'noble and supported as in the tragedies".
He was also the author of poems, of reflections on Tacitus and Sallust, and of ten prose dialogues of scientific subject, of which only one - dedicated to astronomy - was published.
He is buried in Venice in the church of San Michele di Murano.

I Can See Your Voice

I Can See Your Voice (abbreviated ICSYV and stylized as I Can See Your Voice — Mystery music game show) () is an international television mystery music game show franchise. It is originated in South Korea as a program of the same name.
History.
In 2012, producer and creator Lee Seon-young planned to develop a music game show. Besides with the existence of "good singers", she added "bad singers" and lip sync as format elements. Also, she was originally envisioned a program that will allow anyone to be the main character regardless of their appearances, and was inspired by Kim Bum-soo who struggled to gain recognition because of his look.
On February 26, 2015, "I Can See Your Voice" began to air on Mnet alongside with simulcast on tvN. Dubbed as the "mystery music game show", it proved to be an instant success in South Korea. This format comes with a "fusion of music and guessing game concepts" would later adopt to similar shows such as "Masked Singer", "", and "Super Hearer".
Due to its unique format, it was later sold to different countries, which distributed by CJ ENM and several syndicated television productions.
Gameplay.
Format.
A guest artist (also includes a contestant) are presented with a group of "mystery singers" — some of them are good singers, and some are bad. The artist must attempt to eliminate bad singers from the group by guessing who they are without hearing them sing. They get assistance from clues by "celebrity panelists" over the course of each round. The artist will eliminate one to two singers at the end of each round and then proceeding to perform on the "stage of truth". At the end, the winning mystery singer is revealed as good or bad by means of a duet with one of the guest artists. The artist wins the game if a good singer remains at the end of the show and the winning mystery singer receives a "reward".
In other franchises, a non-celebrity contestant plays the game. The contestant gets a cash prize for every bad singer eliminated. At the penultimate round, they may choose to walk away with the earned money if they think that the last mystery singer is a bad singer, or to risk it all for a chance to take home the jackpot prize, otherwise.
Rounds.
The original format of this game consists of four main rounds with varying mechanics.
Singer's lip sync.
Each mystery singer performs a lip sync to a song. Good singers are miming to own voices while bad singers are miming to other's voices.
Singer's evidence.
Each mystery singer reveals an evidential piece. Good singers have own evidences while bad singers have their evidences fabricated.
Singer's interrogation.
The guest artist must interrogate to each mystery singer. Good singers tell the truth while bad singers fabricate own reality.
Reception.
Legacy.
"I Can See Your Voice" served as a launchpad for mystery singers including Hwang Chi-yeul, Lee Sun-bin, and Kim Min-kyu; gaining much success following the show. International artists such as Sephy Francisco, Ninety One, and also gained recognition through the program.
Controversies.
In August 2015, CJ ENM accused two Chinese programs, "God of Songs" by SZTV and "X-Singer" by Beijing TV of plagiarism, which imitates its gameplay similar to ICSYV, therefore they were both declared as unlicensed Chinese adaptations. Despite this, "God of Songs" became successful due to high ratings and even trending on social media.
During an interview with CJ ENM head of formats Diane Min in June 2020, it was revealed that there was a dispute with "Is That Really Your Voice?", another game show format by the Turkey-based Global Agency in 2013, in which "I Can See Your Voice" was accused as being plagiarized from their format. Despite this, it was later adapted in three countries.
Accolades.
"I Can See Your Voice" was both nominated for Best Non-Scripted Entertainment Program category at the 44th International Emmy Awards and Best Light Entertainment Program category at the 2020 Venice TV Awards.
International adaptations.
Since 2016, the ICSYV franchise has spawned 33 adaptations airing in 33 countries and territories. The Vietnamese program "Giọng ải giọng ai" (also called "Hidden Voices") has a similar gameplay to ICSYV but under "versus format", is officially recognized as part of the latter franchise because of its uniqueness which was later adopted to ICSYV counterparts.

Marine Drive Tunnel

The Marine Drive Tunnel is a proposed tunnel which will connect Marine Drive in Kollupitiya to the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC). The Cabinet of Sri Lanka has approved the signing of the MOU in January 2018.
Route.
The tunnel would begin at the northern-end of Marine Drive, before connecting to the CIFC after passing under Galle Face Green. Preliminary assessments are also currently underway to further extend the road connection to the Colombo Harbour and the New Kelani Bridge, where the existing E03 expressway begins, before terminating at the Bandaranaike International Airport. The extension may be built as a continuation of the tunnel or as an elevated highway. The construction of the tunnel will also further expand the Galle Face Green towards the ocean.

Raecia gens

The gens Raecia, also spelled Racia, was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned at the time of the Second Punic War. Marcus Raecius was praetor in 170 BC. However, after this the family fell into obscurity until imperial times.
Origin.
The nomen "Raecius" appears to be of Oscan origin, indicating that the Raecii were probably descended from one of the Oscan-speaking peoples of central and southern Italy, such as the Sabines or the Samnites. The nomen "Racilia" may have been derived from "Raecia", using the common diminutive suffix "".
Branches and cognomina.
None of the Raecii who appear in history during the Republic bore any cognomen, but the Raecii of imperial times used a variety of common surnames. "Taurus", a bull, "Gallus", a cockerel, and "Leo", a lion, belong to a common type of cognomina derived from the names of familiar objects and animals. "Rufus", red, was usually bestowed on someone with red hair, while "Constans" indicated someone steadfast or faithful.

Thagaste (diocese)

The Diocese of Thagaste is an ancient and famous Titular See of the Roman Catholic Church.
The ancient Roman town of Tagaste, corresponding to the city of Souk Ahras in Algeria, was the seat of an ancient episcopal diocese during the Roman and Vandal empires in what was the Roman province of Numidia.
Tagaste is famous for being the birthplace of Augustine, who was a bishop in nearby Hippo (now Annaba), and his mother, Monica. Near Tagaste, Saint Melanie the young founded two monasteries in one of the vast possessions of her property in Roman Africa, where she lived a few years before going to Jerusalem where she died in 439.
The first known bishop of Tagaste is Fermo, who suffered martyrdom in the late 3rd century and is remembered by the Vetus Martyrologium Romanum on 31 July: "Tagaste, in Africa, sancti Firmi Episcopi, confessionis gloria conspicui". St. Augustine mentions it in the work The lie.
The next known bishop is Alypius, a disciple and friend of Augustine, also remembered by "Vetus Martyrologium Romanum" on August 15.In Alipio Augustin dedicates three chapters of the book VI of his Confessions. 
The third known bishop of Tagaste is Gennaro, who participated in the synod gathered in Carthage by the Huneric the Vandal in 484, after which he was exiled.
Today, Tagaste survives as a titular bishop's seat; the current archbishop, personal title, holder is Ivo Scapolo, apostolic nuncio to Portugal.

Canal Rocks

Canal Rocks is a series of granite rocks in the Indian Ocean just off the coast situated approximately south of Yallingup in the South West region of Western Australia. The Noongar name for this place is Winjee Sam.
The rock formation takes its name from the narrow channel between the rocks that has formed from the coastal waters eroding the granite-gneiss away over time. The rocks that make up the canals are part of the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge, or Leeuwin complex. The rocks that make up the feature consist of hornblende-biotite monzogranite gneiss that are medium to coarse-grained and moderately foliated containing minerals such as perthite, quartz, hornblende with accessory biotite, opaques, apatite, and zircon. The original rock that underwent medium metamorphism was granite. The estimated age of crystallisation is 702 ± 7 million years.
The Cape to Cape Track passes near the lookout over the rocks.
Facilities at the site include a car park, boat ramp, finger jetty and a walkway to access the closest rock formation. A small, unpatrolled beach is found to the lee-side of the rocks with low to subtidal sand and patchy rock reefs.
The road through to the site, which was already a popular fishing and recreational area, was constructed in 1907 from Caves Road.

James E. Agnew

James E. Agnew was an American politician who served as a Boston City Councilor, Massachusetts Fish and Game Commissioner, and Corporation Counsel of Boston.
Early life.
Agnew was born in South Boston. His parents were from Carrickmacross. His father died when Agnew was 16 and he became head of his family. He worked at a department store, first as an office boy, then as a salesman. He also pursued musical training and eventually formed his own orchestra. Music provided Agnew with enough money to fund his studies at the Boston University School of Law. His education was interrupted by World War I. He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps and was assigned to the morale section. After the war he toured veteran's hospitals and other places were servicemen met. He made enough money to go back to law school. He graduated in 1926.
Political career.
In 1931, Agnew ran for Boston City Council in Ward 21. He finished second in the eight candidate race behind incumbent James Hein.
In 1933, he was elected to represent Brighton. In 1938 he was nominated by Governor Charles F. Hurley for the position of director of Fisheries and Game. Agnew chose to remain on the council, but stated that he would not run for reelection. He was confirmed by the Massachusetts Governor's Council on January 3, 1939. That same day, he was a candidate for city council president. His election was opposed a group of eight freshmen councilors and one second term member (Mildred Harris), who voted for William J. Galvin. Agnew and Galvin each had nine votes, while the three Republican councilors refused to vote for either.
Agnew withdrew from the race on January 13, citing his added duties as Fish and Game Commissioner. He backed George A. Murray, who went on to win the presidency on the 11th ballot. In 1942, Agnew was the Democratic nominee for Massachusetts Attorney General. He lost to Republican Robert T. Bushnell 56% to 43%. During World War II, Agnew served as a special assistant United States attorney investigating war fraud. In 1945, Governor Maurice J. Tobin nominated Agnew for the position of conservation commissioner.
Agnew refused the appointment and two months later accepted the position of corporation council of Boston. In 1950 he was a candidate for clerk of the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. The sixteen-candidate race was won by Chester A. Dolan Jr.
Death.
Agnew died on October 30, 1956, in Boston following a long illness. He was 65 years old.

Marcus Arethusius

Marcus Arethusius was an ancient Christian author who wrote a confession of faith, promulgated in the Third Council of Sirmium in the year 359, and was subsequently martyred under the Roman emperor Julian.
Other works describe his transgression as having torn down a pagan temple to replace it with a Christian church. Knowing this would provoke the ire of the authorities, he prepared to flee, but on learning that his family and friends were being punished in his stead, surrendered himself. He was, according to these works, beaten and stabbed and hung in the sun covered in honey for the insects to eat, until he would agree to restore the pagan temple, or to pay for its restoration. After a time, his captors grew to know he would not relent, and set him free.

He commanded Bombing Squadron 109, a Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator bombing squadron in the Pacific Theatre with the rank of Commander. Under his leadership, his squadron established the best record of destruction against enemy shipping and island bases of any land-based Navy search squadron in the Pacific.
Biography.
Miller was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on February 1, 1908. He attended Richard J. Reynolds High School and graduated on 1926. He entered the United States Naval Academy on June 20, 1927, and was commissioned an Ensign in the U.S. Navy on June 4, 1931, upon his graduation.
For his service in World War II, he received a letter of congratulation from Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz, which says: "It is enough to say that the enemy will be glad you have left the forward area. Congratulations on an outstanding tour of combat duty. Well done."&gt;
On September 1945, VPB-109 returned to NAS San Diego and was disestablished on 12 October 1945.
Miller remained in active duty, when the war ended on August 15, 1945 with the surrender of Japan. On 1946, he was admitted to Corona Naval Hospital in Corona, due to tuberculosis he contracted in the South Pacific.

Navy Cross citation.
The President of the United States of America takes pleasure in presenting the Navy Cross to Commander Norman Mickey Miller, United States Navy, for extraordinary heroism in operations against the enemy while serving as Commander of a Navy PB4Y Patrol Plane Commanding Officer of Patrol-Bombing Squadron ONE HUNDRED NINE (VPB-109), in action on 16 May 1944, at Truk Lagoon. During a long-range reconnaissance flight to Truk, Commander Miller spotted a 5,000-ton freighter anchored in the lagoon. He made a beam attack, releasing three bombs at masthead height, heavily damaging the vessel. He then spotted a 10,000-ton ship that immediately exploded after his bomb run, destroying a large portion of the vessel. He then proceeded on to Puluwat, arriving over the Japanese airfield at minimum altitude, surprised and strafed a formation of 30 enemy soldiers. In this attack he destroyed one truck, an aircraft revetment and dropped two bombs on a radio station. In his last bomb run on the radio station the Liberator was hit four times by AA fire, one exploding directly above the cockpit, wounding both Commander Miller and his second pilot. Despite his wounds and damage to the aircraft, Commander Miller flew the Liberator 800 miles back to base for a safe landing. His outstanding courage and determined skill were at all times inspiring and in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

Greig &amp; Beadon's Patent Light Railway

Greig &amp; Beadon's Patent Light Railway was a patented system of narrow gauge locomotives and rolling stock.
History.
Locomotives built by John Fowler for light railway systems had small wheels and as a result apparently suffered initially from their working parts being too near to the ground, and so being exposed to dust and dirt. In July 1880, his employees Alfred Greig and William Beadon were granted a patent for a locomotive with a jackshaft drive, which meant the cylinders could be raised much further above the track. It had very short vertical coupling rod from the jackshaft to the rear axle just below it; the rod was cranked to allow the valve eccentrics to be mounted inboard of the crank. The gearing arrangement had been patented, which regulated the speed and movement of the engine.
In South Africa, India, Australia, China, the Straits Settlements, West Indies, Hawaiian Islands and other places, the gauge was to , the locomotives weighed 7 or 8 tons and could carry safely a load of 80 tons at a speed of . A light railway of still narrower gauge to connect farms with a main line of light railway could be built for $1,000 a mile while offering great benefit to farmers, if there was plenty of produce to be carried. Under the Greig system of light railways the cost was $5,000 a mile outside of England, while in England the cost was increased to $7,500 to $10,000 a mile, on account of preliminary Parliamentary expenses and increased cost of right of way.
Approximately eleven of these jackshaft drive locomotives were delivered to sugar plantations in the Hawaiian islands. The first Australian one was a gauge example purchased by John Spiller for his River Estate in 1881. Airdmillan Mill in the Burdekin District imported a gauge 0-4-2T Fowler Patent locomotive in 1882. In 1882, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company imported at least two Fowler Patent 2-4-0T locomotives for their new Victoria Mill. A 0-4-2T Patent locomotive imported by the Mourilyan Sugar Company in 1883 has been preserved at the Australian Sugar Museum, the only surviving example of its type in the world. In all, about a dozen Patent locomotives were imported by sugar mills in Queensland. Fowler patent locos 4666 to 4667 of 1883 were supplied to Chile via W. &amp; J. Lockett, who were active agents and ship-owners in Chile and Peru.
Steam, gas, electricity and oil could be used to operate the engines. It was said that oil presented the advantage of freedom from noise, smoke and sparks, which was an important point when there are many stacks and hay fields along the line. Only one man was required to manage the engine, and, if the supply of oil ran short, a fresh supply could be got at almost every village through which the line ran. A great deal of interest has been taken in light railways, but certain proposed speed regulations have hampered promoters in getting capital interested.

Sum coloring

In graph theory, a sum coloring of a graph is a labeling of its vertices by positive integers, with no two adjacent vertices having equal labels, that minimizes the sum of the labels. The minimum sum that can be achieved is called the chromatic sum of the graph. Chromatic sums and sum coloring were introduced by Supowit in 1987 using non-graph-theoretic terminology, and first studied in graph theoretic terms by Ewa Kubicka (independently of Supowit) in her 1989 doctoral thesis.
Obtaining the chromatic sum may require using more distinct labels than the chromatic number of the graph, and
even when the chromatic number of a graph is bounded, the number of distinct labels needed to obtain the optimal chromatic sum may be arbitrarily large.
Computing the chromatic sum is NP-hard. However it may be computed in linear time for trees and pseudotrees, and in polynomial time for outerplanar graphs. There is a constant-factor approximation algorithm for interval graphs and for bipartite graphs. The interval graph case remains NP-hard. It is the case arising in Supowit's original application in VLSI design, and also has applications in scheduling.

Marcus Ostorius Scapula (consul 59)

Marcus Ostorius Scapula (died AD 65) was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was suffect consul in the second half of the year 59 as the colleague of Titus Sextius Africanus. He was the son of Publius Ostorius Scapula, governor of Roman Britain (47-52).
Scapula first appears in history as a soldier in one of the units stationed in his father's province of Roman Britain. During a battle against the Iceni, the younger Ostorius Scapula saved a fellow soldier's life and was afterwards awarded the civic crown. It is possible he had been commissioned a military tribune; in any case, his career after this point until he achieved the consulate is unknown. In 62, Scapula was involved in a legal suit where the praetor Antistius Sosianus was accused of violating the "lex maiestas" by composing verses mocking Nero which Sosianus recited at a large gathering at Scapula's house. Although Scapula claimed he had heard nothing, several witnesses present at the time were produced who attested Sosianus had recited the verses, and the accused was found guilty and punished with exile.
When Sosianus was recalled from exile three years later, according to Tacitus, he learned that the occupation of "delator", or informer, was favored by the emperor Nero, and Sosianus accused Scapula of seeking to make himself emperor. Nero readily believed him. At the time Scapula was living on a remote estate on the Ligurian border, whence a centurion was dispatched to ensure Scapula's death. Thus pressured, Ostorius Scapula took his own life.

See (TV series)

See is an American science fiction drama television series produced for Apple TV+ starring Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard in leading roles. It is written by Steven Knight and directed by Francis Lawrence. It also stars Sylvia Hoeks, Hera Hilmar and Christian Camargo. Executive producers include Knight, Lawrence, Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, and Kristen Campo. The series premiered on November 1, 2019, and was renewed for a second season, but filming was temporarily delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming concluded on March 18, 2021, with the second season premiering on August 27, 2021. It was renewed for a third season in June 2021.
Premise.
In the early twenty-first century, a virus wiped out all but two million humans, those surviving having lost their sense of sight. "See" takes place several centuries later, where society has found new ways to socially interact, build, hunt, and survive without vision. In the mountains, Baba Voss, the Chieftain of the Alkenny Tribe, takes in and marries a woman, Maghra, who comes to the Alkenny seeking shelter. Baba Voss has been unable to father children, and the woman is three months pregnant when she first arrives. 
The biological father, Jerlamarel, is an outlaw wanted by the Queen of the Kane dynasty of Kanzua Dam for the heresy of being "sighted" (the natural ability to see). Word spreads of Jerlamarel siring children, prompting a witch hunt for Jerlamarel and his young superior offspring. Baba Voss must protect both his family and his tribe against the Queen's army.
"Alkenny" and "Kanzua" are alterations of Allegheny and Kinzua, real-life locations in present-day western Pennsylvania.
Production.
Development.
On January 10, 2018, it was announced that Apple had given the production a series order for a single eight-episode season. The series was written by Steven Knight and directed by Francis Lawrence, both of whom also executive produce alongside Peter Chernin, Jenno Topping, and Kristen Campo. Production companies involved with the series consist of Chernin Entertainment and Endeavor Content.
On November 7, 2019, Apple ordered a second season of the series. A third season renewal came on June 10, 2021, prior to the second season premiere.
Casting.
A July 2018 announcement revealed that Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard had been cast in series regular roles, followed by news that Yadira Guevara-Prip, Nesta Cooper, Sylvia Hoeks, and Archie Madekwe had joined the main cast a month later. On October 18, 2018, it was reported that Christian Camargo and Hera Hilmar had been cast in series regular roles. Oliver Rae Aleron and Spencer Prewett from Archspire appear in a cameo in the first episode. In January 2020, it was announced that Dave Bautista would be joining the series for season 2, playing the brother of Baba Voss. In February 2020, news followed that Adrian Paul would also be joining the cast, playing a character named Lord Harlan, though Tom Mison would end up taking that role.
In October 2020, it was announced that Jason Momoa's former "Stargate Atlantis" castmate, Joe Flanigan, had been cast in the second season of the show. In June 2021, it was announced Eden Epstein, Tom Mison, Hoon Lee, Olivia Cheng, David Hewlett and Tamara Tunie had joined Bautista as new series regulars for the second season.
Filming.
Principal photography for the first season commenced on September 17, 2018 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and ended on February 8, 2019. In October 2018, filming was reported to be taking place in Coquitlam, Eagle Mountain, North Vancouver (water shed), Rutheford service road, Pemberton, Deroche, Delta at Boundary Bay, Mission, Squamish Valley, Youth Detention Center Burnaby, Allouette in Mapleridge and the Campbell River and Strathcona Provincial Park areas of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.
Filming for the second season was expected to begin on February 3, 2020 and end on July 10, 2020. However, in March 2020, production was shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2020, it was reported that "See" would resume filming on October 14, 2020 in Toronto, Ontario. The second season finished filming on March 18, 2021.
Prior to the premiere of season two, the show was renewed for a third season with filming that began in May 2021 and is expected to conclude by October 2021.
Release.
During Apple WWDC 2021, a sizzle reel included footage from the second season. A few days later, on June 10, 2021, a teaser for the second season was revealed along with the release of August 27, 2021.
Reception.
Critical response.
The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season a 44% approval rating based on 52 reviews, with an average rating of 5.30/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Though its capable cast is clearly game, an over-reliance on gore and a grimly—and at times comically—convoluted narrative blurs "See"s bold vision." On Metacritic the series has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100 based on reviews from 25 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Rotten Tomatoes gave the second season a 83% approval rating based on 6 reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10.
"Variety"'s Daniel D'Addario was critical of the show, saying it: "Wastes the time of Jason Momoa and Alfre Woodard, among others, on a story that starts from a position of fun, giddy strangeness and drags itself forward at a lugubrious pace."
Ben Travers at IndieWire responded positively: "Steven Knight's action-drama is a strange-but-effective blend" and "the balance isn't quite there yet, as episodes don't exactly earn their hourlong run time. Momoa, meanwhile, fits the role well."

Ewa Kubicka

Ewa Maria Kubicka is a Polish mathematician interested in graph theory and actuarial science. She is known for introducing the concept of the chromatic sum of a graph, the minimum possible sum when the vertices are labeled by natural numbers with no two adjacent vertices having equal labels.
Kubicka studied mathematics at Wrocław University of Science and Technology beginning in 1974, and earned a master's degree there in 1979. She came to Western Michigan University for graduate study, earning both a master's degree in computer science and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1989.

John Jacob Lavranos

John Jacob Lavranos (29 March 1926, in Corfu – 1 February 2018, in Portugal) was a Greek/South African insurance broker and botanist, with a special interest in succulents. 
John's mother, Lily, was half Swiss/German, and lived for most of her married life in the family house in Chlomos in Corfu. She and her husband Philip cared for John and his younger brother, Max, saw the occupation of Corfu during WWII, and lived through the bombings by Italians, Germans, British and Americans, only to be plunged immediately into the Greek Civil War of 1946 to 1949.
At the end of the War having served in the Greek Navy, John studied economics and law at the University of Athens, earning a B.Sc. (Econ.) degree in 1948. He arrived in South Africa in September 1952 with his first wife, Helen, and started work as an insurance broker. In 1967 he studied for a B.Sc. in Natural Science through the University of South Africa, and the following year enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand for an M.Sc. degree in botany and geography.
Over a period of more than 50 years John Lavranos undertook numerous visits to remote regions in southern Arabia, Somalia and Socotra, Kenya and Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, Reunion Island, Mauritius, Canary Islands, Greece, and in his final years, the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Chile. His trips through South Africa included Namaqualand, Mpumalanga, and the Richtersveld. He discovered and described many new species of succulent plants, collaborating with organisations such as the National Museum of Natural History (France), the Institute of Tropical Botany of Florence, Kew Gardens, Jardin Exotique de Monaco, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. His contributions were published mainly in the 'Cactus &amp; Succulent Journal', and he confined himself to Asclepiadaceae, Pelargoniums, Aloes and other succulents. His collection of pressed specimens numbered some 32 000, and he described or co-described approximately 180 taxa.
He settled in Loulé, a city near Faro in the Algarve region of southern Portugal in 1995 and donated most of his plants to the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens. Maintaining his passion for plants, he continued an active correspondence with other botanists, often setting aside time for succulent enthusiasts.
He is commemorated in the genus "Lavrania" in the family Apocynaceae, "Aloe lavranosii" Reynolds, "Eriospermum lavranosii" P.L.Perry, "Caralluma lavranii" Rauh &amp; Wertel, "Sarcocaulon lavranii" Halda, "Phagnalon lavranosii" Qaiser &amp; Lack "Aloe lavranosii" is from Yemen and is unusual in being hairy with yellow-green flowers.
"Crassula susannae" was named for Suzanne Lavranos, the second wife of John Lavranos. "Caralluma mireillae" Lavranos, was named after John's third wife, Mireille, who died in 2014, and whom he had met in Djibouti. She was very supportive of his botanical explorations and often accompanied him. All three of John's marriages were childless.
John was known to be pragmatic, forthright, precise, energetic, and with a lively sense of humour. His knowledge of botany and geology was formidable, and this extended to climatology, geography, astronomy, history and music - he was an accomplished pianist earlier in his life. Despite being an agnostic his biblical knowledge was extensive. He was a polyglot and comfortable in Ancient Greek and Latin, and fluent in Greek, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Afrikaans. He succumbed in Loulé, Portugal following a stroke.

Mermet de Cachon

Eugène-Emmanuel Mermet-Cachon (10 September 1828 – 14 March 1889), was a French priest and Roman Catholic missionary in Bakumatsu period Japan, who served as interpreter for and advisor to French diplomatic missions, playing crucial role in the development of a special relationship between the French government and the Tokugawa shogunate.
Biography.
Mermet-Cachon was born in La Pesse, in the Jura department in Franche-Comté in eastern France. He entered the seminary of the Paris Foreign Missions Society in July 1952 and was ordained on 11 June 1854. On 25 August 1854, less than two months after his ordination, he was sent to Hong Kong.
Together with Father Prudence Seraphin-Barthelemy Girard and Father Louis-Theodore Furet, he arrived at Naha, the capital of the Kingdom of Ryukyu on 6 May 1855. During his two years in Okinawa, he was unable to win a single convert; however, during this time he developed a working knowledge of the Japanese language. On his return to Hong Kong, he was recruited by Jean-Baptiste Louis Gros, whom he assisted at Edo with the negotiations cumulating in the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between France and Japan which was signed on 9 October 1858.
On November 1859 he returned to Japan, this time to Hakodate, the main town on the island of Hokkaido where he opened a French-language school of French in April 1860; however, he efforts to open a hospital were frustrated as Russian Orthodox missionaries had arrived first, and had received official blessing to establish a clinic. His efforts as a missionary also met with no success, and disappointed and humiliated, and suffering from ill health, he left Hakodate in 1863.
Mermet-Cachon returned to Edo and served as an interpreter for Prince Gustave Duchesne de Bellecourt, who was a strong advocate of the use of force to govern relations with Japan and who supported the French intervention in the 20 July 1863 Bombardment of Shimonoseki. After returning to France in July 1863, Mermet-Cachon abandoned the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and after renouncing his vows as a Catholic priest, returned to Japan in a private capacity as interpreter to the French diplomat Léon Roches in April 1864. On 1 April 1865, he established a French language school in Yokohama and took a former prostitute as his common-law wife. He returned to France again on 27 October 1866, apparently with the intention of making only a short stay; however, in 1867, he was requested to serve as an assistant to Tokugawa Akitake, the 14-year-old son of Tokugawa Nariaki, "daimyō" of Mito Domain, who had arrived as a special envoy of the Tokugawa shogunate for the 1867 World Fair in Paris, where Japan had a pavilion. He also acted as interpreter for Tokugawa Akitake's audience with Napoleon III, which subsequently resulted in strong French support for the Tokugawa shogunate. Mermet-Cachon never returned to Japan, but died in Cannes on 14 March 1889. His grave is at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris.

Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 3704

Iran Aseman Airlines Flight 3704 was a scheduled Iranian domestic passenger flight from Iranian capital Tehran Mehrabad International Airport to Yasuj in southwest Iran. On 18 February 2018, during its approach to Yasuj, the aircraft serving the flight, an ATR 72-212 operated by Iran Aseman Airlines, crashed into Mount Dena in the Zagros Mountains near Noqol village in Semirom county, Isfahan Province. All 60 passengers and 6 crew members on board were killed.
According to the interim report, which was published on 18 February 2019 by the Iranian Civil Aviation Organization (CAO), the accident was caused by multiple factors, with pilot error considered as the main cause. The investigation showed that the crew decided to continue to Yasuj despite deteriorating weather conditions in the area. During its approach, the crew elected to descend below the minimum altitude. The resulting bad weather caused the aircraft to stall. The crew failed to recover the aircraft from the stall and the aircraft crashed onto the mountain.
The crash highlighted the danger of mountain wave and the aviation industry's lack of awareness of the issue. The Iranian CAO published several recommendations to ICAO and the European Aviation Safety Agency to address the hazard that a mountain wave may pose to the safety of a flight. Subsequently, the crash also led to changes of the weather training programs for airliners in Iran.
Aircraft.
The aircraft involved was an ATR 72-212 with MSN 391. It was registered EP-ATS and was delivered to Iran Aseman Airlines in 1993. No serious incidents were recorded during the aircraft's 24 years of service in the airline.
An Iranian source reported that the aircraft had recently resumed operations after being out of service for seven years due to a lack of spare parts and that it had technical problems during a flight some weeks before the crash. It was claimed that an Instagram post from Iran Aseman two months prior to the crash, that announced the aircraft was back in service, had been deleted after it crashed.
At the time of the accident, Iran Aseman had six ATR aircraft in its fleet, three of which were in operation.
Passengers and crew.
It was initially reported that 59 passengers and six crew members were presumed to be on board. It was later revealed that there were 60 passengers and six crew members aboard. The flight manifest was consisted of 65 adults and 1 child. There were 60 passengers, 2 security guards, 2 flight attendants and 2 flight crew members.
The pilot of the flight was identified as 62-year old Hojatollah Foladi. He had accumulated a total flying hours of more than 17,000 hours, of which 12,000 hours were on the type. The pilot also had experience of flying in India from 2002 to 2007, before returning to Iran Aseman Airlines. At least 2 flights to Yasuj had been performed 3 months prior to the accident. His flying certificate was deemed as valid.
The pilot not flying was identified as 36-year old First Officer Khevah Khalili with a total flying hours of approximately 1,800 flying hours, including 197 hours on the type.
Accident.
The aircraft was operating a domestic scheduled passenger flight from Iranian capital Tehran Mehrabad International Airport to Yasuj Airport in Yasuj, the capital of Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province in southwest Iran. The flight was supposed to take about 50 minutes. It was operated by Iran Aseman Airlines, the third largest airline in Iran. It took off from Tehran with 60 passengers and 6 crew members on 18 February 2018 at about 04:35 UTC.
At 05:49 UTC, as Flight 3704 approached Yasuj, the flight crew asked the meteorological information in Yasuj. Yasuj Tower later informed Flight 3704 about the weather condition and mentioned that the final approach path was clear. The flight later was cleared to descent to FL170 by Tehran and was handed over to Yasuj on 05:53 UTC.
The crew stated that they would continue the approach with FL150. At 05:55, the crew reported that they were 25 miles from the destination airport. Yasuj Tower then told the pilot about the updated condition in Yasuj, stating that clouds were slowly moving to the south. Four minutes later, Yasuj asked the flight again and the crew responded that they failed to receive the signal of Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) from their navigational device. The crew then checked about the weather condition in the area again.
At 06:04 UTC, Yasuj Tower lost communication contact with Flight 3704. Attempts had been made to re-establish communication with the aircraft but failed.
According to flight tracking website Flightradar24, the last signal from the aircraft was received just before 05:56 UTC, descending from an altitude of .
Search.
Locals reported that they had heard the aircraft hit the mountain. Iranian authorities in neighboring Shiraz and Isfahan province had deployed two of their helicopters to the crash site. A total of 12 search and rescue teams had been dispatched to Mount Dena, but due to foggy conditions, rescue helicopters could not reach the crash site in the Zagros Mountains. Mount Dena, the location of the crash site, is actually a mountain range within the Zagros Mountains; it is long with several peaks, the highest of which is above sea level.
Spokesman from Iran Aseman Airlines initially stated that all 66 passengers and crews on board had been killed in the accident. However, this statement was later retracted by the airline and the airline later issued a statement saying that it could not "accurately and definitely confirm" that everyone had died in the crash.
In response to the crash, crisis centres were set up in Tehran, Isfahan, Fars and Yasuj. Weather conditions at the crash site, including snow and strong winds, were hampering search and rescue services. The Red Crescent Society announced that a drone would be flown to the area due to the severe weather condition which prevented helicopters to reach the crash site. Search and rescue team announced on 19 February that at least 5 helicopters had been prepared for the search operation. Troops with search dogs were deployed to hike the mountain and to search the area on foot. Search and rescue operation via air was stopped for the second time due to bad weather conditions. Reports that the wreckage had been found at an elevation of 11,482 feet were refuted by officials from the Iranian Red Crescent and Iranian investigators.
On 20 February, two helicopters from Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Air Force sighted the wreckage of the aircraft, below the peak of the mountains south of Noqol at an elevation of approximately . Another military helicopter sighted the wreckage and pinpointed the crash site. The aircraft was completely obliterated, with large portion of the tail cone, the vertical stabilizer, the rudder and the empennage were found. Scattered bodies could be seen around the wreckage. No survivors were seen at the crash site. All 60 passengers and 6 crew members on board died.
As helicopters were unable to land on the crash site, the recovery of the victims had to be done on foot. Officials stated that the bodies had to be carried on the rescuers' backs to the mountain foot. The head of the country's emergency services said that the recovery of the victims would be challenging due to the adverse weather. As of 21 February, at least 32 bodies had been recovered from the crash site.
On 3 March, Iranian officials announced they had found the flight recorders.
Investigation.
President of Iran Hassan Rouhani ordered Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Abbas Ahmad Akhoundi to lead the investigation. Iran Civil Aviation Organization (CAO) investigated the cause of the crash. The French BEA also sent 7 delegations to investigate the crash. The aircraft's manufacturer, ATR, sent 4 people to Iran to assist with the investigation.
Initial assessment didn’t find any abnormalities on the aircraft’s structure. Flight control failure and power system malfunctions were also not reported by the crew. The assessment did, however, reveal that the flight had entered cloud with icing condition prior to its landing. The flight crew tried to fly in an unallowable altitude to get out from the cloud and reached an unsafe altitude. As the aircraft was flying at the altitude, it encountered a series of updraft and downdraft, its airspeed decayed and it then entered a dangerous stall condition.
Weather.
Data on the weather condition in the area were collected from the Iranian Meteorological Agency and from the airport dispatcher. Data were also provided from interviews of numerous individuals including pilots who had flown from and to Yasuj. Additionally, the Iranian counterpart was also assisted by the French METEO-SAT.
METAR report retrieved by Iranian investigators showed that, during the dispatch of Flight 3704, the weather didn’t meet the minimum criteria for a flight to Yasuj. Yasuj Airport is listed in the airline’s operation manual as an airport with a minimum ceiling for an approach and landing at 11,000 ft. The ceiling at the time was broken (clouds cover at least 5/8 – 7/8 of the sky) with clouds reported at 9,000 ft. The report further stated that the condition in Yasuj would later deteriorate as cumulonimbus clouds were observed in the area, with thunderstorm, rain and hail would also occur. As the weather condition didn’t meet the criteria, the crews of Flight 3704 should have diverted the aircraft to Isfahan in the north or Shiraz in the south.
As the flight path included mountainous terrain in the route, Flight 3704 would counter a mountain wave phenomena in the area. A mountain wave is a form of a Lee wave that is resulted by a disturbance on the horizontal air flow. Mountain wave may poses threat to the safety of a flight as it can lead to severe turbulence, icing, strong windshear, and updraft and downdraft motion to the aircraft. The high elevation of the mountain at the flight path indicated that the mountain wave was a hazard for the safety of the flight. To counter the phenomenon safely, the flight crews should’ve flown the aircraft at a minimum airspeed while monitoring the airspeed closely to prevent a stall condition.
Analysis on Flight 3704’s FDR confirmed that the aircraft indeed had encountered mountain wave. The data revealed that the flight encountered an updraft and a downdraft motion created by the phenomenon.
Further analysis by Iran Meteorological Report stated that an unstable layer, turbulence and freezing level at an altitude of 11,000 ft were predicted. French Meteorological Agency stated that the weather condition in the area of the accident at the time was favorable for severe icing condition. However, even though severe icing condition was present at the time, the Aircraft Performance Monitoring (APM) simulation of the flight conducted by investigators suggested that the aircraft’s decrease of performance was more likely caused by external gradient such as wind. The mountain wave in the area caused a vertical wind with speed as high as 3,000 ft/min. The simulation revealed that as the aircraft flew over the mountain, a downdraft struck the aircraft and the nose pitch increased to maintain the flight altitude.
As it entered a stall condition, the crew then made a nose down pitch to counter it. The EGPWS was later activated until the end of the flight.
Crew performance.
The assessment of both pilots' behavior prior to their flights didn’t indicate any abnormalities. Investigators, however, did find that the crews had never been trained on how to execute an appropriate response when a mountain wave struck the aircraft. The crew was not familiar with mountain wave and the manual also didn’t provide information regarding the phenomenon. The ATR simulation also did not provide the crews with simulation on handling a mountain wave.
Prior to its approach to Mount Dena, the First Officer of Flight 3704 had made several recommendations to the Captain on several instances. The Captain didn’t respond at any of the given recommendations and decided to ignore it. The lack of communication between the Captain and the First Officer indicated a steep authority gradient phenomenon in aviation, which may be caused due to difference in flying experience.
It was evident that the crew of Flight 3704 had deviated from its operating manual. During Flight 3704’s approach to Mount Dena, the ATC had given clearance for the flight to fly at FL170. ATC later informed the crew that the ceiling was at 15,000 ft. The CVR recording revealed that the crew decided to descent further to an elevation of 15,000 ft so that the aircraft would get out of clouds. The minimum altitude for the airport however was 15,500 ft, so the crew was going to fly under the approved minimum altitude.
During its descent, the aircraft encountered an updraft and later a downdraft. The downdraft was strong enough to cause the nose pitch to rise. As the pitch was increased by the force of the downdraft, the airspeed decreased and the drag force increased accordingly, risking a stall condition to occur. As the power lever was increased to counter the low speed of the aircraft, the pitch kept increasing and the airspeed kept decreasing, at one point reaching 118 knots. The nose pitch reached +15 degree. While the crew tried to counter the stall condition by bringing the nose down, the crew didn’t execute the recovery properly. The engine was not in full power and the flaps were not set to 15 degree. It was presumed that the crew didn’t expect to encounter a mountain wave phenomenon in the area and thus this might have decreased their situational awareness. As the pilots tried to save the aircraft by bringing the nose down, there was no more altitude left for a safe recovery.
Conclusion.
The Iranian Civil Aviation Organization published the interim report, with the following: 
The investigation also noted that, while mountain wave phenomenon rarely cause an aircraft to crash, the phenomenon is rarely, if not ever, addressed to pilots. Many pilots are unaware of the phenomenon and flight manuals did not educate pilots enough on the matter.
The Iranian CAO issued 28 recommendations in response to the crash. Among the recommendations were:
The final report, published in 2020, had the same findings, albeit with minor rewording. The final report also had comments from the BEA.

On 23 February 2018, the Iran Civil Aviation Organization temporarily suspended the operation of Iran Aseman Airlines' ATR 72 aircraft.
The search and rescue operation was viewed as "too long" by some family members, some were angered due to the incompetent handling of the disaster. On 19 February, more than 100 people reportedly protested outside a government building in Dena Kooh, demanding Iranian officials to step down due to the response on the disaster.
Journalists have speculated that the economic sanctions against Iran which have prevented Iranian airlines from obtaining new planes and spare parts and forced them to operate aging aircraft may have contributed to the cause of the crash. Iranian judicial authorities and the special committee of the Islamic Consultative Assembly believed that the flight should not have been allowed in the first place, and blamed the Iran Aseman Airlines for the accident. Iranian Parliament investigation report on the incident, released on May 18, 2020, blamed Iranian Civil Aviation Organization and Aseman Airlines on the incident. The parliament report also accuses the manufacturer of the aircraft for not providing spare parts for the maintenance of the aircraft.

Gabriel de L'Aubespine

Gabriel de L'Aubespine (26 January 1579 - 15 August 1630) was a French prelate of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Bishop of Orléans from 1604 to 1630, he was made a knight in the Order of the Holy Spirit during the reign of Louis XIII on 31 December 1619. A learned man, he authored the liturgical work "Veteribus Ecclesia Ritibus", printed in Paris, in 1623.
Biography.
Originating from a family from Beauce, merchants and notables of Orleans, known since the middle of the fifteenth century, Gabriel de L'Aubespine was born 26 January 1579, son of , Baron of Chateauneuf, and Marie de La Chatre; he was the brother of Charles de L'Aubespine, future Keeper of the Seals. He began his studies in Paris where he obtained his bachelorate of theology in 1604 and became "socius" of the Sorbonne. He was a learned man, respected by his contemporaries for his knowledge of the writings of the Fathers of the Church; Nominal subdeacon of Orleans, he was succeeded by his brother, Guillaume, around 1600. He succeeds his brother and was named bishop in 1604, confirmed by the Holy See on 28 March 1604. He died in 1630.
The Duke of Saint-Simon, his grand-nephew by his mother Charlotte de L'Aubespine, drew his portrait in his "Memoirs". His impartiality may have suffered.
"The bishop of Orleans, Gabriel de L'Aubespine, elder brother of M. de Chateauneuf who was Keeper of the Seals to the disgrace of the Keeper of the Seals of Marillac, at the end of 1630, which was the famous day of the Dupes. One saw his family among those of the Chancellors and Guards of the Seals of France of Louis XIV, who returned them to him, in his minority, for a short time. Our prelate was bishop of Orleans in 1604 and crowned in Rome, March 28 of the same year, by the hand of Pope Clement VIII. He held one of the first places of the clergy of France by his doctrine and his ability in business, and illustrated it by his piety and his assiduity to his episcopal foundings. He was the soul of the assemblies of the clergy and all matters of doctrine in the Sorbonne and among the bishops. Between several works he has made, his treatise on the Eucharist has made his reputation immortal. He died in Grenoble, a little advanced in age, but consumed with study and work, 15 October 1630, deputy with other prelates of the assembly of the clergy towards the King, who was at Lyons."&lt;br&gt;— Saint-Simon

Alan Hywel Jones

Alan Hywel Jones, usually Hywel Jones professionally, is a British materials scientist, working on ceramic composites and body armour, tribology, metals, including sustainable use of precious metals and rare-earth elements, and decorative alloys, wear-resistant coatings, materials analysis and ballistics, and friction-stir methods (welding and processing). He has appeared on radio and television to discuss some of his areas of interest.
Early life.
Jones was born in Wales in 1970, and attended school in Ebbw Vale, about north of Cardiff.
Education and career.
Academic career.
Jones studied at the University of Warwick from 1988 to 1997, receiving a BSc in Physics (1991), an MSc in Materials Characterisation (1993), and a PhD titled "Synthesis and Tribology of Sialon / TiB2 Ceramic Composite" (1997). He then secured a post as a post-doctoral research fellow and worked over three years on an EU-funded project on ultra-hard composites for tribological applications.
Jones moved to a post at Sheffield Hallam University's Materials and Engineering Research Institute (MERI) in 2000, and continues to work there. He became a senior consultant in 2004, then a senior research fellow, and is now a principal research fellow. He coordinates the consultancy activities of the institute, and has been involved in several hundred projects.
Jones worked from 2008 to 2012 on UK Ministry of Defence-funded research into novel light-weight ceramic composite materials for personal armour, which in turn extended into armour-piercing ammunition, as well as kiln surfaces and high-wear industrial fittings.
His roles have also included membership in the Education and Skills Working Group of Materials UK, which produced a report on a 20-year strategy for UK materials science, the "What's in my stuff" public outreach and education campaign around recycling, and work as an expert witness in civil and criminal cases.
Recognition.
Jones was a joint recipient of the Venture Prize of the Worshipful Company of Armourers and Brasiers, one of the ancient livery companies of London, for work on lightweight ceramic body armour, an award linked to the launch of university spin-off venture XeraCarb. 
He was also a recipient of a Yorkshire Forward Award.
Collaborations.
Jones has worked closely with several fellow scientists and academics, including Anthony Pick, Karen Vernon-Parry, Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill and Maria Hanson.
Consultancy and commercialisation.
In 2011, Jones co-founded a university spinoff company, XeraCarb Ltd., with Anthony Pick. With headquarters and factory in Barnsley, the company works on silicon carbide composite ceramics, suitable for body armour and kiln linings, among other applications. Following acquisition, the company has since February 2017 operated as part of Capital Refractories, within the CRL Group, with Jones retained as Chief Scientific Officer.
In 2016, Jones co-founded, with Cóilín Ó Dubhghaill and others, Mikana Innovations Ltd., a spin-off based on joint work between Sheffield Hallam University and Rotary Engineering Ltd.; he is today a director. This company produces a hybrid alloy, mikana, based on Japanese craft techniques, suitable for volume production for the making of jewellery and other luxury items, and hollowware.
Advanced materials.
Jones has worked on a form of "stainless silver" alloy as well as advanced ceramics and the hybrid alloy mikana. The ceramics work has led to material advances in the making of personal armour and kiln lining, while mikana has properties similar to mokume gane while being more manageable and affordable.
Personal life.
Jones lives in the Sheffield suburb of Crookes.

<doc id="56619590" url="?curid=56619590" title="Fatty acid photodecarboxylase">
Fatty acid photodecarboxylase

Fatty acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) is an enzyme that converts exogenous fatty acids to alkanes or alkenes by the separation of carbon dioxide from the carboxylic group. The photoenzyme "Cv"FAP has been found in the chloroplast membrane of microalgae "Chlorella variabilis NC64A" and "Chlamydomonas reinhardtii 137C"; other FAP examples include flavin‐dependent DNA‐repair enzymes and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases.
Structure.
The crystallized structure of FAP shows a hydrophobic tunnel consisting of three domains. The inner FAP binding site is flanked by the domain loops that protect it from interacting with solvent. The C-terminal regulates interactions with other proteins and the N-terminal residues on the helical end stabilizes the neighboring tricyclic ring FAD cofactor.
Function.
Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is found to be responsible for capturing light photons that drive the reaction, with the overall FAP efficiency being dependent on both its enzyme concentration and the light intensity. Experimental studies show photon excited FAD react most favorably under continuous blue light (400-520nm) which produce carbon dioxide from the hydrolysis of fatty acid chains.
FAP’s catalytic activity is proportional to the length of the fatty acid chain due to the number of hydrophobic chains present in the hydrophobic tunnel that stabilize substrates. FAP preference to long-chain fatty acid produces higher turnover rate for hydrocarbons, which can then, in principle, be produced as biofuel as a favored alternative.

The Prümerburg is a ruined hill castle on a roughly 30-metre-high lias-sandstone rock on the upper edge of the valley of the Prüm in the municipality of Prümzurlay in the county of Bitburg-Prüm in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
History.
The Prümerburg, a fief of the counts and dukes of Luxembourg, is first recorded in 1337, but was probably built in the 12th century. In the immediate vicinity there was an earlier prehistorical hillfort ("Wallburgen"). The castle's features include the remains of a pentagonal "bergfried". The Prümerburg is believed to have burned down in 1658.
In 1337, Walter of Meysenburg is the first recorded vassal. In 1351, Godfrey of Meysenburg and his wife, Catharina of Homburg, were the enfeofees, later Prümzurlay, like Clerf, went to the lords of Brandenburg (a side line of the counts of Vianden). Subsequently there is evidence that the von Vinstingen and von Haracourt families (both by marriage) were vassals. A line of the von der Heyden family bought the Lordship of Prümerburg in the Early Modern Period, along with Niederweis and Stolzemburg.
To the northwest in the valley, the castle chapel, the Late Gothic former Chapel of St. Nicholas, has survived.

General Thomas James

Thomas James (1782–1847) was a trapper and hunter who took part in the expedition with the Missouri Fur Company that was contracted by Meriwether Lewis to safeguard the Mandan Chief Shehaka back to his tribe up the Missouri River. During the expedition he traded with Indians and hunted Beaver in the Rocky Mountains. James was also enlisted with the Illinois militia and held command over the spy battalion during the Black Hawk War. 
Early life and career.
Thomas James was of Welsh descent, born in Maryland in 1782. His father was Joseph Austin James and his mother was Elizabeth Hosten. In 1803, the family went in search of a new home in the West, living in various locations at Kentucky, and Illinois, until reaching Missouri in 1807 near Florissant. 
During this time, Lewis and Clark returned from their expedition, bringing with them the Mandan Indian Chief Shehaka from the Upper Missouri to visit the "Great Father" at Washington City. When Lewis was appointed Governor of Missouri Territory, he sent Chief Shehaka up the Missouri with an escort of about 40 United States troops under the command of Captain Prior. On their arrival to the country of Rickarees, a warlike Indian tribe attacked the Mandans and killed eight or ten soldiers while the rest retreated with Shehaka to St. Louis. With the formation of the Missouri Fur Company, an expedition was proposed to head up the Missouri and into the Rocky Mountains during Spring of 1809. Governor Lewis contracted with the company to convey the Mandan Chief back to his tribe for the sum of $10,000. Thomas James enlisted in this expedition and the money was raised for trading with the Indians and trapping Beaver along the headwaters of the Missouri and Columbia rivers. The total party consisted of 350 men. 
After the expedition, he started a career in milling. He purchased Kinney's Mill near the village of New Design in Monroe County, Illinois. This location was known for a time as "James' Mill." and later became known as Monroe City, Illinois. 
In 1825, he was elected as a general in the Illinois militia, becoming also a member of the Illinois legislature, where he served between 1826 and 1828. In 1827 he was also appointed postmaster at the town of James' Mills and kept the position for many years.
Black Hawk War.
James served as a major in the Black Hawk War, having a "spy battalion" under his command that was composed of three companies. They were led by Captain Daniel Price, Peter Warren, and Thomas Harrison. 
Albert Sidney Johnson signed orders designating Thomas James as a colonel during the war. 
Death.
At the close of the war, James returned to his former employments and died at Monroe City in December 1847.
Works.
A year before his death, he published the work "Three Years Among the Indians and Mexicans" as a memoir of expeditions as a hunter and trapper, wherein he details the a literary illustration of the character and customs of the Indians and Mexicans, accounting too of the battles he found himself in.

Sepia bertheloti

Sepia bertheloti, the African cuttlefish, is a species of cuttlefish from the family Sepiidae which is found in the warmer waters of the eastern Atlantic Ocean off Africa.
Description.
"Sepia bertheloti" grows to a mantle length of 175mm in males and 134mm in females. The dorsal anterior mantle margin forms a triangular lobe between the eyes. The wide fines have a wide gap between them at the rear. The males have a hectocotylus on the left ventral arm and this has one or two rows of normal size
suckers at the base, nine to thirteen rows of highly shrunken suckers in the middle part of the arm; these suckers are arranged in two dorsal and two ventral series which are laterally displaced and are separated by a gap. The suckers on the hectocotylus are covered by a well developed dorsal protective membrane. The tentacular club is straight and slender having five or six suckers in transverse rows in which a number of the suckers of the inner two or three rows are larger than rest. The cuttlebone is oblong in shape, outline roughly rectangular; tapering to a point anteriorly and rounded and blunt posteriorly. Its dorsal surface is evenly convex and covered with a sculpture of calcareous granulose arranged in a net like pattern which have their greatest concentration in the middle of the bone and at the long edges where they are arranged in irregular ridges parallel to the margin. The bone is most calcified at the rear and there is an indistinct dorsal median rib which broadens slightly towards the head end. The lateral and anterior margins of the cuttlebone are covered in chitin. On the dorsal part of the mantle there are a series of elongate papillae on either flank, situated around halfway along the base of the fins. It is purplish brown in colour with a zebra-like striping on the arms and an orange-red pigmented stripe which runs along their outer surface. The dorsal mantle has small spots, mainly towards the rear, and narrow, cream-coloured, broken lines running across it. The fins are pale and in the males there is a thin, shiny orange-pink stripe along the fin base of males which is bordered by a purplish band and one or two rows of many short bars which run along it.
Distribution.
"Sepia bertheloti" occurs along the western coast of Africa from Western Sahara south to Angola, it is also found off the Canary Islands.
Habitat and ecology.
"Sepia bertheloti" is found at depths of between 20m and 156m, being most numerous off the Canary Islands from depths of 70m-140m. At the Endeavour Bank they migrate to shallower waters on order to spawn in the summer and autumn. Their size distribution, as measured from animals caught by fisheries, shows a wider variation than for the sympatric "Sepia officinalis" during the summer. This wider variation suggests that either the spawning season is extended or at least some spawning happens continuously.
Fisheries.
"Sepia bertheloti" is fished for by trawling off the Canary Islands and is commonly captured off the western Endeavour Bank. Catches are often mixed with "Sepia hierredda" and separate data is difficult to get, although data from Spanish trawlers off Western Sahara indicate that this species makes up 11% of the cuttlefish catch and the remaining 89% is "S. hieradda". There are also fisheries for this species in Mauritania and Senegal.
Naming.
The specific name honours the French malacologist Sabin Berthelot (1794-1880) who was French consul at Tenerife. The type specimen was taken off Tenerife and is held in the Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle.

Kapohanaupuni (Kapo-hana-au-puni, Kapohanaʻaupuni) was a Hawaiian noble lady, and the sister of Lady Kapohauola of the island of Maui.
Life.
Kapohanaupuni was born in ancient Hawaii, and her sister was called Kapohauola, but it is unclear who were their parents. According to one ancient chant, Kapohanaupuni was a Lady of Hilo, a place on the island of Hawaii, which means that her parents were likely from Hilo. However, another tradition says that she was a daughter of the High Chief Kahokuohua of Molokai and a sister-wife of Kaulahea I of Maui.
The children of Kapohanaupuni were two sons, who were named Kakae and Kakaʻalaneo, and who both became chiefs of Maui. Kapohanaupuni's sister married Kakae, and their son was Kahekili I the Great, who was thus both a grandson and nephew of Kapohanaupuni's. Through her son, Kapohanaupuni was an ancestress of later rulers of Maui.

One Dimension Group

The One Dimension Group ("Al Bu'd al Wahad") was a modern art group founded in Iraq, by Shakir Hassan Al Said in 1971 which attempted to combine medieval Sufi traditions with contemporary, abstract art. Although the One Dimension Group was founded in Iraq, its members originated from across Arab nations, and its influence was felt across the Arab art world.
Background.
One Dimension is one of a number of art groups that formed in 20th-century Iraq. During the first world war, a small group of European officers and artists settled in Iraq, exposing young artists to Western art traditions and techniques. While local artists and middle classes developed an appreciation for European art, the arts community searched for ways of synthesising indigenous art with international trends. In effect, these groups were seeking to forge an Arabic art aesthetic and to use art to help their nations reassert a sense of national identity.
Between the 1930s and the early 1970s, more than six different art groups were formed: "The Pioneers" formed in the 1930s; "The Avantgarde Group" formed in 1950; "The Baghdad Modern Art Group" formed in 1951; "The Impressionists" formed in 1953; "The Corners Group" founded in 1961; "The Innovationists" founded in 1963; "The New Vision" founded in 1968 and "One Dimension" founded in 1971. Some of these groups endured for decades, while others were short-lived and abandoned within a few years of their formation.
Each of these groups developed different ideas about how to combine heritage and modernity and developed a different vision for a national art aesthetic. Although there were tensions in the different visions of these groups, collectively, they actively searched for new national vision which would enable the country to develop internally, as well as take its place on a world stage.
Of these art groups, the Baghdad Modern Art Group and the One Dimension Group are the most frequently cited.
Brief history and philosophy.
The One Dimension Group was established formally in 1971 by the prominent Baghdadi artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said, when he published a manifesto for the group. Al Said had previously been a founding member of the Baghdad Group for Modern Art (Jama'at Baghdad lil-Fann al-Hadith) together with Jawad Saleem (1919-1961) and Jabra Ibrahim Jabra (1919-1994), but he along with several high profile artists, had withdrawn from that group when it lost its sense of direction, following the death of its founder, Jawad Saleem in 1961.
The One Dimension manifesto gives voice to the group's commitment to both heritage and modernity and sought to distance itself from the modern Arab artists which they perceived as following European artistic traditions. One Dimension's objectives are complex and sophisticated; it is philosophy, technique, style and a relationship between time and space, between the visual and the non-visual. The "one dimension" is an oblique reference to Sufism, which has been described as "the inner dimension of Islam." The objectives of the One Dimension Group were multi-dimensional and complex. At the most basic level, the group rejected two and three-two dimensional artwork in favour of a single "inner dimension". This approach was influenced by both the philosophy of Martin Heidegger and the traditions of Arabic calligraphy and associated Sufi movements. In practice, a single inner dimension was difficult to realise because most artworks are produced on two-dimensional surfaces. At a more profound level, one dimension refers to "eternity". Al Said explained:
Al Said actively searched for relationships between time and space; and for a visual language that would connect Iraq's deep art traditions with modern art methods and materials. The incorporation of callij (calligraphy) letters into modern artworks was an important aspect of this relationship. The letter became part of Al Said's transition from figurative art to abstract art. Arabic calligraphy was charged with intellectual and esoteric Sufi meaning, in that it was an explicit reference to a Medieval theology where letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.
Al Said, and members of the One Dimension group, searched for a new artistic identity, drawn from within their own culture and heritage and successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy and Arabic motifs, into contemporary, abstract compositions. At an individual level, these artists were carrying out their own dialogue with national identity and modern art, at a broader level they also worked towards an aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented a broader affiliation with an Arab identity. Al Said and his group successfully bridged the gap between modernity and heritage. In so doing, they "charted a new Arabo-Islamic art aesthetic, and thus initiated a possible alternative for art valuating for local and regional art other than those allowed through an exclusionary Western canon of art history."
In focusing on the Arabic letter as the central element of his work, al-Said soon was collaborating with Madiha Omar (who by then was living in the US) and Jamil Hamoudi, who both joined his group. The One Dimension Group was very significant to the so-called School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the Hurufiyya movement) which comprised groups of artists that had emerged independently across North Africa and the Middle East in the second half of the 20th century, with the common thread being that each group searched for ways to integrate tradition and modernity in a way that would contribute to a distinct national style.
Although each of these groups developed locally, and went by different labels at the local level, collectively, these groups and their practitioners would become known as the School of Calligraphy (or Hurufiyya movement). In Jordan, the movement emerged in the 1950s and was known as the "Al-hurufiyyah movement", while in Iraq, the movement was known as "Al Bu'd al Wahad" (or the One Dimension Group)", and in Iran, the Saqqa-Khaneh movement. In Sudan, artworks took on a slightly different form - since artists rejected Western art traditions and included both Islamic calligraphy and West African motifs. In Sudan, the movement was known as the "Old Khartoum School." 
Original members of the One Dimension group include: Rafa al-Nasiri, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Nuri al-Rawi, Dia Azzawi, Jamil Hamoudi, Hashem Samarchi (b. 1939), Hashim al-Baghdadi (1917-1973) and Saad Shaker (1935-2005).

2011 African Nations Championship Final

The 2011 African Nations Championship Final was a football match to determine the champions of the CHAN 2011 tournament and took place on the 25th of February 2011
the match was contested by Tunisia and Angola. Tunisia defeated
Angola by 3–0, Tunisia winning their first title.
Before this match the two teams met in the group stages and it finished 1-1.
Background.
Angola defeated hosts and Sudan on penalties after a stormy 1-1 draw and secured a place in the final against Tunisia.
Tunisia also needed a shootout after a 1-1 deadlock following extra time before eliminating neighbours Algeria and reaching final. Angola won 4-2 on penalties and Tunisia 5-3 to set up a repeat of a Group D clash in Port Sudan which was drawn when the southern Africa nation scored deep in stoppage time.
Match.
Summary.
Angola started off well piling feverish pressure on the Carthage Eagles through the right flank but lacked a lot of polish with their finishing. Both teams raised the adrenalin levels of their fans with Tunisia coming close to scoring in the 13th minutes but the Palancas Negras’ man between the woodworks Lama made a point blank save.
Three minutes after, Zouhaier came close to scoring but the Angolan goalkeeper anticipated well to block it from his post.
Traoui Mejdi’s powerful drive in the 20th minutes was punched aside by Lama who was well positioned to deny the Eagles their first goal. Chedli Adel sent the Carthage fans on their foot at the Merreikh Stadium in the 37th minutes but he missed the post by an inch. Their one-two-one-two upfront kept mesmerizing the Angolan guardsmen but their finishing were poorly executed.
The dingdong battle continued into the interval.
The north Africans returned from the interval much determined. They set the stadium alive two minutes into the second half when Traoui Mejdi tapped in the ball from waist level with a perfect right foot from a Zouhaier cross from the left flank.
Tunisia’s onslaughts began paying off from the 74th minute when Zouhaier doubled their lead with a fine left foot roll of the ball that went past Lama straight into the woodwork.
As the game wears on substitute Darragi Ousama of Esperance put the final nail on the coffin in the 80th minutes to gift the north Africans the ultimate.

Carcinogenic parasite

Carcinogenic parasites are parasitic organisms that depend on other organisms (called hosts) for their survival, and cause cancer in such hosts. Three species of flukes (trematodes) are medically-proven carcinogenic parasites, namely the urinary blood fluke ("Schistosoma haematobium"), the Southeast Asian liver fluke ("Opisthorchis viverrini") and the Chinese liver fluke ("Clonorchis sinensis"). "S. haematobium" is prevalent in Africa and the Middle East, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). "O. viverrini" and "C. sinensis" are both found in eastern and southeastern Asia, and are responsible for cholangiocarcinoma (cancer of the bile ducts). The International Agency for Research on Cancer declared them in 2009 as a Group 1 biological carcinogens in humans.
Other parasites are also linked to various cancers. Among protozoan parasites, "Toxoplasma gondii", "Cryptosporidium parvum", "Trichomonas vaginalis" and "Theileria" are associated with specific cancer cells. "Plasmodium falciparum" can also be an indirect cause of cancer. Tapeworms such as "Echinococcus granulosus" and "Taenia solium" may directly or indirectly cause cancer. Liver flukes such as "Opisthorchis viverrini" and "Platynosomum fastosum" can cause cancer in domesticated animals. Roundworms such as "Strongyloides stercoralis", "Heterakis gallinarum", and "Trichuris muris" are known to cause cancer in animals.
History.
A rat roundworm "Gongylonema neoplasticum" was the first parasite discovered—allegedly—to cause cancer. A Danish physician Johannes Fibiger discovered it in 1907, and experimentally showed that he could induce stomach cancer in rats using the roundworm infection in 1913. In 1914, he gave the name "Spiroptera" ("Gongylonema") "neoplastica", but later changed it to "Spiroptera carcinoma". Fibiger won the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine "for his discovery of the Spiroptera carcinoma". However, his interpretation was later found to be false, and that the roundworm was not carcinogenic on its own. Fibiger's Nobel Prize was described as "one of the biggest blunders made by the Karolinska Institute."
The first true carcinogenic parasite discovered was "Schistosoma haematobium". Theodor Maximillian Bilharz, a German physician at the Kasr el-Aini Hospital in Cairo recovered the adult fluke from a dead soldier in 1851. He named it "Distomum haematobium". The disease is often called bilharzia in honour of the discoverer. The infectivity and life cycle was discovered by Scottish physician Robert Thomson Leiper in 1915. A British Surgeon Reginald Harrison, at the Liverpool Royal Infirmary, was the first to note its role in cancer. In 1889, he found that four people out of five cancer victims had bilharzia. A German physician Carl Goebel confirmed in 1903 that bladder tumour occurred in most bilharzia patients. By 1905, he was convinced that carcinoma of bladder was due to bilharzia.
Group 1 carcinogens in human.
Three flukes, urinary blood fluke ("Schistosoma haematobium"), Southeast Asian liver fluke ("Opisthorchis viverrini") and Chinese liver fluke ("Clonorchis sinensis") are classified as Group 1 carcinogens, i.e. they are substantiated and directly cancer-causing agents.
"Schistosoma haematobium".
"S. haematobium" is a digenetic trematode found in Africa and the Middle East. It is the major agent of schistosomiasis, the most prevalent parasitic infection in humans. It is the only blood fluke that infects the urinary tract, causing urinary schistosomiasis, and is the leading cause of bladder cancer (only next to tobacco smoking). Its life cycle is transmission between humans and freshwater snail, species of "Bulinus". The larvae live in water bodies from where they infect the hosts by penetrating the skin. Adults are found in the venous plexuses around the urinary bladder and the released eggs travels to the wall of the urine bladder causing haematuria and fibrosis of the bladder. The bladder becomes calcified, and there is increased pressure on ureters and kidneys (hydronephrosis). Inflammation of the genitals due to "S. haematobium" may contribute to the propagation of HIV. Antigens produced by the eggs induce granuloma formation. Granulomata in turn coalesce to form tubercles, nodules or masses that often ulcerate. This creates the pathological lesions found in the bladder wall, ureter and renal; and also tumour, both benign and malignant.
"Opisthorchis viverrini".
"O. viverrini" is a food-borne liver fluke that mainly attacks the area of the bile duct. Infection with the parasite, called opisthorchiasis is the major cause of cholangiocarcinoma, a cancer of the bile ducts, in northern Thailand, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, Vietnam and Cambodia.
"O. viverrini" has three successive host for its life cycle – the first intermediate hosts are freshwater snails of the genus "Bithynia", the second intermediate hosts are different cyprinid fish, and humans are the definitive hosts. Generally opisthorchiasis due to "O. viverrini" is harmless without any clinical symptoms, but in rare cases, cholangitis, cholecystitis, and cholangiocarcinoma can develop. "O. viverrini" invades the bile ducts and, rarely, the gall bladder and pancreatic duct. Heavy infection can produce problems such as fibrosis in the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts. Pathological effects on the bile ducts including inflammation, epithelial desquamation, goblet cell metaplasia, epithelial and adenomatous hyperplasia and periductal fibrosis collectively promote cholangiocarcinoma. Though it is not immediately life-threatening, cancer develops after 30–40 years, and the ensuing death is rapid—within 3–6 months of diagnosis.
"Clonorchis sinensis".
"C. sinensis" is also a food-borne liver fluke. It is the most prevalent human trematode in Asia, and is found in Korea, China, Vietnam and also Russia. 85% of the cases are found in China. It is transmitted similarly to "O. viverrini", but the species of snails are varied, of which "Parafossarulus manchouricus" is the most common. The cyprinid fish hosts are also different. General clonorchiasis is indicated with fatigue, abdominal discomfort, anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea, liver cirrhosis and jaundice. The most severe infections cause cholangiocarcinoma and hepatic carcinoma.
Indirect or putative carcinogens.
Infection with malarial parasite "Plasmodium falciparum" is classified by IARC as probable (Group 2A) carcinogen. "Schistosoma japonicum" is a possible (Group 2B) carcinogen. There is a close association between the cat liver fluke "Opisthorchis felineus" and bile duct cancer among people in Russia.
"Toxoplasma gondii" and eye cancer (intraocular lymphoma) was detected by PCR from two human cases. "Strongyloides stercoralis" eggs and adult worms may be linked with gastric adenocarcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma in Korea. "Cryptosporidium parvum" infection is associated with colorectal carcinoma.
Carcinogens in animals.
The roundworm "Trichuris muris" infection can increase the number of tumours in mice. Heavy infection with the trematode "Platynosomum fastosum" is associated with cholangiocarcinoma in cats. "Cryptosporidium parvum" infection can be the cause of carcinoma in the gut of mice.

List of sheriffs of Monmouth County, New Jersey

Monmouth County, New Jersey has had sheriffs since colonial era, when it was part of East Jersey and later was the Province of New Jersey.
After the Dutch surrender of New Netherland, Colonel Richard Nicolls, an English military officer, was authorized to establish the Monmouth Tract, which he did on April 8, 1665, and instituted a legal system centered on English common law During a brief period of control by the Dutch in 1673, a sheriff would be known as a schout.
"An Act to Appoint Sheriffs", was approved by the Legislature of East New Jersey on March 1, 1682. Terms were for a single year with a maximum of three consecutive terms.
Pursuant to Article VII Section II of the 1947 New Jersey State Constitution, each county in New Jersey is required to have three elected administrative officials known as "constitutional officers": the County Clerk, the County Surrogate (both elected for a five-year term) and the County Sheriff (elected for a three-year term). There are no term limits.
Shaun Golden has been the 76th Sheriff of Monmouth County since 2010.

2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final

The 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final was the 131st final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship and the culmination of the 2018 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship in Gaelic football. The match was played at Croke Park in Dublin on 2 September 2018.
It was the second time the teams had met in the final; Dublin won the first encounter in 1995. It was the third consecutive year that a team qualified under the system of second chances introduced in 2001; Tyrone qualified despite defeat in its provincial championship.
Dublin won the final by a margin of six points, on a scoreline of 2–17 to 1–14. The victory was Dublin's fourth consecutive All-Ireland title, making them the third county to win "four-in-a-row" (the others are Wexford in 1915–18 and Kerry in 1929–32 and 1978–81).
The game was televised nationally on RTÉ Two as part of "The Sunday Game" live programme, presented by Michael Lyster from Croke Park, with studio analysis from Joe Brolly, Pat Spillane, and Colm O'Rourke. Match commentary was provided by Ger Canning with analysis by Dessie Dolan. This was the last occasion on which Michael Lyster presented RTÉ's television coverage, having decided to retire from "The Sunday Game" at the end of 2018. The game was also televised internationally by Sky Sports, presented by Rachel Wyse and Brian Carney.
Paths to the final.

"Dublin won the Leinster Championship and so advanced directly to the quarter-final group stage."
All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s).
"Dublin finished first in Group 2 and advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final, to play the team who placed second in Group 1 - Galway."

"Having been beaten by Monaghan, Tyrone were eliminated from the Ulster championship and entered Round 1 of the All-Ireland qualifiers."
All-Ireland Quarter-Final Group Stage (Super 8s).
"Tyrone finished second in Group 2, behind Dublin, and advanced to the All-Ireland semi-final, to play the winner of Group 2, Monaghan."
Pre-match.
The match had originally been scheduled for 26 August, but had to be moved to accommodate the visit of Pope Francis to Ireland, where he attended the World Meeting of Families. The final had been moved from its traditional date of the third Sunday of September to allow more time for club matches.
Tyrone's RTÉ boycott.
On Monday 20 August 2018, just under two weeks before the final, the "Irish Independent" reported that RTÉ had confirmed that Tyrone would not be involved in any media coverage with the national broadcaster surrounding the event. The boycott, considered a tradition at this stage in relation to Tyrone, involved for the first time an All-Ireland final, after which RTÉ airs television coverage from the hotel in which the winning team is booked to stay. This meant that, in the event of a Tyrone win, RTÉ would be unable to cover the after-match events as per usual, including interviews on the pitch with players and the management team. Tyrone's All-Ireland final boycott was a continuation of a seven-year blacklisting of RTÉ by the county, the cause of which was a radio sketch aired in 2011 on RTÉ Radio 1. The sketch incensed Tyrone, as it was deemed to be mocking Michaela Harte (daughter of Tyrone manager Mickey Harte), shortly after she was murdered while on honeymoon in Mauritius.
Former All-Ireland winning captain Peter Canavan suggested the timing of RTÉ's announcement was intended to put pressure on Tyrone.
Minor final.
Kerry played Galway in the All-Ireland Minor Football Championship final which took place before the senior final. Kerry won the game on a 0–21 to 1–14 scoreline to complete a five in a row of All Ireland wins.

Officials.
On 20 August, Cork's Conor Lane was confirmed as the referee for the final. He was previously in charge of the drawn final between Dublin and Mayo in 2016.
Team news.
Tyrone made one change to the team from the semi-final win over Monaghan with Mark Bradley starting ahead of Lee Brennan. Despite fears of an injury to Cian O'Sullivan, Dublin named an unchanged side, with the same starting fifteen that overcame Galway three weeks earlier.
Summary.
Dublin began the game unchanged with Tyrone making 2 late changes - Rory Brennan and Conor Meyler replaced Frank Burns and Richie Donnelly. Prior to the game, Dublin, as reigning All-Ireland champions for three consecutive years, were heavy favourites to win. They took an early lead after Dean Rock scored a free, but he put his next two efforts wide, allowing Tyrone to assert dominance for fifteen minutes. During this timeframe, the Ulster team opened up a four-point lead, with the score poised at 0–05 to 0–01 in favour of Mickey Harte's side. However, the tide of the game turned once more in a dramatic, as Paul Mannion was fouled in Tyrone's penalty box, leading Conor Lane to award a penalty to Dublin, which Mannion calmly slotted home. Coupled with another successful free from Rock, this left the teams equal with five points apiece. Tyrone only managed to secure one more point in the remaining twenty-four minutes of the half, and their lack of clinicality in front of goal opened the door to a resurgent Dublin side. In the twenty-eighth minute, Dublin pulled further ahead courtesy of another goal. Con O'Callaghan took the ball deep into Tyrone territory before offloading to Niall Scully, who calmly fisted it into Niall Morgan's unguarded net. Thus, the teams headed in at half-time with Dublin seven points to the good, having racked up 2–07 to Tyrone's 0–06.
While Tyrone reduced the deficit by two early in the second half, with points from Connor McAliskey and Kieran McGeary narrowing Dublin's margin somewhat, the team in blue, affectionately known as "the Dubs", had accumulated an unassailable lead. The second thirty-five minutes were not entirely without incident, however; Dublin had pulled further out of sight, with points from Ciaran Kilkenny and Brian Fenton further diminishing whatever minuscule chances Tyrone had at mounting a comeback. However, in the sixty-sixth minute, Tyrone were given a late opportunity to draw near again, as Philly McMahon brought down Colm Cavanagh with a rash challenge, granting Tyrone a penalty - this was coolly dispatched by Peter Harte, breaching Stephen Cluxton's net for the first time in the game. Later, John Small was given a second yellow card, and ergo sent off, leaving Dublin to finish with just fourteen men. Ultimately, a point at the death from Kevin McManamon put the victory beyond any doubt. Conor Lane, the County Cork native, blew the final whistle, confirming Dublin's victory with a margin of six points. The final score was 2–17 to 1–14. The man of the match award was bestowed upon Jack McCaffrey, who received the award ahead of his other nominated teammates, Kilkenny and Mannion.
As captain, goalkeeper Stephen Cluxton, making his 200th appearance for the county, lifted the Sam Maguire Cup aloft from the Hogan Stand. The win represented Dublin's fourth consecutive win under the management of Jim Gavin, a feat only previously achieved by two other counties - Kerry and Wexford. It also further extended Dublin's unbeaten run in the Championship; the side was last beaten in 2014.
Trophy presentation.

Frank Cummings

Frank Mark Cummings (31 March 1891 – 11 November 1954) was a rower who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris.
War service.
Pre-war, Cummings was a storeman. He enlisted in the AIF aged 24 in August 1915. He joined the 32 Bttn. in their 3rd reinforcement and embarked from Adelaide on HMAT A28" Militiades" in February 1916. On the Western Front, he was promoted to Corporal and he served with the 32nd Bttn Cummings was wounded twice during World War I. In May 1917, surgeons had to remove bomb splinters from his back and legs after being sent on patrol to determine whether the Germans were withdrawing from the Hindenburg Line, then a year later he suffered severe burns after a mustard gas attack. He returned to Australia in December 1918. Later in life, his wounds would see him confined to a wheelchair
Club and state rowing.
Post-war Cummings was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and in 1920 he joined the Murray Bridge Rowing Club where his brother Robert was the coxswain of the club's senior men's eight. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They had won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and for the four years from 1920 to 1923, they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Frank Cummings secured the seven seat in the Murray Bridge eight of 1922 and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1922 and 1923.
International representative rowing.
In 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim for national Olympic selection could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Cummings and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working-class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew (including Cummings) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swiveling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Cummings in the seven seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.
Frank Cummings continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He was again seated at seven in the South Australian representative eight's King's Cup campaign of 1925 (fourth place).

Robert Campbell (Liberal politician)

Robert Campbell (12 July 1811 – 1887) was a British Liberal Party politician, originally from Australia.
He was born in Sydney, Australia, on 12 July 1811, the son of Scottish-born merchant. entrepreneur and pastoralist Robert Campbell (1789–1851). He married Anne Orr in Parramatta, New South Wales on 15 January 1835. They later moved to England.
In 1859 he bought Buscot Park where he lived until his death in 1887.
He was elected MP for Helston at a by-election in May 1866 but was unseated in July 1866. The by-election had originally recorded 153 votes for both him and his rival, William Brett, but Campbell was declared elected after the Returning officer (who was the father of his election agent) cast a vote for him, after consulting a legal textbook which suggested he could make the casting vote.
A petition was lodged, and a committee decided the returning officer had no right to cast the vote and should have declared both candidates elected. However, on scrutiny one vote was taken from Campbell's total, leaving Brett elected alone. This election led to Parliament deciding that "according to the law and usage of Parliament, it is the duty of the sheriff or other returning officer in England, in the case of an equal number of votes being polled for two or more candidates at an election, to return all such candidates".
In 1877, Campbell's daughter Edith married Herbert Reuter, of Reuters. Within a few days of her death in 1915, Reuter killed himself.
His daughter Florence married Charles Bravo and was suspected of his murder, dying in 1878 of alcohol poisoning. 
Campbell's son Robert Campbell (1843–1889) went into politics in New Zealand.

Clay panel

Clay panel or clay board (also known as "loam panel", "clay wallboard", "clay building board", "clay building panel") is a panel made of clay with some additives. The clay is mixed with sand, water, and fiber, typically wood fiber, and sometimes other additives like starch. Most often this means employing the use of high-cellulose waste fibres. To improve the breaking resistance clay boards are often embedded in a hessian skin on the backside or similar embeddings.
By introducing the clay panels, the building material loam can also be used in dry construction. Clay wallboards are a sustainable alternative to gypsum plasterboards, suitable for drywall applications for interior walls and ceilings. It can be applied to either timber or metal studwork. Usually the application of clay boards is completed with clay finishing plaster.
Constructional properties.
The boards have fire retardant properties and medium levels of acoustic insulation. Due to the clay component they have the ability to absorb large amounts of humidity through the plaster and helping to protect vulnerable buildings from excess moisture generated by modern living.
Production.
Clay panels are available from different manufacturers in different designs. The main component is clay or loam. This is either reinforced by a reed mat or stabilised by straw or wood fibres (sawdust) as with clay bricks. Further vegetable or mineral aggregates may also be contained. The boards are not heat-treated, so that the positive characteristics of the clay remain in its entirety.
Processing.
Clay panels are used for the dry construction of wall and ceiling claddings and facing shells. The boards are mounted on a steel profile or wooden frame construction by means of screws or nails. For ceiling claddings, washers must be used depending on the type of clay panel. The panels can be sawn with standard tools, like a cutter knife, a jigsaw or a circular saw. The joints of the clay boards often have tongue and groove for easier processing. The joints must be reinforced with a jute fabric or glass fibre fabric and filled with a fine clay plaster mortar. The clay board is mounted in vertical or horizontal form. The clay building wall or ceiling can then be treated with a clay plaster or painted directly with clay paint.
Combination with heating and cooling.
Clay is an ideal construction material for combinations with heating and cooling. Before the development of drywall panels made of clay, however, wall heating elements could only be laid in clay plaster. Meanwhile, some manufacturers offer clay building boards with integrated heating and cooling pipes. This makes the installation of heating and cooling in dry construction on walls and ceilings much easier.

Hurufiyya movement

The Hurufiyya movement ( "ḥurufiyyah", adjectival form "ḥurufī", literally "letters [of the alphabet]") is an aesthetic movement that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century amongst Arab artists, who used their understanding of traditional Islamic calligraphy within the precepts of modern art. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a culture specific visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the Hurufi, an approach of Sufism which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian Sandra Dagher has described Hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in Arabic art in the 20th century.
Definition.
The term, "hurifiyya" is derived from the Arabic term, "harf" which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe a contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos. Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning.
The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the "Al-hurufiyyah movement" or the "Letrism movement") refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work. The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the Letterist International which had an Algerian section founded in Chlef in 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou.
The term, "hurufiyya" has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including Wijdan Ali, Nada Shabout and Karen Dabrowska. An alternative term, "al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann" [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.
Brief history and philosophy.
Traditional calligraphic art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined it to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts. Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists, however, broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.
The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the "Old Khartoum School", and assumed a distinctive character, in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style. In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Amazigh motifs. In Jordan, it was generally known as the "al-hurufiyyah" movement, while in Iran, it was called the Saqqa-Khaneh movement.
Some scholars have suggested that Madiha Omar, who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949. However, other scholars have suggested that she was a "precursor" to Hurufiyya. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of Ibrahim el-Salahi, who initially explored Coptic manuscripts, a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy. It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, Jamil Hamoudi who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) () and Hossein Zenderoudi, who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale. 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.
The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art: 
The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, Mahmoud Taha, who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship, and sculptors, such as the Qatari, Yousef Ahmad and the Iraqi sculptors, Jawad Saleem and Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's "Al Bu'd al Wahad" (or the One Dimension Group)" which published a manifesto, while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.
Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. However, the "Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture," while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school."
Evolution of hurufiyya.
Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists:
Types of hurufiyya art.
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art. Ali identifies the following, which she describes as "schools" within the "movement":
Notable exponents.
Iraqi painter, Madiha Omar, is recognised as a pioneer of the hurufiyya art movement, having exhibited a number of hurufist-inspired works in Georgetown in Washington as early as 1949. and publishing "Arabic Calligraphy: An Inspiring Element in Abstract Art" in 1950. Jamil Hamoudi was also a pioneer, active from the 1950s. Both Omar and Hamoudi joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said in 1971 since its principles were based on the importance of the Arabic letter. The artist and art historian, Princess Wijdan Ali, who developed the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern, abstract format and is considered a pioneer of the movement in Jordan, has been able to bring hurufiyya to the attention of a broader audience through her writing and her work as a curator and patron of the arts.
Notable exponents of hurufiyya art include:
Algeria
Egypt
Iraq
Iran
Jordan
Lebanon
Morocco
Pakistan

Exhibitions.
Individual hurufiyya artists began to stage exhibitions from the 1960s. In addition to solo exhibitions, several group exhibitions showcasing the variations in hurufiyya art, both geographically and temporally, have also been mounted by prestigious art museums.

Minyangbal

The Minyungbal, also written Minjungbal, are an indigenous Australian people of New South Wales who speak the Minyungbal language.
Name.
Their ethnonym derives from their word for 'what'("minjung"), meaning literally 'people who say 'minjung' for the idea of 'what'.
Country.
According to Norman Tindale, the Minyungbal held some of territory running northwards from Cape Byron as far as Southport. Their inland extension ran to Murwillumbah and Nerang Creek.
Mythology.
The origin story of the Minyungal concerns the legend of three brothers, each of whom established one of the tribes of the area.
It tells of the arrival to this part of the eastern Australian coastline by 3 men/mythical culture heroes ("Berruġ, Mommóm" and "Yaburóng")and their wives and children in a canoe.
Long ago, Berruġ together with Mommóm (and) Yabúrong came to this land. They came with their wives and children in a great canoe, from an island across the sea. As they came near the shore, a woman on the land made a song that raised a storm which broke the canoe in pieces, but all the occupants, after battling with the waves, managed to swim ashore. This is how 'the men' the "paiġål" black race, came to this land.The pieces of the canoe are to be seen to this day. If any one will throw a stone and strike a piece of the canoe, a storm will arise, and the voices of Berrúġ and his boys will be heard calling to one another, amidst the roaring elements. The pieces of the canoe are certain rocks in the sea.
At Ballina, Berrúg looked around and said, "nyuġ?" and all the paiġål about there say nyuġ to the present day. On the Tweed he said, "ġando?" (ngahndu)and the Tweed paigål say "ġando" to the present day. This is how the blacks came to have different dialects. Berrúġ and his brothers came back to the Brunswick River, where he made a fire, and showed the paiġål how to make fire. He taught them their laws about the "kippåra", and about marriage and food. After a time, a quarrel arose, and the brothers fought and separated, Mommóm going south, Yaburóng west, and Berrúġ keeping along the coast. This is how the paiġål were separated into tribes.

Yusaku Obata

Yusaku Obata (小幡優作, Obata Yusaku, born February 13, 1984) is a Japanese professional wrestler, currently a freelancer. He's best known for his time in Pro Wrestling Zero1 (ZERO1), where is a former World Heavyweight Champion, a former two-time NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Champion, a former NWA United National Heavyweight Champion, the winner of the 2013 and 2016 Furinkazan and the 2016 Fire Festival.
He is also known for his work in Apache Pro Wrestling Army, where he was a former WEW Tag Team Champion alongside HIROKI. Obata was originally trained by Kaientai Dojo and left the promotion in 2006. After leaving K-Dojo, Obata had much better success after signing with ZERO1 in 2012.
Professional wrestling career.
Kaientai Dojo (2004–2006).
In 2004, Obata joined Kaientai Dojo as a trainee. He was scheduled to debut against Yasu Urano but was postponed due to a neck injury. On April 24, 2005, Obata made his in-ring debut losing to Hajime Ishikawa. Obata then took part of the 2005 K-Metal League, finishing with one win and five losses placing last. Obata was then drafted to the GET brand and would later take part of the 2006 Strongest-K Tournament at GET Block A losing all of his matches in his block. On September 3, he would join KAZMA’s Kinnoto unit after appealing to join. This would be short lived due to Obata leaving K-Dojo after his contract expired on November 12.
Apache Pro Wrestling Army and XMF (2006–2009).
Before signing with Apache Pro, Obata made sporadic appearances until he signed after leaving K-Dojo on December 16, 2006. During his time in Apache he would regularly compete in Big Japan Pro Wrestling. This led to Obata getting his first title opportunity as he teamed with Kintaro Kanemura to challenge Daisuke Sekimoto and Yoshihito Sasaki for the BJW Tag Team Championship on November 26, 2007 but they lost. He would also appear in New Japan Pro-Wrestling LOCK UP events. In 2008, Apache Pro closed and he then joined Kanemura's XMF promotion but that promotion was short lived and closed in 2009.
Pro Wrestling ZERO1 (2008–2019).
Before he joined Pro Wrestling ZERO1, he would make sporadic appearances until he signed with promotion in June 2012. On June 22, Obata made his official debut after signing losing to Kohei Sato. On August 5, Obata won his first title defeating Shito Ueda for the NWA United National Heavyweight Championship. After a two month reign, Obata lost the NWA United National Heavyweight Championship to James Raideen on October 16. On November 6, Obata and Ueda defeated Masato Tanaka and Zeus for the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship. Obata and Ueda took part in the 2012 Furinkazan tournament, losing to Zeus and James Raideen in the finals on December 15. Obata and Ueda vacated the titles on January 18, 2013 due to Obata being sidelined with an injury. In July, Obata took part in the 2013 Fire Festival tournament, where he finished with 3 points failing to advance to the finals. Obata and Ueda then took part of the 2013 Furinkazan tournament, defeating Raideen and Tama Williams in the finals on December 17.
After Obata and Ueda won the tournament, Ueda turned on Obata which led to a feud between the two. Subsequently, Obata formed an alliance with Masato Tanaka, Daichi Hashimoto and Ikuto Hidaka. The three later formed a stable named Dangan Yankees. On January 1, 2014 Obata and Tanaka received an opportunity for the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship losing to KAMIKAZE and Shinjiro Otani. The feud between Obata and Ueda didn't end as Ueda formed Daemon-gun with KAMIKAZE, Takuya Sugawara and Touru Owashi. The two faced each other twice on March 18 and on March 30 where the loser would be forced to change his name and would also lose his hair. Obata ended up losing both matches with Ueda forcing Obata to have his head shaved and to being renamed to Omatayuuchaku. On April 9, after Omatayuuchaku lost to his Dangan Yankees Masato Tanaka, he would get the rights to his name back. From July until August, Obata took part of the 2014 Fire Festival at block A. He would finish his block with four wins five losses, finishing at last after losing to another block A participant Daisuke Sekimoto. At the end of the year, Obata took part of the 2014 Furinkazan tournament with Akebono losing in the semifinals to Shinjiro Otani and Yoshikazu Yokoyama on December 24. In 2015, Obata received two shots for the NWA United National Heavyweight Championship. The first shot was on July 7 and the second on July 21 losing to the defending champion KAMIKAZE on both occasions. Obata then entered the 2015 Fire Festival, where he finished with a record of two wins, two losses and one draw, same as block semifinalist Masato Tanaka, but failed to advance to the finals due to the match against Tanaka ending in a time-limit draw in their head-to-head match. On September 23, Obata unsuccessfully challenged Kohei Sato for the ZERO1 World Heavyweight Championship.
On June 16, before the 2016 Fire Festival, Obata had to defeat Hideki Hosaka to earn a place in the tournament. In July, Obata took part of the Fire Festival, finishing the tournament with five wins, three losses and one draw, advancing to the finals. On July 31, Obata defeated Shinjiro Otani to win the Fire Festival. The winner of the tournament is presented with the "Fire Sword", which they carry for the following year until the next Festival. Obata received his shot for the World Heavyweight Championship on August 18 unsuccessfully challenging Kohei Sato again for the championship. Obata then took part in the 2016 Furinkazan, forming a team with KAI. The two would then defeat Akebono and Shogun Okamoto to win the tournament. Instead of the two receiving a shot for the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship Championship, Obata chose to receive another shot World Heavyweight Championship. Obata received his third shot for the World Heavyweight Championship unsuccessfully challenging Sato again for the third time. Obata and KAI would receive their shot for the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship on March 2 losing to Akebono and Okamoto in a rematch. After Akebono and Okamoto vacated the titles due to Akebono's being sidelined with health issues, Obata and KAI defeated Hideki Suzuki and Kohei Sato for vacant NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship on May 21.
Obata then started feuding with former Dangan Yankees stablemate Masato Tanaka after Tanaka turned on Obata and joined the Voodoo Murders on February 19. Obata then took part of the 2017 Fire Festival, finishing the tournament with five wins, two losses and two draws, advancing to the finals. In the finals, Obata faced Tanaka, where he ended up losing his Fire Sword to Tanaka. On August 30, Obata and KAI were stripped of the NWA Intercontinental Tag Team Championship due to Zero1 being unable to book a title defense for the two because of scheduling conflicts. In the fall, Yuko Miyamoto asked Obata to team up with him in the Furinkazan Tag Tournament in which Obata accepted. The two ended up losing at the finals to Shogun Okamoto and Yutaka Yoshie. On January 1, 2018 Obata ended his feud with Tanaka by defeating him for the World Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, he was challenged by Miyamoto in a double title match for his Bakuha-ō Championship and Obata's World Heavyweight Championship. The two faced each other on January 28 and the match ended in a double KO, thus Miyamoto and Obata retained their titles and Obata made his first successful defense. Obata next faced Isami Kodaka on February 12, but the match again ended in a draw, meaning Obata made his second successful defense. This changed on March 4, when he decisively defeated Kohei Sato to make his third successful defense. On April 22, he defeated Tanaka's Voodoo Murders stablemate Hartley Jackson to make his fourth successful defense. However on June 3, he lost the title back to Tanaka in his fifth defense by referee stoppage after he fell off the top rope and partially fractured and chipped a bone in his neck, which was later revealed as being caused by a heat stroke from dehydration and breathing problems. This also forced him to be removed from the 2018 Fire Festival that he was supposed to take part in the next month. On March 3, 2019, Obata announced his departure from Zero1.

Facial infiltrating lipomatosis

Facial infiltrating lipomatosis (FIL), also referred to as congenital infiltrating lipomatosis of the face or facial infused lipomatosis, is an ultra-rare craniofacial overgrowth condition caused by a genetic mutation of the PIK3CA gene. The condition is a part of the PIK3CA related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). The disease is congenital and non-hereditary. First described by Slavin and colleagues in 1983.
For this disease the mutation causes overgrowth of half of the face (hemifacial). It affects both soft and hard tissue (facial skeleton). The condition is noticeable at birth by the asymmetrical cheeks, with one cheek being prominently larger than the other.
Signs &amp; symptoms.
Congenital hemifacial enlargement in which mature lipocytes invade adjacent tissue. Phenotypic features include soft-tissue and skeletal hypertrophy and regional macrodontia. The manifestation are variable ranging from mild to severe. The overgrowth is typically present at birth. The most common features, all features on only one affected side of the face, are:
Not all patients with facial infiltrating lipomatosis have all these symptoms.
Cause.
Mutations in the PIK3CA gene have been identified as the cause for facial infiltrating lipomatosis. The mutation is "de novo" and mosaic meaning it's new, not inherited and not occurring in every cell. One of the DNA nucleotides was altered, causing a change in the amino acid put being into the protein, referred to as a missense mutation, and for PROS, this gives an overactivity, "gain-of-function". The gene is a part of PI3K-AKT/mTOR pathway, a pathway crucial to cell growth, survival, angiogenesis and proliferation.
Treatment.
There is no cure for FIL/PROS. Management usually consists of multiple debulking surgeries and/or drug treatment. Due to the infiltrating fat in important facial structures complete excision of the overgrowth is often impossible and there is a high risk of regrowth after resection.
The current drug treatment options are either a mTOR inhibitor, a pan AKT (AKT1-2-3) inhibitor or a PIK3CA inhibitor. The mTOR inhibitor is an off-label use, the use of the AKT-inhibitor is currently in a clinical trial (MOSAIC) and the PIK3CA inhibitor is only available through compassionate use program (if one is eligible).

John Wyllie (politician)

John William Shaw Wyllie, , (6 October 1835 – 15 March 1870) was a British Liberal Party politician and British Indian civil servant.
Early life.
Wyllie was the son of British Army officer Sir William Wyllie and Amelia (née Hutt), and was born while his father was on tour in Poona, under the Bombay presidency. He returned to Britain with his mother in 1841, and was then educated by a private tutor at Edinburgh Academy, and then, between 1849 and 1853, at Cheltenham College with his brother Frank.
Intended by his father to join the Indian Civil Service, Wyllie obtained a nomination by his uncle William Hutt to attend the University of Oxford, ultimately winning an open scholarship at Trinity College in 1854, and resigning another he had gained at Lincoln College in 1853. He graduated in 1855 with a first class in moderations, and then passed the examination for the Indian Civil Service.
On furlough from 1864 to 1865, he returned to Trinity College to sit his examinations, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in 1864, and a Master of Arts in 1868.
Indian civil service.
Wyllie followed in his father's footsteps, joining the Bombay Presidency, and a 'competition-wallah', moving to India in November 1856. He then became, in January 1858, a third assistant political agent in Kathiawar, before in June, nearly dying of Gujarat fever, which permanently impaired his health.
During this period, Wyllie translated Colonel Lang's "Mulk Sherista" into English and also served as an assistant commissioner in Barabanki district and Lucknow. He then became an assistant secretary to Sir George Yule in 1862, also acting as chief commissioner of the province, and in May 1862 became Calcutta Secretariat upon the recommendation of Sir Henry Marion Durand.
In 1866, he was made an under-secretary to the foreign department, becoming an exponent of foreign policy in an article, "The foreign policy of Lord Lawrence", which extolled the governor-general's policy. When published in the "Edinburgh Review" in January 1867, he influenced public opinion, bringing the phrase 'masterly inactivity' into the common lexicon.
In his final days in India, Wyllie arranged the grand durbar at Agra in November 1866.
Return to Britain.
A deterioration in health, caused by his earlier Gujarat fever, forced Wyllie to return home in 1867 and, upon persuasion by his uncle, Sir William Hutt, he gave up his Indian career to enter home politics.
He was elected MP for Hereford in 1868, standing on a platform of Irish disestablishment and secular education. During the election, he resigned from the Indian service, worrying he would be disqualified for holding an office of profit under the crown.
However, Wyllie was shortly after unseated in March 1869, after the Conservative rivals had alleged bribery and treating. Indeed, the election was declared void on petition, after the Liberal agent was found to have "given breakfast to Liberal electors", and therefore was guilty of treating.
Wyllie did no re-stand in the resulting by-election, lamenting that "he had foresaken the Indian service for a career that now sunk under him; he had burned his ships and could not return".
Later life and death.
Wyllie continued to write after his failed election, including "Masterly inactivity", published by "The Fortnightly Review" in December 1869, defending Lawrence's non-interventionist policy towards Afghanistan and opposing occupation of Quetta, Pakistan; and "Mischievous activity", published also "The Fortnightly Review" in March 1870, criticising Lord Mayo's more interventionist external policy.
Wyllie also contributed to the "Cornhill Magazine", the "Edinburgh Review", and the "Calcutta Review", and wrote letters for "The Times" and publications focused on central Asia.
On 2 June 1869, he was made a Companion of the Order of the Star of India (CSI) for Indian Services and, in January 1870, he moved to Paris to improve his French and study French politics. While there, he suffered from a cold, then inflammation of the lungs and recurred malarial fever, before dying aged 34 at the Hôtel Vouillemont on 15 March 1870. He was temporarily interred at Montmartre, before his remains were moved to Kensal Green Cemetery.

Daniel Miller (engineer)

Daniel Miller (1825–1888) was a 19th-century Scottish civil engineer and inventor remembered as a harbour and bridge-builder.
Life.
He was born on 9 January 1825 the son of Isabella Paul and Stephen Miller, a coppersmith and brassfounder, living and working at 48 Saracens Lane in Glasgow. The premises was taken over by Walter Macfarlane in 1850 and became world famous as the Saracen Foundry.
Daniel was apprenticed to Gordon &amp; Hill and here he met Robert Bruce Bell (1823-1883) with whom he later went into partnership.
In 1850 he was working without Hill at 13 Robertson Street as Daniel Miller &amp; Co.
Around 1855 he teamed with Robert Bruce Bell with offices at 32 St Vincent Street. By 1860 they are listed as Bell &amp; Miller with Miller then living at 4 Bothwell Street. They were the official engineers to the Clyde Navigation Trust and the Glasgow Bridges Trust.
He died on 28 September 1888 at "Craigburn" on Albert Road in Gourock. He is buried in Craigton Cemetery in south-west Glasgow.
Although both partners were dead, the practice of Bell &amp; Miller continued until the 1890s.
Principal Works.
They also did harbour works in Alexandria, Egypt and on the Baltic coast in Riga.
They engineered water supply schemes for Grangemouth and for Rio Grande and Pelotas in Brazil.

The Sahara Seamounts are a group of seamounts which are located in the Atlantic Ocean between southwest of the island of El Hierro, part of the Canary Islands. A number of these seamounts are placed on the sea bed at depths of almost and some summits are just below sea level. An example of this is the seamount called Echo, which is also called the Endeavour Bank, where the summit is made up of a large plateau covering an area of , at depths of between and with the slopes dropping down to into the deep. The presence of seismic lines around these seamounts show local unconformity or even sills which are quite high up among the sedimentary series and these features suggest that there was volcanic activity as late as at least the Cenozoic.
These seamounts are home to a variety of marine life including deep-sea sharks (such as the Bluntnose sixgill shark "Hexanchus griseus", rays, wreckfish, conger eels, gadellas, escolars, roughies and other species of fish that occur in the extensive areas of sponges, gorgonians and corals. They contain the most southerly known beds of the glass sponges "Asconema setubalense". Images taken from an ROV show that these seamounts have rocky and sandy sea beds which are volcanic in origin and that they contain numerous caves, overhangs and cracks which shelter a variety of animals.
These seamounts may be rich in certain minerals and the crust is rich in cobalt, as sampling at the Tropic Seamount, one of the Sahara Seamounts, showed.

Eliza was launched in 1789 in New Brunswick. Between 1791 and 1800 she made six voyages as a whaler. She next made one voyage as a slave ship. She then disappears from online resources.
Career.
Whaler.
"Eliza" enters "Lloyd's Register" in 1791 with Middleton, master, Champion, owner, changing to or from BlackB__c_, and trade London–South Seas.
Captain Thomas Middleton sailed from England on 23 January 1791, bound for the Brazil Banks. "Eliza" was reported to have been at Cape Verde on 22 March, Trinidade on 17 April, and Port Desire on 31 March 1792. She stopped at Rio in July to replenish her food and water, and with sick people. She returned to London on 6 November 1792. 
In 1792 Ellis replaced Middleton as master of "Eliza". Captain Reuben Ellis sailed from England in 1793, bound for Peru. "Eliza" was at Rio in April, and Paita in October. She returned on 27 October 1794 with 145 tuns of sperm oil and three tuns of whale oil.
Captain Ellis sailed again on 28 April 1795, bound for the Pacific Ocean. "Eliza" was at Rio in July for water and refreshments. She was reported to have been in the Pacific in August-September 1796, and at Coquimbo on 1 November. She was at Rio again in April 1797 for eight days. She returned to England on 14 July 1797.
In 1797 "Eliza"s master changed from R. Ellis to G. Carr, and her owner from Champion to D. Bennet.
Captain George Kerr (or Carr) sailed from England on 24 October 1797, bound for the East Coast of Africa. 
She may have sailed again on 17 February 1798. There is a report that she was at Port Jackson in September 1798, but the most comprehensive record of vessel arrivals at and departures from Port Jackson shows no vessels named "Eliza" arriving between 1794 and 1806. 
She was, however, at Delagoa Bay in late June 1798. There, on 28 June 1798, Captain Sever, of the East Indiaman , chartered "Eliza", Kerr, master, and two other English ships, "London", Keen, master, and , Hopper, master, to carry "Lion"s cargo back to England. "Lion" had been carrying a cargo from Madras and Columbo to England when she had put into Delagoa Bay in distress. Despite the efforts of the three other English ships and three American ships there, "Lion" could not be saved.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1799 shows "Eliza"s master changing from Carr to T. Oxon, and her owner from D. Bennett to Chamley. Her trade remains London–South Seas fisheries.
Captain Thomas Oxton acquired a letter of marque on 17 June 1799. There is a record that "Eliza" returned to England on 1 June 1800.
"Lloyd's Register" for 1800 shows "Eliza"s owner changing from Chamley to Vickers &amp; Co. Her trade changed from London–South Seas to Liverpool–"Makin". The next year her master changed from T. Oxon to J. Scott, and her trade changed from London–Martin to Liverpool–Africa.
Slave trading voyage (1801–1802).
Captain Joseph Scott acquired a letter of marque on 31 August 1801. However, Captain Chambers Reid replaced him and acquired a letter of marque on 19 September. 
Captain Chambers Reed sailed "Eliza" from Liverpool on 17 September 1801. She arrived at Havana on 15 July 1802. She had embarked 218 slaves and disembarked 196, for a loss rate of 10.1%.
Fate.
"Eliza"s fate is currently obscure. Although "Lloyd's Register" carries her for some more years with Reed, master, Vickers, owner, and trade London–Africa, there is no record in the slave trade database of any subsequent slaving voyages, or even that she returned from her first. There is also no mention in "Lloyd's List" of a loss that can be linked to her. "Lord Melville" is last listed in the "Register of Shipping" in 1820.

Marcello Labor

Marcello Labor (8 July 1890 – 29 September 1954) – born Marcello Loewy – was an Italian Roman Catholic priest and former doctor. Labor was born to Jewish parents and was Jewish himself until his conversion to Roman Catholicism on 23 December 1914. He married Elsa Reiss in 1912 after the pair met at college in Austria and had three children together during the course of World War I. It was during that conflict that he served as a medical officer and was once a Russian captive until his release a short time later. He opened a medical practice in Pula in Croatia where he dedicated himself to the poor as well as to a range of different social issues and collaborated with Catholic Action in the region. He even changed his last name at the behest of his father in order to make him seem more Italianized.
He was a lover of literature and published around 200 articles in various newspapers and magazines. The sudden death of his wife in 1934 left him alone since his children were adults. This prompted him to join the priesthood and he was ordained as such in 1940 after the Salesians of Don Bosco rejected his application to join their religious congregation. He served as a noted preacher and spiritual director and served a Fascist exile towards the end of World War II. His Jewish origins and his status as a priest saw Josip Broz Tito and his communists imprison him for several months.
Labor died from a heart attack in late 1954 as he himself predicted. His cause for canonization was launched some decades after and culminated on 5 June 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed his life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable.
Life.
Marcello Labor was born in mid-1890 in Trieste as the second of two children born to the Hungarian-born banker (and Jewish) Carlo (18.08.1856–30.07.1931) and the Italian-born Miriam Forti (26.10.1865–07.10.1897). His brother was Ferruccio (08.05.1888–28.01.1923) and his sole maternal uncle was Gino Forti (11.06.1864–08.12.1914). His father was from Kanisza.
From his childhood he loved to write and often kept diaries and correspondence with other contemporaries during the course of his studies in Trieste. Those he corresponded with included people such as Guido Devescovi and Scipio Slataper. He also became friends with Guglielmo Reiss-Romoli who later became his brother-in-law. His love for literature would be something that would grow over time and remain until his death decades later. He later attended the college in Vienna where he would meet his future wife Elsa Reiss (17.01.1891–17.01.1934) whom he married in the Jewish rite in 1912 in Trieste. He graduated in medicine in 1914 and received his degree in Graz. Labor and Elsa were both baptized into Roman Catholicism on 23 December 1914 and fathered three children with his wife. His children were:
Labor became a medical officer in the Italian armed forces during World War I and served on the frontlines in Austro-Hungarian territories including Ljubljana. But Russian soldiers captured him at some stage during the conflict though later released him. The conflict's end saw him settle in Pula in Croatia where he set up his medical practice and helped raise his children alongside his wife. His father also suggested he change is Jewish surname to "Labor" so as to take focus off his Jewish roots since his father predicted that this would bring trouble if he kept his original surname. Labor worked for the poor and dedicated himself to social justice issues while he also published over 200 pieces on different topics in local newspapers and magazines during the course of the 1930s. He also collaborated with the Catholic Action movement and the Saint Vincent de Paul group operating in the area. He also founded the "Catholic Center" as a place that could teach doctrine and encourage Eucharistic devotion through adoration. Labor studied the tuberculosis disease as a doctor as well as a range of other ailments in his work as a medical researcher in addition to general practitioner. Labor's extensive diaries spanned several and detailed his medical research as well as his interest in the faith and his activities while living in Pula.
But the Labor's fortunes halted in 1934 after Elsa died in Pula after a sudden decline in health that saw one of her legs amputated. His adult children had lives of their own at this point which left Labor alone to pursue his call to the priesthood after having asked for special permission to do so due to his married state and conversion. He also had a special respect for the Salesians of Don Bosco and had applied to enter their religious congregation. But he was upset when the congregation denied his request and refused him admittance which prompted him to settle on diocesan priesthood rather than religious priesthood. He commenced his ecclesial studies and later received his solemn ordination to the priesthood in Trieste in the San Giusto cathedral on 21 September 1940 from the Bishop of Trieste Antonio Santin. Labor was then appointed as the rector for Trieste seminarians and then served also as a spiritual director in Gorizia. He later served as a pastor for the San Giusto cathedral (since 1948 after the death of Monsignor Guido Galvani) and became a noted preacher and spiritual director.
From 1943 until the war's end in 1945 he was subjected to a Fascist exile due to the dual offences of being both a priest and Jewish in origin. To that end he worked as the vicar for the parish of Fossalta di Portogruaro for the duration of his exile. His misfortune continued after the war after Josip Broz Tito and his anti-Christian communists imprisoned him on 13 August 1947. Labor was tried and sentenced to imprisonment that would have seen him released in late 1948 though he was released just a few months after on 30 December. It was at some point during his priesthood that he was named as a Monsignor. Labor later was made the rector of seminarians at Capodistria.
Labor died on 29 September 1954 in Trieste at Via Besenghi due to a heart attack. He himself predicted that he would die of a heart attack. The marker for his tomb in the church of Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo reads: "Marcello Labor: former parish priest of San Giusto". In his will he asked to be buried in his soutaine with no liturgical vestments or other insignia and dictated himself the simple words that would mark his grave.
Beatification process.
The process for his beatification opened under Pope John Paul II on 25 April 1996 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Labor as a Servant of God and published the "nihil obstat" edict (no objections to the cause) that launched the diocesan process of investigation. This process was held in Trieste and was closed on 11 June 2000 with the C.C.S. providing validation for the investigation in Rome on 1 February 2001 before receiving the Positio dossier for assessment in 2004.
Nine theologians voiced their assent to the cause on 13 February 2014 as did the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. later on 2 June 2015. The process culminated on 5 June 2015 after Pope Francis confirmed that Labor lived a model life of heroic virtue and named him as Venerable.
The current postulator for this cause is the Franciscan friar Giovangiuseppe Califano.

Buttington Oak

The Buttington Oak was a tree near to Offa's Dyke at Buttington, Wales, said to have been planted to mark the site of the Battle of Buttington between the Vikings and a Mercian, Wessex and Welsh force in 893. It had been cyclically pollarded for timber until around 150 years ago. The oak tree was rediscovered in 2009. In 2017 it was badly damaged by storms, finally collapsing in February 2018.
History.
The oak was said to have been planted by locals to mark the 893 Battle of Buttington, a victory of an allied Mercian, Wessex and Welsh force against invading Vikings or as a boundary marker on Offa's Dyke. The tree was located near Welshpool and close to the dyke, an 8th-century earthwork that marked the border between Mercia and the Kingdom of Powys. The tree stood in fields on a flood plain to the north of Buttington and east of the River Severn and was accessible by a public footpath (approximately half a mile's walk from the A458 road). The oak was a working tree, being pollarded, to provide timber for the local community and may have been used to fashion weapons.
Description.
The Buttington Oak was not rediscovered until 2009 and was not protected by any legislation. At around in girth the oak was the largest tree on the dyke and the second-largest oak in Wales. It was recorded onto The Woodland Trust Ancient Tree Inventory site Tree No. 31758.
The Buttington Oak was badly damaged by storms in May 2017 which caused it to split in two. The tree fell in February 2018, an event first noticed by the man who trained the lady who recorded it in 2009. The tree was estimated to be more than one thousand years old when it died.
In March 2018, core samples were extracted from the trunk of the fallen tree by scientists from Cardiff University, assisted by the man who reported it fallen. These samples were analysed at the university initially, later being sent on to Kew scientists. Finally, samples were sent for further identification research to Professor Pedro Willem Crous at Westerdijk Institute. On 29 June 2020, the results of the research were published online at Fungal Planet. Present inside the tree were "Cryphonectria radicalis", which is a benign cousin of chestnut blight. It is the fourth record of this species for the United Kingdom and the first for Wales. A second finding was a new species of fungus that has been named "Ypsilina buttingtonensis".

Kim Cho-hi

Kim Cho-hi, nicknamed Chocho (born September 7, 1996) is a South Korean curler from Uijeongbu. She was the alternate, but now plays second for Team Kim Eun-jung. The Kim team represented South Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics where they won a silver medal.
Career.
Team Kim won the 2017 South Korean championship, qualifying the team to represent South Korea on home ice at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The team began the 2017-18 curling season by winning the 2017 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. As the host nation, the team received celebrity status in Korea as the "garlic girls", as their hometown of Uiseong is known for its garlic production. The team had an impressive run, making it all the way to the gold medal final, where they lost to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg rink. The next month, the team then played in the 2018 Ford World Women's Curling Championship where they lost in the quarterfinals.
The garlic girls did not play much in the 2018–19 season, amidst a coaching scandal, which involved the country's sport federation vice president verbally abusing the team. She did play lead for the team in the final event of the season, the 2019 WCT Arctic Cup, because her skip Kim Eun-jung was preparing to give birth so the whole line-up shifted up a position. The team finished with an 1–3 record, missing the playoffs.
Eun-jung also did not play in the teams first few events of the 2019–20 season. This meant that Kim Kyeong-ae would play skip, Cho-hi would play third and Kim Seon-yeong and Kim Yeong-mi played their normal second and lead positions respectively. They qualified for the playoffs at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic, the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard and finished runner-up at the inaugural WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup. Kim Eun-jung rejoined the team at the 2019 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic where she would throw second stones. They had a quarterfinal finish. Team Kim also had a quarterfinal finish the following week at the 2019 Canad Inns Women's Classic where Kim Eun-jung returned to throwing skip stones. They made it to the final of the 2019 Changan Ford International Curling Elite and finished fourth at the 2019 China Open in December 2019. In the new year, they had a quarterfinal finish at the International Bernese Ladies Cup and they won the Glynhill Ladies International. It would be the team's last event of the season as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Kim rink began the abbreviated 2020–21 season by winning their national championship at the 2020 Korean Women's Curling Championship. After finishing 6–0 through the round robin, her team defeated Kim Min-ji 6–5 in the 1 vs. 2 page playoff game and won 7–5 over Gim Un-chi in the championship final. Their win qualified them to represent Korea at the 2021 World Women's Curling Championship. There, the team had a slow start, losing their first four games before going 7–2 in their final nine games. Their 7–6 record placed them seventh after the round robin, not enough to qualify for the playoffs and the 2022 Winter Olympics. The team also changed home clubs during the season, switching from the Uiseong Curling Club to the Gangneung Curling Centre after their contract expired with the Gyeongsangbukdo Sports Council.

Robert Cummings (rowing)

Robert Arthur Cummings (19 May 1899 – 26 May 1969) was an Australian rowing coxswain. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia in the 1924 Summer Olympics in the stern of the men's eight.
Club and state rowing.
Cummings was employed as a Postal Assistant and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Cummings was coxswain in each of those crews and steered the 1920, 1922 and 1923, South Australian eights to victory. In 1921, 1922 and 1923 he was in those crews with his older brother Frank Cummings.
International representative rowing.
The South Australian media pushed for the victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Cummings and the South Australian crew including his brother Frank, were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Cummings) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm.
In the Olympic regatta, with Cummings in the stern the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.
Bob Cummings continued on as a first-class coxswain after the Olympics. He coxed South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second).

Vulvar Crohn's disease

Crohn’s disease (CD) of the vulva is a rare extra intestinal condition, with granulomatous cutaneous lesions affecting the female genitalia. Lesions connected to the affected gut via a healthy tissue are referred to as metastatic lesions.
Presentation.
Most common clinical manifestation of vulvar CD is unilateral labial swelling associated with chronic vulvar ulceration, along with perianal lesions which were reported in 48% of the patients.
Dermatologic inflammatory vulvo-vaginal lesions are usually caused by fistulas arising from the anus or rectum. However, not all inflammatory lesions within the genitalia are caused in fistulas fashion, even in patients suffering from gastrointestinal Crohn’s disease.
Similar clinical lesions have been reported in male genitalia affecting the penis and the scrotum.
Vulvar CD bears no typical symptoms and is only diagnosed and associated with gastrointestinal CD based on vulvar ulcers and hypertrophic lesions. Some patients do, however, report vulvar pain, pruritus, dyspareunia or dysuria.
Upon examination, at least one of 4 types of vulvar lesions can be present.
Vulvar swelling, edema; inflammatory and asymmetrical swelling affecting both labia minora and majora or the vaginal wall. Swelling affects approximately 67% of patients with vulvar CD.
Ulceration; may vary in numbers, size and depth from patient to patient. However, linear ulcers extending to the groin are typical for genital CD. Vulvar ulcers were present in approximately 40% of the patients.
Hypertrophic lesions; may either affect the whole labia or be localized. Hypertrophic lesions are not inflammatory and there are no functional symptoms and the main issue seems to be their unpleasant appearance. Their exhibition has been reported in approximately 24% of vulvar CD patients.
Chronic suppuration; vulvar abscesses have been reported in approximately 17% of the patients.
Course of the disease.
The progress of vulvar CD is unpredictable; spontaneous healing has been reported, as well as cases requiring surgery or vulvectomy.
Diagnosis.
The most reliable diagnostic tool for vulvar CD is histological analysis of biopsies. Positive diagnosis is further supported by the presence of chronic inflammatory infiltrates, epidermal ulceration, along with noncaseating tuberculoid granulomas. Proper testing should also include vaginal smear for detection of several viral species, blood cell count and serology for HIV, C-reactive protein and TPHA-VDRL. Visual investigation can also be useful in case of abscesses or fistulated lesions. Vulvar CD bears great clinical similarity to Behcet’s disease.
Management.
The treatment of vulvar CD mostly consists of medical therapy with only a few cases having to resort to surgery. This therapy is based on corticosteroids, the immunosuppressive effect of which is commonly used for the treatment of regular gastrointestinal CD. Corticosteroids may be administered on their own, or combined with either metronidazole or azathioprine, or both, for increased efficiency. However, direct injection or local administration of corticosteroids has been mostly unsatisfactory.
The anti-TNFα treatment has also been successful in 5 out of 6 reported cases, with infliximab being applied either alone or combined with azathioprine or methotrexate. Administration of infliximab has provided only after previous treatment with antibiotics or immunosuppressive.
Surgical approach has been conducted in a minority of cases and mostly consists of either vulvectomy, laser vaporization, lesion excision, or vulvar abscess draining. Surgical management has unfortunately been comparably more unsuccessful than medical, and should only see minimal use, with the exception of cases nonresponding to medical treatment, drainage of vulvar abscesses and resection of surface lesions.

Ali Soozandeh

Ali Soozandeh (born 22 March 1970), is an Iranian-born German animator and filmmaker. He is best known for the 2017 German-Austrian animated film "Tehran Taboo", which explores sexual and gender double standards in Iran.
Early life and education.
Soozandeh was born in Shiraz, Iran. He studied art in Tehran before emigrating to Germany in 1995. After emigrating to Germany, he received a diploma in Media Design from the Technical University of Cologne. He is the only member of his family who lives outside Iran.
Career.
In Germany, Soozandeh worked as an animation specialist in film and television, directing music videos and other short films. and founded his own company, Intaktfilm. He also His work in animation included the documentary "The Green Wave" (2010), which won the Grimme Preis Award for Best Documentary. He also produced the animated sequences of "", a 2012 German/South Korean documentary by Marc Wiese about the Kaechon internment camp, known as "Camp 14," in North Korea.
"Tehran Taboo".
His first feature film was "Tehran Taboo", an animated film which explores "the secret life of young people in Iran struggling to express their sexuality and embrace life while living under the country's oppressive, theocratic regime". The film had its premiere at the International Critics' Week sidebar of the 70th Cannes Film Festival in May 2017. and opened to generally favorable reviews in the U.S. in February 2018. The film has attracted attention for its subject matter and its visual style, which "The Hollywood Reporter" has described as "a unique combination of rotoscoping and motion capture with hand-drawn and computer animation".
Soozandeh told "HuffPost" that the inspiration for the film came from a conversation he overheard between two young Iranians on a train, concerning their experiences with women in Iran. One of them talked about a prostitute who took her child along when meeting clients. The anecdote about the prostitute and child was the "lightning bolt" that made him want to tell this story, and it became one of the plot elements in "Tehran Taboo". The title was derived from sex being a taboo subject in Iran which people are not allowed to talk about openly. The film, he says, is about "breaking silence, breaking taboos". He has said that his aim in making the film was to promote social change in his native country.
Since the film could not possibly be made in Tehran, Soozandeh used the rotoscoping technique, which combines animation with live action, thereby allowing Iranian visual elements to be superimposed on each scene.

Oak at the Gate of the Dead

The Oak at the Gate of the Dead (in Welsh: "Derwen Adwy'r Meirwon"), or Crogen Oak is a veteran tree in 
 Wrexham County Borough, Wales. Located near the 8th-century Offa's Dyke, the tree is thought to be more than 1,000 years old. The tree is located near the site of the 1165 Battle of Crogen, and is named for a supposed burial site of battle dead nearby.
Location.
The oak, a "Quercus robur", is situated near Wrexham in modern Wales. It lies on Offa's Dyke Path which runs near to Offa's Dyke, a circa 8th-century Anglo-Saxon border earthwork between Mercia and the Welsh Kingdoms. It is located around from Chirk Castle, at the entrance to the Ceiriog Valley and next to a public road (the B4500).
History.
The oak is estimated to be more than 1,000 years old and it has been associated with the reign of King Ecgberht of Wessex (802–839). If the estimated age is correct, the oak was standing in 1165 when the Battle of Crogen was fought at the location and has therefore been described as the "only living witness to this battle". A Welsh army under Owain Gwynedd inflicted a defeat upon the English king Henry II and forced him to retreat. The battle's dead were said to have been buried in the ditch of the dyke at that point: in the 19th century this was known as "Adwy'r Beddau", the pass, or gap, of the graves, with some of the graves still being visible as late as 1697 according to one account. Two or three parcels of land on either side of the dyke were also known as "Tir y Beddau", land of the graves, although one early 19th century account suggested that the place was also known as "Adwy'r Bedwen", the gap of the birch tree. The tree has in recent years been promoted as a symbol of the Battle of Crogen, under the name "Oak at the Gate of the Dead", and in March 2009 a plaque was unveiled honouring this link. In cold weather in February 2010 the tree split into two and was subsequently afforded the protection of a tree preservation order by Wrexham County Borough Council.
The oak is a well-known and valued local landmark and was one of the first trees in the world to have its own Facebook page. Since being identified and named in 2007 by Woodland Trust recorder Rob McBride it has been featured in such programmes as Countryfile, BBC Midlands news, BBC Wales TV, BBC Radio Wales, and BBC Radio Shropshire, and its story was told in a film made by Take 27 Ltd and shown at the Wrexham Histories Festival on 4 February 2011. The Woodland Trust entered the tree into the European Tree of the Year awards in 2014, the first time a Welsh tree had been nominated.

Ambush of Tagarangabotte

The Ambush of Tagarangabotte took place during the Internal conflict in Azawad. A MUJAO column en route to Menaka fell into an ambush by the MNLA.
The ambush.
MUJAO launched an attack on 16 November against the independence MLNA forces in Menaka, while the latter continued their attacks aimed at retaking the town of Gao. According to statements by Moussa Ag Assarid, in charge of Communication and Information of the MLNA, on 16 November at 10 am, a column of MUJAO vehicles was ambushed by the MNLA at Tagarangabotte, in the east, from Ansongo on the road to Menaka. According to the first assessment of the MNLA, none of its fighters were killed, but nine were wounded and one vehicle was destroyed, while the Islamists had more than 20 dead and dozens wounded and three vehicles destroyed.
MNLA spokesman Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed said:"Two armed MNLA brigades led respectively by the Deputy Chief of Staff, Machkanani Ag Balla and the leader of the commando groups, Colonel Moulay Ag Sidi Molla opened crossfire early this morning November 16 around 11 am in the locality of Ansongo and of its environs (near the town of Gao) held by terrorist groups of Mujao and those of Belmokhtar. " 
In an interview with Le Temps de l'Agérie, published on 19 November 2012, Hama Ag Sid'Ahmed stated: "MNLA troops are positioning themselves against the terrorist groups that have gathered around Ansongo (one position 30 km away and another 50). In the morning, MNLA mobile troops opened fire on both positions of terrorist groups in the area. The MNLA opens crossfire. The terrorist groups had initially sent the new recruits to the fire. The real terrorists stayed behind. It was only mid-day on November 16, when the terrorists noticed that their recruits were falling and that the terrorist ambulances quickly took over to evacuate a few dozen dead and nearly 60 to 70 wounded. Some terrorist leaders had come forward and engaged in hostilities. These are those who came to create the Mujao with the help, Pakistanis (instructors and strategists), Tunisians and Moroccans, including those who had been rejected by Western Sahara officials. Some fighters and heavy weapons belonging to the group of Benlmoctar entered the fights against the Tuareg towards the end of the day of November 16th. There was a coalition of terrorists coming from all over against the Tuaregs. It must be said that the MNLA Chief of Staff, Machkanani Ag Balla, went straight with his group to join the terrorist camp. And the other MNLA brigades also followed. The fighting was very violent. A huge fire blanket was coming from both sides. The MNLA, at the beginning of the day of 17 November, had taken account of its losses. Indeed, there were 3 seriously wounded and 6 light and no death was lamented in the ranks of Tuareg fighters during these fights."
According to Ibrahim Ag Assakeh, a member of an MNLA delegation in Ouagadougou , the ambush was happened 50 kilometers west of Ansongo , 13 MUJAO fighters were killed and 17 wounded, as against 9 wounded men on the MNLA side, including a serious one. He also added that the fighting continued . Colonel Mechkanine, number 2 of the MNLA staff, was among the wounded.
The success of the MNLA, however, seems to have been only temporary and insufficient to stop the Islamist offensive, according to a security source from Burkina Faso, the same day the MUJAO attacked elements of the MNLA in the village of Idelimane to 80 kilometers of Menaka , the last bastion of the MNLA. According to the same source, "The Mujao has taken a lot of prisoners and taken two vehicles, there have been deaths. "

Cascais tide gauge

The Cascais tide gauge () was the first tide gauge (also known as a mareograph or marigraph, as well as a sea-level recorder) installed in Portugal and dates back to 1882. It is situated in Cascais Municipality, Lisbon District. It was one of the first systems of sea-level data collection installed on the coast of Europe and is still in use.
History.
Located at the entrance to the Bay of Cascais, below the Citadel of Cascais and to the northeast side of Cascais Marina, and covered by a hemispherical dome, this tide gauge was built in 1877 in Paris by the clockmakers Amédée-Philippe Borrel and Jean Wagner. The gauge was considered necessary because of the difficulties with access to the port of Lisbon as a result of a sand bar in the river Tagus. When it began operations there were only three other sites with similar equipment in the world, at Brest, Aberdeen and Hook of Holland. It was originally installed in 1882 at another location, close to the marine biology laboratory established in the Citadel by King Carlos I who was a keen oceanographer and carried out twelve expeditions for this purpose. The gauge made it possible to measure the average water level along the Portuguese coast and was used for the completion of the geodesic survey of mainland Portugal, which was conducted between 1857 and 1892. The altimeter "reference-zero" (mean sea level), used by all Portuguese cartography, was based on its readings. The gauge employs an analog measuring system, working with a float that is placed in a well into which enters water connected directly to the sea. The movement of the float is transmitted by a system of ropes and pulleys connected to a measuring system, more precisely to a pen that registers on a sheet of paper on a rotating circular drum, similar to the system employed by a Barograph.
Use of data.
At the end of the 19th Century the gauge was moved by around 30 metres to its current position, since the data collected at the original location were not very reliable due to the distance from the open sea. The gauge has been in continuous operation since 1895. It is one of the oldest still active, and has provided a lengthy time series that, for example, confirms that the average sea level has risen by about 15cm or by 1.3 mm per year since it was installed. Its readings are used by the scientific community, nationally and internationally, and are sent to and are available from the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level.
Recent developments.
Adaptations were made in 1996 to incorporate more modern measuring systems but the original equipment is still used for calibration purposes. All measurements made since the inception of the gauge are in the process of being digitized. It was originally planned to incorporate a new acoustic digital system in the existing structure. However, there were two problems with this; the fact that the addition of a digital system would affect the inflow and outflow of water into the analog well, and the impact of the new marina on the accuracy of the gauges, as a result of a delay in the arrival of the waves. It was therefore decided to proceed with the installation of the digital acoustic system elsewhere and infrastructure for this is now located in the Administration building of the new marina about 250 meters from the analog tide gauge. Tests for this began in July, 2003 and the system came into full operation in October, 2003. Data from this is transmitted by GSM. However, the original gauge is still in use, operated by the Portuguese Geographic Institute. As a result of collaboration between the Municipality of Cascais and the Institute, the gauge can be visited by appointment.

Elisa Izaurralde

Elisa Izaurralde (20 September 1959 in Montevideo, Uruguay – 30 April 2018 in Tübingen, Germany) was an Uruguayan biochemist and molecular biologist. She served as Director and Scientific Member of the Department of Biochemistry at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen from 2005 until her death in 2018. In 2008, she was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize, shared with Elena Conti, for "fundamental new insights into intracellular RNA transport and RNA metabolism". Together with Conti, she helped characterize proteins important for exporting mRNA out of the nucleus and later in her career she helped elucidate mechanisms of mRNA silencing, translational repression, and mRNA decay.
Early life and education.
Elisa Izaurralde was born in Montevideo, Uruguay on September 20, 1959. At the age of 17 she left Uruguay to pursue an education at Geneva University in Switzerland. After undergraduate training in biochemistry, she went on to receive a PhD in molecular biology in 1989, for work on chromatin organization she performed under the guidance of Ulrich Laemmli.
Career.
After receiving her PhD, Izaurralde stayed on in Laemmli's lab for an additional year as a postdoctoral researcher before starting a second postdoctoral position at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg in 1990, working with Iain Mattaj. It was here that she switched her focus from DNA to RNA and met biophysicist Elena Conti, with whom she would share the 2008 Leibniz Prize.
In 1996, she returned to Geneva University, where she led her first work group as a junior research group leader in the Department of Molecular Biology. In this position, she researched the mRNA export factor TAP-p15, before returning to EMBL in 1999, where she extended this line of research together with Elena Conti.
Izaurralde worked as a group leader and later a senior scientist at EMBL before becoming Director of the Biochemistry Department at the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen in 2005.
She co-organized numerous meetings and conferences including multiple meetings on translational control and non-coding RNA at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, EMBO/EMBL Symposia on "The non-coding genome," and the 2010 RNA society meeting. She also served as an editor for a number of scientific journals including the "FEBS Journal" and "PLOS Biology". She was elected to the Board of Directors of the RNA Society in 2004. Beginning in 2020, the RNA Society began awarding the “Elisa Izaurralde Award for Innovation in Research, Teaching, and Service″ with the first awardee being Lori Passmore.
Research.
In order to make a protein, genetic information in DNA is copied (transcribed) into messenger RNA (mRNA) in the nucleus and then exported into the cytoplasm, where it is translated into a protein. Much of Izaurralde's early career focused on elucidating how this export occurs at a molecular level.
Later in her career, Izaurralde shifted her focus to a different aspect of RNA biology: RNA metabolism - particularly how mRNA molecules are selectively silenced. Her research in this area included studying mRNA silencing, in which microRNA (miRNA) molecules with sequences complementary to sites in the mRNA direct silencing machinery to the mRNA, as well as more general mRNA decay and transcriptional repression mechanisms, and how these processes are interconnected. She discovered a family of scaffolding proteins called GW182 that is important for helping the effector molecule carrying the miRNA (a member of the Argonaute family of proteins) recruit additional silencing co-factors including deadenylase complexes.

5th Cruiser Squadron

The 5th Cruiser Squadron and also known as Cruiser Force D was a formation of cruisers of the British Royal Navy from 1907 to 1915 and then again from 1939 to 1946.
History.
First formation.
The squadron was first established in 1907, it was attached to the Nore Division in home waters between March 1908 and February 1909 the squadron was assigned to the Home Fleet. It was then allocated to the Atlantic Fleet in April 1909 until April 1912. From May 1912 to July 1914 it was seconded to the Second Fleet .It was disbanded just before the start of World War I.
Second formation.
The squadron reformed in April 1939, and then it came under the Commander-in-Chief, China until 1942. The squadron was then reassigned to the Eastern Fleet until October 1944. It was then attached to the East Indies Fleet. It continued to serve in the Far East Fleet, with its admiral also wearing the flag of Second-in-Command of the Fleet, until the late 1950s-early 1960s.
After the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, William Andrewes was promoted to vice admiral on 1 December 1950. On 17 December 1950 Andrewes was appointed commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron and Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet, flying his flag in the light cruiser . he commanded British and Commonwealth Naval Forces, with the carrier as his flagship. He had two aircraft carriers available at any one time which he worked in eighteen-day cycles. and then Task Force 95 (comprising all Blockade and Escort ships in Korean waters, affiliated with the United Nations Command) in 1951.

Opataouaga Lake

Opataouaga Lake is a freshwater body of the Broadback River hydrographic slope of the municipality of Eeyou Istchee James Bay (municipality), in the administrative region of Nord-du-Québec, in Quebec, in Canada.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with a large navigable body of water upstream of Lake Poncheville, and downstream Quénonisca Lake and the Broadback River.
The hydrographic slope of lake Opataouaga is accessible through the forest road R1023 (East-West direction) coming from the West and passing north of “Île au Pain de Sucre” ("English: Sugarloaf Island"); the R1023 connects the "James Bay Road" (North-South direction) that comes from Matagami; from “Île au Pain de Sucre”, this road heads north-east to the west side of Lac Rocher.
The surface of Opataouaga Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
Of Cree origin, this hydronym means "the lake with the sandy tip". This toponymic designation is indicated in the "Fifth Report of the Geographic Board of Canada 1904", published in Ottawa in 1905, page 46, under the graph: "Opatawaga; Lake, Northeast of Mattagami Lake, Abitibi District, Que. (Not Opiwatakan)".
The toponym "Lake Opataouaga" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, at the creation of this commission.

Niel Gow's Oak

Niel Gow's Oak is a 300-year old tree located near Dunkeld and Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland. It is closely associated with the Scottish fiddler and composer Niel Gow who lived in nearby Inver. Gow is said to have composed many of his most famous tunes whilst sitting beneath the oak. The connection is commemorated by a plaque and engraved bench. The tree has been entered into the Scottish and European Tree of the Year competitions. Niel Gow's Oak was badly damaged by storms in 2011 and 2012.
Description.
Niel Gow's Oak is a sessile oak ("Quercus petraea") located near to the towns of Dunkeld and Birnam, Perthshire, Scotland that is around 300 years old. It lies within the Craigvinean Forest on the south bank of the River Tay. It accessible by the public and lies on the Inver Walk public footpath, part of the Dunkeld Path Network. It lies between the path and the riverbank in a field used to graze sheep and horses. 
Niel Gow connection.
Niel Gow (1727–1807) was a Scottish fiddler who lived in nearby Inver and composed many Scottish country dance tunes. The oak has been linked to Gow since at least 1855 when it featured in an "Illustrated London News" article. The connection was also made in an 1881 journal article. Gow is said to have sat beneath the tree to compose many of his most famous tunes. The music could be heard from the far bank of the Tay by John Murray, 4th Duke of Atholl who was said to have been so impressed that he paid Gow a retainer to play at family functions. 
In recognition of the connection the Forestry Commission, which owns the tree and the land it stands on, erected a bench under the tree. It was engraved with the words "sit beneath the fiddle tree, with the ghost of Niel Gow next to me" – lyrics taken from the song "Niel Gow's Apprentice" by Scottish singer-songwriter Michael Marra.
Recent events.
The tree was entered into the European Tree of the Year awards in 2014, becoming the first Scottish entry into the competition. The tree came in 7th place (out of 10) with 1,740 votes. It also made the six-strong shortlist for Scotland's Tree of the year 2016. The tree was badly damaged by a storm in December 2011 and again in 2012 when falling branches destroyed the carved bench commemorating Gow. A replacement bench was unveiled by Michael Marra's widow on 25 March 2013.

Kevin Ceceri

Kevin Alejandro Ceceri (born 2 February 1996) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a left back for Bolivian club Club San José.
Career.
Ceceri started his Gimnasia y Esgrima senior career in 2016, making his professional debut in the Argentine Primera División on 10 April during a defeat to Belgrano. That was one of four appearances for Ceceri with Gimnasia y Esgrima in 2016, prior to two more during 2016–17. On 4 July 2018, Ceceri completed a move to Segunda División B side Linense of Spain. Despite regularly featuring in pre-season friendlies, notably against the likes of Cádiz, Córdoba and Mallorca, the defender didn't appear in competitive action; he was an unused substitute for a fixture with UCAM Murcia on 26 August, but his contract was terminated soon after.
In June 2019, after a number of months without a club, Ceceri returned to Argentine football with Guillermo Brown of Primera B Nacional.

William Averell

William Averell ("baptised" 12 February 1556 – "buried" 23 September 1605) was an English pamphleteer, prose writer, parish clerk, and schoolmaster. He is best known as the author of "A Mervalious Combat of Contrarieties" (1588) that William Shakespeare used as the source for the parable of the revolt of the members against the belly in "Coriolanus".
Birth, life, and death.
Averell's baptism on 12 February 1556 is recorded in the records of the parish of St Peter upon Cornhill. His father, a joiner, was John Averell (d. 1569), and his mother Margareth (d. 1578). Nothing is known about his early life and education, but William E. Burns, writing about Averell in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", notes that he was a member of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors and the Worshipful Company of Vintners. Burns also notes that Averell's prose is Euphuistic and draws on classical knowledge, despite there being no record of his having graduated from Oxford or Cambridge.
On 2 November 1578 he married Gyllian Averell, née Goodale (1556–1596), the daughter of a baker, Robert Goodale and his wife, Ann. Their first child, Annes, was born three months after the wedding. Burns points out the irony of Averell conceiving a child before marriage given the moralism of some of his pamphlets. Gyllian Averell died in 1596, shortly after the birth of their 17th child.
Averell remarried and had a further daughter, Elizabeth, born 28 November 1597. Averell died in 1605 and was buried in St Peter upon Cornhill on 23 September.
Works.
Averell supported himself by working as a parish clerk and schoolmaster in St Peter upon Cornhill, where he adorned the parish registers with drawings and poems. He was also a pamphleteer and prose writer, and "published several works showing literary versatility and a keen desire to acquire the patronage of the London civic élite."
His first known publication, "An excellent historie, both pithy and pleasant, on the life and death of Charles and Julia, two Brittish, or rather Welsh lovers" (1581), was a verse story of star-crossed lovers set in the period of British mythology at the time of Brutus of Troy, and was dedicated to Henry Campyon, a mercer and brewer. Burns describes it as "not a distinguished piece of literature", but it was one of the few romantic poems of the period that used a British rather than Italian setting.
The next was "A wonderfull and straunge newes, which happened in the county of Suffolke, and Essex, the first of February, being Friday, where it rayned wheat, the space of vi or vii miles compass" (1583). This was a prodigy pamphlet that took a zealously Protestant stand, arguing that the referenced wonder was a sign of the end of the world. It was followed by "A Dyall for Dainty Darlings" (1584), dedicated to William Wrathe, warden of the Mercers' Company. This was expanded and reissued as "Four Notable Histories" (1590), now dedicated to Hugh Ofley.
The publication for which Averell is best known is "A Mervalious Combat of Contrarieties" (1588). It begins as a dialogue between the parts of the body in which the tongue urges the body to revolt against the belly and back because of their greed and pride, but is ultimately unmasked as a traitor. Averell eventually abandons the dialogue format and concludes with an exhortation to loyalty to the queen. It was published during the Armada crisis, dedicated to Sir George Bond, the Lord Mayor of London, and includes fierce attacks on Roman Catholics and Jesuits. It was also the principal source for William Shakespeare's use of the parable of the revolt of the members against the belly in "Coriolanus".

Jamil Hamoudi

Jamil Hamoudi (1924–2003) was an Iraqi artist who became the Director of the Ministry of Culture's Fine Arts Department. He is noted for his involvement in various Iraqi and Arabic art movements including the Hurufiyya movement which bridged the gap between traditional and modern Iraqi art.
Life and career.
Hamoudi started out as a self-taught sculptor in Baghdad. He developed a naturalistic style. In 1944, he was taken on to teach drawing and art history at a school in Baghdad. At the same time he attended classes at the Baghdad College of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1945 and in 1947, took a government scholarship to go to Paris, to study at the École Nationale Supérieure des Beaux-Arts, Académie Julian, and École du Louvre. He also Hamoudi researched the Assyrian-Babylonian art and languages.
In 1943, he created what has been described as the first Iraqi sculpture; a figure of the 11th-century philosopher-poet, Al-Maʿarri. By 1947, he was experimenting with abstract paintings using Arabic characters, and as such was one of the early pioneers of hurufiyya art. This led him on a path to discover the graphic possibilities of the letter in art. 
Certain art historians regard him as the "founding father" of the hurufiyya movement (alphabetical art movement or Letrism movement). However, other scholars have suggested that the movement began somewhat earlier with the work of the Iraqi-American artist, Madiha Omar who exhibited huryifiyya artwork in 1949 in Washington. Whether he was the movement's founder, or simply helped to popularise the hurufiyya genre, there can be little doubt that he was a leading light in Iraq's modern art movement.
He defined his use of Arabic script in the context of rediscovering his own heritage, amid his studies of European art. He wanted to cling onto his own values and traditions as a means of avoiding being overtaken by experiences outside his own heritage. He wrote that there was nothing more sacred that the Arabic alphabet, saying that his art was "a form of prayer."
Hamoudi actively contributed to Iraqi arts culture through his membership of various art groups and societies in Iraq, and by organising exhibitions for up-coming artists, at a time when Iraq had no public galleries. In 1952, he organised an exhibition, entitled "L'Ensemble "A"" at the Institut Endoplastique in Paris. In 1971, he became a founding member of the One Dimension Group, started by his friend and colleague, artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said. In 1971 he joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said and which sought to use art as a means of developing a sense of national identity. Jamil defined his use of Arabic script as a rediscovery of Iraqi heritage, within the confines of European abstract art. Hamoudi and the art groups in which he was involved were largely responsible for bridging the gap between modernity and heritage, and establishing Iraqi modern art. 
In 1973 he was appointed as Director of Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture.
Work.
Hamoudi's early works reveal the influence of Cubism movement and later he identified himself with the surrealist movement. In time, however, he distanced himself from Surrealists, claiming: 
Ultimately, he developed his own style; one that referenced his Iraqi heritage, but also used modern techniques. His paintings are brightly colored and make use of geometric shapes like circles, triangles and arches, often in repeating patterns, a reference to Arabesque. For sculpture he frequently used plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.d

Sycamore Gap Tree

The Sycamore Gap Tree or Robin Hood Tree is a sycamore tree standing next to Hadrian's Wall near Crag Lough in Northumberland, England. It is located in a dramatic dip in the landscape and is a popular photographic subject, described as one of the most photographed trees in the country. It derives its alternative name from featuring in a prominent scene in the 1991 film "". The tree won the 2016 England Tree of the Year award. 
Location.
The Sycamore Gap Tree is by Hadrian's Wall, between Milecastle 39 and Crag Lough, about west of Housesteads Roman Fort in Northumberland, northern England. This section of the wall follows the edge of a cliffan outcrop of the Whin Silland several sharp dips in it caused by melting glacial waters. The tree stands within one of these dips with the cliff and wall rising dramatically either side of it. The wall and adjacent land, including the site of the tree, are owned by the National Trust. A popular tourist attraction, the tree is described as one of the most photographed in the country and the location may be the most photographed point in all of Northumberland National Park. It is visible from the nearby B6318 Military Road. The name "Sycamore Gap" was coined by a National Trust employee when the Ordnance Survey were remapping the area and asked if the previously unnamed spot had a designation.
History.
The tree is a sycamore ("Acer pseudoplatanus") and is a few hundred years old. It once stood alongside others but they have been removed over time for unknown reasons, possibly to improve sightlines or for gamekeeping purposes. The tree featured in a key scene of the 1991 Kevin Costner film "", wherein Robin Hood travelled circuitously from the White Cliffs of Dover to Nottingham via Hadrian's Wall, and has subsequently become known as the "Robin Hood Tree". It appeared in the music video for Bryan Adams' "(Everything I Do) I Do It for You" which featured on the film's soundtrack; the video was shown often on the British TV series "Top of the Pops". It has also appeared in the TV crime drama "Vera" and in the documentary series "More Tales from Northumberland with Robson Green". It escaped damage on 30 May 2003 when a helicopter filming "British Isles – A Natural History" crashed around away, narrowly avoiding presenter Alan Titchmarsh. The four on board the aircraft were lightly injured.
In 2016, the tree was nominated for England's Tree of the Year competition. It was selected from 200 competitors for the final shortlist of 10 and won the competition with 2,542 votes out of 11,913. The prize was a £1000 grant which was used to survey the health of the tree and to carry out work to protect its roots, which were becoming exposed due to the high volume of foot traffic passing over them. The Sycamore Gap Tree was entered in the 2017 European Tree of the Year awards in which it came 5th out of 16, polling 7,123 votes.

King Oak

The King Oak is a tree in the grounds of Charleville Castle, Tullamore in Ireland. Descended from the ancient oak forests that were once commonplace in Ireland, the tree is estimated to be around 400 to 800 years old. The King Oak has been heavily pollarded and is a large tree, with a trunk of girth and some of the lower branches extending as far as . A superstition associated with the tree says that if one of its branches should fall a member of Bury family, long-time owners of the Charleville Estate, will die. The 1963 death of Charles Howard-Bury has been held as confirmation of this belief, following shortly after the tree was struck by lightning which split its main trunk. The tree was nominated as the Irish entry for the 2013 European Tree of the Year contest, in which it finished third.
Description.
The King Oak is located in the grounds of Charleville Castle on the outskirts of Tullamore. It stands just inside the main entrance to the estate. The tree is a pedunculate oak ("Quercus robur"), also known as a common oak, European oak, or English oak. Its trunk is in girth and the tree possesses an overall height of . The tree has large lower branches which spread for up to from the main trunk and have been propped to prevent them from falling. The Charleville estate is home to one of the largest Pedunculate Oak forests in Ireland and is also home to a plot of yew trees in the shape of the Union Flag.
History.
The King Oak is at least 400 years old and possibly up to 800 years old, with it being mentioned as an old tree in 17th-century records. The Irish Wildlife Trust has described the King Oak as one of the oldest trees in the country. The tree is thought to be a descendant of the once widespread ancient oak forests of Ireland. The tree has been heavily pollarded for timber over its life.
The King Oak has been described as the star attraction of the Charleville estate. A superstition attached to the tree says that, if one of its branches were to fall, it will foretell the death of a member of the Bury family, the long-time owners of the Charleville estate. In 1963 the tree was struck by lightning, splitting the main trunk from top to bottom and causing the loss of at least one branch. The tree survived but Colonel Charles Howard-Bury, the explorer and last member of the Bury family line died a few weeks afterwards.
The King Oak was proposed by the Just Forests conservation charity as the Irish entry for the 2013 European Tree of the Year contest. The tree made it to the six-strong shortlist and in the final poll received almost six thousand votes, putting it in third place.

Culliagh

Culliagh () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Culliagh is bounded on the west by Drumlaydan and Cronery townlands, on the south by Torrewa townland, on the north by Corratillan townland and on the east by Bellaleenan, Drumlougher and Teeboy townlands. Its chief geographical features are the River Blackwater, County Cavan, forestry plantations, spring wells and dug wells. Culliagh is traversed by the L5036 public road and rural lanes. The townland covers 265 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Culliagh was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of the four polls of "BMcGoagh" (an abbreviation of Ballemagoechan).
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 13 March 1610, King James VI and I granted "four polls of Ballemagoechan to Cahell M'Owen O Reyly". The four polls consisted of 1 in Bealaghlyan, 2 in Acoylagh and 1 in Cronarry, totalling 200 acres. The said Cathal O'Reilly was the nephew of two chiefs of the O'Reilly clan- Aodh Connallach mac Maolmhordha who was chief from 1565 to 1583 and Eamonn mac Maolmhordha who was chief from 1596 to 1601. He was also a brother of Cathaoir O'Reilly who received lands in Kildoagh townland and first cousin of Donill Backagh McShane O'Reyly who was simultaneously granted lands in Burren (townland).
An Inquisition of King Charles I of England held in Cavan Town on 31 March 1635 stated that "Cahell O Reily was seized in his lifetime of, inter alia, two polls of Acoylagh. He died 1 January 1634 and his son Hugh O'Reily had reached his majority and was married".
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the name as "Coylagh" and lists the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford".
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663, there were two people listed as paying the tax in "Colagh"- "Rory O Dolan and Teige O Dolan".
A grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet which included, inter alia, "one cartron of Cornekilleagh or Corkilleagh containing 96 acres-3 roods-8 perches of land". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the said lands of "Cornetilleagh" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Culleagh".
Lowther Kirkwood of Mullinagrave, parish of Templeport, Co. Cavan, gentleman made the following will-
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list nineteen tithepayers in the townland.
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks describe the townland as- "It is bounded on the west side by a large stream."
The Culliagh Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 118, being 51 males and 67 females. There were twenty-four houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 76, being 40 males and 36 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were seventeen houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty-four landholders in the townland.
On 6 July 1857 the Incumbered Estates Commission published the following notice-
In the Matter of the Estate of James Brien, Geo. Brien, Edward Brien and Francis Brien, Owners. Exparte by Isabella Crummer, Petitioner. The commissioners having ordered a Sale of the Lands of Shanadaragh and Curnagunlogh, Cullegh, Drumlohgher, Drumledin, Sananaragh, and Drumledin and Corlough, situate in the Barony of Tullyhaw, and County of Cavan, held under lease dated the 10th April, 1718, from the Bishop Raphoe, for lives renewable for ever, and which Lands are included in the denominations of Ballymagord, Owngally, Gortneglough, Drumedin or Ballylennin, in said lease mentioned:"
In 1861 the population of the townland was 77, being 38 males and 39 females. There were seventeen houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are fifteen families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are sixteen families listed in the townland.

Battle of Idelimane

The Battle of Idelimane took place during the Internal Conflict in Azawad.
The battle.
On November 16, MNLA forces launched an offensive to retake the city of Gao, but they came up against the Islamists forces of MUJAO and AQIM between Ansongo and Gao. On the morning of the first day, Tuareg independence forces were successful in the Ambush of Tagarangabotte 50 kilometers east of Ansongo. However, the Islamist offensive was not stopped. According to a security source from Burkina Faso, the same day MUJAO attack elements of the MNLA in the village of Idelimane 80 kilometers from Menaka , the last bastion of the MNLA. According to the same source, "The Mujao has taken a lot of prisoners and taken two vehicles, there have been deaths." 
According to the Malian newspaper Le Combat, MUJAO's forces were made up of the Osama bin Laden brigade led by Abu Walid Sahraoui and reinforced by 300 AQIM fighters, including the Mokhtar's Al-Mouthalimin brigade (the turbaned ones). Belmokhtar brought 16 pickups, many equipped with heavy artillery. For its part, the MNLA claims to have clashed with 1,000 jihadists. Xinhua News Agency sources also stated the battle was being fought 80 kilometers from Menaka and 70 kilometers from Ansongo. 
On the 17th, the MUJAO forces receive reinforcements from AQIM troops. According to security sources in Mali, the MNLA was routed on November 17 with a loss of 10 killed.
Aftermath.
On the 18th, Mossa Ag Attaher, in charge of Communication and Information of the MNLA, declared that "the terrorist hordes were driven from the former army camp of the paratroopers of the Malian army that they tried to occupy and they (the terrorists) were forced to retreat into the Tidjefenes area." According to him, 12 Islamists were killed in this military camp. According to witnesses, 6 wounded MUJAO were sent to Gao Regional Hospital. Other testimonies mention dozens of deaths. 
A report is provided by various sources to the Xinhua News Agency, including men close to the International Committee of the Red Cross. According to these sources, the fighting killed more than 117 people by 17 November, 17 for MUJAO, including Abu Dardar, Emir of Ansongo , and over 100 for the MNLA. These figures, however, seem to reflect MUJAO's estimates of the losses of the Independents. 
According to residents of Gao , on 17 November, Abdoul Hakim, a commander of MUJAO, told Nata radio that his troops had lost 3 fighters and 6 seriously wounded against more than 100 dead for MNLA forces. Next, the Battle of Menaka followed.

Never Again MSD

Never Again MSD is an American student-led political action committee for gun control that advocates for tighter regulations to prevent gun violence. The organization, also known by the Twitter hashtags #NeverAgain, and #EnoughIsEnough, was formed by a group of twenty students attending the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) at the time of the deadly shooting in 2018, in which seventeen students and staff members were killed by the alleged gunman, who was a former student at the school and armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. The organization started on social media as a movement "for survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting" using the hashtag #NeverAgain. A main goal of the group was to influence on that year's United States mid-term elections, and they embarked on a multi-city bus tour to encourage young people to register to vote.
The organization staged protests demanding legislative action to be taken to prevent similar shootings in the future and has vocally condemned U.S. lawmakers who have received political contributions from the National Rifle Association (NRA). It was credited in the "Washington Post" as winning a "stunning victory" against the NRA in the Florida legislature in March 2018 when both houses voted for various gun control measures. The law increased funding for school security and raised the required age to buy a gun from 18 to 21.
Among the organization's most prominent members are Alfonso Calderon, Sarah Chadwick, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, X González, David Hogg, Cameron Kasky, and Alex Wind. Corin, González, Hogg, Kasky, and Wind were featured on a cover of "Time" in March 2018. In December later that year, it was announced that the March for Our Lives activists made the shortlist for Time's Person of the Year at number four.
Founding.
The group was co-formed by Cameron Kasky and his high school friends in the first four days after the shooting, which was committed by a gunman who was a former student at the school and armed with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle.
The initial three co-founders were Kasky, Alex Wind, and Sofie Whitney. On February 15, 2018, one day after the shooting, Kasky met with Wind at a candlelight vigil. Wind stated, "The day after the shooting, we said something needs to happen; there needs to be a central space; there needs to be a movement." After the vigil, Kasky invited Wind and Whitney to his house. Kasky came up with the name "Never Again" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted "Stay alert. #NeverAgain" to Facebook.
Over the next three days after the shooting, the group gained over 35,000 followers on Facebook. Kasky recruited other Stoneman Douglas students David Hogg, X González, and Delaney Tarr at a gun-control rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida where they spoke; other students quickly joined. The students gave as many interviews as they could to television networks. The group said they worked quickly to take advantage of the national media attention given to the shooting and its aftermath. Numerous Stoneman Douglas students have been shown in media coverage. By the next day, the group had created Twitter accounts and announced a March for Our Lives nationwide protest, for March 24, 2018.
Stoneman Douglas teacher Ivy Schamis, who had been teaching her Holocaust History class about combating hate when the gunman fired shots into her classroom, stated she thought the Stoneman Douglas students' #NeverAgain hashtag was inspired by the class on Holocaust history. In the classroom there had been a banner saying "We Will Never Forget," which a Holocaust survivor had given to Schamis. Kelly Plaur, a student survivor from that class, is the great-granddaughter of an Auschwitz survivor. Plaur protected Schamis during the shooting. According to Schamis, the gunman was unaware he was shooting into a class on the Holocaust, even though he'd scrawled a swastika onto one of his ammunition magazines. Schamis was presented with USC Shoah Foundation’s inaugural Stronger Than Hate Educator Award in 2019. During her acceptance speech at the award ceremony, Schamis honored the two students Nick Dworet and Helena Ramsay from her class that were killed during the shooting. Schamis added, "We share our stories in the hope that others understand that hate is not OK, it's never OK."
Activism.
The Fort Lauderdale gun control rally at Broward County Federal Courthouse on February 17, 2018 was attended by hundreds of supporters. Elected officials and gun control advocates, including Florida Senator Gary Farmer, called for an increase in firearm restrictions and gun control legislation. At this rally, Emma González began her speech with a moment of silence for the 17 victims killed in the school shooting. She then gave an impassioned 11-minute speech, in which she demanded to know where the "common sense" was in America's gun laws, calling out members of Congress who have accepted contributions from the NRA. González was noted for rebuking "thoughts and prayers" from the government and President Donald Trump.
To support the gun control rally, Never Again MSD spoke out in the media about the importance of taking action to change policy. In an opinion column for CNN, Cameron Kasky wrote: "We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking—no, demanding—we take action now."&lt;ref name="Kasky_2/15/2018"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Delaney Tarr wrote an op-ed for "Teen Vogue", in which she discussed why she and her fellow students were organizing in response to the mass shooting at Parkland. She stated "Knowing that we can keep this from happening to even one more person is the only thing that makes me feel even a little bit better about living through this senseless tragedy.”
The first organized #NeverAgain movement protest was a march on the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee on February 20, 2018. The group worked with congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Florida Senator Lauren Book to arrange a bus trip for one hundred students and fifteen parent chaperones to the Capitol to voice their concerns with lawmakers and demand action on gun violence. Jaclyn Corin was a key organizer of the bus trip protest. A report in "Vanity Fair" suggested it was her idea to have the bus trip soon after the shooting because it was alive in the news cycle; she said "the news forgets – very quickly – we needed a critical mass event." Sofie Whitney, one of the organizers of the bus trip, was interviewed by CNN's Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper while on the bus en route. Several students, along with Fred Guttenberg, father of a slain student, watched from the gallery as the Florida House voted against considering a bill to ban assault weapons (such as AR-15 style rifles) and high-capacity magazines in a vote of 71 to 36. More than 3,000 people attended a rally at the Capitol the following day.
Never Again MSD and other groups have also played a part in corporations' revocation of NRA sponsorships and discounts for NRA members. Firms which have severed ties with the NRA include the First National Bank of Omaha; car rental companies Hertz, Avis, Enterprise, and Budget; insurer MetLife; Symantec software; home security firm SimpliSafe; and airlines including Delta and United.
Never Again MSD has been credited for including persons of color within their movement. Jaclyn Corin recognized that "Parkland received more attention because of its affluence," while David Hogg faulted the media for "not giving black students a voice." Alex Wind said the protests were about ending gun violence against all communities.
March for Our Lives.
March for Our Lives, a nationwide demonstration that included a march held in Washington, D.C., took place on March 24, 2018. The event was conducted in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. Hundreds of thousands of protesters showed up at demonstrations across the United States, as well as internationally, to demand action against gun violence. Many Marjory Stoneman Douglas students spoke out in Washington, DC. González briefly spoke, naming the victims, before standing silent on stage for four minutes. She was on stage for six minutes and twenty seconds, the length of the Parkland shooting.
Yolanda Renee King, Martin Luther King Jr.'s 9-year-old granddaughter brought in by Corin, said during her speech, "I have a dream that enough is enough." In addition to sharing the stage at the protest with King, they also passed the mic to Virginia African-American elementary school student Naomi Wadler. Sir Paul McCartney, speaking to CNN at a sister march in New York City, revealed his T-shirt reading "We can end gun violence."
Town halls.
Never Again MSD has worked to organize town hall meetings across the United States to hold Congress members accountable for their position on gun laws. For town halls on April 7, 2018, the group confirmed events in 30 districts. At a town hall near Parkland, supporters passed out red bumper stickers calling for an assault weapons ban.
Cross–country gun control tour.
In June 2018, Never Again MSD announced that the group would travel throughout the United States and hold rallies that summer to call for stronger gun control, and to encourage teenagers who would be eighteen by November 2018 to vote in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. The group stated that it intended to appear in cities where the NRA held the most influence. During the summer and fall, the students traveled to every district in Florida and 30 states across the country, visiting over 100 communities, registering 50,000 voters, and raising awareness about gun violence. In the weeks before the 2018 U.S. midterm elections, the group engaged in another national tour specifically focused on election-related efforts like educating, registering, and encouraging youth voters to vote in the 2018 U.S. midterm elections.
Response.
George and Amal Clooney donated $500,000 to the organization to help with the cost of organizing the March for Our Lives demonstration, which they also participated in. Following the Clooneys' announcement, other celebrities including Oprah Winfrey, Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Steven Spielberg pledged to match the $500,000 donation.
In a "CNN" editorial entitled "The NRA's worst nightmare is here," Dean Obeidallah compared Never Again MSD to the "early days of the #MeToo movement, which caused a cultural shift regarding sexual misconduct."
After some schools threatened to suspend students for participating in peaceful Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain) protests, hundreds of U.S. colleges pledged they would not penalize students disciplined for taking part. These colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida, added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges.
In March 2018, Michelle and Barack Obama penned a handwritten letter to the students of Parkland, expressing admiration for their advocacy against gun violence:
Misinformation and criticism.
Attempts to discredit the Never Again MSD movement in the media have taken the form of verbal attacks and misinformation by right-wing Republican leaders. Former Republican senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum attacked the Parkland activists verbally during an interview with "CNN", suggesting that students should take classes in CPR rather than marching in Washington. "The Washington Post" quoted several doctors ridiculing Santorum for suggesting CPR, which is useless for trauma and blood loss. Leslie Gibson, a Republican candidate for the Maine House of Representatives, disparaged X González and David Hogg, but later apologized for his comments and withdrew his candidacy. Iowa Republican Representative Steve King's campaign criticized X González for displaying her Cuban heritage.
NRA board member and rock musician Ted Nugent described the Parkland activists as "mushy brained and soulless liars,". Alex Jones, a right-wing conspiracy theorist and host of InfoWars, led a campaign to discredit Emma González, David Hogg, and other March for Our Lives protesters by comparing them to Nazis.
Fake pictures and GIFs of X González tearing up a copy of the U.S. Constitution circulated on social media in March 2018. The images were doctored from originals of González tearing up a shooting target sign. Actor and conservative commentator Adam Baldwin defended circulating the doctored images as "political satire".
New laws.
In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raised the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, established waiting periods and background checks, provided a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, banned bump stocks, and barred potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocated around $400 million. The governor signed the bill into law on March 9. He commented, "To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change." John Cassidy stated in "The New Yorker", "This was the first time in thirty years that Florida had passed any gun restrictions, and it was a direct response to the Never Again movement, which was founded by students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School." "Salon" suggested that Republican lawmakers have generally remained silent about gun control measures because "they depend heavily on NRA campaign donations, and even more on the NRA's cadre of pro-gun voters". Since February 2018, 67 new pieces of gun control legislation have been passed in 26 states across the country.

Karimala

Karimala (sometimes written as Katimala or Kadimalo) was a Nubian queen. She is known from a relief found at the temple in Semna in Nubia.
Karimala had the title of Great Royal Wife and princess. In the scene at Semna, the queen is shown with double feather crown, scourge and long robe. Isis is standing in front of the queen, and here is a longer inscription, written in Egyptian hieroglyphics, which are difficult to read. The text seems to allude to a conflict between Makarasha and an unnamed king who was the husband of Karimala.
Although the precise dating of the inscription and hence Karimala is not certain, it can be assumed that it dates back to the Twenty-First or Twenty-Second Dynasty. This period (about 1000–750 BC) is considered the dark age of Nubian history, from which almost nothing is known. This inscription proves the continuation of certain power structures.
In 1999 Chris Bennett made a case that Karimala was a daughter of Osorkon the Elder (reigned 992 – 986 BC). She is called both 'King's Daughter" and "King's Wife" and her name suggests she may have been Libyan. Given the date of the inscription (a year 14), she might have been the queen of either king Siamun (reigned 986–967 BC) or king Psusennes II (reigned 967 – 943 BC). Bennett prefers a marriage to Siamun, because in that case she could have taken over the position of the Viceroy of Kush, Neskhons, as a religious figurehead in Nubia after the death of the latter in year 5 of king Siamun.

Reifferscheid Castle

The ruins of Reifferscheid Castle () stand at a height of 450 metres above sea level (NN) near the German-Belgian border between the mountains of the Eifel and the Ardennes in the municipality of Hellenthal. Its name probably comes from a forest clearing that belonged to a man called "Rifhari", the names "Rifersceith" or "Rifheres-sceit" mean "woodland strip of Rifhari".
All that has survived of the medieval hill castle are the remains of the curtain walls, a gatehouse with two flanking round towers, a gabled entrance and a round, white-plastered bergfried made of rubble stone.
History.
Reifferscheid is first recorded in 1106 in the "Chronica regia coloniensis" under the name "Riferschit". The content of the contemporary report relates to the destruction of the castle by its owner, Duke Henry of Limburg and Lower Lorraine. He razed his castle in order to prevent in falling into enemy hands.
In 1130 a chapel near the castle was granted the status of a parish church by Archbishop Frederick I of Cologne. The new church was overseen by Steinfeld Abbey and, in 1195, the Lords of Reifferscheid are mentioned for the first time. Several years later, the brothers Gerhard and Philip of Reifferscheid divided their lordship, and a new branch of the family appeared: the lords of Wildenburg.
In 1385, shortly after John V of Reifferscheid had taken over the lordship, the castle was captured by troops of the Meuse-Rhine Alliance, the cities of Cologne and Aachen, the archbishops of Cologne and the Liège as well as the Duke of Jülich, because John had broken the "Landfrieden" by undertaking numerous raids in the local area and further afield. The siege was unsuccessful, however, and the alliance troops withdrew after three months of unfinished business.
In 1416, the Lords of Reifferscheid inherited from the Lower Salm line of the counts of Salm and henceforth called themselves "von Salm-Reifferscheid".
After a fire in 1509, the damaged castle was rebuilt. Another fire on 23 June 1669 destroyed the town of Reifferscheid and its castle completely. On the remains of the old building substance, its owner had a representative schloss built in the Baroque style, and on the foundations of the old castle walls the houses of the former Burgfreiheit were rebuilt.
But the new splendour did not last long. During the War of the Palatine Succession, troops of Louis XIV slighted the house in 1689. The reconstruction of the castle at that time must have been completed very quickly, however, because a drawing in ink by Mathieu Throuüet shows that the castle was fully restored around 1725.
Troops of the French Revolutionary Army occupied and destroyed the castle in 1794 and, in 1803, it was seized from the lords of Reifferscheid, the Barony of Reifferscheid was dissolved and the ruin was auctioned off for demolition in 1805 to raise money for the French government and went into private hands. In the following decades it served as a quarry and supplied construction material for new buildings in the surrounding area, before it was returned to the possession of the Salm-Reifferscheid family, who had meanwhile been elevated to the status of princes in 1889.
Since 1965, the ruin has been owned by the municipality of Hellenthal. The villagers of Reifferscheid have devoted themselves to its preservation over the last few decades, and the place has received several awards.

Hopeman Sandstone Formation

The Hopeman Sandstone Formation is a geologic formation in Scotland. It preserves fossil footprints and body fossils from the Guadalupian Epoch in the Late Permian, to the Early Triassic, It preserves fossils and fossil footprints from various extinct animals such as pareiasaurs and dicynodonts, which are collectively often referred to as the Elgin Reptiles.
The formation, named for the village of Hopeman, lies unconformably over the Devonian Upper Old Red Sandstone, and it underlies the waterlain sandstones of the Burghead Sandstone Formation. It represents a windswept dune landscape.
The Hopeman Sandstones were previously referred to as the Cutties Hillock Sandstone, Quarry Wood Sandstones, Sandstones of Hopeman, and Hopeman-Cummingstown Sandstone, but these names have since been superseded.
Lithology.
The Hopeman Sandstone Formation is predominantly composed of fine- to coarse-grained yellowish sand with well rounded grains, mostly deposited as wind-blown dunes, but occasionally deposited by sheet floods. Basal beds are pebbly and the unit varies, exhibiting large-scale crossbedding to fine rarely contorted laminations. Some beds are friable, while others hard and siliceous.
Origin of names.
The name "Cutties Hillock" is believed to derive from the Scottish Gaelic , meaning 'hill brow of the hunting'. The name first appeared in print after the discovery of the Elgin Reptiles in 1884.
Although now formally considered part of the Hopeman Sandstone Formation, the Cuttie's Hillock Sandstone is still used to refer to the inland outcroppings of Hopeman Sandstone, particularly at Quarry Wood near Elgin. Benton and Walker (1985) argue that the name Cuttie's Hillock Sandstone should be retained to distinguish these fossil-bearing beds from those on the coast, which have only yielded footprints and very few body fossils.
Paleobiota.
The pareiasaur "Elginia" and dicynodonts "Geikia" and "Gordonia" are known from the formation, the fossils are preserved as hollow internal moulds within the sandstone.

Descartes-class cruiser

The "Descartes" class comprised two protected cruisers of the French Navy built in the early 1890s; the two ships were and . They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the "Descartes"-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns supported by ten guns and they had a top speed of .
"Descartes" and "Pascal" were initially sent to French Indochina in the late 1890s, where they participated in the campaign to suppress the Boxer Uprising in Qing China. "Descartes" was recalled to France in 1902 to serve in the Atlantic Division while "Pascal" remained in East Asia, serving until 1904 when she was deactivated due to poor condition. "Descartes" was sent back to East Asia in 1905 and later to French Madagascar before returning to France in 1907, thereafter serving with the main French fleets in the Mediterranean Sea and English Channel. "Pascal" was sold to ship breakers in 1911, while "Descartes" served another stint in the Atlantic Division. She remained there during the first three years of World War I before returning to France in 1917, where she was disarmed and decommissioned. She was struck from the naval register in 1920, but what ultimately became of the ship is unknown.
Design.
In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships—the and es—into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a "two-power standard" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies.
The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships.
To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The "Descartes" class were ordered to as part of the program.
General characteristics and machinery.
The two "Descartes"-class cruisers were long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced . Like most French warships of the period, the "Descartes"-class cruisers' hulls had a pronounced ram bow, tumblehome shape, and a short forecastle deck . Below the waterline, the hulls were covered in a layer of wood and copper sheathing to protect them from biofouling on long voyages overseas. The ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting primarily of a small conning tower and a bridge. They were fitted with pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. The ships suffered from stability problems and had to have ballast added after completion. Their crew varied over the course of her career, and consisted of 383–401 officers and enlisted men.
The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by sixteen coal-burning Belleville-type water-tube boilers that were ducted into two funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which gave the ships a cruising radius of at and at 19.5 knots.
Armament and armor.
The ships were armed with a main battery of four Modèle 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual sponsons clustered amidships, two guns per broadside. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of . 
The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of ten Modèle 1891 guns, which were carried in a variety of mounts. Two guns fitted with gun shields were placed side-by-side on the upper deck, four more were in the upper deck forward in casemates. Another pair of guns were in sponsons further aft, and the remaining pair were in pivot mounts on the upper deck aft. The sides of the ships were recessed to allow the primary and secondary guns to fire directly ahead or astern. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of .
For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried eight 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 1-pounder guns. These were all in single pivot mounts, distributed along the length of the ships. They were also armed with two torpedo tubes in her hull above the waterline. The torpedoes were the M1892 variant, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .
Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, curving down at the sides, where it increased in thickness to . Above the deck, a cellular layer of watertight compartments was intended to contain flooding below the waterline. A light splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments that penetrated the main armor deck. The gun shields for the deck-mounted 100 mm guns were thick. The ships had plating on the conning tower.
Service history.
"Descartes" and "Pascal" were deployed to French Indochina after entering service in 1897, though "Pascal" did not leave France until after completing her sea trials by January 1898. Both ships were present during the Boxer Uprising in Qing China; they were among the vessels France contributed to the Eight-Nation Alliance that defeated the Boxers in the early 1900s. "Descartes" returned to France in 1902, when she joined the Atlantic Division, though "Pascal" remained in East Asia. "Pascal"s condition deteriorated after several years abroad, where the French lacked sufficient shipyard facilities, and by 1904, her engines could no longer reach her design speed. She saw little further use thereafter, in part because the French Navy had settled on building a fleet of armored cruisers to fulfill the roles that the "Descartes" class had been intended to fill. She was struck from the naval register in 1911 and later broken up.
In the meantime, "Descartes" was sent on a second deployment to East Asia in 1905. She had been transferred to French Madagascar by 1907, and later that year, she returned France to join the Mediterranean Squadron. "Descartes" was then transferred to the Northern Squadron. By 1914, the ship was operating with the Atlantic Division; she was patrolling in Central American waters and was slated to return to France when World War I started in July. She instead remained in the region and joined the French and British vessels searching for the German light cruiser that was attacking merchant shipping in the area, though they failed to locate her. "Descartes" spent the next three years patrolling the West Indies, seeing no action. After returning home in 1917, she was decommissioned and disarmed, her guns being used as field artillery and to arm patrol vessels. She was struck from the naval register in 1920, but her ultimate fate is unknown.

Curraghabweehan

Curraghabweehan () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Curraghabweehan is bounded on the west by Corraclassy townland, on the south by Garvary (Corlough) townland, on the north by Drumbeagh townland and on the east by Derryvahan townland. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan) and dug wells. Curraghabweehan is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 55 statute acres.
History.
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of "Drombeagh and Corroboan to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name". William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688).
The Sheridan lands in Curraghabweehan were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows:
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as "Curraghabeghan" and the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford". A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 76 acres and 3 roods in "Curraghboghan and Drumbeagh". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of "Curraghbegan and Drumbeagh" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Curraghbuhan".
An 1813 map depicts the townland as "Curraghboghan" and "Curraghoghan".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list seven tithepayers in the townland. 
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks describe the townland as- "The soil is of a clayey nature...The townland is bounded on the north side by a large stream."
The Curraghabweehan Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 32, being 15 males and 17 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 26, being 12 males and 14 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists five landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 25, being 11 males and 14 females. There were five houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are three families listed in the townland.

Sequiwaimanu

Sequiwaimanu is an extinct genus of early penguin. The type species, Sequiwaimanu rosieae, was named and described by Gerald Mayr in 2018.
It is the fourth penguin species to be discovered from the Waipara Greensand in New Zealand, which originally held two species that were assigned to the taxon "Waimanu". Also this penguin had leg bones similar to an unnamed giant penguin.

Herbert Graetz

Herbert Ephraim Graetz (16 March 1893 – 1985), also known as Harry Graetz, was a South Australian rower. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight.
Club and state rowing.
Graetz was employed as a fireman on the South Australian Railways and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Graetz was the bowman in each of those crews (though he rowed at seven in 1921) and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923.
International representative rowing.
The South Australian media pushed for Graetz's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Graetz and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Graetz in the bow, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.
Harry Graetz continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He was again in the bow of the South Australian representative eight in its King's Cup campaign of 1925 (fourth place).

Alternating conditional expectations

Alternating conditional expectations (ACE) is an algorithm to find the optimal transformations between the response variable and predictor variables in regression analysis.
Introduction.
In statistics, nonlinear transformation of variables is commonly used in practice in regression problems. Alternating conditional expectations (ACE) is one of the methods to find those transformations that produce the best fitting additive model. Knowledge of such transformations aids in the interpretation and understanding of the relationship between the response and predictors.
ACE transform the response variable formula_1 and its predictor variables, formula_2 to minimize the fraction of variance not explained. The transformation is nonlinear and is obtained from data in an iterative way.
Mathematical description.
Let formula_3 be random variables. We use formula_4 to predict formula_1. Suppose formula_6 are zero-mean functions and with these transformation functions, the fraction of variance of formula_7 not explained is
Generally, the optimal transformations that minimize the unexplained part are difficult to compute directly. As an alternative, ACE is an iterative method to calculate the optimal transformations. The procedure of ACE has the following steps:
Bivariate case.
The optimal transformation formula_19 for formula_20 satisfies
where formula_22 is Pearson correlation coefficient. formula_23 is known as the maximal correlation between formula_24 and formula_1. It can be used as a general measure of dependence.
In the bivariate case, ACE algorithm can also be regarded as a method for estimating the maximal correlation between two variables.
Software implementation.
The ACE algorithm was developed in the context of known distributions. In practice, data distributions are seldom known and the conditional expectation should be estimated from data. R language has a package acepack which implements ACE algorithm. The following example shows its usage:
 library(acepack)
 TWOPI &lt;- 8 * atan(1)
 x &lt;- runif(200, 0, TWOPI)
 y &lt;- exp(sin(x) + rnorm(200)/2)
 a &lt;- ace(x, y)
 par(mfrow=c(3,1))
 plot(a$y, a$ty) # view the response transformation
 plot(a$x, a$tx) # view the carrier transformation
 plot(a$tx, a$ty) # examine the linearity of the fitted model
Discussion.
The ACE algorithm provides a fully automated method for estimating optimal transformations in multiple regression. It also provides a method for estimating maximal correlation between random variables. Since the process of iteration usually terminates in a limited number of runs, the time complexity of the algorithm is formula_26 where formula_27 is the number of samples. The algorithm is reasonably computer efficient.
A strong advantage of the ACE procedure is the ability to incorporate variables of quite different type in terms of the set of values they can assume. The transformation functions formula_28 assume values on the real line. Their arguments can, however, assume values on any set. For example, ordered real and unordered categorical variables can be incorporated in the same regression equation. Variables of mixed type are admissible.
As a tool for data analysis, the ACE procedure provides graphical output to indicate a need for transformations as well as to guide in their choice. If a particular plot suggests a familiar functional form for a transformation, then the data can be pre-transformed using this functional form and the ACE algorithm can be rerun.
As with any regression procedure, a high degree of association between predictor variables can sometimes cause the individual transformation estimates to be highly variable, even though the complete model is reasonably stable. When this is suspected, running the algorithm on randomly selected subsets of the data, or on bootstrap samples can assist
in assessing the variability.

Thomas Dealtry (son)

 Thomas Dealtry (1825–1882) was an Anglican archdeacon in India in the mid-19th century. Dealtry was the son of Thomas Dealtry, bishop of Madras. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge and ordained in 1849. After curacies in Raydon and Brenchley he went as a chaplain to the East India Company in Madras, where he was archdeacon from 1861 to 1871. Returning to England he held incumbencies in Swillington and Maidstone. He is credited with being the originator of the custom of throwing rice at a newly married couple, which he had seen in India. He died on 29 November 1882.

Goswin de Fierlant

Goswin Anne-Marie Félix de Fierlant (ca. 1735—1804) was a holder of high office in the Austrian Netherlands who served on the Council of State, as the last president of the Great Council, and briefly as Chief President of the Privy Council.
Life.
Goswin de Fierlant was born around 1735 to Guillaume de Fierlant, schout of Turnhout, and Anne-Catherine van den Broeck. He began his public career with the city council of Brussels. In 1768 he was appointed secretary to the Brussels Privy Council, and the following year became a privy councillor himself. On 28 August 1771 he married Marie-Thérèse de Nény, eldest daughter of Patrice de Nény, chief president of the Privy Council.
By letters patent of 26 December 1773, Fierlant was appointed president of the Great Council, and the following January he was also made a Councillor of State. In 1787, during the reforms of Joseph II, he was transferred to Brussels as head of a new Council of Appeal, but when this project was abandoned he was reinstated as president of the Great Council, retaining the position throughout the political changes of the Brabant Revolution (1788—1793). In 1793, at the second Austrian restoration, he was appointed Chief President of the Privy Council. His career ended with the French invasion of 1794. He died in Brussels on 19 February 1804.

Friant-class cruiser

The "Friant" class comprised three protected cruisers of the French Navy built in the early 1890s; the three ships were , , and . They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the "Friant"-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of six guns supported by four guns and they had a top speed of .
"Friant" and "Chasseloup-Laubaut" initially served with the Northern Squadron, while "Bugeaud" operated in the cruiser force of the Mediterranean Squadron, France's main battle fleet. "Bugeaud" became the flagship of the Levant Division in 1898, which operated as part of the International Squadron that intervened in the Cretan Revolt of 1897–1898. All three members of the class were sent to East Asia in response to the Boxer Uprising in Qing China by 1901, and they remained in the region through the mid-1900s. "Bugeaud" was badly worn out by her time in the Far East, and she was sold for scrap in 1907. That year, "Chasseloup-Laubat" visited the United States during the Jamestown Exposition.
"Chasseloup-Laubat" was reduced to a storage hulk in 1911, but "Friant" remained in active service through the start of World War I in August 1914. She operated with cruiser squadrons patrolling for German commerce raiders early in the war and was later sent to patrol the formerly-German colony of Kamerun. "Chasseloup-Laubat" was converted into a distilling ship to support the main French fleet at Corfu while "Friant" ended the war having been rebuilt into a repair ship. The latter vessel was sold for scrap in 1920, while "Chasseloup-Laubat" ultimately foundered in 1926 after having been abandoned in the bay of Nouadhibou, French Mauritania.
Design.
In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships—the and es—into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a "two-power standard" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies.
The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further demands to strengthen the fleet. The visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy compounded French concerns about a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships.
To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Naval Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The "Friant" class were the first group of protected cruisers to be authorized under the program.
General characteristics and machinery.
The ships of the "Friant" class were long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draft of . They displaced . The ships' hulls featured a pronounced ram bow and a tumblehome shape, which were common characteristics of major French warships of the period. They had a forecastle deck that extended for almost the entire length of the ship, terminating with a short quarterdeck aft and a sloped stern. Their superstructure consisted of a main conning tower with a bridge forward and a smaller, secondary conning tower aft. Each ship was originally to be fitted with a pair of heavy military masts with fighting tops, but stability problems with forced them to be replaced with lighter pole masts carrying only observation positions. Steering was controlled by a single rudder. was fitted with bilge keels to improve her stability. Their crew consisted of 339 officers and enlisted men.
The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twenty coal-burning water-tube boilers of the Niclausse type for "Friant" and the Lagrafel d'Allest type for "Chasseloup-Laubat", while "Bugeaud" received twenty-four Belleville boilers. All of the ships' boiler rooms were ducted into three funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . During sea trials, reached . Coal storage amounted to , which provided a cruising range of at a speed of .
Armament and armor.
The ships were armed with a main battery of six 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual pivot mounts; one was on the forecastle, two were in sponsons abreast the conning tower, another pair were in sponsons just forward of the aft conning tower, and the last was on the stern. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of .
The ships' offensive armament was augmented by a secondary battery of four Modèle 1891 guns, which were carried in pivot mounts in the conning towers, one on each side per tower. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . All of the primary and secondary guns were fitted with gun shields to protect their crews. The offensive weaponry was rounded out by two torpedo tubes that were carried in their hulls above the waterline, one on either side.
For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried a battery of numerous small-caliber, quick-firing guns. This comprised four 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and eleven 1-pounder guns, all in individual mounts. The former were carried in pairs in the forward and aft conning towers on the upper deck; the latter were distributed around the ships, including atop the sponsons for the main guns and higher in the superstructure.
Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat, which increased to on the sloped sides, where it provided a measure of vertical protection. Above the deck at the sides, a cofferdam filled with cellulose was intended to contain flooding from damage below the waterline. Below the main deck, a thin splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments. Their forward conning towers had thick plating on the sides. The gun shields were thick.
Service history.
"Friant" and "Chasseloup-Laubat" spent their first years in service assigned to the Northern Squadron, based in the English Channel. "Bugeaud" was instead assigned to the Mediterranean Squadron, France's primary battle fleet. In both units, the ships were primarily occupied with training exercises. In 1898, "Bugeaud" transferred to serve as the flagship of the Levant Division in the eastern Mediterranean. During that time, she participated in the International Squadron, composed of ships from several of the Great Powers, that intervened in the Cretan Revolt of 1897–1898.
"Bugeaud" was deployed to East Asia by early 1900 in response to the Boxer Uprising, and the other two members of the class had followed her there by 1901, and they remained in the region after the conflict ended. After returning to France in the mid-1900s, "Friant" received new boilers and thereafter returned to fleet operations. Meanwhile, the poor shipyard facilities in the Far East prevented sufficient maintenance being done for "Bugeaud", and she was in a poor state by 1907. Unable to economically repair her, the French Navy struck the ship from the naval register and sold her for scrap. That year, "Chasseloup-Laubat" took part in a visit to the United States for the Jamestown Exposition. She was later hulked in 1911 and disarmed in 1913.
At the start of World War I in August 1914, "Friant" was on station in France's colonies in the Americas. She was initially assigned to a cruiser squadron to patrol the western end of the English Channel. In September, she was moved to French Morocco to join a group of cruisers patrolling for German commerce raiders. At some point after the start of the conflict, "Chasseloup-Laubat" was converted into a distilling ship to support the main French fleet at Corfu. "Friant" was later moved to the Gulf of Guinea to patrol Germany's colony of Kamerun in western Africa. She ended the war having been converted into a repair ship based in Morocco and later at Mudros to support a flotilla of submarines. She was struck from the naval register in 1920 and sold to ship breakers. "Chasseloup-Laubat" was sent to Port Etienne, French Mauritania, to supply the colony with water and eventually sank in 1926 in the bay of Nouadhibou after having been abandoned.

Floating-point error mitigation

Floating-point error mitigation is the minimization of errors caused by the fact that real numbers cannot, in general, be accurately represented in a fixed space. By definition, floating-point error cannot be eliminated, and, at best, can only be managed.
H. M. Sierra noted in his 1956 patent "Floating Decimal Point Arithmetic Control Means for Calculator":
The Z1, developed by Zuse in 1936, was the first computer with floating-point arithmetic and was thus susceptible to floating-point error. Early computers, however, with operation times measured in milliseconds, were incapable of solving large, complex problems and thus were seldom plagued with floating-point error. Today, however, with supercomputer system performance measured in petaflops, (1015) floating-point operations per second, floating-point error is a major concern for computational problem solvers. Further, there are two types of floating-point error, cancellation and rounding. Cancellation occurs when subtracting two similar numbers, and rounding occurs when significant bits cannot be saved and are rounded or truncated. Cancellation error is exponential relative to rounding error.
The following sections describe the strengths and weaknesses of various means of mitigating floating-point error.
Numerical error analysis.
Though not the primary focus of numerical analysis, numerical error analysis exists for the analysis and minimization of floating-point rounding error. Numerical error analysis generally does not account for cancellation error.
Monte Carlo arithmetic.
Error analysis by Monte Carlo arithmetic is accomplished by repeatedly injecting small errors into an algorithm's data values and determining the relative effect on the results.
Extension of precision.
Extension of precision is the use of larger representations of real values than the one initially considered. The IEEE 754 standard defines precision as the number of digits available to represent real numbers. A programming language can include single precision (32 bits), double precision (64 bits), and quadruple precision (128 bits). While extension of precision makes the effects of error less likely or less important, the true accuracy of the results are still unknown.
Variable length arithmetic.
Variable length arithmetic represents numbers as a string of digits of variable length limited only by the memory available. Variable length arithmetic operations are considerably slower than fixed length format floating-point instructions. When high performance is not a requirement, but high precision is, variable length arithmetic can prove useful, though the actual accuracy of the result may not be known.
Use of the error term of a floating-point operation.
The floating-point algorithm known as "TwoSum" or "2Sum", due to Knuth and Møller, and its simpler, but restricted version "FastTwoSum" or "Fast2Sum" (3 operations instead of 6), allow one to get the (exact) error term of a floating-point addition rounded to nearest. One can also obtain the (exact) error term of a floating-point multiplication rounded to nearest in 2 operations with a FMA, or 17 operations if the FMA is not available (with an algorithm due to Dekker). These error terms can be used in algorithms in order to improve the accuracy of the final result, e.g. with floating-point expansions or compensated algorithms.
Operations giving the result of a floating-point addition or multiplication rounded to nearest with its error term (but slightly differing from algorithms mentioned above) have been standardized and recommended in the IEEE 754-2019 standard.
Choice of a different radix.
Changing the radix, in particular from binary to decimal, can help to reduce the error and better control the rounding in some applications, such as financial applications.
Interval arithmetic.
Interval arithmetic is an algorithm for bounding rounding and measurement errors. The algorithm results in two floating-point numbers representing the minimum and maximum limits for the real value represented. "Instead of using a single floating-point number as approximation for the value of a real variable in the mathematical model under investigation, interval arithmetic acknowledges limited precision by associating with the variable
a set of reals as possible values. For ease of storage and computation, these sets are restricted to intervals."The evaluation of interval arithmetic expression may provide a large range of values, and may seriously overestimate the true error boundaries.
Gustafson's unums.
Unums ("Universal Numbers") are an extension of variable length arithmetic proposed by John Gustafson. Unums have variable length fields for the exponent and significand lengths and error information is carried in a single bit, the ubit, representing possible error in the least significant bit of the significand (ULP).
The efficacy of unums is questioned by William Kahan.

Christián Herc

Christián Herc (born 30 September 1998) is a Slovak professional football midfielder. He is currently signed to Grashopper Zürich, where he plays as a midfielder.
Club career.
Loan to DAC 1904 Dunajská Streda.
Herc made his professional Fortuna Liga debut for DAC Dunajská Streda against Senica on 18 February 2018. He came on as a replacement for Zsolt Kalmár in the 83rd minute of the match. DAC won the game 0:2. By the end of the 2017–18 season, Herc made a total of 13 appearances for Dunajská Streda, scoring 3 goals.
He scored his first Fortuna liga goal against Zemplín Michalovce in his second game, on 24 February 2018. He replaced Marko Divković in a 77th minute substitution and scored a stoppage time goal to mark the 2:0 win, after a pass from Lukáš Čmelík. Later on in the championship group, on 22 April, he scored two of three in a 3:2 win over MŠK Žilina at the pod Dubňom. 
Throughout the 2018–19 season, Herc was an important player for Dunajská Streda. He was featured in 29 of 32 league fixtures and scored 3 further goals. He was also featured in all four DAC games in Europa League qualifying rounds, against Dinamo Tbilisi and Dinamo Minsk.
Loan to Viktoria Plzeň.
On 5 June 2019, it was announced that Herc would join Viktoria Plzeň since the following season, on a two-year loan with an option to buy, from Wolverhampton. His move was largely seen as a replacement for Patrik Hrošovský, who was the play-maker at Viktoria for some 7 years, guiding them to three titles as champions and one cup triumph. Although at the time of the announcements of Herc's move Hrošovský's transfer was not definite, it was rumoured that he was to head to Genk.
Loan to Karviná.
On 25 August 2020, having been recalled from his planned two-year stay with Viktoria Plzeň, Herc moved on loan to another Czech side, this time joining Karviná for the 2020–21 season. He completed the season with 6 goals and 31 league appearances.
Grasshopper Zürich.
In the summer of 2021, Herc had signed a two-year contract with Grasshopper Zürich, who had re-gained promotion to Swiss Super League.
International career.
Herc was first recognised as an alternate broader squad member for the senior Slovak national team on 28 September ahead of two 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers against Russia and Croatia.

Walter Jarvis

Walter Edward Howard "Wally" Jarvis (3 July 1895 – 18 February 1985) was a South Australian rower. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight.
Club and state rowing.
Jarvis was employed as a foreman and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Jarvis rowed in the three seat of each of those crews and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923.
International representative rowing.
The South Australian media pushed for Jarvis' victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Jarvis and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Jarvis solid in the three seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Jarvis did not row on after the Olympics.

Mission Bhagiratha

Bhagiratha is a project for safe drinking water for every village and city household in Telangana State, with a budget of ₹43,791 crores. The project is a brainchild of Telangana Chief Minister, K. Chandrashekar Rao, that aims to provide piped water to 2.32 crore people in 20 lakh households in urban and 60 lakhs in rural areas of Telangana. The ambitious project will supply clean drinking water to all households in the state through water sourced from River Godavari (53.68 TMC) and River Krishna (32.43TMC). The bulk supply is expected to be completed by May 2018 and intra-village, intra-locality works will be completed by December 2018.
History.

The inspiration for the project was drawn as few of the habitations relied on contaminated groundwater. In Nalgonda district that is drought-prone, 973 villages with high fluoride content that leads to dreadful disease, fluorosis. 
A similar project, "Maneru Manchineella Pathakam", was conceived and completed by K.C.R, when he was the MLA for Siddipet Assembly Constituency in 1996-97, at a cost of ₹100 crores. The water was sourced from Lower Manair Dam and supplied to all households in 180 villages across Siddipeta constituency. The Chief Minister vowed on the floor of the assembly in 2016 that he will not seek votes in 2019 if the water project is not completed by 2018. The project has been completed successfully and is functional now. It has received accolades from the Central Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat in Rajya Sabha that Telangana is the only state in India providing piped water for every house hold in the state.
The project was launched by the Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi at Komatibanda village, Medak district in Gajwel constituency on 6 August 2016. The other dignitaries were, the Chief Minister of Telangana, K Chandrashekar Rao.

Crawfordsburn Viaduct

The Crawfordsburn Viaduct is a railway viaduct in Crawfordsburn, County Down, Northern Ireland.
Design.
The viaduct is built out of Scrabo sandstone, and carries a double-track railway at a width of 10 metres across a distance of 100 metres. It has five arches and cast-iron lattice parapets. It was designed by Charles Lanyon.
History.
The viaduct was constructed by the Belfast, Holywood &amp; Bangor Railway (BHBR), beginning in 1863, with the foundation stone being laid on October 3rd of that year, and finishing in 1865, with the first passenger train to cross it being on May 18th. The opening of the viaduct was attended by Charles Lanyon, Lord Dufferin, Major Crawford, and BHBR chairman Robert Ward.
It is alleged that some time before BCDR takeover in 1884 that a child fell from the viaduct and was saved only by his clothes catching on a tree.
The viaduct, along with the rest of the Holywood - Bangor line, was upgraded from single to double track between 1897 and 1902, some 13 years after having been taken over by the Belfast and County Down Railway.
The Ulster Transport Authority took over the line in 1948, and with it, the viaduct. It changed hands once again in 1968 becoming the property of Northern Ireland Railways, who removed Lanyon's foundation stone in 1989 on the centenary of his death.
Today.
The viaduct remains in use today, carrying the NI Railways Belfast–Bangor line across Crawfordsburn Glen. Off-peak there are two trains per hour in each direction across the viaduct. It can be seen from Crawfordsburn Country Park, the entrance to which is half an hour's walk from the nearest railway station, Helen's Bay. (Crawfordsburn did have its own railway station at one point but it closed in 1997). It became a listed building in 1975.

Derry Beg

Derry Beg () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Derry Beg is bounded on the west by Corranierna (Corlough) and Derrynaslieve townlands, on the north by Garvary (Corlough) townland and on the east by Derry More and Scrabby, Corlough townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, a stream, spring wells and dug wells. Derry Beg is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 113 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
An 1813 map depicts the townland as "Derrybeg".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list eight tithepayers in the townland. 
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks describe the townland as- "The soil is light yellow clay, intermixed with boulders of sandstone."
The Derry Beg Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 54, being 26 males and 28 females. There were nine houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 44, being 19 males and 25 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seven landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 46, being 20 males and 26 females. There were nine houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are five families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are eight families listed in the townland.

Rap or Go to the League

Rap or Go to the League is the fifth studio album by American rapper 2 Chainz. It was released on March 1, 2019 through Gamebread and Def Jam Recordings. The production on the album was handled by multiple producers, including 9th Wonder, Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E., Mike Dean, Mustard, Pharrell Williams, Terrace Martin, and WondaGurl, among others. LeBron James also served as executive producer. The album features guest appearances by Young Thug, Travis Scott, Kendrick Lamar, Ariana Grande, Ty Dolla Sign, Lil Wayne, Kodak Black and others. 
"Rap or Go to the League" was supported by two singles: "Girl's Best Friend" and "Rule the World". The album received widespread critical praise from music critics and was a commercial success. It debuted at number four on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, earning 65,000 album-equivalent units in its first week.
Background.
In February 2018, 2 Chainz released the EP "The Play Don't Care Who Makes It" and soon after announced that his next album would be titled "Rap or Go to the League".
In February 2019, it was revealed that Los Angeles Lakers small forward LeBron James would executive produce the album. The album cover was later revealed.
A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is "celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship." The press release also says the title "challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player".
On February 28, 2019, the official tracklist was revealed.
Promotion.
In November 2018, the song "Girl's Best Friend", featuring American artist Ty Dolla Sign, was released as a double single with the song "Hot Wings" as "Hot Wings Are a Girl's Best Friend". The music video for "Rule the World" featuring American singer Ariana Grande was released on March 11, 2019, and it then became the album's second single eight days later, on March 19.
Critical reception.
"Rap or Go to the League" received critical acclaim from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received a score of 82, based on 8 reviews. Sheldon Pierce of Pitchfork called the album his most cogent and organized album by far, and his most thoughtful one and stated that "the album is proposed as the rapper’s rejection of the very premise in the title, and in asides and outros he does occasionally question this bifurcation of black liberation, but the music mostly tracks his own path to prosperity through a minefield." He also stated that "As he provides more context for his story than ever, he rewrites the rule book on winning, opening up about his life as certified dealer to rap stars, critiquing the broken collegiate athletics apparatus, and warring against Uncle Sam." Thomas Hobbs of NME gave the album four stars. Hobbs praises 2 Chainz' growth as an artist stating "But even though 2 Chainz has been prolific as a guest rapper, he’s yet to release the kind of classic solo album that will truly solidify his status as a top-tier rapper. This is something he’s hoping to change with ‘Rap Or Go To The League’, a record that suggests that his talent is finally starting to catch up with all his hard work."
Commercial performance.
"Rap or Go to the League" debuted at number four on the US "Billboard" 200 chart, earning 65,000 album-equivalent units (including 13,000 copies as pure album sales) in its first week. This became 2 Chainz' fifth consecutive US top-ten album on the chart. The album also debuted at number one on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming his third album to top the chart. In its second week, the album dropped to number 14 on the chart, earning an additional 26,000 units.

Our Don Bradman

"Our Don Bradman" is a 1930 song by Jack O'Hagan about the legendary Australian cricketer Donald Bradman. It was written just before the 1930 Ashes Test Series between England and Australia, which was held in England that year.
Content.
The song celebrates Donald Bradman as someone who "has won Australia's very highest praise". It lists his achievements and talents, and declares him the person whom "all Australia raves about", more than "Amy Johnson or little Mickey Mouse". The song also mentions other contemporary Australian cricketers, namely Bill Woodfull, Clarrie Grimmett, Bill Ponsford, Alan Kippax "and the rest", but even though the singer acknowledges that they have "gallantly and nobly done their share" Bradman still "tops them all". The lines "How that Mister Lion, poor fish / must just sit and wish and wish / that our Don had never come across the foam" refer to the lion, one of the symbols of English cricket. The lyrics also mention the British cricketers Maurice Tate and Harold Larwood.
Public reception.
The song was recorded with a vocal by Art Leonard and released in July 1930 by Regal. Some of O'Hagan's verses were omitted. On the B-side was another cricket song, "Our Eleven", written by Jack Lumsdaine. The sheet music was released at the same time, just as Bradman scored a triple-century in a Test match in England, and sold 40,000 copies in a few days. A piano roll was also released that month, recorded by Laurel Pardey.
The song quickly became popular and within a few weeks was being performed at community concerts around Australia. When Bradman returned to his home town of Bowral in November 1930 after the triumphant tour of England, the band at the civic reception played "Our Don Bradman".

Walter Pfeiffer (rower)

Waldemar Herbert "Walter" Pfeiffer (15 May 1892 – 11 May 1950), listed by one source as William Pfeiffer, was a South Australian rower. He was a three-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight.
Club and state rowing.
Wally Pfeiffer was a carpenter and his senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight was the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 (with Pfeiffer at stroke) by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Pfeiffer rowed in each of those crews and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920 (at six), 1922 and 1923 (both in the stroke seat).
International representative rowing.
The South Australian media pushed for Pfeiffer's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Pfeiffer and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Pfeiffer in the six seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.
Wally Pfeiffer continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He stroked the South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second).

Agnes Husband

Agnes Husband (20 May 1852 – 30 April 1929) was one of Dundee's first female councillors and was a suffragette. She was awarded Freedom of the City at the age of 74 and has a plaque to her memory in the Dundee City Chambers and a portrait by Alec Grieve is in the McManus Galleries and Museum.
Early life.
Agnes Husband was born in Tayport, the daughter of a shipmaster John Husband and Agnes Lamond or Lomand. Agnes and her sister later worked as dressmakers in the Murraygate, Dundee.
Campaigning for socialism and women's suffrage.
Agnes Husband became involved in her forties in socialism and the Labour party, standing unsuccessfully for election to the School Board in 1897. But in 1901 she was elected as one of the first two women on the Parochial Board. She attended over 80 meetings in a year serving on four committees. And in 1905 Husband did win a place on the School Board too and promoted providing meals, books, and nursery education to poor children in the city. Her own education continued in evening classes at Dundee University College and she became President of the Women's Freedom League (WFL) branch which started up in the city,
She promoted the humanising effect of women who have 'a keener insight, and a more humane ideal into the problem involved' if they only had the 'courage and conviction' also to put themselves forward to serve on key municipal boards. This was at a well attended 1911 ratepayers' meeting in Perth, and a motion by Perth Lord Provost Macnab was carried, to follow Dundee's example, based on what he called Husband's 'most suggestive and sparkling address' and he called upon support from what he dubbed 'the weaker sex, namely the men' - for that city also to encourage more women candidates to their School Board, Town Council and Parish Council elections.
In 1908, Husband introduced suffragette ex-prisoners Anna Munro and Amy Sanderson, whom she knew personally, to a large gathering in the Prince of Wales Halls, in Glasgow to share their prison experiences, when Sanderson said that prison reform was something that women should use their vote for, once it was won. In 1909 Husband had also taken on a national role in the movement for women's suffrage. Agnes Husband attended and was able to give a first hand report on the demonstration which took place at Westminster but this was not reported in the local press.
In 1910, Husband was one of the Scottish delegates to the WFL annual conference and pictured with eight others in "The Vote," WFL's newsletter. In 1912, Husband attended the Seventh Annual Conference of the Women's Freedom League and is pictured greeting WFL President Mrs Despard. Activist Annot Wilkie or Robinson appears to have been influenced by Husband.
Despite a 'severe illness' in September 1913, after appearing alongside Charlotte Despard at an open air event in Hyde Park, London on 24 August 1913, Husband continued her activism. On 9 October 1913, she convened a meeting where Miss Deas expounded 'Bible reading and Votes for Women' showing that 'from the beginning of time fine women had claimed their rights and got them.' And in the same month, under Husband's presidency, the Dundee WFL branch went out to join the local Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) to demonstrate against forcible feeding of suffragettes at Dundee Prison. She was then re-elected as WFL branch president in May 1914, and membership had grown and held local events eliciting sympathetic support at dinner-hour and factory gate talks, including at Invergowrie Paper Mills, and outside the Old Grammar School by WFL Scottish organiser Ada Broughton and others.
In 1926 at the age of 74, she was the 5th woman to be given the Freedom of the City of Dundee.
Husband's Burgess ticket was on display in the City Archives for the centenary of women's suffrage, and it says it was "in recognition of the valuable services rendered by her to the Community as a Member of the Parish Council and the Education Authority and in many other ways over a long period of years".
She died in 1929.
Agnes Husband's influence and link to the wider suffrage movement was described as 
"she worked long and conscientiously on behalf of the poor and for better education. As a member of the suffrage movement, she spoke, wrote and campaigned with gusto. She also supported and encouraged her younger sisters to become involved."
Death and legacy.
In her obituary she was described as 'a pioneer in asserting the claims of women and their competence to participate in the administration of public affairs' and as ' a pioneer in more humane treatment of the poor and in education and care of children.'
She has a blue plaque on the City Chambers, Dundee, and a portrait by Angus Grieve in the McManus Galleries and Museums.
In 2008, Husband was one of the twenty-five women included in the book "'Dundee Women's Trail: Twenty-five footsteps over four centuries"'
In March 2021, the Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Social Security Shirley-Anne Somerville announced that the head office of Social Security Scotland, in one of the controversial new buildings at the waterfront at Dundee will be named 'Agnes Husband House'. As the organisation is responsible for a range or social benefits, Ms Somerville said this is 'in-keeping with Agnes and everything she stood for'. The organisation's chief executive, David Wallace also said: "Miss Husband dedicated so much of her life to helping the poor and oppressed, especially children...and her legacy lives on..those who work here will be proud to follow in her footsteps."

Tom Gill (public servant)

Thomas Gill (23 February 1849 – 21 July 1923) CMG ISO was a public servant in South Australia who served as Under-Treasurer from 1894 to 1920.
History.
Gill was born in Glen Osmond the son of Thomas Gill (March 1816 – 1 January 1903) and Maria Florence Gill ( – 1910) née Selby, and educated at the local school.
In 1865 he joined the Public Service as a junior in the Volunteer Staff (the colony's militia) office. He transferred to the Audit Office, where in 1877 he became chief clerk. In 1878 he was appointed to the Agent-General's Office, London, where he uncovered some valuable information regarding the way interest on the public debt of the colony was paid, resulting in significant savings. In 1881 he transferred to the Treasury; in June 1889 he was appointed Accountant to the Treasury.
He served as secretary to the South Australian delegates to the 1891 Federal Convention, and in 1894 was appointed Under-Treasurer of South Australia, welcomed by the press as a "... smart, reliable, and most deserving public officer", and faithfully served under eight (or nine if V. L. Solomon is counted) Treasurers of various political hues.
He retired in 1920; his replacement was Henry Furneaux Peacock.
Gill and Peter Whitington were in 1922 appointed as a commission to enquire into the public service to identify savings and means of simplifying and improving procedures.
He died in the Adelaide Hospital after being struck by a tram at the corner of Currie and King William streets.

Mabel Leilani Smyth

Mabel Leilani Smyth (September 1, 1892 – March 24, 1936) was a nursing administrator and the first Director of the Public Nursing Service for the Territory of Hawaii. She was of Hawaiian and Irish-English ancestry. Palama Settlement in Kalihi, where she had been the first head nurse of the program, eventually came under her authority at the Public Nursing Service. The Mabel Smyth Memorial Building in Honolulu, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, was erected in her honor.
Early life.
She was raised on a Kona coffee plantation, and grew up in a bilingual household. Her mother, Julia, was of Hawaiian ancestry, and earned a living by making Lauhala hats. She inherited Irish-English ancestry from her father, sea captain Halford Hamill Smyth. Her older twin sisters were Mabel, who died in infancy, and Eva. 
When Mabel Leilani was born, she was given the name of her deceased sister. After Mabel, her sister Julia was born, followed by her brothers: Charles, Harry and Joseph.
Nursing.
Because her sister Eva was visually impaired, Mabel grew up in the role of care-giver. Sometime around the 1907 death of Captain Smyth, Mabel's family moved to Honolulu, where she completed her high school education. Mabel was counseled in her nursing career aspirations by Rev. Albert S. Baker, a medical doctor who was also her church pastor in Kona. He introduced her to James Arthur Rath and Ragna Helsher Rath who ran the health care facilities at Palama Settlement in Kalihi. Upon her graduation, Mabel was engaged as a care-giver for the Rath children on a 1911 trip to Massachusetts. She enrolled in the Springfield, Massachusetts Hospital Training School, returning to Hawaii after her 1915 graduation. Her first nursing assignment was in Kalihi Kae, before spending two years as a temporary director of the Hawaiian Humane Society, at that time an organization that provided care for both humans and animals. She was appointed at the first head nurse at Palama Settlement in 1918.
In 1921, Mabel took a year's sabbatical from her duties at Palama for post-graduate work at Simmons College in Massachusetts. Upon her return, she continued at Palama Settlement until 1927, when she was appointed as the first director of Public Health Nursing, a newly established department under the Hawaii Territorial Board of Health. Prior to this, there had been a separate division under the board for tuberculosis-related issues. Another separate division for maternal and infant hygiene had been headed by Dr. Vivia B. Appleton who left for another appointment. When Mabel was approved by the Board, the two divisions were reorganized as the singular Department of Public Health Nursing. Based on a 1929 recommendation by Dr. Ira V. Hiscock of Yale University, following a two-month field survey of health care in Hawaii, the Palama Settlement was also brought under the Department of Public Health Nursing.
During her career, she maintained memberships in the American Red Cross Nursing Service and the Hawaiian Civic Club. She was trustee of the Territorial Nurses Association and had served as president of the City and County of Honolulu Nurses Association.
Death and legacy.
Mabel died of a post-surgery embolism on March 24, 1936. The year following her death, a $100,000 memorial building was planned, financed through public fundraising. Designed by architect Charles William Dickey, the Mabel Smyth Memorial Building was officially opened January 4, 1941 on the grounds of The Queen's Medical Center in Honolulu. It was listed on the NRHP Oahu on February 3, 1994.

Cossack riots

The Cossack riots were pogroms carried out against the Jews of modern Ukraine during the 1648 uprising of the Cossacks and serfs led by Bogdan Khmelnitsky (or the "Hamil of Evil" as he was called by the Jews) against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Massacre of the Jews of Poland, Belarus, and today's Ukraine occurred throughout the rebellion, which lasted for many years and during the Russo-Polish War (1654-1667) and the small northern war with the Swedish Empire that ignited them. Nevertheless, the sudden destruction of many communities from the beginning of April–May 1648 (Iyar 1848), until the cessation of the Cossacks' progress in November of that year, is the named source. According to the historian Adam Teller: "In the Jewish collective memory, the events in the summer and autumn of 1648 define the uprising in general, and therefore the riots were known as the 1848s." Thousands were slaughtered or died of starvation and epidemics, and many others fled, sold into slavery, or converted. The number of Jews killed by the Cossack rebels in 1648 was estimated at a few thousand to 20,000 at most. It is estimated that all the parties - the Cossacks, the Russians, the Swedes, their allies and the Poles themselves who massacred them on suspicion of collaborating with the invaders - killed between 40,000 and 50,000 Jews in total.
Background.
In 1569, with the establishment of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, large land tracts (of today's Ukraine) were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the rule of the Kingdom of Poland. The aristocracy, which enjoyed independence and even chose the king, controlled the area that had been ruled until then by the Tatars from the Crimea. In the territories western to the Dnieper River, tens of thousands of people from the rest of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth came to settle down. The great Magnates, which most of them were descendants of the local aristocracy, established vast agricultural estates and imposed strict rules on the local Ruthenian peasants.
Among the settlers, there were many Jews. They were pushed from Poland itself under the pressure of city residents who wanted to reduce the economic competition. Many of the Jews were employed by the nobility as leases and estate managers. Dozens of new communities were established in Ukraine, mainly on the right bank (western area) of the Dnieper. The eastern side was a somewhat wild area. It was closer to the Crimea and dangerous to settlement, although some estates and cities were there and drew Jews looking for jobs. Southern to where the river bends, lived the Cossacks from the Zaporozhian Sich, a semi-nomadic society that maintained a routine of constant fighting with the Tatars. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth maintained strained relations with the Cossacks and tried to subordinate them to its authority while exploiting them for military usage.
The nobility mercilessly brutalized the general population and especially the serfs. The economic and social tension, which also led to strong hostility towards Jewish lessees, had gotten worse due to religious reasons. At the end of the 16th century, in the framework of the counter-reformation, the Jesuits have reached the area. Although they intended to fight any manifestation of Protestantism, they soon turned their attention to the Ruthenians, which almost all were Orthodox Christians. Sigismund III Vasa (King Sigismund III) was a devout Catholic, as were most of the Polish nobles. Under these pressures, many of the Ruthenian nobles converted to Catholicism. Similar attempts, which were also expressed in establishing a local Uniate church and the persecution of Orthodox priests who refused to join it, were made towards the common people. The local's rage for all this was quickly channeled into acts of rebellion led by the Cossacks, who were experienced fighters and they rebelled eight times between 1592 and 1638.
In the 19th century, with the creation of Ukrainian nationalism, many historians tried to describe the conflict between a local Ruthenian independence movement and foreign Polish nobility and its Jewish servants. The great Magnates in the region were, in fact, mostly Catholics or Unites, but they were descendants of the original inhabitants, such as the Ostrogski family. The Voivode Jeremi Wiśniowiecki (the Vishnotzky Duke of the book " The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)", in Hebrew: יוֵן מְצוּלָה) was the son of a well-known Orthodox family and converted to Catholicism at the age of 20. There are reports of cooperation between Jews and locals against the nobility and the Jews participation in Cossack raids. Like all the townspeople in the area, the Jews were obliged to participate in defending the towns in case of a siege. In the East Bank, many were obliged to carry the weapon in case of Tartar attacks.
The Events.
The Outbreak of the Uprising.
One of the victims of the landowners was a local junior nobleman named Bogdan Khmelnytsky. In early 1647, his property and his intended fiancé were taken (and according to a single report, his ten-year-old son was murdered) by Daniel Czaplinski, apparently the deputy of the magnate Alexander Koniecpolski. When Bogdan Khmelnytsky turned to the courts and didn't receive any response, a great rebellion began to develop, which was much bigger the previous ones.
In the spring of 1648, Khmelnitsky, who was appointed to be the Ataman (officer) of the Zapurozi, led an army of Cossacks against the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He made an alliance with the Tatars, who provided him with 4,000 cavalry under the command of Tugai Bay. In April he crossed the Dnieper with his army and won two crushing victories against the crown forces, one on the Yellow River on May 15 and the other in Kurson on the 26th.
The news of his victories sparked a huge uprising among the people throughout the country. The Cossacks and the masses massacred the Jews, nobles, Catholics, and Uniates wherever they reached. The disturbances spread to southern of today's Belarus, and the Cossack troops reached Pinsk. The eastern bank of the Dnieper, where the population was almost entirely Orthodox and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence was weak, fell without a real struggle. The following day after the victory in Kurson, on the first day of Shavuot (a Jewish holiday), on May 27, 1648, began a mass deportation of the Jews in the surrounding districts to the fortified cities, desecrating the holiday. About the same time, Yirmi Vishniewiecki withdrew from his estates in Lubny with his own army and took with him several hundred of Jews along with the other refugees. He kept gathering Jewish people on the way.
Nathan Neta Hanover, whose book " "The Abyss of Despair (Yeven Metzulah)" " is the best-known chronicle of events, described what he heard about the riots in the eastern bank that fell into the hands of the rebels:
On the first day of June, Khmelnitsky's main camp was stopped at Bila Sarkawa and ceased moving westward. Yet, the masses in the territories that remained under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth control continued to rebel. Some atamans (officers) Cossack, with the most dominant of them all- Maxim Krivonos, used their forces to support the acts of rebellion. On the tenth of June, 1648, Krivonos conquered the city of Nemyriv, where a large Jewish population had fortified. According to Hanover and other record-writers, he pretended to be a friendly force and flew flags of the Crown Army, while Cossack sources reported from inside. As soon as Nemyriv fell, the Cossacks slaughtered all the Catholics and the Jews inside. Hanover reported 6,000 Jews killed, an improbable number which was denied by modern historians but still provides a measure of destruction. Mordechai Nadav noted that events of the size of that in Pinsk, in which several dozen Jews were apparently killed during the invasion, were more typical of the events. Similar massacres took place in many other cities, such as Polona and Bar. In Nemyriv, the Jewish chronologists noted a mass refusal of Jews to offer the slaughterers to convert to Christianity and to be saved, although at the same time the Shakh (Shabbatai ben Meir HaKohen) wrote that "many Jews violated the covenant." A group of Jews who swore allegiance to the Cossacks and converted to Christianity rescued itself from the city after a short time when Nemyriv fell into the hands of Vishniewitzky.
On June 18, Krivonos began a siege of Tulchyn and broke through the wall on the 21st. The next day the fort fell. Then there was a time-out for several days and on June 26 the massacre took place. Hanover and others argued that the local commander, Duke Janusz Chetvartinsky, betrayed the Jews and gave them to the rioters while trying in vain to save his own life. Israel Halperin determined that there was no evidence of this and Chturtinsky probably tried to release all those who were inside by means of a bribe, but the Cossacks killed them all. He believed that the source of the rumor was because Cheturtinsky belonged to a devout Orthodox family and that is why the Catholics suspected him. Hannover noted that Jews were also offered to convert to Christianity, but they rejected it and chose death for the sanctification of God's Name. The historian Yechezkel Feram rejected Hannover's description and claimed that Hanover based on another person's testimony. Fram believed that the description was a distortion of the story "cliff of the times" about a similar sanction in Hommel that took place at the same time, on the 20th of June, 1648. Meir Meshbreshin reported that several rabbis urged the people to surrender and not to convert, and all of them were slaughtered, but this event is doubted as well.
Others like Hanover tended to link the sanctions of 1848–1988 to the Ashkenazi Kiddush tradition of the Middle Ages, from events such as the 1096 decrees of Blois from 1171. The day Nemyriv was conquered, 10 June 1648, is also the Memorial Day In memory of the victims of the Cossacks. Yet, there were no similar events like mass suicide in the days of the Crusaders in 1650. Historian Jacob Katz tended to associate this to the erosion of the ideal of Kiddush Hashem (the sanctification of God's name through martyrdom) in the past centuries, but Feram wrote that it remained as strong as ever. The difference between the riots was due to external circumstances. Unlike the Crusaders, the rebellious Ruthenians had no organized policy of conversion: they classified anyone who was not Orthodox as an enemy but did not intend to spread their own faith. Also, there are reports of Jews who converted to Christianity voluntarily and still were killed. The Eastern Church had no direct connection with the rioters. For their part, they dealt with looting and killing for their own sake, nobility, Catholics and Uniates as Jews. Paul of Aleppo, who visited the country a few years later, told of a desire for extermination. Even the masses, who were not familiar with the halakhic elements of the hour of annihilation but were well aware of the principle of a long tradition, viewed the events as a politic class struggle rather than an attempt to convert them, as many reports indicate, both from the chronicles and from testimonies to the courts after everything happened.
In September the noble armies suffered a heavy defeat in the Battle of Filabetsi, and in fact, there was no significant force remained until Warsaw itself. Khmelnytsky advanced toward Lviv and Zamość. In Lviv, the city's residents were offered to extradite the Jews in return for lifting the siege, but they refused. As in all other cities, the Jews took part in its defense. At the end of November, fearing a prolonged battle in the winter and after the new Polish-Lithuanian king offered him extensive concessions, Khmelnitsky retreated to Kiev. The fighting resumed at the end of May 1649 and continued intermittently for years to come. Large-scale killings were carried out against the Ukrainian Jews and the parts of Belarus that fell into the hands of the rebels. The number of people who converted to Christianity, which many of them kept their new religion even after the conquest of their homes by the crown's faithful soldiers, was big enough that on the 2nd of May, 1650, King Jan Kazimierz gave a special order that allows all those who wished it to return to Judaism. Many were captured by the Tartars. Among the Jews, it was thought that the Tartars were interested in any Jew in order to sell them in slavery markets. However, they often wanted only slaves who would provide a worthwhile price. These included young women, men of working age and children. There were cases in which the Ruthenian masses rejected the attempts to sell them slaves who were not included among these classifications. It was also reported that the elderly and other non-wanted slaves were separated from the captured prisoners and burned alive so that they would not burden the caravans. However, the Tartars did not take part in the massacres known as Tulchyn and Nemyriv; these were the work of Maksym Kryvonis. The Cossacks themselves did not take slaves but killed those who fell into their hands. The Jewish communities joined forces in the efforts to redeem the Jewish slaves, which were located mainly in the large market in Constantinople. Large donations were made throughout the Jewish world: a special tax was imposed by the Council of Four Lands in areas not affected by the revolt, the Karaites in the Ottoman capital raised donations, and the main help came from a slavery-redeeming company in Venice whose emissaries came as far as Hamburg and Amsterdam to request charity. With these funds and its official delegate, the community of Constantinople redeemed 1,500 people by July 1651, in exchange for a total amount of 150,000 Spanish reais. The stream then decreased and in total there were 2,000 redeemed people in 1648, some in distant markets such as Persia and Algiers.
The number of Jewish victims was evaluated as great. Samuel Ben-Nathan Feidel, in his book from 1650, counted 281 communities destroyed and claimed that six hundred thousand Jews were killed. Shakh on the other hand noted that there were one thousand. Menashe Ben Israel wrote to Oliver Cromwell that there were one hundred and eighty thousand. Although in the 20th century, Isaac Schifer estimated that there were three hundred thousand killed or taken prisoner from 1648 to -1655. Modern research has greatly reduced estimates of the victims of the massacres: Professor Shmuel Ettinger estimated the entire Jewish population of Ukraine in 1648 at -51,325 persons, based on documents from that period. Prof. Shaul Stampfer claimed that there were 40,000, stating that "at most 50% (20,000) and perhaps much less" than those who died at the outbreak of the revolt in 1648.
Additional disputes.
In 1654 Tsardom of Russia gave Suzerainty to Khmelnytsky and their armies invaded together into the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, both in Ukraine and in the north, in Belarus and Lithuania. At the beginning of August 1655, Vilna fell into the hands of the occupier and mass slaughter was carried out, although the reports showed that most of the Jews had managed to escape in time. In October, Lublin was captured, where the chronicles cite about 2,000 Jews who died. It was the greatest disaster of the new battle. The historian Dov Weinryb, based both on Polish records and on personal reports, stated that the correct number was probably several hundred. The Russians also tended to take many prisoners, and a new wave of Jewish slaves reached the markets in 1665 and 1656. Once again, a great effort began to raise funds for their redemption.
In the summer of 1655 invaded a new enemy to the republic, the Swedish Empire led by King Carl Gustav. This war was the most destructive of all the struggles between Poland and Lithuania. It is still estimated to be worse than World War II in terms of the relative damage caused to the country. In what became known as the "Swedish Flood," the most affluent and populated areas of Poland were completely destroyed. The circumstances led to great hunger that year. Jewish reports staged the invaders as sympathetic towards them. Although they did not take special action against them except for a random killing, many Jews, together with the rest of the people, died of starvation, epidemics and sword. For example, the Jewish quarter of Kazimierz in Kraków was completely destroyed by the siege on the city in September–October 1655 and the survivors fled to Bohemia and Moravia.
The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was almost collapsing: Many nobles believed that Karl Gustav would do them good and change sides with their armies. The magnate Janusz Radziwiłł swore allegiance in return for protection from the Russians and cut off Lithuania from the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. But the scales were tipped by the massacres and looting of the Swedes, and especially by the awakening of Catholic sentiment with the successful defense of the Jasna Góra Monastery of Częstochowa since November. The Piłsudski (a family of nobility that originated in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and increased in notability under the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and the Second Polish Republic) began to resent the Swedish king, who neglected their affairs, and most of them renewed their loyalty to Jan Kazimierz. The masses of the people and the minor nobility, headed by Hetman Stefan Czerniecki, launched a guerilla war against the Lutheran conquerors. In the fall of 1656, the Czar estimated that Sweden might become too strong and started supporting the King of Poland.
The rebels, driven also by the betrayal of the Calvinist Radziwiłł, ran what they perceived as a struggle for the Catholic Church. Lutherans, Calvinists, neo-Aryans, Orthodox and Jews were all marked as enemies and suspected of collaborating with the Swedes. Different militias and the Crown Forces massacred them frequently. On January 22, 1656, the king confiscated the remains of Kazimierz and gave all the looting that could be extracted from it to the army after declaring that the Jews had cooperated with the enemy. In February 1656, Czerniecki killed 600 Jews, according to the records, when he liberated Sandomierz Castle. Poland, Lithuania and Sweden signed a peace agreement in 1660, and the fighting between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Moscow resumed. It continued on a relatively limited scale until signing the Truce of Andrusovo Agreement in 1667, which brought tranquility to the kingdom for the first time in 19 years. The Lithuanian communities paid a large sum to include in the contract a clause allowing all Jewish prisoners in Russia, with the exception of converts and women who were married, to return home.
The historian Dov Weinryb wrote that according to records about the size of Jewish communities in the 1970s and 1980s, which together with other data indicate that many survived by conversion or immigration, "a reasonable estimate" of all Jews killed - By the sword, by all sides, and by epidemics and famine - during the turbulent period that swept Poland from 1648 to 1677, "will be between 40,000 and 50,000, although historians point to far larger estimates, which are high enough to include between a fifth and a quarter of the Jewish population In Poland and Lithuania on the eve of the uprising.

Following the Sanctions.
The chaos that was in Poland following the sanctions brought the leaders of the communities and their rabbis into taking steps regarding the welfare of the refugees, both in material aid and in halachic discussions to allow a second marriage to women whose husbands had been lost. The problem of women whose husbands had been lost reached distant courts in communities where captives were redeemed and wanted to remarry. In Cairo, in a case cited in the "Divrei Noam", a group of women sent a messenger to Poland who returned with divorce documents from all their husbands.
The generation who lived at that time debated the question of whether the sanctions were shedding clean blood for the sins of the House of Israel or punishment from god. Many adopted the first statement, but pamphlets published in Europe blamed the Polish Jewry of committing sins such as loan interest, Folk distribution of Kabbalah books to the masses, raising pigs for non-Jews, lawlessness and more. The massive flight to the west also led to the renewed growth of the Holy Roman Empire as an important Torah center, after years of standing in the shadow of its neighbor to the east. Researchers in the past have frequently related the pogroms as a catalyst for the rise of Sabbateanism. Sarah, the wife of Shabtai Zvi, also became orphaned during it. Although this assertion lost its validity over time, Israel Halpern believed that the effort to raise funds for the redemption of captives throughout the continent hastened the horrific news of the events to the entire Diaspora and played an important role.
In memory of the heavy mourning, the rabbis decreed banquets and fancy costumes. Wearing silk and velvet was forbidden for three years. Women were forbidden to wear gold chains and gems for three years. It was forbidden to sing songs of joy for one year, except for wedding ceremonies, and the authority was given by the leaders of each community to extend the validity of the prohibitions for additional years.
In February 1650 The Council of Four Lands assembled in Lublin, where it was declared that the Memorial Day for the sanctions in Blois and for the day that nemyriv fell will be on the 10th of June, 1648 (20th of Sivan- a month from the Jewish calendar) In memory of the victims. Lamentations and special prayers were written to be said on this day. Rabbi Yom Tov Lipman Heller then corrected the lament of "Ella Ezekara in Third Tears" for those who perished. In addition, various versions of the prayer "El Malei Rachamim" (Jewish prayer for the soul of a person who has died, usually recited at the graveside during the burial service and at memorial services during the year) were also composed, to be recited on the 20th of Sivan, on Yom Kippur, on the Sabbath preceding Shavuot and on Shabbat Chazon.
Despite its many inaccuracies, "Abyss of Despair" has become a historical memory because of the high quality of Hanover's writing. It was published in more than twenty editions in several languages and remained a major source until the 20th century. The sanctions of 1648 are mentioned in several literary works in Hebrew. The most famous of them are: "The Slave" by Isaac Bashevis Singer, "The Nazarene" by Shalom Asch, "A City In Its Fullness" by SY Agnon and the Ballad "the Rabbi's daughter" by Shaul Tchernichovsky.

His first posting was to 39 (Beaufort) Squadron, flying torpedo bomber sorties against enemy shipping in the Mediterranean Theatre. From 39 Squadron Bullen then moved to 458 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force operating Wellington Bombers.
George Medal.
It was while serving with 458 Squadron that Bullen carried out the action for which he was awarded the George Medal in the spring of 1944. Returning from an operation over Italy, Bullen's aircraft suffered an engine failure as it approached its home airfield and crashed. He was thrown clear, receiving severe injuries to his arms, back and legs. In spite of this he made his way into the burning wreckage and rescued the wireless operator. Bullen received burns in addition to his other injuries.
Later service.
Once recovered from his injuries, Bullen was certified as unfit for active service. He was reassigned to administrative duties and rose through the ranks. His rise took him to the post of Adjutant-General HQ Allied Air Forces Central Europe between 1965 and 1968.

Ragonia gens

The gens Ragonia was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens are first mentioned in the early decades of the Empire, but they did not become prominent until the time of Commodus, in the late second century, from which period several of them attained positions of high distinction in the Roman state.
Origin.
The nomen "Ragonius" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix , typically of plebeian origin, and frequently of Oscan ancestry. Such names were originally formed from cognomina ending in "-o", but once they became common, came to be regarded as a regular gentile-forming suffix, and was used in cases where it had no morphological justification.
The origin of "Ragonius" is obscure, but Chase suggests a possible etymological relationship to "raga", a variation of "braca", a harness, or, in the plural, breeches. The occurrence of the Etruscan gentilicia "Urinatius" and "Larcius", and the Latin "Tuscenius" in the nomenclature of two of the earlier Ragonii might point to an Etruscan origin, but given the period at which they appear, in all probability they refer to ancestors of this family in the female line.
Branches and cognomina.
The Ragonii used a variety of common surnames, including "Celer", swift, "Celsus", tall, "Clarus", bright or famous, and "Priscus", elder. The only distinct family of this gens passed down the surnames "Quintianus" and "Venustus" for several generations; "Quintianus" was probably an old agnomen, originally belonging to someone who was adopted out of the gens Quinctia, while "Venustus", which entered the family through the female line, was applied to someone charming or attractive.

Hans Amtmann

Hans H. Amtmann (1906–2007) was a German aircraft designer.
He is best known for his work at Blohm &amp; Voss, where he worked as Head of New Projects under Chief Designer Richard Vogt during the World War II era. After the war, he moved the United States as part of Operation Paperclip, where he worked on a variety of projects.
Early years.
Hans Amtmann was born in Sande, on the outskirts of Bergedorf, near Hamburg in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, in October 1906. He was the second of two brothers. From the age of nine he was educated at the Hansa School. During this time he learned to play the violin, before moving on to study naval architecture at the State Technical College in Hamburg. In his final term he took a course in aeronautics.
German aeroplane designer.
After only one month working as a naval architect, Amtmann was offered a position as an aircraft designer at Junkers in Dessau. He worked on the wings of the G 38 and Ju 52 all-metal transports, and on in-flight refuelling, rocket-assisted take-off and preliminary design work. There he also met Hermann Pohlmann, who would go on to design the famous Ju 87 "Stuka" or dive-bomber before eventually becoming Amtmann's superior in another company.
In 1933 Amtmann moved to Heinkel at Warnemünde on the shores of the Baltic sea, where he worked on the fuselage of the He 70 transport before becoming involved once again on new project work.
Wanting to return to Hamburg, Amtmann obtained a position as an aircraft designer at the newly established Hamburger Flugzeugbau, under the design leadership of Richard Vogt. He started work there as one of Vogt's first recruits, early in 1934, and was soon appointed Head of Preliminary Design. He would remain there, working on Vogt's great range of unconventional and ingenious ideas, throughout its official renaming as a subsidiary of Blohm &amp; Voss shipbuilders, until it was shut down at the end of World War II in 1945. Due to the workload on Vogt, Amtmann's old colleague Pohlmann would later also join B&amp;V as Deputy Chief Designer, so becoming his immediate superior.
He married Margret, whom he had known since his days as a naval architect, on 10 October 1934. They had four children; three boys and a girl.
In 1941 he was awarded the War Merit Cross for his outstanding aircraft work.
Amtmann was subsequently appointed project engineer for the proposed Blohm &amp; Voss BV 237 "stuka" or dive-bomber attack aircraft, which had been personally approved by Hitler, but the order was obstructed by others and the work delayed until the war ended. He also took over and led the design of the P 200 transatlantic passenger flying boat project for Deutsche Luft Hansa, with the intention of building it when the war was over. The BV 40 interceptor glider, flown in prototype form, gave him experience of the prone pilot position, which would help his later career.
Immediately after the factory was shut down at the end of hostilities, B&amp;V kept a core design team together in rented rooms at a museum. But money soon ran out and Amtmann took a teaching job.
American "paperclip".
In October 1946 Amtmann left his teaching job, having been recruited under the American Operation Paperclip to work in the US. Vogt would also be recruited, but Pohlmann would stay behind and later help to resurrect the Hamburger Flugzeugbau. Amtmann was sent to Wright Field, where he resumed work on a prone pilot bed, working for the biomedical facility under H. T. E. "Ed" Hertzberg. Amtmann developed a patent control system for the pilot and the bed was test flown in a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress bomber and later in a Lockheed F-80E Shooting Star jet fighter. During this work he also developed a protective shield for the pilot's helmet during emergency ejection which was widely adopted. Another invention was a flying fuel tank system in which the fuel tank glider was attached to the wing tips in parasite configuration. By a coincidence his erstwhile Chief, Richard Vogt, was also at Wright Field and came up with the same idea, beating Amtmann to the patent office.
His family were eventually allowed to come over from Germany and join him early in 1948, but he did not become a legal immigrant until 1 January 1949. The filing of immigration paperwork had to be carried out at a border crossing, so the "Operation Paperclip" migrants were taken in batches, under military escort, across the Canadian border at Niagara Falls and then walked back over the bridge into the US, where they signed their immigration papers. He signed US citizenship papers in March. He escorted the rest of his family on the same exercise several months later and they received their papers in 1950.
Amtmann left US Government employment in 1951, to work for Consolidated Vultee in San Diego, California, in his old role of preliminary design. He worked on the Atlas ICBM system. Following a company separation of aero and missile divisions, under the new company name of Convair he developed the P6Y flying boat for the US Navy, but they withdrew the requirement. He was also involved in the Convair series of supersonic delta-winged jets, proposing his own design for a four-engined seaplane similar to, but larger than, the Convair F2Y Sea Dart.
Made redundant in 1961, he joined General Atomic and worked on the Orion space propulsion system, which proposed using a controlled sequence of nuclear explosions to propel the spacecraft. He also worked on atomic-powered gas turbines.
He moved to a small company working on nuclear fusion power in 1980, until the company closed in 1984.
Retirement and death.
Amtmann retired in 1984, following closure of the nuclear fusion company.
During his time in California he had joined a small orchestra in which he once again played the violin.
He wrote up his memoirs which were published in 1988 as "The Vanishing Paperclips: America's Aerospace Secret – a Personal Account".
He appeared in the 1995 TV film documentary "The Last Days of World War II"
Hans Amtmann died at the age of 100, on 20 February 2007.

Heli Lääts

Heli Lääts (24 June 1932 – 16 February 2018) was an Estonian singer (mezzo-soprano) whose career began in the mid-1950s. Lääts predominantly performed estrada, chamber, pop, polka, and jazz music.
Early life and education.
Heli Lääts was born in Kuressaare, on the island of Saaremaa to Vladimir and Julia Lääts ("née" Allik). She was the youngest of three children and only girl. Her eldest brother was chemist (1928–2008) and her other brother was physicist Valdur Lääts (1929–2002). She spent her early years in the village of Sauvere. Following the German occupation of Estonia during World War II, Lääts' mother, a schoolteacher, was executed by German soldiers by gunshot on 18 November 1941 in a reprisal killing of villagers for the assassination of a German military officer. After the death of her mother, she was raised by her aunt Anna. Her father later remarried.
Lääts later attended primary and secondary schools in Kivimäe and Rahumäe. In 1950, while contemplating attending the University of Tartu to study physical education, she was singing in a mixed-choir under the direction of Joosep Aavik. The choir traveled to Tallinn for the XIII Estonian Song Festival and Aavik introduced Lääts to singer , who, after hearing Lääts sing, asked her why she didn't wish to train as a singer. After a year of student teaching in Kuressaare, she changed her plans and enrolled at the Tallinn State Conservatory (now, the Estonian Academy of Music and Theatre) in Tallinn, graduating in 1955. Her first year at the Conservatory, she was under the direction of singer Georg Ots.
In 1960, Lääts graduated with a degree in singing from the Conservatory, having studied under . She was the first Estonian singer to receive a qualification in estrada and chamber singing.
Career.
In 1956, Lääts began to perform as an estrada singer with the Emil Laansoo Ensemble and the Eesti Raadio Estrada Orchestra. Estrada, during the Soviet period, usually referred to performers of traditional popular music (although the actual term Estrada (stage) is much wider). Estrada music was generally written by professional composers and poets. The songs were designed for vocal prowess, had clear, catchy melodies, and accompaniment is given to a secondary role.
In 1957, Lääts joined many other estrada performers and the ensemble Metronoom to participate in the World Festival of Youth and Students in Moscow. In 1958, Lääts was the first Estonian singer to win a title in a Soviet Union-wide estrada contest.
From 1957 until 1961, Lääts sang in the Eesti Raadio Women's Trio, and from 1957 until 1987, she performed as a soloist with the Estonian SSR State Philharmonic (now, the Estonian National Symphony Orchestra). From 1966 until 1974, she was employed as a vocal teacher at the Philharmonic's estrada studio.
During her career, Lääts also recorded and performed a number of children's songs. She also released several albums, recorded music for Eesti Raadio and recorded songs with Mikk Mikiver, Uno Loop, and Jaak Joala. Some of her best-known songs in Estonia include "Tsirkus," "Kaunid baleriinid," "Oma laulu ei leia ma üles," "Kevad ja päike," and "Tänav, pink ja puu."
Personal life and death.
Heli Lääts was married to conductor and pianist for fifty-six years. Prior to their marriage in Kadrina in 1958, they had been in a relationship for two years. Saul died in 2014. The couple had two sons, Indrek and Kaarel. Lääts died of natural causes at age 85 on 16 February 2018 in Tallinn. She was buried in Tallinn's Metsakalmistu cemetery.
Awards and recognition.
Lääts was awarded the title of Merited Artist of the Estonian SSR in 1970 and People's Artist of the Estonian SSR in 1976. In 2004, she was awarded the Order of the White Star, V Class. That same year, she won one of four Estonian National Culture Foundation Lifetime Achievement Awards.

Crumlin Viaduct (Northern Ireland)

The Crumlin Viaduct is a railway bridge in Crumlin, County Antrim. It has the distinction of being the only place in Ireland where a train, plane, car, and boat can theoretically cross paths, due to its unique status of being a railway bridge straddling a road bridge across a river, with Belfast International Airport two kilometers to the north.
History.
The railway line through Crumlin opened in 1871, crossing the Crumlin River by means of a simple lattice girder bridge. This was replaced in 1915 with the current structure, a Pratt truss. The original was reused at Adelaide railway station in Belfast. The current viaduct was designed and built by James Findlay &amp; Co. of Motherwell, Scotland.
Passenger traffic ceased in 1960.
The bridge was reinforced in the early 1970s to prepare for the reintroduction of passenger traffic, in 1974. It then carried trains between Derry, Antrim, Lisburn and Belfast until 2003, when the passenger service ceased once again.

The viaduct, along with the rest of the Lisburn - Antrim line, has lain mothballed since 2003, though both are maintained to an operational level and used for engineering trains, driver training, and diversionary passenger services when the line between Belfast and Antrim via Whiteabbey is closed.

Baghdad College of Fine Arts

The Baghdad College of Fine Arts (now the Institute of Fine Arts) is a faculty of the University of Baghdad.
Background.
Until the early 20th-century there was little development in the visual arts. However, in the 1930s and 40s, a group of talented local artists was sent to study in Europe by the Ministry of Culture. On their return, these artists introduced modern styles such as impressionism to the local scene. They shared their experiences and knowledge of art by opening studios, providing art tuition, organising artists' collectives and exhibitions. Most of these artists taught in the modern style. They also consciously searched for a visual language that would integrate contemporary abstract art with Iraqi traditions and themes. These artists formed the nucleus of the group that founded the College of Fine Arts and became its first Faculty members. 
Origins.
Its origins can be traced back to the Baghdad Conservatory founded in 1936. In 1940 the range of subjects studied was expanded to include acting, directing, painting and sculpture. In the same year, the name was changed to the Institute of Fine Arts. Then in 1958 it became the Academy of Fine Arts and premises were found in Bab Al-Moatham near the Medical City Teaching Hospital. There was an expansion of courses available with a Department of Film and Theatre, and Department of Paining and Sculpture.

Book Law

Book Law (1924 – 1944) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. The best female racehorse of her generation in Britain, she was noted for her courage and consistency and in her prime she was described as a "fighting machine".
She showed great promise as a two-year-old in 1926 when she won the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot. In the following year she finished second in both the 1000 Guineas and the Oaks Stakes, before embarking on a six-race winning streak which included the Coronation Stakes, Nassau Stakes, St Leger and Jockey Club Stakes. As a four-year-old in 1928 she won the Burwell Stakes on her seasonal debut but then finished third in both the Coronation Cup and the Eclipse Stakes after which she was retired from racing to become a broodmare.
Her foals included the top class colts Rhodes Scholar and Canon Law, the influential broodmare Highway Code and Archive, a racehorse of no account who sired Arkle.
Background.
Book Law was a bay mare bred in the United Kingdom by her owner Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor. She was sent into training with Alec Taylor, Jr. at his stable at Manton, Wiltshire.
She was sired by Buchan, who won the Eclipse Stakes, Champion Stakes and Doncaster Cup as well as finishing second in the 2000 Guineas and the Epsom Derby. As a breeding stallion he made his mark as a sire of fillies including Short Story and the dams of Airborne and Sun Castle. Her dam Popingaol won two minor races but became a very successful broodmare whose other foals included Pogrom, Splendid Jay (Yorkshire Oaks), Book Debt (dam of Pay Up) and Fair Cop (female-line ancestor of Provoke).
Racing career.
1926: two-year-old season.
Book Law made her first impact in June 1926 when she contested the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in which she was ridden by Robert A "Bobby" Jones and won at odds of 7/2. At Sandown Park in July she ran unplaced behind Pricilla in the National Breeders' Produce Stakes. In autumn she finished third to Applecross in the Moulton Stakes at Newmarket.
Towards the end of the year she was described as the best horse of her age and sex in England.
1927: three-year-old season.
In a twenty-eight runner field for the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 29 April, Book Law dead-heated for second place with Endowment, two lengths behind the winner Cresta Run. On 3 of June Book Law started the 5/2 favourite Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. She took the lead approaching the final turn but was overtaken in the closing stages and beaten a head by Beam in a "terrific race". Book Law was then dropped back in distance for the Coronation Stakes over one mile, which, with a first prize of £4,750, was the most valuable run that year at Royal Ascot. Ridden by Henri Jellis she started the 4/9 favourite and won from Lord Furness's Gay Baby. The filly maintained her good form through the summer of 1927, taking the Welsh Oaks at Chepstow and the Gratwicke Stakes at Goodwood before winning the Nassau Stakes (again at Goodwood) at odds of 2/5.
On 7 September, with Jellis in the saddle, Book Law started the 7/4 favourite in a field of sixteen colts and fillies for the 152nd running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs at Doncaster Racecourse. The race had been deprived of some interest by the absence of the Derby winner Call Boy, whose entry had been rendered void by the death of his owner. Racing on heavy ground Book Law was always in close contention before going to the front early in the straight. She repelled a challenge from the Derby runner-up Hot Night and drew away to win by three lengths with five lengths back to Son and Heir in third place.
Three weeks after her Leger success, Book Law ended her second season with a run in the jockey Club Stakes over fourteen furlongs at Newmaarket in which she was matched against older horses. Starting at odds of 4/6, she won by three quarters of a length from the four-year-old Foliation. By the end of 1927 she was being described as the best three-year-old in England of either sex. He earnings of £22,316 made her easily the most financially successful horse of the year.
When Alec Taylor the Manton stable was taken over by his assistant Joseph Lawson
1928: four-year-old season.
Book Law began her second season by winning the Burwell Stakes over one and a half miles at Newmarket in May. At Epsom in June she started favourite for the Coronation Cup but began to struggle soon after half way and finished third behind the Italian-bred five-year-old Apelle. Both Lord Astor and Henri Jellis were bitterly disappointed by her performance, but it was subsequently found that she had been suffering from a "kidney infection". The filly missed an intended run in the Ascot Gold Cup but returned on 20 July for the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown and finished third to Fairway and Royal Minstrel.
Book Law's retirement was announced shortly after her defeat at Sandown. She ended her career with earnings of £31,875, making her the fourth most successful female racehorse in British turf history up to that time behind Sceptre (£38,283), Pretty Polly (£36,638) and La Fleche (£34,703).
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Book Law an "average" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Book Law was retired from racing to become a broodmare for Lord Astor's stud. Book Law died in November 1944 in a paddock accident at the Cliveden Stud. She produced at least ten foals between 1930 and 1944:

Erika von Mutius

Erika von Mutius (born 14 May 1957 in Bonn, Germany) is a German pediatrician and allergologist at the Helmholtz Center Munich and the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich. Her research interests include paediatrics, pediatric pneumology, allergology and epidemiology.
Life.
Her parents were Franz von Mutius and Hanna Elisabeth von Mutius, born Gazert. Her mother came from a Partenkirchen-based medical family of North German origin. Her maternal grandfather was the German expedition physician and medical officer Hans Gazert; his father, Medical Council Ludolph Friedrich Gazert, originated from a Luneburger merchant family.
Career.
Erika von Mutius studied Medicine from 1976 to 1984 at the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich. From 1984 to 1992 she was trained as a specialist in pediatrics at the Dr. von Hauner Children's Hospital of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich with all general pediatric wards, the neonatal intensive care unit, the pediatric intensive care unit and the pediatric surgical ambulance. In July 1992 she passed the pediatric exam.
She was senior physician at the Haunersches Children's Hospital and habilitated in 1998. Since 2000, she has been Head of the Allergy and Asthma Department of the Hospital. In 2004 she was appointed Professor of Pediatrics at the University of Munich. 
Since 2017, she has been the Director of the new Institute for Asthma and Allergy Prevention (IAP) at Helmholtz Center Munich.
Research.
Erika von Mutius received the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize in 2013 for her basic insights into the causes of childhood lung diseases – in particular epidemiological studies on allergic asthma.
She is one of the first allergy researchers who found out after the fall of the german wall in 1989/90 that in the GDR, despite the poorer environmental conditions caused by the air pollution, proportionately only half as many allergies existed as in the Federal Republic of Germany. After the reunification, the same level in both parts of the country was reached within a few years. Erika von Mutius suspected that the children had more contact with other children through their daycare in kindergarten. She stated in comparative studies that despite higher air pollution in Leipzig compared to Munich, the risk of asthma in children was not higher. She also found that children who grow up in the countryside and who are in contact with animals have a lower risk of allergies.
Awards.
In 2013, von Mutius was awarded the Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize for "fundamental discoveries related to the formation and treatment of lung disease in children".
Editorships.
Erika von Mutius is a member of the Editorial Board of the New England Journal of Medicine and editor of the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology and the European Respiratory Journal.

Trae Williams (sprinter)

Trae Williams (born 5 May 1997) is an Australian track and field sprinter. Williams is the 2018 Australian men's 100-metre athletic champion, having been the runner-up and first-placed Australian in 2017. He is the fifth-fastest Australian of all time with a personal best time of 10.10 seconds achieved on 16 February 2018, after Patrick Johnson (9.93 in 2003), Matt Shirvington (10.03 in 1998), and Josh Ross (10.08 in 2007) and Rohan Browning (10.08 in 2018).
Williams made the shock decision in August, 2020 to switch from athletics to rugby sevens. This was a gamble as it was uncertain whether he would make the Australian Rugby Sevens 2020 Olympics team. Unfortunately, he was not part of the squad that went to Tokyo.
Away from the track Williams is a keen reader, listing Hemingway, Austen and Dickens amongst his favourite authors. He is currently working on a critical literary analysis of Chris Kyle's 'American Sniper'(sic).

March for Our Lives

March for Our Lives (MFOL) was a student-led demonstration in support of gun control legislation. It took place in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018, with over 880 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world, and was planned by Never Again MSD in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting a month earlier, which was described by several media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.
Protesters urged for universal background checks on all gun sales, raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to 21, closing of the gun show loophole, a restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines and bump stocks in the United States. Turnout was estimated to be between 1.2 and 2 million people in the United States, making it one of the largest protests in American history.
Planning.
Following the school shooting at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on February 14, Cameron Kasky, a junior at the school, and his classmates, announced the march four days later. Also joining the march efforts are Alex Wind of Stoneman Douglas High School, who along with four friends created the "Never Again" campaign. X González and David Hogg, also survivors of the shooting, have been vocal supporters of the march.
The date was chosen in order to give students, families and others a chance to mourn first, and then on March 24, talk about gun control. Organizers filed a permit application with the National Park Service during the week of February 23, and expected as many as 500,000 people to attend. However, the National Mall, which was the planned site of the main march in Washington, D.C., was reportedly already booked for March 24; the application, filed by an unidentified local student group, claimed it was for a talent show. A permit was later obtained for Pennsylvania Avenue. The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority announced it would operate extra trains for the march.
The Enough! National School Walkout was held on the one month anniversary of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. It involved students walking out from their classes for exactly 17 minutes (one for each of the victims of the massacre) and involved more than 3,000 schools across the United States and nearly one million students. Thousands of students also gathered and staged a rally in Washington, D.C., after observing 17 minutes of silence with their backs to the White House. After the success of the walkout, Hogg posted a tweet that included a provocative, NRA-style advertisement calling out lawmakers for their inaction on or opposition to gun control efforts, asking "What if our politicians weren't the bitch of the NRA?", and ending with a promotion for the upcoming March.
Celebrity and corporate support.
George Clooney and Scooter Braun were major forces behind the organization of the march, and aided in fundraising efforts behind the scenes. Amal and George Clooney donated $500,000 to support the march and announced they would attend. Oprah Winfrey matched the Clooney donation to support the march. Jeffrey Katzenberg and his wife Marilyn also contributed $500,000. Film director and producer Steven Spielberg and actress Kate Capshaw Spielberg donated $500,000, also matching the donation of the Clooneys. On February 23, Gucci announced they were also donating $500,000 towards the march. Other people and organizations offering support have included Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber, Gabby Giffords, Lauren Jauregui, Alyssa Milano, Moms Demand Action, Amy Schumer, St. Vincent, Harry Styles, Hayley Williams, Paul McCartney, Kanye West, and Kim Kardashian. John Legend and Chrissy Teigen donated $25,000. Jimmy Fallon pledged to attend an event with his family. Samantha Bee interviewed kids. Jim Jefferies interviewed participants in San Diego. Other celebrities including Taylor Swift have donated an undisclosed amount of money toward the campaign. Justin Timberlake, Will Smith, Cher and Amy Poehler also participated in the march.
James Corden promoted the March for Our Lives event. John Zimmer and Logan Green, the co-founders of Lyft, announced their support of the rallies and stated that their company would provide free rides for those attending demonstrations. Dating app Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd subsequently announced that they were supporting the NeverAgain movement by banning all images of firearms on their dating application.
John Cena and Millie Bobby Brown applauded the March for Our Lives event at the Kids Choice Awards.
The founding members of MFOL were awarded "Smithsonian" magazine's 2018 American Ingenuity Award in the Youth category.
In Washington, D.C., a prayer and vigil was held at the Washington National Cathedral on the eve of the rally, as a memorial for the victims of gun violence, and to declare the church's belief, "This work is rooted in our commitment to Jesus' command to love our neighbors as ourselves... We gather out of a conviction that the right to bear arms does not trump the right to life."
The litany also included the following refrain:
Guest speakers included Philip and April Schentrup, parents of 16-year-old Carmen Schentrup, who was killed in the shooting in Parkland, Florida.
Participation.
March for Our Lives was among the biggest youth-led protests since the Vietnam War era. Estimates of participation at the main event in Washington, D.C., range from 200,000 to 800,000.
The speakers—all of whom were high schoolers or younger—included Marjory Stoneman Douglas students Cameron Kasky, David Hogg, Delaney Tarr, Sarah Chadwick, Alex Wind, Jaclyn Corin, Ryan Deitsch, Aalayah Eastmond, Samantha Fuentes, and X González. Hunter Pollack, brother of victim Meadow, was scheduled to speak, but did not attend due to a logistical issue, which he contended was a result of being misled by event officials. David Hogg tweeted out a video of Hunter's speech from a later event.
Other participants included Naomi Wadler, who is an elementary school student in Alexandria, Virginia, Trevon Bosley from Chicago whose brother was shot and killed leaving church, Edna Lizbeth Chávez, a high school student from Los Angeles, and Zion Kelly, whose twin brother was shot and killed during an armed robbery. Yolanda Renee King, granddaughter of Martin Luther King Jr., also made an appearance along with Mya Middleton, a student from Chicago representing After School Matters, Matt Post, a senior from Montgomery County, Christopher Underwood, an 11-year old from New York, Alex King and D'Angelo McDade from Chicago, and Matthew Soto, brother of Sandy Hook victim Victoria Soto, and Parkland parents Lori Alhadeff, who lost her daughter Alyssa in the school incident and Manuel &amp; Patricia Oliver, whose lost their son Joaquin and launched a campaign titled "Change The Ref" to honor their son and push for new restrictions on any form of weapon violence.
González, after speaking and naming the seventeen victims, stood silent for over four minutes, after which a cellphone alarm went off and she announced that it was the six minute and twenty second point in her speech, equal to the length of the Parkland shooting. González ended her speech saying,
then walked off stage as the entire crowd along Pennsylvania Avenue applauded loudly. Her speech and emotional moment of silence was praised by media organizations as one of the "most memorable" and "powerful" moments in the day's events.
Singers Ariana Grande, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ben Platt, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson, Andra Day, Common, Selena Gomez, Demi Lovato and Vic Mensa joined student-led marchers in Washington, D.C.

Responses.
National Rifle Association.
On March 21, NRATV host Grant Stinchfield stated that "March for Our Lives is backed by radicals with a history of violent threats, language and actions"; fact-checker PolitiFact has rated this statement as being "without merit" and "Pants on Fire" indicating that it is a "ridiculous claim".
While the march was occurring, the NRA posted a membership drive video on their Facebook page, declaring that the "protests aren't spontaneous. Gun-hating billionaires and Hollywood elites are manipulating and exploiting children as part of their plan to DESTROY the Second Amendment". Another video dubbed "A March for Their Lies" was uploaded to YouTube featuring Colion Noir, in which he described the planned rally as a "carnival of a march". Noir also said in the video that there is an "agenda that's a million times bigger than the guns".
Politicians.
"The Washington Post" reported that there were many Democrats encouraging the marchers, and many of them, including candidates for office, participated from the sidelines in the march, but few Republicans did similarly. The White House said in a response that they "applaud the many courageous young Americans exercising their first amendment rights".
On the day of the protests, Florida Republican senator Marco Rubio responded by stating: "However, many other Americans do not support a gun ban" and "view banning guns as an infringement on the Second Amendment rights of law abiding citizens that ultimately will not prevent these tragedies". He called for protesters to find "common ground with those who hold opposing views" for change to happen. However, a blanket gun ban was not called for by the protests.
Former Republican senator and presidential candidate Rick Santorum criticized the Parkland activists, suggesting during an interview with CNN that students should be learning ways to respond to a shooter rather than asking lawmakers "to solve their problem"; Santorum advised students to take classes in CPR rather than marching in Washington. "The Washington Post" quoted several doctors responding to Santorum that CPR would not be at all effective on gunshot victims as they were suffering from blood loss.
Media.
A report in "The New Yorker" praised the leaders of the march for their "extraordinary inclusiveness" in that they expanded the locus of concern from suburban schools to those of urban neighborhoods as well.
On social media, fake pictures and GIFs of X González tearing up a copy of the U.S. Constitution were circulated in an effort to discredit the march. The images were doctored from originals of González tearing up a shooting target sign. Actor and conservative commentator Adam Baldwin defended circulating the doctored images as "political satire".
Use of social media.
Previously, protests had occurred for multiple shootings in the United States, such as the 2015 Charleston church shooting, but never had they amassed more than several hundred participants. With social media, more information was relayed to a larger audience in quicker time, giving more people awareness of what was happening across the nation. By National Walkout Day on April 20, 2018, the social medias had followings over 1.3 million people and in Washington, D.C., alone, 200,000 people attended the March For Our Lives protest, whom many younger adults attributed to the big social media presence. The hashtag #MarchForOurLives was used 3.6 million times, and over 7.5 thousand tweets were directed at the NRA social media account.
Twitter.
The use of Twitter started when this movement originated after the Parkland shooting in Florida, where 17 individuals lost their lives. During the shooting, multiple students used Twitter, including freshman Aidan Minoff, who tweeted, "I am in a school shooting right now..." Twitter allowed others around the world to suddenly be aware of what was happening in real time and showing the raw emotion of these students. Twitter was a more "formal" news platform that supported greater two-way communication between the organization and the audience.
The March For Our Lives Twitter started in February 2018, with the Twitter handle, @AMarch4OurLives. Up to date, the Twitter account has 450,000 followers and are a student-run organization with a large social media presence. The March For Our Lives Twitter has real time, up to date tweets about the movement. It includes tweets about the red flag bill being signed in from other March For Our Lives accounts based in different locations, such as NYC. In addition, the March For Our Lives Twitter account also alerts their followers about the events that are happening, such as meetings at Town Halls or when certain protests are happening. All of their posts follow certain guidelines and relevance, and they also continue to retweet their own tweets too.
Instagram.
In March 2018, Selena Gomez shared the march's hashtag #MarchForOurLives with the message: "Protect kids, not guns!" and this post had received 2 million likes. Lady Gaga also documented the march, releasing a series of Instagram videos calling for action from politicians to enforce stricter gun laws. The march has drawn support from Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, and they have pledged to join and perform at the march.
The students who survived the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and millions of students worldwide participated in March for Our Lives, emerging as more influential on Instagram than celebrities on the gun control. One of the tools they used were the hashtags. Top hashtags such as #MarchForOurLives #NeverAgain, #GunControlNow, and #EnoughIsEnough are used to spread the word and call on the public's attention. Instagram becomes an 'informal' narrative platform that promoted a 'clicktivism' type of responses from the audience for the march. Besides, students collaborate with Bartle Bogle Hegarty(BBH) to create the first Instagram coloring book. BBH L.A. executive creative director Zach Hilder said, "we wanted to give them tools to elevate their voices, create a way to unify their message and allow everyone to participate in the march. That's the inspiration for Color for Our Lives."
Facebook.
The March For Our Lives movement employs Facebook as another social media platform to spread awareness of its campaigns and messages to people around the world. As of March 5th 2019, nineteen days before the one yer anniversary of the protests, the MFOL Facebook page has garnered more than 300,000 followers. The page is mainly used to provide updates on national policies regarding gun laws, as well as coverage of various politicians who advocate for more gun safety. Similar to other media platforms, the Facebook page frequently employs popular hashtags such as #MarchForOurLives and #NeverAgain in its posts. Although other social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram often make posts to increase awareness, Facebook is more often used to organize people in nearby marches or demonstrations in major cities, and this has seen great success. For example, Facebook played a role in the March 24, 2018 March For Our Lives and Never Again collaboration gathering in Washington, D.C., where more than 47,000 people marked themselves as "going," and where more than 90,000 people from across the nation and world marked themselves as "interested" on the Facebook events posting. This shows the magnitude of Facebook as a platform for organizing unrelated people to gather together for the same cause.
Snapchat.
The March For Our Lives movement leveraged Snapchat to gain momentum, spread the word and draw attention to what students and supporters were doing around the United States in response to recent shootings on school campuses. Unique from other social media platforms, Snapchat contains a map feature that allowed the world to see when and where activities by its users is taking place. This allowed the student walkouts to be easily tracked around the US. Video shows thousands of students and supporters walking the streets, protesting gun violence and current gun laws. Snapchat created a "March For Our Lives" Sticker that could be used by the platform's users to document the walkouts around the US.
Celebrity Controversy.
Jesse Hughes, a survivor of the Bataclan terrorist attack, called the march "pathetic", but after being criticized for his comment, later apologized saying, "I was not attempting to impugn the youth of America and this beautiful thing that they accomplished. I truly am sorry, I did not mean to hurt anyone or cause any harm."

Scott Boyer

Charles Scott Boyer II (October 17, 1947 – February 13, 2018) was an American singer-songwriter and guitarist. Boyer was best known for co-founding the band Cowboy. Boyer was born in Chenango, New York, and moved to Jacksonville, Florida in his youth.
After high school, he played in the band the 31st of February. He co-founded Cowboy with songwriter Tommy Talton in 1969, which released four albums and supported the Allman Brothers Band on tour. Boyer's song "Please Be with Me" was later covered by Eric Clapton. After Cowboy's breakup, Boyer continued playing music. He moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1988 and continued playing in a band called the Decoys until his death in 2018.
Life and career.
Boyer was born in Chenango, New York. He first began receiving music lessons at age four, and he became interested in folk music through groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. He and his family later relocated to Louisville, Kentucky, and then Jacksonville, Florida. He graduated from Englewood High School, where he was a part of the school's orchestra. He then attended Florida State University studying viola, but dropped out.
He later became a part of the group The Bitter Ind., which later changed their name to the 31st of February. In 1969, he and songwriter Tommy Talton formed the southern rock/country rock outfit Cowboy, which signed to Macon, Georgia-based Capricorn Records at guitarist Duane Allman's suggestion. The band relocated to Macon and subsequently released four albums—"Reach for the Sky" (1970), "5'll Getcha Ten" (1971), "Boyer &amp; Talton" (1974), and "Cowboy" (1977). Though they remained largely obscure, Cowboy supported the Allman Brothers Band on its tours and later served as the backing band for Gregg Allman's 1974 solo tour. "Please Be with Me", written by Boyer, later went on to be covered by Eric Clapton for his 1974 album "461 Ocean Boulevard".
After Cowboy's dissolution in the late 1970s, Boyer continued to play music. He briefly moved to Los Angeles, where he wrote songs with Ricky Hirsch from Wet Willie, and produced an album for a band called the Sky Boys. He later joined a band called Locust Fork, and then another band called the Convertibles which briefly reunited him with Talton. He moved to Muscle Shoals, Alabama in 1988 and began performing with the Decoys, a band founded by Johnny Sandlin, who produced Cowboy's albums as well as albums by the Allman Brothers and Widespread Panic.
He released a solo album called "All My Friends" in 1991, and released a collaboration album with N.C. Thurman in 2012 titled "Ok, How About This". He and Talton reformed Cowboy in 2007 and recorded an album's worth of material with Sandlin, but this material has never been released. They staged one more live performance as Cowboy in 2010, which was issued the following year as a live album, titled "Boyer &amp; Talton: Cowboy Reunion 2010".
In 2007, Boyer was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. The Birmingham, Alabama-based Garage Café—where the Decoys would often perform—hosted a benefit concert to help with his medical bills in 2013. Boyer died in Muscle Shoals on February 13, 2018. Talton said, "No one could write a more beautiful ballad than Scott Boyer. I love him and I miss him more than anything that can be said." Singer-songwriter and Drive-By Truckers guitarist Jason Isbell, tweeted that "Scott Boyer was the first real songwriter that ever took me seriously. I was living on his couch when I met [Drive-By Truckers co-founder] Patterson Hood. Scott wrote beautiful songs, and he was a damn good singer. We’ll all miss him a lot."

SB Pudge

SB "Pudge" is a wooden Thames sailing barge, built in Rochester, Kent, England in 1922. Her hull was pitch pine on oak frame. She was originally spritsail rigged with bowsprit. An auxiliary oil engine made by The Bergius Co.Ltd of Glasgow was installed in 1932. She was used to carry various cargoes for the London &amp; Rochester Trading Co until 1968, when she was bought out of trade by the Thames Sailing Barge Trust. Her last cargo was pineapple juice.
History.
Thames sailing barges were the heavy goods vehicles of their time, moving 150 tons of loose cargo at a time from outside the capital to the city. They brought in coal for the furnaces, bricks to construct mills and houses, and hay for the horses. Barges were used to transport rubbish from various cities out to the brickfields where it was used as fuel; it was only for the last mile of the trip to the brickfields that road transport had to be used. The spritsail rig has many advantages on rivers and in confined waters: maneuvering under topsail and mizzen catching the steadier wind clear of the wharf side buildings. Their flat-bottomed hulls allow them to ride over the shallow waters of the estuary and penetrate the creeks and higher reaches of the rivers of the south east. They could be berthed on a flat mud bank, against a camp-shed, on a barge bed or a held tide dock. Pudge carried general cargo:grain, cattle cake, fertilizer, etc..
World War II.
The first major civilian maritime event of the Second World War was the Dunkirk evacuation, in which hundreds of small ships rescued Allied soldiers from beaches in northern France. Like many of the sailing barge fleet, "Pudge" was requisitioned in May 1940 whilst in Tilbury, and sailed down to the assembly point at Dover. Under cover of darkness, the tug "St. Fagan" towed three barges, "Pudge", "Thyra" and "Lady Rosebery", to Dunkirk, and released them toward the beaches. "St Fagan" was hit by a mine, and she, "Lady Rosebery" and "Doris" were sunk. "Pudge" was lifted out of the water but "she came down the right way up". She took survivors on board and set off for England, picking up a tow from the tug "Tanga" on the way, to arrive safely back at Ramsgate.
1988 Reconstruction.
Hundred-year-old wooden boats need continuous maintenance. The planking and the flooring become soft, indicating a lack of strength, or even rot. Those components are easily replaced with other planks of pitch pine, though the wood in elements of the frame remains hidden, and requires stripping back to inspect and eventually replace. If the bow or the stern start to droop, the frame is suffering some problem, and the immediate thought is that it is rot. A loaded commercial barge would lie low in the water, and the water would support the structure and, in turn, the stresses caused by the standing rigging. A passenger-carrying barge would be subjected to greater stresses. The "Pudge" was displaying those symptoms. When the doubling was stripped back, many of the floors, and the port inner chine plank and the chine keelsons, were cracked or dislodged. These were oak timbers, in some cases up to long. The damage was put down to two collisions, a sinking, a stranding, and the effect of the exploding mine at Dunkirk. Different woods were used in the reconstruction because timber of the original specification was no longer available.

Mamulanar

Mamulanar (Tamil: மாமூலனார்) was a poet of the Sangam period, to whom 31 verses of the Sangam literature have been attributed, including verse 8 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.
Biography.
Manulanar belonged to the Brahmin caste. Mamulanar has described about the destruction of Pataliputra by River Ganges. However, there was no mention about the event of Patalipura fire of the 1st century CE. These suggest that Mamulanar lived no later than the 1st century BCE. Also, his writing about the Mauryas and Nandas indicated that he must have lived before 320 BCE. All his writings are known to contain historical information.
Contribution to the Sangam literature.
Mamulanar has written 31 verses, including 1 in Kurunthogai (verse 11), 2 in Natrinai, 27 in Agananuru, and 1 in Tiruvalluva Maalai.

St Mary's, Fochabers

St Mary's, Fochabers is a Roman Catholic church in the village of Fochabers, Moray, in Scotland and is a part of the RC Diocese of Aberdeen. The building is significant for the high quality of its altar and stained glass windows. It is an active parish church served from Buckie with regular weekly Sunday Mass at 10.00 am.
Fochabers, and the broader Bog o' Gight area, had been a hotbed of Catholic recusancy as the Gordon family of Gordon Castle had clung to the Catholic faith from 1560–1728. Prior to this building there had been a chapel in the old village of Fochabers, which had been spared burning by the Duke of Cumberland's troops after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745.
, and later the area was served by the mission at St Ninian's Church, Tynet.
The church was completed in 1826, the architect being James Gillespie Graham, with the foundation stone being laid by Father George Mathieson, who was born in Fochabers himself, in 1825. Fr Mathieson said of the new building that it will be 'an ornament to the town, and I hope draw respect to Religion'. In 1885 a reredos by Peter Paul Pugin was installed. Later, in memory of the Clapperton family, two stained glass windows designed by the acclaimed Franz Mayer &amp; Co. were fitted, one with a paschal theme and one with a Marian theme.

1st Manchester Rifles

The 1st Manchester Rifles, later the 6th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, was a unit of Britain's Volunteer Force and Territorial Army recruited in and around Manchester. It served as infantry at Gallipoli, fighting with distinction at the Third Battle of Krithia, and in some of the bitterest battles on the Western Front in World War I. After conversion into an anti-aircraft unit of the Royal Artillery between the wars, it defended Manchester, Scapa Flow and Ceylon during World War II and continued in the air defence role until 1955.
Volunteer Force.
The enthusiasm for the Volunteer movement following an invasion scare in 1859 saw the creation of many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) composed of part-time soldiers eager to supplement the Regular British Army in time of need. One such unit was the 6th Lancashire RVC raised at Manchester following a public meeting on 20 May 1859. The first 60 volunteers were sworn in on 7 June and began drilling at the Militia Barracks under staff sergeants of the 6th Lancashire Militia. The unit was formally accepted by the Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire, the Earl of Sefton, on 25 August 1859. A number of large Manchester firms such as J.P. &amp; E. Westhead (3rd Company) and J. &amp; N. Philips (8th Company) provided whole companies from their employees, others came from the Manchester Cotton Exchange (4th Company) and from the Athenaeum Gymnastic Club (5th (1st Athenaeum) Company under Captain William Romaine Callender). Volunteers from the townships of Hulme, Moss Side, Cornbrook and Stretford, including groups from the Commercial Mills at Hulme and from T.G. Hill &amp; Co, formed a 7th (Old Trafford) Company. The 6th Lancashire RVC soon had a strength of 12 companies. Viscount Grey de Wilton was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant on 19 February 1860 and by the following month the unit had adopted the additional title of 1st Manchester Rifles. The 2nd and 3rd Manchester Rifles and the Ardwick Artizan Rifles (numbered as the 28th, 40th and 33rd Lancashire RVCs respectively) also appeared at this time, making up an unofficial Manchester Brigade at the Volunteer reviews.
The 1st Manchester Rifle Volunteers opened its headquarters (HQ) in Hopwood Avenue and its members drilled in various warehouses, in Carpenter's Hall, the Bazaar in Bridge Street, at Salford Dyeworks, and at the Cavalry Barracks in Hulme. The Old Trafford company paraded at Pomona Gardens and later at the Infantry Barracks at Salford, where they drilled under Regular Army staff sergeants of the 96th Regiment. The majority of volunteers enrolled in the unit were warehousemen and clerks. The uniform was scarlet with yellow facings.
In October 1860, No 12 Company, based at Eccles, transferred to the 46th Lancashire RVC at Swinton but the following year the 6th absorbed the 43rd Lancashire RVC, originally raised on 11 February 1860 at Fallowfield. In March 1865 the 1st Manchesters moved their HQ to an office at 1 Brown Street, and then in July the following year to Wolstenholme's Court, Market Street, Manchester, where it stayed for a number of years. Drills were carried out at Barker's Riding School in Greenheys. From the 1880s the HQ and drill hall was at 3 Stretford Road, Hulme.
Under the 'Localisation of the Forces' introduced by the Cardwell Reforms, the 6th was linked with other Manchester-based RVCs, Militia regiments and the Regular 63rd and 96th Foot into Brigade No 16 (Lancashire). When the 63rd and 96th were amalgamated to create the Manchester Regiment in 1881 as part of the Childers Reforms, the 6th Lancashire RVC was formally attached to it as a Volunteer Batalion on 1 July, and changed its designation to 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Manchester Regiment on 1 September 1887. Under the mobilisation plan introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum in 1891, the five (later six) Volunteer Battalions of the regiment constituted the Manchester Brigade.
Between 1887 and 1908 the 2nd VB maintained a Mounted infantry company. Volunteers from the battalion served in a Service Company alongside the Regulars of the regiment during the Second Boer War, gaining the battalion its first Battle Honour South Africa 1900–1902. According to their memorial, 157 men of the 2nd VB served during the war, of whom six died on active service.
Territorial Force.
When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908, the 2nd Volunteer Battalion became the 6th Battalion, Manchester Regiment, except 'N' Company at Manchester University, which became part of the Officers' Training Corps and was the forerunner of today's Manchester &amp; Salford University OTC. The Manchester Brigade became part of the East Lancashire Division of the TF.
World War I.
Mobilisation.
On the outbreak of war, the division was at its annual camp when the order to mobilise was received at 05.30 on 4 August. The units returned to their drill halls to mobilise, the men being billeted close by. On 20 August, having volunteered for overseas service, the division moved into camps for training, and on 9 September it entrained for Southampton to embark for Egypt. 6th Manchesters were under Lt-Col G.G.P. Heywood, who had been commanding officer (CO) since 1 September 1911.
On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd Line units for each existing TF unit was authorised. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right. From now on, the original battalion was designated the 1/6th Manchesters, and the 2nd Line was the 2/6th; later a 3rd line battalion was formed.
1/6th Battalion.
The East Lancashire Division began to disembark at Alexandria on 25 September and the 6th Manchesters went into garrison at Mustapha Barracks in that city. At first the division's role was simply to relieve Regular troops from the garrison for service on the Western Front, but on 5 November Britain declared war on Turkey and Egypt became a war zone. While the East Lancashire Division went to guard the Suez Canal, the Manchester Bde was detached to garrison Cairo.
Gallipoli.
On 3 May 1915 the battalion (under the command of Major C.R. Pilkington, Lt-Col Heywood being unfit) embarked at Alexandria on the SS "Derfflinger", a captured German Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line vessel that had just arrived with a cargo of wounded from the initial landings at Gallipoli. "Derfflinger" missed her intended landing spot at Cape Helles, and so the Manchesters arrived late on 6 May, after the rest of the division had gone into action. The 1/6th Bn bivouacked above 'W' Beach ('Lancashire Landing') and during the night of 7/8 May was moved, with ammunition, rations and entrenching equipment, but no blankets or baggage, to the Krithia sector, where the men went into the firing line for a 10-day period. On 12 May the brigade made a feint attack to attract attention away from a movement elsewhere
On 25 May, the East Lancashire Division was formally designated 42nd (East Lancashire) Division, and the Manchester Brigade became 127th (Manchester) Brigade.
During another spell in front of Krithia beginning on 25 May, the 1/6th and 1/5th Manchesters advanced their line between 50 and . The lines were now within assaulting distance of the nearest Turkish trenches, and a new attack (the Third Battle of Krithia) was launched on 4 June. After a bombardment starting at 08.00, the assault was launched at noon. The Manchester Brigade led 42nd Division's attack, with half of 1/6th Bn on the left, and in this sector all went well to begin with: despite intense rifle and machine gun fire the brigade took all its first objectives, the second wave passing through and parties advancing up to into the Turkish fourth line. The "Official History" records that 'The Manchester Territorials, fighting like veterans, were all in high fettle'. There was almost nothing between them and Krithia, and beyond that the ultimate target of Achi Baba. However, things had gone disastrously wrong for 127 Bde's neighbours, and the Turks were counter-attacking both flanks. C Company of 1/6th Bn, which had advanced furthest, was cut off and practically wiped out. Although the Manchesters held on to the first Turkish line they had captured, casualties had been severe, and only 160 out of 770 men of 1/6th Bn answered evening roll-call. The Manchesters consolidated their position on 5 June before being relieved that night and going into reserve.
On 12 June the Manchester Brigade was withdrawn from the Gallipoli Peninsula and went to the island of Imbros for rest. It returned to Cape Helles on 22 June and 1/6th Bn went up to the firing line in the Krithia Nullah sector on 24 June. They held the Turkish trench they had captured while the formations on either flank attempted to improve their positions. The sector was given trench names reminiscent of home: 'Stretford Road', 'Greenheys Lane', 'Ardwick Green', "etc". The 1/6th Manchesters then spent the next six weeks alternating in the line with 1/5th and 1/8th Bns, taking casualties steadily.
A new attack at Helles (the Battle of Krithia Vineyard) began in August. 42nd Division delivered its main attack at 09.45 on 7 August, but despite the bombardment and assistance from machine guns and trench mortars, 127 Bde could make little progress. 1/6th Manchesters, described by the divisional commander as 'that fine battalion', seized a Turkish redoubt in Krithia Nullah and held it 'until they were practically annihilated'. By 19.15 that evening the Manchesters were back in their old positions. 127th Brigade was temporarily unfit for service and its total strength was only that of a single battalion, though it relieved 125th (Lancashire Fusiliers) Brigade on 8/9 August and continued the fight, with 1/6th Bn doing good work in defending a trench near Krithia Vineyard. After a short rest and receiving a few drafts and returning casualties, the division was put back into the line on 19 August, still badly under strength and suffering from sickness. The 1/5th and 1/6th Manchesters were temporarily combined under the command of Lt-Col Pilkington.
During September the Turks exploded a series of mines in front of the British trench known as the 'Gridiron' and damaging its defences. Repairs after one mine on 22 September were covered by a bombing party of 1/6th Manchesters who held the lip of the crater. The same day the Royal Engineers exploded a counter-mine and the Manchesters rushed the crater and built a barrier across it. Captain Harold Cawley of 1/6th Bn, the Member of parliament for Heywood, was killed that night by a Turkish sniper, and the crater became known as 'Cawley's Crater'. The division continued to hold its position, suffering casualties from mining and bad weather, until its infantry were evacuated to Mudros on 29 December.
Romani.
The Gallipoli Campaign was shut down at the beginning of January, but 42nd Division remained on Mudros until the middle of the month before returning to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) and the Suez Canal defences. From February to 1916 it was stationed at Shallufa, base for the Southern Sector of the defences, broken by spells of training in the desert. In June the division was moved to the Central Sector, between Ismailia and Qantara. In July, 42nd Division became part of a Mobile Column (under Maj-Gen Hon Herbert Lawrence, former brigadier of 127 Bde) formed to counter a threatened Turkish thrust across the Sinai desert before it reached the canal. 127 Brigade was the advanced brigade of this force, and on 3 August 1/6th Manchesters moved to Pelusium, six miles north-west of Romani to prepare defences to cover the railhead for the arrival of the rest of the brigade. The Battle of Romani opened early on the morning of 4 August, and the rest of 127 Bde was rushed up, passing through 1/6th Manchesters to support the Anzac Mounted Division, which was heavily engaged. That night the 1/6th Manchesters escorted the camel transport carrying vital water and supplies up to the front line troops, and then rejoined 127 Bde. During 5 and 6 August the brigade pursued the defeated Turkish force, suffering badly from extreme heat and lack of water, with many men falling out through exhaustion, until it reached Qatiya.
During the Autumn the railway and water pipeline were pushed forward, and 42nd Division participated in the EEF's Advance to Wadi el Arish, which began in late November 1916 and completed the Sinai Campaign in January 1917.
Western Front.
42nd Division was now ordered to join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front. In early February 1917 it returned to Egypt and by 2 March the last troopship had left for France. The troops were concentrated at Pont-Remy, near Abbeville, and re-equipped; the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield rifle was issued in place of the obsolescent long model with which the battalions had gone to war. The division was employed on working parties in the area abandoned by the Germans when they retired to the Hindenburg Line, and then the brigades started taking turns in the line near Havrincourt Wood. On the night of 8/9 June all four battalions of the Manchesters went into No man's land to dig a new trench closer to the enemy line, which was completed and occupied the following night. The battalions also carried out regular night patrols and raids.
From 9 July to 22 August the division was in reserve, with 127 Bde stationed at Achiet-le-Petit. It then moved to the Ypres Salient to join the Third Ypres Offensive, passing through the Menin Gate on the night of 1 September. On 6 September 125 (Lancashire Fusiliers) Bde made an attack, with 1/6th Manchesters attached to provide carrying parties. After the failed attack, the Manchesters carried many of the Lancashire Fusiliers' dead back for burial.
After 18 days in the Salient, the division was relieved and moved to the Nieuport Sector on the Belgian coast, where it remained under constant shellfire until November. It then moved to the La Bassée–Béthune sector where it spent the winter building concrete defences to replace the existing poor breastworks. The BEF was now suffering a manpower crisis, and in February 1918 around a quarter of its battalions were disbanded to reinforce others; the Manchesters absorbed drafts from the disbanded 1/9th and 2/10th Bns.
Spring Offensive.
When the German spring offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 42nd Division was in reserve, and on 23 March it was sent south in motor buses to reinforce Third Army. 127 Brigade debussed at midnight on the Ayette–Douchy road and set up an outpost line. The following day the division was ordered to relieve 40th Division, and 127 Bde advanced in artillery formation across open ground to take up its positions. At dawn on 25 March the Germans attacked, making some penetrations but being stopped by the Manchesters. On reports that another attack was assembling SE of Bihucourt, 1/6th Manchesters sent a company there. This arrived simultaneously with the Germans and immediately made two attacks on them, finally being forced out of the village by superior numbers. This action gave time for reinforcements to stop the enemy advancing beyond Bihucourt to Achiet-le-Grand, which the CO of 1/6th Manchesters was ordered to prevent at all costs.
By 26 March the enemy was working round the division's flanks, and it was ordered to pull back to the Bucquoy–Ablainzevelle line; 127 Brigade slipped away unnoticed. The German advance was held in front of Bucquoy, despite heavy shellfire, and on the night of 27/28 March 1/6th Manchesters sent an aggressive patrol back into Ablainzevelle, which caused casualties and disruption. The following day the battalion counter-attacked again, breaking up another German attack, and held the line all day. During one of the hottest attacks Corporal A. Brooks noticed that his men were running short of rifle oil and suffering jams, so he calmly went up and down the line with an oil can, lubricating rifle bolts while under fire. The first stage of the German offensive had been checked, although shellfire and raiding continued along the line until the division was relieved on 8 April.
When the division returned to the line front, the Third Army line was relatively quiet, the Germans having switched their offensive to the north. The policy was now to advance the line by means of small raids and aggressive patrolling (so-called 'peaceful penetration') and 1/6th Manchesters actively advanced by these means between 20 and 24 July, and in August held off determined attacks on these positions. In July the division was struck by the flu epidemic, but did receive some drafts: on 31 July the 1/6th Manchesters absorbed the remaining cadre of the 2/6th Manchesters from 66th Division ("see below"), and thereafter was simply referred to as the 6th Bn.
Hundred Days Offensive.
The Allied counter-offensive began with the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August), as a result of which the Germans began to give ground, and 42nd Division followed up against rearguards. Third Army began its formal assault (the Battle of Albert) on 21 August. 125 Brigade advance behind a creeping barrage onto its first objective, then the barrage switched to precede 127 Brigade advancing with 6th Manchesters on the right. Assisted by morning mist, the Manchesters took their first objective, and then cleared the ravine in which the Beaucourt–Puisieux road ran, the men getting to close quarter fighting with the defenders. However, it took two attempts for the brigades to take their third objective, the Manchesters finally advancing along the ridge up to Miraumont. A counter-attack from Miraumont at 04.15 the following morning was shattered by the Manchesters, as were two more against the division that day. On 24 August the Manchesters worked round Miraumont, 6th Bn securing fords over the River Ancre, and large numbers of prisoners were taken. The division continued to advance slowly against rearguards until the end of the month. Lieutenant-Colonel T. Blatherwick, commanding 6th Manchesters, was awarded a DSO for making reconnaissances under fire. On 2 September 127 Bde put in an attack on Villers-au-Flos with support from tanks, aircraft, mortars and a creeping barrage, 6th Bn on the left making good progress as the village was enveloped and cleared. The division then exploited this success, and a period of open warfare ensued, with cavalry going into action.
After a period of rest, the division returned to the line for the set-piece assault on the Hindenburg Line (the Battle of the Canal du Nord). 127 Brigade advanced at 08.20 on 27 September with 5th Manchesters leading over the Trescault Ridge to the first objective, after which 6th and 7th Bns passed through to the second and third objectives despite losses from machine guns. By 14.30, a weak company of the 6th Manchesters was on the fourth objective. The 6th and 7th Battalions were now too weak to attempt the final objective, but it was taken that night by the rest of the division, which continued to advance the following morning.
42nd Division next participated in the Battle of the Selle. The divisional Royal Engineers bridged the River Selle on the nights of 17–19 October and the attack went in at 02.00 on 20 October. 127 Brigade set off at 07.00 and passed through towards the second objective. Although the leading company of 6th Manchesters suffered casualties from machine gun nests, these were successfully cleared out and the battalion captured the village of Marou. Although the men of 6th Bn were anxious to carry on to the third objective, they were ordered to consolidate until the 5th Bn on their right could catch up. The Germans massed for a counter-attack at midday, but this was broken up by artillery and machine gun fire and 127 Bde captured its final objective that afternoon. When the advance was resumed on 23 October 127 Bde was in support. During the subsequent pursuit (3–11 November), it remained in support, marching through the Forest of Mormal and across the River Sambre behind 42nd Division's advanced guards until the Armistice with Germany came into effect on 11 November.
42nd Division remained at Hautmont on the Sambre during November, then moved to Charleroi where demobilisation began. As the men went home the division's units were reduced to cadres by 16 March 1919, and 6th Bn was disembodied on 10 April.
Commanding officers.
The following officers served as CO of the 1/6th Manchesters during the war:
2/6th Battalion.
The 2/6th Bn was formed at Hulme in August 1914 and shortly afterwards was included in the 2/1st Manchester Brigade of 2nd East Lancashire Division. There was a great shortage of arms and equipment, and the 2nd Line Lancashire units had to train with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles until the end of 1915. Training was also interrupted by the need to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1/6th Bn overseas. It was not until August 1915 that the division (now numbered as the 66th (2nd East Lancashire), with the 2/1st Manchester Bde as 199 (Manchester)) was able to concentrate in Kent and Sussex. By the end of the month all Home Service men had left to join Provisional Battalions ("see below"). Early in 1916 the division was transferred to coastal defence duties in East Anglia, but training was still hindered by the requirement to supply drafts to the 42nd Division. It was not until 1 January 1917 that the division was declared ready for overseas service.
The division began embarking at the end of February, and was concentrated at Berguette and Thiennes by 16 March. It served in the desultory operations along the Flanders coast in the summer, then moved to the Ypres salient in October to join the Third Ypres Offensive.
Poelcapelle.
The division's first attack was on 9 October at the Battle of Poelcappelle. Its role was to advance up a ridge to the outskirts of the village of Passchendaele. Ground conditions were bad, but it was believed that there was no German wire to negotiate. The division began its approach march at 19.00 the evening before, and was expected to be resting at its jumping-off line by midnight. But the mud was so bad that the troops arrived 20 minutes after the attack was launched, and simply fixed bayonets and kept walking. As well as the mud, which seriously hindered movement, clogged weapons and deadened artillery fire, they were faced by unanticipated barbed wire. The artillery had made no impression on German pillboxes. Although patrols from 66th Division did reach Passchendaele, by the end of the day all temporary gains had been wiped out, and the division did note even hold a consolidated line.
Operation Michael.
When the German Spring Offensive opened, 66th Division had recently been moved from Ypres to Fifth Army and was holding a line among the undulating valleys of the River Somme's tributaries. Reconnaissance had revealed strange new holes in No man's land, which turned out to be forming-up points for the German Stormtroopers. The divisional front was held by three battalions in the Forward Zone and three out of the other six in the Battle Zone. 2/6th Manchesters was among the battalions held back from the Battle Zone, but the divisional commander had forbidden them to move into position until the battle actually started. Aided by early morning fog, the German attack on 21 March quickly broke through the Forward Zone, isolating the battalions, and continued into the Battle Zone.
The Manchesters now had to march up to their allotted positions under gas shelling, 2/6th Bn moving up the hill from Montigny towards Hervilly, which was under heavy shellfire, and into Hervilly Wood. Casualties had been light so far, but between 11.00 and 11.15 the Germans advancing in the fog split the battalion and surrounded both A and C Companies. Battalion HQ formed a defensive line and 2/6th Manchesters held on at Fervague Farm for several hours, until driven out at 13.00 by flamethrowers. Many of the survivors were captured, and when the battalion reached Carpenza Copse it consisted of only 12 officers and 150 men. Here, under the command of Maj John Whitworth and joined by some dismounted cavalry, they held on doggedly until 14.00 on 22 March before falling back under cover of fog to the 'Green Line' at Hébécourt, where 50th (Northumbrian) Division was hurriedly digging in.
The remnants of 66th Division took up position on the Somme Canal at Péronne, where 2/5th and 2/6th Manchesters held 'Bristol Bridge' for the retiring rearguards of 16th (Irish) Division until the Germans entered Peronne late on 24 March. The bridge was then demolished at 18.00 by 180th Tunnelling Company, RE, and the retreat continued to Rosières, where the division narrowly escaped being surrounded, until Germans were halted by a new defence line on the River Luce.
66th Division had suffered some of the heaviest casualties during the battle, and in April its battered battalions were reduced to training cadres. 2/6th Manchesters was disbanded on 31 July, the remaining personnel being transferred to the 1/6th Bn in 42nd Division.
3/6th Battalion.
This battalion was formed at Hulme in March 1915, with the role of training drafts for the 1/6th and 2/6th Bns. Early in 1916 it moved to Witley. On 8 April that year it was renamed the 6th Reserve Bn, Manchester Regiment, and on 1 September it was absorbed into the 5th Reserve Bn.
28th Battalion.
The Home Service men of the 6th Manchesters, together with those of other TF battalions of the Manchesters and Lancashire Fusiliers, were combined into 45th Provisional Battalion, which became 28th Manchesters on 1 January 1917. It served in 73rd Division and was disbanded in 1918.
Interwar.
42nd (East Lancashire) Division began reforming at home in April 1920. When the TF was reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1921, the 6th Manchesters was combined with the 7th Battalion (originally the 3rd Manchester RVC) and reformed at Hulme as the 6th/7th Battalion, Manchester Regiment in 127 (Manchester) Brigade of 42nd Division on 31 December.
In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA brigades of the Royal Artillery (RA). The 6th/7th Manchesters was one unit selected for this role, becoming 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Anti-Aircraft Brigade, RA (TA) on 10 December 1936, still based at Hulme. The unit consisted of 181, 182, 183 and 196 Batteries, and initially formed part of 33rd (Western) Anti-Aircraft Group in 2nd AA Division. On 1 January 1939 the RA adopted the more normal terminology of 'regiment' instead of 'brigade', which allowed the AA groups to adopt the designation of 'brigades'. By then, the 33rd AA Bde had moved to 4th AA Division in Anti-Aircraft Command, and by the outbreak of war in September, 65th AA Regiment had moved to a new 44 AA Brigade within 4 AA Division.
World War II.
Mobilisation and Phoney War.
The TA's AA units were mobilised on 23 September 1938 during the Munich Crisis, with units manning their emergency positions within 24 hours, even though many did not yet have their full complement of men or equipment. The emergency lasted three weeks, and they were stood down on 13 October. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. 65th AA Regiment was at a practice camp at Burrow Head in Scotland when AA Command was fully mobilised on 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war. It immediately travelled back to man its war stations and was joined by its attached Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) company, which had been training at Manorbier in Wales.
Initially, the regiment manned sites with old 3-inch guns and a few modern 3.7-inch static guns. The first 4.5-inch guns began arriving in November. Surplus men manned Lewis light machine guns (LMGs) at Vital Points (VPs) including 181 Bty at Kearsley Power Station. A single 3-inch gun of the regiment was posted at Baxter's respirator (gas mask) factory at Leyland. By November the regiment was distributed as follows:
196 Battery fired the regiment's first shots on 17 November when J Gunsite engaged a single Heinkel He 111 that entered the area. The VPs were soon taken over by specialist Light AA (LAA) units. On 1 June 1940, the RA's AA regiments were redesignated Heavy AA (HAA) to distinguish them from the newer LAA units being formed, the 65th becoming 65th (The Manchester Regiment) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, RA.
Battle of Britain.
In June 1940, after the end of the Phoney War and the Dunkirk evacuation, 65th HAA Rgt was distributed as follows:
During the height of the post-Dunkirk invasion scare in July 1940, 181 HAA Bty was temporarily detached to 6th HAA Rgt in 2 AA Bde in Kent. This regiment was involved in a defence scheme codenamed 'Bovril' to defend roads leading inland from possible invasion sites on the South Coast and was also reconnoitring the area for future AA gunsites.
In August, 181 HAA Bty was once again attached to 6th HAA Rgt, now stationed in the West Midlands, to allow that regiment's batteries to attend practice camps. It manned gunsites H1 at Coven Heath and H18 at Merry Hill.
As the Battle of Britain progressed, small numbers of "Luftwaffe" bombers appeared over North West England by day and night, leading to a few AA engagements and a small amount of damage. These increased in late August, with considerable damage in the Bolton and Chorley areas on the night of 28/29 August. Gunsites B and J opened fire using the new GL Mk I gunlaying radar, causing some raiders to take evasive action.
Home Defence.
At the beginning of October, 65th HAA Rgt went to the Orkney &amp; Shetland Defence Force (OSDEF), where it served in 58 AA Bde defending the naval base at Scapa Flow.
The regiment supplied a cadres of experienced officers and other ranks to provide the basis for a new 402 HAA Bty formed on 12 December 1940 at 210th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, which joined 123rd HAA Rgt. It regiment provided another cadre to 211th HAA Training Rgt, Oswestry, which formed 432 HAA Bty on 8 May 1941. This battery did return to 65th HAA Rgt on 6 August, replacing 182 Bty transferred to newly-formed 128th HAA Rgt.
The regiment returned to mainland UK in June 1941, joining 34 AA Bde defending Birmingham and Coventry in 11 AA Division.
In the autumn of 1941 the regiment moved again, joining 51 AA Bde in 3 AA Division in Scotland. On 4 November 1941, 432 HAA Bty transferred to 136th HAA Rgt and was replaced by 465 HAA Bty, also from a cadre supplied by the regiment and formed at 209th HAA Training Rgt at Blandford on 7 August. The regiment then left AA Command in December and joined the War Office Reserve, preparatory to going overseas. The war establishment for overseas service was three batteries, so 465 HAA Bty left to help form a new 146th HAA Rgt.
Overseas.
65th HAA Regiment left the UK in January 1942 as part of the reinforcements for the Far East following the Japanese invasion of Malaya. It reached Ceylon in March, and Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service raids against Colombo and Trincomalee began on 5 April (the Easter Sunday Raid) using Nakajima B5N 'Kate' bombers escorted by Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters. Lacking effective radar cover the HAA gunners had difficulty engaging their targets against strong dazzle from the sun but claimed a number of 'kills'. The Japanese Naval aircraft raided again on 9 April, causing further damage. Over succeeding months the AA defences were improved, with GL Mk II radar, and the Japanese threat diminished.
By degrees, the AA defences of Ceylon were taken over by Indian Artillery units and the British regiments were released for service elsewhere. In March 1943, 65th HAA Rgt sailed with 181, 183 and 196 Btys to join Middle East Forces, and by May it was with 8 AA Bde at Tahag in Egypt. This formation was not yet operational but was training for the Allied invasion of Italy.
In the event, 8 AA Bde did not move to Italy until December 1943, and 65th HAA Rgt did not go with it. It returned to Home Forces in August 1944 and remained in the UK for the remainder of the war. The regiment with 181, 183 and 196 HAA Btys was placed in suspended animation on 15 June 1946.
Postwar.
When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, the regiment reformed as 465 (Manchester) HAA Regiment RA, with its HQ still at Stretford Road, Hulme. It formed part of 70 AA Bde (the former 44 AA Bde based at Salford).
On 10 March 1955, AA Command was abolished, and there were wholesale disbandments and amalgamations among its units. 465 HAA Regiment was merged with 310 (8th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers), 360, 574 (7th Bn Lancashire Fusiliers), and 606 (East Lancashire) HAA Rgts to form 314 Heavy AA Regiment, RA, with RHQ at Hulme, and P (Manchester) Battery formed from 465 and 606 HAA Rgts.
In May 1961, 314 HAA Rgt was broken up, with RHQ and P Bty amalgamated into 252 (The Manchester Artillery) Field Regiment, RA, whose present-day descendants are part of 103rd (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Regiment, RA.
Insignia.
During World War II, the 65th HAA Regiment wore a printed arm badge consisting of a yellow letter 'M' on a green square.
Battle Honours.
The battalion was awarded the battle honour South Africa 1900–1902 for the service of its volunteers during the 2nd Boer War. During World War I the battalion contributed to the honours of the Manchester Regiment. The Royal Artillery does not carry Battle Honours, so none were awarded to 65th HAA Regiment.
Honorary Colonels.
The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the unit:
Memorials.
A memorial plaque to the men of 2nd VB Manchester regiment who served in the Second Boer War is now in the Manchester &amp; Salford University OTC Hall at University Barracks in Boundary Lane. It lists 157 names, of whom six died on service.
On 12 June 1921 a memorial was unveiled at the Stretford Road drill hall comprising dark oak panels bearing the names of 1057 officers and men of the 6th Manchesters who died during World War I. When the drill hall was demolished and replaced by the new University Barracks in 1995 the panels were re-installed in the new building. A brass plate bearing the names of the members of 1/6th Bn who died in Egypt and Gallipoli was installed in the Chapel of Mustapha Barracks, Alexandria. When British troops left in 1946 the memorial was sent to England and is now also located at University Barracks. There is an elaborate marble memorial plaque in Eye Parish Church in Leominster to the three sons of Lord and Lady Cawley who were killed in World War I, including Capt H.T. Cawley, MP, of 1/6th Manchesters. Captain Cawley is buried at Lancashire Landing Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery.

Painting Life

Painting Life is a 2018 Indian English film written and directed by Bijukumar Damodaran commonly known as Dr. Biju. The film jointly produced by Silicon Media and BlueOcean Pictures depicts the experience of a film crew which gets stranded in a remote Himalayan village.
Plot.
The crew led by a hit Bollywood filmmaker arrives there to shoot a song and dance sequence for their upcoming blockbuster. Soon they find themselves cut off from the outside world after torrential downpours and landslides. They are trapped with no basic amenities or means of communication and are totally at the mercy of the forces of nature.
The team, having been accustomed only to the breakneck pace and luxury of urban life, struggles to cope with the total isolation and the rough conditions. They are forced to interface closely with nature and the local folk and experience life at a much gentler pace. They also get exposed to the challenges faced by the local people.
For the director, who has been highly successful commercially, cinema is mainly an entertainment business with no connect to the real world or social issues. He saw the valley as merely a picturesque locale for his shoot. Through a series of intense and unforgettable experiences, he begins to see the reality beyond. His eyes open to the travails of the breathtakingly beautiful land and its beleaguered residents. How those eventful days under siege, affect the thoughts and priorities of the filmmaker, both on the personal and filmmaking fronts, forms the central theme of the film.
Crew.
Painting Life is the first English feature film directed by Dr. Biju, whose earlier eight films have won national film awards.
M. J. Radhakrishnan, a 7-time winner of Kerala State Film Awards for Best Cinematography, is behind the camera.
Singaporean composer Mark Chan is composing the background score of the film. The sound design, recording and mixing are performed by the team of Jayadevan Chakkadath and Pramod Thomas. The film is co-produced by Silicon Media.
Production.
Casting.
Painting Life is a pan Indian project with a cast and crew from 10 different Indian states. The cast of the film includes Prakash Bare (Bangalore), Geetanjali Thapa (Mumbai), Ritabhari Chakraborty (Kolkata), Shankar Ramakrishnan (Kerala), Ravi Singh (Mumbai), Purav Goswami (Assam), Meera Vasudevan(Mumbai), Phuntsok Ladakhi (Jammu), Noksha Saham (Arunachal), Kinzong Bhutia (Sikkim), Master Govardhan(Kerala), Tensing Lepcha (Sikkim), Melwyn Williams (Delhi), Krishnan Balakrishnan (Kerala), Yancho Bhutia(Sikkim) and Arjun(Sikkim). Geetanjali is also the winner of National Film Award for Best Actress in 2013.
Filming.
The film is shot entirely in Sikkim, an Indian state that borders China. With its magnificent landscapes and stunning vistas, the state itself features as a major character in the movie. The movie also talks about the rampant dam construction which has systematically choked off all the rivers and badly impacted the ecology of this once-pristine state. A number of NGOs and activists from the state who continue to work tirelessly against projects that threaten the ecosystem of Sikkim, were associated with the movie both on and behind the camera.

Arthur Scott (rower)

Arthur Valentine Scott (13 February 1887 – 26 July 1966) was a South Australian rower and an AIF artilleryman who saw active service on the Western Front in WWI. He was a four-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the men's eight rowing crew. He was a member of the AIF #1 eight which won at the 1919 Henley Peace Regatta and brought the King's Cup to Australia.
Pre-war rowing.
Both pre and post-war, Scott was employed as a fireman with the South Australian Railways. Scott's senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. He, along with the rest of the champion Murray Bridge senior men's eight, was selected in South Australian state eights to contest the Australian men's interstate eights title at the Interstate Regattas of 1913 and 1914. They won the national title in 1913 and placed second in 1914.
War service.
Scott enlisted in the AIF aged 28 in August 1915. He joined the 27th Bttn. in their 8th reinforcement and embarked from Adelaide on HMAT "A30 Borda" in January 1916. On the Western Front he served initially as a Gunner with the 10th Field Artillery. He was wounded in action at Pozieres during the height of fighting on 24 July 1916 and evacuated to hospital at Etaples. He had been promoted to Lance Corporal and then acting Sergeant before being demoted to Corporal in 1917. In September 1917 he was transferred to the 11th Field Artillery. At Agincourt in May 1918 he refused an order to go up the line, was court-martialled, demoted to Gunner and sentenced to a year in military prison.
At war's end Scott rowed at the 1919 Peace Regatta at Henley-on-Thames in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) crew which won the King's Cup which in time, became the trophy for the men's eight event contested annually at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Scott was seated in the AIF#2 crew for most of the training period leading up to the July 1919 Peace Regatta. Along with Tom McGill and George Nettam he was one of the final three crew changes made to the AIF #1 eight just ten days before the event. Later that month he again raced in the Australian AIF eight when they competed at the Inter-Allied Regatta on the Seine in Paris. Scott returned to Australia in October 1919 and just three days after disembarkation in Melbourne he raced in and won a Senior Fours event (the Steward's Challenge Cup) at the Henley on Yarra regatta in Melbourne on 25 October 1919.
Post-war rowing.
Scott returned to competitive rowing at Murray Bridge. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight continued as the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the Interstate eights title (by now known as the King's Cup) at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Scott rowed in the four seat of each of those crews and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923.
The South Australian media pushed for Scott's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Scott and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than the stroke Bill Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour some of the crew busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924. In the Olympic regatta, with Scott solid in the four seat, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final.
Arthur Scott continued on as a first-class oarsman after the Olympics. He rowed at four in the South Australian representative eights in the King's Cup campaigns of 1925 (fourth) and 1926 (second). All told, Scott rowed in nine South Australian King's Cup eights in spite of war interrupting racing for five years in the middle of his career. He maintained an active involvement in rowing right through to his fifties.

<doc id="56623290" url="?curid=56623290" title="Thrombus perviousness">
Thrombus perviousness

Thrombus perviousness is an imaging biomarker which is used to estimate clot permeability from CT imaging. It reflects the ability of artery-occluding thrombi to let fluid seep into and through them. The more pervious a thrombus, the more fluid it lets through. Thrombus perviousness can be measured using radiological imaging routinely performed in the clinical management of acute ischemic stroke: CT scans without intravenous contrast (also called non-contrast CT, in short NCCT) combined with CT scans after intravenously administered contrast fluid (CT-angiography, in short CTA). Pervious thrombi may let more blood pass through to the ischemic brain tissue, and/or have a larger contact surface and histopathology more sensitive for thrombolytic medication. Thus, patients with pervious thrombi may have less brain tissue damage by stroke. The value of thrombus perviousness in acute ischemic stroke treatment is currently being researched.
Etymology.
Emilie Santos et al. introduced the term thrombus perviousness in 2016 to estimate thrombus permeability in ischemic stroke patients. Before, Mishra et al. used ‘residual flow within the clot’, and Frölich et al. used ‘antegrade flow across incomplete vessel occlusions’ to describe an estimate of thrombus permeability. Permeability is the physical measure of the ability of a material to transmit fluids over time. To measure thrombus permeability, one needs to measure contrast flow through a clot over time and the pressure drop caused by the occlusion, which is commonly not possible in the acute management of a patient with acute ischemic stroke. Current standard diagnostic protocol for acute ischemic stroke only requires single-phase imaging, visualizing the thrombus at a snapshot in time. Therefore, thrombus perviousness was introduced as a derivative measure of permeability.
Measurement.
The amount of contrast that seeps into a thrombus can be quantified by the density difference of thrombi between non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) and CT angiography (CTA) images. Two measures for thrombus perviousness have been introduced: (1) the void fraction and (2) thrombus attenuation increase (TAI).
Void fraction (ε).
The void fraction represents the ratio of the void volume within a thrombus, filled with a volume of blood (Vblood) and the volume of thrombus material (Vthrombus):formula_1Void fraction can be estimated by measuring the attenuation increase (Δ) between NCCT and CTA in the thrombus (Δthrombus) and in the contralateral artery, filling with contrast on CTA (Δblood), and subsequently compute the ratio of these Δs:formula_2
Thrombus attenuation increase.
To measure TAI, the mean attenuation (density, in Hounsfield Units) of a clot is measured on NCCT (ρthrombusNCCT) and subtracted from the thrombus density measured on CTA (ρthrombusCTA). CTA thrombus density increases after administration of the high-density contrast fluid used in CTA:
Δthrombus = ρthrombusCTA – ρthrombusNCCT
A manual (volume of interest [ROI]-based) and semi-automated (full thrombus segmentation) method have been described to measure thrombus density.
Manual 3-ROI TAI assessment.
In the manual thrombus perviousness assessment, spherical ROIs with a diameter of 2 mm are manually placed in the thrombus, both on NCCT and CTA. To improve reflection of possible thrombus heterogeneity, three ROIs are placed per imaging modality rather than one. The average of every three ROIs is calculated and used as ρthrombusNCCT and ρthrombusCTA.
Semi-automated full thrombus segmentation.
In automated measurements, the thrombus on CTA images is semi-automatically segmented in three steps.
Comparison between 3-ROI and semi-automated full thrombus measurement.
It has been shown that manual measurement tends to overestimate actual entire thrombus density, especially in low-density thrombi. Measurements based on the full thrombus show a wider variety of thrombus densities and better discrimination of high- and low-density thrombi and shows a stronger correlation with outcome measures than measurements based on 3 ROIs.
Influence of imaging parameters.
TAI measurements performed on CT scans with thicker slices will be less accurate, because volume averaging results in a reduction of thrombus density on NCCT. Therefore, it has been suggested to only use thin-slice CT images (≤2.5 mm) to measure thrombus perviousness.
Additional permeability measures.
Alternative measures of similar thrombus permeability characteristics have been introduced and are still being introduced. Mishra et al. introduced the residual flow grade, which distinguishes no contrast penetration (grade 0); contrast permeating diffusely through thrombus (grade 1); and tiny hairline lumen or streak of well-defined contrast within the thrombus extending either through its entire length or part of the thrombus (grade 2). 
Clinical relevance.
Currently, treatment for acute ischemic stroke due to an occlusion of one of the arteries of the proximal anterior intracranial circulation consists of intravenous thrombolysis followed by endovascular thrombectomy for patients that arrive at the hospital within 4.5 hours of stroke onset. Patients that arrive later than 4.5 hours after onset, or have contra-indications for intravenous thrombolysis can still be eligible for endovascular thrombectomy only. Even with treatment, not all patients recover after their stroke; many are left with permanent brain damage. Increased thrombus perviousness may decrease brain damage during stroke by allowing more blood to reach the ischemic tissue. Furthermore, level of perviousness may reflect histopathological composition of clots or size of contact surface for thrombolytic medication, thereby influencing effectiveness of thrombolysis.
Thrombus perviousness in research.
A number of studies has been conducted on the effects of thrombus perviousness on NCCT and CTA. In addition, dynamic imaging modalities have been used to investigate thrombus perviousness/permeability in animal and laboratory studies and in humans using digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and CT Perfusion/4D-CTA. 4D-CTA may enable more accurate measurement of TAI, since it overcomes the influence of varying scan timing and contrast arrival in single phase CTA.

William Sladden

William Melville Sladden (13 November 1882 – 12 November 1961) was a South Australian rower. He was a four-time national champion who represented Australia at the 1924 Summer Olympics in the stroke seat of the men's eight.
Pre war rowing.
Sladden's senior rowing was from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. He (and the rest of the champion Murray Bridge senior men's eight) was selected in South Australian state eights to contest the Australian men's interstate eights title at the Interstate Regattas of 1913 and 1914. They won the national title in 1913 and placed second in 1914.
Post war rowing.
Sladden's occupation post war was listed as "Master Mariner" and he returned to competition at the Murray Bridge Rowing Club. The Murray Bridge Rowing Club men's eight continued as the dominant Australian club eight of the 1920s. They won the South Australian state championship from 1920 to 1923 and in 1921 by a margin of ten lengths. For the four years from 1920 to 1923 they were selected in-toto as the South Australian men's eight to contest the King's Cup at the Australian Interstate Regatta. Sladden was the in each of those crews (at stroke in 1920) and rowed in those South Australian King's Cup victories of 1920, 1922 and 1923.
The South Australian media pushed for Sladden's victorious 1920 King's Cup eight to be sent to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics but with the Victorian and New South Wales Rowing Association in control of selections and funding, there wasn't sufficient support for their campaign. By 1924 with South Australia continuing to dominate Australian eights rowing, their claim could not be denied and after winning a test event raced on Port Adelaide in March 1924, Sladden and the South Australian crew were selected in-toto to represent Australia as an eight at the 1924 Summer Olympics.
Funding was raised from the Murray Bridge Rowing Club, the South Australian Rowing Association and the general public of South Australia. The crew were nicknamed "the Murray Cods". Unlike the 1912 Olympic eight, the Murray Cods were not invited to race in lead-up at the Henley Royal Regatta and in 2000 Ted Thomas jnr a crew member's son, asserted that this was because the eight was crewed by working class men other than Sladden It's undisputed that tour funds were scarce and on arrival in France, the crew had to row their shell 60 km to their training base; that on tour a number of the crew (including Sladden) busked as musicians to raise pocket money; and that on race day they first rowed their shell 26 miles from their boatshed to the Olympic course. Their equipment was also sub-par as they rowed with their oars turning in out-rigged poppets rather than in swivelling gates as had become the norm by 1924.
In the Olympic regatta, with Sladden at stroke, the Australian eight finished second behind Italy in their heat, then finished third in the repechage and didn't advance to the final. Sladden did not row on after the Olympics.

The Rocher Lake is a freshwater body of the Broadback River watershed, of the municipality of Eeyou Istchee James Bay (municipality), in the Nord-du-Québec, in Quebec, in Canada.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second with a large downstream navigable body of water, especially the lower Nipukatasi River and the Broadback River.
The hydrographic slope of lake Rocher is accessible via the forest road R1023 (east-west) from the west, passing north of “Île au Pain de Sucre”, then heading north-east to pass from the West of lake Rocher; the R1023 connects the "James Bay Road" (North-South direction) that comes from Matagami. Another road (North-South direction) passes on the east side of Lake Rocher and on the west side of Amisquioumisca Lake.
The surface of Lake Rocher is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
This hydronym evokes the work of life of Robert Rocher, former member of the Geographical Survey of Quebec, in 1917.
The toponym "Lac Rocher" was formalized on December 5, 1968 at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, at the creation of this commission.

Mariya Shkarletova

Mariya Savelyevna Shkarletova (, ; 3 February 1925 – 2 November 2003) was a field medic in the 170th Guards Rifle Regiment during World War II. During the war she participated in offensive operations in Ukraine, Moldova, and Poland for which she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 24 March 1945.
Early life.
Shkarletova was born on 3 February 1925 in Kislovka to a Ukrainian peasant family. After graduating from secondary school she worked in the railroad industry and later on a collective farm until the start of the Second World War, after which she worked in the construction of defensive fortifications until German forces occupied her village in July 1942. Because German troops surrounded the city before she and the rest of her family were evacuated, she was not able to join the Red Army until Soviet troops retook control of the city in July 1943.
Military career.
After the Red Army retook Kupiansk Raion in 1943 Shkarletova joined the army and was sent to brief medical courses in Millerovo. After graduating those courses in October she was deployed in the 170th Guards Rifle Regiment of the 57th Guards Rifle Division. Despite being a medic she participated in direct combat, and on several occasions led her unit in fighting on the Eastern Front. The regiment fought in multiple battles for control of strategic riverbanks on the Dnieper, Ingulets, Dniester, Southern Bug, and Vistula; in the Vistula operation near Warsaw she participated an advance to establish a bridgehead on the right bank under heavy enemy fire. As the only medic of the landing group, she had to run under heavy artillery fire and shelling attacks to provide first aid and carry the wounded to the safety of the forest. She evacuated over 100 wounded under the cover of darkness across the Vistula River for which she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union in March 1945.
Later life.
Shkarletova became a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1946 and graduated from the Kupiansk Medical School in 1949. She actively participated in the reconstruction of the war-torn region employed as a nurse in the Kupiansk District Hospital. Her husband was also a veteran of the Second World War and they raised two daughters. She was later elected as a deputy of the city council and was a member of the Kharkov Red Cross regional committee. In 1965 she was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal for her dedication to rescuing the wounded in the war. She passed away on 2 November 2003 in Kupiansk, Ukraine at the age of 78.

Description.
The carapace of this hermit crab can grow to a length of about . The rostrum is pointed and there is a spine at the tip of the small eye scale. The eye stalks are long and cylindrical and the antennal scales are thorny and nearly cover the bases of the antennae. The chelae (claws) are granulated and covered with short hairs. The left chela is slightly larger than the right one. The walking legs are laterally compressed; the first three pairs are similar in length, the fourth pair are much shorter and the fifth pair end in small claws. The general colour of this crab is orange-red to brown, and the eyes are greyish-blue. A purplish spot at the base of the dactylus is diagnostic of this species.
Distribution and habitat.
"Paguristes eremita" is native to the Mediterranean Sea and adjoining Atlantic Ocean, where its range extends from Portugal to Morocco. Its depth range is and it occurs on sandy stretches of seabed and in seagrass meadows among the Neptune grass.
Ecology.
Like other hermit crabs, "P. eremita" inhabits the empty shell of a gastropod mollusc. It is often associated with the sea anemone "Calliactis parasitica", epizoanthids, hydroids or the sponge "Suberites domuncula" which attach themselves to the shell. The main predators on this crab are loggerhead turtles, larger crustaceans, octopuses and certain fish.
Like other crabs, "P. eremita" is a detritivore. Breeding takes place all year round. The larvae are planktonic and pass through two zoea larval stages and one megalopa stage before undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile hermit crabs.

1944 Hürtgen Forest Museum

The 1944 Hürtgen Forest Museum () is located in Vossenack, in the municipality of Hürtgenwald in the county of Düren in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
The 1944 Hürtgen Forest Peace Museum ("Friedensmuseum Hürtgenwald 1944") was opened on 29 March 1983 in Kleinhau in a stone barn. Its aim was to recall the heavy fighting during the Second World War in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, in which the Americans suffered a costly defeat. In setting up the museum, Konrad Schall from Winden gathered many exhibits: vehicles, documents, uniforms and other artefacts that witness to the battles in the surrounding area.
Later, part of the exhibition was taken over by the municipality from Schall's legacy. They, in turn, transferred it to the Hürtgen Forest History Society ("Geschichtsverein Hürtgenwald"). On 15 September 2001 the present 1944 Hürtgen Forest Museum ("Museum Hürtgenwald 1944 und im Frieden") was opened.
The peace museum is divided into the following themed rooms:

Tatiana Tchernavin

Tatiana Tchernavin (alternative transliteration: Chernavin) (Russian: Чернавин) (1887-1971) was a Russian-born artist who wrote one of the earliest accounts of escaping the Soviet Gulag system, along with her husband Vladimir V. Tchernavin.
Background.
Tatiana Vasilievna Sapozhnikova was born on December 20, 1887, in the Russian Empire. She studied at St. Petersburg University. Tchernavin worked as a curator in the Section of Applied Arts of the Hermitage.
Gulag.
Following several arrests of her husband, Tchernavin herself was arrested in January 1931. On 25 April 1931 her husband was convicted for "wrecking" under Article 58, Paragraph 7 of the Soviet Penal Code and sentenced to five years in Gulag labor camps. They first met again in November 1931, when they began planning to escape from the Soviet Union. In August 1932 they met again and set out on their escape. After 22 days of trekking through rugged terrain and suffering hardships due to a lack of provisions and poor weather, they were finally able to reach Finland. (Tchernavin's son gave an account of the escape, filmed on location in the Russian Arctic, in Angus MacQueen's documentary "Gulag" (2000).)
Life after.
Tchernavin began to write her account of their escape during a period she spent in hospital recovering from the adverse effects of the journey on a heart condition. The book was published first in London in October 1933. The Tchernavins were still living in Finland in 1933, but in April of that year a letter from her husband, entitled "Methods of the OGPU", was published in "The Times".
The letter was a rebuttal from his personal experience of the statement by Andrey Vyshinsky at the then current trial in Moscow of Metropolitan-Vickers engineers that '...in U.S.S.R. the accused are not put to torture...'. A subsequent letter from Sir Bernard Pares strongly suggests that Pares had helped to bring about their publication. In March 1934 Pares presided at Tatiana's public lecture in London, entitled "The fate of the intellectual worker in Soviet Russia".
In 1934, the family moved to England. Tchernavin became a translator in the UK Ministry of Information for the remainder of World War II and helped subtitle Noël Coward's war propaganda film "In Which We Serve". Andrei became a civil engineer and designed the Bow Flyover.
Personal life and death.
Tchernavin married Vladimir V. Tchernavin (1887–1949), who graduated from the same university. They had one child, Andrei Vladimirovich Tchernavin (1918–2007).
Tchernavin died age 83 on March 1, 1971, in England. Tchernavin, her husband, and son are all interred at the St. Mary Churchyard in South Perrott, West Dorset District, Dorset, England.
Legacy.
Tchernavin's "Escape From The Soviets" (1934) and her husband's book "I Speak for the Silent: Prisoners of the Soviets" (1935) were among the first to give testimony of life under the Soviets, the GPU's operations and the Gulag.

Victoria Hernández

Victoria Hernández (March 23, 1897 – April 11, 1998) was an Afro-Puerto Rican music entrepreneur. Though a talented musician, she devoted her career to the business aspects of the music industry. In 1927, she opened the first Latin music store in New York City, one of only sixteen businesses owned by Puerto Rican migrant women. She served as an agent to locate music talent for record labels and bandleaders and at one point owned her own record label. After following her brother to Mexico City, Hernández returned to the Bronx and founded "Casa de Música", later renamed to Casa Hernández. The music store she founded in 1941, now known as Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernandez has the longest record of continuous operation of any music store in New York City.
Early life.
Victoria Hernández was born on March 23, 1897 in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico to María Hernández Marín and José Miguel Rosa Espinoza. Her parents were Afro-Puerto Rican tobacco workers and her father was a talented guitarist. The oldest daughter in the family, all of her siblings Rafael (1891/92-1965), Jesús "Pocholo" (1899–1982) and Rosa Elvira (1905–?) would become accomplished musicians. They were encouraged by their maternal grandmother, who lived with the family, to study music and Victoria became a skilled cellist, violinist and pianist.
Career.
In 1919, Hernández moved with her mother, grandmother and siblings to New York City and began work as a factory seamstress, who gave piano lessons to generate additional income. Within eight years, in 1927, she and her brothers bought a store, located at 1735 Madison Avenue in East Harlem. The store, "Almacenes Hernández" (Hernández Music Store), the first "Puerto Rican–owned music store in New York City", carried records and guitars, as well as music rolls for player pianos. In the back rooms, Hernández gave music lessons to students like Tito Puente and Loco Esteves and her brother Rafael composed music. In the era, it was unacceptable for respectable Latina women to perform as popular musicians, so though ostensibly owned by the siblings, Victoria ran the business to support the family and give her brothers an income so that they could devote their time to composing and performing. According to the historian Virginia Sánchez Korrol, at the time Hernández was one of only sixteen Puerto Rican women operating businesses in the United States.
In 1927, Hernández added her own recording label, "Hispano" to her enterprises. Her label produced several records for "Las Estrellas Boricuas" and "Los Diablos de la Plena", two groups known in the Puerto Rican music community, as well as songs composed by Rafael, including his now well-known song, "Pura Flama". She successfully sold many records until her bank failed as a result of the Great Depression, forcing her to close the label in 1929. As her business grew, Hernández needed more space and relocated to 1724 Madison Avenue in 1930. In 1932, Rafael formed a group, which he named "Cuarteto Victoria" (Victoria Quartet) in her honor. Hernández served as his booking agent and organized his tours and recording sessions. To contest the stereotype that musicians were irresponsible bohemians, Hernández insisted that the quartet forego the traditional costumes featuring ruffled-sleeve shirts and instead wear suits and ties. As she gained a reputation, Hernández began working with record labels like Columbia Records, Decca and Victor to book instrumentalists for recording sessions and with bandleaders like Xavier Cugat, who were searching for musicians. Hernández also often assisted the musicians themselves by advancing them money in exchange for a cut of their later earnings. Her benevolence earned her the honorific "La Madrina" (the godmother) from some, but also less flattering titles by those who felt her charges were usurious.
The Hernández siblings sold "Almacenes Hernández" to the Verne Records owner, Luis Cuevas in 1939 and both Rafael and Victoria moved from the United States. After first going to Puerto Rico and reforming the group "Cuarteto Victoria", they recorded and performed in Curaçao and the toured in Colombia, Panama, New York and Mexico before settling in Mexico City in 1940. After unsuccessfully trying to restart her business in Mexico, Hernández returned to New York City and in 1941, moved into the Manhanset Building at 786 Prospect Avenue in The Bronx. She opened another music store on the ground floor of the building, known as "Casa de Música" (House of Music). As before, her brother Rafael was listed as one of the owners, however, he remained in Mexico City through the 1940s and Victoria ran the business. She sold instruments, records and sheet music, but also carried men's suits, women's fashions and hats and gave music lessons for extra income. The variety of items were not uncommon at the time, as exclusive stores specializing in only one product did not emerge until the late part of the 1940s.
Hernández soon renamed the business as "Casa Hernández" and operated it until 1965 when Rafael died. Losing interest in the venture upon his death, she hired Johnny Cabán to manage the store for the next four years. In 1969 Hernández sold the store to Miguel Angel "Mike" Amadeo. He renamed the store Casa Amadeo, antigua Casa Hernández, retaining the historic ties to the Hernández siblings. Still in operation, the store has the longest record of continuous operation of any music store in New York City. After she sold the store, Hernández became the companion of Gabriel Oller, another music entrepreneur who owned the second Puerto Rican music store opened in New York, the Spanish Music Center. Hernández remained in Manhattan until the 1980s.
Death and legacy.
Hernández died on April 11, 1998 in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico and was buried in Rafael's tomb in the Santa María Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery of Old San Juan. Hernández's career is evidence of the ways in which women in her era took on both traditional roles as caretakers but managed to live in nontraditional ways by becoming involved in business.

Kommern Open Air Museum

The Kommern Open Air Museum () and Rhenish State Museum for Folk Art ("Rheinische Landesmuseum für Volkskunde") in Kommern/Eifel is one of the largest open air museums in Europe, covering an area of over 95 hectares and displaying around 67 historic buildings from the Prussian Rhine Province. It is operated by the Rhineland Regional Association ("Landschaftsverband Rheinland", LVR).
History.
The planning for an open-air museum in the Rhineland dates back to the 1950s. Approximately 30 cities, towns and villages between Aachen, Cologne and the Ruhr area, including Duisburg, Krefeld, Rheydt and Kommern (today part of Mechernich, but still independent at that time) applied for the privilege. The selection of Kommern on 28 March 1958 in a run-off election against Krefeld is said to have been thanks to the work of Kommern's Norbert Leduc. The museum was opened on 20 July 1961. Its leaders have been Adelhart Zippelius (to 1981), Dieter Pesch (1981 to 2007) and Josef Mangold (2008 - present).
Museum.
Around 67 buildings, including farmyards, wind mills, workshops, village community buildings like schools, bakehouses, dancing halls and chapels, all of which originated on the territory of the former Prussian Rhine Province and its predecessors, have been gathered together in four groups. Arable fields, vegetable gardens and orchards complete the picture. The exhibits come predominantly from the Westerwald/Middle Rhine region, from the Eifel mountains and Voreifel foothills, from the Lower Rhine and from the Bergisches Land. They portray everyday life from the 15th century. Under construction is another group of buildings the "Rhineland Market Place" ("Marktplatz Rheinland"), which will illustrate the rural and small town life of the Rhineland, both at home and work, from the 1950s to the 1980s. With that the Kommern Open Air Museum will also become a museum of everyday culture of life in the 20th century.
In addition the museum has permanent and changing exhibitions in its role as the Rhenish State Museum for Folk Culture ("Rheinisches Landesmuseum für Volkskunde").
The Kommern Open Air Museum has an annual programme with around 70 special events. Major events are the "Jahrmarkt anno dazumal" ("Annual Market in the Year Dot"), which takes place from Easter Saturday to White Sunday, the "Zeitblende" ("Time Window"), which looks back 50 years to the Rhineland and the wider world, "Nach der Ernte" ("After the Harvest") on 3rd or 4th weekend in September and "Advent für alle Sinne" ("Advent for All Senses") in the first week of Advent.
A focal point for the museum is its living history programme. Under the motto "Gespielte Geschichte" ("History in Action"), actors meet the visitors in the first person as historically identifiable people or as everyday folk from a particular time and social situation and "draw" the museum guests into the past.
Permanent exhibitions.
WirRheinländer ("We Rhinelanders")
In this exhibition the history of the Rhineland and the live of the Rhinelanders is portrayed from the time of the French occupation in 1794 to the start of the economic miracle after 1950. The visitor walks through a historical avenue in an exhibition hall with more than 50 replica buildings from the Rhineland, in which scenarios about Rhenish history are presented.
In addition, there are several changing exhibitions.
Photography ban.
There is a "de facto" ban on photography in the museum. Private photography is permitted in principle, but any publication of photos and videos, even on non-commercial platforms, is forbidden.

1962 Boston College Eagles football team

The 1962 Boston College Eagles football team represented Boston College as an independent during the 1962 NCAA University Division football season. The team compiled an 8–2 record and outscored opponents by a total of 250 to 123.
In January 1962, Jim Miller was signed to a three-year contract as the team's head coach. Miller had led the Detroit Titans football team to an 18–10 record from 1959 to 1961. The Eagles opened their 1962 season with a 27–0 victory over Miller's old team.
The team's defense gave up only 236.2 yards of total offense per game, a figure that ranks fourth best in school history. The defense also recorded a school record 26 interceptions (45 total turnovers) in only 10 games.
The Eagles' sole losses were to Syracuse (0–12) and Navy (6–26). Navy's sophomore quarterback Roger Staubach threw two touchdown passes against Boston College. In the team's October 27 victory over Houston, the defense set a single-game record by allowing the Cougars to gain only 72 yards of total offense.
The team played its home games at Alumni Stadium in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.
Individual statistics and awards.
Quarterback Jack Concannon completed 97 of 181 passes for 1,450 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, and six interceptions. Concannon's 15 touchdown passes tied for the most among NCAA major college players.
End Art Graham was the team captain and led the team with 823 receiving yards and 42 points scored. His 823 receiving yards set a Boston College, single-season record that stood for Graham also 21 years. Graham also received the Thomas F. Scanlan Memorial Trophy as the senior player outstanding in scholarship, leadership, and athletic ability.
The team's other statistical leaders included fullback Harry Crump with 641 rushing yards and Jim McGowan with seven interceptions and 182 interception return yards. McGowan's 182 return yards remains a Boston College, single-season record. McGowan also set the school's single-game record with 136 interception return yards (on two returns for touchdowns) against Texas Tech on November 10, 1962.
Two Eagles (Harry Crump and Art Graham) were named to the 1962 All-East football team selected based on voting conducted by the Eastern College Athletic Conference. Three Eagles (Crump, Graham, and guard Lou Cioci) were also named to the 1962 All-New England football team; quarterback Jack Concannon and end Dave O'Brien were named to the second team.

John Aldridge (British politician)

Lieutenant-Colonel John Aldridge (4 January 1832 – 23 February 1888) was a British soldier, Conservative Party politician, and landowner in Sussex.
Family.
Aldridge was the son of Robert Aldridge and Caroline Anne, daughter of Charles George Beauclerk. He was married in 1863 to Mary Alethea, daughter of Samuel Matthews, and together they had five children:
Military career.
Aldridge served in the Royal Scots Fusiliers, rising to the rank of Captain in the regiment on 29 December 1854 and Brevet Major in the army on 6 June 1856. After his brief political career he was appointed Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant of the part-time Royal Sussex Light Infantry Militia (later the 3rd and 4th battalions of Royal Sussex Regiment) on 27 October 1875.
Political career.
He was elected MP for Horsham in 1868 alongside Robert Henry Hurst. This was unusual as the seat was only eligible to send one member. Although both candidates were declared elected, petitions were lodged against them both, and on 3 May 1869 Aldridge withdrew his claim to entitlement to the seat, leaving Hurst as the sole MP.
St Leonard's House.
Aldridge inherited the St Leonard's Forest estate, near Horsham, from his father, Robert Aldridge, in 1871. After 1878, he began selling land from the estate, perhaps due to the agricultural recession. Upon his death in 1888, the estate passed to his son, Robert Beauclerk Aldridge.
Other activities.
He was also a Justice of the Peace and a Deputy Lieutenant for Sussex.

Dromore Viaduct

The Dromore Viaduct is an abandoned railway viaduct in Dromore, County Down, Northern Ireland.
Design.
The viaduct crosses the River Lagan. It is roughly 101m long and 6m wide, having been built to carry only a single track. The viaduct consists of seven arches, 10m apart, with the piers being 1.5m wide. The piers and abutments are made of ashlar blackstone, whilst the parapets, which stand a metre above arch level, are coped with chamfered sandstone. The viaduct stands at 23 metres tall.
It was designed by Thomas Jackson of Messrs Greene &amp; King, who built the line from Knockmore to Banbridge. Jackson was also responsible for designing Hillsborough and Dromore railway stations.
History.
Construction began in 1860 and was completed the following year, opening to railway traffic in 1863 with the first train on 13 July that year. Originally owned by the Banbridge, Lisburn and Belfast Junction Railway (Whose trains were run by the Ulster Railway), it became part of the Great Northern Railway in 1876. The line, and thus the viaduct, was closed on 30 April 1956 and the tracks lifted shortly after.
In 2009, the PSNI was called to the viaduct after a group of teenagers broke onto and bungee jumped from it.
Today.
The viaduct is a listed building and has been since 1977. It is the property of Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council. Dromore Town Park passes underneath two of the arches, though the ends have both been sealed off from public access. Floodlights have been installed under the arches and it is common to see it lit up blue overnight.

Pagurus forbesii

Pagurus forbesii is a species of hermit crab in the family Paguridae. It is found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea.
Taxonomy.
This species was first described by the English zoologist Thomas Bell, writing in the publication "A history of British Crustacea IV". Although the year is usually given as 1846, the part of this publication concerned was actually published in the last week of 1845. The type locality was Falmouth in England. Later in 1846, the French zoologist Hippolyte Lucas described "Pagurus sculptimanus" from Oran, and this was later determined to be a synonym of "P. forbesii".
Description.
The genus "Pagurus" consist of around 170 species including 13 found in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Of these 13, "Pagurus forbesii" and "Pagurus cuanensis" are distinctive in having long eyestalks, and the males have characteristic pleopods numbered 2 to 5 on the left. The carapace can grow to a length of about . The right chela (claw) is hairy and somewhat granulated; the propodus (penultimate segment) has a depression on either side of a long ridge that extends onto the dactylus. The visible portions of this hermit crab are reddish yellow, with darker spotting being present on the abdomen.
Distribution and habitat.
"Pagurus forbesii" occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, its depth range being . It inhabits sandy seabeds with coarse and medium-sized grains, as well as coral rubble.
Ecology.
Like other hermit crabs, "P. forbesii" uses the empty shells of gastropod molluscs to live in. This crab has been found inhabiting shells of the cornet ("Cerithium vulgatum"), the thick-lipped dogwhelk ("Tritia incrassata"), the common tower shell ("Turritella communis") and "Ocinebrina aciculata". The sea anemone "Adamsia palliata" often lives on the shell occupied by a hermit crab; usually this is a shell used by "Pagurus prideaux", but in the Bay of Naples in Italy, about 8% of the shells occupied by "P. forbesii" were found to be colonised by the sea anemone.
Three species of hermit crab were found to be present in a bay near Cadiz in southern Spain. "Paguristes eremita" were the biggest and positively selected the largest and most robust available gastropod shells. "Diogenes pugilator" and "P. forbesii" occupied similar-size, lighter shells, but despite being much more abundant, "D. pugilator" tended not to inhabit the commonest shell "Turritella turbona", while "P. forbesii" seemed to preferentially select them. On occasions, "D. pugilator" continued to inhabit a shell whose aperture it had outgrown, while "P. forbesii" and "P. eremita" moved on to larger shells as they grew.

Noli me tangere (Sustris)

Noli me tangere or Christ Appearing As A Gardener To Mary Magdalene is a 1548-1560 painting by the Flemish painter Lambert Sustris. It is now in the Palais des beaux-arts de Lille.
It shows the eponymous scene from the Gospel of John, set in a Renaissance-style garden with geometric parterres, a fountain, a covered passageway and a cloister. Wearing a sumptuous gold and silver damask robe, Mary Magdalene kneels before Christ, holding her left hand to her breast and her right on an alabaster vase. He leans on a hoe and points to the sky, whilst a white bindweed around the trunk of the tree behind him symbolises the fall of sin. A woman's shadow stretches along the passageway, possibly symbolising Mary's spreading the news of the Resurrection to the Twelve Apostles.
History.
It was produced during Sustris' first or second stay in Augsburg, probably for count Fugger of Kirschberg and Weissenhorn, whose coat of arms are in the bottom left of the work. Around the time of his stay there the artist assimilated the Italian style and combined the Venetian style with the mannerism of Francesco Salviati and Parmigianino. This and other works of that period by him show the influence of Titian, with whom Sustris had collaborated since 1540, and anticipated Paolo Veronese's 1560s compositions.
It was then acquired by a rich banker and collector, Everhard Jabach, who sold it to Louis XIV in 1671. Louis put it in the Salon des Bassans at the château de Versailles, near the entrance to his bedroom. After the Chaptal Decree of 1801 the French state assigned the painting (then attributed to Dosso Dossi) to the museum in Lille. It was re-attributed to Sustris between 1801 and 1835.

INTERFET logistics

The logistical support of the multinational International Force East Timor (INTERFET) peacekeeping mission in 1999 and 2000 involved, at its peak, 11,693 personnel from 23 countries. Of these 5,697 were from Australia, making it the largest deployment of Australian forces overseas since the Vietnam War. INTERFET was unusual in that it was led by Australia, casting the country in a wholly unfamiliar role. The logistics and support areas of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) had been subject to deep cuts in the 1990s. The ADF had not anticipated being committed to such a large peacekeeping mission, and was unprepared to support an Australian force projection of this size, much less act as lead nation of an international coalition.
INTERFET deployed to East Timor in September 1999. Over 90 per cent of the cargo and most of the passengers travelled by sea, transported by a naval task force. Eleven nations contributed transport aircraft to the INTERFET Coalition Airlift Wing (ICAW), which flew 3,400 sorties in support of INTERFET, carried of cargo and transported more than 30,000 passengers. A base was established in Darwin, with supplies, equipment, stores and in many cases personnel stockpiled or staged there before being dispatched to East Timor by sea or air.
East Timor posed significant challenges for logistical support. There was only one deepwater port, Dili, and it had a maximum quayside depth of just . There were few beaches suitable for Logistics Over-the-Shore (LOTS) and just three airfields. To give effect to an operational concept that involved flooding East Timor with as many combat troops as possible, troops were initially landed with a minimum of vehicles and supplies. The logistical support units spent October and November catching up and eliminating backlogs. Effective logistical support enabled INTERFET to carry out its mission without severe limitations resulting from inadequate logistics, although there were shortages of spare parts, medical supplies and amenities.
Background.
The island of Timor, in the Indonesian archipelago, has been populated for up to 40,000 years, occupied by successive waves of immigrants from southern India, Malaysia and Melanesia. It was ruled by small kingdoms that traded spices, slaves and sandalwood with their neighbours. Portugal established a settlement on the eastern part of the island in 1633. Timor was formally divided between the Netherlands and Portugal in 1661, and the first governor of Portuguese Timor was appointed in 1701. For most of the next three centuries, East Timor was a Portuguese colony. During the Second World War, East Timor was occupied by Australian and Dutch forces, and then invaded by the Japanese on 19 February 1942. Sparrow Force, the Australian commandos and Dutch troops on the island, waged a guerrilla campaign until the Australian and Dutch forces were withdrawn in January 1943. The assistance of the East Timorese people in helping the Australians created a bond between Australia and East Timor that became part of popular mythology in Australia. After the war ended, Timor was occupied by Australia, which supported Indonesian independence from the Netherlands, and proposed that East Timor become a United Nations (UN) trusteeship, but backed down in the face of objections from the United Kingdom.
After its April 1974 Carnation Revolution, Portugal initiated a gradual decolonisation process, and East Timor descended into a civil war between supporters of the Timorese Democratic Union (UDT) and Fretilin. In October 1974, Indonesia began military operations to incorporate East Timor. Fretilin unilaterally declared independence on 28 November 1975 in an attempt to forestall this, but on 7 December Indonesian forces invaded East Timor. Indonesia's annexation of East Timor was recognised by Australia and the United States, but not by Portugal or the UN. Most countries regarded it as a "UN-designated non-self-governing territory" under Indonesian control. Following a UN-brokered agreement between Indonesia and Portugal on 5 May 1999, a referendum was held on 30 August 1999 that offered a choice between autonomy within Indonesia and full independence. The people voted overwhelmingly for the latter. A violent scorched earth policy was then carried out by pro-Indonesia militia, supported by elements of the Indonesian National Armed Forces (TNI).
The United States declined to intervene in East Timor. There were concerns about the economic and political consequences of a conflict with Indonesia. Americans felt that in the Bosnian War the United States had carried out most of the risky missions and paid the bulk of the bills, and that its allies should do more. The 1999 Helms-Biden Act restricted the United States' ability to provide military support to the UN. On 15 September United Nations Security Council Resolution 1264 established an Australian-led and Indonesian-sanctioned peacekeeping force, INTERFET, to take all necessary measures to restore order in East Timor. The President of the United States, Bill Clinton, offered to "contribute to the force in a limited, but essential, way – including communications and logistical aid, intelligence, air lifts of personnel and material and coordination of the humanitarian response to the tragedy". This meant the United States would play the unfamiliar role of a subordinate member of a military coalition, while Australia played the equally unfamiliar one of lead nation. Neither country's doctrine, based on NATO publications, provided for this contingency.
East Timor posed significant challenges. There was only one deepwater port, Dili, and it had a maximum quayside depth of just , greatly limiting its cargo capacity, as the average draught of a 1,000-TEU container ship is about . There were few beaches suitable for Logistics Over-the-Shore (LOTS), and just three airfields. The mountainous interior was characterised by steep, narrow and poorly maintained roads susceptible to being cut by flooding during the wet season. A geographical complication was posed by the Oecussi enclave, which was physically separate from the rest of East Timor. The population was poor, and much infrastructure had been damaged or destroyed, so little host nation support could be provided, and INTERFET had to be entirely self-supporting. The intention was that logistics would remain a national responsibility, each nation being responsible for the logistical support of its own element. In reality, Australia, in its role of lead nation, was called upon to provide all those capabilities not provided by the other members of the coalition. Most of these were in the combat support and combat service support areas.
A decade of defence cuts in the 1990s had fallen disproportionately on the logistics and support areas of the Australian Defence Force (ADF), as the leadership attempted to preserve combat capability. This was compounded by a defence policy of the Howard Government that sought to maximise the tooth-to-tail ratio. On 11 March 1999, the Minister for Defence, John Moore, announced that administrative cuts had permitted an increase in readiness, so that the Australian Army's Darwin-based 1st Brigade could be brought to 28 days' notice to deploy, the same as the Townsville-based 3rd Brigade. This, he claimed, would allow for a two-brigade deployment to a trouble spot in the Asia-Pacific region at short notice, East Timor being specifically mentioned as a possibility, but the very same cuts rendered this impossible. While they provided short-term financial benefits, far from increasing operational capability, in the words of Lieutenant Colonel David Beaumont "the preferential allocation of resources to combat capabilities and the acceptance of risk in logistics functions brought the Army to the precipice of operational failure."
Planning.
Australia.
During July and August 1999, the head of the Australian Army's Strategic Command, Major General Michael Keating, placed elements of the ADF on reduced notice to move. Logistical staffs in Canberra, Sydney and Brisbane were aware of this, but were not authorised to top up units and depots with stocks, purchase necessary special equipment, or pre-position units, vehicles, equipment or supplies. Such actions could be easily discovered, and that might have strained the already tense relations between Australia and Indonesia. Brigadier Mark Evans, the commander of the 3rd Brigade, held a secret meeting of his subordinate commanders at his headquarters in Townsville on 22 August. Lieutenant Colonel Mick Kehoe, the commander of the 10th Force Support Battalion (10 FSB), was not one of Evans's subordinates; his unit was part of Brigadier Jeff Wilkinson's Logistic Support Force, which was based in Sydney. Nonetheless, he attended this and subsequent conferences regarding the deployment to East Timor with Wilkinson's blessing.
Air Vice Marshal Robert Treloar, the Commander Australian Theatre (COMAST), delegated responsibility for developing plans for Operation Spitfire, the evacuation of foreign nationals and selected East Timorese, to Major General Peter Cosgrove's Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (DJFHQ) in Brisbane. Its logistics staff was headed by Lieutenant Colonel Don Cousins. Planning sessions were attended by Wilkinson's senior plans officer, Major Cliff Cole, and Major Jim Evans, who had seen six months' active service with the British Army's logistic headquarters in the Bosnian War, was detached from command of an Australian Army Reserve transport squadron to serve as Wilkinson's liaison officer at DJFHQ.
The Logistic Support Force was not designed to manage the logistic support of forces deployed away from Australia; its mission was to command the Army's field force logistic units, and it was in the midst of a reorganisation in 1999. Wilkinson anticipated being designated the Logistic Component Commander for Operation Spitfire, responsible for coordinating the logistics of all three services, but this did not occur until 26 August, the day before the first troops began deploying to northern Australia for the operation. To support Operation Spitfire, Kehoe detached a small group of specialists under Captain Phil MacMaster to work with Lieutenant Colonel Steve Kinloch's 3rd Brigade Administrative Support Battalion (3 BASB). He later admitted that this was a mistake, costing him the services of key personnel for several weeks.
On 6 September, the day after Operation Spitfire began, Wilkinson received official notice of Operation Warden, the multinational intervention in East Timor. The codename Operation Stabilise was given to operations in and around East Timor, while Operation Warden also included logistic support activities in Australia. At the same time he was relieved of responsibility for logistical support of Crocodile 99, the major joint US-Australian military exercises at the Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area in north Queensland scheduled to commence in October. Operation Spitfire was carried out between 6 and 14 September, during which some 2,500 civilians were evacuated from East Timor to Darwin by air. Planning for Operation Warden commenced on 8 September.
New Zealand.
In New Zealand, the Chief of Defence Force, Air Marshal Carey Adamson, issued a directive on 23 June that initiated preparations for New Zealand participation in East Timor, which was given the codename Operation Castall. A New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) joint planning group was created, headed by Air Commodore John Hamilton, but, as in Australia, planning was hampered by political sensitivities regarding Indonesia. Adamson decided to order an infantry company, with helicopters and support elements, to be on 28 days' readiness to move. The New Zealand cabinet authorised the funding required to bring 25 M113 armoured personnel carriers (APCs) up to operational readiness. Liaison officers were sent to Australia in August, including one to Australian Theatre in Sydney, where he observed logistical preparations. Colonel Martyn Dunne, a graduate of the Australian Defence College, was chosen to head the forward planning team due to his familiarity with the ADF and operational experience.
It was soon determined that the ADF could provide little assistance with logistics, and in fact was looking to New Zealand for assistance with airlift and sealift, and medical services. A mutual logistics support agreement between the ADF and NZDF was signed in late September. The joint planning group resolved to make the New Zealand force as self-sufficient as possible, and that it would take 60 days' supplies with it. As East Timor had no facilities for handling containers, special container handling cranes were designed and manufactured in New Zealand. The joint planning group calculated that moving a battalion group to Darwin or Dili would require chartering two merchant ships, each of about capacity. Merchant shipping available for charter in New Zealand was scarce but two suitable ships were eventually found. A Boeing 747 freighter was leased to transport high priority cargo to Darwin. In one flight it carried of cargo, including seven four-wheel-drive vehicles. MV "Edamgracht", the first of the chartered vessels, departed Wellington on 30 September. It was followed by the MV "Edisongracht", which departed on 18 October. The two carried 120 vehicles or pieces of plant, and of cargo in 100 containers. They arrived at Darwin on 12 and 19 October, where they were unloaded by the same terminal operations platoon that had loaded them.
Organisation.
Wilkinson and Cousins agreed that a base at Darwin, south east of Timor, was required to support Operation Spitfire and subsequent operations. The limitations of Darwin's air and sea ports, its facilities for the storage and distribution of supplies, and its information and communications networks, were not overlooked, but at the same time, due to its isolation, Darwin was more self-supporting, and had better facilities than other cities of similar size. The ADF's long-standing presence in the vicinity had engendered close relationships with the local government and community. On 28 August, Wilkinson appointed Lieutenant Colonel Barry McManus, the commander of the 9th Force Support Battalion (9 FSB), to head the Force Logistic Support Group (FLSG) for Operation Spitfire at Northern Command (NORCOM) Headquarters in Darwin. Commodore Mark Bonser's NORCOM was an operational headquarters that was responsible for the planning and conduct of operations to the north of Australia, and was normally focused on regional surveillance. Brigadier Bruce Osborn, the Army's Director General of Career Management, located suitable ADF officers to fill out the staffs at FLSG and DJFHQ. The outsourcing of "non-core" logistical functions in the ADF had created critical shortages of many essential trades ranging from cooks to port terminal handlers, as many of these jobs were no longer performed by military personnel.
The Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Chris Barrie, centralised strategic and operational planning for the projection of forces to East Timor at ADF Headquarters, bypassing the service chiefs in their role as senior environmental advisors. Treloar was appointed the Australian national commander, and Wilkinson became the Logistics Component Commander (LOGCC). Commodore Jim Stapleton was appointed Maritime Component Commander (MCC), and Air Commodore Roxley McLennan became the Air Component Commander (ACC). Stapleton was "dual-hatted"; as MCC (Commander, Task Group 645.1), he was answerable to Cosgrove (Commander, Task Force 645); but as Commodore Flotillas (COMFLOT) (Task Group 627.1), he reported to COMAST's Maritime Commander, Rear Admiral John Lord (Commander, Task Force 627). Brigadier General John G. Castellaw, USMC, the commanding general of the 3rd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, was appointed commander of US forces (USFORINTERFET). The 35-person USFORINTERFET staff arrived in Darwin on 20 September. On 19 September, Barrie announced:
The 10th Force Support Battalion had been formed on 1 March 1998 from the amalgamation of the 10th Terminal Regiment, 2nd Field Logistics Battalion, 1st Division Postal Unit and the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre (DNSDC) Watercraft Base Repair Detachment. It was based in the Townsville area, except for the 36th Water Transport Troop in Darwin. Its sub-units included the 30th/35th Water Transport and Terminal Squadron, 26th Combat Supply Company and 2nd Equipment Company. Along with its main role of providing general (third line) support to operations, the 10th Force Support Battalion had also been charged with providing fourth-line logistic support in northern Queensland. It, therefore, consisted of a mix of deployable and non-deployable components. The 2nd Equipment Company was a non-deployable unit with significant numbers of civilians, and the 26th Combat Supplies Company, which was responsible for classes of supply I (food and potable water), III (petrol, oil and lubricants (POL)) and V (ammunition), also contained many.
No plans had been drawn up to cover a contingency in which the battalion had to deploy overseas. In November 1999, the Chief of Army, Lieutenant General Frank Hickling, announced that the 10th Force Support Battalion would be relieved of its responsibility for northern Queensland from November 2000. In the meantime, it was split in two, the 10th Force Support Battalion (INTERFET) deploying to East Timor and the 10th Force Support Battalion (Rear) remaining in northern Queensland under the command of Major Max Walker, the commander of the 2nd Equipment Company.
The ADF had not anticipated commitment to such a large peacekeeping mission, and borrowed 4,000 flak jackets from US stocks. These were taken from the Defense Supply Center, Columbus, and flown to Darwin via Chicago and Melbourne. Depot stocks of many items were low, due to an over-reliance on just-in-time delivery, a problem that also affected the NZDF. Demonstrating their assessment of the logistical support they expected to receive in East Timor, soldiers preparing to deploy emptied their local supermarket shelves of items such as sun screen, razor blades, toothpaste and hair nets. Each soldier's personnel file was checked to confirm their fitness to deploy. An important concern was the regime for the vaccine for Japanese encephalitis, a disease endemic to East Timor, which required three injections over a four-week period, with a prohibition against air travel for ten days after the last.
Deployment.
Airlift.
McLennan had at his disposal 13 Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Lockheed C-130H Hercules transport aircraft of No. 86 Wing RAAF Detachment B based at RAAF Base Amberley, RAAF Base Darwin and RAAF Base Tindal, under the command of Squadron Leader Simon Giles. This was augmented by two C-130Hs of the No. 40 Squadron, Royal New Zealand Air Force (RNZAF), with six crews, and a single C-130H with two crews and ten maintenance personnel from the US 517th Airlift Squadron. Normally based at Elmendorf Air Force Base in Alaska, it had been supporting the visit to New Zealand by President Clinton for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. This contribution was subsequently increased to four C-130Hs, with 20 aircrew and 33 maintenance personnel, the additional aircraft and personnel being drawn from the 613th Air Expeditionary Group.
The first INTERFET troops to arrive in East Timor were the INTERFET Response Force, consisting of members of the Australian Special Air Service Regiment, New Zealand Special Air Service and the British Special Boat Service, who left Darwin in five RAAF and RNZAF C-130Hs on 20 September. They landed at Dili's Comoro Airport, which was quickly secured. This allowed C-130Hs from Townsville carrying the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) and two M113 armoured personnel carriers from the 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment to land. That day, C-130s flew 33 sorties and transported 1,500 troops to East Timor. A company of Gurkhas from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Gurkha Rifles, arrived in the early hours of 21 September, and took over responsibility for guarding the UNAMET compound from the INTERFET Response Force.
The Dili heliport was found abandoned, but not burnt or seriously damaged. Twelve Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters of the Townsville-based 5th Aviation Regiment flew direct from Darwin to the heliport, albeit with ships carefully pre-positioned along their route in case any had to make an emergency landing. They were augmented by three Bell UH-1 Iroquois helicopters from No. 3 Squadron RNZAF on 26 September. This was increased to six aircraft in mid-October. Also deployed to East Timor were the Bell OH-58 Kiowa helicopters of the Army's 162nd Reconnaissance Squadron, three Beechcraft Super King Air aircraft of the 173rd Aviation Squadron, and a detachment of four DHC-4 Caribou transports from No. 86 Wing RAAF Detachment B began arriving on 10 October. INTERFET deployed a total of 49 aircraft to East Timor.
An air traffic control team headed by Squadron Leader George Christianson arrived from Townsville on the seventh aircraft to arrive at Dili with the 3rd Brigade staff, but without communications equipment. Christianson went to the control tower and explained, through an interpreter since he did not speak Indonesian, that he was a traffic controller, and joined the TNI personnel there, using their radios. No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron RAAF assumed responsibility for the operation of the airport at Dili, while No. 382 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron RAAF operated Cakung Airport at Baucau. The two squadrons were part of the No. 395 Expeditionary Combat Support Wing RAAF. No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron RAAF provided security for the airports, which were secured by 2 RAR on 22 September. The RAAF was short of aircraft loaders, so they were augmented by two six-person RNZAF teams: one in Darwin and one in Dili, which joined the 22 RAAF loaders there.
The INTERFET Combined Air Wing (ICAW) remained based in Darwin. It was augmented by three French Air Force C-130Hs, which commenced operations from Darwin on 22 September, and two 436 Transport Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force, CC-130s. The Canadian aircraft arrived in Townsville, along with an air movements section and a maintenance section, from their base in Trenton, Ontario, on 20 September before moving on to Darwin on 27 September. A British Royal Air Force (RAF) detachment of four C-130K Hercules arrived before 20 September, but two were withdrawn on 23 September, and a third on 1 November, reducing the RAF contingent to a lone aircraft. The RAF had a run of bad luck that included one Hercules that suffered damage to a nose wheel tyre at Dili on 20 October, and another that blew a tyre during a three-engine landing at Darwin on 21 October. In October they were joined by two Fiat G222s from the Italian Air Force, a C-130H Hercules from 601 Transport Squadron of the Royal Thai Air Force, and three Transall C-160 aircraft of the German Air Force. The eleven-nation ICAW flew 3,400 sorties in support of INTERFET, carried of cargo and transported more than 30,000 passengers.
Sealift.
Nonetheless, 91.7 per cent of the cargo by weight and 93.2 per cent by volume, and most of the passengers arrived in East Timor by sea. A naval task force consisting of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) landing ship , landing craft , and , and the replenishment oiler , escorted by the frigates , , and , weighed anchor in Darwin on 18 September, and set out for East Timor, its arrival on 20 September coinciding with the airlift. The cruiser , tanker , and Australian frigate , were already in waters around East Timor. "Endeavour" carried aviation fuel, and was a particularly valuable asset as the RAN's other oiler, , was still out of action as a result of a fire in 1998.
The RAN's landing ships and , purchased in 1994, were still being refitted, and were unavailable. To compensate for the delay in bringing them into service, the RAN had bareboat chartered a high-speed catamaran, , on 10 June 1999. On 21 September, "Jervis Bay" arrived at Dili with 541 paratroopers from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment. RAN Clearance Diving Team Four carried out a reconnaissance of the harbour, and landing craft from "Tobruk" delivered troopers and 29 ASLAVs of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. HMAS "Tobruk" made four return trips from Darwin to East Timor after the initial landing, bringing 642 soldiers and of cargo.
The ADF Movements staff not only had to find commercial airlift and sealift for the deployment to East Timor in a matter of days rather than the months that it would usually require, it also had to contend with the difficulty of moving troops, equipment and stores over the vast distances of Australia. Moving the 10th Force Support Battalion was a particular problem. The initial concept was that it should move overland from Townsville to Darwin, and embark for East Timor from there. But staff with the appropriate licences were not experienced in long-haul operations, and there was a high risk of loss of equipment in transit or in Darwin while awaiting shipment.
The movements officer in Sydney found two vessels whose owners were willing to charter on short notice, the "Calatagan", a grain ship, and the Danish "Svendborg Guardian", a container ship. Neither was particularly suitable, and the crews spoke little English, but with the help of a local stevedore company, the ships were modified by the installation of tie down restraints. Some of vehicles and equipment were moved directly from Townsville to Dili without loss. Another of vehicles and equipment had to be moved by road to Darwin, from whence it was shipped to Dili in vessels that included the , Singaporean , and the Danish civilian ship "Arktis Atlantic".
During Operation Stabilise, the ADF chartered seventeen commercial vessels to supplement its strategic lift capability. All were foreign, as the Department of Defence did not feel that Australian vessels offered the best value for money. The operation put the port of Darwin under great strain, and the facilities were upgraded, lifting the wharf capacity to . To reduce the strain on Darwin's facilities, casualties were evacuated to other cities, and where practical purchasing was conducted in Sydney to avoid overburdening local suppliers. The Darwin Port Authority, which managed the port with the assistance of a lone ADF liaison officer, were able to increase the port's turnover fourfold, and no shipping delays occurred.
Operations.
Distribution.
To effect Cosgrove's operational concept of flooding East Timor with as many combat troops as possible, Mark Evans deployed his brigade with a minimum of vehicles and logistical support. Unlike exercises conducted in northern Australia in the 1980s and 1990s, the logistical support would follow the combat troops, and not be pre-positioned to receive them. Since the operational situation was uncertain, demand for items like ammunition and medical supplies could not be forecast. The plan therefore was to build up stockpiles in Darwin from DNSDC in Sydney, and then forward them on demand to 10 FSB by air to Comoro airport via the ICAW or by sea to the port of Dili by HMAS "Jervis Bay" and "Tobruk". 10 FSB would then distribute them to 3 BASB or directly to the troops. To send supplies directly to Dili would have resulted in their arrival without troops to receive them, facilities to store them, or transport to distribute them, as had occurred to Australian forces in the Vietnam War in 1966. Cousins set priorities on the advice of Colonel Ash Power, Cosgrove's operations officer. Contingency stocks were held offshore on HMAS "Success".
ADF cargo was tracked using three computer systems, the Standard Defence Supply System (SDSS), Lotus Notes Interim Demand System (LNIDS), and the Cargo Visibility System (CVS). These had been employed by the ADF Peace Monitoring Group in Bougainville in 1994, and had been improved as a result of that experience. The problem of disjointed logistics systems had been recognised for years. CVS was not used in Operation Warden, as it could not handle large volumes of urgent requirements. SDSS was the Department of Defence's preferred system, but units in the field preferred the simpler LNIDS, even for inventory items, which it was not intended to handle.
McManus's FLSG had responsibility for the purchase, receipt, storage and forwarding of supplies from Darwin. He did not have sufficient operators trained in the use of SDSS and LNIDS to track their movements and order items such as spare parts, nor did he have sufficient personnel to prepare pallets or load aircraft, and there were only four trained staff who were available to deal with what soon became a flood of mail. He established an ad hoc unit called the Top End Distribution Squadron (TEDS), and leased some former military warehouses in the Darwin suburb of Berrimah from their new owners, where stocks could be held until called forward. A terminal operations unit was created at RAAF Base Darwin to handle air dispatch. He coordinated air delivery with No. 395 Expeditionary Combat Support Wing and No. 321 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron RAAF at RAAF Base Darwin, and sea delivery with the naval base. Eventually some 120 personnel were assigned to the FLSG, drawn from 9th and 10th Force Support Battalions and the 7th Combat Service Support Battalion. Kinloch was appointed commander, Land Component Support Group, and would be responsible for the support of the advance elements in Dili until the 10th Force Support Battalion arrived.
Sustainment.
The first priority was water. Until engineer units with boring equipment arrived, there was no potable water in Dili. Every soldier had to carry a day's supply, which meant on their backs. Another day's supply went with the troops on their aircraft and ships as packaged water. Two water tankers, each holding , arrived on 21 September on landing craft. These were used to refill jerry cans sent by sea and air. HMAS "Tobruk" carried three trucks loaded with bottled water and jerry cans. Contingency stocks were held offshore on HMAS "Success". Similarly, Cousins had each soldier carry a day's combat rations. He anticipated that everyone would be eating combat rations for at least two, and possibly three weeks. Additional rations were carried on HMAS "Tobruk" and "Jervis Bay", but the first substantial resupply did not occur until "Tobruk" returned on 26 September. A contingency stock of 10,000 combat rations was held on HMAS "Success". Non-Australian contingents had been instructed to bring 42 days' supplies with them, but most arrived requiring assistance with their immediate needs, including catering, transport and unloading their equipment and supplies. The first contingent of Filipino troops arrived without rations or water.
Fuel presented a problem because the ADF had no ship-to-shore refuelling capability. Naval units were the sole source of the diesel and aviation fuel for units in East Timor for the first three months of Operation Stabilise, during which INTERFET consumed of fuel per day. Initially, packaged fuel was flown from HMAS "Success" to the heliport by RAN Westland Sea King helicopters in collapsible fuel drums as underslung loads. Once Army tanker trucks arrived in mid-October, they were driven onto landing craft from the hard stand east of the wharf, taken out to HMAS "Success", and then refuelled while alongside. This process took about five hours. Drivers of the fuel and water tankers were invited to come aboard HMAS "Success", where they could take a shower, enjoy a hot meal, and have their clothes laundered while they waited for the tanker to be refilled. HMNZS "Endeavour" ran a shuttle service to East Timor from Singapore or Darwin, typically replenishing HMAS "Success" with of aviation fuel and of diesel fuel on each run. "Endeavour" returned home on 20 October, followed by "Success", which was relieved by , which arrived with a Sea King from 443 Maritime Helicopter Squadron.
Each soldier carried an initial supply of ammunition. More stocks arrived on HMAS "Tobruk" and "Jervis Bay", and contingency reserves were held on ships in Dili harbour. Due to its weight, ammunition resupply was by sea rather than by air. For other items such as spare parts and medical supplies, each unit was directed to bring 15 to 30 days' supply. While the 1,500 soldiers of the 3rd Brigade had limited stocks of ammunition on hand, there were some 15,000 TNI troops in the area, who presumably had plenty of ammunition. Nor were the air and sea bridges secure from interception: the TNI had naval assets in the area that included surface combatants and two Type 209 submarines, and intelligence sources reported that TNI aircraft based in West Timor included three BAE Systems Hawks, North American Rockwell OV-10 Broncos, an Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma and a CASA C-212 Aviocar. RAAF Lockheed P-3 Orions kept a lookout for the submarines, and two McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornets were kept on standby in case air defence or close air support missions were required.
The supply plan was simple, but finely tuned, with little room for error. It fell apart in the first 48 hours. Medical personnel and supplies were unexpectedly delayed. This was critical, as it was not known whether there would be casualties. There were unforeseen requirements like RAAF personnel and equipment to run the airport, and, unlike Operation Spitfire, the ADF was not ICAW's only customer. There was political pressure to deploy media representatives and UNAMET personnel with their equipment and stores, and the remaining elements of 2 RAR and 3 BASB with their vehicles and stores, and bottled water, were pushed back in the queue. Members of the 3rd Brigade who wanted to join their comrades in East Timor were frustrated at seeing others boarding flights instead of themselves, and subjected the movements staff to abuse. An abandoned fleet of Land Rover Discovery vehicles was made available to INTERFET at the UNAMET compound, which partially offset 2 RAR's vehicle shortage. The emergency stocks of water on HMAS "Success" had to be brought ashore immediately, and 2 RAR commandeered water that had been flown in as part of 3 BASB's stocks. When 3 RAR arrived on "Jervis Bay" with 500 cartons of bottled water, they handed over part of this stockpile to 2 RAR.
Dili, Baucau and Lospalos were secured by 4 October, and the INTERFET forces began moving into the areas adjoining the border with West Timor. The first phase of this was Operation Lavarack, in which 2 RAR moved by air and B Squadron, 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment, with its armoured personnel carriers, by sea, to occupy Balibo, which was secured on 5 October. Maliana, in the middle of the border between East and West Timor was next, on 10 October. Operation Strand, the landings at Suai on the south coast, commenced on 6 October. Then, on 22 October, Operation Respite began, and secured the isolated Oecussi enclave. Finally, on 21 November, the Gurkhas landed on Atauro island, north of Dili.
It was imperative to get 10 FSB to Dili before unit-level supplies and the reserves held by the Land Component Support Group had been consumed. A seven-man reconnaissance party led by Kehoe flew from Townsville to Darwin via Brisbane on a Qantas flight on 26 September, and thence to Dili on a French C-130H the next day. Kehoe decided to establish 10 FSB at the port, despite the risk involved in storing ammunition there. He flew back to Darwin to meet the Advance Party, who flew direct to Darwin from Garbutt Airport on an Air Niugini aircraft on 30 September, and then travelled to Dili overnight on HMAS "Jervis Bay". The main body followed by the same route on 8 October.
Colonel Grant Cavanaugh was appointed the commander of the Logistic Support HQ. He had arrived in Dili on 24 September, but had no staff, and no authority over Kinloch, who was answerable to Mark Evans, or McManus, who was answerable to Cosgrove. To fill out Cavanaugh's HQ, Wilkinson stripped his own. Wilkinson was assisted by students from the Australian Command and Staff College, who helped draw up a 40-page force-level logistic operation order with 54 annexes. The deployment of 10 FSB was delayed due to a decision to give priority to unloading the vehicles and stores of the 5th/7th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (5/7 RAR), and 10 FSB did not become operational until 20 October. By 14 October, the APCs of B Squadron, 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment, were barely serviceable. The vehicles' track pads had been worn down through three weeks of high tempo operations, and there were no spare parts to conduct necessary maintenance or repairs. Some vehicles were deadlined, while restrictions were imposed on the use of others until the remainder of B Squadron arrived a week later with spare parts. The Mack trucks were no longer in production, and spare parts had to be custom made.
Movements staff gave priority to food, water, fuel and ammunition. Foreign contingents complained about confusion over priority and authority. The Canadian contingent reported that in Darwin:
Construction.
The first sappers to arrive in East Timor were the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment, the main body of which had arrived on HMAS "Jervis Bay" on 27 September. It was operating in support of the 3rd Brigade. The 198th Works Section deployed on 2 and 5 October. This was a unit that planned, coordinated and managed construction tasks. Between 10 and 13 October, Colonel Ahmad Mostafa conducted a detailed engineering reconnaissance of East Timor, and developed an engineering plan. He identified three major engineering challenges. The first was roads. The 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment devoted much of its time to maintaining roads and bridges, but the imminent rainy season threatened to make them impassable. It also would potentially reduce INTERFET's vehicle and accommodation areas and the airport to quagmires. The provision of hard stands to prevent this was the second challenge. The third was waste disposal. Human waste was being disposed of with hundreds of portaloos that had been brought from Australia, and were routinely emptied by sewage collection trucks. Dry waste was disposed of in a rubbish tip that had been established at Comoro.
At an early stage it was appreciated that what little infrastructure there was in East Timor was being destroyed by the pro-Indonesia militia, but there was no engineering staff at DJFHQ. The ADF's engineering capability had been reduced by defence cuts, but the Army still maintained two construction squadrons, largely thanks to its involvement in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's Army Community Assistance Program (AACAP), which provided facilities for indigenous communities in remote areas. In August 1999, the 17th Construction Squadron was in Sydney on 180 days' notice to move, having just completed an AACAP tour in Jumbun, Queensland, while the 21st Construction Squadron was in Rockhampton, supporting Crocodile 99. The 17th Construction Squadron was placed on 28 days' notice to move on 13 September, but was not given more personnel to bring it up to full strength, nor authorisation to requisition or purchase engineering stocks and equipment. On 20 September it was given seven days' notice to move. Only then was it topped up with 22 sappers from other units. It was hoped that engineering requirements would be met by other nations, but this did not occur. Appeals to contribute engineering units produced a construction troop from Kenya, which was due to arrive in late December.
The advance party of the 17th Construction Squadron assumed responsibility for the main water point in Dili from the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment on 14 October, and began looking for other water sources. The main body arrived in East Timor with its 160 personnel and 130 vehicles on 26 October. Abandoned bores were restored, and filters and chlorinators installed, giving both INTERFET personnel and the civilian population access to a regular supply of clean drinking water. Major General Desmond Mueller's Support Command supplemented the 17th Construction Squadron's equipment with a newly purchased rock crusher, track-mounted concrete batch plant, and a cherry picker. Its task was complicated by unfilled requisitions, which the overburdened supply system could not meet.
The 17th Construction Squadron's next priority was upgrading the Dili heliport to facilitate all-weather operations. The heliport was located on low ground that was susceptible to flooding in the wet season. The 198th Works Section produced a design that called for the excavation of the subbase, the construction of hard stands, and laying pierced aluminium plank for eleven helipads. The work was carried out by the 17th Construction Squadron, and took four weeks to complete. At Suai, the airstrip was upgraded to support all-weather C-130 operations. The runway was extended by , and a turning node added. Hard stands were provided, along with accommodation, workshops and five helipads.
Mostafa was determined to have 21st Construction Squadron sent to East Timor as well, but senior Department of Defence officials were concerned that the INTERFET was going beyond its mandate, and developing East Timor's infrastructure – the reason for not deploying engineer construction assets in the first place. Finally, on 8 November, the 21st Construction Squadron was ordered to send a plant troop group to East Timor to assist in road maintenance, its numbers capped at 80 personnel. The main body arrived in Dili on 3 December, but the ship carrying its heavy plant and equipment did not reach Brisbane until 27 November, and broke down several times en route. Work on the roads finally commenced on 17 December. The 21st Construction Squadron repaired the main route from Dili to Aileu. The Kenyan troop arrived on 26 December and worked on repairing the roads to the south. After an initial downpour, the rainy season was not as severe as feared, but the departure of the 3rd Combat Engineer Regiment in mid-January left no resources to maintain the roads in the border areas.
To resolve the waste disposal problem, the 17th Construction Squadron erected ATCO ablution buildings, with pump-out septic tanks and an independent water supply. Laundry buildings were assembled with associated plumbing and electrical fittings, and separate treatment facilities for black and grey water. A solid waste disposal site was developed about from Dili. A semi-permanent camp for up to 500 personnel with ATCO-style accommodation was established at Dili airport. Horizontal works were carried out by the 17th Construction Squadron, while the No. 381 Expeditionary Combat Support Squadron erected the buildings. Finally, the 17th Construction Squadron built a facility for cleaning stores, equipment and vehicles being returned to Australia to comply with Australia's strict quarantine regulations. This facility had 20 bays with water tanks and pumps, and associated electrical, plumbing and water reticulation.
Amenities.
By late October 1999, expectations that units in East Timor could live more comfortably began to build. In Sydney, Lieutenant Colonel Dianne Gallasch negotiated contracts for deliveries of fresh produce to be shipped from Darwin, and established a flexible resupply system for rations. Refrigerated containers, generators and kitchen trailers were shipped to East Timor, allowing hot meals to be provided by 22 field kitchens six weeks after the first troops arrived in Dili. Yet many soldiers were still sleeping on the ground. There were still no laundry facilities, so soldiers washed their clothes in old ration tins. Funds were provided to hire East Timorese civilians to provide laundry facilities, but some units were more successful than others in using them wisely.
Cousins pressed for tents and camping stores to be sent, which Support Command in Melbourne struggled to provide among competing priorities. Cosgrove assigned top priority to maintaining the tempo of operations, and second to building up stocks of food, fuel, water and ammunition in time for the rainy season. As a veteran of the Vietnam War, where the Army had lived rough for longer periods, he believed that the troops could go without amenities for a bit longer. The Land Commander Australia, Major General John Hartley, visited East Timor on 4 and 5 November, and produced a report that was highly critical of the performance of Treloar and Mueller.
Throughout November, logistical personnel in Australia and East Timor worked to reduce the backlogs, build up stockpiles for the rainy season, and improve the living conditions of the troops in the field. FLSG forwarded an average of of cargo per day, and 60 refrigerated containers of fresh produce each week. The backlog of spare parts was overcome in early November, and canteens and showers were available in Balibo. On 12 November, 2 RAR finally received a full complement of camp stores, including tents, chairs, tables, stretchers and duckboards. On 15 December, Support HQ assumed responsibility for the support of the forces in East Timor.
Helicopters.
Unloading was difficult in the primitive conditions of the damaged ports in East Timor, especially at Suai, where there was no equipment to unload the containers that the Canadians and New Zealanders had brought their stores in. The containers had to be unloaded from HMAS "Tobruk" with one of its cranes onto a heavy landing craft, to be picked up by a side-loading truck when it reached the shore. This was neither quick nor safe. A better solution would have been to unload with heavy lift helicopters, but the RAN had none, and the Australian Army's CH-47 Chinooks were grounded due to problems with the transmissions. Australia Theatre HQ asked the United States Pacific Command (PACOM) for assistance. On 29 September, the United States Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, provided four CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters from the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, which operated from the Landing Helicopter Assault (LHA) ship . They were replaced on 5 October by helicopters of the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which flew from the LHA . The LHAs provided excellent maintenance support for the helicopters, and represented the United States while not adding to the US footprint ashore, but deploying thousands of sailors and marines just to support four helicopters was uneconomical.
PACOM turned to the US Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP). Two Mi-8 and two Mi-26 helicopters with air and maintenance crews were provided under contract by DynCorp. Operating helicopters ashore in the upcoming monsoon season required the construction of concrete helipads at Dili airport, but East Timor lacked the facilities to produce the concrete. All the construction equipment required, along with trained operators, had to be brought in. Providing food for the 100 personnel of the air, ground and construction crews, and fuel for their vehicles and helicopters, became an Australian responsibility under the bilateral Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) with the United States. Australian Theatre also helped with the movement of the personnel and equipment through the PACOM staging post in Darwin. The two Mi-8s, along with their spare parts and a fuel tanker, were flown from Bulgaria to East Timor in Russian AN-124 transport aircraft. The two Mi-26s flew from Russia under their own power, a trip that took ten days. Between December 1999 and February 2000, the four helicopters flew 475 hours without mishap, carrying 6,400 passengers and of cargo.
Medical.
The vaccination regime for Japanese encephalitis proved effective, and there were no recorded INTERFET cases. The main diseases affecting the troops were dengue fever and malaria, with 306 and 334 cases respectively. Both were endemic in East Timor. Australian troops recorded 224 cases of dengue fever In East Timor. There was no dengue vaccine, although there was some evidence that the Japanese encephalitis vaccine was partially effective against dengue. Nor was there any treatment other than rest until the patient recovered. Preventative measures for mosquito-borne diseases like dengue and malaria included the use of insect repellents, permethrin-treated mosquito nets, and mosquito control measures such as spraying suspected breeding areas with insecticides. A particular concern with dengue was that troops returning from East Timor to bases in Northern Queensland might cause an outbreak in Australia, as the area was receptive to dengue due to the presence of its principal vector, the "Aedes aegypti" mosquito. Nine confirmed cases were reported among soldiers in Townsville, who were closely monitored, but none among the civilian population.
As in previous wars, malaria was a major concern, and one Malaysian UN observer died from malaria. A prophylactic regime was instituted whereby ADF personnel were given a daily dose of of doxycycline commencing two days before departure from Australia and continuing for two weeks after returning to Australia. For those who suffered adverse side effects, a weekly dose of of mefloquine was substituted. A terminal prophylaxis of of primaquine three times a day was administered for three weeks after return from Australia. In addition, a small team from the Australian Army Malaria Institute headed by Major Scott J. Kitchener went to Dili as advisors. Subsequent trials of mefloquine in East Timor in 2001 and 2002 found that about 6.5 per cent of soldiers suffered side effects from it, mainly of a neuropsychiatric nature. There are ongoing concerns about the use of the drug.
The results showed that the memory of previous campaigns had faded since the Vietnam War ended in 1975 at every level of command. Officers failed to supervise the chemoprophylaxis regimen, and while most soldiers dutifully took their tablets, some did not. Both "Plasmodium falciparum" and "Plasmodium vivax" are endemic in East Timor, and the prevalence of malaria among the civilian population was much greater than usual in September 2000, due to many people fleeing from the violence into the jungle where there was greater exposure to mosquitoes. There were 64 cases of malaria among ADF personnel in East Timor. Since there was no evidence of resistance against doxycycline, the cause was either failure to take the tablets or their deterioration under tropical conditions. About two-thirds of cases were "falciparum", the remainder being "vivax". The "falciparum" cases were treated with a combination of quinine, mefloquine and doxycycline, while the "vivax" cases were treated with a combination of chloroquine and primaquine.
Another 212 cases were reported from ADF personnel after they returned to Australia. All were "falciparum" cases except for two who developed "vivax" within two weeks of return. Primaquine resistance has been documented in Papua New Guinea but not in East Timor, but the terminal regimen was not as effective as hoped. In any case, it was the only drug capable of eliminating the malaria parasites from the liver, so cases were administered another course of chloroquine and primaquine. It was noted that compliance with the treatment was excellent among those who had already suffered an attack of malaria. Some 44 cases had a relapse, eleven had a second relapse, and two had a third.
INTERFET's medical resources were stretched by the East Timorese civilian population, many of them children, who had broken bones or infected wounds from edged weapons. Some had fractures that had been improperly set. The available medical supplies were insufficient to cope with the demand, and the soldiers scrounged for medical supplies from abandoned clinics, the Dili General Hospital, and TNI stores. In mid-October, the INTERFET Field Surgical Team (FST) opened the INTERFET Hospital in the Museum building with 55 beds and a range of medical and surgical services. Personnel for the unit were drawn from the Army's 1st Field Hospital in Brisbane, and the 6th RAAF Hospital in Laverton, Victoria. The personnel had experience from Operation Shaddock, the deployment to Papua New Guinea to assist victims of the 1998 tsunami. While 80 per cent of admissions were of INTERFET personnel, the hospital also treated East Timorese and other civilians. The INTERFET Hospital maintained the only fully equipped intensive care unit in Dili. Less urgent cases were referred to the French Military Hospital and the Dili General Hospital, which was run by the Red Cross.
Civil affairs.
Over 72,000 civilians had returned to Dili by early October, mainly from the surrounding area, but increasingly from further afield. The Dili stadium became the focal point for the delivery of humanitarian aid. Techniques honed in Operation Solace, the Australian intervention in Somalia in 1992–1993, were employed to avoid disturbances at food distribution points. Lieutenant Colonel Joe Ison, USA, an experienced civil affairs officer from B Company, 96th Civil Affairs Battalion, which was normally based at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, established a Civil Military Operations Centre (CMOC) in Dili on 25 September. His ten-person team was augmented with Australians from INTERFET HQ. He coordinated relief efforts with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNICEF, World Food Programme, Red Cross, Oxfam and other agencies. In early November his team were replaced by a detachment from the 322nd Civil Affairs Brigade from Hawaii. When the 3rd Brigade moved to the border areas adjoining West Timor, agencies struggled to supply aid to the people there. One relief organisation representative told a CMOC meeting that it would take two months for his only truck to move of supplies to Suai on East Timor's south coast, assuming that monsoonal rains did not wash the roads away. Two CH-53s moved his supplies in one afternoon.
Postal.
Some members of the 10th Force Support Battalion had prior active service in Rwanda and Bougainville, but the volume of mail received in East Timor came as a surprise. Delivered to Australian Field Post Office (AFPO) 5 in Dili by forklift on large metal RAAF L pallets, the volume of mail increased from a day on October to per day in early November. As Christmas approached, families and friends of ADF personnel took advantage of the Australian government's offer of free mail delivery, and from mid-November the volume of mail increased to per day. "Jervis Bay" was employed to fetch the incoming mail from Darwin three times a week. Outgoing mail was dispatched to Australia seven days a week. As a result, the postal unit found themselves working from 14 to 16 hours a day.
Coalition logistics.
At its peak, INTERFET had 11,693 personnel from 23 countries. Of these 5,697 were from Australia, making it the largest deployment of Australian forces overseas since the Vietnam War. But, as Major Bronwyn Worswick, the legal officer at FLSG, noted, "our logistics system is set up to supply us. It's not set up to supply and sell basically to other countries". When operations commenced, formal arrangements regarding logistical support were in place only with the United Kingdom and New Zealand. Contingents therefore arrived without a clear idea of what they would be called upon to pay for, creating the potential for fractures in the coalition over supplies and their cost recovery.
While there was a requirement for INTERFET to account for all stores issued for later cost recovery, FLSG adopted a policy that rigid accounting was not required from New Zealand, as they were such close allies. The two nations shared a similar operational culture, in that immediate operational needs were considered paramount, and worrying about the details could be left for later. This culture was not shared by ASEAN nations, who wanted their logistical support provided on a commercial basis. Some contingents attempted to run a cash-based economy, paying for minor items at the point of acquisition. The South Korean force went so far as to seek financial compensation for the late delivery of rations. Australian fuel pumps did not have meters on them, so it was difficult to measure how much fuel was provided to contingents. Nor were there procedures in place for capturing the labour and materials required in servicing vehicles; these had to be developed in-theatre.
In the "Guidelines for Force Contributing Nations", contingents were asked to arrive in Australia self-sufficient for forty-two days. This proved to be little more than a vain hope. Some contingents, taking advantage of the speed at which the Australians had assembled the coalition, arrived with little or no logistical support, which they expected Australia to provide in its role as the lead nation. Crucial financial assistance came from Japan, which donated over USD$100 million. Due to the limitations of the Australian computer systems, it was not until September 2000 that the ADF's costs in supporting INTERFET could be tallied, which hampered Australian claims for reimbursement from the UN INTERFET Trust Fund.
End of mission.
Indonesia recognised East Timor as an independent nation on 19 October 1999, and TNI forces withdrew on 31 October, leaving INTERFET in charge. Between 1 and 23 February 2000 it transferred responsibility for the administration of East Timor to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). On 20 February 2000, the 10th Force Support Battalion handed over responsibility for support of the forces in East Timor, along with its few remaining personnel there, to the 9th Force Support Battalion. Australian logistical support was still required until UNTAET could stand on its own feet, and logistical handover to UNTAET was not completed until 1 July 2000.
Retrospect.
For Australia, the East Timor intervention revealed serious deficiencies in its logistical capabilities. There was no joint logistics doctrine, and the Army, RAN and RAAF had not practised joint logistical operations in support of joint task forces. Important equipment such as ship-to-shore refuelling capability was lacking, and there were insufficient forklifts and trailers to move shipping containers. There were skills shortages in critical areas such as air and water terminal operations, petroleum distribution, supply clerks, medical specialists and cooks. The notion that the ADF could shop for supplies like any other consumer was disproved, warehouses being unable to cope with sudden demands for personal items, stores, equipment and spare parts. US military aircraft had to fly in helmets and flak jackets from US sources. The logistical computer systems were designed to track cargo movements from one base to another in Australia, not to deployed forces. Personnel systems were not automated, and there were four cases of underage personnel being sent to East Timor. It took 54 days before Support Command was ready to assume responsibility for East Timor.
Wilkinson described the support of operations in East Timor as a logistics environment that was about "as easy as it gets". The theatre of operations was close to Australia; the area involved and the forces deployed were relatively small; there was no high-level combat; and logistical units could perform their duties unhampered by enemy action. The situation stabilised once INTERFET boots were on the ground, and the overburdened logistical system was not overwhelmed by urgent requests for high volumes of ammunition and other combat supplies. Whether by good luck or good management, Cosgrove had the resources he needed to carry out his mission without severe limitations resulting from inadequate logistics. While the troops had good reason to be critical of a lack of spare parts, medical supplies and amenities, "on balance," historian Bob Breen concluded, "Australians are harder on their logistical system than most nationalities and receive support that many other nationalities could only dream about."

In December 2017, the franchise requested the BCCI to shift its home from Mohali, Chandigarh, to some other city. The BCCI, however, rejected the plea after some members of the IPL Governing Council opposed the idea. According to "The Times of India", two BCCI officials pointed out that charging the franchise a few extra crores for shifting the base would not be a reasonable idea since the valuation for the home shift would be difficult to calculate.
On 13 March 2018, Kings XI Punjab unveiled their official jersey for the season while Kent RO Systems was announced as the chief sponsor of the team in a joint press conference.
On 16 March 2018, the Punjab Cricket Association requested the BCCI to reschedule some of Kings XI Punjab's home matches as Chandigarh Airport was likely to remain shut from 12 May to 31 May due to maintenance work. The team was supposed to play four home matches at the Punjab Cricket Association IS Bindra Stadium in Mohali from 4 May to 14 May, whereas the earlier home matches in April were scheduled to be held at Indore. On 20 March 2018, the franchise revealed their revised schedule, with Mohali hosting the first three home matches and Indore hosting the remaining four.

Quoile Bridge

The Quoile Bridge is a railway bridge across the River Quoile in Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland. It is long and carries a single-track line.
History.
Belfast &amp; County Down Railway.
The original bridge was constructed in 1859, one of the few river crossings on the Belfast and County Down Railway. It carried trains from Queen's Quay to Downpatrick and Newcastle. This bridge was made of timber piles with lattice trusses, and was replaced in 1929 with a steel girder bridge. After the railway was closed by the Ulster Transport Authority in 1950 (Having taken it over just two years prior), the bridge was abandoned and the girders and deck removed, through the concrete abutments and centre pier remained.
Downpatrick &amp; County Down Railway.
In 1999, Northern Ireland's only Irish standard gauge heritage railway, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway. began reconstructing the line from Downpatrick towards Belfast. This meant reconstructing the Quoile Bridge, which was done with £110,000 1929-replica girders fabricated in Dunmurry and brought to Downpatrick by lorry. The bridge opened to passenger traffic in 2004.
Today.
The Quoile Bridge is one of most notable features of the Downpatrick &amp; Co. Down Railway. It carries their 'North Line' from Downpatrick to Inch Abbey railway station and sees regular use, carrying over 10 trains per day on the weekends around St. Patrick's Day, May Day, Easter, the summer holidays and New Year's.

Ex Loggia Comunale

The building of the ex Loggia Comunale is located in Alcamo, in the province of Trapani.
History.
The citizens of Alcamo called ‘’loggia’’ the Town Hall; this custom was common in many Sicilian towns, and is also proved by several notary deeds.
Inside the Loggia, the town administrators held their meetings; the building is often mentioned in some documents dating back to 1525. It was rebuilt in 1548, according to the design of the architect Domenico Vitale, in the same place where the old one stood.
Thanks to the suppression of the religious order by the order of the king Ferdinand III of Sicily, in 1767 the "Giurati" moved into the Ex Jesuits’ College, so making use of more functional and large premises. As a result, the loggia was completely abandoned and, in 1783 it was put on sale in order to devote the proceeds for the works of the new seat.
In 1806, owing to the Jesuits’ return to Alcamo, the municipal authorities gave back the premises of the College and their seat was moved into Palazzo Palmerini located near the Mother church, the first year for rent and later by census, according to the deed dated 3 June 1807 by the notary Vincenzo Coppola. Nobody knows how long this palace was the municipality’s seat.
The floor built in 1558 had already fallen down in the second half of the 18th century and part of the decorations were used in the new construction which was started in 1813. In the 20th century the owners of the lodge became the Tobia family and their heirs; in 1976 a part of the building, sold to a building contractor, was rebuilt, but its interior remained unaltered.
Description.
The palace was distinguished for its portico with two arcades, one in the Corso and the other in via Barone San Giuseppe; in the eleventh chapter of his work entitled "Discorso storico della opulenta città di Alcamo situata a piè del Monte Bonifato, e dell'antichissima città di Longarico ossia Lacarico, dopo detta Alcamo, su di esso monte" Ignazio De Blasi, the famous historian from Alcamo wrote:
"la Loggia vecchia casa della città, destinata per i negozi pubblici dell'Università, e dove si convocava il pubblico consiglio per gli affari dello stato, di bellissima architettura, con vari archi e porte nel mezzo degli archi, sostenute da pilastri intagliati d'ordine dorico e ionico.
(That is: the Loggia which was the old Town Hall, intended for the public business of University, and where the Council held its meetings, of beautiful architecture, with several arches and doors in the middle of them, sustained by carved pillars of Doric and Ionian order.)"
The façade is quite rich and imposing, with a high pedestal in shiny travertine and lesenes ending with fluted corbels; the main door is located in Corso 6 Aprile: there is a round arch made with ashlars. In addition, in via Barone san Giuseppe there are four entrances on the ground floor and three balconies with stone galleries. In the Corso there is also a big balcony with wrought iron and three entries.

Zinaida Tusnolobova-Marchenko

Zinaida Mikhailovna Tusnolobova-Marchenko (; 23 November 1920 – 20 May 1980) was a Senior Medical NCO of the Red Army in the 849th Rifle Regiment during World War II. After being attacked by a German soldier in Kursk, suffering from severe frostbite, and getting gangrenous wounds she became a quadruple amputee. With her injuries forcing her to retire from the military she spoke on the radio and wrote an open letter to the soldiers of the 1st Baltic Front which received over 3,000 replies. She was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union on 6 December 1957 and the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1965, making her the third Soviet woman to receive the medal from the Red Cross.
Early life.
Tusnolobova-Marchenko was born on 23 November 1920 to a Russian family of farmers on the Shevtsovo farm in Polotsk, located in present-day Belarus. After graduating from secondary school she worked as a chemist in Leninskugol; she joined the military after the start of the war and became a member of the Communist party in 1942.
World War II.
Tusnolobova-Marchenko joined the Red Army in April 1942 after the start of the Second World War and after graduating from nursing courses was assigned to the 849th Rifle Regiment.
During her first eight months of military service, she evacuated 123 wounded Soviet soldiers from the battlefield. On 2 February 1943 while trying to rescue a wounded platoon commander she was seriously injured, with both of her legs broken. As German soldiers ran across the battlefield she pretended to be dead, but one soldier noticed she was alive and began viciously beating her, nearly to death. A night reconnaissance platoon noticed she was still alive and managed to get her to a field hospital three days later. Having suffered from severe frostbite doctors had to perform eight surgeries to save her life, amputating her left hand, entire right arm, left foot and right leg up to the knee. During the remainder of the war while she was recovering she wrote an open letter to the 1st Baltic Front asking them to take revenge for the suffering inflicted in her and others. In her letter she opened by stating she had been stuck in a hospital bed for 15 months because of the Axis, referring to the Axis only as "the fascists", briefly mentioned her life before the war but went straight to describing her anger at the Axis for how she had to write with a pencil tied to the stub of her elbow, how her brother lost his hand and her husband died in the war, putting it bluntly as "The fascists did it" before ending the letter asking them not to spare a single German soldier to take revenge for the Russian people. The letter resulted in over 3,000 letters and replies from the troops, promising revenge in her name. Numerous Soviet tanks and aircraft bore the text of saying things like "This is for Zinaida" and "For Zinaida Tusnolobova" (Russian: За Зину Туснолобову!), a practice so popular that another Hero of the Soviet Union, Pyotr Andreev, had it written on his plane.
Postwar life.
After the war she married a fellow veteran of the war, lieutenant Joseph Petrovich Marchenko who worked as an engineer after the war. One of her children, Vladimir Marchenko, served in the military for two years. In 1957, well after the end of the war, she was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union by decree of the Supreme Soviet for her courage in the war and was awarded the Florence Nightingale Medal in 1965 by the International Red Cross. She passed away from pneumonia in 1980 at the age of 59. Schools and streets in Belarus were named in her honor and a commemorative envelope bearing her portrait was issued by Belarus in 1992.

Oglaf

Oglaf is a pornographic comedy webcomic produced by Australians Trudy Cooper and Doug Bayne.
Authors and publication.
"Oglaf" is produced by Trudy Cooper and Doug Bayne,"" though this is not stated anywhere on the comic's website; reviewer Shaenon Garrity said in 2012 that the comic was "technically anonymous but instantly recognizable" as Cooper and Bayne. A 2013 Sequential Tart article said that "the site... doesn't tell who creates it", while a 2016 Paste Magazine article credited the comic to "Bodil Bodilson". The Patreon page for "Oglaf" states that the comic is made by "Trudy &amp; Doug" and the printed books are credited to them.
Cooper and Bayne had previously worked together on "Platinum Grit", and had also animated a music video together for Violent Soho. 
According to the website, the comic "started out as an attempt to make pornography [and] degenerated into sex comedy pretty much immediately." A new comic is released online each Sunday. The first two collections have been published in book form by TopatoCo, and a third book was crowdfunded on Kickstarter in July and August 2020.
Setting and style.
The comic takes place in a fantasy realm; a reviewer for ComicsAlliance described it as "a world created by shoving every existing fantasy world into a blender and setting it on puree." "Oglaf" has no overarching story, though does have many recurring characters and storylines. It features many explicit sex scenes; reviewers have called it "really REALLY pornographic" and "extremely, extraordinarily NSFW." The initial story is about a man named Ivan, who is apprenticed to a sadistic sorceress who forbids him to masturbate, or else his ejaculations come to life and report him. Comics have included shapeshifters, interspecies romance, fountains of youth, enchanted body parts, magical sex toys, and bedroom injuries with a literal ice queen. The archive notes which comics are less explicit.
Reception.
Inverse praised "Oglaf" for its depictions of gender and sexuality and The Escapist noted its inclusion of people of colour and LGBTQ+ characters. "Oglaf" won a Silver Ledger from 2016 Ledger Awards, which acknowledge excellence in Australian comic art and publishing. In 2013, it was called the Best X-Rated Strip by NJ.com. It was rated #1 in the Romance and Erotica category by ComicsAlliance for 2016. Oglaf.com was named one of the top porn sites for women by Cosmopolitan in 2017.
A reviewer for ComicsAlliance called "Oglaf" "some of the funniest smut on the web" and said, "imagine the funniest geek you know tried really hard to write magical porn, but they couldn't stop it from being laugh out loud funny. That's "Oglaf"...as dirty as it is, [it] somehow manages to be one of the lightest and most upbeat comics filled with sex that you're ever likely to find." A reviewer for io9 said, "It's the webcomic that unleashes the full, perverted potential of the high fantasy genre – the perfect comic for anyone who likes their dick jokes with a side of swords and sexually frustrating sorcery" and also said it deserved to be nominated for an Eisner Award. Paste Magazine included it in an article on "40 of the Best Webcomics" in 2016, saying "If only all porn was as funny as "Oglaf", the comic that made you laugh until you cried". Writing on Comic Book Resources, author Tim Seeley said that "Oglaf" "seems just as content making weird political jokes as it is making dick jokes. In addition to being smartly written, it's beautifully illustrated, and portrays a variety of sexualities and kinks, which ought to please any kind of pervert."

Abiy Ahmed

Abiy Ahmed Ali (; ; born 15 August 1976) is an Ethiopian politician who has been the 4th Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia since 2 April 2018. He was the third chairman of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) that ruled for 28 years and the first Oromo in that position. Abiy is an elected member of the Ethiopian parliament, and was a member of the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), one of the then four coalition parties of the EPRDF, until its rule ceased in 2019 and he formed his own party, the Prosperity Party.
He is the first Ethiopian and the first Oromo to be awarded a Nobel Prize, winning the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in ending the 20-year post-war territorial stalemate between Ethiopia and Eritrea. However, during this time, political and ethnic unrest, and ethnic discrimination increased in Ethiopia – marked by heightened episodes of violence, and armed conflict between government forces and TPLF forces. In June 2020, Abiy, in concert with the National Election Board of Ethiopia (NEBE), decided to postpone scheduled parliamentary elections due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This move prompted criticism, especially from the opposition, and raised questions about the delay's constitutional legitimacy.
In November 2020, simmering ethnic and political tensions, as well as attacks on the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF)'s Northern Command, exploded into the ongoing Tigray War between the combined forces of the ENDF and the Eritrean army against the Tigray People's Liberation Front, an ethnic party that dominated Ethiopian politics during a nearly thirty-year period marked by oppression and rampant corruption before Abiy came to power in 2018.
Personal life.
Early life.
Abiy Ahmed was born in the small town of Beshasha, located near Agaro, Jimma, Ethiopia. His deceased father, Ahmed Ali, was a Muslim Oromo while his deceased mother, Tezeta Wolde, was a Christian Oromo. Despite some sources claiming that his mother was an ethnic Amhara, Abiy said in an Oromia Broadcasting Network interview that both of his parents are Oromo and asserted that "no one is giving or taking away my "Oromummaa"." Abiy's father was a typical Oromian farmer, speaking only Oromo, while Tezeta was a fluent speaker of both Amharic and Oromo.
Abiy is the 13th child of his father and the sixth and youngest child of his mother, the fourth of his father's four wives. His childhood name was "Abiyot" (English: "Revolution"). The name was sometimes given to children in the aftermath of the Derg revolution of 1974. The then Abiyot went to the local primary school and later continued his studies at secondary schools in Agaro town. Abiy, according to several personal reports, was always very interested in his own education and later in his life also encouraged others to learn and to improve.
Abiy married Zinash Tayachew, an Amhara woman from Gondar, while both were serving in the Ethiopian Defense Forces. They are the parents of three daughters and one adopted son. Abiy speaks Afaan Oromo, Amharic, Tigrinya and English. He is a fitness aficionado and professes that physical health goes hand in hand with mental health and, as such, he frequents physical and gym activities in Addis Ababa. Abiy is a devout Evangelical Pentecostal Christian of the Full Gospel Believers' Church.
Religion.
Abiy is a Pentecostal, born of a Muslim father and an Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Christian mother. He was raised in a family of religious plurality. Abiy and his family are regular church attendees, and he also occasionally ministers in preaching and teaching the Gospel at the Ethiopian Full Gospel Believers' Church. His wife Zinash Tayachew is also a Pentecostal who ministers in her church as a gospel singer. Abiy frequently underscores the importance of faith and as a result, almost all faith communities are enjoying greater liberality in his tenure. The four main state television stations (ETV (Ethiopia), Walta TV, Addis TV and Fana TV) have been airing religious services almost every day since the COVID-19 pandemic.
Education.
While serving in the Ethiopian National Defense Force, Abiy received his first degree, a Bachelor's degree in computer engineering from the Microlink Information Technology College in Addis Ababa in 2009.
Abiy holds a Master of Arts in transformational leadership earned from the business school at Greenwich University, London, in collaboration with the International Leadership Institute, Addis Ababa, in 2011. He also holds a Master of Business Administration from the Leadstar College of Management and Leadership in Addis Ababa in partnership with Ashland University in 2013.
Abiy, who had started his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) work as a regular student, claims to have completed his PhD thesis in 2017 at the Institute for Peace and Security Studies, Addis Ababa University. He did his PhD work on the Agaro constituency with the PhD thesis entitled "Social Capital and its Role in Traditional Conflict Resolution in Ethiopia: The Case of Inter-Religious Conflict In Jimma Zone State" (Promoter: Professor Yelom). Abiy published a related short research article on de-escalation strategies in the Horn of Africa in a special journal issue dedicated to countering violent extremism.
Military career.
At the age of 14, in early 1991, he joined the armed struggle against the Marxist–Leninist regime of Mengistu Haile Mariam after the death of his oldest brother. He was a child soldier, affiliated to the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), which at that time was a tiny organization of only around 200 fighters in the large coalition army of about 100,000 fighters that resulted in the regime's fall later that year. As there were only so few ODP fighters in an army with its core of about 90,000 Tigrayans, Abiy quickly had to learn the Tigrinya language. As a speaker of Tigrinya in a security apparatus dominated by Tigrayans, he could move forward with his military career.
After the fall of the Derg, he took formal military training from Assefa Brigade in West Wollega and was stationed there. Later on in 1993 he became a soldier in the now Ethiopian National Defense Force and worked mostly in the intelligence and communications departments. In 1995, after the Rwandan genocide, he was deployed as a member of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR) in the country's capital, Kigali. In the Ethio-Eritrea War between 1998 and 2000, he led an intelligence team to discover positions of the Eritrean Defence Forces.
Later on, Abiy was posted back to his home town of Beshasha, where he – as an officer of the Defense Forces – had to address a critical situation of inter-religious clashes between Muslims and Christians with a number of deaths. He brought calm and peace in a situation of communal tensions accompanying the clashes. In later years, following his election as an MP, he continued these efforts to bring about reconciliation between the religions through the creation of the Religious Forum for Peace.
In 2006, Abiy was one of the co-founders of the Ethiopian Information Network Security Agency (INSA), where he worked in different positions. For two years, he was acting director of INSA due to the director's leave of absence. In this capacity, he was board member of several government agencies working on information and communications, like Ethio telecom and Ethiopian Television. He attained the rank of Lieutenant colonel before deciding in 2010 to leave the military and his post as deputy director of INSA (Information Network Security Agency) to become a politician.
Political career.
Member of Parliament.
Abiy started his political career as a member of the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP). The ODP has been the ruling party in Oromia Region since 1991 and also one of four coalition parties of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF). He became a member of the central committee of ODP and congress member of the Executive Committee of the EPRDF in quick succession.
In the 2010 national election, Abiy represented the woreda of Agaro and became an elected member of the House of Peoples' Representatives, the lower chamber of the Ethiopian Federal Parliamentary Assembly. Before and during his time of parliamentary service, there were several religious clashes among Muslims and Christians in Jimma Zone. Some of these confrontations turned violent and resulted in the loss of life and property. Abiy, as an elected member of parliament took a proactive role in working with several religious institutions and elders to bring about reconciliation in the zone. He helped set up a forum entitled "Religious Forum for Peace""," an outcome of the need to devise a sustainable resolution mechanism to restore peaceful Muslim-Christian community interaction in the region.
In 2014, during his time in parliament, Abiy became the director-general of a new and in 2011 founded Government Research Institute called Science and Technology Information Center (STIC). The following year, Abiy became an executive member of ODP. The same year he was elected to the House of Peoples' Representatives for a second term, this time for his home woreda of Gomma.
Rise to power.
Starting from 2015, Abiy became one of the central figures in the violent fight against illegal land grabbing activities in Oromia Region and especially around Addis Ababa. Although the Addis Ababa Master Plan at the heart of the land-grabbing plans was stopped in 2016, the disputes continued for some time resulting in injuries and deaths. It was this fight against land-grabbing, that finally boosted Abiy Ahmed's political career, brought him into the spotlight and allowed him to climb the political ladder.
In October 2015, Abiy became the Ethiopian Minister of Science and Technology (MoST), a post which he left after only 12 months. From October 2016 on, Abiy served as Deputy President of Oromia Region as part of the team of Oromia Region's president Lemma Megersa while staying a member of the Ethiopian Federal House of Peoples' Representatives. Abiy Ahmed also became the head of the Oromia Urban Development and Planning Office. In this role, Abiy was expected to be the major driving force behind Oromia Economic Revolution, Oromia Land and Investment reform, youth employment as well as resistance to widespread land grabbing in Oromia region. As one of his duties in office, he took care of the one million displaced Oromo people displaced from the Somali Region from the 2017 unrest.
As head of the ODP Secretariat from October 2017, Abiy facilitated the formation of a new alliance between the Oromo and Amhara groups, which together constitute two-thirds of the Ethiopian population.
In early 2018, many political observers considered Abiy and Lemma Megersa as the most popular politicians within the Oromo community, as well as other Ethiopian communities. This came after several years of unrest in Ethiopia. But despite this favourable rating for Abiy Ahmed and Lemma Megersa, young people from the Oromia region called for immediate action without delays to bring fundamental change and freedom to Oromia Region and Ethiopia – otherwise more unrest was to be expected. According to Abiy himself, people are asking for a different rhetoric, with an open and respectful discussion in the political space to allow political progress and to win people for democracy instead of pushing them.
Until early 2018, Abiy continued to serve as head of the ODP secretariat and of the Oromia Housing and Urban Development Office and as Deputy President of Oromia Region. He left all these posts after his election as the leader of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.
EPRDF leadership election.
Following three years of protest and unrest, on 15 February 2018 the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, announced his resignation – which included his resignation from the post of EPRDF chairman.
Historically, the incoming EPRDF chairman is the next Prime Minister. The EPRDF chairman on the other hand is one of the heads of the four parties that make up the ruling coalition: Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM) and Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).
Hailemariam's resignation triggered the first ever contested leadership election among EPRDF coalition members to replace him. A lot of political observers made Lemma Megersa (the ODP chairman) and Abiy Ahmed the front-runners to become the Leader of the ruling coalition and eventually Prime Minister of Ethiopia. Despite being the clear favorite for the general public, Lemma Megersa was not a member of the national parliament, a requirement to become Prime Minister as required by the Ethiopian constitution. Therefore, Lemma Megersa was excluded from the leadership race. On 22 February 2018, Lemma Megersa's party, ODP, called for an emergency executive committee meeting and replaced him as Chairman of ODP with Abiy Ahmed, who was a member of parliament. Some observers saw that as a strategic move by the ODP to retain its leadership role within the coalition and to promote Abiy Ahmed to become Prime Minister.
On 1 March 2018, the 180 EPRDF executive committee members started their meeting to elect the leader of the party. Each of the four parties sent in 45 members. The contest for the leadership was among Abiy Ahmed of ODP, Demeke Mekonnen, the Deputy Prime Minister and ADP leader, Shiferaw Shigute as Chairman of SEPDM and Debretsion Gebremichael as the Leader of TPLF. Despite being the overwhelming favorite by the majority of Ethiopians, Abiy Ahmed faced major opposition from TPLF and SEPDM members during the leadership discussions.
On 27 March 2018, a few hours before the beginning of the leadership elections, Demeke Mekonnen, who had been seen as the major opponent to Abiy Ahmed, dropped out of the race. Many observers saw this as an endorsement of Abiy Ahmed. Demeke was then approved as Deputy Prime Minister for another term. Following Demeke's exit, Abiy Ahmed received a presumably unanimous vote from both the ADP and ODP executive members, with 18 additional votes in a secret ballot coming from elsewhere. By midnight, Abiy Ahmed was declared Chairman of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the EPRDF, and was considered as the Prime Minister Designate of Ethiopia by receiving 108 votes while Shiferaw Shigute received 58 and Debretsion Gebremichael received 2 votes. On 2 April 2018, Abiy Ahmed was elected as Prime Minister of Ethiopia by the House of Representatives and sworn in.
Prime Minister of Ethiopia.
On 2 April 2018, Abiy was confirmed and sworn in by the Ethiopian parliament as Prime Minister of Ethiopia. During his acceptance speech, he promised political reform; to promote the unity of Ethiopia and unity among the peoples of Ethiopia; to reach out to the Eritrean government to resolve the ongoing Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict after the Eritrean–Ethiopian War and to also reach out to the political opposition inside and outside of Ethiopia. His acceptance speech sparked optimism and received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the Ethiopian public including the opposition groups inside and outside Ethiopia. Following his speech, his popularity and support across the country reached a historical high and some political observers argued that Abiy was overwhelmingly more popular than the ruling party coalition, the EPRDF.
Domestic policy.
Since taking office in April 2018, Abiy's government has presided over the release of thousands of political prisoners from Ethiopian jails and the rapid opening of the country's political landscape. In May 2018 alone the Oromo region pardoned over 7,600 prisoners. On 29 May Ginbot 7 leader Andargachew Tsege, facing the death penalty on terrorism charges, was released after being pardoned by President Mulatu Teshome, along with 575 other detainees.
That same day, charges were dropped against Andargachew's colleague Berhanu Nega and the Oromo dissident and public intellectual Jawar Mohammed, as well as their respectively affiliated US-based ESAT and OMN satellite television networks. Shortly thereafter, Abiy took the "unprecedented and previously unimaginable" step of meeting Andargachew, who twenty-four hours previously had been on death row, at his office; a move even critics of the ruling party termed "bold and remarkable". Abiy had previously met former Oromo Liberation Front leaders including founder Lencho Letta, who had committed to peaceful participation in the political process, upon their arrival at Bole International Airport.
On 30 May 2018, it was announced the ruling party would amend the country's "draconian" anti-terrorism law, widely perceived as a tool of political repression. On 1 June 2018, Abiy announced the government would seek to end the state of emergency two months in advance of the expiration its six-month tenure, citing an improved domestic situation. On 4 June 2018, Parliament approved the necessary legislation, ending the state of emergency. In his first briefing to the House of Peoples' Representatives in June 2018, Abiy countered criticism of his government's release of convicted "terrorists" which according to the opposition is just a name the EPRDF gives you if you are a part or even meet the "opposition". He argued that policies that sanctioned arbitrary detention and torture themselves constituted extra-constitutional acts of terror aimed at suppressing opposition. This followed the additional pardon of 304 prisoners (289 of which had been sentenced on terrorism-related charges) on 15 June.
The pace of reforms has revealed fissures within the ruling coalition, with hardliners in the military and the hitherto dominant TPLF said to be "seething" at the end of the state of emergency and the release of political prisoners. These hardliners, centered around TPLF chief Debretsion Gebremichael, had grown to deeply resent the leadership of Abiy's predecessor Hailemariam (at times supposedly bringing him to the brink of tears), and had hoped to place a more assertive figure in the prime minister's office willing to "act with an iron fist", rather than a reformist.
An editorial on the previously pro-government website Tigrai Online arguing for the maintenance of the state of emergency gave voice to this sentiment, saying that Abiy was "doing too much too fast". Another article critical of the release of political prisoners suggested that Ethiopia's criminal justice system had become a revolving door and that Abiy's administration had quite inexplicably been rushing to pardon and release thousands of prisoners, among them many deadly criminals and dangerous arsonists. On 13 June 2018, the TPLF executive committee denounced the decisions to hand over Badme and privatize SOEs as "fundamentally flawed", saying that the ruling coalition suffered from a fundamental leadership deficit.
Transparency.
In 2018, to expand the free press in Ethiopia, Abiy invited exiled media outlets to return. One of the media outlets invited to return was ESAT (which had called for the genocide of Ethiopian Tigrayans). However, since assuming office in April 2018, Abiy himself had, as of March 2019, only given one press conference, on 25 August 2018 and around five months after he assumed office, where he answered questions from journalists. he has not given another press conference where he has not refused to answer questions from journalists (rather than reading prepared statements).
According to the NGOs Human Rights Watch, Committee to Protect Journalists and Amnesty International, Abiy's government has since mid 2019 been arresting Ethiopian journalists and closing media outlets (except for ESAT-TV). From the international media outlets, his government has suspended the press license of Reuters's correspondent, and issued a warning letter to the correspondents of both BBC and Deutsche Welle for what the government described as "violation of the rules of media broadcasting".
Economic reforms.
In June 2018, the ruling coalition announced its intention to pursue the large-scale privatisation of state-owned enterprises and the liberalization of several key economic sectors long considered off-limits, marking a landmark shift in the country's state-oriented development model.
State monopolies in the telecommunications, aviation, electricity, and logistics sectors are to be ended and those industries opened up to private sector competition. Shares in the state-owned firms in those sectors, including Ethiopian Airlines, Africa's largest and most profitable, are to be offered for purchase to both domestic and foreign investors, although the government will continue to hold a majority share in these firms, thereby retaining control of the commanding heights of the economy. State-owned enterprises in sectors deemed less critical, including railway operators, sugar, industrial parks, hotels and various manufacturing firms, may be fully privatised.
Aside from representing an ideological shift with respect to views on the degree of government control over the economy, the move was seen as a pragmatic measure aimed at improving the country's dwindling foreign-exchange reserves, which by the end of the 2017 fiscal year were equal in value to less than two months worth of imports, as well as easing its growing sovereign debt load.
In June 2018, Abiy announced the government's intention to establish an Ethiopian stock exchange in tandem with the privatization of state-owned enterprises. As of 2015, Ethiopia was the largest country in the world, in terms of both population and gross domestic product, without a stock exchange.
Foreign policy.
In May 2018, Abiy visited Saudi Arabia, receiving guarantees for the release of Ethiopian prisoners including billionaire entrepreneur Mohammed Hussein Al Amoudi, who was detained following the 2017 Saudi Arabian purge.
In June 2018, he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in Cairo and, separately, brokered a meeting in Addis Ababa between the South Sudanese president Salva Kiir and rebel leader Riek Machar in an attempt to encourage peace talks.
Djibouti and port agreements.
Since taking power Abiy has pursued a policy of expanding landlocked Ethiopia's access to ports in the Horn of Africa region. Shortly before his assumption of office it was announced that the Ethiopian government would take a 19% stake in Berbera Port in the unrecognized Republic of Somaliland as part of a joint venture with DP World. In May 2018, Ethiopia signed an agreement with the government of Djibouti to take an equity stake in the Port of Djibouti, enabling Ethiopia to have a say in the port's development and the setting of port handling fees.
Two days later a similar agreement was signed with the Sudanese government granting Ethiopia an ownership stake in the Port Sudan. The Ethio-Djibouti agreement grants the Djiboutian government the option of taking stakes in state-owned Ethiopian firms in return, such as the Ethiopian Airlines and Ethio Telecom. This in turn was followed shortly thereafter by an announcement that Abiy and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had reached an agreement for the construction of an Ethiopian logistics facility at Lamu Port as part of the Lamu Port and Lamu-Southern Sudan-Ethiopia Transport Corridor (LAPSSET) project.
The potential normalization of Ethiopia-Eritrea relations likewise opens the possibility for Ethiopia to resume using the Ports of Massawa and Asseb, which, prior to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict, were its main ports, which would be of particular benefit to the northern region of Tigray. All these developments would reduce Ethiopian reliance on Djibouti's port which, since 1998, has handled almost all of Ethiopia's maritime traffic.
Eritrea.
Upon taking office, Abiy stated his willingness to negotiate an end to the Ethio-Eritrean conflict. In June 2018, it was announced that the government had agreed to hand over the disputed border town of Badme to Eritrea, thereby complying with the terms of the 2000 Algiers Agreement to bring an end to the state of tension between Eritrea and Ethiopia that had persisted despite the end of hostilities during the Ethiopia-Eritrea War. Ethiopia had until then rejected the international boundary commission's ruling awarding Badme to Eritrea, resulting in a frozen conflict (popularly termed a policy of "no war, but no peace") between the two states.
During the national celebration on 20 June 2018, the president of Eritrea, Isaias Afwerki, accepted the peace initiative put forward by Abiy and suggested that he would send a delegation to Addis Ababa. On 26 June 2018, Eritrean Foreign Minister Osman Saleh Mohammed visited Addis Ababa in the first Eritrean high-level delegation to Ethiopia in over two decades.
In Asmara, on 8 July 2018, Abiy became the first Ethiopian leader to meet with an Eritrean counterpart in over two decades, in the 2018 Eritrea–Ethiopia summit. The very next day, the two signed a "Joint Declaration of Peace and Friendship" declaring an end to tensions and agreeing, amongst other matters, to re-establish diplomatic relations; reopen direct telecommunication, road, and aviation links; and facilitate Ethiopian use of the ports of Massawa and Asseb. Abiy was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts in ending the war. "Today News Africa" reports that a significant part of the international community consider it undeserved and question whether his Nobel Peace Prize ought to be revoked.
In practice, the agreement has been described as "largely unimplemented". Critics say not much has changed between the two nations. Among the Eritrean diaspora, many voiced disapproval for the Nobel Peace Prize focusing on the agreement with Eritrea when so little had changed in practice. In July 2020, Eritrea's Ministry of Information said: "Two years after the signing of the Peace Agreement, Ethiopian troops continue to be present in our sovereign territories, Trade and economic ties of both countries have not resumed to the desired extent or scale."
Egypt.
The dispute between Egypt and Ethiopia over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam has become a national preoccupation in both countries. Ahmed has warned: "No force can stop Ethiopia from building a dam. If there is need to go to war, we could get millions readied."
After the murder of activist, singer and political icon Hachalu Hundessa ignited violence across Addis Ababa and other Ethiopian cities, Abiy hinted, without obvious suspects or clear motives for the killing, that Hundessa may have been murdered by Egyptian security agents acting on orders from Cairo to stir up trouble. An Egyptian diplomat responded by saying that Egypt "has nothing to do with current tensions in Ethiopia". Ian Bremmer wrote in a "Time" magazine article that Prime Minister Abiy "may just be looking for a scapegoat that can unite Ethiopians against a perceived common enemy".
Religious harmony.
Ethiopia is a country of various religious groups, primarily Christian and Muslim communities. Both inter-religious and intra-religious divisions and conflicts were a major concern, where both the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and the Ethiopian Islamic Council experienced religious and administrative divisions and conflicts. In 2018, he was given a special "peace and reconciliation" award by the Ethiopian Church for his work in reconciling rival factions within the church.
Security sector reform.
In June 2018, Abiy, speaking to senior commanders of the Ethiopian National Defense Force (ENDF) declared his intention to carry out reforms of the military to strengthen its effectiveness and professionalism, with the view of limiting its role in politics. This followed renewed calls both within Ethiopia and from international human rights groups, namely Amnesty International, to dissolve highly controversial regional militias such as the Liyyu force. This move is considered likely to face resistance from TPLF hardliners, who occupy much of the military high command.
Notably, he has also called for the eventual reconstitution of the Ethiopian Navy, dissolved in 1996 in the aftermath of Eritrea's secession after an extraterritorial sojourn in Djibouti, saying that "we should build our naval force capacity in the future." It was reported that this move would appeal to nationalists still smarting from the country's loss of its coastline 25 years prior. Ethiopia already has a maritime training institute on Lake Tana as well as a national shipping line.
On 7 June 2018, Abiy carried out a wide-ranging reshuffle of top security officials, replacing ENDF Chief of Staff Samora Yunis with Lieutenant General Se'are Mekonnen, National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) director Getachew Assefa with Lieutenant General Adem Mohammed, National Security Advisor and former army chief Abadula Gemeda, and Sebhat Nega, one of the founders of the TPLF and director-general of the Foreign Relations Strategic Research Institute Sebhat's retirements had been previously announced that May.
Grenade attack.
A large peaceful demonstration was organized in Addis Ababa at Meskel Square on 23 June 2018 to show support for the new prime minister. Just after Abiy had finished addressing the crowd a grenade was thrown and landed just 17 metres away from where he and other top officials were sitting. Two people were killed and over 165 were injured. Following the attack, 9 police officials were detained, including the deputy police commissioner, Girma Kassa, who was fired immediately. Questions were asked as to how a police car carrying attackers got so close to the prime minister and soon after the car was set alight destroying evidence. After the attack the prime minister addressed the nation on national TV unhurt by the blast and describing it as an "unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united". On the same day the prime minister made an unannounced visit to the Black Lion general hospital to meet victims of the attack.
Sexual violence in war.
In a speech to assembled Ethiopian ambassadors in January 2019, Abiy Ahmed made a prescient remark regarding the sexual violence in the Tigray War. Alluding to the role of soldiers during the battle of Adua in 1896 and later, during the Eritrean war, Abiy said: “This hasn't been researched, but it's obvious. From the battle of Adwa during the time of Menelik, to the later wars, many people from central Ethiopia – Oromos, Amharas – have been going to Tigray to fight. They were there for the war with Eritrea, and there's been a military presence in Tigray for the 30 years since. So, if you're wondering what the proportion of Oromo in Tigray is, leave it for DNA to find out. [Hilarity in the audience] It's probably wrong to say this, but: those who went to Adwa, to fight, didn't just go and come back. Each of them had about 10 kids.” [Loud laughter of the audience and applause].
Jan Nyssen and colleagues consider this as “an open acknowledgement, even an endorsement, of military tactics and strategy that holds, as its central pillar, the use of rape in war”.
Cabinet reshuffle.
In the parliamentary session held on 16 October 2018, Abiy proposed to reduce the number of ministries from 28 to 20 with half of the cabinet positions for female ministers, a first in the history of the country. The new cabinet restructure included the first female president, Sahle-Work Zewde; the first female minister of the Ministry of Defense, Aisha Mohammed Musa; the first female minister of the new Ministry of Peace, Muferiat Kamil responsible for the Ethiopian Federal Police and the intelligence agencies; the first female press secretary for the Office of the Prime Minister, Billene Seyoum Woldeyes.
Internet shutdowns.
According to NGOs like Human Rights Watch and NetBlocks, politically motivated Internet shutdowns have intensified in severity and duration under the leadership of Abiy Ahmed despite the country's rapid digitalization and reliance on cellular internet connectivity in recent years. In 2020, Internet shutdowns by the Ethiopian government have been described as "frequently deployed". Access Now said that shutdowns have become a "go-to tool for authorities to muzzle unrest and activism." His government will the cut internet as and when, "it's neither water nor air" have said Abiy.
Political party reform.
On 21 November 2019, upon approval of EPRDF ruling coalition, a new party, Prosperity Party, is formed via merging of three of the four parties that made up the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and other five affiliate parties. The parties include the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP), the Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement (SEPDM), the Amhara Democratic Party (ADP), the Harari National League (HNL), the Ethiopian Somali Peoples Democratic Party (ESPDP), the Afar National Democratic Party (ANDP), the Gambella Peoples Unity Party (GPUP), and the Benishangul Gumuz Peoples Democratic Party (BGPDP). The programs and bylaws of the newly merged party were first approved by the executive committee of EPRDF. Abiy believes that "Prosperity Party is committed to strengthening &amp; applying a true Federal system which recognizes the diversity and contributions of all Ethiopians".
Civil conflicts.
Several violence and crackdowns have been occurred since months after he appointed in office. It also concurrently brought radical change of liberation, including freeing political prisoners, freedom of media and acceptace of Permanent Court of Arbitration in relation to Ethiopian-Eritrean war.
Amhara Region coup d'état attempt.
On 22 June 2019, factions of the security forces of the region attempted a coup d'état against the regional government, during which the President of the Amhara Region, Ambachew Mekonnen, was assassinated. A bodyguard siding with the nationalist factions assassinated General Se'are Mekonnen – the Chief of the General Staff of the Ethiopian National Defense Force – as well as his aide, Major General Gizae Aberra. The Prime Minister's Office accused Brigadier General Asaminew Tsige, head of the Amhara region security forces, of leading the plot, and Tsige was shot dead by police near Bahir Dar on 24 June.
Metekel conflict.
Starting in June 2019, fighting in the Metekel Zone of the Benishangul-Gumuz Region in Ethiopia has reportedly involved militias from the Gumuz people. Gumuz are alleged to have formed militias such as Buadin and the Gumuz Liberation Front that have staged attacks. According to Amnesty International, the 22–23 December 2020 attacks were by Gumuz against Amhara, Oromo and Shinasha, who the Gumuz nationalists viewed as "settlers".
October 2019 Ethiopian clashes.
In October 2019, Ethiopian activist and media owner Jawar Mohammed claimed that members of the police had attempted to force his security detail to vacate the grounds of his home in Addis Ababa in order to detain him the night of 23 October, intimating that they had done so at the behest of Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The previous day, Abiy had given a speech in Parliament in which he had accused "media owners who don't have Ethiopian passports" of "playing it both ways", a thinly veiled reference to Jawar, adding that "if this is going to undermine the peace and existence of Ethiopia... we will take measures."
Hachalu Hundessa riots.
The murder of Oromo singer Hachalu Hundessa led serious unrest across Oromia Region, Addis Ababa and Jimma from 30 June to 2 July 2020. The riots lead to the deaths of at least 239 people according to initial police reports.
Tigray War.
In early November 2020, an armed conflict began after 4 November Northern Command Attacks by TPLF security forces, prompting the ENDF to engage in war. The ENDF is supported by Eritrean Defence Force, Amhara and Afar Region special force with other regional forces, while TPLF was aided by Tigray Special Force and Tigray Defense Force.
Hostilities between the central government and the TPLF escalated after the TPLF rejected the central government's decision to postponing August 2020 elections to mid-2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, accusing the government of violating the Ethiopian constitution.
The TPLF carried out its own regional elections, winning all contested seats in the region's parliament. In response, Abiy Ahmed redirected funding from the top level of the Tigray regional government to lower ranks in a bid to weaken the TPLF party.
The central matter of the civil conflict, as portrayed by Abiy and as reported by Seku Ture, a member of the TPLF party, is an attack on the Northern Command bases and headquarters in the Tigray region by security forces of the TPLF, the province's elected party; though such a claim is contested.
The Ethiopian government announced on 28 November 2020 that they had captured Mekelle, the capital of Tigray, completing their "rule of law operations". However, there are reports that guerrilla-style conflict with the TPLF continues.
About 2.3 million children are cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance, said the United Nations. The Ethiopian federal government has made strict control of access to the Tigray region (since the start of the conflict), and the UN said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government have not yet brought humanitarian access. These include, "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel and other essentials that are running low" said UNICEF.
On 18 December 2020, looting was reported by EEPA, including 500 dairy cows and hundreds of calves stolen by Amhara forces. On 23 November, a reporter of AFP news agency visited the western Tigray town of Humera, and observed that the administration of the conquered parts of Western Tigray was taken over by officials from Amhara Region. Refugees interviewed by Agence France Presse (AFP) stated that pro-TPLF forces used Hitsats as a base for several weeks in November 2020, killing several refugees who wanted to leave the camp to get food, and in one incident, killed nine young Eritrean men in revenge for having lost a battle against the EDF
In his premature victory speech delivered to the federal parliament on 30 November 2020, Abiy Ahmed pronounced:
"Related to civilian damage, maximum caution was taken. In just 3 weeks of fighting, in any district, in Humera, Adi Goshu, ... Axum, ..., Edaga Hamus, ... The defence forces never killed a single civilian in a single town. No soldier from any country could display better competence."
On 21 March 2020, during a parliamentary session in which Abiy Ahmed was questioned on sexual violence in the Tigray War, he replied: "The women in Tigray? These women have only been penetrated by men, whereas our soldiers were penetrated by a knife”. There is a fear that the people of Tigray – and in particular the women – cannot live with what has been said, what has been admitted, and above all, with a Prime Minister who has endorsed a culture of rape."
Hence, the public image of a Nobel Peace Prize winner is being rapidly re-assessed by international media as increasingly grisly reports of atrocities emerge. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken has been quoted as saying that had seen "very credible reports of human rights abuses and atrocities," and that "forces from Eritrea and Amhara must leave and be replaced by 'a force that will not abuse the human rights of the people of Tigray or commit acts of ethnic cleansing'."
Political positions.
Abiy has been described as a "liberal populist" by the academic and journalist Abiye Teklemariam and the influential Oromo activist Jawar Mohammed. Alemayehu Weldemariam, a U.S.-based Ethiopian lawyer and public intellectual, has called Abiy "an opportunistic populist jockeying for power on a democratizing platform." On the other hand, Tom Gardner argues in "Foreign Policy" that he's not a populist, but more of a liberal democrat. However, Gardner acknowledges that Abiy has "occasionally used language that can be read as euphemistic and conspiracy-minded", and might have "exploited the system's vulnerabilities, such as a pliable media and politicized judiciary, for his own ends."
Calls to revoke Nobel Peace Prize.
In June 2021, representatives from multiple countries called for the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Abiy to be re-considered because of the war crimes committed in Tigray. In an opinion piece, Simon Tisdall, one-time foreign editor of "The Guardian", wrote that Abiy "should hand back his Nobel Peace Prize over his actions in the breakaway region".
A person on a petition organization called Change.org launched a campaign to gather 35,000 signatures for revoking his Peace Prize; as of September 2021, nearly 30,000 have been obtained.
Nicknames.
Getachew Reda, a senior official of the elected government of Tigray Region, mocked Abiy Ahmed in a tweet on the day of the general elections, saying the Tigray Defense Forces had captured hundreds of ENDF soldiers as a gift for Abiy's coronation as the "Naked Emperor of Ethiopia".

Imperial Quarter of Metz

 The Imperial Quarter of Metz is a district of the city of Metz, in the région of Grand-Est, in eastern France, initially built between 1902 and 1914 by the government of the ruling German Wilhelmine Empire, during the period of annexation of Alsace-Lorraine. Originally named "Neue Stadt" (literally "new city"), it is today divided between the administrative district of New Ville and Metz-Centre.
It is principally represented by the "Imperial Triangle," delineated by the area in between the water tower of the main railway station, St. Therese's Church, and the Serpenoise Gate. But the district extends beyond this core to include other edifices of the same period, such as the Governor's Palace, situated on the Place Giraud, behind the Serpenoise Gate.
Aside from the more important Neustadt district of Strasbourg, the Imperial Quarter of Metz contains the most complete and best-preserved examples of urbanism under the German Second Reich. In Germany itself, the comparable districts of such cities often suffered the bombardment by Allied forces in the Second World War. The Imperial Quarter is remarkable for the multiplicity of architectural styles represented, despite the voluntary Germanization assumed by the city.
History.
Up until the beginning of the twentieth century, the district was generally referred to as the "Neue Stadt" ("New City"), an area where the German authorities had decided to build a new extension south of the historic center of Metz. The enlargement of the city used the land ceded by the military garrison thanks to the removal of the old medieval city walls by order of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1898, but most of the development only gathered steam starting in 1902. The moniker "New City" was reborn after the French regained control of Metz in 1918 in the name of the administrative district "Nouvelle Ville."
This urbanization project proceeded under the guise of the modernization of the city of Metz, but equally under a marked desire of Wilhelm's government to Germanize the city. Metz essentially had existed as a city characterized by a French building tradition since the Middle Ages, and despite its inclusion within the boundaries of the Holy Roman Empire, the use of High Gothic architecture was evident in monuments such as the cathedral, which was less Germanic in character than the Cathedral of Strasbourg. Wilhelm II hoped to give the Metz a much more Germanic identity, breaking with the policies instituted under the reign of his grandfather Wilhelm I, wherein stylistic continuity in architecture had generally been respected.
The urban guidelines of 1903 instituted a different status to the north side of the "ring" of open land that was opened up with the demolition of the old ramparts. It stipulated that this area should consist of houses encircles by gardens, having a maximum height of three floors, in order to soften the transition between the older buildings of the city center and the new, taller apartment houses that would populate the areas to the south. The villas on what is today known as the Avenue Foch in Metz exude this kind of neat and tidy character, reflecting the traditions of the period, and use a diverse, usually historicist, set of styles.
Urbanism and General Morphology.
 The Imperial Quarter of Metz is distinguished by broader streets in a ring of urban development loosely defined by its main artery, the Avenue Foch. It is bordered to the north by the old city and to the south by the train lines and yards that form a man-made barrier. In keeping with the general tenets of Haussmannian nineteenth-century urban development, the Imperial Quarter is split up with regularity by large spaces such as public squares and isolated edifices that are distinguished from their neighbors by their style or their verdant surroundings. Thus, despite the dominating presence of rows of apartment buildings, certain parts of the district, such as the Vacquinière, to the southwest, neighboring the city of Montigny-lès-Metz, are composed entirely of mansions. The army installations, which predate the urban development of this area, are equally concentrated to the northwest.
The general organization of the space hinges on two main plazas, the Place Raymond-Mondon (formerly the Place Impériale), and the Place du Général-de-Gaulle, which forms the large forecourt to the main railway station, accessed from the rue Gambetta. When it was known as the Place Impériale, the Place Raymond-Mondon symbolized otherwise the associated powers of the Kaiser (an equestrian statue of whom, located there, was overturned in 1918 by the French). These included financial power, symbolized by the Imperial Bank; the corporate powers of the Chamber of Commerce; military power through the view of the Prince-Frederick-Charles army barracks; and the religious power with a church, whose construction was canceled due to the First World War. This plaza also constituted the junction between the new city and the old districts, as indicated by the preservation of the medieval Tour Camoufle, part of the old city walls.
Architecture.
The district is home to a remarkable diversity of architecture. It served, in effect, as a stylistic laboratory for the German architects in the city during the Second Reich. Historicist styles characterize the majority of the buildings, but respond often to the desire of the Imperial state to Germanize the city, which meant that many buildings use architectural styles that recall the German Middle Ages. In turn, the parts of the district constructed during the interwar period (1919–1939) retain the trend of continuing modernization of the city, but in a way that recalls its French heritage.
The period of urbanization during the 1900s and 1910s often revives architectural terms such as Rhenish-Romanesque-revival for Metz's railway station and the main post office, or Flemish-Renaissance-revival for the Governor's Palace. Everywhere one notes a multiplicity of styles in the architecture of private buildings of the era, a development easily visible in the eclectic composition of structures on the Avenue Foch, mixing a kind of Neoclassical rigor with elements of Art Nouveau or traditional Alsacian residences. On the other hand, certain francophile architects maintained their symbolic opposition to the newly entrenched German regime through their preference for neoclassical, Haussmannian apartment buildings. Still others were inspired by currents such as the Vienna Secession, manifest in the so-called Crystal Palace, whose façade was only rediscovered in the 1960s.
The architectural decoration is equally distinctive for its variety of colors, dominated by the grey and pink of buildings constructed of sandstone and the yellow of those constructed out of the "pierre de Jaumont", a type of local limestone.
The interwar period, when Metz reverted to French rule, was marked by a "revanchist" architecture, wherein one finds the large-scale use of Haussmannian Neoclassicism and a Baroque revival. These styles harmonize well with the heavy Neoclassicism characteristic of French architecture during the Belle Époque of roughly 1890–1914. These remain, however, less ostentatious overall than the German constructions throughout the rest of the district, out of respect in planning strategies for historic structures, as codified in an ordinance of the city of Metz between 1911 and 1939. In the 1930s, modern architecture also brought the implantation of Art Deco, already in full bloom elsewhere around the world.
Recognition.
 Even though it is depicted in postcards of Metz from the early twentieth century, the Imperial Quarter was not well-appreciated by Messins of the interwar period. They instead favored the nationalism of the Lorraine native Maurice Barrès, who castigated the architecture of Metz's railway station (which had been designed by the Berlin architect Jürgen Kröger and built between 1905 and 1908): "One welcomes the dignified ambition of a cathedral, but this is only tortuous, an immense paté of meat."
However, starting in the 1980s the Imperial Quarter gained new favor with both local officials and residents. Several campaigns for the renovation and refurbishment of the architectural patrimony of the district began, such as the cleaning of building façades, most notably those of the train station, which had blackened over the years. By 2014, the remaining restorations to take place encompassed a much smaller scale, such as those to the façade of the former Hôtel du Globe, on the Place du Général de Gaulle, facing the train station.
The district was nominated by the city for inscription by UNESCO onto its list of World Heritage Sites in June 2007 due to several features of original urban planning and architectural character:
When its candidacy was rejected, a new dossier was prepared in 2009 by the office of the mayor of Metz. This new application dubbed the district "Metz Royal and Imperial," thereby putting the emphasis on the double urban identity of the city, playing on the opposition and complementary nature between the "royal" old city around the cathedral (developed under the French monarchy of the "ancien régime" before 1789), and the Imperial Quarter developed under the Wilhelmine Empire. It thus showed the transformation of urban space from an older, clustered, topographically-oriented and organically-developed medieval city to the newer, rationally-planned, transportation-oriented and distinctly zoned sectors of the enlarged urban area. One month and a half after its submission to the French Committee for Worldwide Patrimony, the body approved its inscription to the list of French World Heritage Sites of UNESCO, later ratified by the Ministry of Culture and Communication. In April 2014, the internet site for UNESCO added the candidacy of Metz to its page for France.
Landmarks and Important Buildings.
The Ring.
Constructed in the wake of the demolition of the old city walls in 1902, the urban Ring of Metz begins at the Boulevard Paixhans/Boulevard du Pontiffroy, to the north of the historic city center, and enters the Imperial Quarter via the Avenue Jean XXIII and the Place Mazelle. Its southern side is dominated by the rail yards approaching the main railway station. Nearby here are situated:
The avenue Foch, notable for its green space and central walking path, features several private mansions at its west entrance:
The avenue also includes some other impressive buildings:
The Place Raymond-Mondon, built when the Imperial Quarter was laid out in 1902, was formerly the Place Impériale. In its center was an equestrian statue of Friedrich III of Germany, which the citizens of Metz toppled and destroyed in 1918. Around it, one will find:
The Avenue Joffre shows much more sobriety with one side including German buildings that are relatively austere, facing a set of French Haussmannian structures on the other side, leading up to the spot where Wilhelm II wanted to erect his church. The part of the avenue adjacent to the demolished walls—those dating from the Renaissance to the north and those built by Marshal Sébastien Vauban during the reign of Louis XIV to the south—is today an access ramp for the autoroute A31. Formerly a tree-lined avenue, this highway is marked at the north by the presence of the Square Gallieni and the gardens of the Governor's Palace. There, overlooking the Place Raymond-Mondon, are:
And along the highway:
Educational facilities.
The expansion of Metz during the period of German rule also prompted the construction of various other educational institutions across the city. The Germanization of the architecture of schools is evident in the old Ecole de la Place de la Grève de Metz ("Sandplatzschule"), today the Ecole de Saint-Eucaire; the Ecole communale des filles de la rue de Chèvre ("Madchenschule in der Ziegenstrasse"); at the Ecole de la rue Paixhans ("Volksschule in der Paixhansstrasse"); and even in the Ecole normale d'Instituteurs ("Lehrerseminar"), a teacher's college. Two such institutions specifically within the Imperial Quarter were built during this period:
More recently, the campus complex Georges-de-la-Tour—comprising both a collège (middle school), and the lycée (high school), has enlarged the site at the Place de Maud'huy, formerly that of the Barbot military barracks.

Early life and education.
Yang Chihung was born on 25 October 1947, in Chungli, Taiwan. He developed an interest in art in early childhood, and found inspirations to pursue an artist career after reading "Lust for Life – The Life of Vincent van Gogh", translated by poet Yu Kuang-chung, in junior high school. Between 1965 and 1968, he attended then National Taiwan College of Art, developing a sound foundation in oil painting under the tutelage of famous Taiwanese artists of the Japanese Colonial period, such as Liao Chi-chun, Li Mei-shu and Yang San-lang. Meanwhile, he actively attended events organized by the modern art groups of Taiwan, namely the Fifth Moon Group and Ton Fan Group, only to find himself both intimidated and dissatisfied with the then relatively conservative art environment in Taiwan. In 1979, he emigrated to the United States of America with his wife, Jane, and their son, Daniel. In 1984–85 and again in 1985–86, he was twice awarded a year's residency at The Clocktower Studio in New York City by MoMA P.S.1.
Career.
In 2013, Yang, along with Xu Bing, Zhang Huan, and Li Chen, were the four artists featured in the Discovery Channel Asia documentary series, Chineseness, a multi-series production that focused on postwar Chinese contemporary artists.

Libro de' Disegni

The Libro de' Disegni (Italian for "Book of Drawings") was a collection of drawings gathered, sorted and grouped by Giorgio Vasari whilst writing his "Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects". By the time of his death in 1574 it is thought to have contained around 526 drawings, of which 162 are now in the Louvre and 83 in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm. There are also drawings from the "Libro" in the prints and drawings departments of the Uffizi, the British Museum, the Albertina, the National Gallery of Art and other institutions.
Origins and dispersal.
Some art historians believe they were gathered to illustrate Vasari's "Lives" directly, as a visual index of the artists' works, whilst others believe it was a separate document in its own right. In his preface to the "Lives", Vasari described his reasons for writing:
No text reveals why Vasari compiled his collection of drawings, but it was probably to illustrate the styles of the different artists he wrote about and to show how he had divided them "into three parts, or rather let us call them periods, between the rebirth of the arts and our own time - each of these is distinguished from the others by manifest differences". The earliest drawing in the collection was by Cimabue and the latest dated to Vasari's own time. In the 1550 and 1568 editions of the "Lives" Vasari insisted on drawings as documents which allowed the viewer to perceive the "maniera" of the great masters of painting and mentioned when he owned one or two drawings by a particular artist, such as at the end of his life of Filippo Lippi:
("Fra Filippo drew very well, as one can see in my own "Libro" of the most famous painters, in the preparatory drawings for the altarpiece at Santo Spirito and the frescoes in the Prato chapel.") and in his life of Sandro Botticelli ("Sandro's drawings were of a totally unique excellence; and, after his death, more and more artists have been keen to have some of his drawings; and I myself, in my collection, have a few which were done with great care and judgement").
Giorgio Vasari was one of the founders of the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno set up in Florence by Cosimo I of Tuscany in 1563. He and the other founders wished to use this academy to promote artists above the status of artisans. He was also a passionate collector of drawings and in his "Libro" he set them in his own paper frames and gathered drawings by one or more painters on a single sheet. In 1528 he received a collection of Lorenzo Ghiberti's drawings, as one of Ghiberti's descendants.
After Vasari's death, the sheets of the "Libro" were initially bought in 1574 by the Florentine collector Niccolò Gaddi (1537-1591). They were then sold by Gaddi's heirs before 18 May 1638, the date of death of Lorenzo Sabbatini, who had been put in charge of the "Libro". They were then dispersed among the Medici, Arundel, Quesnel, Crozat and Mariette collections during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Louvre.
The first drawings from the "Libro de' Disegni" to enter the French national collection were bought by Everhard Jabach, probably when the Arundel collections were sold in 1646 and 1654 after his and his widow's deaths. They then passed from Jabach into Louis XIV's drawings collection in 1671. Further sheets from the "Libro" were added when the French royal collection bought part of the collection of Mariette in 1755 and when Saint-Morys's collection was seized by the revolutionary government in 1793. These later additions may have originated in the sale of the Crozat collection, for which a catalogue survives. Part of the Mariette collection was sold to the royal collection in 1775. Other pages entered the French national collection from émigré goods seized by the revolutionary government and via gift and purchase.
Stockholm.
The museum acquired 83 drawings from the "Libro" as part of the Pierre Crozat and Carl Gustaf Tessin collections. They include Domenico Ghirlandaio's "", a study for his 1490 painting "An Old Man and his Grandson", now in the Louvre.

Andrei Rabodzeenko

 
Andrei Rabodzeenko (born 1961) is a Russian-American artist.
Personal.
Born in Kyrgyzstan, USSR, he completed his studies at the Mukhina School of Art and Design in Leningrad, USSR (now St. Petersburg Art and Industry Academy). Since 1991, he lives and works in Chicago, Illinois, USA. He is a member of Chicago Sculpture International.
Artwork.
Andrei Rabodzeenko's art focuses on philosophical themes, and has been characterized as capturing the spirit of the times. In his work, he asks "questions that humans have been asking for millennia—questions about ignorance and suffering, faith and pride, ambition and greed. And above all, about divine power. Lots of people steer clear of these deep waters. Yet the ways each generation explores them feed the zeitgeist, or spirit of the times."
Rabodzeenko explores such philosophical themes in different media and styles: painting, drawing, and sculpture. In oils, he paints in two distinct styles, Archetypes and Metaphysics. Archetypes are a realistic-surrealistic style using techniques and images reminiscent of art from the early Italian Renaissance. This work has been described by one critic as expressing humanistic values in allegorical form. Another reviewer points to the fact that although the work initially looks like it is straight from the Renaissance, after closer inspection, the work reveals subtle references to modernity. Metaphysics is a more primitive, symbolic style that mines personal yet universal dream imagery. "Imagine the glowing, contemporary paintings of Mark Rothko, throw in the symbolism of Salvador Dali, and mix it up with some Picasso etchings, and you start to grasp the world of ... artist Andrei Rabodzeenko."
He also creates semi-abstract sculptures out of wood and metal, installations, and graphic work, using ink, charcoal, and chalk on paper.
His paintings, drawings, and sculptures are in private and public collections, including the Loyola University Museum of Art (Chicago), Skokie Northshore Sculpture Park (Skokie, IL), and Emmanuel College, Cambridge University (UK).

Bann Bridge

The Bann Bridge is a railway bridge in Coleraine, County Londonderry. It is the only railway bascule bridge in Northern Ireland.
Design.
The bridge is composed of Dorman Long steel girders on reinforced concrete piers, which themselves rest on precast concrete piles. There are 10 spans about 23m apart, 4 on the Derry side of the lifting span, the lifting span itself, and 5 on the Coleraine side. The lifting span is 25m long, single leaf, and weighs 250 tons, counterbalanced by an underhung concrete block. The bridge carries trains on a single track about 7m above the River Bann and is roughly 5m wide. In total it is 240m long.
History.
The current bridge replaced its predecessor, slightly further upstream, in 1924. It carried the Northern Counties Committee line between Belfast and Derry and cost £100,000 (£5,718,383.23 in 2017).
The bridge was closed in 2012 for refurbishment, which was carried out by F.P. McCann.
The bridge is still in use today, carrying the NI Railways Belfast–Derry line. The lifting span is still operational and a special signalling system prevents trains from being in the section whilst the bridge is open.
