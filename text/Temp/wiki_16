Tara Westover

Tara Westover (born September 27, 1986) is an American memoirist, essayist and historian. Her memoir "Educated" (2018) debuted at No. 1 on "The New York Times" bestseller list and was a finalist for a number of national awards, including the "LA Times" Book Prize, PEN America's Jean Stein Book Award, and two awards from the National Book Critics Circle Award. The "New York Times" ranked "Educated" as one of the 10 Best Books of 2018. Westover was chosen by "Time" magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019.
Early life and education.
Westover was the youngest of seven children born in Clifton, Idaho (population 259) to Mormon survivalist parents. She has five older brothers and an older sister. Her parents were suspicious of doctors, hospitals, public schools, and the federal government. Westover was born at home, delivered by a midwife, and was never taken to a doctor or nurse. She was not registered for a birth certificate until she was nine years old. Their father resisted getting formal medical treatment for any of the family. Even when seriously injured, the children were treated only by their mother, who had studied herbalism and other methods of alternative healing.
All the siblings were loosely homeschooled by their mother. Westover has said an older brother taught her to read, and she studied the scriptures of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But she never attended a lecture, wrote an essay, or took an exam. There were few textbooks in their house.
As a teenager, Westover began to want to enter the larger world and attend college. She purchased textbooks and studied independently in order to score well on the ACT Exam. She gained admission to Brigham Young University and was awarded a scholarship, although she had no high school diploma. After a difficult first year, in which Westover struggled to adjust to academia and the wider society there, she became more successful and graduated with honors in 2008.
She then earned a Masters degree from the University of Cambridge at Trinity College as a Gates Cambridge Scholar, and was a visiting fellow at Harvard University in 2010. She returned to Trinity College, Cambridge, where she earned a doctorate in intellectual history in 2014. Her thesis is entitled "The Family, Morality and Social Science in Anglo-American Cooperative Thought, 1813–1890".
In 2009, while a graduate student at Cambridge, Westover told her parents that for many years (since age 15), she had been physically and psychologically abused by an older brother. Her parents denied her account and suggested that Westover was under the influence of Satan. The family split over these events. Westover wrote about the estrangement, and her unusual path to and through university education in her 2018 memoir, "Educated".
Westover was Fall 2019 A.M. Rosenthal Writer in Residence at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard Kennedy School. She was selected as a Senior Research Fellow at HKS for Spring 2020.
"Educated: A Memoir".
In 2018, Penguin Random House published Westover's "Educated: A Memoir", which tells the story of her struggle to reconcile her desire for education and autonomy with her family's rigid ideology and isolated life. The coming-of-age story was a No. 1 "New York Times" bestseller, and was positively reviewed by the "New York Times"," The Atlantic Monthly", "USA Today", "Vogue", and "The Economist", among others.
, "Educated" has spent two years in hardcover on the "New York Times" bestseller list and is being translated into 45 languages. The book was voted the No. 1 Library Reads pick by American librarians, and in August 2019, it had been checked out more frequently than any other book through all New York Public Library's 88 branches. As of December 2020, "Educated" has sold more than 8 million copies.
Through their attorney, the family has disputed some elements of Westover's book, including her suggestion that her father may have bipolar disorder and that her mother may have suffered a brain injury that resulted in reduced motor skills. Blake Atkin, a lawyer representing Westover's parents, claims that "Educated" creates a distorted picture of the parents. Westover has not responded directly to these claims, but according to the book's acknowledgements, prior to publication it was professionally fact-checked by Ben Phelan of "This American Life" and "GQ".
Awards and recognition.
Westover's book earned her several awards, and other recognition.

National Immunization Technical Advisory Group

National Immunization Technical Advisory Group (NITAG) is an advisory committee consisting of multidisciplinary groups of experts responsible for providing information to national governments that is used to make evidence-based decisions regarding vaccine and immunization policy. The majority of industrialized and some developing countries have formally established advisory committees to guide immunization policies; other countries are working towards establishment of such committees. NITAG in each country may have different names, for example: Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in the United States, Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) in Australia, Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) in the United Kingdom, National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) in Canada, National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) in Ireland, National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI) in India, Standing Committee on Vaccination ("Ständige Impfkommission am Robert-Koch-Institut" / STIKO) in Germany, and Technical Committee of Vaccination ("Comité Technique des Vaccinations" / CTV) in France. 
Purpose.
The primary purpose of NITAG is to provide technical resources, supplying guidance and recommendations to national policy makers and programme managers to enable them to make evidence-based immunization related policy and program decisions. This may also include vaccination schedules regarding appropriate timing, dosage, and contraindications of vaccines. To ensure that the government gives proper attention to NITAG recommendations, NITAG usually report to high level officials of the Ministry of Health.
In immunization related policy, Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) have established mechanisms to synthesize evidence and make global recommendations. Such recommendations will be further interpreted at the country level by NITAGs. As they need to take account of factors such as local disease epidemiology, acceptability of vaccination strategies to local populations, equity in local populations, and programmatic and financial constraints.
NITAG are considered to be functional when they meet six defined process indicators agreed upon by the World Health Organization (WHO), which are:
As of January 2020, there are 151 countries reporting existence of NITAG and 134 countries with NITAG with all six WHO functionality criteria.
Members.
There are no fixed rules about the total number of NITAG members as it depends on local considerations such as the need for geographic representation, the size of the country, and the availability of resources. However, experience has shown that successful NITAG function with about 10–15 members. NITAG members typically consist of multidisciplinary experts and represent a broad range of skills and expertise from the following disciplines/areas: clinical medicine (paediatrics and adolescent medicine, adult medicine, geriatrics), epidemiologists, infectious diseases specialists, microbiologists, public health, immunology, vaccinology, immunization programme, health systems and delivery, clinical research and health economics.

Long Reef (New South Wales)

Long Reef is a prominent headland in the Northern Beaches of Sydney, Australia. Connected to the mainland by a tombolo, the reef has an extensive wave-cut platform. Long Reef is a popular recreational destination and is one of the more interesting geological areas in Sydney.
Geology.
Some of the oldest rocks in the Sydney area may be seen at Long Reef. Primarily from the Triassic they are from the Narrabeen Group of sedimentary rocks. The cliffs of Long Reef are composed of Bald Hill Claystone above Bulgo Sandstone. There was a wide volcanic dyke made of dolerite, two metres tall from the Jurassic. However, this has been reduced by mining. The most commonly seen type of rock in Sydney, Hawkesbury sandstone, is absent at Long Reef. It is present at Dee Why headland, a small distance to the south, separated by a fault under Dee Why beach.
A copper mine was active at Long Reef in the 1880s, after a tunnel was drilled on the southern side. A beach is formed under the cliffs and above the rock platform, with layers of shells and dark minerals. Beach sands include the minerals Ilmenite, rutile, zircon and monazite. The cliffs have evidence of ironstone and laterite, with fallen boulders of the iron rich haematite. Perched water tables produce a number of small freshwater springs on the cliff face. Evidence of faults and folding can be seen at Long Reef. The highest point of Long Reef is composed of Newport Formation sandstone which overlies the Garie Formation.
Fossils.
Extensive rock-falls of grey claystone are found below the cliff face on the southern side. These rocks often contain plant fossils, the commonest being the horsetail, "Phyllotheca". Less often, fossils of a shrub-like seed fern ("Dicroidium") may be found.
In 1986, part of a fossilized mandible (jawbone) of a giant labyrinthodontian amphibian was discovered on Long Reef within the Bulgo sandstone. The complete mandible is estimated to have measured around long. The temnospondyl, dated to the Triassic period, was given the name "Bulgosuchus gargantua". It is only known from Long Reef.
The original Triassic vegetation is oligotrophic forest.
History.
The original human inhabitants were the indigenous Australians, the Kuringgai of the Eora nation. The arrival of white people saw the decimation of the aborigines in the late 18th and early 19th century. Their original name of the area is not known. The first white people to set foot in the area were Governor Arthur Phillip and his exploration team, when travelling north to Broken Bay on 22 August 1788. The name "Long Reef" was in use by 1814.
The shipbuilder William Cossar was granted 500 acres (202 hectares) at Long Reef in 1815. A farm of 52 cleared acres at Long Reef was advertised for sale in 1825. One original fisherman's hut remains at Long Reef, it dates from the 1870s. Long Reef was owned by the Salvation Army from 1900 to 1912.
Ship incidents.
Despite the prominent headland, no lighthouse was built here. A number of shipwrecks and maritime incidents occurred at Long Reef, including the sinking of the "Windsor" in 1816, the "Susannah Cuthbert" in 1875, the "Greyhound" in 1904, the steamer "Duckenfield" which sank in 1889, and the "Sylphide", a barque which sunk off Long Reef in 1877. In the 1970s and 1980s many vessels were intentionally scuttled off Long Reef for the formation of artificial reefs. Prominent among these were the Manly ferries, "Dee Why" and "Bellubera". Others include the 50-metre-long bucket-dredge "Coolooli", the tug boats "Meggol" and "Himma" and "HMAS Doomba". There is a record of 25 shipwrecks and scuttlings associated with Long Reef on the Australian National Shipwreck Database (not including some of those listed above).
SS "Collaroy".
In 1881, the paddle steamer SS "Collaroy", bound for Sydney from Newcastle, changed course in a fog and beached near Long Reef. The ship's mate and ship's master lost their certificates for three months over the incident. The ship was stranded for three years, the wreck giving the name to the Sydney suburb Collaroy. The ship was eventually returned to service, until being wrecked at Eureka Point, California in July 1889.
"Myola" shipwreck.
SS "Myola" was a 655-ton screw steamer, 55 metres long, built in Middlesbrough in the United Kingdom. "Myola" left Newcastle on 1 April 1919 bound for Sydney with a cargo of 675 tons of coal. Off Long Reef, the ship was hit by a large wave and the collier sank. Four miles behind, the steamer "South Bulli" observed distress flares and assisted in picking up survivors. However, four lives were lost. The wreck of "Myola" was found off Long Reef in 1994 in 48 metres of water, lying on its port side.
"Euroka".
The 170 ton iron paddle steamer SS "Euroka" traveled south in 1913 with a cargo of coal loaded at Lake Macquarie. On the voyage to Sydney the steamer ran aground several times. The ship took on water, and captain Benton abandoned the ship at 5pm on 19 October 1913. Eventually, "Euroka" ran aground in five metres of water at Long Reef with no loss of life. The wreck of "Euroka" was sold for £155. Salvaged parts of the ship were removed and sold. Eventually the remains of the vessel were abandoned, and broke up in a wide area. In May 1915, a salvage crew dived on the wreck. They found the wreck of another vessel, another collier, "Susannah Cuthbert", which ran aground on the reef on 7 July 1875.
Recreation and facilities.
Many opportunities exist for recreation at Long Reef. Walking, surfing, swimming, fishing, snorkeling wind surfing, aeromodelling, hang-gliding and exploration of the rock platform at low tide are popular.
Many thousands of school students have visited Long Reef on school excursions. The Long Reef Golf Club was formed in 1921. Public facilities include a viewing platform, public toilets, showers, picnic areas, electric barbecues and a kiosk. Free parking can be difficult on busy days.
Scuba diving and fish.
Scuba diving occurs at "the wall", a long underwater structure. At "the cathedral", two sloping rocks form an open cave resembling a church. "The apartments", with stacked horizontal rocks, allow swim-throughs. The wall is populated by many species of fish, including bull rays, blue devils, snapper, yellowtail kingfish, blue groper, Port Jackson sharks, red morwong, wobbegong, large cuttlefish and the rare grey nurse shark. Large shoals of small fish are also frequently seen in this area, including pomfret, yellowtails and bullseyes.
Birds and sea life.
Long Reef is an important site for many species of migratory shorebirds. Sea birds uncommonly seen in Sydney include the Ruddy turnstone, Bar-tailed godwit, Grey-tailed tattler, Red-necked stint, Black-browed albatross, Little penguin, Sooty oystercatcher, Osprey, Antarctic prion, Red-tailed tropicbird, Double-banded plover and the Pacific golden plover.
A variety of invertebrates live on the reef, some of which may be spotted at low tide. They include sea anemones, barnacles, limpets, chitons, gastropods including cowrys, blue-ringed octopus, nudibranchs, crabs, sea stars, sea urchins, marine worms, cockles, oysters, sea sponges, tube worms, and cunjevoi. Weedy seadragons can be observed by divers. Large areas of Neptune's necklace grow on the reef.
Intertidal rock pools.
Tide pools at Long Reef contain a variety of organisms. Neptune's necklace (Hormosira banksii) is abundant in and around the rock pools. Sea grasses include Zostera capricorni.
Molluscs include the pyramid periwinkle, black nerite, southern periwinkle, zebra top, limpet, false limpet, mulberry whelk, snakehead cowry, cart-wheel, striped-mouth conniwink, lightning turban, military turban, boat shell, blue angel, black-lip abalone and various types of chiton. The blue-ringed octopus is a dangerous resident of rock pools. Occasionally the gloomy octopus will be found in a larger pool. The banded periwinkle may be seen in the splash zone in rock cracks above the rock pools. Another mollusc found in the pools is Thylacodes sipho, known as a "worm shell".
The waratah anemone and green snake lock are common sea anemones. Others include the white-striped anemone and the red anemone.
Sea urchins include the pink sea urchin, Heliocidaris erythrogramma and Heliocidaris erythrogramma. Sea stars include carpet sea star, velvet sea star, brittle star and the dwarf cushion star.
Galeolaria caespitosa is a common tube worm, sometimes known as "Sydney coral". Crabs include decorator crabs, hermit crabs and the purple rock crab. Barnacles in the inter-tidal zone include the rose barnacle and six sided barnacle.
Fish may be isolated in the rock pools at low tide, such as the smooth toadfish (Tetractenos glaber), juvenile mullet and goby (Favonigobius lateralis).
Flora and fauna.
"Themeda" grassland was once common at Long Reef, and in recent years efforts have been made to restore it in some areas. There are also areas of heathland and shrubland with coast tea tree, coast rosemary and coast banksia. An invasive species is bitou bush. The grassy area at Long Reef is a declared "Threatened Ecological Community". Bushcare efforts have been made to reduce invasive weeds and encourage local flora and fauna.
Feral foxes and rabbits have been recorded here. Indigenous fauna occurring at Long Reef includes the jacky lizard, blue tongue lizard, bandicoot and ring tail possum. Between 1998 and 2004, tadpoles of the green and gold bell frog were released into specially designed ponds and dams on Long Reef Golf Course. Little success has been recorded. However, other species of frogs live on Long Reef, such as striped marsh frog, eastern froglet, dwarf tree frog and the emerald-spotted tree frog.

Benjamin Munson (professor)

Benjamin Munson is a professor and chair of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences University of Minnesota. His research relates to relationships among speech perception, speech production, and vocabulary growth in children. The bulk of his research has examined how speech perception, production, and word knowledge interact during development in typically developing children, in children with Speech Sound Disorder, in children with Developmental Language Disorder, in adult second-language learners, and in adults with age-related hearing impairment. He has also studied how people convey and perceive sexuality through phonetic variation. 
In research presented at the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 2018, he revealed that the voices of boys and girls were identifiably different even before puberty with the boys' voices being lower and boys that were gender dysphoric showing traits more associated with women.
Munson received his BA in Russian and Political Science from State University of New York at Buffalo (1992), his MA in speech-language pathology from Ohio State University (1997) and his PhD in speech and hearing science also from Ohio State. Prior to entering academia, he was a political activist. He was arrested at the 1992 Republican National Convention while protesting President George H.W. Bush with the group ACT-UP (he can be seen yelling "what about AIDS?" at the 2:40 mark in this C-SPAN video). Following this event, he served a brief sentence at the Harris County Jail.

First Church of Christ, Scientist (Cedar Rapids, Iowa)

The former First Church of Christ, Scientist, also known as The City Church, is located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, United States. Christian Science began in Boston in 1866 and it was introduced to Cedar Rapids twenty years later. A Sunday School was established in 1887 and it met at the old Dows Auditorium at Third Avenue and Third Street SE. The congregation was established in 1891 as an official branch of The First Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston. It was the first Christian Science congregation established in Iowa. They held their Wednesday evening services at the Peoples Unitarian Universalist Church. The congregation began construction on this building in 1914 and it was dedicated on Easter Sunday the following year. It is a red brick structure in the Neoclassical style. The rectangular building features a portico with four columns in the Doric order on the main facade, and a centered raised gable roof with cornice returns. The architectural style was chosen to "attract non-churchgoing people that may be intimidated by traditional religious structures." The congregation has subsequently moved to a new facility on Blairs Ferry Road, NE. This building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.

Siege of Vladimir

The siege of Vladimir was part of the Mongol invasion of Rus.
Prelude.
After the destruction of Ryazan on December 21, 1237, Grand Prince Yuri II left the capital city of Vladimir in charge of his son Vsevolod and fled to Yaroslavl, seeking help from his cousins, Princes of Rostov and Novgorod. However, the speed of the Mongols was such that Kolomna fell barely 10 days after Ryazan, and Moscow only 3 weeks later, leaving the people of Vladimir to fend for themselves.
Siege.
The defense of Vladimir was entrusted to the Grand Prince's sons Vsevolod and Mstislav, but their forces were weak, as most of the army perished at the siege of Kolomna, hoping to stop the invaders on the border. Thus, after receiving word of the destruction of Kolomna in January 1238, Bishop Mitrofan let most of the citizens take monastic vows in order to prepare for their imminent death. After weak resistance the city was taken on February 8, 1238.
Aftermath.
Receiving word of the siege of Vladimir, Grand Prince Yuri II attempted to reach the city and break the siege, but his small army was surrounded and defeated at the Battle of the Sit River.

Talbart Talbardon was mercenary captain in the Hundred Year War. He was also called Taillevardon and was one of several "men-at-arms plundering the whole country ... " according to a letter from that year.
In 1363 he was a squire of Philip the Bold, the king's lieutenant.
When the Treaty of Brétigny was signed on 8 May 1360 he was left without employment, and joined the roaming bands of displaced mercenaries who began to plunder the French country side.
According to William Paradin, King John II the Good had him hanged in 1362 at Trishastel along with 
Guillaume Pot and Jean de Chauffour. However, Guillaume Pot is known to have lived until at least 1367 and Jean de Chauffour was beheaded in Langres in the middle of 1364.

Isaac Smith Jr.

Isaac Smith Jr. (May 18, 1749 – September 29/30, 1829) was an American librarian, minister, and educator.
Smith, the son of the prosperous Boston merchant Isaac Smith Sr. and Elizabeth Storer Smith, was born May 18, 1749. At the age of fourteen he entered Harvard College with the class of 1767. After taking his second degree, and preparing for the ministry, he traveled in Europe for some years. Returning to this country, he was appointed, in 1774, a tutor at Harvard, but the position he was not destined to hold long. 
Smith was a firm loyalist, and when on April 19, 1775, Lord Percy marched through Cambridge to reinforce the British troops at Lexington and Concord, the young tutor was the only person in Cambridge willing to show the puzzled leader, confused by the number of roads branching off from the Boston Common, which one to take for Lexington. Being for this service to the enemy almost ostracized by the good people of Cambridge, he was glad to sail a month later for England with many other exiled loyalists.
After living a few years in London, he was ordained (June 24, 1778) pastor over a dissenting church in the little town of Sidmouth in Devonshire. Of his pleasant life there, in a comfortable home, with congenial society and light parish duties, we get glimpses in the published Journal and letters of his fellow exile, Samuel Curwen.
In the spring of 1784, resigning his pastorate, he returned to America. In August 1787, Smith was appointed Librarian of Harvard College, although he did not sign the formal engagement until the next March. In May 1789, the Harvard Corporation allowed him £13.13s. "for instructing the classes in Latin for six weeks and an half in the third term, three times a day, being seven dollars per week." The third printed catalogue of the Library appeared the next year: "Catalogus Bibliothecae Harvardianas Cantabrigiae Nov-Anglorum". Bostoniae : Typis Thomas et Johannis Fleet. MDCCXC. The Latin preface says: "Ut ista omnibus, qui ei consulere velint, utilior fieret, libri alphabetice sub diversis capitibus, secundum propria eorum genera, in hoc catalogo disponuntur." The first, or general, part of the catalogue is divided into fifty-four classes in alphabetical order, and the books under each are also alphabetically arranged. About one fourth of the titles are under "Theologia"; yet the names of Shakespeare, Milton, Ben Johnson, Pope, "The Tatler," "The Spectator", Racine, Rabelais, and Cervantes show that was not wholly neglected. In the second part of the catalogue, which is devoted to "Tracts," out of 150 pages, theology occupies over 100. In the preparation of this catalogue Smith had the aid of Prof. Stephen Sewall, (Librarian 1762–63) and Hezekiah Packard (class of 1787). The latter was an assistant in the Library; in his memoirs he says: "The next year [1789] I took charge of the Library as an assistant." For his services in preparing this catalogue Smith was allowed by the Corporation in April 1791, the sum of £37.10s. in addition to his regular salary.
In April 1790, the trustees of Dummer Academy, at Byfield, Massachusetts, elected Isaac Smith preceptor of that institution, but it was nearly a year before he entered on his duties there, March 25, 1791. The Academy was not successful under his management; his good nature and easy-going ways were not those of a good teacher or a strict disciplinarian; the school fell off greatly in numbers, and it was not strange that, in April 1809, the trustees accepted his resignation. He removed to Boston where he was appointed chaplain of the Almshouse, a position which he held for many years.
He was never married, and died in Boston on September 29 or 30, 1829, at the age of 80.
One of his scholars, writing years afterward, recalls him as "a short, nice, rubicund, but kindly and scholarly-looking old gentleman." "In spirit" says another writer, "he was mild and tolerant ; in creed, broad and liberal." He was "a man of singular purity, gentleness, and piety." Besides the Catalogue mentioned above, his only publication seems to be "A sermon preached at Cambridge, May 5th, 1788 on occasion of the death of Mr. Ebenezer Grosvenor", student at Harvard.

Trump vs. Bernie

Trump vs. Bernie is a satirical comedy act created by Anthony Atamanuik and James Adomian that imagines a series of fictional presidential debates between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election. In a deliberately absurd anachronism, "Trump" (Atamanuik) and "Bernie" (Adomian) engage in inter-party debates long before their parties' nominations are decided. Originating in October 2015 as a live sketch at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre (UCB) in New York, "Trump vs. Bernie" continued throughout the 2016 election season as a 40-city live comedy debate tour and spawned a special one-hour appearance on Comedy Central's @midnight, two hour-long specials produced for Fusion, and a comedy album released by Comedy Dynamics, along with numerous appearances on news and comedy programs, radio shows, and podcasts.
Background.
Adomian began impersonating Sanders in May 2015, making an appearance on Dan Harmon's podcast "Harmontown" and in a Funny or Die short with a television debut on a September episode of @midnight. Atamanuik performed as Trump at various improv shows starting in August 2015, resulting in a one-man show at UCB New York entitled "Trump Dump." The duo, having known each other from the improv scene since 2008, connected to stage a fake debate in a one-off live sketch on October 12, 2015 at UCB's stand-up showcase """Whiplash." An edited video of the performance uploaded to YouTube was well-received by websites like Salon and Daily Dot, which lead to a subsequent show at the New York Comedy Festival, where the "debate" was moderated by The Daily Show correspondent Hasan Minhaj.
"Trump vs. Bernie" Debate Tour 2016.
In January 2016, dates for an initial 12-city US debate tour were announced. Debates were held in Portsmouth and Manchester a day before the New Hampshire presidential primaries that both the real Trump and Sanders won. The tour grew to a total of 40 cities and had an international leg in Amsterdam, Dublin, London, and Montreal. Each debate was moderated by a celebrity guest such as Baratunde Thurston, Andy Richter and Mark Hamill. The tour concluded at the Just for Laughs Festival in Montreal where Atamanuik and Adomian were honored as two of "Variety" magazine's 10 Comics to Watch for 2016.
@midnight guest appearance.
On March 23, 2016, @midnight deviated from its usual three-person panel game format to host an hour-long "Trump vs. Bernie" debate moderated by host Chris Hardwick. According to Hardwick, a Comedy Central executive present at the taping decided to preempt originally scheduled programming to extend the 30 minute show to an hour because he was so impressed. Billed as "socialist vs. sociopath," the episode was subsequently posted to YouTube and has amassed over 7 million views.
Fusion television specials.
On Super Tuesday, the Fusion network ordered an hour-long debate special and hour-long sketch show special based on the act along with digital content that began with a livestream on Fusion's F-Comedy Facebook page later that night.
"Trump vs. Bernie: Debate for America" (2016).
The debate special aired April 27, 2016. It is moderated by Paul F. Tompkins, Brianna Baker, and Rhea Butcher. Betsy Sodaro plays a protester who heckles Trump throughout the debate. When Sodaro storms the stage, Trump brandishes a gun and shoots her. The special ends with Bernie rushing to Sodaro and tackling Trump.
"Trump vs. Bernie: Shout the Vote!" (2016).
"Trump vs. Bernie: Shout the Vote!" aired later the next month on May 11, 2016. Presented as "Loudbox," a cable news program hosted by Rachel Maddow (Atamanuik) and Chris Matthews (Adomian) with panelists Donna Brazile (Nicole Byer), Jeb Bush (Daniel Van Kirk), and Ben Carson (Jerry Minor), the pundits ignore an impending cataclysmic asteroid strike in favor of political optics while throwing to interviews and field pieces with Trump and Bernie. Atamanuik also impersonates alleged serial killer Robert Durst while Adomian plays former Governor of Minnesota Jesse Ventura.
"Live from Brooklyn" (comedy album).
Comedy Dynamics released "Trump vs. Bernie: Live from Brooklyn Starring Anthony Atamanuik and James Adomian" on July 29, 2016 on vinyl as well as on iTunes and other streaming services. The album featured a tour debate moderated by the Huffington Post's Howard Fineman. It debuted at #5 on Billboard's Comedy Album charts. 
Other media appearances.
Atamanuik and Adomian promoted the debate tour in character on an episode of "Comedy Bang! Bang!" that also features Gilbert Gottfried. On February 12, 2016, a week after the New Hampshire primary, CNN's Brooke Baldwin interviewed Atamanuik and Adomian on Newsroom as if they were the real life candidates. The duo has appeared on The Howard Stern Show twice: first in June 2016 and again after the election of Donald Trump.
Reception.
Both Atamanuik and Adomian have received praise for their portrayals. Critic for "The New York Times" Jason Zinoman said of their initial debate, "The best sketch about the current political campaign that I've seen this year was not on 'Saturday Night Live.'" Dan Caffrey of The A.V. Club credits Atamanuik with taking a "psychological approach" with "moments of self-awareness" that allows him explore the emptiness of Trump's soul. Both Salon and Huffington Post called Adomian's Sanders better than Larry David's, which Jené Gutierrez of the Daily Dot attributed to his ability to not only capture the essence of Sanders, but to bolster it with improvisation that "communicates complex issues in an accessible way" and transforms it into "smart and subtly flattering comedy." Comedian Patton Oswalt agreed saying, "[James Adomian] and [Anthony Atamanuik] are the scary best at everything. Actor Mark Hamill said of the routine, "Beyond hilarious! On a scale of 1-10, it's an 11! TREMENDOUS Trump. BRILLIANT Bernie."
Aftermath.
After the election of Donald Trump, Comedy Central premiered "The President Show" on April 27, 2017 as a weekly late-night show starring Atamanuik. Adomian reprised his role as Bernie on an episode of the show as well as on its one-hour special "I Came Up With Christmas."

François de Surienne

François de Surienne ( – 8 April 1462) was a Spanish mercenary and engineer, a specialist in fortification and artillery, who was active in Normandy and Burgundy in the 15th century. He was lord of Pisy and of Châtel-Gérard as well as "bailli" of Chartres and of Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier. His name is generally given in Spanish as Francisco de Soriano, Sarriera, Sariñera, Siurana, and Sureda. Since he was born in Aragon, he was also known in France by his demonym, the Aragonese ().
A mercenary and adventurer, Surienne fought in the Hundred Years' War on the side of the English, becoming a trusted captain and agent. His services and familial connections earned him a number of titles, lands, and important offices in France.
Surienne is noted for launching an attack on Fougères, Brittany, in 1449, a move which precipitated the formal breaking of an ongoing truce between the English and the French. The failure of the English to support him prompted Surienne to sever ties with England, and he served Charles VII of France for the remainder of his life.
Origin and family.
"François de Surienne" is a corruption in French of his native name, which has multiple variants due to the diversity of dialects in his native country of Aragon. Soriano, Sarriera, Sariñera, Siurana, and Sureda all feature among sources as his surname.
He was a nephew of , who held Passy castle, through his marriage on 4 June 1426 to Étiennette de Grésille. He was perhaps related to the Borgia, and possibly the uncle of Rodrigo Borgia, who became Pope in 1492 under the name Alexander VI. His daughter Jeanne married Richard Aux-Épaules, a faithful Surienne retainer, châtelain of Longny for his father-in-law.
Biography.
Titles.
De Surienne, known as "the Aragonese" was lord of Pisy, Châtel-Gérard, and Loigny (Lunée), bailiff of Chartres and Saint-Pierre-le-Moûtier, and captain of Montargis, Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Pont-Audemer. He was also governor of Le Mans, constable of Portchester Castle, governor of Lower Normandy for the king of England, knight of the Garter, adviser to the king of England, Councilor and Chamberlain of the Duke of Burgundy, and grand master of the ducal artillery.
Siege of Fougères.
François de Surienne was made a Knight of the Garter on 27 November 1447. At the time he was an adventurer in the pay of the English, and took thirty-two towns before, on 23 March 1449, he seized the Breton town of Fougères while a truce between France and England was in force. This action became a pretext to break the truce, triggering the last phase of the Hundred Years' War. He launched this attack from the city of Condé-sur-Noireau, which was under the lordship of the Englishman Sir John Fastolf of Caister Castle, Norfolk (1380-1459).
Later career with the English.
In 1461, he was bailiff of Chartres
King Alfonso V of Aragon sent a letter to the King of France, Charles VII, on 10 November 1450, which recommended Franciscus Dictus Arragonennsis.
Modernising the fortifications of Dijon from 1461, he then improved the defences of the castle of Fougères by reinforcing the ancient fortifications by placing works in front, thus protecting the old walls. The torn outline then appears in some parts of the fortification, in particular the weak points.
Career with the Burgandians.
Renowned as among the most valiant men of war of his time, after twenty years in the service of King of England, he entered the service of Duke Philip III of Burgundy, and accompanied him as governor during the campaign against Ghent.
The years of peace during which he was in charge of the artillery enabled him to bring about equipment improvements which the experience of past wars seemed to indicate: the invention of trunnions and, consequently, that of the flanged carriages seem belong to that time.
He died on 8 April 1462, aged 64, and was succeeded by Messire Waleran de Soissons.

Whaling in the United Kingdom

Commercial whaling in Britain began late in the 16th century and continued after the 1801 formation of the United Kingdom and intermittently until the middle of the 20th century.
The trade was broadly divided into two branches. The northern fishery involved hunting the bowhead whale off the coast of Greenland and adjacent islands. The southern fishery was activity anywhere else, including in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian Oceans and off the Antarctic. The Sperm whale, the Southern right whale and Humpback whale were the main target species in South Sea whaling. The industry went on to become a profitable national enterprise and a source of skilled mariners for the Royal Navy in times of war.
Modern whaling, using factory ships and catchers fitted with bow-mounted cannon that fired explosive harpoons, continued into the 20th century and was mainly focused on the Antarctic and nearby islands where shore stations had been established. The collapse of whale stocks in the 1960s, due to overfishing, saw Britain abandon the industry after three and a half centuries of involvement.
Early history.
Stranded whales, or drift whales that died at sea and washed ashore, provided meat, blubber (rendered into oil) and bone to coastal communities in pre-historic Britain. A 5,000 year old whalebone figurine was one of the many items found in the Neolithic village of Skara Brae in Scotland after that stone age settlement was uncovered by a storm in the 1850s. Whalebone weaving combs from the middle and late Iron Age have been found on archaeological digs in Orkney and Somerset. 
A charter granted to Hilary, Bishop of Chichester in 1148 gave him the right to “any whale found on the land of the church of Chichester, except the tongue, which is the King's.” The English king had asserted the right to the entire whale by 1315 when Edward II reserved “to himself the right of all whales cast by chance upon the shore.” Whales came to be known as “Royal fish”, the disposal of which was an exclusive right of the monarch, or his local representative. Indeed, to this day, the Crown Estate asserts that "theoretically The Queen can claim ownership" of beached whales and other "Royal fish".
The first tentative interest in commercial whaling may have occurred in 1576 when a British vessel sailed “to the country called Labrador, which joins Newfoundland, where the Biscay men go in search of whales.” The Basques had whaled in the Bay of Biscay from the twelfth century and by the middle of the sixteenth century were crossing the Atlantic each year to the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland where they established temporary whaling settlements. Sustained British interest in the trade began in 1577 when the Muscovy Company in London was granted a Crown monopoly to hunt whales “within any seas whatsoever.” It may have been further stimulated when, for political reasons, parliament banned whale oil imports from the Spanish Basque country, the main whale oil exporters, in 1579.
The northern whale fishery.
A vessel owned by the London-based Muscovy Company discovered and began to exploit the Spitsbergen (Svalbard) whaling grounds in 1611. By 1617 at least fifteen British vessels were whaling off Spitsbergen each season. Ongoing participation in the fishery proved elusive. It was due, in part, to costly competition between rival chartered companies as they tried to exclude each other, and their foreign rivals, from the region. In the meantime, the Dutch had entered the fishery and soon became dominant. By the 1660s, there were hundreds of Dutch and German vessels active off Spitsbergen, while in some years not a single British vessel.
Parliament tried to revive British involvement late in the 17th century. It began with legislation in 1672 that allowed British whaling crews to be composed of up to half foreign nationals, such as the skilled Dutch. The Act also exempted British-caught oil from customs duty, and imposed a £9 a tun duty on oil and £18 on “whale fins” (baleen) imported from other national fleets. It was not till Dutch involvement began to falter in the 1690s, due to political turmoil and warfare in Holland, that the British saw an opportunity, which led to the creation of the Greenland Company. The initiative was unsuccessful and the losses incurred were so large they discouraged further British involvement in the trade till the 1720s, when Henry Elking persuaded the South Sea Company to try the Spitsbergen fishery. Two dozen new vessels were built and equipped and sent forth under the direction of Elking as agent and superintendent for the Greenland Fishery on a salary of £100 a year plus 1.5% of gross sales. This initiative too was unsuccessful and spelled the end of chartered company involvement in the trade in Britain.
Parliament wanted to revive whaling to reduce the trade imbalance with Holland and at the same time build up a naval reserve of ships and men that could be easily mobilised in times of war. In 1732 it offered an annual bounty of twenty shillings (one pound sterling) a ton for all whaling vessels over 200 tons fitted out in Great Britain, the relevant legislation coming into force in 1733. The bounty was increased to thirty shillings a ton in 1740, but even then only four or five British vessels sailed north each year. Most of these were owned by merchants who imported whale oil.
The government increased the bounty to forty shillings a ton in 1750 and this proved the tipping point for a take off in the trade. Just two ships were fitted out in 1749, increasing to twenty in 1750, and eighty-three by 1756. The forty shillings a ton bounty represented a subsidy of £600 for the average-sized 300-ton ship in the trade. Also important was a jump in demand for whale oil. The manufacture of woollen textiles was increasing and right whale oil was widely used to clean wool before it was spun. The Industrial Revolution needed lubricants for machinery, and growing urbanization increased the demand for lamp fuel, including in street lighting. London was the best lit city in the world, with 5000 street lamps by the 1740s. The building industry also used whale oil as an ingredient in paint, varnish and putty. All of this increase in demand led to a rise in price. The average wholesale price was £14 7s a tun early in the 1740s and this rose to £27 a tun in 1754. At the same time Dutch had started to withdraw from the fishery.
Scottish ports were well placed to participate in the growth of the fleet. They were closer to the northern whaling grounds and sent forth more whalers to the Arctic than English outports early in this revival of interest in the trade. Scottish ports involved in the trade, in order of importance, were, Leith, Dunbar, Barrowstoness, Dundee, Aberdeen, Montrose, Glasgow, Anstruther, Greenock, Kirkcaldy and Alloa.
London remained the single most important port dispatching 71% of British whalers in 1753. Other English ports involved include Hull (from 1598), Newcastle (1752), Whitby (1753), Exeter (1754), Ipswich (1786) and Peterhead (1788). Additional English and Welsh ports participating during the “bounty period” (1733-1824) were Berwick, Dartmouth, Grimsby, Liverpool, Lynn, Milford, Scarborough, Stockton, Sunderland, Whitehaven and Yarmouth.
There were setbacks along the way. These included war in Europe in 1756, which saw the crews of some northern whalers depleted by the press-gangs, regardless of exemptions granted to harpooners, line-managers and boatsteerers A fall in the price of oil at the same time also impacted the industry and led shipowners to leave the trade. There were eighty-three vessels involved in 1759, and just forty when the war ended in 1763. Whaling remained at a low ebb for the next decade with some ports, such as Whitby and Hull, leaving the trade entirely for a time. Numbers slowly increased till there were fifty vessels involved by 1770.
The American Revolutionary War (1775-1783) acted as another break on northern whaling. When peace came in 1783 it was followed by an expansion in the British economy and a renewed demand for whale oil. America had been a major supplier to Britain, especially of sperm whale oil. Britain started to participate in the sperm whale fishery in 1775 and imposed a heavy duty on oil imported from elsewhere. The high tariff barrier remained after peace was declared and acted as an accelerent to British involvement in South Sea whaling. British activity in the Arctic also began to increase. The number of Greenland whalers rose from 44 in 1782 to 102 in 1784. The Greenland fishery peaked in 1786-1788 when 250 British vessels were involved with an aggregate tonnage of 73,000 and employing about 10,000 men. Those vessels came from 23 different ports, with London alone sending 91 vessels, followed by Hull with 36 and Whitby and Newcastle with twenty each. The year 1788 was also one of massive loss with the fleet as a whole recording a deficit of £199,371, the London vessels by themselves losing £40,000. Vessels began to leave the trade and by 1790 only eleven ports were still involved.
The number of vessels involved in northern whaling slowly picked up as the turn of the century approached, largely unaffected by the French Revolutionary period and Napoleonic Wars. The price of oil and bone was volatile and the latter ranged in price from £400 a ton to just £30 between the 1760s and 1815. Prices began to improve as the new century progressed and the Davis Strait fishery began to develop. The size of the fleet peaked in 1821 after which it began a long slow decline that lasted until the end of the century.
The decline began when the Board of Trade introduced free trade legislation that removed the bounty in 1824. Also significant was a fall in the price of whale oil to just £18 in 1820-21 season, in response to weak demand caused by a rise in imports of seed oil. More free trade legislation in 1844 saw the high duty on American-caught whale oil reduced from £27 18s 7d per tun to just £6 6s, and the duty on sperm oil fall to £15 15s. The duty reduction benefited consumers of whale oil but it exposed the whaling industry to the cold winds of competition, and it withered in response.
Poor seasons became more common as whale stocks declined, further hastening the exit from the industry. The vessels still engaged stayed longer on the whaling grounds to achieve better results and in the process were sometimes trapped by the ice. Forced to over-winter, some ships were crushed by the ice and their crewmen had to evacuate the ship. If there was no vessel nearby to take them aboard they would soon freeze to death. Even those taken aboard another vessel faced scurvy or starvation in crowded unsanitary conditions till the ice began to break up and the vessel could begin the journey home.
The southern whale fishery.
Sperm whale oil - a valuable commodity worth two or three times more than northern right whale oil - had been imported from Britain’s New England colonies till the American War of Independence curtailed supply. This prompted British entrepreneurs, particularly those who had previously imported the oil, to send their own ships into the South Seas to obtain this high-value commodity. Ten whalers left Britain in 1775, including nine from London, and crossed the equator into the South Atlantic in search of sperm whales. London alone sent 76 whaling vessels into the south Atlantic between 1776 and 1783. British vessels went on to make around 2,500 voyages whaling and sealing voyages to the South Seas between 1775 and 1859. These voyages were made by over 930 vessels owned by 300 principal shipowners. Some of these vessels in the South Atlantic also engaged in clandestine trading on the coast of Brazil. A group of American Quaker whalers, led by William Rotch, senior (1734-1828) of Nantucket, then the hub of the American whaling industry, sought to evade British naval blockades of American ports, and the high duty on imported foreign whale oil, by relocating, first to France, and then to Britain. The Rotch family owned at least ten British South Sea whalers between 1775 and 1794.
The British ships initially “fished” in the mid and south Atlantic, spreading into the Pacific and Indian Oceans in the 1780s. The government bounty of forty shillings a ton paid to northern whalers was extended to the southern fishery in 1776. A heavy import duty that applied to oil imported from other countries was not lifted even after hostilities between Britain and America ceased in 1783 and was an additional incentive for shipowners to remain involved in the trade. The first British whaler to enter the Pacific was the "Emilia", owned by Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons and commanded by Captain James Shields. This vessel sailed from London in September 1788 and fished the Peru Grounds before returning to London in March 1790 with 139 tons of sperm whale oil.
International conflict became inevitable, spilling over all the continents of the New World. Spain resented the intrusion of British vessels into the Pacific, especially when they engaged in clandestine trading at Spanish colonies in South America. In 1789, rising tension over the issue saw Spanish warships, thousands of miles away on the west coast of what is now Canada, seize British vessels engaged in the maritime fur trade in Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. The resulting Nootka Crisis was an international incident that brought both nations to the brink of war. War was averted but tensions remained high. Australia was also in their sights. In 1793 a Spanish naval captain with recent knowledge of the area submitted a plan to invade New South Wales, destroy Sydney and carry away the 7,000 colonists to labour in Spain's own South American colonies.
British whaling continued in the Pacific, with occasional setbacks along the way. These include the Anglo-French War (1778-1783), the Anglo-Spanish War (1796-1808) and the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States. These conflicts forced vessels to travel to and from the whaling grounds in convoys protected by Royal Navy warships. This was not always enough and in 1797 a number of the British whalers were captured when they called at ports on the coast of Chile and Peru for supplies, unaware that war had broken out between Spain and Britain. The US warship "Essex" captured a dozen British whalers in the Pacific in 1812, the loss in ships and cargo estimated at $2.5 million. As well as a problem, these conflicts also presented opportunities for British whalers. Many of them sailed for the Pacific with Letters of Marque obtained from the government, allowing them to attack, capture and plunder enemy-owned trading vessels.
Another significant barrier to expansion were Crown monopolies granted to the East India Company and the South Sea Company which restricted British maritime activity in the Pacific and Indian Oceans to ships owned or licensed by the Companies. Pressure exerted by the London whaling lobby saw these restrictions gradually lifted between 1786 and 1813, after which British whalers had unrestricted access to all whaling grounds.
Some whaling shipowners, such as Samuel Enderby &amp; Sons and Mather &amp; Co., chartered their vessels to serve as convict transports and store ships to the Australian colonies on the outward voyage to the South Seas. Others took with them trade goods they sold in the colonies, or at ports in South America. Contraband trading at South American ports and bays could be lucrative but, if detected by the Spanish colonial authorities, might result in confiscation of the ship and a lengthy period of imprisonment for the crews.
In the years between 1800 and 1809 the British South Sea whaling fleet averaged 72 vessels with 30 ships returning each year. The annual average catch during this period was 1,634 tuns of sperm and 3,300 tuns of southern right whale oil, with an average annual value of £122,000. British involvement in the South Seas fishery reached its peak, in terms of the number of vessels involved, in the years between 1820 and 1822. The end of subsidy payments in 1824 played a part in the decline, as did the reduction in the duty on imported foreign-caught oil in 1843, and its total abolition in 1849. A decline in whale stocks was also a significant factor and caused a steady increase in the length of voyages. By 1843, only 36 vessels were still involved in the trade, and just 20 by 1850. The last British vessel involved in South Sea whaling in the Age of Sail was the "Cowlitz" (Captain Bushell) which returned to London in 1859. As well as the Enderby family, other prominent shipowners in the southern whale fishery included Daniel Bennett, Alexander Champion, John St Barbe and Thomas Sturge.
Modern whaling.
The development of harpoons went hand in hand with the development of commercial whaling. Harpoon guns were trialed by the South Sea Company in 1737 and hand-held guns that discharged rocket harpoons were in general use by American and other national whalers in the second half of the 19th century. Further experimentation at that period by Svend Foyn at Tonsberg in Norway resulted in a safer and more efficient harpoon cannon that was patented in 1870. These cannon were mounted on the bow of steam-powered metal-hulled catchers and allowed faster whale species to be hunted. The introduction of factory ships that could winch the captured whales up a stern ramp and onto the deck meant further advances in efficiency and safety for those employed in the industry.
Modern whaling in Britain can be dated from 1904, when Norwegian expatriate Christian Salvesen at Leith in Scotland established the Olna Whaling Company. Shore-based whaling stations established at Olna Firth and elsewhere in Scotland were highly productive, taking 2,418 Fin and 1,283 Sei whales between 1908 and 1914, inclusive. After the oil was extracted, the meat and bone was ground into a meal used as an animal food supplement. Salvesen later established other stations at Thorvig in the Faroe Islands and at Hellisford in Iceland. Modern whaling methods soon depleted whaling stocks in European waters and companies began to look further afield. The Dundee whaling expedition set out from Scotland and ventured to the Antarctic in 1892-93 to look for whaling grounds that might be worth fishing.
The first modern shore-based whaling station in the southern hemisphere was established at Grytviken on South Georgia by an Argentine company in 1904. There were nineteen whaling firms in the region by 1914, most of them owned or staffed by Norwegians. Christian Salvesen established a new whaling company in 1908 which began operations at West Falkland in January 1909 and, later in the year, at South Georgia. The latter operation was based at Leith Harbour and it continued to function till the 1960s. The official language there was Norwegian, indicating the main source of labour. A second British firm, the Southern Whaling and Sealing Company of North Shields, was established in 1911 to operate at Prince Olav Harbour on South Georgia. 
Old merchant vessels of 2000-3000 tons were brought into service as rudimentary factory ships by the Norwegians in 1905, and by the British in 1911. These vessels allowed the whole whale to be processed with less waste. The start of World War I led to an increased demand for whaling products, and catches by the two British firms in the Antarctic increased in response. Advances in hydrogenation allowed the oil from baleen whales to be hardened to make margarine, a substitute for butter, in short supply due to the war. The hardened whale oil was also used to make soap, with Lever Brothers the major user of whale oil in Britain.
A major event in the post-war years was the purchase of the Southern Whaling Company by Lever Brothers for £360,000 in September 1919. The Southern Whaling and Sealing Company and Christian Salvesen were the two main producers of whale oil from shore-based whaling stations and floating factory ships in the Antarctic in the early 1920s. Other significant developments were the introduction of larger catchers, that could range further, and a switch in target species from fin whales to blue whales.
The depletion of South Georgia waters by the 1920s saw British companies invest in new factory ships that could be sent to whaling grounds further afield during the brief three month long Antarctic whaling season. The waters around the South Shetland Islands and South Orkney Islands were tried but the major development in the 1920s was the discovery by the Norwegian, Captain Carl Anton Larsen in the 1923-24 season, of a passage through the pack ice to the ice-free waters of the Ross Sea. The difficult conditions in the Ross Sea called for larger factory ships and more powerful catchers. Christian Salvesen took delivery of six new catchers in 1924, the first of forty catchers commissioned and built at Middlesbrough for them during the inter-war years. The profits in the industry saw the creation of a third British firm in 1928, the Hector Whaling Company, with a nominal capital of £250,000.
An increase in the number of factory ships from 17 to 41, most of them deployed to the Ross Sea, saw total world whale oil production explode from 145,394 tons in 1926-27 to 601,392 tons in the 1930-31 season, while the British component went from 61,781 tons to 120,533 tons during the same period. This massive oversupply led to a rise in inventories and a dramatic fall in price which resulted in the decision by the Norwegians to keep their vessels in port for the 1931-32 season. British producers responded by closing two unprofitable shore-based stations in Scotland and another in South Africa.
Continued overfishing and the resulting depletion of whale stocks in Antarctic waters turned thoughts to greater regulation and how the industry might be made sustainable. Efforts were made to further limit the length of the whaling season and quotas were introduced on the number of whales that could be taken. More effective in limiting the catch was the ongoing surplus of oil in storage and the resulting low price that continued to restrict the number of factory ships at sea. This continued until 1935, when a rise in the price of oil saw an increase in the number of ships to sail. Some of these "fished" the whaling grounds off Western Australia, Peru and Madagascar. The old cycle was soon repeated with overproduction and the inevitable crash in the oil price.
The oil surplus of the 1935-36 season was the result of good weather in the Antarctic and the activity of new whaling factories and catchers, including some from Japan, Germany and Denmark, new entrants into modern whaling. It also reflected the creation of a number of new small whaling companies in Britain during the 1930s. These included Anglo-Norse Ltd, Polar Whaling Company and Star Whaling. There were still nine British shore-based whaling stations operating in the 1930s. To maintain production levels, the target species broadened, with fin, humpback and sperm whales taken in increasing numbers. Even so, on the eve of world war in 1939 the industry was facing difficult times with declining whale stocks, rising costs and falling demand as manufacturers switched to whale oil substitutes, such as palm oil.
The Second World War devastated the whaling industry. The European market for British-caught oil disappeared almost overnight. But a new market opened up as the British government began to buy and stockpile any whale oil they could lay their hands on. When the Minister of Food, Sir Frederick Marquis heard rumors the Germans were negotiating to buy whale oil from the Norwegians, to be made into margarine, he made contact with the traders and agreed the first price quoted and bought their entire stock and had it transported to Britain. Whale catchers and factory ships were requisitioned for military purposes and a number were sunk by enemy action. Whale numbers around the world recovered slightly during the conflict. When the Second World War ended, the war on the whales began again.
An urgent need for edible oils of all kinds in the post-war period saw the price of whale oil reach £100 a ton on several occasions between 1945 and 1952 and prompted a resurgence in the industry. Some of the vessels sent south had been seized from Germany as enemy property while other factories and catchers were newly built. British companies produced 39,708 tons of oil in the 1945-46 season, rising to 89,012 tons in 1948-49. The renewed activity by British, Norwegian and other producers postponed any plans for regulations to limit the number of whales taken and make the industry sustainable.
The International Whaling Commission reduced the length of the whaling season in the late 1940s, and also introduced catch limits. The quotas were set too high and, in any case, were ignored by some operators. Attempts were made to expand the market for whale meat in Britain by marketing it for human consumption, but were unsuccessful. After the oil was extracted most of the residue continued to be processed into low-value meat meal to feed livestock.
The value of whale oil peaked in 1950-1952, in anticipation of strong demand during the Korean War, and then began to decline. The British share of the catch fell after 1954 and companies based in the United Kingdom started to think about how to exit the industry. Hector Whaling did so in 1960 and Salvesen in 1963, bringing to an end three and a half centuries of British involvement. Whaling product imports were banned in Britain in 1973. A massive decline in whale numbers had made the industry uneconomic and the International Whaling Commission introduced a moratorium on commercial whaling in 1982. Britain was one of 25 members of the Commission to successfully approve the moratorium, which went into effect in 1986.

Quiet (MILCK song)

"Quiet" is a song co-written, co-produced, and performed by MILCK, the stage name of the Los Angeles artist Connie Lim. It received national attention after she organized a capella performances of the song at the 2017 Women's March in Washington D.C., after which she made the sheet music publicly available and organized further activity around the song.
History.
MILCK wrote "Quiet" with her co-writer Adrianne “AG” Gonzalez in 2015. While the song draws on the artist’s adolescent experiences of domestic violence, depression, and anorexia, it was inspired by “a nightmare in which she was being assaulted and a bystander in her dream told her she just had to stay quiet until it was over.” The lyrical structure of the song breaks with the most common pop music song structure, taking the form of verse, pre-chorus, chorus, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, chorus.
MILCK organized 26 singers from various choirs around the U.S. into the #ICANTKEEPQUIET chorus, to perform an a cappella version of her song flash mob style during the 2017 Women’s March in Washington, D.C. One performance with the singers from the GW Sirens &amp; Capital Blend went viral on the internet and MILCK was featured in several publications for having authored the “unofficial anthem” of the Women’s March. Within a week, MILCK and other performers reprised the Women's March version on the television show "Full Frontal with Samantha Bee".
In response to the attention given to "Quiet" as a result of the Women's March, MILCK publicized the song on Twitter using the hashtag #ICANTKEEPQUIET. This was intended to allow people to share their stories and access the sheet music for the a cappella version for free, so that they could create their own #ICANTKEEPQUIET choirs.

Castle Gardens Petroglyph Site

The Castle Gardens Petroglyph Site is a by region of vertical cliff faces in Fremont County, Wyoming, United States, with extensive petroglyph images incised in the rock faces. The glyphs include images of water turtles and circular shields, as well as human and animal figures. The figures with circular shields are particular to the area, and are known as Castle Gardens Shield style images. A consensus of researchers is that the figures were carved by Athabaskans related to the Navajo and Apache, some time between 1000 AD and 1250 AD. The site is being developed by the Bureau of Land Management, and may be visited.
The site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 16, 1969.

Bertucat d'Albret

Bertucat d'Albret was a medieval mercenary leader of a bandit army in the Hundred Years' War. 
Family.
Bertucat d'Albret is an illegitimate son of Bernard Ezy IV sire d'Albret, and half-brother of Arnaud-Amanieu, lord of Montcuq. 
Career.
Bertucat d'Albret fought at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and in 1360 after the Treaty of Brétigny, and without employ, he led a band of brigands, in company of with Bertucat d'Albret in 1361 into the Languedoc, Roussillon, Toulouse and Rouergue districts. 
In 1362, with Bertucat he took Montbrun, plundered Saint-Flour, Cantal then participated with Petit Meschin, at the Battle of Brignais against Jacques de Bourbon Count of La Marche. 
In 1363, when most of the brigands went to go to Italy, he returned to plunder the Languedoc area with Petit Meschin, Louis Rabaud, Arnaud du Solis and Espiote, who together took Brioude on 13 September.
He went to Quercy. In 1357 he appeared in Auvergne and occupied Sermur, which served as a base for his expeditions. 
In June 1359, he joined forces with Robert Knolles in Pont-du-Château. In 1361, he is with Bérard d'Albret, perhaps his cousin, in Bas-Languedoc.
In August 1361, he joined forces with Seguin de Badefol in front of Narbonne and they invade Roussillon, then the Toulouse.
Rouergue pays a ransom for their departure. 
He was defeated at Launac in 1362. He entered Gévaudan with Seguin de Badefol and took Brioude in September. 
In 1365, it makes the castle of Blot and invades the Chalonnais with allies from Gascon. 
He beat Olivier de Mauny with the troops of the Prince of Wales at La Ville-Dieu-du-Temple, in August 1366, then he went to Castile with the Black Prince's army. 
He returned to Quercy in 1369, in Limousin at the beginning of 1371.
He took Figeac in October 1371, but undertook not to attack the region again for 120 000 francs. 
He was imprisoned in 1374 and released at the end of 1376. 
He left Bergerac in 1377. In reward for his participation in the war of Castile, he received in 1379 the land of Arberoue and the castle of Roquefort. 
In 1380, he took Montferrand in March, Chateauneuf-de-Randon, where the Constable Bertrand Du Guesclin died during the siege, and Chaliers in April. 
In 1381, he was in England with Robert Knolles in London alongside Richard II during the revolt of Wat Tyler. 
In thanks, the king gave him the barony of Caumont-sur-Garonne. 
Back in the south of France, the companies of Bertucat d'Albret occupied eight castles in Quercy ordered by two of his lieutenants, Noli Barbe and Bernard Douat. He also had other garrisons in the neighboring provinces, in Gascony, in the Perigord, in the Agenais and Saintonge. 
He was taken prisoner during a skirmish in the summer of 1382. 
He died in September 1383. Raymond or Ramonet de Sort, who called himself his nephew, succeeded him.

Eyre Peninsula Tribune

The Eyre Peninsula Tribune is a weekly newspaper published in Cleve, South Australia, founded in late 1910 and published since March 1911. From 1911 to 1950 it was titled Eyre's Peninsula Tribune, reflecting a time when South Australia's peninsulas were referred to using possessives (e.g. "Yorke's Peninsula Advertiser"). It was later sold to Rural Press, previously owned by Fairfax Media, but now an Australian media company trading as Australian Community Media.
History.
Eyre's Peninsula Tribune was founded in December 1910, with the first issue released on 10 March 1911. The newspaper was founded in Cowell by Charles Wallace, and after his death in 1912 it was managed by George Wallace, and in 1920 it was sold to E.R. Main. In 1941, during wartime rationing, it subsumed the Kimba Dispatch (2 September 1927 - 9 May 1941), which had been founded as a subsidiary by Main. On Thursday 15 May 1941, a subtitle ("with which is incorporated the Kimba "Dispatch."") was added, but in January 1951, the title was simplified to Eyre Peninsula Tribune. 
After Main's death in 1959, the "Tribune" was taken over by the "Port Lincoln Times", who also owned the "Areas Express" (1959-1960), combining the two under the "Tribune" title. In 1963, R.C. Braund of the "Port Lincoln Times" assumed sole control the newspaper, and In 1982 it was taken over by Northern Newspapers Pty Ltd (winning the Ampol Award for the best country newspaper in Australia, with a circulation of under 5,000 the same year). In 1991 it became owned by the New South Wales based Rural Press, formerly a part of Fairfax Media.
Distribution.
Its distribution currently includes Cleve, Arno Bay, Butler, Cowell, Darke Peak, Elbow Hill, Kimba, Koppoio, Lock, Midgee, Port Neil, Rudall, Tumby Bay, Ungarra, Verrar, Wharminda, Yallunda Flat, and it is the oldest continually published newspaper serving the Eyre Peninsula region. Like other Rural Press publications, the newspaper is also available online. 
Digitisation.
Australian National Library carries images and text versions of the newspaper from 1911 to 1950, accessible using Trove, the on-line newspaper retrieval service, under the spelling "Eyre's Peninsula Tribune".

2018–19 VCU Rams men's basketball team

The 2018–19 VCU Rams men's basketball team represented Virginia Commonwealth University during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Rams were led by Mike Rhoades in his second season as head coach at VCU. The Rams played their home games at Stuart C. Siegel Center in Richmond, Virginia as members of the Atlantic 10 Conference.
The Rams surpassing preseason conference polling, won the Atlantic 10 regular season, posting a 25–8 record and earning an at-large bid into the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. There they lost to UCF in the opening round of the tournament.
Background.
The previous season was Mike Rhoades' first season as head coach. The Rams finished the 2017–18 season 18–15, 9–9 in A-10 play to finish tied for fifth place. VCU defeated Dayton in the A-10 Tournament to advance to the quarterfinals, where they lost to Rhode Island. The Rams, for the first time since 2010 failed to earn an at-large bid into the NCAA Tournament or NIT. The Rams had been invited to play in the CBI and CIT tournaments, but declined.

Liz Mputu

Elizabeth Mputu is an artist based in Orlando, Florida. Mputu is a "multiplatform, multimedia artist who engages in work which relates to sex, gender, race and queerness". Mputu works within a space of feminist net art to understand the whiteness and privilege on the internet. Mputu constructs projects using interactive media, video, sculpture and installation.
Background.
Mputu is a first-generation Congolese American, and is currently based out of Orlando, Florida. Mputu first began working creatively with technology during high school by journaling, writing poetry, curating content on Tumblr, editing Myspace photos and making lip sync videos on YouTube. Mputu dropped out of DePaul University and then went to the School of the Art Institute of Chicago for a semester while studying performance art. In 2016, Mputu was working as a freelance Social Media Marketer while also selling artwork.
Selected works.
TeachMeTeaseMe.
"TeachMeTeaseMe" was a Facebook group created by Mputu. It is archived on Tumblr at (https://teachmeteaseme.tumblr.com/). Mputu created this online forum to comfort people on topics related to sex, sexuality, the taboo, body positivity and gender identity. It was moderated with the intent to educate and facilitate dialog around sexuality It was deleted from Facebook after one year.
"Broken Windows".
"Broken Windows" is an interactive web browser project that transports the viewer into new insights via the mystical alliance of digital guides, These guides, or "windows", appear in the form of varying ‘clickable’ objects positioned throughout different sets presented on the screen. The worlds explored include the realities of a police state that has weaponized surveillance, as well as the reactions of a public that rebels against it. "Broken Windows" is a look into how these groups of people are then subject to further violence that can at times be lethal on both sides. For example, the police raids and the civil riots that challenge those tactics.
"LVLZ Healing Center".
"LVLZ Healing Center" is an installation that Mputu created and was displayed at Interstitial in Georgetown/Seattle, WA. This installation was Mputu's first physical art piece, since all of Mputu's previous work was digital. The space was divided into four “portals of healing” which all encompass an “art therapy pod”. Each pod is meant to simulate and represent another space. For example, "Pod 1: Welcome Center", "Pod 2: Level A" is a waiting room, "Pod 3: Level O" is a media and learning center, and "Pod 4: Level Zed" is an apothecary. The whole exhibition uses "video, interactive media, sculpture, and installation… [to] reconstruct our notions of well being".
"Cyber Serenity".
"Cyber Serenity" is a project created by Mputu that targets those who need therapeutic attention. Individuals who have stressors involving self-worth, the internet, and/or artistic dilemmas are the intended audience for this site. The project aims to provide "art therapy, holistic healing, internet related self-care and spiritual consultation".

 is a Shinto shrine located in the city of Takaoka, Toyama Prefecture, Japan. It one of several shrines claiming the title of "ichinomiya" of former Etchū Province. The main "kami" enshrined is Ninigi. The shrine's main festival is held annually on April 23.
History.
The original construction of this shrine is unknown, but it pre-dates the Nara period and was part of a cult entered on the worship of Mount Futagami, a 274-meter mountain in western Toyama Prefecture. The Nara period monk Gyōki is said to have contracted a Buddhist temple associated with the shrine in 717 AD; however, the first mention of the shrine in historical records is in an entry in the 768 AD "Shoku Nihongi", and in the 795 AD "Nihon Kōki". By the 859 AD "Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku", it had been accorded 3rd Court Rank. The shrine is also mentioned in a poem in the "Man'yōshū" by Otomo no Yakamochi dated 748 AD.
The shrine burned down in the Sengoku period and was rebuilt by the Maeda clan during the Edo period. Under the pre-World War II Modern system of ranked Shinto Shrines, the shrine was classified as a National Shrine of the Second Rank ("Kokuhei Chūsha" (国幣中社)), and in 1875 it was relocated to the site of Takaoka Castle in central Takaoka city. It burned down in 1900 and was rebuilt in 1902 in the "Shinmei-zukuri" style of shrine architecture popular at the time.

Lauren Woods

lauren woods is an American artist who works with film, video, performance, and installation art that challenges the systems of oppression and power as they relate to race. She was raised in Dallas, Texas. She is a visiting lecturer at Southern Methodist University.
woods holds undergraduate degrees from the University of North Texas and a 2006 Master of Fine Arts from the San Francisco Art Institute. Her site-specific installation "A Dallas Drinking Fountain Project" gained national attention. Her artwork has been exhibited both across the United States and internationally, including Washington D.C., San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Dallas, and Miami, as well as Puerto Rico, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Mali, and France.
"A Dallas Drinking Fountain Project".
woods launched "A Dallas Drinking Fountain Project" in 2013. The work is installed in a drinking fountain in the Dallas County Records Building. When the button to activate the water fountain is pressed, a clip of Civil Rights era protests is projected onto the fountain. The user is then made aware of the faded remains of the Jim Crow-era sign reading 'Whites Only' that was discovered above the fountain in 2003. woods was visiting Dallas at the time this discovery was made, and began formulating ideas for an installation centering around the fountain soon after. woods first proposed the idea in 2005, envisioning an installation consisting of a functioning water fountain that would play a 45-second long clip of scenes from the struggle for civil rights. Originally, woods envisioned that the water would not start dispensing until the sequence of scenes concluded, but this idea was nixed by commissioners. woods moved back to Dallas from San Francisco- her home of ten years- in 2009 to complete work on "A Dallas Drinking Fountain Project". woods was also seven months pregnant at this time.
The work drew attention to the history of segregation through intervention in a common space, something not possible off-site or in a museum. The work was both celebrated for initiating discussion and critiqued for woods' choice of historical clips.
The project has fueled perspectives on the debate on Confederate statues, suggesting the sites be made into collaborative art-making spaces so as to better confront and address the United States' history of segregation.
The Nasher Sculpture Center Microgrant Winner 2016.
woods was awarded $2000 to help fund her Texas bluebonnet project. This photo-based series will look closely at the correlation between Black bodies to both the natural landscape and built environment. She will be honoring Mothers Against Police Brutality and the lives that have been taken. 
(S)Port of San Francisco.
In her single-channel video piece, "(S)Port of San Francisco", woods creates an "ethno-fictive" study by turning her camera on white responses to an African-American dance group performance on the Embarcadero in San Francisco. The title of woods' piece comes from a song by Flying Lotus featuring rapper Kendrick Lamar.

Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta

Resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) is a procedure that involves placement of an endovascular balloon in the aorta to control bleeding, augment afterload and maintain blood pressure temporarily in traumatic hemorrhagic shock. REBOA is considered a minimally-invasive alternative to thoracotomy with aortic cross-clamping (ACC). 
Methods.
The technique involves inserting a small balloon directly into the patient's aorta and inflating it. The balloon blocks the artery and temporarily stops the blood flow giving doctors time to operate. It maintains blood circulation in the brain and heart. However, the parts of the body below the balloon are cut off from the normal blood flow and this may result in short- or longer-term problems. This technique has been successfully used in operations to control non compressible torso hemorrhages in adults; but this has not been studied for children.

Charles W. Hornor

Charles West Hornor (January 4, 1813 – July 8, 1905) was a lawyer and Reconstruction Era political activist who was secretary of the New Orleans Freedmens Aid Association in New Orleans following the end of the Civil War. He worked with Thomas J. Durant, who was also involved with politics and the causes of freedmen and social reform. "Louisiana History" describes Mr. Hornor as among the leading white radicals, Radical Republicans, in New Orleans at the time. Hornor represented Thomas J. Allen in a case before the U.S. Supreme court. He introduced the first female lawyer to ever appear before the U.S. Supreme Court.He received a letter of support from residents in New York for nomination to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court after the 1865 death of John Catron. The vacant seat was eliminated by congress to prevent Democrat Andrew Johnson, who became president after Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, from filling the seat.
Early years.
Born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Charles West Hornor descended from an established Quaker family which arrived in 1683 as part of William Penn’s fleet of Quaker settlers. Hornor’s grandfather, Benjamin Hornor, was a founding member of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society in 1784. Quaker moral values were deeply instilled in his family.
Charles West Hornor was born in 1813 to Joseph Potts Hornor and Jane West. After attending schools in Philadelphia, he studied at Nazareth Hall in Nazareth, Pennsylvania, a Moravian boarding school. To his disappointment, he was withdrawn from school at age 16, and put to work in a wholesale dry goods house. At that young age, he already had his sights on becoming a lawyer. After several years, he joined a brokerage firm, experienced the volatility of the market, and finally, in 1836, relocated to New Orleans, Louisiana, to clerk in a bank. New Orleans was becoming the nation’s third largest city and the hub of growing Mississippi River trade. After working in the bank, he moved to an insurance company where he was able to study law under the company’s attorney. He was made an attorney in 1842 at the age of 29. 
Hornor married Mary Ellen Talman of New York City, New York, in 1835 and had two children before Mrs. Hornor died of Yellow Fever in 1841. He married Sarah Elizabeth Smith in 1850 with whom he had eight more children.
Career.
Once a member of the Bar, Hornor formed a partnership with fellow Philadelphian Thomas J. Durant. They practiced commercial law together in New Orleans until the close of the Civil War. Immediately after the war, Durant moved to Washington DC while Hornor moved to Philadelphia. Hornor joined Durant in Washington DC in 1872, where he practiced law, including trying cases before the Supreme Court, until an advanced age. 
Charles W Hornor had a lively intellect and after retirement, occupied himself pursuits as varied as studying medicine and translating Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel’s Lectures on Aesthetics from German to English. Alice Lee Moqué was his daughter with his second wife. His grandson was the chemist Walter O. Snelling and his great-grandson was Richard A. Snelling, former governor of Vermont.

Siege of Moscow (1238)

The Siege of Moscow was part of Mongol invasion of Rus.
Prelude.
After the destruction of Ryazan on December 21, 1237, Grand Prince Yuri II sent his sons Vsevolod and Vladimir with most of Vladimir-Suzdal army to stop Mongol invaders at Kolomna. There, the Russian army was defeated, and survivors scattered and fled North, to Vladimir and Moscow.
Siege.
After destruction of Kolomna in January 1238, Prince Vladimir, younger son of Yuri II of Vladimir, fled to Moscow with a small force of survivors. "And the men of Moscow ran away having seen nothing", according to The Chronicle of Novgorod. At the time Moscow was but a fortified village, a trading post "on a crossroads of four rivers". The small, wooden fort was taken after five days of siege.
Aftermath.
Prince Vladimir was captured and executed two weeks later, before the eyes of the defenders of Vladimir.

Aibyn Presidential Regiment

The Aibyn Presidential Regiment of the State Security Service of Kazakhstan (Kazakh: Айбынның Президенттік құрметті қорғау полкі, "Aıbynnyń Prezıdenttik qurmetti qorǵaý polki"; Russian: Президентские полк "Айбын" Службы государственной охраны Республики Казахстан, "Prezidentskiye polk "Aybyn" Sluzhby gosudarstvennoy okhrany Respubliki Kazakhstan") is a ceremonial honor guard of the State Security Service of Kazakhstan. It is comparable to the Kremlin Regiment in Russia and the Azerbaijani National Guard. 
When the Republican Guard was formed in 1992, as decreed by the newly elected President of Kazakhstan, it included a Guard of Honor company called the Ceremonial Battalion. This was later renamed the Presidential Regiment, currently commanded by Captain Khasen Omarkhanov.
Duties and public role.
The unit takes a direct role in the provision of state protocol and ceremonial events. Particularly, it has taken part in the changing of the guard ceremony in the Ak Orda Presidential Palace since 2001 and the Kazakh Presidential Inauguration. In August 1992, the unit marched for the first time in front of President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Almaty and the following April, it mounted the guard of honour for visiting Turkish President Turgut Ozal. In February 1993, personnel of the guard of honor took 24-hour protection under of the national flag and coat of arms in the Palace of the Republic. In 2015, the Soviet Victory Banner was brought to Nur-Sultan (then Astana, the capital of Kazakhstan) to be trooped through Kazakh Eli Square by personnel of the regiment in the Defender of the Fatherland Day parade on 7 May. It holds the ceremony of raising the national flag every year on December 1. 
Foreign visits.
In July 1997, the servicemen of the regiment and the Presidential Band went on a tour to Malaysia at the invitation of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, presenting Kazakh culture and combat art there. In September 2006, the guardsmen were invited to the Russian capital for the celebrations of Moscow City Day, coming back a year later where they took part in the Spasskaya Tower Military Music Festival and Tattoo.
Public figure.
The official regimental uniform is a white and aqua tunic for officers and a blue tunic for soldiers. Being at least is one of the requirements to be in the regiment, the other is good health. The honorific of "Aibyn" was added in 2014.

Obama–Trump voters

In the United States, Obama-Trump voters, sometimes referred to as Trump Democrats or Obama Republicans, are people who voted for Democratic Party nominee Barack Obama in the 2008 or 2012 presidential elections (or both), but later voted for Republican Party nominee Donald Trump in 2016 and 2020. Data shows that in 2016, these voters comprised roughly 13% of Trump voters. In 2012, this segment of voters made up 9% of total Obama voters. Seven percent of 2012 Obama voters did not vote at all in 2016, and 3% voted for a third party candidate. While some analysts consider Obama-Trump voters to have been decisive in Trump's 2016 victory, others have disputed this conclusion.
According to research done by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, compared to other voters, Obama-Trump voters have liberal economic views and conservative social views.
Though these voters supported Trump in the 2016 and 2020 elections, they are less supportive of Republicans as a whole, and show a desire to change the "status quo".
Studies.
Various studies estimate the percentage of 2016 Trump voters, who had previously voted for Obama, at between 11 and 15 percent. The Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) found that 11% of 2016 Trump voters had voted for Obama in 2012, with the American National Election Study putting the number at 13%, and the University of Virginia Center for Politics estimating 15%. Expressed in total number of voters, these percentages indicate that between 7 and 9 million 2016 Trump voters voted for Obama in 2012. According to a May 2017 McClatchy news report, an analysis by Democratic political firm Global Strategy Group estimated that Obama-Trump voters accounted for more than two-thirds of Obama voters who did not vote for Hillary Clinton.
Significance.
Some analysts have argued that Obama-Trump voters had a disproportionately large impact on the 2016 election because they were concentrated in key swing states in the Midwest while others have said they were actually "Obama Republicans" rather than Democrats to begin with. 
Some have disputed both the quantity and the significance of Obama-Trump voters in deciding the outcome of the 2016 election. Dana Milbank argued in an August 2017 "Washington Post" column that the number of such voters was initially overstated and that most of them were Republicans who only defected from their party to vote for Obama, not Democrats who defected to support Trump. Nate Cohn countered Milbank's assessment by arguing that Milbank's focus on national data obscured the magnitude of Democratic defection in 2016 to support Trump. Cohn noted that when looking specifically at white Obama voters with no higher education than a high school diploma, Clinton won only 74% (based on data from the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group) or 78% (based on the Cooperative Congressional Election Study).
In a 2021 interview about their book "Trump's Democrats", Stephanie Muravchik and Jon A. Shields noted that many Obama-Trump voters likewise voted for Trump in the 2020 election, in some counties in even larger numbers than in 2016. Muravchik and Shields assessed that these "flipped" Democrats would continue to be a key factor in future elections.
Voters' views.
Shortly before the 2016 election, "The New York Times" reported that Obama voters who planned to vote for Trump felt he embodied the "change" they had hoped for when they voted for Obama. Multiple focus groups of Obama-Trump voters convened by the Roosevelt Institute and Democracy Corps in early 2017 showed that in general these voters wanted to change the "status quo" and had skeptical views of Congressional Republicans and their proposals. The same focus groups also indicated that these voters hoped President Trump would help reduce health care costs for working-class Americans, and that they were anxious about some immigrant groups.
A multi-year survey completed by the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group found that Obama-Trump voters generally had liberal views on economic issues, but conservative views on social issues. In a 2017 editorial for New York Magazine, Eric Levitz noted that data from the CCES indicates 75% of Obama-Trump voters supported repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act.
According to an article in Politico, a September 2017 Democracy Fund Voter Study Group poll found that 70% of Obama-Trump voters approved of the job Trump was doing as president. This figure was significantly lower than the 88% approval rating among all Trump voters. Similarly, the percent of voters who disapproved of Trump's performance in this poll was much higher among Obama-Trump voters (22%) than among Trump voters as a whole (9%).
In the 2020 U.S. presidential election (in a record turnout for both the Republican and Democratic Party candidates) while Trump lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump still received millions more votes than he had received in 2016, including an overall increase in votes from people of color. Likewise Biden received more votes than did Hillary Clinton in 2016.
In a 2021 interview about their book "Trump's Democrats", Stephanie Muravchik and Jon A. Shields assert that (in light of the even higher turnout for Trump in 2020 in many counties that had previously flipped from Obama to Trump) the views, geographical location, and votes, of Obama-Trump voters, will continue to be important in U.S. elections.

He received in 1951 his bachelor's degree and in 1953 his Ph.D. from University College London (UCL) under Florence Nightingale David and Norman Lloyd Johnson with thesis "Some problems connected with distribution problems." Mallows joined the UCL faculty and taught there from 1955 to 1959 with a sabbatical year at Princeton University in the academic year 1957–1958. He worked for Bell Labs in Murray Hill, New Jersey from 1960 to 1995 and then for AT&amp;T Labs in Florham Park, New Jersey from 1995 to 2000, when he retired.

As described in a review in a film magazine, James Livingstone (Stone), reaching the stage where he regards his wife Grace (Vidor) as a valet as she “lays out” her husband’s clothes, is rudely awakened when she takes his advice and "dolls up.” Rex Phillips (Cody), debonair friend of James, also takes notice of the change with some flattery. As a result, the two become infatuated. James abruptly learns of the secret friendship when his circumstances cause him to substitute for Phillips in a tryst with Grace. He consents to her obtaining a divorce. James comes to realize he is still in love and to appreciates his former wife’s yearning for verbal flattery.

Sack of Chernigov

The Sack of Chernigov was part of the Mongol invasion of Rus.'
Prelude.
The Mongol invasion of Rus' can be divided into two phases. In the winter of 1237-38, they conquered the northern Rus' territories (the principalities of Ryazan and Vladimir-Suzdal) with the exception of the Novgorod Republic, but in the spring of 1238 they retreated back to the Wild Fields. The second campaign, aimed at the southern Rus' territories (the principalities of Chernigov and Kiev) came in 1239.
Battle.
In the autumn of 1239, the Tatar horde captured Hlukhiv, Kursk, Rylsk, and Putivl, and advanced towards Chernigov. When Prince Mstislav heard that the Tatars were attacking the town, he came with his troops to confront them. The nomads used catapults that hurled stones the distance of a bowshot and a half. Mstislav barely escaped, but many of his men were killed.
Aftermath.
After Chernigov fell on October 18, the Tatars pillaged the towns in the surrounding countryside. Even the capital city of Kiev fell in autumn of 1240.

The publication's tag line is "Truth, Beauty, Science."
The magazine is published under the auspices of the Knight Science Journalism Fellowships program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"Undark" publishes a mix of long-form journalism, shorter features, essays, op-eds, questions and answers, and book excerpts and reviews. All content is freely available to read, and most is available for republishing by other publications and websites. Many large national and international publications, including "Scientific American", "The Atlantic", "Smithsonian", NPR, and "Outside" have republishing relationships with "Undark".
"Undark" was jointly founded in 2016 by Pulitzer Prize-winning science author Deborah Blum and former "New York Times" journalist Tom Zeller Jr., who serves as editor-in-chief of the magazine.
Awards.
On February 19, 2019, "Undark" was awarded a George Polk Award for Environmental Reporting. The award honored photojournalist Larry C. Price and contributing reporters for the magazine's multinational, multipart exposé on global air pollution, called "Breathtaking". The series also won the 2019 Al Neuharth Innovation in Investigative Journalism Award from the Online News Association.
The magazine's work has been anthologized in "The Best American Science &amp; Nature Writing" book series.
In 2017, "Undark" was a finalist for an Online Journalism Award in the Feature category for its series "Wear &amp; Tear", which explored the global impacts of the leather tanning and textile industries. In 2018, three "Undark" contributors were named as finalists in the National Association of Science Writers' Science and Society Awards.

The Du Chef River is a tributary of the Ashuapmushuan River, flowing into the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in Quebec, in Canada. The course of the river crosses the Regional County Municipality (RCM) of:
The "Du Chef River" is the main tributary of the Ashuapmushuan River. It runs in the cantons of Bonne, Gauvin, Duberger, Thibaudeau, Saracen, Denys, Piat, Corbeil, Guyart, Aiguillon, Théberge and Desgly. The lower part of the river course is the separation between the RCM Le Domaine-du-Roy and the MRC Maria-Chapdelaine. While the intermediate and upper part of the river passes in the RCM of Le Domaine-du-Roy along more or less the limit of the two MRC. Forestry is the main economic activity of this valley; recreational tourism activities, second.
Forest Road R0203 (North-South direction) serves the valley of Hilarion River, "Du Chef River" and Nestaocano River; this
road starting south at the junction of route 167 which links Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec.
The surface of "Du Chef River" is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
The origin of this hydronym remains unknown. This name, which is in use at least in the nineteenth century, is indicated in
particular on a map of the surveyor Henry O'Sullivan, drawn as a result of explorations carried out between 1897 and 1899. From the end of the seventeenth century, this Stream was used as one of the ordinary routes of travel between lakes Saint-Jean and Mistassini. Botanist André Michaux borrowed it in 1792.
This watercourse is designated "Shetshishkuesheu" by the Innu commconverty, meaning "river where there is shade".
The toponym "Rivière du Chef" was officialized on December 5, 1968, at the Commission de toponymie du Québec, when it was created.

NGC 4580 is an unbarred spiral galaxy located about 70 million light-years away in the constellation Virgo. NGC 4580 is also classified as a LINER galaxy. It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on February 2, 1786 and is a member of the Virgo Cluster.
Physical characteristics.
NGC 4580 consists of a ringed structure. The inner pseudoring of the galaxy is very well-defined and is made of two tightly wound spiral arms. Three very diffuse spiral arms which are partly defined by dust, split off from the inner pseudoring.
Truncated Disk.
NGC 4580 has a severely truncated star-forming disk. This may be due to ram-pressure stripping caused by the infall of the Messier 49 subcluster into the Virgo Cluster. Due to the truncation of the star forming disk, NGC 4580 is classified as an Anemic galaxy.

Afonso Furtado de Mendonça

D. Afonso Furtado de Mendonça (Montemor-o-Novo, 1561 - Lisbon, 2 June 1630) was a Portuguese prelate, who was for five years Bishop of Guarda, two years Bishop of Coimbra, seven years Archbishop of Braga, and four years of Lisbon, in whose cathedral, in the main chapel, he was buried.
Biography.
D. Afonso was the son of Jorge Furtado de Mendonça, Commander of the Entries, of Patterns and of the Dam in the Order of Santiago, and of his wife D. Mécia Henriques.
He made his first studies in Lisbon and confirmed them in Coimbra, according to the Bibliotheca Lusitana, Tomo I, page 36. Graduated from the University of Coimbra with his Doctorate in the Faculty of Canons, he was admitted to the College of Saint Peter on 10 May 1592, where he became the rector of the same university in 1597. Philip II of Portugal nominated him, in January 1605, Councilor of State in the Council of Portugal. In 1608 he was elected President of the Bureau of Conscience and Orders.
He was appointed Bishop of Guarda in August 1609, taking office on 13 February 1610, where he "took away the pernicious roots of many abuses and introduced the sacred ordinances of the Council of Trent". Then elevated to the See of Coimbra by Pope Paul V's bull, passed on 5 December 1615.
Varying the Priory Mithra of Braga by the death of D. Frei Aleixo de Meneses, in 1618, D. Afonso was named successor as Archbishop of Braga.
He was appointed Archbishop of Lisbon in January 1626, confirmed by Pope Urban VIII on December 3 of that same year, being until his death on 2 June 1630. He was also created one of the Governors of the Kingdom, along with Diogo de Castro, Count de Basto, and Diogo da Silva, Count of Portalegre, a post he held from 13 September 1623 until shortly before his death.

Marie C. Couvent Elementary School

Marie C. Couvent Elementary was a historic elementary school in New Orleans, Louisiana named for Marie Couvent, an African American former slave who married successful African American businessman Bernard Couvent and deeded property for the Institute Catholique.
The school was built in 1940 in Faubourg Marigny and originally named Marigny Elementary School. It was renamed for Marie Couvent and renamed again in 1997 to A. P. Tureaud Elementary School because the Couvents had slaves.
History.
In 1989 Sun Ra performed in front of the school. 
In the 1990s a campaign was launched to rename city public schools that venerated slaveholders. Since Couvent and her husband owned slaves, and the school changed its name in 1997 to A. P. Tureaud Elementary School for A.P. Tureaud. Manumission may have been illegal during the era they lived so their options to free people may have been limited.

Jaguar XF (X260)

The Jaguar XF (X260) is an executive car/mid-size luxury car manufactured and marketed by the Jaguar Cars brand of Jaguar Land Rover in sedan/saloon and station wagon/estate body styles. Following the first generation steel-bodied X250 XF introduced in 2007, the second-generation XF sedan/saloon debuted at the 2015 New York International Auto Show, noted for its aluminium bodywork.
Overview.
The XF is an evolution of the original J-Blade design pioneered in the X250 XF, with a largely similar silhouette. Effort was made to build a uniform design language across Jaguar's saloon range.
The X260 XF uses 83 percent all-new parts compared with the previous model. The car is shorter than the predecessor. Bodywork uses aluminium as the primary component of the body structure and chassis; the XF's bodyside panel is a single aluminium pressing.
The chassis featured a fully independent suspension, including multiple "modes" in the S model providing either maximum comfort, maximum performance, or a setting in between. The standard model in the USA featured a P250 247 HP Ingenium engine. Optional power included the P300 296 HP turbo 4 and the P380 380 HP supercharged V6 for the performance-oriented S model. Diesel engines, while available in other markets, were not available to customers in North America. 
The Sportbrake (estate) bodystyle was unveiled in 2012. The Sportbrake was introduced for sale in the USA in 2018 where it was positioned as a competitor for other high performance "station wagons." It was initially available only in S trim for North America, with the high performance F-Type 3.0L supercharged 380 HP engine and all wheel drive. The XF S in sportbrake trim was able to accelerate from 0-60 in 5.0 seconds. 
Chinese and Indian models.
A long-wheelbase version debuted at the 2016 Beijing Motor Show, with added to the wheelbase giving rear passengers more legroom and more kneeroom. As the car is designed for chauffeur driven drivers in mind, therefore standard equipment includes folding tables, massaging seats, electric window blinds and eight-inch screens integrated in the back of the front-seat headrests.
It is the first aluminium-bodied car built in China with the debut of some new features, with Clear Exit Detection warning passengers of opening the doors into traffic approaching from behind. The XFL comes with a new cabin air ionisation technology to make the air inside the car more comfortable. For the driver, the InControl Touch Pro infotainment system with its 10.2-inch touchscreen works alongside a configurable 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster which works together with a 17-speaker, 825-watt Meridian Surround Sound System. Rear passengers have access to a wide array of buttons as well as to 2 HDMI ports, 2 USB 3.0 ports, and a 12V power socket.
The 2.0-litre I4 engine is offered in power output configurations and a 3.0-litre supercharged V6 engine is also offered as the ultimate engine option, with all versions coming with an automatic transmission. The long wheelbase models come with four-wheel-drive only. Due to the long wheelbase and added features, the XFL weighs more than the standard XF.
On 22 September 2016, the Jaguar XF was launched in India for Rs. 4,750,000 onwards. The engines offered for the Indian market include the 2.0-litre Ingenium petrol and diesel I4 engines. The XF is assembled in India from complete knock-down kits alongside the XE and F-Pace.
Engine specifications.
Manual transmission was introduced for the first time in the second generation of Jaguar XF. Previously there was only automatic transmission available.

T Cross Ranch is a dude ranch in Fremont County, Wyoming. The ranch is located at altitude in Shoshone National Forest, from Dubois and from the Washakie Wilderness. Apart from a cabin built by the site's original homesteader, the contributing buildings of the ranch date between 1916 and 1946. The ranch was established in 1918 by German immigrant Henry Seipt when he established his homestead and called it The Hermitage. Seipt and his family ran the ranch as a hunting and fishing camp until 1929, when it was sold to Robert and Helen Cox. The Coxes renamed it the T Cross Ranch and made it into a dude ranch. The new name was derived from the Tau Chapter of Saint Anthony's Society, to which Robert Cox had belonged at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and from the cross of St. Anthony. A total of 16 log buildings comprise the historic section of the ranch. The district also includes irrigation ditches dug during the 1920s and 1930s.
The T Cross Ranch was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.

The Vandals had been a last place team in the Big Sky Conference for five straight seasons in the late 1970s, but rose to second in 1980 and then won consecutive conference titles (regular season and tournament) in 1981 and 1982. The latter finished the regular season at with a #6 ranking in both and advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in the NCAA tournament. The 1983 team slipped back slightly, but was in the regular season and was invited to the NIT, a first for the Big Sky.

Emmy Murphy

Emmy Murphy (4 September 1986) is an American mathematician and an associate professor at Northwestern University who works in the area of symplectic topology, contact geometry and geometric topology. 
Education.
Murphy graduated from the University of Nevada, Reno in 2007, the first in her family to earn a college degree.
She completed her doctorate at Stanford University in 2012; her dissertation, "Loose Legendrian Embeddings in High Dimensional Contact Manifolds", was supervised by Yakov Eliashberg.
Career.
She was a C. L. E. Moore instructor and assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving in 2016 to Northwestern University, where she is an associate professor of mathematics.
Murphy is recognized for her contribution to symplectic and contact geometry. She won the Breakthrough Prize for "the introduction of notions of loose Legendrian submanifolds", and "overtwisted contact structures in higher dimensions", which is joint work with Matthew Strom Borman and Yakov Eliashberg.
Murphy was invited to the International Congress of Mathematicians in 2018 and she gave a talk related to some results on h-principle phenomena. Apart from using h-principle to study the flexibility of local geometric models, Murphy's work uses cut-and-paste/surgery techniques from smooth topology. She also works on exploring the interaction of symplectic/contact topology with geometric invariants, such as those coming from pseudo-holomorphic curves or constructible sheaves.
Murphy received the grants from National Science Foundation for the period 2019-2022 on the topic "Flexible Stein Manifolds and Fukaya Categories".

Ora Brown Stokes Perry (1882–1957) was an American educator, probation officer, temperance worker, and clubwoman based in Richmond, Virginia.
Early life.
Ora E. Brown was born in Chesterfield County, Virginia, the daughter of Rev. James E. Brown and Olivia Knight Quarles Brown. She trained as a teacher at Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, graduating in 1900. She also studied at Hartshorn Memorial College and the University of Chicago. In 1917, she was refused admission to the newly organized Richmond School of Social Economy because of her race.
Career.
Ora Brown Stokes taught school in Milford, Virginia for two years as a young woman, before marrying and taking up the work of a pastor's wife. In 1911, she addressed the Hampton Negro Conference on the topic "The Negro Woman's Religious Activity". "We need women who will demand a clean pulpit as well as a clean pew," she declared, "women who will demand a high and equal standard for men as well as for women." That same year, Stokes co-founded the Richmond Neighborhood Association, holding the first meeting in her own home. Seeing a need for vocational training and housing for African-American women in Richmond, Ora Brown Stokes and Orie Latham Hatcher (a white woman) co-founded the Home for Working Girls. From 1918, she was appointed by Justice John Crutchfield as a probation officer for black women and girls in the juvenile courts of Richmond.
During World War I, she chaired the Colored Women's Section, National Defense of Virginia, and organized the National Protective League for Negro Girls.
After suffrage, Stokes was head of Virginia's Negro Women's League of Voters, formed when the League of Women Voters in Virginia declined to include black women. In 1921 she was named a non-resident lecturer and member of the faculty at her alma mater, the Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute, and she gave a speech to the school's alumni association. In 1924, she was Virginia chair of the Colored Women's Department of the Republican National Committee, but later described the experience as frustrating. In 1927, Stokes was elected president of the Southeastern Association of Colored Women's Clubs. In 1928, when she addressed the national meeting of the League of Women Voters, she was listed as president of the National Independent Order of Good Shepherds. In 1940, she was at the organizational meeting of the National Association of Ministers' Wives, organized by Elizabeth Coles Bouey. She was an advisor to the National Youth Administration under Mary McLeod Bethune, was vice-president of the Negro Organization Society of Virginia, was vice-president of the National Race Congress, and was national field secretary for the Women's Christian Temperance Union.
Personal life.
Ora Brown married twice. Her first husband was William Herbert Stokes, a minister at Richmond's Ebenezer Baptist Church; they married in 1902. She was widowed in 1936. In 1948 she was married again, to physician and hospital administrator J. Edward Perry, the widower of Fredericka Douglass Sprague Perry. She died in 1957, aged 75 years.

12th Flying Training Wing

The 12th Flying Training Wing is a United States Air Force unit assigned to Air Education and Training Command's Nineteenth Air Force. It is headquartered at Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. The wing is the parent organization for the 479th Flying Training Group, located at NAS Pensacola, Florida and the 306th Flying Training Group, at The United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. The 12th Wing is the only unit in the Air Force conducting both pilot instructor training and combat systems officer training.
The wing fought in combat as the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing during the Vietnam War and was the host unit at two major air bases in South Vietnam. Its McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II aircraft flew thousands of combat missions between 1965 and 1971 before being withdrawn as part of the U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam and Southeast Asia.
The commander of the 12th Flying Training Wing is Col Mark S. Robinson. The Command Chief Master Sergeant is Chief Master Sergeant Tony Goldstrom.
Units.
The wing consists of three flying groups and a maintenance directorate spanning more than 1,600 miles from JBSA-Randolph, Texas to Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, to Pueblo Memorial Airport and the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado.
The 12th Operations Group controls all Instructor Pilot Training and airfield operations at Randolph AFB and Randolph AFB Auxiliary Field/Seguin Field.
The 479th Flying Training Group is a geographically separated unit located at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida and conducts Undergraduate Combat Systems Officer Training.
The 306th Flying Training Group is a geographically separated unit located at the United States Air Force Academy, Colorado. The 306 FTG conducts powered flight training, soaring, and parachute training for Air Force Academy cadets.
History.
Strategic Fighter.
The wing was first organized at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia on 1 November 1950 as the 12th Fighter-Escort Wing, but moved a month later to Bergstrom Air Force Base, Texas.
Combat in Vietnam.
The wing was reactivated as the 12th Tactical Fighter Wing and organized in April 1962 at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida.
Flying Training.
Background.
The wing was redesignated the 12th Flying Training Wing and activated on 1 May 1972, when the personnel, mission and equipment of the 3510th Flying Training Wing were assumed by the wing, while the 3510th was simultaneously inactivated
1990s.
In 1992, due to the impending closure of Mather Air Force Base, California, the 12 FTW also assumed responsibility for Undergraduate Navigator Training (UNT) and Interservice Undergraduate Navigator Training (IUNT) from the 323d Flying Training Wing (323 FTW) at Mather when that organization inactivated, with most T-43A aircraft and some of the 323 FTW squadrons reforming at Randolph AFB under the 12 FTW. In 2009, with the transition of UNT to undergraduate Combat Systems Officer training (UCSOT) and pursuant to earlier Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) directives, the 12 FTW established a new organization, the 479th Flying Training Group (479 FTG), with two new flying training squadrons and an operations support squadron, as a GSU at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Although NAS Pensacola is the principal base for student Naval Flight Officer (SNFO) training for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps, the 479 FTG operates independently of this program with its own USAF T-6 Texan II and T-1 Jayhawk aircraft. Upon establishment of the 479 FTG at NAS Pensacola, the remaining "legacy" navigator training squadrons that had relocated from the former Mather AFB to Randolph AFB in 1992 were inactivated.
The 2010s.
In the second decade of the 21st century, the wing's mission is to provide instructor pilot training in the Raytheon-Beech T-6A Texan II, the Northrop T-38 Talon and the Beech T-1A Jayhawk jet trainers. Previously, the wing also conducted Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals (IFF) in the Northrop AT-38 Talon, a role now performed with T-38s.
Until late 2010, the wing also conducted Joint Specialized Undergraduate Navigator Training (JSUNT) and electronic warfare officer (EWO) training in the T-1A Jayhawk and Boeing T-43A medium-range turbofan jet at Randolph AFB. With the retirement of the T-43 in September 2010, this training merged with extant USAF weapons systems officer (WSO) training that had been conducted jointly with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida since 1990. The navigator, EWO and WSO training tracks were then merged and all three specialties (which wear the same type of uniform insignia wings upon completion of flight training) became known as Combat Systems Officer (CSO). This updated CSO training is now conducted by the 479th Flying Training Group as a Geographically Separated Unit (GSU) of the 12 FTW at NAS Pensacola utilizing T-6 Texan II and T-1A Jayhawk aircraft.
The wing is responsible for numerous aviation training programs. These programs include Pilot Instructor Training, Combat Systems Officer Training, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Pilot Indoctrination, Basic Sensor Operator Qualification, Airmanship programs for U.S. Air Force Academy cadets, and Introductory Flight Screening.

Aleksi Heponiemi

Aleksi Heponiemi (born 9 January 1999) is a Finnish professional ice hockey forward currently playing as a prospect to the Florida Panthers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Heponiemi was selected in the second round (40th overall) in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Panthers.
Playing career.
After being selected 10th overall by the Swift Current Broncos in the 2016 CHL Import Draft, Heponiemi began his junior career for the Broncos in the 2016–17 WHL season. Early in the season, Heponiemi began to rise in draft rankings and became an offensive leader for the Broncos. He adjusted quickly to the playing style of the WHL and was named WHL Rookie of the Year, producing the most points and assists out of any rookie in the season with 86.
Despite his statistics, Heponiemi's final scout ranking for the 2017 NHL Entry Draft was 26 by the NHL Central Scouting. Scouts mainly praised Heponiemi for his efficient point producing, his creativeness, and his speed. Heponiemi was selected in the second round, 40th overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Florida Panthers. Due to his point-producing skill in his rookie season in the WHL, some think Heponiemi was a steal because of how late he was selected in the second round by the Panthers.
Heponiemi had a career year during the 2017–18 season, where he accumulated 118 points in 57 regular season games. For his efforts, at the conclusion of the regular season he was named the Pattison Agriculture King of the Road, the Second Star of the season, and the Eastern Conference Most Sportsmanlike Player.
Following the conclusion of the season, Heponiemi turned professional and signed with Oulun Kärpät of the Liiga. In the 2018–19 season, Heponiemi as a rookie appeared in 50 games for Kärpät producing 16 goals and 46 points. He led all Liiga rookies in points, while finishing second on Kärpät in points and tying for first on the club in assists. In the playoffs, Heponiemi tallied three goals in 17 games.
On 16 May 2019, Heponiemi was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the Florida Panthers.
With the 2020–21 North American season delayed until November due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Heponiemi was loaned by the Panthers to Swedish second-tier club, Modo Hockey of the Allsvenskan, on 9 August 2020. Heponiemi made his NHL debut on 30 January 2021, scoring an overtime goal in the Panthers' 3–2 win over the Detroit Red Wings. He became the fourth player in NHL history to score an overtime goal in his NHL debut.
International play.
Heponiemi played in the 2016 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, a tournament not regulated by the International Ice Hockey Federation but still considered an important tournament for under-18 players. He played 4 games for Finland in the tournament, recording 5 assists as Finland finished in 3rd place. Heponiemi also participated and was named to Team Finland in the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships where Finland finished 6th and Heponiemi scored 2 goals in 5 games with the team.
Personal life.
Heponiemi began playing hockey when he was four years old, and has two older brothers, Valtteri and Ville. Aleksi and his brother Ville both played for the Ilves youth junior team and in the 2015–16 season both brothers won the championship together. His brother, Valtteri current plays for the Pirkkala Penguins, a third division team in Pirkkala, Finland along with Ville who also plays for the Penguins, along with Valtteri.

The Diocese of Thiges () was a Roman Catholic diocese in ancient Byzacena.
History.
In late antiquity the diocese was centered on a civitas of the Roman Province of Byzacena, Africa Province. That ancient civitas is today identifiable with Bordj-Gourbata in today's Tunisia.
The diocese lasted until the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, when it ceased to function effectively. However, the diocese was reborn in name at least in the early 20th century as a titular see. Today Tiges survives as a titular bishop's seat.

Australian Transport Officers' Federation

The Australian Transport Officers' Federation (ATOF) was an Australian trade union representing salaried officers in the transport sector, particularly in the rail and airline industries. It existed from 1924 until 1991, and was previously known as the Federation of Salaried Officers of Railways Commissioners (1924–1947) and the Australasian Transport Officers Federation (1947–1978). The union had a policy of supporting conciliation and arbitration and against strike action until 1970.
History.
The Federation was formed in 1924 through the merger of the Railway and Tramway Officers' Association, based in NSW, and the Victorian Railways Administrative Officers' and Clerks' Association. The NSW body had been founded in 1913, while Victorian association had been registered in February 1921 following a High Court decision that gave workers in "state instrumentalities" access to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. The association sought to represent the interests of railway officers as distinct from railway workers more broadly. The association sought to form a national union and formed agreements with similar unions in other states, which applied for federal registration as the Federation of Salaried Officers of Railways Commissioners. It met fierce opposition from the union movement, resulting in the case lingering before the industrial registrar for three years. The union argued that a separate union was necessary because officers in responsible positions having to be part of a general organisation would "result in a complete subversion of discipline" and the Australian Railways Union was "inclined to support affiliations with which responsible officers should not be associated".
The union was eventually registered federally in September 1924 and was headquartered in Sydney. O. A. Meyer, the president of the NSW Railway and Tramway Officers' Association, became the union's president, while P. Hunt was general secretary. In November 1925, when it held its first triennial conference, it had 5300 members in New South Wales, 1000 in South Australia and 850 in Victoria, and were attempting to convince state organisations in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia to join. The union spoke openly about what they viewed as their need to remain non-political and non-partisan because of their "duty to comply with the directions and tender loyal service to whatever Government might be in power". The union initially barred women from joining, objecting to women being appointed to positions that had been previously occupied by men. In 1928 announced its opposition to the employment of women for other than mechanical office work, and in 1931 it advocated female typists being fired before male clerks faced further rationing. In the mid-1930s, the union began campaigning for an that appointments and promotions should be determined by an appointments board with an independent chairman, in response to widespread discontent with the process then in use. The union adamantly opposed strike action in the 1946 Victorian railway strike, and claimed to have recruited new members from the Australian Railways Union in the aftermath.
In 1947, the union renamed itself the Australasian Transport Officers' Federation and sought to expand its coverage to include air, road and railway employees, although membership at first remained constitutionally limited to "transport officers of the Crown. In August 1947, the union established a Tasmanian branch for the first time. The union initially remained limited to representing railway officers; however, in 1948 it began breaking into the airline industry, establishing a Trans Australia Airlines special branch to deal with the new members. The broadening of the union's coverage met with opposition from the Federated Clerks' Union. It would also later extend to include Qantas employees. In 1950, the union wavered on its opposition to strike action, with the SA branch resolving to consider it if an appeals board were not instituted, and in Victoria in protest at non-striking members being stood down without pay during other unions' strike action; however, no action was taken.
In 1970, the union finally broke with its policy against strike action, with both Victorian and NSW railway members taking industrial action in response to disputes in their states, repeated again several times during the 1970s and 1980s, although the union was still seen as more conservative than the ARU. In 1979, the union placed a "black ban" on independent NSW state MP John Hatton after he called for an inquiry into alleged corruption in the transport department, resulting in a parliamentary resolution rebuking the union and an end to the ban. In 1990, following the 1989 Australian pilots' dispute, four airlines sought orders that their pilots be covered by the Transport Officers Federation, rather than the Australian Federation of Air Pilots, the union which had gone on strike the previous year.
In April 1991, the Transport Officers' Federation voted to merge with the Municipal Officers Association of Australia and the Technical Service Guild of Australia to form the Australian Municipal Transport Energy Water Ports Community &amp; Information Services Union. The amalgamated union, which took effect from 1 July 1991, was often known as the Australian Services Union, and later formed the modern Australian Services Union after a series of mergers with other unions.

Paul Trévigne

Paul Trévigne (1825 – September 1, 1908) was an American newspaperman and civil rights activist in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was editor of two black-owned newspapers, "L'Union" from 1862 until it closed in 1864, and then the "New Orleans Tribune" (1864-1870), the first black daily newspaper in the country.
He continued to work on civil rights issues, seeking equal rights for those who had been free people of color before the war, as well as the many freedmen emancipated by the war. He opposed efforts by white Democrats to impose segregation.
Early life and education.
Paul Trévigne was born in 1825, biracial son of a veteran of the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. Free men of color had served in the militia under French rule, and fought with the Americans during the United States' War of 1812 against the British. Tensions had arisen relatively soon after the US made the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Trévigne grew up in the community of free people of color, who had had a range of liberties under French colonial rule. After acquiring this territory, the Americans had begun to impose segregation common to their slave societies.
There were no public schools in the city when he was young. Some free children of color were educated or tutored privately if their families could afford it. Trévigne became educated. Early in his career he taught at the Catholic Indigent Orphan School, established by the Archdiocese of New Orleans, which provided education to African-American orphans.
Newspaper career.
Dr. Louis Charles Roudanez and his older brother Jean Baptiste Roudanez, also free men of color, founded "L'Union" in 1862 after the Union defeated the Confederate troops and captured New Orleans in April of that year.
They hired Trévigne as editor of "L'Union", which strongly promoted the Unionist Republican cause in Louisiana. It also promoted the cause of emancipation and the franchise for all enslaved African Americans in the state, where blacks made up half the population, and across the South. Trévigne emphasized the potential political power of blacks in the state and region. He and Dr. Roudanez encountered much opposition among white Democrats in the city.
After acquiring a printing press from New York in 1864, Dr. Roudanez founded "La Tribune de la Nouvelle-Orleans" (New Orleans Tribune) that same year. It also attracted readers from the Union Army. Trévigne again served as his editor. They stressed civil rights for all African Americans, not the relatively few who had been free people of color before the war. The paper closed in 1869 after losing national Republican Party funding because of criticism by some northern white opponents.
The "New Orleans Tribune", published in French and English, was the first daily black newspaper in the United States. The two newspapers had wide circulation among black readers in the city and across the South. Readers were mostly free people of color, as enslaved African Americans were generally prohibited from being educated.
Also working at the newspapers was Jean-Charles Houzeau, a Francophone astronomer, journalist, and abolitionist from Belgium. He had immigrated to the United States after political troubles in what was then part of the Dutch Republic, living in Texas for a while before settling in New Orleans.
During the latter part of Reconstruction, Trévigne wrote "Centennial History of the Louisiana Negro", which was published in the "Louisianian" in 1875-1876 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the American Revolution. One of the first state histories about blacks to be published in the United States, it "highlighted the scientific, literary, and artistic contributions of African Americans in Louisiana".
He continued to oppose segregation, working for civil rights after the US Supreme Court decision in "Plessy v. Ferguson" (1896), which ruled that separate but equal accommodations were constitutional. The case had challenged state segregation restrictions on interstate railroads, as the Constitution provided for equal rights to all citizens.
Personal life.
Trévigne's aunt was Mother Henriette DeLille, the pioneering Black Catholic in New Orleans who founded the Sisters of the Holy Family.

Antorcha (award)

The Antorcha ("") was an award given to the artists who participate in the Viña del Mar International Song Festival according to audience reaction. It was created in 1983 in honor of the paper torches that people lit in the stands of Quinta Vergara.
In January 2015, this award was eliminated in favor of the "Gaviota". The reason is due to the devaluation that the award had suffered in previous years, including the "excessive" intervention of the presenters, who had to interrupt the presentation on four occasions.
Trophy.
The trophy has the shape of a torch, supported by three cylindrical bars that suspend it. It is inserted in a wooden base. Originally, one torch was plated in silver, but later, and to regulate the delivery of the "Gaviotas de Oro", another torch was created, plated in gold. This shaped their names: The "Antorcha de Plata" and the "Antorcha de Oro". The trophy is made in Chile, by a local company called "Broncerías Chile".
Antorcha de Plata.
The Antorcha de Plata ("") was usually the first prize given to an artist at the request of the public during his presentation.
This award was created in 1983, with the objective of regulating the delivery of "Gaviotas de Plata" to the artist by popular demand and reserve it exclusively for the winners of the "International" and "Folk Competitions". It was definitively replaced by the "Gaviota de Plata" in the LVI Viña Festival.
Antorcha de Oro.
The Antorcha de Oro ("") was usually the top prize given to an artist at the request of the public during his presentation.
This award was created to avoid delivery of the "Gaviotas" to an artist at the request of the public. However, public pressure urged the delivery of as many "Antorchas" as "Gaviotas", as this prize the second given to an artist before the delivery of the "Gaviota de Plata". It was definitively replaced by the "Gaviota de Plata" in the LVI Viña Festival.

Road to Survival

Road to Survival is a 1948 book by William Vogt. It was a major inspiration for the modern environmentalist movement.
Summary.
"Road to Survival" is a summary of the ecological status of the world. Vogt documented the negative effects of an expanding global population on the environment. He gathered reports of deforestation, gullying, overgrazing, soil erosion and many forms of destruction of fundamental resources which has arisen from the greed and ignorance of mankind.
Vogt argued that since food production cannot keep pace with the increase in world population, the only solution is universal birth control. Vogt attacks capitalism, and describes United States history as a "march of destruction".
The book is filled with scientific data, and its world-wide scope was unusual at the time. Ultimately, the book advocates population control as the only way to prevent environmental disaster. Human population could not exceed the planet's carrying capacity without disaster.
Reception.
The book was commercially successful. A condensed version was published in "Reader's Digest", and many universities used the book as a textbook. However, his message was attacked by ideologues of all varieties, by conservatives for opposing capitalism and supporting birth control, and by liberals as proof of "science's bankruptcy in the face of pressing modern problems".
A 1949 review in the "Geography" journal concluded that "the survey of the causes and consequences of soil erosion in the several regions
of the world is a valuable one and although many will quarrel with the author's political and ethical views the thesis presents a challenge that will be a great stimulus to thinking about some of the big issues presented."
Later on, the book would inspire the modern environmental movement, with both Rachel Carson and Paul Ehrlich being inspired by it.

Afterworlds

Afterworlds is a fiction novel by "New York Times" bestselling author Scott Westerfeld that was published on September 23, 2014. The slogan for the book is, "Darcy writes the words. Lizzie lives them."
Plot.
Darcy Patel has put college and everything else on hold to move to New York to rewrite and publish her teen novel, 'Afterworlds'. Arriving with no apartment or friends she wonders whether she's made the right decision, until she falls in with a crowd of other seasoned and fledgling writers who take her under their wings. Darcy weathers on through the whirlwind that is a first publication and learns multiple lessons not just in YA writing, but also in romance and relationships. Told in alternating chapters is Darcy's novel, a suspenseful thriller about Lizzie, a teen who slips into the Afterworld to survive a terrorist attack. Upon venturing into the underworld, Lizzie meets another mortal afterlife transcender who has been in the Afterworld for thousands of years and attempts to support Lizzie’s transition as a psychopomp. But the Afterworld is a place between the living and the dead, and as Lizzie drifts between our world and that of the Afterworld, she discovers that many unsolved - and terrifying - stories need to be reconciled.
Reception.
The majority of the reviews for "Afterworlds" are positive and applaud Westerfeld for representing the passion of reading and writing in Darcy. Most reviewers felt that Darcy's story was the stronger of the two. Stephanie Zacharek of the "New York Times" writes, "the otherworldly story Darcy has invented for Lizzie isn't nearly as compelling as Darcy's real-world one." Tasha Robinson of NPR writes, "while Lizzie's story is briskly thrilling, it's ultimately more valuable as a window into Darcy's mind."

Reception.
Critical response.
The series has been met with a mixed response from critics upon its premiere. Based on 15 reviews, the first season holds a 60% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 5.42 out of 10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Despite an enticing cast and promising premise, "Tell Me a Story"s overly plotted, grim take on Grimm's Fairy Tales fails to enchant." Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 45 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews."
In a positive review, "Refinery29"s Sesali Bowen commended the series saying, ""Tell Me A Story" captures its viewers to put themselves in the shoes of some of their favorite fables with its realism. So far it's better for it. This new CBS All Access program has enough to stand on without it thanks to an array of characters who are interesting if not a little cliche." In a more mixed critique, "Variety"s offered the series qualified praise saying, "For all its faults, the series is enthusiastically pulpy, moving with a propulsive energy that, to be frank, most streaming dramas lack. It's not nearly operating on the same prescient level as, say, "The Good Fight", nor quite the radical re-imagining of fairy tales as advertised. But if nothing else, "Tell Me a Story's" got a wicked bite that might serve it well when trying to grab curious viewers on a streaming platform that doesn't quite have anything else like it." In an outright negative assessment, "RogerEbert.com"s Brian Tallerico criticized the series saying, "There are talented TV veterans in "Tell Me a Story", likely lured by Williamson's pedigree, but even they fail to give what could reasonably be called good performances. The pacing, the dialogue, the (complete lack of) visual language, the world building—it's impossible to point to a single element that works."
Home media.
The first season was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 1, 2019.

Clayton Kirkpatrick

Clayton Kirkpatrick (January 8, 1915 – June 19, 2004) was the editor of the "Chicago Tribune" newspaper from 1969 until 1979. He is credited with modernizing the "Tribune", shifting its news coverage and editorial page away from reflexive partisanship and—in a famous editorial—calling for the resignation of President Richard Nixon in 1974.
Early life and education.
Kirkpatrick grew up in Waterman, Illinois, the son of an operator of a machine shop and garage. Kirkpatrick graduated in 1937 from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.
Career.
After itinerant jobs around the country, Kirkpatrick joined Chicago's City News Bureau in late January 1938. Kirkpatrick had hoped for a job at the "Chicago Daily News" but instead joined the "Tribune" in 1938, where his first jobs were as a general-assignment reporter and then covering the federal courts.
In 1942, Kirkpatrick enlisted in the United States Army, working in Army intelligence and mostly spending his time stationed in England. Kirkpatrick rose up to become a master sergeant was awarded the Bronze Star. He was discharged in November 1945.
Kirkpatrick spent 15 years as a reporter at the "Tribune" before becoming a copy editor in 1954. He then served as make-up editor, chief of the neighborhood news sections and an assignment editor. More promotions followed, as Kirkpatrick was named city editor in 1961, assistant managing editor in 1963, managing editor in 1965 and executive editor in 1967.
Kirkpatrick was named the "Tribune" editor on January 1, 1969. He immediately replaced the "Tribune" partisan writing and reporting with balanced, objective coverage.
Kirkpatrick also altered the design and layout of the "Tribune", adding new sections geared toward reader interests. The changes wound up influencing the broader newspaper world. In February 1974, "Time" magazine named the "Tribune" one of the nation's 10 best newspapers.
Watergate.
In 1974, Kirkpatrick sought for the "Tribune" to become the first newspaper to publish the Watergate scandal transcripts in their entirety. Kirkpatrick and the "Tribune" Washington reporters negotiated with Nixon's press secretary, Ron Ziegler, to get the transcripts early and then fly the transcripts on a company jet to Chicago, where a task force quickly prepared them for publication. They were published in a 44-page special section.
One week later, Kirkpatrick, who previously had been a Nixon supporter, concluded after reading the transcripts that the "Tribune" should call for Nixon's resignation. He authored a May 9, 1974, editorial that used uncharacteristically blunt language in stating that it was time for Nixon to resign. "We saw the public man in his first administration, and we were impressed. Now in about 300,000 words we have seen the private man, and we are appalled", the editorial read. "The key word here is immoral. It is a lack of concern for morality, a lack of concern for high principles, a lack of commitment to the high ideals of public office that make the transcripts a sickening exposure of the man and his advisers ... He is humorless to the point of being inhumane. He is devious. He is vacillating. He is profane. He is willing to be led. He displays dismaying gaps in knowledge. He is suspicious of his staff. His loyalty is minimal." The editorial concluded: "The President is right in urging a quick end to the Watergate affair. His country needs a swift and merciful termination of this agony. Two roads are open. One is resignation. The other is impeachment. Both are legitimate and would satisfy the need to observe due process."
That the editorial came from the "Tribune"—a paper that long had been synonymous with Republican politics—made it especially influential both in the U.S. and overseas.
Later life.
In 1979, Kirkpatrick was promoted to become president and CEO of the Tribune Company. He retired on June 1, 1981.
After retiring, Kirkpatrick, an enthusiastic golfer, served on the board of the Cantigny Trust and urged his fellow board members to approve plans for a 27-hole golf course, called the Cantigny Golf Club, on the grounds of the estate of former "Tribune" publisher Robert R. McCormick.
Personal.
Kirkpatrick was married to Thelma Kirkpatrick for 55 years until her death in 1998. He had four children and lived in Glen Ellyn, Illinois.
Kirkpatrick died on June 19, 2004, at his home of congestive heart failure.

One Dollar (TV series)

One Dollar is an American mystery thriller drama streaming television series created by Jason Mosberg that premiered on August 30, 2018 on CBS All Access. The series centers on the denizens of a small rust belt community and shifts perspective from person to person as a dollar bill changes hands. The ensemble cast consists of John Carroll Lynch, Nathaniel Martello-White, Philip Ettinger, Christopher Denham, Kirrilee Berger, Joshua Bitton, Níkẹ Uche Kadri, Gracie Lawrence, and Hamilton Clancy. On December 12, 2018, it was announced that the series had been canceled after one season.
Premise.
"One Dollar" is set in "a small rustbelt town in post-recession America, where a one-dollar bill changing hands connects a group of characters involved in a shocking multiple murder. The path of the dollar bill, and point of view in each episode, paints a picture of a modern American town with deep class and cultural divides that spill out into the open as the town's secrets get revealed."
Production.
Development.
On August 1, 2017, it was announced that CBS All Access had given the production, then titled "$1", a series order. The series was created by Jason Mosberg and was set to be executive produced by Matt DeRoss, Alexandre Dauman, and Craig Zobel, who was also expected to direct. Production companies involved with the series were slated to include CBS Television Studios and Anonymous Content. On July 2, 2018, it was announced that the series had been retitled "One Dollar" and that it would premiere on August 30, 2018. On December 12, 2018, it was announced that CBS All Access had canceled the series.
Casting.
On March 6, 2018, it was announced that John Carroll Lynch, Philip Ettinger, Chris Denham, Nathaniel Martello-White, Kirrilee Berger, and Gracie Lawrence had joined the main cast as series regulars and that Jeff Perry, Leslie Odom Jr., and Sturgill Simpson were cast in recurring roles. Later that month, the cast was rounded out with the addition of Nike Kadri, Joshua Bitton, and Hamilton Clancy as series regulars and Ashlie Atkinson as a recurring guest star. On April 10, 2018, it was announced that Aleksa Palladino had joined the cast in a recurring capacity.
Filming.
Principal photography for the first season began on March 27, 2018 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
Release.
On July 2, 2018, a promotional poster for the series was released. On August 5, 2018, a teaser trailer for the series was released. On August 13, 2018, the official trailer was released.
Reception.
The series has been met with a generally positive response from critics upon its premiere. On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds an 80% approval rating, with an average rating of 6 out of 10 based on 10 reviews. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 64 out of 100 based on 6 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews."
In a positive review, "Los Angeles Times"s Robert Lloyd praised the series saying, "The excellence of the acting and the admirable, one might almost say English naturalism of the production balance the sometimes improbable, even implausible action and the occasional sacrifice of sense to drama; it is true that in life, people do not act sensibly, but fictional characters should be held to a higher standard of consistency. Still, the writing gives the actors a lot to play with." In a more mixed critique, "TV Guide"s Liam Mathews discussed the show's various sub-plots saying, "They writers are much more interested in the vignettes that build out the town...These smaller side stories give the show an indie movie-like texture about people trying to make it in America. They're sort of like short films within the bigger show, and they contain much of the show's best writing and acting. They would be better if they didn't have the unnecessary dollar bill gimmick connecting them all, but it's not that distracting." In an outright negative assessment, "The Hollywood Reporter"s Tim Goodman criticized the series saying, "There's not enough good writing here, not enough motivation to follow characters that are either intentionally half-baked or are merely uninteresting. Characters have quirks, but the quirks prove there's not much else there. Smart people eventually do exceptionally dumb things."

Zdeněk Bakala (born 7 February 1961) is a Czech entrepreneur and investor. He is a stakeholder in mining, energy, financial businesses and owns the media company Economia, the publisher of "Hospodářské noviny" and "Respekt" magazine among others. As of 2017, Bakala is the tenth wealthiest person in the Czech Republic according to "Forbes". His philanthropic activities are directed via the Bakala Foundation.
In September 2018, Bakala found a lawsuit in federal court in Beaufort, South Carolina in which he claims that a controversional Slovak businessman Pavol Krúpa has initiated frivolous lawsuits, promoted death threats on Facebook and instigated criminal investigations targeting him. The lawsuit also says that Krupa threatened to send soccer hooligans to protest in front of Bakala's home in Switzerland and ultimately demanded a payment of 500 million Czech koruna (US$23 million) in 2017, as a compensation for losses suffered by buying Bakala's New World Resources stock, to stop. According to the complaint, when Bakala rejected that offer, Krupa hired Beverly Hills, California-based Crowds on Demand “to bring his campaign of defamation, extortion, and harassment to the U.S.”

M. Walter F. Abeykoon

Morawakkorakoralege Walter Fonseka Abeykoon (30 April 1903 - 19??) was a Ceylonese civil servant and served as the Inspector General of Police between 1959 and 1963.
Education.
Abeykoon received his education at Ananda College, Colombo and at the University College, Colombo gaining a BSc degree from the University of London. 
Public service career.
He was appointed to the Survey Department in July 1929 by the Governor. He was promoted to Assistant Superintended of Surveys in July 1932 and was seconded to the Land Settlement Department as an Assistant Settlement Officer in February 1932. In October 1937 he was appointed Assistant Settlement Officer. In December 1941 he was appointed Assistant Government Agent (Emergency), Ambalangoda and acted as Assistant Government Agent, Galle in June and July 1944. He resumed his duties as Assistant Settlement Officer in January 1947 and became the Acting Settlement Officer in May 1951 before being confirmed as the Settlement Officer in 1954.
Inspector General of Police.
He was appointed as Inspector General of Police (IGP) on 1 May 1959 by his personal friend and bridge partner, Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike. The appointment was highly controversial as the Prime Minister appointed Abeykoon from outside the service by-passing a number of senior career police officers, on the basis Abeykoon was a Sinhala Buddhist. Senior police officers protested and DIG C. C. Dissanayake tendered his resignation, which was later withdrawn. The appointment was made by Bandaranaike after removed the then IGP Osmund de Silva the first Ceylonese to be appointed as IGP from within the force, who had refused Bandaranaike's requested for police intervention against trade union action occurring at Colombo Harbour. De Silva declined to do the Prime Minister's bidding on the basis that he believed the request was not lawful. On 24 April 1959, de Silva was compulsorily retired from the police force with Abeyakoon subsequently appointed in his place.
Attempted coup.
In 1962, when an coup d'état attempted by senior officers of the military and police, Abeykoon was caught off guard. Early warning from one of conspirators allowed the government to respond in time. In 1963, Prime Minister Sirima Bandaranaike replaced Abeykoon with DIG S. A. Dissanayake, who was instrumental in countering the 1962 coup, following Abeykoon's retirment in April 1963.
Family.
His brother M. K. Walter Fonseka Abeykoon (1901-1982) was the Senior Assistant Registrar at the University of Ceylon and the first Registrar at the Vidyalankara University, Kelaniya.

Turkiston Palace () is an arts venue in the capital city of Tashkent in Uzbekistan. It was opened on the initiative of the President of Uzbekistan Islam Karimov in 1993 in honor of the second anniversary of the Independence of Uzbekistan. The building of the palace, prior to Uzbek independence, lacked funding for many years and was in a state of "long-term construction". On March 30, 1993, by resolution of the Cabinet of Ministers of Uzbekistan, it was decided to name the new Palace "Turkiston". In January 2004, the palace was placed under the jurisdiction of the Tashkent City Administration, and in February 2017, the Palace was transferred to the Ministry of Culture by order of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev. It is the main venue for various public events including state holidays. Also, the embassies of many foreign countries hold national and cultural events, conferences, exhibitions, and contests in the palace. It has two main theatrical halls, the Winter Hall, and the Summer Amphitheater, each being made for the winter and summer respectively.

Kalladar

Kalladar (Tamil: கல்லாடர்), also known as Kalladanar (Tamil: கல்லாடனார்), was a poet of the Sangam period, known for authoring 14 verses of the Sangam literature, besides verse 9 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai.
Biography.
Kalladar hailed from a town called Kalladam (hence the name 'Kalladar'), which is in the modern-day Kerala. Rulers sung by Kalladar include Ambarkilan Aruvandhai, Mullur king Kari, Ori, Akdhai, Pandiyan Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, Venkatamalai ruler Kalvar Koman Pulli, Poraiyatru Kilan Periyan, Nannan, and Kalangaai Kanni Narmudicheral. Other poets who also sung about the Pandiyan King Thalaiyalangaanatthu Seruvendra Neduncheliyan, including Kudapulaviyanar, Mangudi Kilar, and Mangudi Marudhanar, were thus his contemporaries. With his friendship with Mamulanar, he formed part of the Kallada–Mamulanar dyad.
Contribution to the Sangam literature.
Kalladar has written verses in Kurunthogai (verses 260 and 269), Agananuru (verses 9, 63, 113, 171, 199, 209, 333), and Purananuru (verses 23, 25, 371, 385, 391). The chief themes that Kalladar handled in his verses include battlefield, consequences of battles, and the plights of widows of the slain soldiers. He has also composed verse 9 of the Tiruvalluva Maalai. But this Kalladar is likely to be a namesake who wrote these verses in venba meter, centuries after the Sangam period. He is also believed to have written a commentary on the Tolkappiyam.
A later work of "Kallaadam", unlike one would guess, was not authored by Kalladar. The Tamil land must have seen at least three Kalladars, if not four.

Asher Naim

Asher Naim (December 28, 1929 – November 11, 2016) is an Israeli diplomat who has served in Israeli missions to the United States,
Finland, Ethiopia, United Nations, and South Korea. Naim was Israel's ambassador to Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991 and played a crucial role in the 1991 Operation Solomon which airlifted around 14,200 Ethiopian Jews to Israel in a single day.
Early life and education.
Naim was born in Tripoli, Libya, and he moved to Israel with his family in 1944. He graduated from Hebrew University of Jerusalem and held a master's degree in Jurisprudence.
Career.
Naim has served in Israel's Foreign Ministry from 1956 until his retirement in 1999. He started his career as a cultural and press Attaché in Tokyo (1956 - 1960), where he had also taught Hebrew at Tokyo University. In 1960, he was sent to Kenya, which was then a British colony but in the process of gaining independence, in the hope of building diplomatic relations with Kenya once it became an independent state. While in Kenya, Naim worked closely with Kenyan leader Jomo Kenyatta, who later became the first president of Kenya, and paved the way to fruitful relations between Kenya and Israel. Naim later served in Washington D.C. from 1968 to 1973 as an assistant to Ambassador Yitzhak Rabin and then as the consul general of Israel in Philadelphia from 1976 to 1981. Later, Naim served as an Ambassador in Finland from 1988 to 1990, and then in Ethiopia from 1990 to 1991. After a brief stint at the United Nations, he completed his career as Ambassador to South Korea from 1992 to 1995.
Operation Solomon.
In 1990, Ethiopia's long-lasting civil war came to an end, and the Mengistu government was about to be toppled. Israel was concerned for an ancient community of Jews (Beta Israel) who have been living in Ethiopia for three thousand years. which was the main reason that Naim was sent to Ethiopia. 
Naim was instrumental in the process of negotiating with Ethiopia's then President Mengistu Haile Mariam. Operation Solomon was launched on May 21, 1991. It involved 41 flights, 37 airplanes, lasted for 25 hours, and 14,200 Ethiopian Jews were taken to Israel. Because of Naim's crucial role in Operation Solomon, he was awarded the highest recognition by Israel's President Chaim Herzog.
Legacy.
After evacuating thousands of Ethiopian Jews to Israel, absorbing the immigrants to the mainstream Israeli society became the greatest challenge. Although officially retired in 1999, Naim continued to draw support for Ethiopian Jews, the group of people that he had helped save. Naim, along with other mainly American philanthropists, founded a scholarship fund (Keren Hanan Aynor Foundation) to support young Ethiopians who lived in Israel and wished to attend college and graduate schools.
Death.
Asher Naim passed at his home in Jerusalem after a long illness on November 11, 2016. He is survived by his wife Hilda, his children Ronit Zohar, Ari Naim and Gideon Naim, as well as 7 grandchildren, and many siblings and extended family.

Mount Macedon Memorial Cross

The Mount Macedon Memorial Cross is a heritage-listed war memorial at 405 Cameron Drive, Mount Macedon, Macedon Ranges Shire, Victoria, Australia. It is also known as the Cameron Memorial Cross. It was listed on the Victorian Heritage Register on 1 September 1994.
History.
The Mount Macedon Memorial Cross was planned and constructed for local land owner William Cameron. In addition to desiring to honour the war dead of World War I, Cameron wanted to create employment during the Great Depression. On Saturday 16 March 1935, the Victorian Premier, Stanley Argyle, officially dedicated the memorial to the Australian service people killed in the First World War. Over 400 people attended the ceremony despite the bitter wind and rain. The monument cost which was paid by William Cameron except for contributed by Gisborne Shire Council.
Although it withstood lightning strikes and bushfires over the years, eventually the cross's internal steel structure weakened and was assessed as being at risk of falling down. After a number of years of planning, in 1995 the monument was replaced with a visually identical replica but was constructed with solid reinforced concrete which is expected to be longer lasting.
Description.
The cross is in a reserve near the summit of Mount Macedon and is reached by a access road. The cross is high with a plinth and rests on a circular base in diameter. It is constructed of pale yellow Wunderlich terracotta tiles on a steel base. It can be seen from a great distance from the plains below the mountain.
A tablet on the monument has the words: "To the glory of God and in memory of Australia's sons, 1914-1918. Death cannot rob them of their glory nor time efface the memory of their gallant deeds."
Significance.
The Mount Macedon (Cameron) Memorial Cross is important for spiritual, symbolic cultural and social reasons. The Cross is important as a memorial for those who lost their lives in the First World War and became for many a symbol of courage and survival after the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires. The war dead are commemorated at a dawn service held at the base of the cross on Anzac Day each year. The size, simplicity of the design of the Cameron Memorial Cross, along with its siting on Mount Macedon, is a rare example of a memorial commemorating those who died in the First World War. It is able to demonstrate an association with an important event in Victoria's history, the First World War, and it demonstrates the use of particular material in the form of Wunderlich tiles which, because of their reflective nature, are able to enhance the simplicity and symbolism of the Cross, and enable it to be viewed from considerable distances.
It is considered Victoria's most significant war memorial after the Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne.

Jake Rozhansky

Jake Michael Rozhansky (, born July 4, 1996) is an American soccer player who plays as a midfielder for USL League One club New England Revolution II. During his career, he has previously appeared for D.C. United U-23, Maccabi Netanya, Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem, Hapoel Afula, and Maccabi Herzliya.
Born in Germantown, Maryland, Rozhansky attended Montgomery Blair High School and played youth soccer with the Olney Rangers and Bethesda Olney clubs. He played his first two collegiate seasons at Virginia, winning a national title with the Cavaliers as a freshman, before transferring and spending his final two seasons at Maryland. While in college, Rozhansky appeared with D.C. United U-23 and represented the United States at the 2017 Maccabiah Games. He was drafted by Columbus Crew SC in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft, but instead chose to go overseas and sign in Israel with Maccabi Netanya. After two seasons with Netanya and a loan spell at Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem, Rozhansky joined Hapoel Afula in 2019.
A native-born American citizen, Rozhansky claimed Israeli citizenship as an adult through the Law of Return.
Early life.
Rozhansky was born on July 4, 1996 in Germantown, Maryland. He attended Montgomery Blair High School, but played just one year of high school soccer for the Blazers, instead spending his youth at the club level with Olney Rangers and Bethesda Olney. He won the Golden Ball at the 2013 US Youth Soccer National Championships during his final year with Olney Rangers. With Bethesda Olney, Rozhansky was part of the club's first team to take part in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy (USSDA), where they qualified for the national final. Among his teammates at Bethesda Olney were Jeremy Ebobisse, Chase Gasper, Carter Manley, and Gedion Zelalem.
While still in high school, Rozhansky was called up to multiple youth national team camps. In July 2012, he took part in a training camp for the United States U17 national team. Two years later, he was called up by the under-20s for a training camp in Raleigh, North Carolina. Rozhansky appeared in three exhibition matches during this camp, but never officially earned a cap at either level for the United States. He was the subject of interest from English club Arsenal in 2012, but ultimately was not pursued by the Premier League side. Rozhansky committed to play college soccer at the University of Virginia. He was part of a recruiting class that also included Jeff Caldwell and Peter Pearson.
College and amateur.
Rozhansky made his Virginia debut on August 29, 2014, playing the entirety of a 1–0 victory over 25th-ranked Old Dominion. He started all but two matches during his freshman season, helping the Cavaliers become national champions after defeating UCLA on penalties in the College Cup. In the second round of the NCAA Tournament, Rozhansky tallied his first collegiate goal to help Virginia advance past UNC Wilmington. He finished the season with one goal and four assists in 23 appearances and was named to both the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) All-Freshman Team and the College Cup All-Tournament Team.
Ahead of his sophomore year, Rozhansky was called up by the United States U23 national team, taking part in a college identification camp in the lead-up to the 2015 CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship. In the collegiate season, he led the Cavaliers in scoring, tallying four goals in 14 appearances, although he did miss four matches due to injury. That goal-scoring mark included strikes in three straight games in September and a goal against Rider in the first round of the 2015 NCAA Tournament. Rozhansky was named to the All-ACC Second Team at the end of the season. He initially left school to trial with clubs in Europe, including a stint at SC Freiburg in Germany, but instead returned to college and decided to transfer. He finished his time at Virginia with five goals and four assists in 37 appearances.
After also considering Georgetown and UCLA, Rozhansky transferred to Maryland ahead of his junior season. He made his debut for the Terrapins in the 2016 season opener against UCLA, a match that ended in a 1–1 draw. He tallied his first Maryland goal on September 13, providing the match-winner in a double-overtime victory over Rutgers, then scored twice more before the end of the month. Rozhansky finished the season with three goals and eight assists in 21 appearances. He was named as a team captain ahead of his senior season, alongside George Campbell and Chase Gasper. In the 2018 season opener, Rozhansky tallied his first career multi-goal game, helping the Terrapins defeat Santa Clara by a 4–2 scoreline. He added a goal in September and one more in the first week of October, finishing the year with four goals and a team-high nine assists in 19 appearances. At the end of the year, Rozhansky was named to the All-Big Ten Conference First Team. He finished his Maryland career with seven goals and 17 assists from 40 appearances.
D.C. United U-23.
Following his freshman season at Virginia, Rozhansky appeared for D.C. United U-23 in the Premier Development League (PDL). He appeared in six matches and scored three goals for the club, including a brace against Baltimore Bohemians in June. During the summer of 2017, Rozhansky was also with the team, but the U-23s were not part of a league and only played exhibition matches.
Maccabiah Games.
Ahead of his senior year of college, Rozhansky was selected to the United States squad to take part in the 2017 Maccabiah Games; the team also included Sam Raben. He appeared in all six matches the Americans played in the tournament, finishing as the Golden Boot winner with six goals. In the championship match against Great Britain, Rozhansky scored a hat trick to carry the United States to a 3–0 victory. He later credited the tournament with opening the door for him to sign professionally in Israel, saying “If I hadn't gone to the Maccabiah Games I would not have decided to come play professionally in Israel. The Games provided me a way to further my professional career.”
Club career.
Rozhansky was selected to take part in the 2018 MLS Combine, but dropped out and instead chose to sign overseas. Although he had already signed a contract in Israel, Rozhansky was still selected 44th overall in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft by Columbus Crew SC, who retained his Major League Soccer rights for two seasons.
Maccabi Netanya.
After impressing during an initial trial, Rozhansky signed his first professional contract with newly-promoted Israeli Premier League club Maccabi Netanya on January 11, 2018. Since he is Jewish, Rozhansky was able to claim Israeli citizenship and was classified as a domestic player. He made his debut for Netanya on January 29, replacing Aviv Avraham in the 84th minute of a 2–1 victory against Beitar Jerusalem. He earned his first start for the club two weeks later, getting the nod for an away fixture against Hapoel Haifa and playing 45 minutes in a 2–0 defeat. Rozhansky made 13 appearances for the Diamonds after signing, helping the club to a fifth-place league finish. His initial six-month contract expired in June, but on May 13 the club extended Rozhansky's contract for two more seasons.
2018–19: Loan to Hapoel Katamon.
Rozhansky began the 2018–19 season in the squad at Netanya, appearing in all five of the club's matches in the Toto Cup Al. In order to gain playing time, however, he was sent on loan on September 11, joining Hapoel Katamon Jerusalem in the Liga Leumit. Rozhansky made his debut in the second tier the next day, coming off the bench in a 1–0 victory against Hapoel Petah Tikva. His first start for Katamon came on September 25 in the final of the Toto Cup Leumit, a 1–0 victory against Hapoel Marmorek that saw the club win their first-ever cup title. Rozhansky continued to be a regular presence in the club's lineup throughout the season, although he primarily appeared as a substitute: 17 of his 28 league appearances on the year came off the bench. He tallied his first goal for the club, and his first professional goal, on April 15, providing the winning margin in a 2–1 victory over Hapoel Nazareth Illit. Rozhansky scored one goal in 31 appearances in all competitions for Hapoel Katamon, to go with his five appearances on the year for Maccabi Netanya. At the end of the season, however, he was informed by Netanya manager Slobodan Drapić that he was no longer in the club's plans and with one year left on his contract should look for a new club.
Hapoel Afula.
After ending his contract with Netanya, Rozhansky joined Liga Leumit club Hapoel Afula on June 21, 2019. He signed for one year with an option for a second season. Just weeks before the season began, it was revealed that Rozhansky was one of seven players who could not be registered as the club did not have the money to pay their salaries. It was rumored that he may have to be released for the club to become financially compliant, but Rozhansky was eventually registered as a Hapoel Afula player. He missed the Toto Cup Leumit due to the confusion, eventually making his debut for Afula on September 23 in a league defeat against Hapoel Ashkelon. He scored his lone goal for the club on December 9, tallying the only score of a 1–0 victory over Hapoel Ramat Gan. Rozhansky departed the club at the end of the season after tallying one goal from 30 appearances, helping Afula stay in Liga Leumit through the relegation playoffs.
Maccabi Herzliya.
On September 3, 2020, Rozhansky dropped down a division to sign with Liga Alef club Maccabi Herzliya.
New England Revolution II.
Rozhansky returned to the United States on April 1, 2021 and signed with USL League One club New England Revolution II.
Personal life.
Rozhansky is the oldest of two children to his parents, Roman Rozhansky and Irina Matthews. Both of his parents were born in the Soviet Union, with his father from what is now Belarus and his mother from present-day Ukraine. Although he does not hold a passport from either of those countries, Rozhansky claimed Israeli citizenship as an adult through the Law of Return.
Rozhansky majored in government and politics while in college. After transferring to Maryland, he lived in the same dormitory as Sebastian Elney and Diego Silva.

James Adedokun Adegoke Akunraaledoye II

James Adedokun Adegoke (1934–2017) was a teacher and football referee who became Apetumodu of Ipetumodu in 1992. He is from Asalu compound of Fagbemokun ruling house of Ipetumodu.
Background.
Adegoke was born into the Asalu branch of the Fagbemokun ruling house of Ipetumodu in 1934. His parents were Prince Emmanuel Akanni Adegoke and Madam Elizabeth Olasunkanmi Oni Adegoke.
He spent the early part of his childhood with his maternal grandmother at Oke-Osin, Yakoyo. He moved to Ipetumodu when he reached school age and attended several primary schools until he finished his primary school education at Christ School in 1951.
He worked as a store clerk at Ipetumodu, Edunabon and Sekona until 1955 when he taught for one year at Christ Apostolic Church School, Ifetedo. From there, he gained admission into the Divisional Teacher Training College, Ile-lfe, where he obtained the Grade 3 Teachers' Certificate in 1957.
He taught for the next two years until he went to St. Andrew's College, Oyo where he obtained his Grade 2 Teachers' Certificate in December, 1961. He went back to teaching and ended up at CAC. School, Ikire, as the headmaster in 1966. He remained in Ikire Area for the rest of his working career, working in Ikire and Ikoyi as a teacher and headmaster in many primary, modern and secondary schools until he retired in 1989. Except for the one year he spent at the University of Lagos in 1972 on a teacher's diploma course in Yoruba Studies, Adegoke spent all his adult working life in and around Ikire.
Adegoke developed a keen interest in sports very early in life. Everywhere he taught from 1955 until he retired in 1989, he was popular as a games master, leading many of his schools' teams to victory not only in athletics but also in football. It was in football that he became well recognised, not only as a technical Adviser to the Oyo State Sports Council, but also as a member of the Nigerian Referees' Association, of which he became the National Vice President from 1988 to 1989. He was a member of the 1st Osun State Sports Council and handled many important national and international football matches.
An avid student of Yoruba culture, Adegoke was interested in the cultural life of the people. His achievements in this field date back to the old days of the Western Region Festival of the Arts which used to take place in Ibadan. In 1964, his dancing group represented Ife Division at the Festival. The group presented Oluro dance and came second in the Cultural Dance category.
Reign.
Adegoke's journey to the throne began in 1970 when he unsuccessfully contested for the vacant stool of Apetumodu. He was not discouraged, and when the stool became vacant again in 1986, he made his interest known. This time he was successful. His candidature was agreed upon by the kingmakers on 20 October 1988. After a successful court case, His Royal Eminence Oba Okunade Sijuwade Olubuse II, Oluaye and Ooni of Ife, consented to Adegoke's appointment on 4 March 1992. The then Executive Governor of Osun State, Alhaji Isiaka Adetunji Adeleke, gave the formal approval of the Osun State Government on 10 April 1992. Adegoke was installed as the 25th Apetumodu of Ipetumodu on 17 April 1992, from which date he was confined to Ilofi where he was prepared for traditional roles. He remained in Ilofi until 17 July 1992, when he moved to the Aafin.
During his reign, Ipetumodu was peaceful and witnessed appreciable development. Federal Government Girls College, Oduduwa University and Akinola International Market, Magistrates Court, District Customary Court, and Immigration Office were established.
Personal life.
Adegoke had children and grandchildren.
He died in November 2017.

Marcus Titius Lustricus Bruttianus

Marcus Titius Lustricus Bruttianus was a Roman senator and general of the early 2nd century AD. He was suffect consul in the "nundinium" of September to December 108 as the colleague of Quintus Pompeius Falco. Until the discovery of an inscription bearing a list of the offices he held, all that was known about him was the year of his consulate and an anecdote forming the subject of one of Pliny the Younger's letters.
His "cursus honorum" is known from an inscription found between 2011 and 2014 at Vasio (modern Vaison-la-Romaine) in the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis; this has led some experts to suspect this was Bruttianus' hometown. The first office Bruttianus is known to have held was as quaestor of Achaea; this inscription also states he was military tribune for an unknown legion, but it is uncertain whether he held that commission before or after his quaestorship. Upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy, Bruttianus would have been enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: aedile and praetor. He is also attested as having been appointed "legatus" or assistant to the proconsular governor of Africa.
After stepping down from the praetorship, he was twice "legatus legionis" or commander of two legions. This was an unusual arrangement, and Anthony Birley was able to list only thirty-three men known to have commanded more than one legion -- which did not include Bruttianus. The first was Legio I Italica, which served in Trajan's Dacian Wars. During his command, Bruttianus demonstrated heroism which resulted in the award of "dona militaria" by the emperor Trajan. Bruttianus was also governor of two provinces: the public province of Achaea, and the imperial province of Cilicia. 
Pliny's letter that recounts an event in Bruttianus' life has been dated around the years 106-7, which was prior to his consulate. He caught a close friend, Montanius Atticinus, engaging in criminal activity and reported it by letter to Trajan; Atticinus responded by making an accusation against Bruttianus. According 
to Pliny, who was a "juridicus" at the hearing, Bruttianus presented his will, which was written in Atticinus' handwriting, as proof that they were intimate friends, then presented clear evidence of the other's crimes, which apparently involved tampering with legal documents and the subversion of a clerk's slave. Trajan ruled against Atticinus, and banished him to an island. Pliny notes that Bruttianus' reputation for honesty was strengthened and his fame increased.
The inscription attests to a number of offices Bruttianus held after his consulate. He was general of the army in Germania Superior and Inferior, then admitted to the "Septemviri epulonum", one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods, and finally was commander of the army in Roman Judea and Roman Arabia.

Microtis eremicola

Microtis eremicola, commonly known as the desert mignonette orchid or dryland onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small, dull green to greenish-yellow flowers. This onion orchid is common in soil pockets on granite outcrops in inland areas, mostly between Hyden and Balladonia.
Description.
"Microtis eremicola" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and fifty dull green to yellowish-green flowers are crowded along a flowering stem tall. The flower lean downwards and are long and wide. The dorsal sepal is long and wide and forms a hood over the rest of the flower. The lateral sepals are long, wide and curl downwards. The petals are long, wide and are held under the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, long, wide and turns downwards with thickened, irregular edges and a prominently cleft tip. Flowering occurs from September to November.
Taxonomy and naming.
The desert mignonette orchid was first formally described in 1990 by Robert Bates who gave it the name "Microtis media" subsp. "eremicola" and published the description in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens". In 2004, David Jones and Mark Clements changed the name to "Microtis eremicola". The specific epithet ("eremicola") is Latin for "dweller of dry places", referring to the arid habitat of this species.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis eremicola" is one of the most common "Microtis" orchids and grows in arid areas on granite outcrops, on the edges of salt lakes and along drainage lines between Geraldton and Israelite Bay but is most common between Hyden and Balladonia.
Conservation.
"Microtis eremicola" is classified as "not threatened" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife.

"Postcards from Saigon" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter James Blundell. The song was written in 2003 as a tribute to the 48,000 Australian surviving Vietnam War veterans. The song also speaks out against the 2003 Iraq War.
In the song, the character's best friend dies in his arms in battle, later suffers a divorce and shares tragedy with a new wife who miscarries twice. In February 2005 Blundell told Nu Country ""That wasn't my brother, it's more metaphoric. I have been intrigued by the Australian role in war service. My grandfather and father were in World War I and World War II".
In 2005, the song won Australian Independent Country Music Single of the Year and Independent Country Music Male Vocalist of the Year and was commended by Kris Kristofferson.
The single was released in April 2005 as the lead single from Blundell's eighth studio album "Deluge" (2005), with royalties donated to the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and the James Blundell Scholarship for the children of Vietnam Veterans. The song peaked at number 82 on the ARIA Charts in June 2005. 
The song remained in the Country Top 30 for four months and peaked at number 2 in the Australian Independent Singles Chart.

5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel

5α-Dihydrolevonorgestrel (5α-DHLNG) is an active metabolite of the progestin levonorgestrel which is formed by 5α-reductase. It has about one-third of the affinity of levonorgestrel for the progesterone receptor. In contrast to levonorgestrel, the compound has both progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity, and hence has a selective progesterone receptor modulator-like profile of activity. This is analogous to the case of norethisterone and 5α-dihydronorethisterone. In addition to the progesterone receptor, 5α-DHLNG interacts with the androgen receptor. It has similar affinity for the androgen receptor relative to levonorgestrel (34.3% of that of metribolone for levonorgestrel and 38.0% of that of metribolone for 5α-DHLNG), and has androgenic effects similarly to levonorgestrel and testosterone. 5α-DHLNG is further transformed into 3α,5α- and 3β,5α-, which bind weakly to the estrogen receptor (0.4 to 2.4% of the of ) and have weak estrogenic activity. These metabolites are considered to be responsible for the weak estrogenic activity of high doses of levonorgestrel.

Australian Christian Commonwealth

The Australian Christian Commonwealth was a weekly newspaper published by Hussey &amp; Gillingham in South Australia from 1901 to 1940.
History.
The "Australian Christian Commonwealth" was first published on 4 January 1901. Although "new", the masthead of the first edition included the subtitle "with which are incorporated The Christian Weekly &amp; Methodist Journal, The Primitive Methodist Magazine, The Bible Christian Monthly" and that it was "The Organ of the Methodist Church in South Australia, and the Champion of Evangelical Christianity." The Methodist Church of Australasia had been formed by combining several Methodist denominations in Australia. The three incorporated titles belonged to the three South Australian branches of merging denominations :– Wesleyan Methodist Church, Primitive Methodist Church and Bible Christian Church.
The newspaper began as "Vol. XIII, No. 660, [New Series]" maintaining the publication order, alongside content and design continuity, of its previous iteration, the "Christian Weekly and Methodist Journal". It continued publication until mid-1940, and was superseded by the "South Australian Methodist" (1940-1970).
Rev. Brian Wibberley Mus. Bac. was editor from 1901 to 1911.
Preservation.
The newspaper has been digitised and made available for free online by the National Library of Australia through the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Project.

Dryaderces

Dryaderces is a small genus of frogs in the family Hylidae. Their known distribution is disjunct, with one species found in the upper Amazon Basin and lower Andean slopes between central Peru and Amazonian Bolivia, and another one in Pará, Brazil. Its sister taxon is "Osteocephalus". No phenotypic synapomorphies defining the genus are known.
Etymology.
The generic name "Dryaderces" is derived from Ancient Greek "dryad" (=tree) and "aderces" (=unseen, invisible), thus meaning "unseen in a tree".
Description.
"Dryaderces" are medium-sized frogs; adult males can grow to and adult females to in snout–vent length. They are pond breeders. Males have only scattered, non-spinous tubercles on the dorsum (pond-breeding "Osteocephalus" have heavily tuberculate dorsum, with the tips of the tubercles keratinized). Females have smoother backs. Juvenile coloration resembles adult coloration (different in "Osteocephalus").
Species.
There are two species:
Before "Dryaderces" was erected, these two species were placed in "Osteocephalus". There is at least one undescribed species belonging to this genus.

D. João Manuel de Ataide, 9th Count of Arganil (Lisbon, 1570 – Lisbon, 4 July 1633) was a Portuguese prelate, Archbishop of Lisbon and Viceroy of Portugal.
Biography.
He was the fifth son of Nuno Manuel, grandson of bastardy by D. Duarte I, and D. Joana de Athayde. He received his doctorate in Theology from the University of Coimbra, and soon after was appointed canon of the See of Lisbon. Later he was appointed chief almoner of Philip II of Portugal when, in 1609, was invited to be Bishop of Viseu, taking possession of the diocese on 25 April 1610. After vacating the seat of Bishop of Guarda in 1615, he was invited to exercise that prelature, but refused. In 1625, he was transferred to the Diocese of Coimbra, thus being made Count of Arganil, the title given to Bishops of Coimbra, and bishop on May 26.
In 1632, he was appointed Archbishop of Lisbon, having his ascension confirmed in 1633 by Pope Urban VIII. King Philip III appointed him Viceroy of Portugal on 26 March 1633, and his inauguration as such on May 12. According to orders of the King, he could not make any visit and for the ecclesiastical visits, he should be accompanied by guards. By these orders, he was admitted to the Archdiocese of Lisbon by proxy, with his procurator D. Gaspar do Rêgo. He did not receive the pallium, for he died on 4 July 1633.

Changhong Zhu

Zhu Changhong is the former CIO of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Previously, he worked at PIMCO from 2006 to February 2009. Despite managing China's US$3.5 trillion foreign currency reserves, he was known as the "Invisible Man" due to his extremely low profile.
Early life and education.
Zhu is the oldest of two sons born to an intellectual and his wife. When asked if his father had suffered any backlash in the Cultural Revolution, Zhu responded that “He was re-educated and then he was fine.” Zhu graduated from the University of Chicago with a PhD in physics before starting his investment career. His thesis adviser at UChicago commented on Zhu's entrepreneurial drive and work ethics as he finished his dissertation in two years, half the usual time.
Career.
After graduating, Zhu was recruited to work in the Investment Portfolio of Bank of America's Treasury in San Francisco. He became a part of the off-balance sheet portfolio and traded Interest Rate Options to manage Bank of America’s interest rate risk. After the merger of Bank of America and Nationsbank, the executives in Charlotte, NC made it clear that the work Zhu and the other traders had done was too complicated and high tech. Zhu then went to work at PIMCO where he worked as the right-hand man of bond investor Bill H. Gross. In late 2009, he left his high-paying job at PIMCO along with two luxury mansions in Las Vegas and California to return to his country and work for China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, a move seen as patriotic and lauded by high-ranking Chinese officials.
As the Chief Investment Officer of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange and its US$3.5 trillion in foreign reserves, Zhu became "one of the most powerful investors in the world." Under Zhu's leadership, SAFE lowered its holdings of US bonds from 45% to around 35% and focused on boosting investments in Japanese equities, European debt, U.S. corporate bonds and equities. During Zhu's tenure, SAFE's foreign-exchange reserves saw a rise of 59% in total value at US$3.82 trillion at the end of 2013 from the US$2.40 trillion before his arrival.
In 2014, Zhu abruptly resigned from his post in SAFE. Peng Junming, a former SAFE official, was quoted as saying “Zhu’s departure is a big loss to SAFE, and to China.”

Regional ethnic autonomy system of China

Regional Ethnic Autonomy System (区域民族自治制度) of People's Republic of China give ethnic minorities in China a political system to assemble autonomous government body, protects ethnic minorities' rights and provides ethnic minority people benefits. It is one of the basic political systems in China. This fundamental system was aimed at achieving ethnic equality in China. The content of this system is the establishment of autonomous government body, exercising autonomous rights and enacting regional autonomy in areas where many ethnic minority people live together.
It is based on "People’s Republic of China Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law" enacted in 1984 amended in 2001 and "Provisions on Implementing the Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law" enacted in 2005.
History.
In 1941, Ethnical Regional Autonomy System was experimented by Mao Zedong led government in Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region. In the governmental principal file, ethnic Mongolian and Chinese Muslim were to establish autonomous region based on ethnical equality principle. It was a reflection against Qing dynasty's devious ethnic policy as well as a result of studying Soviet Union's ethnical policy.
In 1947, Mongolian Autonomous Region was established. After that, various autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties were established in 1950-1963 and 1979-1990, with some exceptions like Tibet Autonomous Region in 1965 and the latest Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County in 2003. Ethnic Autonomy Region were generally established in areas where more than 20% of the population is ethnic minority people.
Autonomous government body.
The autonomous government body are People's Congress and People's Government. As other Chinese political power structure. The real governmental power lies flexibly between Party's Commission and People's Government.
The administrative level of autonomous government body is principally decided by the population and area of the region. Autonomous regions is the highest level of administrative body in China, with the same status of a province, followed by autonomous prefecture and autonomous county.
Autonomous governments' rights and policy guidelines.
Autonomous government has the right to make ethnical laws, improvisingly execute specific ethnic related issues, enjoy relatively higher economic independence and higher reserve fund in central government, have a separate ethnic related budget in Chinese State Council, enjoy independent cultural control to a certain degree, use the major ethnic minority language as official language, organize local police militia. But law making and execution power need permission from National People's Congress and State Council respectively.
Ethnic minority benefit in China.
Government jobs.
The head of people's government and people's congress should be ethnic minority person.
In the people's congress, when multiple ethnicities live in the same autonomous region, every ethnicity should have representatives, especially giving low population ethnicities considerable more representative positions.
In the people's government, the consisting personals and the belonging branches should try their best to employ ethnic minority officials, and when there are ethnic minority candidates who meets the selecting criteria, they should be priorly employed.
The ratio of ethnic minority officials should correlate to the ratio of ethnic minority population in the region, when the ethnic minority population is over 1/2 of the local population, and should be higher than the ratio of ethnic minority population, when is lower than 1/2.
Bonus points in Gaokao.
According to different policies in different Chinese provincial gaokao committee, the ethnic minority students residing in ethnic autonomous regions can get free bonus points, varying from 10 to 35 in total 750 points.
Respect for ethnic custom in university.
In Chinese universities, the undergraduate education still go on by grouping students into classes. And the ethnic minority students will be asked about the special custom and culture by the supervisors. The supervisors and university staff would try to avoid taboo and offences to ethnic minorities. Due to the large number of Chinese Muslim, most Chinese universities have a specific dining section for them.

Microtis familiaris

Microtis familiaris, commonly known as the coastal mignonette orchid or coastal onion orchid is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west coastal region of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to twenty small, green to greenish-yellow, sweetly scented, widely spaced flowers. It often grows with large populations of other "Microtis" orchids but only flowers after fire.
Description.
"Microtis familiaris" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and twenty green to greenish-yellow flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are long, about wide and are sweetly scented. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped with a small point on the tip and is long, wide and hood-like. The lateral sepals are lance-shaped, long, about wide and turn back with their tips clasping the ovary. The petals are about long, wide and are partly enclosed by the dorsal sepal. The labellum is oblong, long, about wide and parallel to the ovary with a saddle-shaped callus in its centre. Flowering occurs from December to January but only after fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis familiaris" was first formally described in 1990 by Robert John Bates from a specimen collected at Boat Harbour near Denmark and the description was published in "Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens". The specific epithet ("familiaris") is a Latin word meaning "of a family or household" or "domestic", referring to the observation that this orchid often grows with other "Microtis" species.
Distribution and habitat.
The coastal mignonette orchid grows in swampy heath in coastal areas between Augusta and Esperance in the Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Warren biogeographic regions.
Conservation.
"Microtis familiaris" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Paleomerus

Paleomerus is a genus of strabopid, a group of extinct arthropods. It has been found in deposits from the Cambrian period (Atdabanian epoch). It is classified in the family Strabopidae of the monotypic order Strabopida. It contains two species, "P. hamiltoni" from Sweden and "P. makowskii" from Poland. The generic name is composed by the Ancient Greek words παλαιός ("palaiós"), meaning "ancient", and μέρος ("méros"), meaning "part" (and therefore, "ancient part").
"Paleomerus" is one of the oldest arthropods, being sometimes interpreted as the model of the first arachnomorphs. It is part of the order Strabopida, a poorly known group closely related to the aglaspidids of uncertain affinities, often being ignored by researchers and authors due to the poor preservation and abundance of their fossils. It has been suggested that "Paleomerus" and the closely related "Strabops" could be synonymous with each other, since they differ only in the size of the telson (the posteriormost division of the body) and the position of the eyes. These two genera were originally deferred by a hypothetical twelfth segment in "Paleomerus", but after the discovery and description of a fourth specimen of "P. hamiltoni", it has been shown that this segment actually represents the tail of the animal.
Description.
As the other strabopids, "Paleomerus" was a small-sized arthropod. The bigger species was "P. hamiltoni" at 9.3 centimetres (3.7 inches), while the smaller "P. makowskii" reached only 7.3 cm (2.9 in). Other Cambrian arthropods reached much greater lengths, such as the gigantic anomalocarid genus "Anomalocaris" that surpassed . Within Strabopida, the closely related "Strabops thacheri" exceeded the length of "Paleomerus" with 11 cm (4.3 in), while "Parapaleomerus sinensis" reached a total length of 9.2 cm (3.6 in).
Like some other arthropod clades, the strabopids possessed segmented bodies and jointed appendages (limbs) covered in a cuticle composed of proteins and chitin. The arthropod body is divided into two tagmata (sections); the frontal prosoma (head) and posterior opisthosoma (abdomen). The appendages were attached to the prosoma, and although they are unknown in strabopids (except for one undescribed specimen of "Parapaleomerus"), it is most likely they owned several pairs of them. Although the chemical composition of the strabopid exoskeleton is unknown, it was probably mineralized (with inorganic substances), sturdy and calcareous (containing calcium). The head of the strabopids was very short, the back was rounded and lacked trilobation (being divided in three lobes), the abdomen was composed by eleven segments and succeeded by a thick tail-like spine, the telson. In "Paleomerus", the prosoma was parabolic (approximately U-shaped), and the opisthosoma can increase or decrease in width slightly or strongly. It was very flexible, possibly being able to flex laterally and roll up itself. The telson was trapezoidal, broad and tapering. "Paleomerus" may be the best model of a primitive arachnomorph.
"Paleomerus" differs from "Strabops" only in the position of the eyes, which are farther from each other and closer to the margin than in "Strabops", and the size of the telson, being shorter and broader than in the latter.
History of research.
"Paleomerus" has two species described; all other described strabopid genera are monotypic. The Norwegian paleontologist and geologist Leif Størmer erected the genus based on two specimens (Ar. 47071, holotype, and Ar. 47073, the paratype) and tentatively classified it under the order Aglaspida in its own family, Paleomeriidae (also spelled Paleomeridae). "Paleomerus" is translated to "ancient part", with its name derived from the Ancient Greek words παλαιός ("palaiós", ancient) and μέρος ("méros", part). The designated type species, "P. hamiltoni", is named after Count Hugo Hamilton, who sent both fossils to the Swedish Museum of Natural History, Stockholm. In this species, the prosoma was short and had a parabolic shape with a somewhat concave posterior border. The posterolateral borders were rounded and lacked spines. The compound eyes appear as anterolateral reniform (bean-shaped) elevations in the surface of the prosoma. The opisthosoma increased slightly its width in the third and fourth segments, then decreased slightly until the seventh segment. All the tergites (the dorsal part of the segments) were similar, superimposing strongly on each other, with the half of the first segment being hidden under the prosoma. The rest of tergites were more slightly superimposed, indicating a great flexibility and even the ability to roll up itself. The telson was trapezoidal, but Størmer mistook it as the twelfth segment of the body, suggesting a hypothetical lanceolate (lance-shaped) or fan-shaped telson. It is estimated that the size of this species was of 9.3 cm (3.7 in) judging by the length of the paratype.
In 1971, the Swedish geologist and paleontologist Jan Bergström described a new specimen of "P. hamiltoni", RM Ar. 47170, found in the same place as the previous two. This new poorly preserved fossil contains molds of the first eleven segments, with a total corporal length estimated at 6.4 cm (2.5 in, being slightly larger than the holotype). Bergström tentatively removed Strabopidae (at that time containing "Strabops" and "Neostrabops") and Paleomeridae (only "Paleomerus") from the order Aglaspidida based on the fact that the head tagma was too short to accommodate the six pairs of appendages then assumed to be present in aglaspidids. Instead, he classified them in an uncertain order in the Merostomoidea class together with the emeraldellids. Ironically, Bergström speculated that the number of pairs of appendages present in the three genera could be fewer than seven, as well as including a possible antennal segment. This is currently observed as an overestimate. A study published by Derek Ernest Gilmor Briggs "et al." in 1979 has shown that the aglaspidid "Aglaspis spinifer" had between four and five pairs of appendages, but not six, weakening Bergström's argument.
In 1983, the Polish paleontologist Stanisław Orłowski described a second species of "Paleomerus" from the Ociesęki Sandstone Formation. Named "Paleomerus makowskii", the specific name of this species honors the professor Henryk Makowski and is known by only one specimen with an almost completely preserved exoskeleton (IGPUW/Ag/1/1, housed at the Geological Faculty, Warsaw University). In this species, the exoskeleton was ovate, increasing its width from the prosoma to the fifth segment and rapidly decreasing posteriorly. It had a convex shape, with the second and third segments being the most convex. The prosoma was smooth, short, rounded on the front and with somewhat concave posterior borders. It was 1.7 cm (0.7 in) long and 4.2 cm (1.6 in) wide. The eyes were placed anterolaterally and rose slightly from the surface of the prosoma, with the left eye being the only one preserved. While segments 1-4 are complete, segments 5-10 are partially destroyed. The first ten segments are all alike, overlapping each other almost half the length in each segment. The eleventh was very different from the rest, being longer and less broad and with a straight anterior border. Both sides bent downwards and the posterior border was rounded. This segment measured approximately 1.1 cm (0.4 in) in length and 1.9 cm (0.7 in) in width. The telson was flat and trapezoidal, with the posterior edge being concave, although this may be due to poor preservation. It measured 1.3 cm (0.5 in) long and 2 cm (0.8 in) wide. Following Størmer, Orłowski interpreted the telson as the twelfth segment. The total length of "P. makowskii" is estimated at 7.3 cm (2.9 in), with a maximum width of 5 cm (2 in). Although the outline of the body and the proportions between the prosoma and opisthosoma suggest an assignment to "Paleomerus", "P. makowskii" differs from "P. hamiltoni" in its great width and in the form of the eleventh segment and telson, as well as in the eyes, placed in elevations with vertical and straight lateral walls.
In 1997, Bergström and his partner Hou Xianguang, a Chinese paleontologist, completely removed Strabopidae (recognizing Paleomeridae as a junior synonym), as well as the family Lemoneitidae (containing "Lemoneites"), from the order Aglaspidida to erect a new order, Strabopida, this time suggesting a number of no more than two pairs of appendages. However, this new clade remained under the similarly-named Aglaspida subclass. A year later, the British paleontologists Jason Andrew Dunlop and Paul Antony Selden eliminated Strabopida from the suborder Aglaspidida and classified them as the sister taxa of the latter based on the lack of aglaspidid apomorphies (distinctive characteristics), such as the lack of genal spines (a spine placed in the posterolateral part of the prosoma). The authors who support this change have reinforced this argument by the trapezoidal form of the telson of "Paleomerus" and "Strabops", in contrast to the long styliform (pen-shaped) telson of the aglaspidids.
In 2004, the paleontologists O. Erik Tetlie and Rachel A. Moore described a fourth specimen of "P. hamiltoni" from the Mickwitzia Sandstone, PMO 201.957, housed at the Paleontologisk Museum, Oslo. Thanks to this new specimen, it was possible to confirm that "Paleomerus" did not possess twelve segments, but eleven, eliminating all the differences between Strabopidae and Paleomeridae (and therefore, making Paleomeridae redundant). It was also possible to notice an extra difference of "Paleomerus" and "Strabops", the dimensions of the telson, being shorter and wider in the first than in the last one. Finally, Tetlie and Moore conclude that the phylogenetic position of the strabopids will be difficult to determine without further material that preserves the ventral morphology. Subsequent authors have preferred to omit the strabopids from their analyses due to the poor abundance and preservation of their fossils, although the most accepted classification at the moment is of arthropods closely related to the Aglaspidida order, but not within it.
Classification.
"Paleomerus" is classified in the order Strabopida, in the clade Arachnomorpha, along with "Strabops", "Parapaleomerus" and potentially "Khankaspis". It was described originally in 1956 as an intermediate form between xiphosurans (commonly known as horseshoe crabs) and eurypterids. It would not be until 1997 when the order Strabopida was described, but there is still doubt if the exclusion of them from Aglaspidida was really correct. The current status of the strabopids is of aglaspid-like arthropods of uncertain affinities.
"Paleomerus" shares with the other strabopids a series of characteristics that distinguish them from all the other arthropods. These are an abdomen divided into eleven segments followed by a thick spine (the telson), a short head with sessile compound eyes and a rounded back. Like "Strabops", "Paleomerus" possessed prominent dorsal eyes, however, there is no evidence of this in the fossils of "Parapaleomerus".
The great similarity that "Strabops" and "Paleomerus" share has cast doubt on many authors about whether both genera are really synonymous or not. Størmer described "Paleomerus" as an intermediate form between Xiphosura and Eurypterida, only highlighting a unique feature different from "Strabops", a twelfth segment. Nevertheless, a fourth specimen of the type species found in Sweden has shown that this extra segment actually represented the telson of the animal, making them virtually indistinguishable. Although this should convert both genera into synonyms, over time more differences have been highlighted, which are the position of the eyes (closer to each other and farther from the margin in "Strabops" than in "Paleomerus") and the size of the telson (longer and narrower in "Strabops" than in "Paleomerus"), which keep them as separate but closely related genera.
The cladogram below published by Jason A. Dunlop and Paul A. Selden (1998) is based on the major chelicerate groups (in bold, Aglaspida, Eurypterida and Xiphosurida, Scorpiones and other arachnid clades) and their outgroup taxa (used as a reference group). "Strabops" and "Paleomerus" are shown as the sister taxa of Aglaspida.
Note that there are several outdated elements. For example, "Lemoneites" was remitted to the Glyptocystitida order of echinoderms in 2005.
Paleoecology.
"Paleomerus" fossils have been discovered in Lower Cambrian deposits of Sweden and Poland. The lanceolate body of "Paleomerus" could have facilitated rapid movements in the water, while the great flexibility of the abdomen would have allowed great agility and ability to spin in any direction. All this suggests that "Paleomerus" was an able swimmer who could even have rolled up itself on the sandy bottom of the sea as a method of protection. Due to the lack of knowledge of the ventral area, it is difficult to determine anything else about the paleoecology of "Paleomerus".
In the Mickwitzia Sandstone, where the specimens of "P. hamiltoni" were found, fossils of several other organisms have been found, such as the brachiopods "Mickwitzia monilifera" and "M. pretiosa", the problematic indeterminate animal "Torellella laevigata" or the salterellid "Volborthella tenuis". These and other fossils, as well as the occurrence of green mineral grains (probably glauconite), indicate that "P. hamiltoni" lived in a well ventilated marine environment. In addition, "P. makowskii" has been associated in the Ociesęki Sandstone Formation with the trilobites "Holmia kjerulf", "Kjerulfia orcina", "Schmidtiellus panowi" and "Ellipsocephalus sanctacrucensis", alongside various indeterminate species of gasteropods, brachiopods and hyoliths.

This unusual object has the largest heliocentric aphelion, semi-major axis, orbital eccentricity and orbital period of any known periodic minor planet, even larger than that of ; it is calculated to reach several thousand AU (Earth-Sun) distances at the farthest extent of its orbit.
Orbit and classification.
 orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.5–3,419 AU once every 70,825 years (semi-major axis of 1712 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.9974 and an inclination of 56° with respect to the ecliptic.
As it has an eccentricity higher than 0.50, the distant object is labelled an (other) unusual object by the Minor Planet Center. The Johnston's Archive groups it to the damocloids, due to its extreme orbital elements and a TJupiter of less than 2, while in JPL's Small Body Database, it is a trans-Neptunian object with a semi-major axis larger than that of Neptune. 
It is by far the most distant and eccentric known asteroid orbiting the Sun, varying in its distance from the Sun over its orbit by 99.89% from slightly within the orbit of Jupiter, to more than 7,000 times Earth's distance to the Sun. While its orbit extends to the inner Oort cloud, it may not be a member of it, as it approaches very near to Saturn, implying Saturn has either captured a past Oort Cloud object onto this orbit, or it was a centaur ejected by Saturn from a much smaller orbit. However, it would be impossible to project its orbit far enough into the past to determine which scenario is true.
Like most objects on an extremely distant orbit around the Sun, 's barycentric orbit is very different from its heliocentric orbit, the latter being based only on the current position of the Solar System barycenter, and the former is based on the long-term movement of the barycenter. While the heliocentric aphelion is 7,000–9,000 AU, depending on the calculation, the current barycentric aphelion (as of 2018) is only 1,700 AU. Before its perihelion in 2016 AD (after that of ~30500 BC), it reached 2,000 AU from the sun around ~14300 BC.
Physical characteristics.
Very little is known for certain about the body's physical characteristics. The Johnston's Archive assumes a generic distant-object albedo of 0.09 and calculates a diameter of 8 kilometers. Like other distant objects, it is probably also fairly red in appearance due to tholins on its surface.

Sartichala

Sartichala ( ) is a village situated in Kvemo Kartli, Eastern Georgia, and is part of the Gardabani Municipality. According to the 2002 population census of Georgia the population of the village amounted to 7041 persons, making it the 5th largest village in the country.
History.
Sartichala as a settlement is first recorded in 1578, by Vakhushti and Ioane Batonishvili. At that time, the village used to be called Satischala ( ).
On September 21, 1818 the first German settlement in the South Caucasus, Marienfeld (near Tbilisi, along the Kakheti highway, now part of Sartichala), was established by a group of Swabian Germans.
Within the next year five more colonies were established, one of them being Petersdorf near Marienfeld which is now part of Sartichala.
From October 1941 to April 1942, most of Georgia's German families, in total 19,186 people, were deported by the Soviet authorities from the republic.
The estimated number of churches in the village is 5:
Geography.
Sartichala is situated along the west bank of the Iori (river), atop the Iori Plateau, and lies at an elevation of 680 meters above sea level. The village is located approximately 34 kilometers east of Georgia's capital, Tbilisi and has the population of 6,009 (2014 census).
The Sartichala oil production plant began working in July 1998, turning out naphtha, diesel and fuel oil. Later on, the Sartichala area of Samgori South Dome oil field was depleted and unfortunately no fields of such scale have been discovered since.
Education.
Sartichala is home to several institutions of primary and secondary education:
"Students: 414"
"Teachers: 38"
"Students: 544"
"Teachers: 57"

Stochastic scheduling

Stochastic scheduling concerns scheduling problems involving random attributes, such as random processing times, random due dates, random weights, and stochastic machine breakdowns. Major applications arise in manufacturing systems, computer systems, communication systems, logistics and transportation, machine learning, etc.
Introduction.
The objective of the stochastic scheduling problems can be regular objectives such as minimizing the total flowtime, the makespan, or the total tardiness cost of missing the due dates; or can be irregular objectives such as minimizing both earliness and tardiness costs of completing the jobs, or the total cost of scheduling tasks under likely arrival of a disastrous event such as a severe typhoon.
The performance of such systems, as evaluated by a regular performance measure or an irregular performance measure, can be significantly affected by the scheduling policy adopted to prioritize over time the access of jobs to resources. The goal of stochastic scheduling is to identify scheduling policies that can optimize the objective.
Stochastic scheduling problems can be classified into three broad types: problems concerning the scheduling of a batch of stochastic jobs, multi-armed bandit problems, and problems concerning the scheduling of queueing systems
. These three types are usually under the assumption that complete information is available in the sense that the probability distributions of the random variables involved are known in advance. When such distributions are not fully specified and there are multiple competing distributions to model the random variables of interest, the problem is referred to as incomplete information. The Bayesian method has been applied to treat stochastic scheduling problems with incomplete information.
Scheduling of a batch of stochastic jobs.
In this class of models, a fixed batch of formula_1 jobs with random process times, whose distributions are known, have to be completed by a set of formula_2 machines to optimize a given performance objective.
The simplest model in this class is the problem of sequencing a set of formula_1 jobs on a single machine to minimize the expected weighted flowtime. Job processing times are independent random variables with a general distribution formula_4 with mean formula_5 for job formula_6. Admissible policies must be nonanticipative (scheduling decisions are based on the system's history up to and including the present time) and nonpreemptive (processing of a job must proceed uninterruptedly to completion once started).
Let formula_7 denote the cost rate incurred per unit time in the system for job formula_6, and let formula_9 denote its random completion time. Let formula_10 denote the class of all admissible policies, and let formula_11 denote expectation under policy formula_12. The problem can be stated as
formula_13
The optimal solution in the special deterministic case is given by the Shortest Weighted Processing Time rule of Smith: sequence jobs in nonincreasing order of the priority index formula_14. The natural extension of Smith's rule is also optimal to the above stochastic model.
In general, the rule that assigns higher priority to jobs with shorter expected processing time is optimal for the flowtime objective under the following assumptions: when all the job processing time distributions are exponential; when all the jobs have a common general processing time distribution with a nondecreasing hazard rate function; and when job processing time distributions are stochastically ordered.
Multi-armed bandit problems.
Multi-armed bandit models form a particular type of optimal resource allocation (usually working with time assignment), in which a number of machines or processors are to be allocated to serve a set of competing projects (termed as arms). In the typical framework, the system consists of a single machine and a set of stochastically independent projects, which will contribute random rewards continuously or at certain discrete time points, when they are served. The objective is to maximize the expected total discounted rewards over all dynamically revisable policies.
The first version of multi-bandit problems was formulated in the area of sequential designs by Robbins (1952). Since then, there had not been any essential progress in two decades, until Gittins and his collaborators made celebrated research achievements in Gittins (1979), Gittins and Jones (1974), Gittins and Glazebrook (1977), and Whittle (1980) under the Markov and semi-Markov settings. In this early model, each arm is modeled by a Markov or semi-Markov process in which the time points of making state transitions are decision epochs. The machine can at each epoch pick an arm to serve with a reward represented as a function of the current state of the arm being processed, and the solution is characterized by allocation indices assigned to each state that depends only on the states of the arms. These indices are therefore known as Gittins indices and the optimal policies are usually called Gittins index policies, due to his reputable contributions.
Soon after the seminal paper of Gittins, the extension to branching bandit problem to model stochastic arrivals (also known as the open bandit or arm acquiring bandit problem) was investigated by Whittle (1981). Other extensions include the models of restless bandit, formulated by Whittle (1988), in which each arm evolves restlessly according to two different mechanisms (idle fashion and busy fashion), and the models with switching costs/delays by Van Oyen et al. (1992), who showed that no index policy is optimal when switching between arms incurs costs/delays.
Scheduling of queueing systems.
Models in this class are concerned with the problems of designing optimal service disciplines in queueing systems, where the jobs to be completed arrive at random epochs over time, instead of being available at the start. The main class of models in this setting is that of multiclass queueing networks (MQNs), widely applied as versatile models of computer communications and manufacturing systems.
The simplest types of MQNs involve scheduling a number of job classes in a single server. Similarly as in the two model categories discussed previously, simple priority-index rules have been shown to be optimal for a variety of such models.
More general MQN models involve features such as changeover times for changing service from one job class to another (Levy and Sidi, 1990), or multiple processing stations, which provide service to corresponding nonoverlapping subsets of job classes. Due to the intractability of such models, researchers have aimed to design relatively simple heuristic policies which achieve a performance close to optimal.
Stochastic scheduling with incomplete information.
The majority of studies on stochastic scheduling models have largely been established based on the assumption of complete information, in the sense that the probability distributions of the random variables involved, such as the processing times and the machine up/downtimes, are completely specified a priori.
However, there are circumstances where the information is only partially available. Examples of scheduling with incomplete information can be found in environmental clean-up, project management, petroleum exploration, sensor scheduling in mobile robots, and cycle time modeling, among many others.
As a result of incomplete information, there may be multiple competing distributions to model the random variables of interest. An effective approach is developed by Cai et al. (2009), to tackle this problem, based on Bayesian information update. It identifies each competing distribution by a realization of a random variable, say formula_15. Initially, formula_15 has a prior distribution based on historical information or assumption (which may be non-informative if no historical information is available). Information on formula_15 may be updated after realizations of the random variables are observed. A key concern in decision making is how to utilize the updated information to refine and enhance the decisions. When the scheduling policy is static in the sense that it does not change over time, optimal sequences are identified to minimize the expected discounted reward and stochastically minimize the number of tardy jobs under a common exponential due date. When the scheduling policy is dynamic in the sense that it can make adjustments during the process based on up-to-date information, posterior Gittins index is developed to find the optimal policy that minimizes the expected discounted reward in the class of dynamic policies.

The 2018 Winter Paralympics medal table is a list of National Paralympic Committees ranked by the number of medals won during the 2018 Winter Paralympics, which were held in PyeongChang, South Korea, in March 2018.
In the standing men's 1.5 kilometre cross-country sprint, two bronze medals were awarded due to a tie.
Host nation South Korea, Croatia and Kazakhstan won their first gold medals at a Winter Paralympics. This also happened with the next Winter Paralympics host nation China also won its first medal, a gold medal, at a Winter Paralympics.
Medal table.
The ranking in the table is based on information provided by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and will be consistent with IPC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table will be ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a "nation" is an entity represented by a National Paralympic Committee [NPC]). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by IPC country code.

Courtney Webb (sportswoman)

Courtney Anne Webb (born 30 November 1999) is a cricketer and Australian rules footballer from Launceston, Tasmania. A right-handed batter and right-arm medium-pace bowler, Webb currently plays for South Australia in the Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) and for the Melbourne Renegades in the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL).
Cricket.
Webb made her WNCL debut for Tasmania in the first match of the 2017–18 season, scoring four runs with the bat and finishing with bowling figures of 2/28 in a seven-wicket loss to Western Australia. Ahead of the 2020–21 season, she declined to re-sign with Tasmania and instead accepted an offer to play for South Australia.
In February 2018, Webb was selected in the under-19 national women's squad, set to tour South Africa during April. She was named vice-captain of the 50-over team which played in a tri-series against South Africa Emerging Women and the England Women's Academy.
Women's Big Bash League.
Webb signed with the Melbourne Renegades ahead of WBBL04. She debuted on 8 December 2018 at the Junction Oval in a six-wicket win against the Adelaide Strikers, though she was not required to bat. Her most significant contribution of the season came on 29 December at Docklands Stadium, when she scored 21 not out and helped the Renegades narrowly defeat the Melbourne Stars with one ball to spare. It was just the second one-wicket victory in the league's history.
The Renegades re-signed Webb ahead of WBBL05. She delivered a breakout performance on 17 November 2019 against the Sydney Sixers at Drummoyne Oval by scoring 34 not out, hitting a six off the final ball to clinch a two-wicket victory and earning Player of the Match honours.
Although her team struggled throughout WBBL06, Webb was again recognised as one of the league's rising stars—an unbeaten innings of 54 runs from 33 balls at Sydney Showground Stadium on 15 November 2020 helped secure a super over victory against the previously undefeated Melbourne Stars, earning her a second nomination for the Young Gun award. Webb's ability in the field also garnered attention, particularly after claiming a spectacular diving catch at North Sydney Oval against the Sydney Sixers which was praised by commentators as one of the best of the tournament. Capping off a strong campaign, she was named the Renegades' Player of the Season.
In June 2021, Webb re-signed with the Renegades for another two seasons.
Football.
Webb played two matches for in the AFL Women's (AFLW) competition. After being passed over in the 2017 national draft, Webb was ultimately drafted by Carlton with their third selection and the 17th overall pick in the rookie draft. She made her debut during round four of the 2018 season in a 73-point loss to the at VU Whitten Oval.
In April 2019, Webb was delisted by Carlton. Despite injuries and the struggle to balance two sports, it was reported she would continue to play football at local level for Launceston and hadn't ruled out attempting to return to AFLW in the future.

Genetics of GnRH deficiency conditions

To date, at least twenty five different genes have been implicated in causing gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency conditions such as Kallmann syndrome (KS) or other forms of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH) through a disruption in the production or activity of GnRH. These genes involved cover all forms of inheritance, and no one gene defect has been shown to be common to all cases, which makes genetic testing and inheritance prediction difficult.
The number of genes known to cause cases of KS/CHH is still increasing. In addition, it is thought that some cases of KS/CHH are caused by two separate gene defects occurring at the same time.
Genes.
A table of known genes responsible for cases of GnRH deficiency conditions is shown below. Listed are the estimated prevalence of cases caused by the specific gene, additional associated symptoms and the form of inheritance. Between 35 and 45% of cases of KS/CHH have an unknown genetic cause.

Lucien de Zoysa

Lucien Edward de Zoysa (1917 – 1995) was a Ceylonese cricketer who played first-class cricket between 1947 and 1954. He became a stage actor, playwright, author, and cricket commentator on radio.
Early life and education.
Lucien de Zoysa was one of seven sons of Sir Francis de Zoysa, a Ceylonese lawyer and statesman. He attended both of Ceylon's two pre-eminent schools: first S. Thomas' College, Mount Lavinia, and then Royal College, Colombo. In March and April 1936 he took part in the first visit to Australia by any cricket team from Asia when he toured with the Royal College team.
Cricket career.
A leg-spin bowler, de Zoysa played club cricket in Colombo with Sinhalese Sports Club. He was the leading wicket-taker when the club made a short tour of three non-first-class matches in India in 1945-46. 
He played his first match for Ceylon in 1946-47, taking six wickets when the Ceylon Cricket Association team defeated a Southern India team in Madras by an innings. In 1949-50 he was easily the most successful bowler when Ceylon toured Pakistan. Ceylon lost three and drew two of the five matches, but de Zoysa took wickets consistently and finished with 21 wickets at an average of 16.23. In the match against Pakistan in Karachi he took 6 for 72 in the first innings, becoming the first Ceylonese player to take six wickets in an innings in an international match. A few days earlier, against the Commander-in-Chief's XI at Rawalpindi, he had taken his best first-class figures of 6 for 65 in the first innings.
In 1950-51 he was one of two Ceylonese cricketers (the other was Stanley Jayasinghe) invited to play for a combined Indian, Pakistani and Ceylonese side against the touring Commonwealth XI in Bombay.
Later career.
De Zoysa's main career was in the theatre. He was an actor and director, and wrote several English-language plays and stories based on the history and legends of Ceylon. He also became a cricket commentator on radio, providing English-language descriptions for many years in partnership with his former Ceylon and Sinhalese Sports Club teammate Bertie Wijesinha.
Personal life.
He and his wife, Dr Manorani Saravanamuttu, had two sons. One, Richard, a journalist and human rights activist, was murdered in 1990. The other son, Michael, was a Sri Lankan cricket administrator who managed some Sri Lankan touring teams; he died in 2019.

1st Strategic Missile Group (France)

The 1st Strategic Missiles Groupment () is a former unit of the Strategic Air Forces of the French Air and Space Force.
History.
The 1st SMG was formed in September 1968 as the land component of the French nuclear triad (together with the Navy's Redoutable-class ballistic nuclear submarines and the Air Force's fleet of Dassault Mirage IV nuclear bombers). The 1st SMG was an army unit armed with 18 S2 strategic nuclear ballistic missiles. It was based on the Plateau d'Albion in the southeast of France. The group reached operational readiness with its S2 missiles on 2 August 1971. The 18 missiles were split in two batteries (of 9 silos each), officially called "firing units" ("unités de tir"), which were formed respectively in 1970 and in 1972. The first battery was taken off duty in April 1978 in anticipation of the replacement of the S2s with the new S3 ballistic missiles; the modernization of the infrastructure for fielding of the new system commenced at the end of that year. The battery received its first S3 missile on 23 May 1980 (three months behind schedule from the timetable set in 1973) and reached operational readiness on 1 June. The two batteries formed the Firing Squadron 01.200 "Luberon" ("l'Escadron de Tir" ("ET") "01.200 "Luberon"")—the operational unit of the French Army's Strategic Missile Brigade 05.200 ("Brigade de Missiles Stratégiques" ("BMS") "05.200"), formed in May 1968. The "Luberon" Firing Squadron changed its designation from 01.200 to 02.394 in 1981. 
In 1985, the land-based ballistic missile component was transferred from the French Army to the French Air Force. Thus, in June that year, the Strategic Missile Brigade 05.200 became the 95th Strategic Missile Wing ("95e Escadre de Missiles Stratégiques" ("EMS 00.095")), the Firing Squadron 02.394 "Luberon" became its Strategic Missile Squadron 01.095 ("Escadron de Missile Stratégique" ("EMS") "01.095"), and the army base became an operational air force installation designated as Air Base 200 Apt-Saint-Christol. The base was protected by the Protection Squadron 21.200 ("l'Escadron de protection" ("EP") "21.200)", a dedicated missile air defence unit armed with Crotale SAMs, a dedicated NBC defence unit and the 04.067 "Durance" Helicopter Squadron ("l'Escadron d'hélicoptères" ("EH") "04.067 Durance") providing perimeter security to the base. Protection Squadron 21.200 consisted of four paratrooper companies and additional support units such as horse-mounted and working dog platoons. It was formed in 1968 and split into two separate squadrons in 1978. 
With the armed forces reduction in Europe after the end of the Cold War and the rapid technological advancements in guided weapon systems, the base's vulnerability increased. As a result, plans for the replacement of the S3 with a land version of the Navy's M5 strategic nuclear ballistic missile system were deemed impractical by the French government. On 22 February 1996 French President Jacques Chirac announced that the S3 missiles would be dismantled and that the Apt-Saint-Christol air base would be closed. 
On 31 August 1998 the 1st Strategic Missile Group and the 04.067 Durance Helicopter Squadron were disbanded. The dismantling of the S3 missiles was completed the following year.

Church of St Peter, Fremington

The Church of St Peter is the Anglican parish church for Fremington, now a suburb of nearby Barnstaple but at one time a separate village. There has been a church on the site since at least 1268 with the present structure mostly dating to the 13th and 15th-centuries. The church comes under the Diocese of Exeter and has been a Grade II* listed building since 1965.
History and design.
It is known that there has been a church on the site since at least 1268 when the first chaplain, Roger, was appointed, and there is substantial evidence of Norman construction following the Norman Conquest of 1066. Built of roughly coursed stone rubble with ashlar dressings, the porch and the bell tower are the oldest parts of the church with their remains of Norman arches dating to the 12th and 13th-centuries. Recessed into the outside wall to the right of the church door is a holy water font or stoup which is pre-Reformation and which would have been used for making the sign of the cross before entering the church. The square tower may originally have had a lead-covered spire, removed for unknown reasons. Between the 13th and 15th-centuries the church was enlarged and embellished so that it now comprises two aisles with two parallel roofs, one smaller than the other and decorated with Perpendicular-style pillars and arches.
In 1813 the ancient pillars and a "rich and elegant" Gothic rood screen were removed and replaced by far less elegant columns. At this time a singing gallery was added at the back of the church in order to accommodate a string band while the window frames with their fine tracery were also removed. However, in 1866 the architect Sir Gilbert Scott was working nearby in Barnstaple on St Peter's church and his services were secured from 1867 to 1868 at St Peter's in Fremington. Scott reversed the earlier "improvements" with the singing gallery being removed and eight new columns being reintroduced decorated with vines, fruit and faces (some grotesque) connected along the length of the church with Gothic-style arches. New arched stone window frames were inserted and some of the old tracey having been found was placed back in its original position. The church was reopened for worship in 1867.
Scott also designed the lychgate which presumably replaced an earlier structure; he incorporated the large rectangular stone traditionally used for resting coffins on into his design. The gates were replaced in the early 21st-century following Scott's original design. 
The wine-glass stone pulpit was unearthed during restoration in the 1860s buried in a mutilated condition beneath the church floor. It is believed to be 15th-century and is decorated with beautifully carved figures of Jesus and the Four Evangelists; it retains some of its original colour but was heavily restored during the 19th-century. The baptismal font dates to 1867 and its fine carvings around the bowl depict Noah's Ark and the dove sent out to find land. Also around the bowl are carved the words of Jesus, "Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God". The church organ with its hand-cranked pianolo roll was originally in a private home but was donated to the church where it was installed in 1907. It has a range of fifty-six notes and was rebuilt in 2002. There is a fragment of a medieval wall painting on the south wall which shows two angels and two towers of the Holy City.
The reredos is of alabaster and Caen stone with the symbols Alpha and Omega (the first and last) carved on either side of the marble cross. The altar table is Elizabethan. Above the main door is a large painted panel depicting the Royal Coat of Arms of Queen Anne which was placed here sometime between 1707 and her death in 1714, as the insignia shown are those of the monarch after the Acts of Union of 1707.
The stained glass is 19th and 20th-century and variously depicts Jesus blessing the Little Children; the Pharisee and the Tax Collector; the Good Shepherd; the Raising of Jairus' Daughter; Jesus as a Fisher of Men; the Resurrection, and the Parable of the Good Samaritan. The bell tower contains a peal of six bells with two medieval bells no longer in use and stored in the bell chamber. The wall monuments and tablets are to Susanna Davie, (d.1694), with its oval medallion swathed with drapery, a scallop and skull to the base and amorini to each side. There is an undated memorial to Richard Slowly with its broken pediment and central achievement. A slate tablet is dedicated to George Bragg of Loveacot (d.1629). There are five diamond-shaped hatchments with painted arms and a large 18th-century wall monument to the Harding family.

Macerata shooting

On 3 February 2018, a right-wing terrorist shooting occurred in Macerata, Italy. It received widespread media coverage and affected Italian politics as it occurred during the political campaign for the 2018 Italian general election.
Events.
On 3 February 2018, in the city of Macerata, Marche, 28-year-old local Luca Traini, driving a black Alfa Romeo 147 and armed with a 9mm Glock 17 Gen3 semi-automatic pistol, seriously wounded, in a drive-by shooting, six African migrants. Traini also targeted the local headquarters of the ruling Italian Democratic Party. After the attack, Traini reportedly had an Italian flag draped on his shoulders and raised his arm in a Fascist salute. 
Traini said the attack was revenge for the murder of Pamela Mastropietro, an 18-year-old local girl whose dismembered body had been found a few days earlier, stuffed into two suitcases and dumped in the countryside. For this, a 29-year-old Nigerian national and failed asylum seeker, Innocent Oseghale, had been arrested and charged. Oseghale had been denied asylum a year previously, but remained in Italy.
Aftermath.
Traini was a member and former local candidate of Lega Nord, and many political commentators, intellectuals and politicians harshly criticized the League's leader Matteo Salvini, accusing him of having spread hate and racism in the country. Particularly, the notable anti-mafia writer Roberto Saviano labeled Salvini as the moral instigator of the attack. Salvini responded to critics by accusing the center-left government of responsibility for Mastropietro's death for allowing migrants to stay in the country and having "blood on their hands", asserting the blame lies with those who "fill us with illegal immigrants". Then Italian Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti harshly condemned the attack, saying that no political party must "ride the hate".
During the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings at Al Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand, Traini's name was written on one of weapon magazines of the perpetrator, Australian Brenton Harrison Tarrant, alongside other far-right mass murderers and killers in addition to historical figures and battles. Tarrant also named Traini as among the shooters and killers that he supported because they "take a stand against ethnic and cultural genocide". Traini dissociated himself from the event, declaring himself to be regretful about what happened in Macerata.
The "Prosecutor's Office of Macerata" formulated against Traini the accusation of massacre aggravated by the purpose of racism, in addition to other crimes, including the abusive port of firearms. On 3 October 2018 Traini was sentenced to 12 years in prison with a summary judgment.
One of Traini's victims, Gideon Azeke of Nigeria, was arrested in September 2018 and convicted of drug dealing in May 2019. He was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in jail, followed by deportation.

Abunasunga

Abunasunga or Abouna Sounga, also known as Lensidede or Lessé Dédé, is a Wayana village on an island in the Lawa River.
History.
The Lawa River forms the border between Suriname and French Guiana, and islands are ambiguous. In 1860, the Ndyuka signed a peace treaty with the Aluku, and allowed them to settle in Abunasunga. The Aluku had chosen French citizenship, and therefore Abunasunga is a French village.
Abunasunga was founded by Wayana chief Kanailu, who left the village of Kawemhakan after a conflict with granman Anapaikë about the influence of the Baptist mission on Wayana life in Kawemhakan. Abunasunga is unique among Wayana villages in that it lies in the territory inhabited by Aluku.

Slosarczykovia

Slosarczykovia is a monotypic genus of squid, its sole representative being Slosarczykovia circumantarctica. "Slosarczykovia" is placed in the family Brachioteuthidae.
"Slosarczykovia circumantarctica" is a relatively large species of squid attaining a mantle length of 170 mm, the mantle having a long and slender form with rhomboid shaped fins placed posteriorly. The suckers on the arms are very variable some completely lacking in teeth, others with few teeth and yet others with many teeth. The tentacles have the largest suckers running from the proximal manus and these are about three quarters in diameter of largest sucker from proximal dactylus. The suckers on the tentacular club are weakly differentiated. There is no carpal locking mechanism and there are 13 small carpal suckers which form a row along the dorsal margin of the manus. In squid with a mantle length of greater than 60mm the mantle, fins, head and arms are covered in a fibrous, net like covering of the integument. There is no hectocotylus on the males.
"Slosarczykovia circumantarctica" was described from a type specimen collected off Wilkes Land, Antarctica and it is thought to have a distribution throughout the seas around Antarctica. It is one of the most common species of squid in Antarctic waters but little is known of the biology of this pelagic species. It is not currently fished for.
The generic name "Slosarczykovia" honours was derived from the surname of the late Dr Wieslaw Slósarczyk, who was responsible for collecting almost all the specimens used to describe the species while the specific name "circumantarctica" refers to the circumpolar distribution of the species in the Southern Ocean.

Xiama

Xiama is a 2000 puzzle adventure game by Townsville-based Australian studio Mulawa Dreaming, released on Windows. The game was self-published by its developer, Peter Hewitt, off his website and at a stall in Townville's "Cotter's Markets".
Development.
Peter Hewitt based the game on a trip he had through a national park, and used the photos he took there as the backdrop of the title. The game, developed solely by Hewitt, took around a year to complete. The title is an acronym. The game was playtested by a young puzzle lover named Penny, and were crafted to allow novices to have a go while challenging long-time puzzlers. Hewitt's favourite puzzle is The Venus Jigsaw. Some of his puzzles, such as the three turtle puzzles, don't require prior knowledge and can be completed with by press buttons and experimenting. Hewitt expected some of the more challenging puzzles to last more than one play session. He found the cave system one of the highlights to develop.
On March 15, 2000, Hewitt developed the concept of the "Xiama" "books" in order to get away from the usual games saving mechanism. The "Xiama" website went live on March 19. On April 24, Bill Basham gave permission for the use of his midi version of Waltzing Matilda. The post-its idea was implemented on May 18, as Hewitt had long wanted to add personal touches to the game. The puzzles were completed on June 1. On June 3, he negotiated a deal with Listening Earth to use their bird calls and dingo howls. On June 4, Bill Basham agreed to his use of "The Rejection" in the project. The game uses the ClickTeam Installation program.
The game had no marketing efforts either for or against women. Hewitt's "personalised and artisanal" web presence invited players ton open and direct dialogue, with items such as a diary detailing the game's development. Hewitt followed up this game with the puzzle adventures "Magnetic" and "Magicama". "Xiama Revisited" was made in 2007 using BlitzBasic 2D, Paintshop Pro 9, Bryce 5, and CoolEdit 2000. It was play tested by Doug Bradley, and dedicated in the memory of Penny Cadwell. At the beginning of 2017 in January, both versions became free.
Plot and gameplay.
The game is set in the North Queensland rainforest Alligator Creek Falls, located at Bowling Green Bay National Park .The player arrives at the park to meet up with their friend Peter for a trek, only to receive a note saying he's gone on ahead. The player proceeds to wander on alone, discovering a rich landscape along the way.
"Xiama" is a first person game primarily in 2D. The player progresses through a series of static screens, and interacts with hotspots to access puzzles. Like its follow-up "Magnetic, Xiama" blends 3D graphics with slideshow-styled photo backdrops. There are 24 puzzles placed within the 100 environments. Completing puzzles will unlock further areas and puzzles, and progressing through the game increases the player's score. The last puzzle is only unlocked after the player completes the other 23. The puzzles are superimposed onto photos of the national park. When the player completes a puzzle, a sticky note is added to their journal which contains some of the player's thoughts and reflections. Puzzles a re-scrambled when the player leaves the area, to enable the revisiting of old puzzles The soundscape consists of bird calls, campfire cracking, stream water, and animal noises; meanwhile, two puzzles revolve around the traditional folk song Waltzing Matilda.
The game is completable within a 24-hour period.
Critical reception.
"MrBillsAdventureland" felt the game reminded them of Jewels of the Oracle, due to its exotic and fascinating setting, and its challenging and addictive gameplay. The site felt, however, that its follow-up, "Magnetic", would have a richer mix of game types and wished both these titles had junior versions for younger players. "Quandary" noted the game was not an adventure in the traditional sense, due to lacking inventory, item collection, and an unfolding story. "Pibweb" noted that the game was not 100% accurate, due to it including a cave scene, when Alligator Creek doesn't have a cave system. "Just Adventure" recommended the game to lovers of puzzles, photography, and nature. "GameZone" appreciated the fact that the game was not run of the mill. "Game Vortex" noted that the game's puzzles vary wildly in difficulty. "Computer Games Online" deemed it a "fiendishly cerebral offering", and felt that the in-game reward for completing the game came off as a "cruel joke". Academic Stephen Granade thought the game's largest deficiencies were in its interface and lack of documentation, and described it as playing like "Myst", only more boring.
"Adventure Gamers" thought the game offered a better experience when played with family and friends. Thanks to the game, GameBoomers looked forward to future projects from Mulawa Dreaming. Mystery Manor felt the game was challenging, particular navigating around the park. BonusWeb forgave the amateurish screens as having a similar charm to the 1995 Czech point-and-click adventure game "Ramonovo Kouzlo" by Vochozka Trading. According to "The Players' Realm", the game is "thoroughly rooted in the lost tradition" of gameplay consisting of progressing through a series of static panoramic screens through puzzle-solving and clue-collecting, as seen in titles such as Myst, Riven, and Jewels of the Oracle, in a genre "so beloved of earlier games scholarship". The book notes that the puzzles turn what would have been a slideshow into narrative architecture, in which the photographs become rewards for the completion of puzzles in the ludic experience.
In addition, "Adventure Gamers" thought that while far from a perfect game, "Xiama" captured the spirit of adventure gaming, and gave it the Best Puzzles of 2000 Award.

Golden Hour (Kacey Musgraves album)

Golden Hour is the fourth studio album by American country music singer and songwriter Kacey Musgraves, released on March 30, 2018, through MCA Nashville. Musgraves co-wrote all 13 tracks and co-produced the album with Daniel Tashian and Ian Fitchuk. A country pop record, "Golden Hour" also contains elements of disco, electropop, electronica, and yacht rock.
"Golden Hour" debuted at number four on the US "Billboard" 200. Receiving widespread critical acclaim, the album and its songs won in all four of their nominated categories at the 61st Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year and Best Country Album. The album's first two singles also won awards: "Butterflies" for Best Country Solo Performance and "Space Cowboy" for Best Country Song. "Golden Hour" also won Album of the Year at the 52nd Annual Country Music Association Awards. In 2020, "Golden Hour" was ranked at 270 on "Rolling Stone"'s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list.
Background and recording.
Musgraves wrote and recorded most of the songs from the album throughout 2017; about the writing process she said, "I have a lot more love songs this time around, and I've never been one to write a love song and really feel it." She continued: "That probably sounds like the most depressing thing ever. [But] I'm coming off getting married and being in this golden hour of my personal life, where all these things are finally coming to fruition. I found myself inspired to write about this person and all these things he brought out in me that weren’t there before." Some of the album was recorded in a studio above a horse stable owned by musician Sheryl Crow.
In a 2019 interview with "Rolling Stone", Musgraves discussed being under the influence of LSD when composing the songs "Mother" and "Slow Burn" and how it helped her creative process; "I’m not going to tell anybody to run out and do anything that wouldn’t be suitable for their mind or their lifestyle, but it did have positive effects for me."
Promotion and packaging.
On March 10, 2018, Musgraves announced the Oh, What a World: Tour in support of the album while performing at the in London. The first 12 dates of the tour were announced on March 12, with Musgraves stating on social media that tour dates in other countries would eventually be added. The tour began on October 13 in Oslo, Norway. Musgraves announced a second leg of the tour, titled the Oh, What a World: Tour II, in February 2019.
Musgraves' sister Kelly Christine Sutton took the cover photo for "Golden Hour" over a two-day photo shoot in and around their hometown of Golden, Texas. Sutton, who also is credited with designing the album's packaging, has previously worked with Musgraves for all of her albums' artwork. Of the cover photo, Sutton recalls Kacey "wanted to use this paper fan, and we are usually on the same page with ideas, but I couldn’t picture it. We went out into this wide open field. We needed one with no trees, so there was sky only. Almost immediately after we reviewed the photos, we just knew we had it."
Critical reception.
"Golden Hour" received widespread acclaim from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 89, based on 17 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated the album four and a half out of five stars and called it "warm and enveloping, pitched halfway between heartbreak and healing—but (it) lingers in the mind because the songs are so sharp, buttressed by long, loping melodies and Musgraves' affectless soul baring." Writing for "The Independent" and rating the album a perfect 5 out of 5, Roisin O'Connor states the album is "a reminder that sometimes – often, if you're looking in the right places – life is beautiful." Additionally, it was a "Spin" "Essential" and of the genre-bending songs on the album, reviewer Katherine St. Asaph calls it "not classicist, but perhaps it might be classic." The album was rated number one by the BBC poll of polls, a compilation of best-of-the-year lists across 35 music reviewers, on a list of the best albums of 2018. The album also placed number one in "The Village Voice"s Pazz &amp; Jop critics' poll for 2018.
Accolades.
At the 61st Annual Grammy Awards in 2019, "Golden Hour" won Album of the Year and Best Country Album. Its songs, "Space Cowboy" and "Butterflies", won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance, respectively.
Commercial performance.
"Golden Hour" debuted at number four on the US "Billboard" 200 and at number one on the Top Country Albums chart with 49,000 album-equivalent units, with 39,000 of that figure being pure album sales in its first week. It marks Musgraves’ third number one on the US Top Country Albums chart. It also debuted at number one on the Americana/Folk Albums chart. In the chart week following the 61st Grammy Awards, where "Golden Hour" won Album of the Year, the album returned to the top ten, climbing to number nine on the chart, selling 35,000 copies.

Crooked Beat Records

Crooked Beat Records, based in Alexandria, Virginia, is an independent record label which puts out music by artists from the Washington, DC area. The Crooked Beat label is affiliated with a record store of the same name. Crooked Beat has produced five seven-inch records and six albums, including tributes to The Clash and Jonathan Richman. Records released by Crooked Beat Records are distributed nationally for Record Store Day.
Label.
Crooked Beat Records and the affiliated store are owned and operated by Bill Daly. Daly previously operated a record label called Crisis Discs in Raleigh, North Carolina, during the 1990s. Daly is also a member of the band Insurgence DC, previously known as Insurgence. Insurgence DC has recorded for both Crisis Discs and Crooked Beat Records.
The first releases from Crooked Beat Records were issued in 2014, and included seven-inch records by Insurgence DC and Möbius Strip. Three additional seven-inch records were released for Record Store Day 2015. Crooked Beat Records produced single LPs in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020; and a double LP in 2018.
The first LP released by Crooked Beat Records, "A Bang on the Ear," included music by Insurgence DC, Möbius Strip, and Don Zientara. The record was released for Record Store Day 2016.
In 2017, Crooked Beat Records issued "Recutting the Crap, Volume One," released for Record Store Day 2017. "Recutting the Crap, Volume One," is a tribute to The Clash, with various US artists performing songs from the Clash album "Cut the Crap," as well as two songs from the B-side of the single This Is England. The record features bands from the DC metropolitan area, and from around the U.S. The Violets, a band from Athens, Georgia, reformed after 25 years of inactivity to record a song for "Recutting the Crap, Volume One." The Violets had been active from 1988 to 1992, and had previously recorded "I Hate The Grateful Dead" for Bill Daly's first label, Crisis Discs. Other artists contributing to "Recutting the Crap, Volume One" included Don Zientara; Too Much Joy, Insurgence DC, Geisha Hit Squad, and The Scotch Bonnets.
For Record Store Day 2018, Crooked Beat Records issued "Recutting the Crap, Volume Two." "Recutting the Crap, Volume Two," like Volume One, features various U.S. artists performing newly recorded versions of songs from The Clash's "Cut The Crap" sessions. Crooked Beat Records also included a bonus record entitled "The Future Was Unwritten," with various artists covering Joe Strummer/Mick Jones compositions written after The Clash broke up.
For Record Store Day 2019, Crooked Beat Records issued "Broken In The Theater of the Absurd," the first full length album by Insurgence DC in 20  years. "Broken In The Theater of the Absurd" includes new 2018 mixes of "Poison Profits" and "Dishonor," originally issued in 2015 on Crooked Beat CB014, and "True To Life," originally issued in 2014 on Crooked Beat CB011.
For the third 2020 Record Store Day Drop on October 24, 2020, Crooked Beat Records issued "Athens, GA 1988-1992," a collection of songs by The Violets. This release includes "I Hate The Grateful Dead," previously released by Crisis Discs. The Violets also previously contributed to the prior Crooked Beat releases "Recutting the Crap," Volumes One and Two.
For the second 2021 Record Store Day Drop on July 17, 2021, Crooked Beat Records released "Songs from The Astral Plane, Volume One: A Tribute to Jonathan Richman &amp; The Modern Lovers." The album included contributions from The Violets, The Scotch Bonnets, Wonderlick, and the North Carolina band Finger. The track from Finger was the band's first new recording in over twenty-five years.
Tim Hinely of "Blurt Online" praised Crooked Beat's first release, "True To Life / Man in Black" by Insurgence DC, citing its "rabble-rousing anthemism." The music website "Divide And Conquer" described Indiobravo's debut release for Crooked Beat, "Breakdown / Crawl Back," as sounding "live, raw and unprocessed."
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described "Recutting The Crap, Volume One" as "a collector's delight of various artists' versions of songs from The Clash." Steve Shafer of "Duff Guide to Ska" favorably reviewed "Recutting The Crap, Volume One," saying that "The Scotch Bonnets' terrific, stripped-down reggae take on...'Are You Red...Y' alone is worth the cost of this LP." In a subsequent review, Shafer described "Recutting The Crap, Volume Two," as "largely succeed[ing] in redeeming Strummer's Clash II legacy." Shafer described Insurgence DC's version of "This Is England" as "a truly great Clash song made even better here."
On July 31, 2021, the Jonathan Richman tribute album "Songs from The Astral Plane, Vol. 1" entered the Billboard Compilation Album charts at #23.
On June 29, 2019, Crooked Beat Records participated in a "D.C. Music Preservation Pop-Up" held as part of the 2019 Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Crooked Beat was one of a number of independent record labels from the Washington, D.C. area to appear at a Smithsonian-sponsored Local Record Market.
Store.
Daly founded a record store called Crooked Beat Records in 1997 in Raleigh, N.C. In 2004, Crooked Beat Records moved to 18th Street in the Adams Morgan section of Washington, D.C. From 2004 until 2006, the Adams Morgan store was operated by Bill Daly and Neal Becton as a shared retail space. In 2006, Becton left and opened Som Records, a competing record store still operating in Washington D.C. Crooked Beat Records remained in Washington for twelve years, until moving to Alexandria, Virginia, in 2016. Before moving to Alexandria, Crooked Beat Records was named one of the best record stores in the Washington, D.C., area in 2015. Since moving to Alexandria, the business organization Visit Alexandria named Crooked Beat Records in a list of "11 Shops That Are Worth The Trip In Old Town Alexandria."
In 1997, when Crooked Beat Records opened in Raleigh, N.C., approximately 30% of sales came from vinyl records. By 2011, vinyl records accounted for "99 percent of total sales," according to Daly. In 2011, Crooked Beat Records ceased sales of CDs, except for albums by local artists. Crooked Beat Records specializes in sales of both new and used vinyl.

This Diamond Ring (album)

This Diamond Ring is the debut studio album by American band Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, and was released in 1965 on Liberty Records, LRP-3408. It is the first of three charting albums released by the band in 1965.
Background.
The group was formed in 1964 and was originally known as Gary &amp; the Playboys. Producer Snuff Garrett saw them performing at Disneyland and he brought them into the studio to record the single "This Diamond Ring". He also had the band change their name to Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys to capitalize on Gary's famous father, comedian/actor Jerry Lewis. The success of the single led them to record a whole album of mostly covers of popular songs by the Kinks, Bobby Rydell, the Coasters, and others. The album was the second highest charting original album of their career. The single "This Diamond Ring" launched a string of seven Top 10 hits for the group.
The album is somewhat notable in that it marked the beginning of long successful careers for musicians Al Kooper and Leon Russell.
Dispute regarding musicians on the album.
Over the years, there has been much discussion regarding the roles of various musicians used on the album sessions. Garrett used The Wrecking Crew as session players on the whole album. Lewis has stated in interviews: Producer Garrett remembers it differently, stating: There is also a question regarding whether Carol Kaye contributed bass on some tracks.

Robert M. Epstein

Robert Marvin Epstein (born March 10, 1928) is an American anesthesiologist, a member of the National Academy of Medicine, and the Harold Carron Professor of Anesthesiology ("emeritus") at the University of Virginia.
Early life and education.
Epstein was born in the Bronx, New York on March 10, 1928, the son of immigrants from Slonim, in present-day Belarus. He attended primary school in the Bronx, and completed his secondary education in Miami Beach, Florida where the family moved in 1940. From there he attended the University of Michigan from 1944 to 1951, where he obtained both his bachelor's and MD degrees. Epstein served as an attending anesthesiologist with a rank of 1st Lieutenant in the US Army Medical Corps, and was stationed first in Korea and later in Japan.
Columbia University.
Epstein underwent residency training at Columbia University in the department chaired by Emanuel Papper, and subsequently joined the Columbia faculty.
He developed an early interest in the causes and prevention of avoidable death due to anesthesia, and was an advocate for the mandatory implementation of specific improvements in anesthesia machines and for the analysis of adverse critical incidents. The technical improvements were designed to prevent the inadvertent administration of oxygen-deficient mixtures of anesthetic gases. Although the hazards of such mixtures had been appreciated since the 1940s, the work published by Epstein and coauthors in 1962 represents the first oxygen "fail safe" apparatus proposed for inhalation anesthesia. The first oxygen "fail safe" device to be custom built and employed in clinical practice following these principles is on display at the Wood Library-Museum. He was the first to predict and establish mutual effects of multiple gas interactions on rates of anesthetic uptake, the "second gas effect."
University of Virginia.
Epstein became the chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at the University of Virginia in 1972, and led the department for 24 years. In honor of his service to the department, an endowed chair was created, the Robert M. Epstein Professorship in Anesthesiology. During his tenure as chairman at UVa, he was instrumental to the establishment (and served as president) of the University of Virginia Health Services Foundation, an organization devoted to strengthening the medical faculty

Biswanath Sardar

Biswanath Sardar (? - 1808) was a leader of the Indigo revolt in the Bengal. He was "Bagdi" by caste, popularly known as "Bishe Dakaat".
Revolt.
The first phase of revolts in Eastern British India started in the early part of the nineteenth century. Biswanath Sardar led the rebellion in Jessore, Nadia and 24 Parganas. The indigo planters forced the peasants to plant indigo instead of food crops. They provided loans, called "dadon", at a very high interest. Subsequently the farmer remained in debt for his whole life before passing it to his successors. The price paid by the planters was meager, only 2.5% of the market price. Sardar organized the Peasant movement, made first notable resistance against the atrocities of "Nil Kar" (Indigo planters) and started looting the estate of planters one by one. He did not even spare the residence and factory of Indigo planters. First he attacked in Santipur "Nilkuthi", afterwards robbed numbers of "Kuthi"s in Khalboalia, Shikarpore, Banshberia, Nischintapur villages. At midnight on 27 September 1808 the peasant rebels surrounded the estate of Samuel Faddy, a planter. Sardar set fire and destroyed the estate but freed Faddy. This incident terrorized all the indigo planters and police sought to arrest Sardar.
Death.
A few months after the attack on Faddy's residence, Police head Mr. Eliot and Mr. Blaquiere, the District Magistrate of Nadia arrested Sardar. He was hanged in Assannagar village after a trial. The police declared him an outlaw but he had a Robin Hood like heroic image to the poor farmers. Sardar was known as "Babu" Biswanath as well as the first martyr of Indigo revolt in India.
Popular culture.
There are numerous tales of his actions. Bengali writer Khagendranath Mitra wrote lot of stories of Bishe Dakait (Decoit). Dhirendralal Dhar portrayed him as great revolutionary in his book "Nilkar Elo Deshe".

2018 Swiss referendums

Ten national referendums were held in Switzerland in 2018. Polling took place on 4 March, 10 June, 23 September and 25 November.
March referendums.
Two referendums were held on 4 March. One was on a Federal Decree on the new Financial Regulation 2021, which would extend the right of the federal government to levy VAT and direct federal tax until 2035; this was approved by 84% of voters. The other was the "Yes to the abolition of radio and television fees" popular initiative, which proposed abolishing the licence fee that provides the majority of funding for the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation. The proposal was rejected by the Federal Assembly in 2017, and by 72% of voters in the referendum.
June referendums.
Two referendums were held on 10 June; one on the Sovereign Money Initiative proposal and one on the Federal Gambling Act.
The Sovereign Money Initiative proposal aims to give the Swiss National Bank a monopoly on money creation. It was launched by the Monetary Modernisation Association, without the support of any political party. The collection of signatures began on 3 June 2014, and the initiative was submitted to the Federal Chancellery on 1 December 2015 with over 110,000 valid signatures, despite its technical subject and without the support of political parties or other civil society organizations. The Federal Assembly recommended rejecting the initiative.
September referendums.
Three referendums were held on 23 September. The first was aimed at requiring the federal government to consider cycle paths in the same way as footpaths and hiking trails, the second would require the government to promote environmentally sound, animal-friendly and fairly produced foodstuffs, and the third to focus agriculture policy on small, family farms and to promote sustainable, diverse and gene-technology-free agriculture. The cycle paths initiative was approved, whilst the food and agriculture ones were rejected.
November referendums.
Three referendums were held on 25 November. The first proposal aimed to subsidise farmers who did not dehorn their livestock. The second proposal would have explicitly given the Swiss Federal Constitution precedence over international law whenever the two contradict. The third initiative would allow insurance companies to hire their own detectives to spy on individuals suspected of abusing social welfare privileges.

2019 Swiss federal election

Federal elections were held in Switzerland on 20 October 2019 to elect all members of both houses of the Federal Assembly. This was followed by the 2019 election to the Swiss Federal Council, the federal executive, by the United Federal Assembly.
In the 20 October elections, the two green parties, the Green Party of Switzerland and the Green Liberal Party of Switzerland, made major electoral gains, taking 13.2% and 7.8% of the vote respectively. As in the previous election, the Swiss People's Party received the most votes, but its share of votes went down to 25.6% from 29.4%.
Initial media coverage interprets the 2019 election results as a "green wave" marking a leftward shift of the Swiss electorate on the political spectrum. It remains to be seen what effect the changes in the relative vote and seat shares will have on the composition of the Federal Council, or at least on the government's agenda and legislative initiatives, if there is no change in party representation in the executive branch.
In contrast to Germany and Austria, the Swiss federal government has for decades been composed of representatives of the four largest parties as a matter of political practice (rather than constitutional design); it has long operated on a consensus-seeking model characterised by accommodation of competing interest and viewpoints, rather than imposition of the will of the majority over the opposition.
Switzerland's confederate structure and frequent initiatives and referendums pose additional constraints on what elected politicians are collectively able to accomplish. For these reasons, the strong electoral gains of the two green parties do not have the same implications for coalition-government formation as they do in Austria following the 29 September 2019 parliamentary elections there, in which the Greens obtained their best results ever with 13.9% of the vote and 26 seats in a slightly smaller lower house of Parliament.
Date.
The elections for the National Council took place nationally on 20 October 2019.
The cantons individually organise their elections for the Council of States, which all held on 20 October 2019, with one exception. In Appenzell Innerrhoden the election took place on 28 April at the 2019 Landsgemeinde. Depending on the results of the 20 October election, a second round or runoff election may be required in some cantons.
Electoral system.
The 200 members of the National Council are elected from 26 cantons, each of which constitutes a constituency. The cantons are of unequal population size and use different electoral systems. Six are single-member constituencies in which winners are determined by first-past-the-post voting; the remaining 20 cantons are multi-member constituencies, in which members are elected by open list proportional representation. Voters may cross out names on party lists, split their vote between parties (a system known as panachage), or draw up their own list on a blank ballot. Seats are allocated using the Hagenbach-Bischoff system.
National Council seats are apportioned to the cantons based on their respective population size (which includes children and resident foreigners who do not have the right to vote). Based on the official population count recorded at the end of 2016, Bern and Lucerne each lost a seat while Geneva and Vaud each gained a seat. The least-populous cantons have just one seat in the National Council — in 2019 there are six such cantons, four of which are half-cantons.
The rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in elections to the National Council are uniform across the Confederation. Only Swiss citizens aged at least 18 can stand or vote and the citizens resident abroad can register to vote in the canton in which they last resided (or their canton of citizenship, otherwise) and be able to vote no matter how long since, or whether they ever have, lived in Switzerland.
The 46 members of the Council of States are elected in 20 two-seat constituencies (representing the 20 'full' cantons) and six single-member constituencies (representing the six half-cantons). Two 'full' cantons with small populations — Uri and Glarus — have therefore each two seats in the Council of States but only one seat each in the much larger National Council. In Jura and Neuchâtel the elections are held using proportional representation, whilst the other 24 use the majority system.
As each canton regulates its election to the Council of States, the rules regarding who can stand as a candidate and vote in these elections varies canton-by-canton. Jura and Neuchâtel allow certain foreign residents to vote, whilst Glarus allows 16- and 17-year-olds the vote. Swiss citizens abroad registered to vote in a canton are permitted to vote in that canton's Council of States election only if the canton's law allows it. Schaffhausen has compulsory voting, though limited in implementation by way of only an insignificant fine.

2018 Rwandan parliamentary election

Parliamentary elections were held in Rwanda on 3 September 2018, with Rwandan overseas voting the day before. The result was a victory for the Rwandan Patriotic Front coalition, which won 40 of the 53 elected seats while losing its absolute majority over the total of seats, whilst the Democratic Green Party and Social Party Imberakuri both entered parliament for the first time.

James Stanhope (MP)

James Banks Stanhope (13 May 1821 – 18 January 1904) was a British Conservative Party politician.
Family.
Stanhope was the son of former MP and British Army officer James Hamilton Stanhope and Lady Frederica-Louisa Murray, daughter of David William Murray, 3rd Earl of Mansfield.
Revesby Abbey.
Stanhope inherited Revesby Abbey in 1823 from his father but did not succeed to the estate until 1842, however, as he was a minor. By the time he succeeded to the estate, it had fallen into disrepair and had been emptied.
In 1843, he commissioned Scottish architect William Burn to redesign the new abbey in a mixture of Jacobean and Elizabethan, also known as Jacobethan. The building was demolished in 1844, with its materials sold at auction, to make way for the abbey's third incarnation.
During this period, new screen gates and a lodge were added on the south boundary. The estate was then completed in 1846 and, following financial losses from the Great Depression of British Agriculture, the estate was passed to Stanhope's elected heir, Edward Stanhope.
Political career.
He was elected MP for North Lincolnshire in 1852 and held the seat until he stood down in 1868.

In 2011 Lovitz joined Logo TV as an on-air interviewer for LGBT issues, as well as one of the hosts of Setup Squad.
Lovitz's public profile as an LGBT advocate was raised in 2011 when he refused to serve on a New York City jury, citing the lack of equal protections and marriage equality for LGBT citizens in the state. This led to multiple appearances on MSNBC and NPR that year.
Lovitz joined the National LGBT Chamber of Commerce in 2015 as Vice President of External Affairs and Director of nglccNY; he has served as Senior Vice President since 2016. At the NGLCC, Lovitz oversees media relations and public policy initiatives focused on the LGBT business community.

In 2018, "Business Equality Magazine" named Lovitz one of its "40 LGBTQ Leaders Under 40" for his contributions to the LGBT rights movement. He was named to the 40 Under 40 list by the Philadelphia Business Journal in April 2019. The Advocate Magazine named Lovitz one of their 2019 Queer Icons in August 2019. 
Lovitz served on the Red Tape Commission for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer; and is a pro-bono consultant focused on inclusion initiatives for the Gay Officers Action League (GOAL) of the NYPD, who honored Lovitz with the Sam Ciccone Community Service Award in April 2018.

The coverage of the PhillyVoting project in major Philadelphia news outlets, including NBC10 Philadelphia, 6ABC Action News, and Philadelphia Gay News, resulted in over 300 new registered voters in the program's first month.
Political career.
On April 2021, Lovitz announced his candidacy for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in the182nd district, representing Center City Philadelphia.
Personal.
Lovitz was born in Atlantic City, NJ and grew up in Coral Springs, Florida. He came out at the age of 16 after being involved heavily in local youth theatre and volunteer organizations. He studied theatre at the summer arts conservatory Stagedoor Manor.

Edmundo Pedro

Edmundo Pedro (8 November 1918 – 27 January 2018) was a Portuguese politician and antifascist, as well as the founder and former leader of the Socialist Party (PS). An opponent of António de Oliveira Salazar's Estado Novo regime and political prisoner during the 1930s and 1940s, Pedro later served as a member of the Assembly of the Republic's I, III and V legislatures (1976–1980, 1983–1985, 1987–1991) following the end of Salazar's regime.
Biography.
Pedro was born in the freguesia of Samouco in the municipality of Alcochete, Portugal, on 8 November 1918. In 1934, Pedro, who was 15-years old, was arrested for the first time for participating in a general strike. He joined the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) later in the 1930s, where he met the party's leader, Álvaro Cunhal. In 1936, Edmundo Pedro was arrested again and sent to the Tarrafal prison camp in Cape Verde alongside his father, Gabriel Pedro, another opponent of the Salazar government.
In 1945, while still in prison, Pedro broke with the PCP and left the party. He was released from Tarrafal in 1946 and returned to mainland Portugal.
In 1973, Edmundo Pedro became one of the co-founders of the Socialist Party (PS) alongside Mário Soares. Following the Carnation Revolution, Pedro became an elected deputy in the national Assembly of the Republic.

Lubentius

Lubentius (c. 300 – c. 370) is a Christian saint, venerated by the Catholic Church. A patron saint of the boatmen on the River Lahn, his feast day is 13 October.
Life.
Lubentius was given by his parents when a small child, to Martin of Tours, who baptized him and treated him as a son. Martin later sent him to Bishop Maximin of Trier to be educated for the priesthood. When Lubentius came of canonical age, Maximin ordained him priest.
He worked as a parish priest in Kobern. In 349, Maximin died while visiting relatives in Acquitaine. His successor, Paulinus of Trier, sent Lubentius to retrieve the body. Lubentius traveled to Acquitaine, and after diligent search, discovered the church where Maximin's body lay. One night, he and his companions, stole the keys to the church from the sleeping custodian, and made off with the body, bringing it back to Trier. 
According to the "Gesta Treverorum" from the 12th century, he worked as a missionary along the Lahn river and founded a church at Dietkirchen. He died in Kobern.
Veneration.
After he died, the people would have place his body in the local church but found that, try as they might, the body could not be moved. A reverend individual suggested placing the corpse in a boat and letting it float up or down the Moselle and choose its own burial site. When the boat reached the Rhine, instead of continuing downstream, if floated up the Lahn all the way to Dietkirchen. (A somewhat similar tale is told of Emmeram of Regensburg.) Baring-Gould describes this as a romantic legend that took the place of a probably very prosaic translation of relics. The remains of the saint were likely moved from Kobern, where he had died, to Dietkirchen some time before 841. His relics are at St. Lubentius, Dietkirchen, now part of Limburg an der Lahn. More relics are venerated in Kell, at , Lahnstein, Limburg and Trier.
Patronage.
Saint Lubentius is a patron saint of the boatmen on the Lahn. His feast day is 13 October.

2018 Malagasy presidential election

Presidential elections were held in Madagascar on 7 November. As no candidate received a majority of the vote, a second round involving the top two candidates, Andry Rajoelina and Marc Ravalomanana, was held on 19 December. On 27 December Rajoelina was announced as the winner with 56% of the vote.
Electoral system.
The President of Madagascar is elected using the two-round system; if no candidate receives a majority of the vote in the first round, a run-off will be held.
Presidential candidates.
Former President Marc Ravalomanana, who resigned following a political crisis in 2009, announced that he would run again for the presidency. His successor, Andry Rajoelina, also announced his intention to contest the elections. Incumbent Hery Rajaonarimampianina unsuccessfully sought to block Ravaolmanana and Rajoelina from running on grounds that they had participated in the 2009 coup d'état. In September 2018, Rajaonarimampianina stepped down to run for reelection, allowing a caretaker government to administer the vote, in accordance with the constitution.
There were a record 36 candidates in the race (surpassing the previous record of 33), including four of the five most recent presidents. However, only five candidates were women, seen by some of illustrating the historic patriarchal dominance of Malagasy politics and culture.
Campaign.
Despite the majority of Malagasy people living in poverty, the elections are expected to be one of the most expensive per capita in 2018. The top three candidates; Hery Rajaonarimampianina, Andry Rajoelina, and Marc Ravalomanana are at a significant financial advantage over the other contenders, with candidate Ny Rado Rafalimanana complaining that due to financial constraints it was impossible for any other candidate to compete with the top three, as there are no campaign finance limits. Some election observers believe that the winner of the election will have more to do with that candidate's financial power and influence than their political positions. The lavish spending on the election has also been criticized due to the large amount of poverty in the country, with many believing the money could be better spent elsewhere.
Although two-thirds of the population is under 25, turnout and interest among young people is low.

In 2008 he won the 100 m at the English Schools' Athletics Championships as well as a 100/200 m double at the national under-17 championships.
Tobais earned his first international selection at the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games, coming fourth in the 100 m final. At the 2010 World Junior Championships in Athletics, he reached the semi-finals. The following year he ran in the heats for the 4 × 100 metres relay team, where Andrew Robertson, Kieran Showler-Davis, Richard Kilty and Danny Talbot took the silver in the final. The 2012 season brought him new personal bests of 10.29 for the 100 m and 20.61 seconds for the 200 m. He maintained this form into 2013 and he came away with two medals at the 2013 European Athletics U23 Championships, taking 100 m silver behind Adam Gemili, before teaming up with his compatriot to set a European under-23 record of 38.77 seconds.
A personal best of 10.18 seconds was the highlight of his 2014 season. He was fifth at the British Athletics Championships that year. His performances dropped thereafter and he failed to make the national 100 m final in the next three seasons.

Witchhunt Suite for WWIII

"Witchhunt Suite for WWIII" is a song by Ariel Pink's Haunted Graffiti, originally released as the final track on the 2007 album "Yas Dudette". In 2011, a rerecorded version was released as a standalone digital single to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the September 11 attacks. Pink and Animal Charm directed the song's music video, which features a cameo appearance from R. Stevie Moore.
Critical reception.
"Pitchfork" reviewer Marc Masters awarded the single a 7.8 out of 10, elaborating "It's all pretty fun, both as postmodern patchwork and nostalgia trip. But, at least at first, the only point seems to be the thrill of randomly tossing historically-charged words and images against the wall. ... its length allows Pink to stretch good ideas into better ones, moving from tight jamming to slow keyboard meditations to freaked-out climaxes. Still, you'd hope there'd be more to a 9/11 concept piece than awesome tuneage."

Nathan Crawford Barnett

Nathan Crawford Barnett (June 28, 1801 - February 2, 1890) was a state legislator and long serving Secretary of State in the U.S. State of Georgia. He is remembered as the man who twice saved the Great Seal of the State of Georgia.
Early life.
Barnett was born in Columbia County, Georgia in 1801 to William Barnett and Ann Crawford Barnett. His father died while Barnett was still quite young, and his widowed mother moved the family to Lexington in Oglethorpe County where he received his education at the Lexington Academy. Barnett married Margaret J. Morton of Clarke County and the couple established a home in Watkinsville, which was the county seat at that time.
Barnett engaged in "planting and merchandising", and in 1832 he was elected Surveyor, and assisted in surveying the Cherokee Purchase in the area of present day Roswell, Georgia in preparation for the sixth state administrated land lottery. It was during this time that he was also elected to the position of major in the Georgia Militia. He was subsequently promoted to the rank of colonel, and in that capacity assisted in the Cherokee Removal from Georgia. Col. Barnett's first wife died in 1840, and he remarried shortly thereafter to Mary Ann Cooper.
Political career.
Georgia House of Representatives.
In 1836 Col. Barnett was elected to the Georgia House of Representatives. Of the legislative initiatives which he sponsored or supported, during this period, the most notable was one which authorized construction of the Western and Atlantic Railroad. That government-owned railroad was established on December 21, 1836. The city of Atlanta was founded as the end of the W&amp;A, with the terminus marked with the Atlanta Zero Mile Post. The line is still owned by the State of Georgia from Atlanta to CT Tower in Chattanooga. After two terms in the House, Barnett declined to run for re-election, after the illness and death of his first wife in 1840.
Secretary of State.
In 1843, Barnett was elected (by the Georgia State Senate) to the position of Georgia Secretary of State, a position he held for three terms until 1849. He was subsequently elected to another, single, term in 1851. He was again elected to the position for the period 1861-1868, but was removed by the Military Governor at the onset of the Reconstruction era. It is said that Barnett twice saved the Great Seal of the State of Georgia. The first time was when Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman were about to capture the State Capitol at Milledgeville. Barnett took the seal, and numerous official documents and Acts, and with the assistance of his wife Mary, buried them at his farm. After Sherman's troops marched on, Barnett returned the seal and the documents to the state. In 1866 Barnett again removed the Great Seal from the capitol. General Ruger, who was at that time acting as the Military Governor of Georgia, requested that Barnett affix the seal to an executive act, which Colonel Barnett could not approve. "He refused to sanction the papers with the imprint of the seal and as a consequence was removed by General Ruger." Colonel Barnett then took the seal with him to prevent it from falling into the hands of what was considered an illegitimate Carpetbagger government which occupied the state: "so that it was never affixed to any of the documents of misrule which followed under the carpetbag government". Since the seal was required, to certify official acts of the state government, the Reconstruction government fabricated a replacement. That replacement was identical in all respects except one. The soldier depicted on the replacement seal held his sword in the wrong hand. The period of the Reconstruction government in Georgia is thus referred to as the "Period of the False Seal". The Great Seal and documents were buried on Barnett's farm, and remained hidden there until 1868, when a new state constitution was enacted and a new government installed. After democrats regained control of state government, Barnett was again elected Secretary of State in 1873. Upon his return to office, both houses of the Legislature voted to present him with a replica of the Executive Seal, which replica is now in Savannah, Georgia, the property of the Georgia Historical Society. Barnett continued to serve as Secretary of State until his death on 2 February 1890. Toward the end of his more than 30 years of service as secretary of state under numerous administrations and into his late 80s, he was said to wear a row of three pairs of glasses. A portrait of Barnett hangs in the office of the Georgia Secretary of State to this day.
Death and legacy.
Nathan Crawford Barnett, who was reported to be "tall and thin" in his youth, at 6'6" in height, died at the age of 89. Only three of Nathan and Mary Barnett's eight children survived into adulthood. Barnett was remembered as a life-long Methodist. The Georgia Capitol (relocated to Atlanta in 1868) was closed February 4, 1890, the day of Colonel Barnett's funeral, held at Milledgeville. "The Central Railroad tendered free use of its cars for Colonel Barnett's family and members of the funeral party." Mary A. Barnett died in Atlanta on January 11, 1902, at the age of 82. She was buried in Milledgeville.

Miscanti Lake

Miscanti Lake (Spanish: "Laguna Miscanti") is a brackish water lake located in the altiplano of the Antofagasta Region, in northern Chile. Miñiques volcano and Cerro Miscanti tower over this lake. This heart-shaped lake has a deep blue color. The western shoreline of the lake is separated by less than 1 km from the drainage divide between the lake and the Salar de Atacama basins. Laguna Miscanti basin also has a common boundary with Salar de Talar basin.
A lava flow from an eruption of Miñiques separated Miscanti Lake from Miñiques Lake.
The lake is part of one of the seven sectors of Los Flamencos National Reserve.
Geography.
Laguna Miscanti lies in the Central Andes of Chile, southeast of the Salar de Atacama. The closest town is Socaire, away from the lake. In 2015, one in three tourists who went to the Los Flamencos National Reserve visited Miscanti and Laguna Miñiques.
Hydrography and geology.
It is a maximally deep lake with clear brackish water which covers a surface area of ; the lake has the shape of an arrowhead with a peninsula jutting from the northern shore. The lake has a flat lakefloor that is subdivided into two basins by a lava flow. In the Atacama Altiplano, Laguna Miscanti is among the biggest waterbodies. The mountains Cerro Miscanti () and Cerro Miniques () lie northeast and south of the lake, respectively.
 south of the lake lies another waterbody, Laguna Miniques. In the past, the two lakes were connected, producing a large waterbody which has left beach terraces in the landscape and whose water levels were about higher than today. The separation of the lakes probably occurred during the Pleistocene, when a lava flow erupted from Cerro Miniques split the lake basin in two. A number of creeks enter into Laguna Miscanti from the north, east and south (Quebrada de Chaquisoqui), and two springs can be found on its northern shores.
Miscanti and Miniques occupy fault-bound basins, which are controlled by the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; the fault is also known as the Miscanti Fault and is part of a detachment fault system east of the Salar de Atacama, which separates the Western Cordillera from the Cordillera Domeyko. This fault extends from the Purico complex, Llano de Chajnantor to Cerro Miniques and has formed a ridge, which has dammed lava flows from Cerro Miscanti and Cerro Miniques. The basins developed during the Pliocene and Pleistocene; Laguna Lejia also developed along this fault and the fault segment there is also known as Miscanti-Callejon de Varela fault. Volcanoes including Lascar are constructed on this fault, and the Cerros Saltar and Corona north and south of Lascar are lined up on it as well.
Hydrology.
The catchment of the lake consists mainly of volcanic and sedimentary rocks ranging from Miocene to Holocene age and covers a surface area of , with Quaternary volcanoes that reach elevations of . The Cordon de Puntas Negras is the principal source of water. Water reaches Laguna Miscanti principally as groundwater, which is directed there by the fault; this may explain why Laguna Miscanti is a permanent lake rather than a playa.
The lake has no surface outflow. Presently, water seeps to Miniques through a lava flow along the path of the Quebrada Nacimiento fault; during former lake highstands a combined lake overflowed into the Pampa Varela basin south-southwest of Miniques. The main removal mechanism of water from Laguna Miscanti however is evaporation. Some water is diverted from the catchment and forms a water supply to the town of Peine.
Climate.
Presently, the regional climate is arid (average precipitation ) and cold (average annual temperature ), leading to the development of ice on the lake surface during winter. The lake area is usually a little warmer than the surrounding region. The region lies between areas dominated by summer precipitation in the northeast and areas dominated by winter precipitation in the southwest.
In the late Pleistocene and early Holocene the climate was much wetter and lakes expanded, while the middle Holocene was dry as was the last glacial maximum and the Central Andean Pluvial Event (especially its first stage). The late Pleistocene-early Holocene wet period was particularly noticeable in the Altiplano, where two separate phases of the Lake Tauca occurred. During the middle Holocene dry period, the lake may have dried up completely forming a bog, while after about 4,000 years ago moisture availability increased again. Climate variability influenced human settlement in the region during the Holocene, which took place mainly during wetter periods and became concentrated in several environmentally favourable spaces during dry periods. An archeological site called "Miscanti-1" is found on the southeastern lake shore.
Biology.
Widgeonweed grows at the lakeshores. Charophytes, "Chara" and "Myriophyllum" are two further aquatic plants that have been identified in the lake. During its highstands, algal bioherms and stromatolithes developed in the water. Diatoms and ostracodes have been identified in the lake sediments, and amphipods have been found in the lake waters.
Meadows consisting of "Fabiana", "Festuca" and "Stipa chrysophylla" grow around the lake, with sparser vegetation found on the upland, consisting of "Baccharis" species also known as "tolar" and ichu. Fauna that inhabits the area includes birds like flamingos, horned coot, rhea and speckled teal, and mammals like the vicuña. Laguna Miscanti and Laguna Miniques are part of the third sector of the Los Flamencos National Reserve.

Francis E. Dumas

Francis Ernest Dumas (1837 – March 26, 1901) was a wealthy plantation owner and slaveholder of Louisiana. He was of African American and creole heritage and served as an officer in the Union Army during the American Civil War.
Biography.
Francis E. Dumas, born in 1837, was the son of plantation owner Joseph Dumas and was an octoroon from his mother's side. He spoke five languages and had lived in France for some time, inheriting the sugar plantation upon his return. There was no simple way for him to free his slaves under Louisiana state law.
When the civil war began Dumas freed over 100 of his slaves and enlisted them as a company in the Union Army. He accordingly was commissioned as Captain of Company B of the 1st Louisiana Native Guards and received a promotion to Major in the 2nd Louisiana Native Guards, one of the highest ranks achieved by an African American during the war. He saw combat in the western theater and resigned his commission over disputes on July 3, 1863.
He was a candidate for Lieutenant Governor in 1868 on the James G. Taliaferro ticket backed by publisher Louis Charles Roudanez. He turned down a nomination to be Louisiana's Republican Party nominee for Lieutenant Governor after losing the nomination for governor to Henry C. Warmoth by a few votes on the second ballot after leading the first. Dumas was chosen by President Grant as minister to Liberia in 1869 but turned it down.
Dumas was initially a candidate for Louisiana Secretary of State on the 1872 Liberal Party Ticket, headed by D.B. Penn for Governor. However, he left the ticket by September 1 before the election when John McEnery became the new candidate for governor, and D.B. Penn took the Lt. Governor spot. Dumas was replaced by another black man, Samuel Armstead.

Torrewa

Torrewa () is a townland in the 
civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Torrewa is bounded on the west by Drumlaydan townland and on the east by Bellaleenan and Culliagh townlands. Its chief geographical feature is a spring well. Torrewa is traversed by minor roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 22 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Torrewa was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
The 1836 Ordnance Survey Namebooks state- "There is the remains of an old Danish fort on the eastern boundary of the townland and one middling farm house near the centre."
The Torrewa Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 15, being 9 males and 6 females. There were two houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 7, being 3 males and 4 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There was one house in the townland and it was inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists six landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 7, being 2 males and 5 females. There was one house in the townland and it was inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 7, being 3 males and 4 females. There were two houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 12, being 6 males and 6 females. There were two houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 19, being 8 males and 11 females. There were two houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are two families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are two families listed in the townland.

Bernile Nienau

Bernhardine Nienau (20 April 1926, Dortmund — 5 October 1943, Munich), called Bernile, was a German girl who became known as "the Führer's child" because of her close friendship with Adolf Hitler that lasted from 1933 to 1938. One of her grandmothers was Jewish.
Early life.
Nienau was born in Dortmund as the only child of Bernhard Nienau, a physician (June 23, 1887 - February 29, 1926). Her father died shortly before she was born. Her mother Karoline, née Helwig, a nurse (March 15, 1892 - July 26, 1962), moved to Munich and bought a house there, around 1928. Bernile's grandmother Ida Voit, a Roman Catholic teacher of Jewish descent, widow or divorcee of Karoline Helwig, née Morgenstern (18 July 1867 - 29 December 1942) also lived with them.
Interaction with Hitler.
Probably at the instigation of her mother, Bernile, whose birthday was, like Hitler's, 20 April, pressed in the spring of 1933 in the forefront of the stream of visitors on Obersalzberg to grab Hitler's attention. From that contact she developed a "friendship" that lasted until 1938. In the Federal Archives in Berlin there are 17 letters which the girl wrote, probably with the help of her mother, between 18 January 1935 and 12 November 1939, to Hitler and his chief aide Wilhelm Brückner. An extract:
Munich, September 27, 36. Dear Uncle Brückner! Today I have a lot to tell you. During the holidays we were on the Obersalzberg and I was twice allowed to dear Uncle Hitler! Unfortunately, you have never been up. [...] I am already working on the Christmas work. [...] Uncle Hitler I knit some socks again because I asked him if they fit him last year. He said yes! This year I can knit with finer wool, mom only helps me with the heel. They are going to be very warm, and where he always travels so much, his feet will not feel cold. [...] Mommy also sends you greetings and many greetings and kisses from your Bernile!
The fact that Bernile's grandmother and mother were Jewish was already known to Hitler in 1933. On 19 April 1938, Hitler's adjutant Fritz Wiedemann described Hitler's disregard for her Jewish ancestry to subordinate party offices as "a purely human attitude toward the child". However, when Martin Bormann got wind of the lack of "German-bloodiness", the girl and her mother were forbidden to appear in Berghof. Hitler learned about it because his personal photographer Heinrich Hoffmann complained that Bormann had forbidden him to continue to publish photos showing the Führer as "his child". In his book "Hitler as I Saw Him"", Hoffmann writes that Hitler said about Bormann: "There are people who have a true talent to spoil my every joy." While Hoffmann's illustrated book "Youth around Hitler" which included the photographs of Hitler with Bernile continued to sell, around May 1938 the mother was officially asked to stop any contacts with party leaders.
Bernile, who learned the profession of a technical draftsman, died on 5 October 1943 at 17 in Schwabing Hospital of spinal poliomyelitis. Her grave is located on the Munich West Cemetery.

Adelita Husni-Bey

Adelita Husni-Bey (born 1985) is a visual artist best known for her films and installations.
Early life and education.
Husni-Bey received a BA in Fine Art from the Chelsea College of Art and Design in London in 2007 and she graduated with an MA in Photography and Uran Cultures from Goldsmiths University in 2009. In 2010, she was selected for the Advanced Course in Visual Art at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti, Como in Italy under visiting professor Hans Haacke. Between 2012 and 2013, Husni-Bey was a fellow researcher for the Independent Study Program at the Whitney Museum of American Art.
Career.
Adelita Husni-Bey's work focuses on complex questions about gender, race and class using collectivist and informal pedagogical models within the framework of urban studies. Her practice involves the analysis and counter-representation of the hegemonic ideology in Western society. Practicing as both an artist and a pedagogue she activates creative processes, such as role-playing, group undertakings and workshops with students, athletes, lawyers, activists and architects. As part of her methodology, she sets up situations and experiments where her collaborators understand their own relationship to the social and economic power of our present times.
In the film "Postcards from the Desert Island" (2011)
the artist documents a three week workshop with children from an experimental, self-run elementary public school in Paris, École Vitruve. The school was created in 1962 with the aim of experimenting with educational models based on co-operation and non-competitiveness. To test the potentiality of radical education, Husni-Bey, inspired by the novel Lord of the Flies (1963) by William Golding, asked a group of children aged between seven and ten years, to imagine their school's hall as a desert island and to relate themselves to the new territory. The film documents how the group of children organize and how they relate to problems and imagine a life without institutions or control, and where to draw the distinction between public and private.
The work "White Paper" (2014 - ongoing) consists of an ongoing research into the relationship between the notion of property, legislation, and the right to housing under capitalism. It focuses on three countries: Egypt, The Netherlands and Spain. The first chapter "White Paper: The Land" (2014) was presented in Cairo at Beirut (art space). It consists of a video-installation focused on the land rights of people affected by the mega-urban development Cairo 2050, a government-backed and privately funded metropolitan development plan of massive proportions, which threatens the livelihood of many informal settlements such as the neighbourhood of Gezirat al-Qursaya and Ramlet Boulaq. The second chapter "White Paper: The Law" (2015) was supported by Casco (Utrecht) and it resulted in a legal document, the "Convention on the Use of Space". The document was written through a series of public drafting meetings across the Netherlands in collaboration with squatters, lawyers, housing rights activists, tenants associations and the general public. For the last chapter of the project "White Paper: The Imaginery" (2016) the Convention travelled to Spain, to Móstoles neighbourhood in Madrid and it was hosted by CA2M. The project was carried on in various independent spaces and squatted social centres, where a number of public meetings were held to draw up the Spanish version of the text. The project is documented by a book, "White Paper On Land, law And The Imaginary" edited by Antonia Alampi, Binna Choi, Jens Maier-Rothe, Pablo Martínez.
"The Reading / La Seduta", was presented at the Italian Pavilion, curated by Cecilia Alemani, at the 2017 Venice Biennale. The artist organized a workshop in Mannahatta (Lenape territory, known as Manhattan, New York) with a group of youngsters which consisted of meetings, discussions and theatre exercises inspired by the Theater of the Oppressed. The activities were focused on participants' connection to the environment and to the exploitation of the earth in relation to complex topics such as technology, use, value, threat and vulnerability. The workshops resulted in a film where the artist designed a tarot deck which was used as a performative device and an excuse as well for participants to talk about their own spiritual, colonial, and technological relationships to the earth and land. The installation was accompanied by a series of sculptures representing luminescent silicone hands.
Prizes and nominations.
In 2016, Husni-Bey was the recipient of the Illy Prize for artists under 35 at the 16th Rome Quadriennale. 
In 2013, she was nominated for the Furla Foundation prize. 
In 2012, she won the Victor Pinchuk Foundation award in Kyiv (Ukraine), and she was awarded of the Young Collector’s Prize at the Rome Artfair, resulting in the acquisition of her work by the MAXXI Museum in Rome. 
In 2011 Husni-Bey won the Euromobil Bologna Artfair prize as ‘Best artist under 30’.

<doc id="56683465" url="?curid=56683465" title="Esteban Hotesse">
Esteban Hotesse

Esteban Hotesse (February 11, 1919 – July 8, 1945) (also known as "Stephen Hotesse") was an black American United States Army Air Force second lieutenant and member of the World War II combat fighter group, the Tuskegee Airmen. He was the only Dominican-born member of the Tuskegee Airmen. He died in a B-25 Mitchell crash in July 1945.
Early Life, Family.
Hotesse was born on February 11, 1919 in Moca, Espaillat, Dominican Republic. He was the son of Clara Pacheco, a Dominican woman. On November 1, 1923, Hotesse immigrated to the United States via the Pork of New York at the age of four.
Hotesse was married to Mrs. Iristella {Lind} Hotesse, a Puerto Rican woman. He was the father of two daughters, Mary Lou Hotesse and Rosalie Hotesse. Before applying to the Tuskegee Flight School Program, Hotesse and his family were living in Manhattan, New York. After serving as a U.S. Army officer, he and his family applied for U.S. citizenship in April 1943.
Military Career.
Hotesse was admitted to the Tuskegee Flight School Program on February, 21, 1942, through which he received his 2nd lieutenant commission and flight wings.
Hotesse did not see combat during World War II, remaining stateside his short three-year career. His only two assignments were the 477th Bombardment Group, Medium, Fort Knox, Kentucky to Freeman Field (1942-1943), and the 619th Bombardment Squadron (Medium), Godman Field (1943-1945)
Freeman Field Mutiny.
On April 5, 1945, Hotesse was among several black officers within the 477th Bombardment Group arrested in the Freeman Field Mutiny. 
Colonel Robert Selway, a white United States Army Air Forces officer and first commanding officer of the Tuskegee Airmen's 477th Medium Bombardment Group within the First Air Force, designated the Officer's Club for "supervisory and instructor personnel" and another more substandard facility for "trainees." Like his ranking officer, First Air Force commanding general, the state of Georgia's Major General Frank O'Driscoll Hunter, Colonel Selway was a racial segregationist. Intentionally, Selway classified all members of the all-black 447th Bombardment Group as trainees, effectively segregating the officer clubs by race. His illegal, racially discriminatory maneuver violated U.S. Army Regulation 210-10, Paragraph 19, which prohibited any public building on a military installation from being used "for the accommodation of any self-constituted special or exclusive group," thereby requiring officers' clubs be open to all officers regardless of race. For the next two days, black officers in groups ranging from twelve to twenty entered the whites-only club peacefully. 36 black officers entered the Officer's Club first day and were arrested when they refused to leave, while 35 officers were arrested the following night. 
Shortly after, Colonel Selway implemented Base Regulation 85-2, assigning specific housing, mess, and recreational facilities to officers. Selway proceeded to order each officer to sign a form confirming that they had read and understood the regulation. 101 of the 422 officers refused to sign, and were arrested for insubordination.
On April 23, General George Marshall ordered the 101 released, including Hotesse, while General Henry H. Arnold transferred command of the 477th Bombardment Group to Colonel Benjamin O. Davis Jr.
Civil Rights historians regard the Freeman Field Mutiny as a seminal event towards Truman's eventual full integration of the U.S. armed forces.
Death.
Hotesse was serving as a Pilot with the 619th Squadron, 447th Bombardment Group. On July 8, 1945, Hotesse died in a B-25J Mitchell (#44-30746) crash at the Ohio River between Indiana and Kentucky, northeast of Vevay, Indiana and Madison County, Kentucky. The Pilot 1st Lieutenant Samuel A Black, Jr, Pilot Flight Officer Glenn W Pulliam and Co-pilot Glenn Fullian were also killed. Engineer Isiah Grice suffered no injuries. Gunner Napoleon G suffered major injuries. The U.S. War Department ascribed the accident in the following accident report: 
 On July 8, 1945, the twin engine B-25 (B= bomber) aircraft departed Godman Field, Kentucky for a military exercise over Hayes Bombing Range and then a training flight. The aircraft was to drop its bombs and then continue on a low altitude cross country where the co-pilot would take the controls. At Madison, Indiana the copilot began his decent from 1,000 feet to his assigned altitude of 100 feet above terrain. The copilot dropped below his assigned altitude, with water splashing onto the aircraft, both pilots attempted to pull on the yoke to gain altitude, with no success. The aircraft crashed into the Ohio River in Indiana killing the pilot, copilot and Hotesse. It was reported the upon impact the cockpit and tail broke away from the aircraft. 
Legacy.
On August 23, the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute and U.S. Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) hosted a ceremony to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Esteban Hotesse posthumously during an exhibit honoring Dominicans' World War II military contributions.

George Crowninshield Jr.

George Crowninshield Jr. (May 27, 1766 – November 26, 1817) was an American merchant, industrialist, shipowner, and yachtsman. He was involved with his father's commercial international trade George Crowninshield &amp; Sons that conducted a shipping business in the West Indies, Europe, India and China. Because of this exposure to ships he became wealthy and was involved in making the first American yacht. 
Crowninshield, at his own expense, recovered two bodies of American naval officers that were killed during the War of 1812. It was rumored that he may have rescued Napoleon Bonaparte from exile with a luxurious pleasure yacht he owned. He was well known in the Salem social circles because of his personality. He never married, but did have a daughter.
Early life.
Crowninshield was born at Salem, Massachusetts, on May 27, 1766. He was the son of George Crowninshield (1734–1815) and Mary (née Derby) Crowninshield (1737–1813), who married in 1757. Crowninshield was the eldest of five adult brothers. His father and grandfather were both merchants, doing business in East India and China.
Mid life.
Crowninshield went to local public schools until he was twelve. Then he studied navigation and first went to sea as a captain’s clerk and assisted in commanding a ship to the West Indies in 1790. He commanded the ship "Belisarius" to the East Indies in 1794. Crowninshield’s work was largely in the construction and outfitting of his family's ships.
His father was the founder of the mercantile house of George Crowninshield &amp; Sons. The firm was engaged in commerce with the West Indies, Europe, India and China. He was admitted into his father's Salem firm in 1801 and immediately built a sloop he named the "Jefferson." This was the first American yacht and with it, Crowninshield became the first American yachtsman. He cruised the yacht for several years under the United States flag. Crowninshield took over the family firm upon the death of his father in 1815 and became an international merchant. Through these endeavors he became wealthy and was afforded substantial leisure time.
Personal.
Crowninshield was a short person of in height and wore extravagant clothing like Hessian boots with gold tassels. He donned a pigtail and a shaggy beaver-skin hat. He was known around Salem for his extracurricular activities, such as driving around the city in his bright yellow curricle. He liked chasing down fires of burning buildings. Rescuing people from ships in distress, for the purpose of which he maintained a vessel, was a passion of his.
Crowninshield procured all the necessary paperwork from Washington D.C.to bring home to Salem the bodies of Captain James Lawrence and Lieutenant Augustus Ludlow. They were killed in the defeat of the by the British vessel on June 1, 1813. He chartered the brig "Henry" at his own expense and manned it with a crew that sailed to Halifax, Nova Scotia. His crew were ship captains from the Salem Marine Society. The bodies were recovered and taken back to Salem. They arrived on August 23, 1813. Preparations meanwhile were made for a formal funeral that was attended by many high ranking officers of the United States Navy and the US Vice President.
Crowninshield gained notoriety with his luxury pleasure yacht "Cleopatra's Barge". The elaborate schooner with a deluxe interior was launched in 1816. Those that knew Crowninshield's admiration for Napoleon Bonaparte put it together that there was a good possibility he and his brothers rescued the Emperor from his exile on Saint Helena Island and took him back to America. It was speculated by author Francis Boardman Crowninshield that the sole purpose of "Cleopatra's Barge" was for the object of rescuing Napoleon, but that has not been conclusively proven. 
Crowninshield never married, but did have one daughter born 1811, Clarissa (called Clara), whose mother was Elizabeth Rowell. Born in Salem, Clara was a friend of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow who considered her like a sister. When Crowninshield died he bequeathed a large sum of money to Clara and her mother in his will. Benjamin Ropes Nichols, a Salem attorney, informally adopted Clara on the death of Crowninshield. Clara was sent to a female seminary in Hingham, Massachusetts. There her studies consisted of Latin, French, German, and literature. She became a friend of Mary Storer Potter, Longfellow's first wife. Clara recorded in her diary events of an eighteen-month trip (1835–1836) to Europe with the Longfellows. Clara married a Mr. Louis Thies in 1843. They had a son and a daughter. Clara died in Dresden in 1907.
Crowninshield died of a heart attack in Salem onboard "Cleopatra's Barge" on November 26, 1817. He is buried in Salem.

Night Hawk (horse)

Night Hawk (1910 – after 1924) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was unraced as a juvenile and showed solid, but unremarkable form in his first four starts as a three-year-old in 1913 before recording a 50/1 upset victory in the St Leger. He failed to win or place in five subsequent races and was retired at the end of 1914. He has been described as one of the worst classic winners of the 20th century. He made no impact as a breeding stallion. It was said of him "Night Hawk has only one speed, but he stays forever".
Background.
Night Hawk was a bay horse bred by his owner William Hall Walker in County Kildare, Ireland (then a part of the United Kingdom). He was sent into training with William Thomas "Jack" Robinson at his Foxhill stables in Wiltshire.
Night Hawk's sire Gallinule was an exceptionally fast and precocious horse who won the National Breeders' Produce Stakes as a juvenile in 1886. He later became a very successful breeding stallion whose other offspring included Pretty Polly and Wildfowler. Night Hawk was one of ten winners produced by the broodmare Jean's Folly. Her dam, Black Cherry, was a moderate racehorse, but a great success at stud, being the direct female ancestor of numerous successful Thoroughbreds including Blandford, Sun Chariot, Carrozza, Sherluck, Santa Claus, Shahrastani.
Racing career.
1913: three-year-old season.
Having been unraced as a juvenile, Night Hawk made his racecourse debut at Hurst Park in late May when he ran fourth behind Fairy King, Pandeen and Aghdoe in a race over one mile. In the St George Stakes over eleven furlongs at Liverpool on 23 July Night Hawk finished second to Aghdoe with the Epsom Derby winner Aboyeur in third. He then returned to Hurst Park and ran second to Birlingham over ten furlongs. At Derby Racecourse in early September Night Hawk ran third behind Roseworthy and the 2000 Guineas winner Louvois, receiving fifteen pounds in weight from the first two.
On 10 September Night Hawk contested the 138th running of the St Leger Stakes over fourteen and a half furlongs on unusually hard ground at Doncaster Racecourse. Ridden by Elijah Wheatley he started a 50/1 outsider in a twelve-runner field which included Louvois (the 9/4 favourite), Aghdoe, Bachelor's Wedding (Irish Derby, Roseworthy, Birlingham and Seremond Richmond Stakes. Louvois led and set a very fast pace until half a mile from the finish when he gave way to Seremond who was in turn overtaken by Jack Joel's White Magic. Night Hawk, however, having been tailed-off in last place at one point, made rapid progress through the field, took the lead approaching the last quarter mile and won "easily" by two lengths from White Magic, with three lengths back to Seremond in third. The winning time of 3:03.6 was a new record for the race. William Hall Walker, who did not attend the race, was recording his first success in the St Leger, although he had bred two previous winners of the classic in Prince Palatine and Minoru. An unusual feature of the result was that while the first three home were all outsiders, the first three in the betting- Louvois, Aghdoe and Bachelor's Wedding were the last three to finish.
In October Night Hawk started joint-favourite for the Cesarewitch Handicap over two and a quarter miles at Newmarket Racecourse but looked beaten a long way from home and finished unplaced behind the 50/1 winner Fiz-Yama. On 5 November Night Hawk finished last of the five runners in the Liverpool St Leger.
Night Hawk ended the season with earnings of £6,450.
1914: four-year-old season.
Night Hawk remainedin training asafour-year-old but failed to win a race. At Royal Ascot in June he finished ninth of the ten runners behind the five-year-old Aleppo the Ascot Gold Cup. In late July he ran unplaced behind Collodion in the Goodwood Plate over two miles and three furlongs.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Night Hawk as the worst St Leger winner of the 20th century.
Stud record.
At the end of his racing career Night Hawk was retired to become a breeding stallion and was subsequently exported to stand in New South Wales, Australia. Bought for 500 guineas by Reginald White of the Merton Stud, he arrived in Sydney on 25 November 1918, but by that time, White had decided to sell his stud farm. He was sold to the Martindale Stud at Muswellbrook in April 1919. Night Hawk had very little success as a sire of winners.

Jefferson (yacht)

Jefferson was the first American yacht. She was owned by George Crowninshield Jr. The yacht was primarily a pleasure craft, but she also fulfilled other purposes, including that of a rescue vessel, a privateer during the War of 1812, and a fishing boat.
History.
"Jefferson" was the first American boat designed specifically to use as a yacht. The yacht was constructed in Salem in 1801 for Crowninshield. She was christened "Jefferson," named after the new U.S. President Thomas Jefferson. The next yacht of record was "Diver", made for John Cox Stevens in 1802. The following yachts were "Trouble", "Wave," "Onkahie," "Ginicrack," and "Maria." "Jefferson" proved herself to be a vessel that traveled well on the water. The infamous "Cleopatra's Barge" was built in 1816, some fifteen years after "Jefferson" was constructed.
"Jefferson" was originally rigged as a schooner and later was a sloop. The length of the sloop yacht was 35 feet 10 inches and her beam was 12 feet 4 inches. The yacht's depth was 6 feet and she had a tonnage of 22 American tons burden. Christopher Turne, a Salem shipwright, was the yacht's builder. She was launched March, 1801, from Turne's place where he made boats at Union Wharf. Crowninshield used "Jefferson" in Massachusetts Bay (then known as Salem Bay). The pleasure yacht was built for safety and comfort. The first American yacht for over a decade was enjoyed by Crowninshield and his family. He kept the boat stocked with provisions for everyone's enjoyment. One of Crowninshield's passions was that after a storm he would go out into Massachusetts Bay with the vessel and look for boats in trouble that needed help. 
Crowninshield was a firm believer in the policy of striking the enemy's vessels on the water first before they could do any damage. The family was among the first to fit out boats as privateers in the War of 1812. "Jefferson" was one of three such boats sent out by them. The other two were "American" and "John." "Jefferson" was the second privateer commissioned in the war, and brought in the second prize, the schooner "Nymph". She carried a crew of 30 men, a large number for a vessel 36 feet long; after one voyage it was decided she was too small for the work. Upon the death of Crowninshield, "Jefferson" was sold by the family in 1815 and became a fishing vessel. The yacht was useful for this purpose for many years. The yacht then belonged to Captain John Crowninshield Very of Marblehead, Massachusetts, and later to Caleb Johnson of Nahant, Massachusetts.

Tonlegee

Tonlegee () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The townland was also called "Clonmeoun", probably an Anglicisation of the Gaelic 'Cluain Mín' meaning "The Smooth Meadow".
Geography.
Tonlegee is bounded on the north by Derrynaslieve and Derryvella (Corlough) townlands, on the south by Muineal townland, on the west by Clarbally and Knockmore, County Cavan townlands and on the east by Derryconnessy townland. Its chief geographical features are small streams and dug wells. Tonlegee is traversed by the R202 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 134 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Tonlegee was located in the ballybetagh of Ballymackgonghan (Irish = "Baile Mac Eochagain", meaning 'McEoghan's Town'). 
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 24 February 1614, King James VI and I granted, inter alia, "one pole of Clonmeoun to Phelim McHugh O'Reyly, Bryan McHugh O'Reyly and Cahir McHugh O'Reyly, the sons of Hugh Reyly, late of Ballaghaneo, County Cavan". Ballaghaneo is now the townland of Ballaghanea in Lurgan Parish, County Cavan, on the shores of Lough Ramor, so the O'Reillys were removed a long way from their home by the Plantation. Hugh Reyly was the great-grandnephew of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eoghan na Fésóige mac Seoain, who ruled East Breifne from 1418 to 1449. The O’Reilly lands in Tonlegee were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Clanmoyn" with the proprietor being "Captain Payne".
In the Hearth Money Rolls compiled on 29 September 1663 there was one Hearth Tax payer in "Tonage- Cahell McGawran".
A lease dated 31 January 1718 from Morley Saunders to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Tonlegee".
A lease dated 10 December 1774 from William Crookshank to John Enery of Bawnboy includes the lands of "Tonlegee", as does a further deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774.
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Tonlegee".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Tonlagee" and the proprietor as "John Ennery".
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Tonlegee".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list eight tithepayers in the townland.
The Tonlegee Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 55, being 25 males and 30 females. There were nine houses in the townland, of which one was uninhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 58, being 32 males and 26 females. There were eight houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists seven landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 55, being 31 males and 24 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 45, being 27 males and 18 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 48, being 29 males and 19 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 41, being 21 males and 20 females. There were seven houses in the townland, all were inhabited.

Mass mortality event

A mass mortality event (MME) is an incident that kills a vast number of individuals of a single species in a short period of time. The event may put a species at risk of extinction or upset an ecosystem. This is distinct from the mass die-off associated with short lived and synchronous emergent insect taxa which is a regular and non-catastrophic occurrence.
Causes of MME's include disease and human-related activities such as pollution. Climatic extremes and other environmental influences such as oxygen stress in aquatic environments play a role, as does starvation. In many MME's there are multiple stressors. An analysis of such events from 1940 to 2012 found that these events have become more common for birds, fish and marine invertebrates, but have declined for amphibians and reptiles and not changed for mammals.
Known mass mortality events.
Migratory birds (1904).
In March 1904, 1.5 million migrating birds died in Minnesota and Iowa during a strong snowstorm. According to "The Guardian", this was the largest avian mortality event on record in the region. Records of MMEs have been kept since the 1880s. MMEs of this size are rare, however, and few before or since have been as big as the 1904 event. According to the records, MMEs "are always associated with extreme weather events such as a drop in temperature, snowstorm or hailstorm".
George River caribou (1984).
In 1984, about 10,000 caribou of the George River caribou herd—one of Canada's migratory woodland caribou herds—drowned during their bi-annual crossing of the Caniapiscau River when the James Bay Hydro Project flooded the region.
Harbour seals (1988).
In 1988, the deaths of 20,000 harbour seals in the North Sea were found to be caused by phocine distemper virus. Ten years later, two strains of bacteria were implicated in the deaths of approximately 1,600 New Zealand sea lions. On Marion Island in 2007, some 250–300 adult male subantarctic fur seals died in a two-week period. It was suggested, though not proven, that this gender-biased mortality was caused by "Streptococcus sanguinis", a bacterium carried by the house mouse, an alien species accidentally introduced to the island in the 1800s.
Mule deer (2003).
In the Inyo National Forest in California, there are several records of large numbers of migrating mule deer falling to their deaths by slipping on ice while crossing mountain passes. This has occurred when heavy snowfalls have persisted until fall, and have been turned to ice by frequent thawing and refreezing. In 2003, a rain-on-snow event encased the ground in ice, resulting in the starvation of 20,000 muskoxen on Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic.
Drum fish (2010).
In the final week of December 2010, approximately 83,000 dead and dying drum fish washed up along a 20-mile stretch of the Arkansas River about 100 miles west of Beebe, Arkansas. The cause was speculated to be disease while full test results were expected after one month.
Birds (2010).
Shortly before midnight on New Year's Eve 2010, between 3,000 and 5,000 red-winged blackbirds fell from the sky in Beebe, Arkansas. Most died upon hitting the ground, but some were living but dazed. Laboratory tests were performed and the Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission, the National Wildlife Health Center in Madison, Wisconsin, and the University of Georgia's wildlife disease study group procured specimens of the dead birds. In addition to the blackbirds, a few grackles and starlings also fell from the sky in the same incident. A test report from the state poultry lab concluded that the birds had died from blunt trauma, with an unlicensed fireworks discharge being the likely cause.
Seabirds and marine life (2010–2013).
The months-long Deepwater Horizon oil spill that began in April 2010 in the coastal waters of the Gulf of Mexico resulted in about 600,000 to 800,000 bird mortalities. Dolphins and other species of marine life continued to die in record numbers into 2013.
Birds (2011).
The Beebe, Arkansas bird deaths were repeated again on New Year's Eve of the following year, 2011, with the reported number of dead birds being 5,000.
On January 3, 2011, more than five hundred starlings, red-winged blackbirds, and sparrows fell dead in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana.
On January 5, "hundreds" of dead turtle doves were found at Faenza, Italy. According to Italian news agencies, a huge number of the birds were found to have blue stains on their beaks that may have been caused by paint or hypoxia.
Over the weekend of January 8–9, "over a hundred" dead birds were found clustered together on a California highway, while "thousands of dead gizzard shad" (a species of fish) turned up in the harbors of Chicago.
Fish (2011).
Between 28 December 2010 and 3 January 2011, 100 tons of dead fish washed ashore on the Brazilian coast.
On 3 January, an estimated two million dead fish were found floating in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland.
On 7 March, millions of small fish, including anchovies, sardines, and mackerel, were found dead in the area of King Harbor at Redondo Beach, California. An investigation by the authorities within the area concluded that the sardines had become trapped within the harbor and depleted the ambient oxygen, which resulted in the deaths. The authorities stated that the event was "unusual, but not unexplainable."
Cows (2011).
On 14 January, approximately two hundred cows were found dead in a field in Stockton, Wisconsin. The owner of the cattle has told deputies that he suspected the animals died of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), or bovine virus diarrhea (BVD). Authorities in Wisconsin sent samples from the carcasses to labs in Madison in order to determine cause of death.
Saiga antelope (2015).
In 2015, some 200,000 saiga antelope died within a period of one week in a 20 km2 area of the Betpak-Dala desert region of Kazakhstan. They had gathered in large groups for their annual calving. It was determined that warm and humid temperatures had caused "Pasteurella multocida", a strain of bacteria that normally lives harmlessly in their tonsils, to cross into their bloodstream and cause hemorrhagic septicemia. This event wiped out 60% of the population of this critically endangered species.
Mass mortality events are not uncommon for saiga. In 1981, 70,000 died; in 1988 there were 200,000 deaths; and more recently, in 2010, 12,000 died.
Seabirds (2015–2016).
Starting in the summer of 2015 and continuing into the spring of 2016, about 62,000 dead or dying birds were found on Pacific Ocean beaches from California to Alaska. Some researchers believe that as many as one million common murres may have died in the massive die-off.
Fish (2016).
In May 2016, the "Los Angeles Times" reported that millions of fish had washed ashore along the coast of north-central Vietnam, stretching over 125 miles of beaches. This included the shoreline in the Phu Loc district, in Thua Thien Hue province. Possible causes include industrial pollution, as government researchers had found that "toxic elements" had caused the "unprecedented" fish mortalities. Concerns were raised about a "massive Taiwanese-owned steel plant" that was allegedly "pumping untreated wastewater" into the ocean.
Brumby (2019).
In 2019, an extreme heatwave with temperatures exceeding 42 °C in central Australia lead to the death of approximately 40 brumbies.
Bats.
In 2014 and 2018, heatwaves in Australia killed significant portions of local bat populations.
Migratory birds (2020).
In August 2020, observers reported that hundreds of dead migratory birds heading south for the winter had been found at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. By September, the number had increased to tens of thousands, and the die-off had spread across at least New Mexico, Colorado, Texas, Arizona, and farther north into Nebraska. The birds were migrating species, including "owls, warblers, hummingbirds, loons, flycatchers, and woodpeckers". They seemed to be emaciated, as if they had just kept on flying until they dropped. Possible causes of the deaths include climate crisis and wildfires, according to "The Guardian".
Explanations.
According to most scientists, massive die-offs of animals are not necessarily unusual in nature and may happen for any of a wide variety of reasons, both preventable and unpreventable. Natural causes often include severe weather, volcanic eruptions, disease outbreaks, and accidental poisonings, while human-caused die-offs are typically due to pollution (especially major oil and chemical spills) and climate change adding to the stresses on wildlife. The U.S. Geological Survey's website listed about 90 mass deaths of birds and other wildlife from June through 12 December 2010; Louisiana's State Wildlife Veterinarian Jim LaCour stated that there had been 16 similar mass blackbird deaths in the previous 30 years. Sudden or short-term die-offs must also be distinguished from much longer-term extinction events, which have occurred naturally for countless species throughout the Earth's history and for many extant species are often demonstrated to be ongoing, if gradually, in the modern era.
On the other hand, some mass die-offs appear to be unique because there are no previous records of similar occurrences, or because the likely cause of death can be pinpointed to a novel man-made event that has never previously existed; human technologies of a type or scale unknown at any prior point in history are frequently implicated in catastrophic mortality events. These types of mass die-offs are, then, unusual by definition. According to Italy's WWF president Giorgio Tramonti, mass dove deaths like the ones that occurred in Italy had never happened before 2010. The event in Arkansas was attributed primarily to an unexpected temperature change causing atmospheric turbulence (visible on NEXRAD Doppler weather radar images) above the birds' roosting areas, which likely disoriented them.
Apocalypse.
Some Christians assert that this particular cluster of animal mass deaths is a sign of the Apocalypse. They reference a passage in the "Book of Hosea" in the Hebrew Bible which reads: "By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood," and the prophecy continues "Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away."
The term "aflockalypse" was adopted by some media commentators in reference to the 2010–2011 bird deaths. "Aflockalypse" is a portmanteau of the words "flock" and "apocalypse".

John R. Fraser

John R. Fraser FRCOG (1890-1959) was a physician on the staff of the Obstetric and Gynaecological Department at McGill and in 1929, professor, chairman and head of department at McGill and Royal Victoria Hospital.
During the First World War he served with the Canadian Army reaching the rank of major before he was decommissioned in 1919. He was a founding fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.
In 1936, whilst head of Obstetrics and gynaecology at McGill, Fraser met W. A. Scott, head of Obstetrics and gynaecology at the University of Toronto. This meeting gave opportunity for their juniors to meet. This younger generation of surgeon had grievances with the medical system that excluded younger surgeons from taking on major surgical cases, and in a "rebellious" decision conspired and established the Canadian Gynaecological Society (CGS), also known as the Canadian Gynaecological Travel Club and the senior Travel Club. With the objective of uniting Toronto and McGill, the aim was to promote education and to exert influence on departmental activities. Fraser became an honorary member. Remote from the aspirations of the juniors, Fraser, along with other seniors, dominated the early meetings and as a consequence, the juniors decided to exclude department heads from membership.

Antonio Altoviti

Antonio Altoviti (Rome, 1521 - Florence, 28 December 1573) was an Italian Catholic archbishop, son of Bindo Altoviti and archbishop of Florence from 1548 to 1573.
Life.
Antonio Altoviti was the son of Bindo Altoviti and Fiammetta Soderini. His father was one of the most influential bankers and patron of the arts of the Renaissance. His grandmother Dianora Altoviti was known as La Papessa on account of the influences she had held over her uncle, Pope Innocent VIII. In Rome the Altoviti and Cybo were since the times of Cosimo de' Medici Il Vecchio allies of the Medici. Bindo Altoviti's career flourished under the pontificate of Leo X and Clement VII.
Of versatile genius, Antonio was initiated to the ecclesiastical career, under the protection of one of the most authoritative Florentine prelates of the early sixteenth century, Cardinal Niccolò Ridolfi. Later he became the dean of the Apostolic Chamber and secretary of Paul III.
After the death of Clement VII and duke Alessandro de' Medici, the Altoviti sided with Catherine de' Medici and Pope Paul III, getting into an open confrontation with Cosimo I de' Medici. In 1548, as a poke in the eye to Cosimo, Pope Paul III appointed Bindo's son, Antonio Altoviti, as Archbishop of Florence. Furious by this open affront, Cosimo I. retaliated by banning the new Archbishop from setting foot in the city and even seized all the income and assets of the diocese.
The next twenty years he spend most of the time in Rome where he explicated considerable activity during the famine of Rome in 1559, alongside with his friend and ally Cardinal Guido Ascanio Sforza di Santa Fiora. He also took part in the Council of Trent and lived for a period in Loreto, where he built a chapel dedicated to St. Elizabeth. Because of his young age and to secure power of the Altoviti in Florence he was not appointed cardinal.
After the death of Paul III (1549) Cosimo I. lost no time in asking his successors to deliver the rebellious archbishop to him, but all refused. Nevertheless, within the next years Cosimo I. manifested a policy of rapprochement with the popes in anticipation of his request to obtain the title of Grand Duke. In 1564 Pope Pius IV, Giovanni Angelo de' Medici, asked Cosimo I. to enforce the decree of the Council of Trent. Cosimo I. responded to the plea by granting forgiveness to the Altoviti and writing to Antonio Altoviti urging him to return to Florence to take command of his diocese and begin a process of reformation.
Antonio Altoviti finally took possession of the archdiocese in 1567. He entered the Florence with so much pomp, solemnity and court of nobles, that Cosimo I. was so irritated, understanding this triumphal event as a humiliation of his sovereign authority, but ordinated in the same year his nephew Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, to whom Antonio Altoviti a mentor, succeeded him as archbishop and became Pope Leo XI. The friendship between Antonio Altoviti and Alessandro Ottaviano de' Medici, continued the reconciliation between the House of Altoviti and the new ducal branch of the House of Medici. In 1569, Pius V finally conferred the title of grand duke of Tuscany on Cosimo I.
Antonio Altoviti was unanimously considered a prelate of absolute moral integrity and remarkable spiritual and cultural sensitivity. He was a man of virtue with admirable pastoral supervision, which he also wanted to emphasize in his coat of arms depicting a dog guarding a flock, with the motto "non dormit qui vigilat".
In 1573 he called a provincial synod but suddenly died on December 28 of the same year, fifty-two years old. He was buried in a monument behind the church of the Santi Apostoli in Florence, under the patronage of his family, in a funeral monument by Giovanni Antonio Dosio and Giovanni Caccini.

He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands

He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands is the twenty-second full-length album of American indie rock band Joan of Arc. It is the first album by the band to include guitarist and vocalist Melina Ausikaitis as part of the lineup. The LP is a set of eleven tracks assembled from nine hours' worth of jam session recordings. Despite following a more restrained of the band's chaotic, unconventional style, "He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands" still garnered mixed responses from reviewers for said style's lack of accessibility to listeners. The album peaked number 26 and [[five on [[Billboard (magazine)|"Billboard"]]'s American [[Independent Albums]] and [[Heatseekers Albums]] charts, respectively.
Production.
In making the album, Joan of Arc first tried to plan out the songs, but the group was unable to come up with anything "interesting" with that method. They realized the only way they could make interesting songs was through hours-long [[jam session]]s, but they didn't have the budget to record them in a studio. Thus, using a mobile recording device, the group recorded in several "weird spaces", such as a basketball court of a hotel, an [[Airbnb]] service, and an industrial space in [[West Side, Chicago]]. As [[Tim Kinsella]] described the sessions, "We hit Record and played, and our collective tastes emerged. And they, our tastes in the moment, were the only standards in all the expanse of the stupefying and beautiful unknown universe, that we regarded as relevant in the least." The group recorded nine hours of material that was later edited into 23 tracks. Finally, "the best 10 or 12 songs didn't end up on the record, it was the best sequence of stuff," explained Kinsella.
Composition.
Drew Fortune categorized "He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands" as was would happen "if the [[Butthole Surfers]] recorded a post-rock record". Some critics found the LP to be a more relaxed take on the band's otherwise chaotic and bizarre style than their previous releases, being more atmospheric and melodic than the band's previous LPs. As per usual for the band's music, the lyrical content, in the words of Fortune, "straddles the line between surrealist poet and agitator". Some reviewers noted constant tonal shifts in the lyrics, which go from "daft-but-harmless" to "lines that leave a bitter taste in the mouth", summarized "[[Drowned in Sound]]". The lyrics have very obscure meanings, but some critics suggested the album, based on the lyrics, sound, and its title (a combination of the names of "[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]" and "[[This Land is Your Land]]"), was about staying calm in a time of dissolution in a society. "He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands" is the first Joan of Arc album with Melina Ausikaitis in its lineup, who "often plays the role of the band's [[Flavor Flav]], throwing in punchlines during Kinsella's verses and backing him up in makeshift choruses," writer David Anthony summarized.
Critical reception.
Like with past Joan of Arc records, reviews for "He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land in His Hands" were mixed in general primarily due to the lack of accessibility of its experimental style. In a favorable review, Ian King of "[[PopMatters]]" claimed that with "He's Got The Whole", "patience, and collaboration continue to focus and invigorate Joan of Arc." He also wrote that it was "impressive that Kinsella's hyperactive imagination has relented so little." Noting the LP's chaotic style to be more "relaxed" than previous albums by the group, "[[Exclaim!]]" labeled it "a minor gem in the Joan of Arc discography, as Kinsella gives listeners more simply by pulling back."
"[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]" called it "a slow-grower, worth applying oneself too", reasoning that when it is "stripped of the discord and uncomfortable shock-factor references, the melodic interchanges can be extremely pleasant and directional. Joan of Arc knows how to build with an emotive goal, and "He's Got the Whole This Land Is Your Land In His Hands" has moments where it gives the weird a glorious grounding and juxtaposition."
An [[AllMusic]] critic stated that "He's Got the Whole" "may alienate even some of Kinsella's more patient and open-eared fans, as it sometimes wanders into a slow ramble over repetitive dissonance," but "its impulsive quality may be irresistible to a punkier sensibility, offering catharsis in its deliberate lack of polish and self-censorship." Anthony opined that "He's Got the Whole" did deserve respect for staying committed to an [[experimental music|experimental]] style, but "it's often so obtuse it feels like it's not meant for anyone but its creators." Evan Rytlewski of "[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]", however, dismissed the album as a "troll manifesto" and described it as Kinsella's most "irritating" record due to its "off-putting" humor of the lyrics and its tuneless sound: ""He's Got the Whole" is presented as good fun, but it's only fun in a one-sided, "why are you hitting yourself?" sort of way."

Toy (song)

"Toy" (Hebrew transliteration: ) is a song recorded by Israeli singer Netta, and was Israel's submission to the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, which it won. The track was written by Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, and produced by Beger. The song was released on 11 March 2018 along with its official music video clip, which was directed by Keren Hochma. The song was leaked online a day before the official release.
The song won the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with 529 points. It marks Israel's fourth Eurovision win along with 1978, 1979 and 1998. The song reached the top of the charts in Israel.
The song became the most viewed video on Eurovision Song Contest's YouTube channel on 27 May 2018 and is the second most viewed entry from Eurovision, after Russia's 2020 entry "Uno".
The song is featured in the game "Just Dance 2019".
Lyrics.
The song's lyrics are mostly in English, with the exception of the Hebrew phrase ("ani lo buba", "I am not a doll"), and the slang word ("stefa", meaning a pile of banknotes). The Japanese word "baka" ( "stupid") is also used extensively and the "Pokémon" character Pikachu is used once. "Trump-pam-pau" refers to the President of the United States, Donald Trump, as Doron Medalie revealed in April 2019 to the Israeli media.
Eurovision Song Contest.
"Toy" was first drawn to compete at the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest 2018, in which it was performed seventh in a field of nineteen songs, and achieved first place, based on a combination of fourth placing from televote and first from jury. It thus qualified for the final, under a format progressing the top ten most-voted songs from each semi-final. In the final the song was performed 22nd in a field of 26, and won, based on third placing with 212 points from the jury and winning the televote with 317 points, achieving overall first place with a combined score of 529 points which Israel later won hosting rights for 2019 in Tel Aviv.
Critical reception.
Charlotte Runcie of "The Daily Telegraph" awarded the song five stars out of five, describing it as "gloriously bizarre pop" with "playful lyrics and a powerful vocal performance".
Allegations were made that the performance of the song at Eurovision featured appropriation of Japanese cultural imagery as a "prop", including Netta wearing a kimono and buns, and the performance's staging featuring Maneki-nekos—a Japanese symbol of luck. Netta did not respond to the allegations, but did state in previous interviews that she was a follower of Japanese popular culture, particularly the "Pokémon" franchise.
Copyright claim.
On 3 July 2018, Israeli infotainer Guy Pines reported that Universal Music Group may file a lawsuit claiming "Toy" similarities in rhythm and harmony with The White Stripes' song "Seven Nation Army". Universal sent a pre-suit notice letter to the songwriters Doron Medalie and Stav Beger, claiming copyright infringement. In February 2019 the Israeli composers agreed to give writing credit to Jack White, and he gets a share in the royalties for the song. Medalie and Beger had reportedly agreed to give Universal some of the song's distribution rights in certain territories, potentially exposing the song to an even larger audience.

Ralph Rodgerson (footballer, born 1913)

Ralph Rodgerson (25 December 1913 – 18 April 1972) was an English professional footballer who played in the Football League as a full back for Sunderland.
Life and career.
Rodgerson was born in Sunderland in 1913, the son of Ralph Rodgerson and his wife Evelyn. Ralph senior was a professional footballer who played in the Football League for Huddersfield Town and Leeds United and in the Scottish League for Dundee.
Rodgerson played Sunderland and District League football for Millfieldhe also played cricket for the Miilfield club alongside his fatherand Wearside League football for Shotton Colliery Welfare before signing professional forms with Football League First Division club Sunderland in December 1935. With the club's sixth League title already confirmed, Rodgerson was given a debut on 18 April 1936, playing at left back in a 4–3 win at home to Huddersfield Town, and also played in the remaining two matches of the season, which were both heavy defeats. He made two more first-team appearances, both at home to Manchester United, one in 1936–37 and the last in 1938–39, before competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War.

The Nagasaki Spirit

The Nagasaki Spirit [1997] is an English admiralty law case on marine salvage and on the provisions of Article 13 and 14 of the 1989 Salvage Convention.
The case identified problems with the drafting of the Convention, a response to which was the 2000 SCOPIC codicil which may be attached to the Lloyd's Open Form ("LOF") to vary the terms of the salvage reward.
Facts.
The case involved a collision in 1992 between the oil tanker "The Nagasaki Spirit", laden with 40,000 tons of crude oil, and the container ship, "The Ocean Blessing" in the northern part of the Malacca Straits. After the collisions some 12,000 tons of crude oil escaped into the sea and caught fire; both vessels were engulfed in flames. All the crew of "The Ocean Blessing" perished, and only two crew on "The Nagasaki Spirit" survived. Professional salvors agreed to salve "The Nagasaki Spirit" under LOF 1990 (which included Arts 13 and 14 of the Convention). Using several tugs, the fire was extinguished, the cargo transshipped and the vessel safely redelivered to her owners.
The collision was a result of the vessel having been taken by pirates who then abandoned ship, leaving the vessel still under way yet without any bridge officers in control.
Judgments.
The award arbitrator fixed Special Compensation, stressing the need to encourage environmental salvage.
The appeal arbitrator increased the Art 13 award, and since that was higher than the Art 14 award, he held that no Special Compensation was available.
On appeal, the admiralty judge held that although "fair rate" imported the idea of remuneration, which would normally include a profit element, the appeal arbitrator was right to reject this.
The Court of Appeal agreed with the judge, so that "fair rate" was not to be a "salvage reward".
In the House of Lords, Lord Mustill also agreed that "fair rate" meant "fair rate of expenditure" and did not include any element of profit. 
(Because it was interpreting an international convention, the House of Lords had felt constrained to interpret its provisions "literally", rather than "purposively").
Significance.
Following on from the innovations of the LOF 1980, the 1989 International Salvage Convention permitted salvage rewards to be made to salvors who acted to limit damage to the coastal environment after oil spills. Articles 13 &amp; 14 of the Convention made provision for "Special Compensation", but "The Nagasaki Spirit" revealed that the Convention had been poorly drafted, thereby limiting the amount that environmental salvors could be paid to mere "out-of-pocket expenses", with no allowance for any profit margin. 
Not only the salvors in this case, but the entire salvage industry felt disappointed and let down by this case. As an antidote to this, the marine insurance industry and P&amp;I Clubs jointly developed the "SCOPIC clause", which is a codicil that may be appended to an LOF and invoked should the statutory payment provisions prove inadequate. The first SCOPIC clause was in 2000, and there have been several iterations since.

Sunk Costs (Better Call Saul)

"Sunk Costs" is the third episode of the third season of the AMC television series "Better Call Saul", the spinoff series of "Breaking Bad". The episode aired on April 24, 2017 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service Netflix in several countries. The title of the episode is a reference to sunk costs.
Plot.
After following his planted tracking device's signal to an empty stretch of highway, Mike finds it left in the middle of the road along with a ringing cell phone. He answers, agrees to the caller's request that no guns be displayed, and is told to wait for two cars to approach from opposite directions. The cars soon arrive, Gus exits one, and Gus and Mike discuss their concerns about Hector. They agree that Gus will no longer track Mike, and Mike will no longer try to kill Hector. Gus is amenable to Mike's continued disruption of Hector's drug business, and Mike suggests a way to draw police attention to Hector without killing him.
Mike acquires cocaine from Barry Goodman, stows it in a pair of sneakers, and throws them over a power line that spans part of the road in Mexico that he knows Hector's drug delivery trucks use. When the next truck comes, the drivers stop to stash their weapons prior to being searched at the border crossing. Using a rifle with a scope, Mike fires a few rounds into the air to give the drivers the false impression that there is a hunter or target shooter in the vicinity. As the truck pulls away, Mike fires at the sneaker holding the cocaine, which causes the powder to spill onto the back of the truck. At the border crossing, drug-sniffing dogs discover the cocaine, and the drivers are taken into custody.
Jimmy is arrested for breaking into Chuck's house. Following a few harsh but hesitant words with Chuck, Jimmy goes against Kim's advice and represents himself, pleads not guilty, and posts bail. Jimmy later explains to Kim the details of the break-in and tells her she should work on Mesa Verde business while he takes care of his own legal battle, to which she flatly agrees.
Kyra Hay, the prosecutor in Jimmy's case, meets with Chuck and tells him she does not plan to let Jimmy off easy. Chuck describes his wish to see a "better solution for everyone." Jimmy talks with Kim outside the Wexler-McGill office and informs her he can avoid jail time if he confesses to the break-in and submits his confession to the New Mexico Bar Association, which will likely result in disbarment. Kim changes her mind about helping Jimmy and persuades him to let her help fight Chuck's plan.

Detective Chinatown 2

Detective Chinatown 2 () is a 2018 Chinese comedy-mystery buddy film directed and written by Chen Sicheng, starring Wang Baoqiang and Liu Haoran. A sequel to 2015's "Detective Chinatown", the film was released in China on 16 February 2018. It has grossed over US$544 million worldwide, making it the fifth-highest-grossing film of all time in China.
A sequel, "Detective Chinatown 3", was released in February 2021.
Plot.
Qin Feng (Liu Haoran) thought he was going to attend his distant uncle Tang Ren's (Wang Baoqiang) wedding, which turned out to be a hoax. Tang Ren had deceived Qin Feng to come to New York for another purpose.
The godfather of Chinatown, Uncle Qi (Kenneth Tsang), gatheres the world's best detectives from an app called Crimaster (which allows real detectives to upload their cases for the online community to solve them) and sets up a competition to locate his grandson's killer within one week for a reward of five million dollars. His grandson Jason was found in a temple with his heart torn out and an unknown symbol on a table near him.
Unexpectedly, Qin Feng, the world's second-top detective and the world's third-top detective noticed another similar murder in the Hudson River one week before the investigation began. A white woman was also killed but lost her kidney. The two men pulled out surveillance videos of the two crime scenes and found that a man appeared at both crime scenes. They identify the man as Song Yi (Xiao Yang). However, after observing that Song Yi is right-handed, Qin Feng concludes that he could not be the killer since evidence suggests that the killer is left-handed. While Qin Feng and Tang Ren knew that Song Yi was not the killer, this was not everyone else's consensus, and so the duo had to clear Song Yi's name and find the real killer.
Eventually, with the help of Tang Ren's knowledge of Feng shui and "Wu Xing", Qin Feng discovered the killer's motive. Due to the unique location of the murders, the time of the crimes, the eight characters of the victims' birthdays and the organs, he concluded the whole of New York was being used as an altar.(the elements fire, water, wood, metal, and earth were used to determine the locations, date, and the respective organ to be removed)
Finally, they find out that the doctor who was battling cancer believed that doing ancient Taoist rituals could grant him immortality, and was behind the murders. The doctor kills himself after being found out.
Qin Feng deduces that Song Yi is actually the mysterious man "Q", the top-ranked detective of Crimaster. Song Yi solved the case very early on and used the doctor's patterns to cover up his own murder of a sex trafficking ringleader who abducted his sister. Qin Feng lets him go, but later KIKO reveals that "Q"'s IP address does not locate him in America, making Song Yi as "Q" unlikely. "Q" is therefore still at large.

John Wendell Mitchell

John Wendell Mitchell (1880–1951) was a Canadian author, best known for his work "The Yellow Briar: A Story of the Irish on the Canadian Countryside".
Early life.
Mitchell was born in 1880, in Mono Township, Ontario, in what is now part of Town of Mono. The area is occasionally figuratively referred to as the Caledon Hills, a reference to nearby Caledon Township, Ontario, now Caledon, Ontario. He lived on his grandfather's farm in Mono until 1894 when he moved with his mother to Toronto. He studied at Victoria College, before enrolling in Osgoode Hall Law School in 1902. He was called to the bar in 1907. He went on to practice law in Toronto for 28 years.
Writing career and The Yellow Briar deception.
Mitchell's first published work was "The Kingdom of America" (1930), an essay about Canada. In 1933 he published his first novel "The Yellow Briar" under the nom de plume Patrick Slater, about the experience of a poor Irish immigrant in Ontario. When it was originally published it was presented as an autobiography by the publisher. It was very popular, it was reprinted four times in 1934, eventually selling 10,000 copies at the height of the Great Depression. Even through it was eventually revealed, by The Globe, that Patrick Slater was a hoax and the work was entirely fictional it did not seem to effect the sales of the book.
Mitchell would go on to write two other novels "The Water-Drinker" (1937) and "Robert Harding" (1938), but was never able to match the success he had with "The Yellow Briar".
Fraud and disbarment.
In 1935 Mitchell confessed to police that he had fallen into debt and used his clients money to rescue himself, in the amount of $20,000. He made a public confession and insisted that he be charged. He was given a sentence of six months and served it at Langstaff jail farm, he was also disbarred. As a consequence printings of "The Yellow Briar" were discontinued.
Death.
Mitchell died in October 18, 1951 in poverty and relative obscurity. When his financial situation became public, after his death, a fund was set up to cover the cost of his grave marker.
Legacy.
"The Yellow Briar" was republished in 1970 by Macmillan Publishers, and again in 1990 by Dundurn Press, and it is currently in print.

Otto Kelmer

Otto Kelmer (, born 28 January 1948) is a German film director, author, artist, and psychoanalyst.
Life and work.
Otto Kelmer was born in Bucharest in 1948 and emigrated with his parents to Germany in 1963. From 1966 to 1967 he studied script writing and directing at the Filmacademy Vienna. In the autumn of 1967, he took up his studies at Ruhr University Bochum, majoring in psychology, specializing in media sciences, and finally earning his doctorate in 1975 with the publication "Television – Grandmaster of Violence?: The Unmasking of a Myth".
The German weekly newspaper "Die Zeit" offered Kelmer the opportunity to reach a wider audience through a full-page article in its cultural review. During this period Kelmer shot a number of shorts, including "CAGE", which was shown at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen in 1969.
In September 1979, German literary critic Marcel Reich-Ranicki published a selection of Kelmer's aphorisms in the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
From 1979 to 1985, Kelmer was introduced to classical drawing and painting by two Romanian artists based in Germany and France, Serban Gabrea and Daniel Négo. In 1980, Kelmer’s drawing "Uncontrolled multiplication of René Magritte" was shown by the curators Maurice Rapin and Mirabelle Dors at the "Salon Figuration Critique"/"Centre Culturel de la Rue du Louvre" in Paris.
After taking part in numerous group exhibitions at venues like Schloß Ringenberg Wesel in 1983 and Lehmbruck Museum in Duisburg in 1984, Kelmer was invited to exhibit his installation "Tantalus' Dining Room" at the avantgarde Galerie Löhrl in Mönchengladbach.
As well as pursuing his artistic activities, Kelmer completed his training as a psychoanalyst from 1982 to 1991 with professors Tobias Brocher and Edeltrud Meistermann-Seeger, both known for their unorthodox role in further developing the theory and practice of psychoanalysis.
Kelmer advanced his film studies under the mentorship of directors like Krzysztof Zanussi and Krzysztof Kieślowski as well as screenwriter Frank Daniel. Between 1991 and 1992, Kelmer wrote and directed the partly authentic, partly fictional "The Secret Collection of Salvador Dalí" for the German television channel ZDF. The film received numerous national and international accolades including the Grimme Award, the audience Award of the Marler Group for the best TV production of 1992, and the Prix du Jury at the International Festival of Films on Art FIFA in Montréal in 1994.
For the Dalí film, Kelmer created, among other art works, the sculpture "Narcissistic Triptych or Mirroring Apollo", which has since been exhibited in the Film Museum Düsseldorf. The film was shown twice in the Centre Pompidou in Paris: in 1994 at the 4e Biennale Internationale du Film sur l´Art and in 2013 as part of the Salvador Dalí retrospective, curated by Jean-Hubert Martin.
As part of the exhibition "Charade – Rochade" at the Haubrok Collection Berlin in 2012, Kelmer's trailer for a not-yet-existing film was one of the most excitedly received and discussed exhibits.

Poems of tribute were published in the New Orleans Tribune including one with a stanza noting Lacroix. After his death a séance was held and the medium reported that Lacroix sought a continued push for civil rights.
Four years before his death, Lacroix married Sarah Brown, a white woman, in a religious ceremony at St. Alphonse Church. Civil law prohibited such a marriage until 1868 years after his death. In a contestation of Lacroix's will, Brown gave testimony that she did not realize her husband was a man of color until after they were wed. Ultimately, a filing deadline was missed and her case was denied. She and her two young children with Lacroix were provided for by her father-in-law, François Lacroix, a wealthy property owner and tailor.

Nokia 8 Sirocco

The Nokia 8 Sirocco (TA-1005) is a high-end smartphone running the Android One variant of Android. It was introduced at MWC in February 2018, and named after the Nokia 8800 Sirocco. The successor of the Nokia 8 Sirocco is the Nokia 9 PureView.
Specifications.
Hardware.
Compared to the original Nokia 8, the Sirocco edition uses a glass body with stainless steel instead of aluminium. It also has a new camera, a fingerprint sensor at the back instead of the front, 6 GB of RAM instead of 4 GB, omission of the CTIA headphone jack in favour of USB-C, a 5.5" OLED screen rather than a 5.3" LCD, Qi wireless charging, and a larger battery capacity. The device has a Snapdragon 835 like its predecessor.
The display is curved, but the phone lacks palm rejection technology which is found in other curved smartphones. The 8 Sirocco is the very first Nokia device featuring IP67 water resistance, which was never found in earlier Nokia phones including Lumia series.
Software.
The Nokia 8 Sirocco ships with Android Oreo and can be updated to Android 10.
Reception.
The Nokia 8 Sirocco received mixed to positive reviews. Daniel Van Boom of "CNET" praised the device, stating that "The Nokia 8 Sirocco is fast, feels sturdy, has a long battery life and runs the sleek Android One operating system." while noting that "It lacks any standout features to justify its premium pricing. The Nokia 8 Sirocco's camera isn't reliable enough, and its design, while improved over the regular Nokia 8, feels stout and a little outdated". Sandra Vogel of "ZDNet" also praised the phone’s "Solid steel frame, Android One ensuring 2 years of updates, 128GB of internal storage and IP67 rating for dust/water resistance" while criticising the "poor implementation of a curved screen and 16:9 ratio display".

The Universim

The Universim is an Indie, Simulation God-style video game developed by Crytivo Games, in which the player takes the role of God and guides the development of civilization through the ages. Development started in April 2014. It is planned to be released on Microsoft Windows, MacOS and Linux. It was released in early access for Steam August 28, 2018.
Synopsis.
The Universim is a planet management game where the player takes the role of "God" and guides the development of civilization. Each planet is randomly generated and can be colonised given enough time and technology. Initially the game starts in the Stone Age where the player needs to build basic shelters and invent fire. Buildings and society evolve as civilization progresses unlocking new buildings and technologies. Firstly an Epicentre must be built and other buildings will be developed around it. Standard housing is built automatically but the location of special buildings like Power Plants and Farms has to be specified by the player. Resources such as food, clothing and power must be managed in order to speed up development, survive long winters and cope with natural disasters. Eventually you can guide your civilisation past the Modern era to the Space era where it is possible to colonise other planets and harvest valuable resources from these planets.
Each planet on Universim is dynamic and evolves throughout the game. There is weather simulation including changing seasons and natural disasters. Meteor crashes and forest fires can wreak havoc upon your civilisation and long winters can slow development. Many planets have alien inhabitants, some are friendly but others are not and have to be defended against. Your citizens, known as "Nuggets", have the ability to make their own decisions and do things their own way, this can create dangerous problems and even lead to wars which the player can attempt to stop. As well as managing development the player also has to keep their civilisation loyal and under control. The players influence is based on two elements which are Power and Wrath. Power comes from successful completion of tasks and allows the player to alter the world e.g. change the weather. Wrath is generated when the Nuggets fail to complete tasks, this allows the player to unleash destruction on the world to scare the Nuggets into action.
Development.
In April 2014, Crytivo Games started their Kickstarter for Universim aiming to raise $320,000 which was successful with them raising a total of $387,345.
On June 13, 2014, PayPal put a minimum reserve of $1 million on the Crytivo Games account which meant none of their funds could be accessed until their account reached a balance of $1 million. By May 15, 2015, they took to Twitter in an attempt to break PayPal's silence and access their pledged funds.
In June 2015, Crytivo Games brought The Universim to E3 to advertise the game and get feedback from the public.
A Pre-alpha version of the game was released on September 15, 2015 and was available to anyone who bought access to the alpha tier of the game. This preview included a mainly spectator version of the game where players could explore a planet and construct several different buildings. The total gameplay time was about 20 minutes. On August 2, 2016, the alpha version was released after a major update. The alpha version includes more control over the population (referred to as "Nuggets"); most of the Stone Age buildings and mechanics are present, some in-depth functionality like injuries and healthcare are in place, and in-game tutorials were added.
As of October 2017, development of the Medieval era started which included new buildings and technologies.
As of December 2018, development of the Modern era started which included new buildings and technologies.
The Universim is designed using a custom engine referred to as Prometheus, which in turn is based upon the Unity Engine.

Eodelphinus

Eodelphinus is an extinct genus of oceanic dolphins belonging to the family Delphinidae.
Description.
"Eodelphinus" differs from all other delphinids by having a medially positioned premaxillary foramen, a partially transversely directed suture line between the palatine and pterygoid on the palate, and prominently long and ventrolaterally extended posterior process of the periotic with the attenuating posterior bullar facet. It possesses a wide ascending process of the left premaxilla relative to the right premaxilla at level of the middle of the external nares as in the killer whale and "Hemisyntrachelus".
Taxonomy.
"Eodelphinus" was originally described in 1977 as a new species of "Stenella", "S. kabatensis", from a partial skull found in marine deposits in Hokkaido, Japan. Later, Ichisima (2005) questioned the attribution of "S. kabatensis" to "Stenella", stressing the need for re-assessment of the taxon. Subsequent study by Mizuki Murakami and colleagues published in 2014 showed that "S. kabatensis" is the most basal member of Delphinidae, necessitating erection of the new genus "Eodelphis". However, the genus name was changed to "Eodelphinus" because "Eodelphis" was already used for a fossil opossum.

The Vice-President of the Council of State () is the "de facto" presiding officer of the Council of State. The Monarch serves as "ex officio" President of the Council of State but in reality seldom chairs meetings, in his absence the Vice-President serves as "pro tempore" chair of those meetings. The Vice-President is also in charge of the Council's organisation and administrative duties. The Constitution of the Netherlands stipulates that if the royal house were to become extinct the Vice-President will become the acting Head of state. Like the other Members of the Council of State the Vice President is appointed by the Monarch upon nomination by the Minister of the Interior and Kingdom Relations. The service of the Vice-President is a life tenure appointment but is required by law to enter a mandatory retirement at the age of 70. Alternatively, an early retirement or a forced termination of his tenure can be given by the Monarch in a Royal Decree.
The current Vice-President of the Council of State is Thom de Graaf.

Tirnawannagh

Tirnawannagh () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Tirnawannagh is bounded on the north by Prospect, Corlough townland, on the south by Teeboy and Gortnacargy townlands, on the west by Arderry and Moneynure townlands and on the east by Derrymony and Erraran townlands. Its chief geographical features are Brackley Lough, Bunerky Lough (Irish = Loch Bun Adhairc = The Lake of the Butt of the Horn), Lough Namoyle (Loch na Maoile = The Lake of the Bare Hill), forestry plantations, small streams, a spring and dug wells. Tirnawannagh is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 340 statute acres.
History.
In medieval times the McGovern barony of Tullyhaw was divided into economic taxation areas called ballibetoes, from the Irish "Baile Biataigh" (Anglicized as 'Ballybetagh'), meaning 'A Provisioner's Town or Settlement'. The original purpose was to enable the farmer, who controlled the baile, to provide hospitality for those who needed it, such as poor people and travellers. The ballybetagh was further divided into townlands farmed by individual families who paid a tribute or tax to the head of the ballybetagh, who in turn paid a similar tribute to the clan chief. The steward of the ballybetagh would have been the secular equivalent of the erenagh in charge of church lands. There were seven ballibetoes in the parish of Templeport. Tirnawannagh was located in the ballybetagh of "Bally Gortnekargie" (Irish "Gort na Carraige", meaning 'The Field of the Rock'). 
The 1609 Ulster Plantation Baronial Map depicts the townland as part of "Gortnacargie" (now the modern townland of Gortnacargy in Corlough parish).
The 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as "Terrynownagh".
William Petty's 1685 map depicts the townland as "Terenowna".
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, King James VI and I granted the "lands of Gortnekargie containing 4 polls, Dowrie containing 1 poll and Corneha containing 1 poll comprising a total of 300 acres at an annual rent of £3-4s., to John O’Reily and Connor O’Reily, gentlemen". John O’Reily and Connor O’Reily seem to be the great-great grandsons of the chief of the O'Reilly clan, Eamón mac Maolmórdha O’Reilly of Kilnacrott, who ruled East Breifne from October 1596 – 1601. Their genealogy is "Conchobhar &amp; Seaán sons of Cathaoir Óg son of Aodh son of Cathaoir son of Eamón of Kilnacrott son of Maolmórdha son of Seaán son of Cathal".
By a deed dated 10 May 1611 between "the said Connor McCahir O’Relly of Cargeagh-Callne in County Cavan, gent and John O’Relly of Gortingarge, County Cavan, gent by which they divide between them the 6 poules of land gotten at the last Plantation of the county, viz, the poules of Gortinesimonie, Tirenavan, Dinrewelle, Dune, Dongary and Cornahagh, of which Connor obtained the three first; who is to pay John 10 shillings English yearly in satisfaction of a gallon of land".
An Inquisition held at Cavan Town on 31 March 1626 found that the said "Cornelius O’Rely, recently of Gortincarge, County Cavan deceased, was seized of said townland of Gortincarge containing 4 polls of land, namely Gortinshemore, Downe and Tyrenewonagh and 2 polls of land in Downe and Corneha. He died on 3 November 1625. His daughter and heir Mor O’Rely was then 15 years old and married".
The aforesaid O'Reilly lands in Tirnawannagh were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows-
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey depicts the townland as "Teernenooan" with the proprietor being "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford". 
A deed dated 13 Nov 1738 includes: "Teernannanagh". 
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Teernevanagh".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list fourteen tithepayers in the townland.
The Tirnawannagh Valuation Office Field books are available for October 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 131, being 56 males and 75 females. There were twenty-two houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 72, being 34 males and 38 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were seventeen houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty-two landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 74, being 37 males and 37 females. There were sixteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 74, being 35 males and 39 females. There were sixteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 76, being 35 males and 41 females. There were twelve houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 64, being 29 males and 35 females. There were twelve houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are fifteen families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland, there are fourteen families listed in the townland.

Haint blue

Haint blue is a collection of pale shades of blue-green that are traditionally used to paint porch ceilings in the southern United States.
The tradition originated with the Gullah in Georgia and South Carolina. The ceiling of the slave quarters at the Owens–Thomas House in Savannah, Georgia, built in the early nineteenth century, was painted haint blue. The pigment was sourced from crushed indigo plants. Indigo was a common source for haint blue prior to the American Revolution, when indigo was a common crop for plantations in the American South, but the tradition survived well after the decline in indigo cultivation.
Etymology.
The word "haint" is an alternative spelling of "haunt", which was historically used in African-American vernacular to refer to a ghost or, in the Hoodoo belief, a witch-like creature seeking to chase victims to their death by exhaustion.
Purpose.
Originally, haint blue was thought by the Gullah to ward haints, or ghosts, away from the home. The tactic was intended either to mimic the appearance of the sky, tricking the ghost into passing through, or to mimic the appearance of water, which ghosts traditionally could not cross. The Gullah would paint not only the porch, but also doors, window frames, and shutters. Blue glass bottles were also hung in trees to trap haints and Boo Hags. But while enslaved Africans of the Lowcountry and their descendants believed in the protective power of haint blue, the cultivation of indigo to produce the dye energized the 18th-century transatlantic slave trade, thereby increasing the enslavement of Africans.
As Gullah culture mingled with white southern culture, the custom became more widely practiced. The use of haint blue has lost some of its superstitious significance, but modern proponents also cite the color as a spider and wasp-deterrent. However, the color has not actually been scientifically shown to stave off bugs. The associated repellent effect may stem from the use of milk paint containing lye, which does act as an insect repellent. The blue color is also appreciated from an aesthetic standpoint for mimicking the color of the sky.

Shooting of Anthony Weber

On February 4, 2018, Anthony Weber, a 16-year-old African-American male, was fatally shot by deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department in Westmont, California. Deputies came to the scene because they received a 911 call. The caller claimed someone had pointed a gun at him. The deputies claimed that Weber reached into his waistband so they shot him over ten times. Deputies did not find a gun on Weber.
Aftermath.
Days after the shooting amid rising tension in the community, a meeting was called between the Sheriff's department and the community. At the meeting, tensions were high between members of the community and law enforcement. Members of the Weber family demanded to see the gun. John Weber, Anthony's older brother, asked Captain Chris Bergner if the family and community were "due something?" Bergner replied: "absolutely not." The meeting ended in jeers after the response. The next day, Bergner claimed he could not hear the question and thought the question was "Don't you think we are doomed?" Xavier Thompson, a member of an oversight commission, responded: "We will not settle for spin." Los Angeles County announced a settlement with Weber's family for $3.75 million in May 2019.
Reaction.
Family.
Weber's family were upset as his body remained in the street uncovered for hours after the shooting. Chris Bergner from the Sheriff's department, claimed that Weber was "a local gang member in the area," but Weber's father has denied that allegation. The Weber family also denied the allegation that Weber was armed with a gun.
Members of the family and local activists have demanded an independent investigation by the California Attorney General's office. Najee Ali, speaking for the Weber family, said "Last night's sheriff's meeting was outrageous and a waste of time." She went on: "The family, as well as many civil rights leaders, feel no trust in the Sheriff's Department to investigate their own. That's why today the family, along with civil rights leaders, are calling upon California's Attorney General Javier Becerra to investigate."
Protests.
After the shooting, activists in Los Angeles protested the shooting of Weber. Activists from Black Lives Matter have protested Weber's death. During 2018 NBA All-Star Game weekend, activists continued to protest Weber's death.
Sheriff's department.
The day after the shooting, the Sheriff's department had a press conference at the Hall of Justice. The Sheriff's department played the 911 call that brought deputies to the scene. Bergner defended the actions of the deputies involved in the shooting and characterized Weber as a gang member. The Sheriff's department claims the gun may have been taken.
A week after the shooting, Jim McDonnell (sheriff) acknowledged the possibility that Weber was not armed when he was shot.

Eldorado (poetry collection)

Eldorado is a volume of poetry by Dutch poet J. Slauerhoff. First published in 1928, the collection gathers poems that speak mostly of sailors' and pirates' lives and desires. The poems contain familiar themes for Slauerhoff: a sailor's life, the impossibility of life on land or in society, the myth of the pirate and the "Flying Dutchman".
Content.
"Flying Dutchman" motif.
Three of the poems address the myth of the "Flying Dutchman", though literary critic H. T. J. Miedema wrote in an overview article of the myth in the 1950s that Slauerhoff is "less of a "poète maudit" fighting against God" than some of his contemporaries who used the theme. The theme was familiar to Slauerhoff, who had written a "Flying Dutchman" poem already before 1922. Whereas other Dutch poets were inspired more by German Romanticism (particularly Richard Wagner's "Der fliegende Holländer", based on a short story by Heinrich Heine), Slauerhoff arrived by way of French poets who treated the related themes of the eternal ghost ship and the dead albatross. For instance, his Rimbaud-inspired "Het eeuwige schip" had been published in 1925 already, and before 1922 he had translated Charles Baudelaire's "L'Albatros". Literary critic S. P. Uri considers "Spookschip", which makes no overt reference to the theme, a better poem than "The vliegende Hollander"; like his other poems that treat the theme implicitly, it is a "strong visionary and symbolic poem, filled with typical Romantic feelings of demise, death, and decomposition". By contrast, he treats the theme in the overt "Flying Dutchman" almost satirically, in "forced language and sloppy rhymes". Uri surmises that perhaps Slauerhoff, who was never interested in "typical Dutch fare", chose to focus on the French Romantic aspects of the myth rather than the Dutch, Calvinist ones.
Tristan Corbière.
Corbière is cited as one of Slauerhoff's influences and in his early years he had identified with the French "poète maudit".
Publishing history.
First published in 1928 by C. A. J. van Dishoeck in Bussum, it was printed twice more by the same publisher (1942, 1946). It was published (unchanged) in 1982 by Nijgh &amp; Van Ditmar as part of Slauerhoff's collected poetic works.
Critical responses.
J. C. Bloem (in "De Gids", 1929) compared the poem "Afrikaansche elegy" ("African elegy"), which opens the second section, with the work of Charles Baudelaire (esp. "Parfum Exotique"); Bloem made his comparison in an overview of new Dutch poets whose "raw, jarring, and purposely unpolished" poetry had its flaws but was a welcome change from over-stylized predecessors. Raymond Herreman ("Den Gulden Winckel", 1929) praised Slauerhoff for being a young Dutch poets who reacts strongly against two different tendencies he saw in contemporary poetry—a "verbose and hollow romanticism" that attempted to ingest the entire cosmos and was ready to explode, and a school that childishly inflated the tiniest psychological imbalance to inner drama. "Eldorado", according to Herreman, was a breath of fresh air with verses full of violence and warmth, and on the whole expressed a deep desire to grasp life at its fullest. Poet and critic Nico Donkersloot noted that the glory days of Dutch lyric poetry seemed to have passed, and while praising Slauerhoff as the greatest poet of his generation said "Eldorado" was disappointing, possibly because of high expectations.
Hendrik Marsman, a fellow poet and critic, wrote a highly favorable review; in 1931, he wrote that of all contemporary poets Slauerhoff most closely exhibited the "original life force of the formative beginning, of the poetic force". He admired the apparent struggle between the formal, poetic power, whose desire is to express itself using the highest human faculty (language), a poetic power that is at the same time "thwarted, undermined, misled, and poisoned by nature".

The Sprint Cup Series team was founded in 1990 as Phoenix Racing by Florida businessman James Finch, and named for his business Phoenix Construction. The organization as currently constituted was formed when Harry Scott purchased Finch's Cup Series team in late 2013, and then took over the Xfinity and K&amp;N Pro Series operations of TSM following the 2014 season. In the Sprint Cup Series, the team last fielded the No. 15 5-Hour Energy/Aaron's/Visine/PEAK Chevrolet SS full-time for Clint Bowyer and the No. 46 Pilot Flying J SS full-time for Michael Annett. Scott also fielded several teams in the K&amp;N Pro Series East in a partnership with driver Justin Marks, winning the 2015 and 2016 Championships. The Xfinity Series program has since been moved to Chip Ganassi Racing.
The team sold their charter in December 2016 and eventually shut down the Cup and K&amp;N teams for 2017. Months later, on August 2, 2017, Harry Scott Jr. died.
Sprint Cup Series.
Car No. 15 history.
Following sponsorship struggles, longtime Phoenix Racing owner James Finch sold his Spartanburg, South Carolina-based operation to Harry Scott Jr. in mid-2013, with Finch's last race as an owner at the Atlanta Labor Day Event in September. Scott continued to use the No. 51, Finch's longtime car number.
Ryan Truex, who had driven for Phoenix at Bristol earlier in the year, drove Scott's first race as owner at Richmond, finishing 35th (With sponsor SeaWatch Intl.). Although the team used the old Phoenix Racing number font for the first race, for his second race Scott's ownership was displayed by changing the paint scheme and number style of the car to match those used by Turner Scott Motorsports (Scott's Xfinity series team at the time). In addition, on February 5, 2014, Scott announced that Phoenix Racing would be renamed HScott Motorsports.
Scott's Nationwide Series driver Justin Allgaier drove the car with Brandt Agricultural sponsorship at Chicagoland, Kansas, Talladega and Phoenix.
Kyle Larson, Allgaier's teammate at Turner Scott who was set to take over the No. 42 car the next year at Chip Ganassi Racing, drove the car at Charlotte, Martinsville and Homestead with an inverted white and red Target scheme. He also drove at Texas with Visitdallas.com on the car.
Larson started 21st at Charlotte, but a late engine failure relegated him to a 37th-place finish. Michael McDowell would run the car at New Hampshire (Finished 30th with sponsor SEM Products), and Truex made his third start for the team at his home track Dover (Finished 32nd with sponsor Shooters Sporting Center). Allgaier would have a best finish of 24th at Talladega, while Larson would have the team's best finish a 15th at Homestead, while also leading the team's first lap.
The team announced following the season that Allgaier would drive the No. 51 and compete for Rookie of the Year honors in 2014 with crew chief Steve Addington. Allgaier finished third in the ROTY standings behind Kyle Larson and Austin Dillon and 29th in the standings. His best finish was 15th at Charlotte and Homestead. The team failed to qualify for a single race, the GEICO 500 at Talladega in the fall, due to an unusual qualifying session that also saw another full-time driver also miss the race. The team had Brandt as the primary sponsor for 22 races with Scott's Accu-Doc Solutions being the sponsor for 5 races. The team had sponsors Auto-Owners Insurance, Sherwin-Williams, SEM Products, HendrickCars.com, Carcoon Airflow, Collision Cure Body Werks and Visitdallas.com filling in the rest of the schedule.
Allgaier returned to the team in 2015, with Brandt continuing to sponsor the team. He successfully qualified for the first two races of the season. Allgaier crashed during the 2015 Daytona 500 but rebounded a few weeks later at Phoenix. He was lapped on lap 56 during the 2015 Camping World.com 500 at Phoenix. Despite this, thanks to a strategy call by crew chief Addington, Allgaier got back onto the lead lap and raced his way into the top ten by the time there were 35 laps to go. After contact with Tony Stewart, Allgaier faded in the final 5 laps, finishing 18th. The next week at Fontana, he repeated his Phoenix performance, running as high as 8th and finishing 12th-his best finish at the time. A few weeks later, at Bristol, Allgaier ran well all race, even up in the top 5 at one point. Allgaier ended up finishing 8th, his first Cup top 10, and the first for HScott Motorsports as well. The team's good performance started to fade during the summer and Allgaier finished 30th in points. Also sponsoring the 51 that season was Auto-Owners Insurance, FOE.com, Switch Hitch, Accu-Doc Solutions, SEM products, TradeMark Nitrogen, Flipping Ships, and Texas Lottery.
Parting ways with HScott Motorsports after the 2015 season, Allgaier took Brandt and returned to the Xfinity Series for JR Motorsports in 2016. Clint Bowyer was tabbed as Allgaier's replacement as Bowyer was a free agent due to his team Michael Waltrip Racing shutting doors after the 2015 season. Bowyer brought sponsorship from 5-hour Energy, Visine, Aaron's and PEAK with him as well as the number 15. Scott's own Accu-Doc Solutions was on the car for 4 races. This was a temporary one-season move for Bowyer, as a holdout before moving to Stewart-Haas Racing for 2017. The team struggled early in the season when the expected help from SHR never materialized.
Despite having a rough start to the season, Bowyer turned things around in April when he finished 8th at Bristol. He then finished 7th at Talladega, the best finish for HSM and later followed that with a 9th at Daytona. Even with the terrible start to the season, Bowyer would finish 27th in points (The 15 was 28th in Owner points).
After the season ended, Bowyer announced that he would be suing HScott Motorsports for $2.2 million in prize money and commission. Both parties would settle the dispute a week later. On December 5, with no viable sponsor/driver options for 2017, Harry Scott announced that he had sold the No. 15 charter to Premium Motorsports and closed his operation. One of HScott's cars from the No. 15 team was later purchased by MBM Motorsports in the off-season, in which MBM would use it to participate as a part-time team in the 2017 season.
Car No. 46 history.
It was announced prior to the 2014 season that former Phoenix Racing owner James Finch would return to field a part-time entry numbered 52 with HScott for Bobby Labonte, beginning with the Daytona 500. Labonte ran the second HScott car during preseason Daytona testing using Scott's TSM number style, then used Finch's traditional Phoenix Racing number style and paint scheme during the Daytona 500. The team picked up sponsorship from the Florida Lottery, and Labonte finished a solid 15th. The team did not run the rest of the season.
In late January 2015 Michael Annett brought his longtime primary sponsor Pilot Flying J, as well as sponsors Cypress Associates, Allstate Peterbilt, Northland Oil &amp; Lubricants, Switch Hitch, Sherwin-Williams, TMC Transportation, Multiprens USA and EFS (Electronic Funds Source), to drive a second HSM car full-time after running his rookie season with Tommy Baldwin Racing. The car number was later revealed to be No. 46 and Jay Guy was announced as crew chief. Annett finished 13th at the season-opening Daytona 500. He failed to qualify for next race at Atlanta, one of 13 drivers to not pass inspection and set a time during qualifying. Shortly after, HScott was given a second chance after Xfinity Series regular Brian Scott gave up his seat in the No. 33 Circle Sport Racing Chevrolet. The car was wrapped in Pilot Flying J colors, and Circle Sport owner Joe Falk was credited with owner's points under NASCAR rules. During the 2015 season, Annett had a rough season and he also missed the fall Talladega race. Other than Daytona, Annett's best finish was 23rd at Bristol, Kansas and Martinsville. Annett finished 36th in points with the 46 finishing 38th in Owner points.
Annett returned for 2016, with primary sponsorship from Pilot Flying J and sponsorship from Allstate Peterbilt, Northland Oil &amp; Lubricants, Multiprens USA and EFS (Electronic Funds Source). At Watkins Glen, the 46 featured the St. Jude Iowa Tournament of Hope. HScott entering into an agreement for a short-term lease of Premium Motorsports' charter, guaranteeing a starting spot for the team and Annett in every race. In July, HSM in an attempt to improve performance hired Mike Hillman Jr. as the 46's crew chief. Annett missed the August Bristol race due to flu-like symptoms and was replaced by Justin Allgaier, who finished 40th after a crash. Annett and HSM struggled all season with a best finish of 20th in July at Daytona and they finished 36th in points. On November 5, Annett and his sponsors announced that they were leaving HSM for JR Motorsports in 2017. HScott Motorsports would shut down in December.
Xfinity Series.
HScott Motorsports with Chip Ganassi.
Car No. 42 history.
Following financial issues with co-owner Steve Turner that led to the dissolution of Turner Scott Motorsports, Scott found a new partner in the team, Chip Ganassi (whose drivers Kyle Larson and Dylan Kwasniewski drove for TSM), to field a single Xfinity Series entry under the name HScott Motorsports with Chip Ganassi. The team (led by crew chief Mike Shiplett) ran out of the Chip Ganassi Racing shop, with Larson, Brennan Poole, and Justin Marks sharing the ride. Kwasniewski did not return to the team due to lack of sponsorship. Larson began with an eighth-place finish at the season opener at Daytona. Poole made his Xfinity Series debut at Las Vegas, finishing 9th. The team had some struggles during this season, but Larson managed to win the season finale at Homestead, after leading 118 laps and passing Austin Dillon with four laps to go. Larson had sponsorship during the season from Eneos (8 races), ParkerStore (2 races), Crest (2 races), Accu-Doc Solutions and Dixie Chopper/Big Machine Records. Larson would also finish the season with four Top 5s and nine Top 10s while leading 175 laps. Poole would run 17 races with DC Solar sponsorship and he had Top 10s at Las Vegas (9th) and Loudon (10th). Marks would run the road course races at Mid-Ohio (Linksys sponsored, finished 15th) and Road America (Ganassi Sound Garage sponsored, finished 7th). The 42 would finish 15th in Owners points.
The team became fully operated by Ganassi for 2016.
K&amp;N Pro Series.
For 2015, Harry Scott Jr. took control of the K&amp;N Pro Series East operation of the now-defunct Turner Scott Motorsports. Scott partnered with Justin Marks to field five Chevrolet teams under the name HScott Motorsports with Justin Marks with returning driver Scott Heckert (#34 Project Lifesaver) and rookies William Byron (#9 Liberty University), J. J. Haley (#5 Braun Auto), and Dalton Sargeant (#51 Galt). Following his win at the Chili Bowl Midget Nationals, 22-year-old Rico Abreu was signed to drive the team's 98 car (Accu-Doc Solutions/GoPro Motorplex) in January 2015. Byron scored four wins and three poles en route to the 2015 series championship. Heckert (2 wins/2 poles) finished 2nd in points, Sargeant finished 4th in points, Abreu (1 win/3 poles) finished 5th in points and Haley finished 6th in points.
2015 featured HScott Motorsports with Justin Marks sending three Chevrolet teams (#52 Galt- Dalton Sargeant, #91 Liberty University- William Byron, #05 Braun Auto Group- J.J. Haley) to compete in the K&amp;N Pro Series West at Sonoma and Phoenix. Respectively Sargeant would finish 2nd/4th, Byron would finish 5th/2nd and Haley would finish 3rd/21st along with winning the pole at Phoenix.
In 2016, the East program added Harrison Burton, the son of "NASCAR on NBC" commentator and former driver Jeff Burton, who began driving the No. 12 DEX Imaging/Konica Minolta Chevrolet for the team.
The team added Tyler Dippel (#38 East West Marine/TyCar) and Hunter Baize (#13 Bicycle Playing Cards/Pine Mountain Firelogs), who competed for Rookie of the Year alongside Burton. Haley (#5 Braun Auto Group) returned in 2016 and ended the year as the 2016 series champion after winning two races, two poles with 13 Top 5s and finishing in the top ten in all 14 races, the only driver to do so in series history. Dippel (1 win) finished 3rd in points, Baize finished 4th in points and Burton (1 pole) finished 7th in points.
On December 5, 2016, HScott Motorsports announced that with no viable driver/sponsor options for 2017 that it was closing its Cup operation. In conjunction with that the K&amp;N operation also shut down.
ARCA Racing Series.
In 2015, HSM would field J.J. Haley in a limited schedule in the No. 74 Braun Auto Group/BraunAbility Chevrolet in the ARCA Racing Series. He would run at IRP and twice at Salem Speedway. The team's best start was a 2nd at Salem with a best finish of 4th happening at Salem and IRP.

Alfred Le Chatelier

Frédéric Alfred Le Chatelier (23 November 1855 – 9 August 1929) was a French soldier, ceramicist and Islamologist.
He spent most of his military career in the French African colonies. 
After leaving the army he was involved in a project to build a railway in the French Congo. 
He fought a duel and killed his opponent over mutual accusations of improper conduct concerning the Congo railways. 
He founded and ran a ceramics workshop for a few years before becoming a professor of Islamic Sociology at the Collège de France from 1902 to 1925.
He exerted considerable influence over French policy towards the Muslim subjects of France's colonial empire, arguing for policy based on solidly documented facts, and for tolerance and sympathy to the rapidly changing Muslim societies.
Early years (1855–76).
Frédéric Alfred Le Chatelier was born on 12 November 1855 in Paris at 84 rue de Vaugirard in the center of a district of art and ceramic studios.
He was one of seven children of the prominent railway engineer Louis Le Chatelier (1815–1873) and Louise Madeleine Élisabeth Durand (1827–1902).
His family was wealthy and well-connected.
His brother was the future chemist Henry Louis Le Chatelier.
Although interested in natural sciences, Alfred chose to join the army and attended the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr
He obtained his diploma in 1874 and degree in 1876.
He was brilliant, visionary, entrepreneurial and domineering, a convinced republican and secularist.
He was unable to maintain a long-term friendship.
Military career (1876–93).
After leaving Saint-Cyr in 1876 Le Chatelier was an "officier des affaires indigénes" in Algeria for ten years.
In 1880 he was an assistant topographer on the first Flatters expedition.
This mission set out on January 1880 to explore a route for a trans-Saharan railway.
At Touggourt Le Chatelier advised Paul Flatters not to accept the offer of a "muqaddam" to accompany the mission, since his religious prestige might undermine the authority of Flatters.
This caused a furious response from Flatters, who possibly felt his competence was being questioned.
Relations between the French and Arab members of the expedition were uneasy from the start.
At Aïn Taïba, eight days south of Ouargla, Le Chatelier tried to retrieve some water skins the cameleers had taken from the French.
The Arabs at once cocked their rifles and took position behind a dune, and the French did the same.
Flatters temporarily resolved the problem by relieving Le Chatelier of his command.
The mission reached Lake Menghough on the fringe of the Tuareg of the Ajjer country, then returned in May 1880.
When the second Flatters expedition was being organized later in 1880 Le Chatelier was among the members of the first expedition who asked for other assignments.
Le Chatelier was head of the French post among the Mekhedma tribe of the Sud-Oranais, where he taught them what he called "republican principles".
As the rebellion of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh died down, the itinerant marabouts of the Awlad Sidi Shaykh turned to rebuilding their business, demanding donations to their shrine from the peasants, who still thought they had strong influence with God.
Le Chatelier succeeded in convincing the local people that they need not pay the tribute.
He was promoted to "chef de bureau" of Ouargla from 1882 to 1885.
Colonel André de Saint-Germain taught him the old school Arab Bureaux principles of administration in which the "chef de bureau" was administrator, advocate and judge of the indigenous people.
Le Chatelier opened a school, had wells dug, improved sanitation, established a court and met regularly with the local elders.
Between 1886 and 1890 Le Chatelier served with a regiment in France but was allowed to travel widely in Morocco, West Africa, Egypt and Turkey.
In 1886 the governor general of Algeria charged him with a mission in Upper Egypt and in 1889–90 he undertook a five-month mission in Morocco.
Le Chatelier wrote several books and brochures for the African section of the État-major général which had great influence on Paul Marty, who would later write at length about Islam in West Africa.
Le Chatelier gained deep knowledge of Islamic societies in the Middle East and North Africa, and came to believe that the French fear of Pan-Islamic conspiracies had no foundation.
In 1887 Le Chatelier wrote "Les Confréries Musulmanes de Hijaz", a useful and scholarly monograph that showed the importance in Africa of the Sufi brotherhoods.
He said they were not organized associations or secret societies, and individuals followed different shaykhs, but all African Muslims saw themselves as either Qadiriyya or Tijaniyyah.
He discussed the Sufi origins of the jihads of Futa Tooro, Fouta Djallon and Sokoto.
Le Chatelier wrote a complete draft of "L'islam dans l'Afrique occidentale" in 1888, which was finally published in 1899.
The book had the pragmatic goal of studying Islam to inform political action.
He believed that systematic research into Islam was essential, rather than periodical reports or personal views.
Policy towards Islam should be reserved, tolerant, attentive and active, and should not be overbearing or aggressive.
In 1890–91 Le Chatelier was a member of the Minister of War Charles de Freycinet's cabinet with the mandate of monitoring debates in the Chamber of Deputies.
He became the acquaintance or friend of many rising officials and politicians including Eugène Étienne, future head of the parliamentary colonial group, and Paul Révoil, future governor-general of Algeria.
Freycinet arranged for Le Chatelier to take a year's leave to study Islam in Africa, and he spent time in Dahomey and the French Congo.
He returned to Paris hoping he could convince the government to support the approach to Africans he had proven in Ouargla.
He gained no support, and on 14 April 1893 resigned from the army.
Congo (1893–96).
Le Chatelier was a charter member of the Comité de l'Afrique française, a lobby group that was becoming active in the French Congo.
In the Spring of 1893 Le Chatelier founded the Société d'études et d'explorations du Congo français (Company for Study and Exploration of the French Congo) to create a railway link from the coast to the interior.
Le Chatelier invested much of his personal fortune in the railway scheme, and suffered great loss when the government came out in favour of a rival project headed by Harry Alis, another founding member of the Comité de l'Afrique française.
On 2 March 1895 Le Chatelier fought a duel at the Moulin Rouge restaurant in Neuilly with Harry Alis (Léon Hippolyte Percher), editor of the "Journal des débats".
The duel was fought with swords over a charge that Le Châtelier had made that Alis might be compromised with Belgian interests in Africa.
Alis had previously accused Le Châtelier of seeking personal gain in the Congo.
Colonel Baudot and Commandant de Castelli acted for Chatelier, while Paul Bluysen and André Hallays() of the "Journal des débats" acted for Percher.
The duel proved fatal to Alis.
After the duel Le Chatelier lost influence in colonial policy.
In June 1895 he returned to the French Congo.
His plans were frustrated. 
The Belgian railway was inaugurated in 1896 and the French work was abandoned.
He left the Congo for Paris in March 1896.
Ceramic workshop (1896–1902).
On 5 August 1896 Le Chatelier married Marie Émilie Charlotte Langlois (1858–1930).
His wife seems to have had artistic interests, and let him use part of her personal wealth to open the Atelier de Glatigny in the rural area of Glatigny (Le Chesnay), near Versailles.
The workshop made sandstone ceramics, high-quality porcelain and glassware.
In 1901 the critic Henri Cazalis (alias Jean Lahor), listed the workshop as one of the best producers in France of Art Nouveau ceramics.
Le Chatelier's brother, the chemist Henry Louis Le Chatelier, seems to have encouraged Alfred's workshop, assisted with experiments in the composition of porcelain and the reactions of quartz inclusions, and designed a thermoelectric pyrometer to measure temperature in the kilns.
Le Chatelier remained in contact with politics, and provided detailed instructions to the 1898 trans-Sahara expedition organised by Fernand Foureau and Captain François Amédée Lamy, whom he had known before in the French Congo and the Sahara.
The well-prepared and well-led expedition was the first French expedition to succeed in crossing the Sahara.
In April 1900 Le Chatelier wrote and printed the brochure "Lettre à un Algérien sur la politique saharienne", which he sent to leading politicians.
The brochure showed the risks of rash action on the Moroccan border and called for a cautious but firm policy.
Eugène Étienne and Paul Révoil both supported the brochure, and Le Chatelier was established as a force to be considered in setting North African policy.
Last years (1902–29).
The Atelier de Glatigny closed in 1902 when Alfred Le Chatelier was appointed to the chair of Muslim sociology in the Collège de France.
The concept of the chair originated in an 1888 proposal by Le Chatelier to establish a central office for Islamic studies and research.
This office would act as a clearing house for information on Islam, and would define French policy towards Islamic subjects.
The concept was revived early in 1901, and after some resistance the chair was created for La Chatelier in 1902.
The choice of name implied that Le Chatelier and his colleagues were engaged in the modern discipline of sociology rather than outdated ethnology.
In 1904 Le Chatelier founded the Mission scientifique du Maroc (Scientific Mission of Morocco) at his own expense, and later received a grant from the Ministry of Education.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs supported the mission in part because a single focus for all research seemed administratively tidy, in part to avoid problems with "unauthorized" explorers in Morocco, and in part in reaction to the aggressive local scholars in Algeria, the "École d'Alger", who advocated direct military intervention rather than peaceful penetration.
Le Chatelier played a key part in documenting the ethnic groups of Morocco, and inspired and supervised preparation of the multi-volume "Archives marocaines" and the "Villes et Tribus du Maroc" series.
Le Chatelier engaged in an acrimonious struggle with the École d'Alger for control over Moroccan research.
Le Chatelier proposed France should control Morocco indirectly through the sultanate.
By contrast, Edmond Doutté and the École d'Alger thought France should impose a secular and technocratic state independent of the Islamic leaders.
The French resident general Hubert Lyautey combined the approaches, with indirect rule through a "sharifian" sultanate controlled by the French military technocracy.
In 1906 Le Châtelier launched the "Revue du monde musulman" (Review of the Muslim World).
The journal covered contemporary Islamic societies around the world, a group of vital communities with a shared tradition adapting quickly to the new order.
In this it was utterly different from conventional studies of Islamic society that treated their subjects as static and outdated.
It also differed from other journals in trying to attract Muslim readers, and to this end published translations from Muslim newspapers of Central Asia, India, Persia, the Caucasus, Turkey and the Arab East.
Sixty-four issues were published between 1906 and 1926 giving a sensitive, sympathetic and informed view of the crisis that Islam was going through.
Contributors included the linguist Lucien Bouvat and the Islamologist Louis Massignon.
In its first year the review reached a circulation of 1,200 copies.
Le Chatelier saw two ways in which Muslim societies responded to Western modernization.
The more complex societies such as Egypt, Syria and Turkey gradually replaced Islamic faith by nationalism.
The more "primitive" Muslims in North Africa turned their back on modern ideas and embraced the mysticism of Sufi brotherhoods.
The "Revue du monde musulman" did not oppose colonialism.
Le Chatelier tried to put to rest the fears of colonial officials that some huge pan-Islamic movement would sweep aside their authority, and to assure them that if a realistic, fact-based and sympathetic policy were adopted toward the Muslim subjects of French colonies there need be no unrest.
In 1911 Le Chatelier published "La conquête du monde Musulman", a survey of Protestant missions in Islamic societies, in the "Revue du monde musulman".
The article was quickly translated into Arabic and published in many Egyptian newspapers.
The Egyptian editor wrote that the way to avoid British dominance was not a program of re-Islamization, but for Muslim gentlemen to stand up to Christian gentlemen.
Le Chatelier was professor at the Collège de France until 1925.
He died on 9 August 1929 aged 73.

Operation Long John

Operation Long John was an operation undertaken by the Selous Scouts of the Rhodesian Army on 25 June 1976 against two ZANLA guerrilla bases located in Mozambique near Mapai. Operation Long John was an attack on a guerrilla transit camp at Mapai and staging post identified as Chicualacuala. 
The plan of the operations would involve the first use of a tactic by the Rhodesian Security Forces that would become known as the "Flying-Column Attack". The transit camp was located approximately 60 kilometres inside Mozambique. 
It was necessary to introduce a reconnaissance force into the area in order to determine the exact location and size of the camp. It was confirmed that approximately 90 ZANLA insurgents were staged at Chicualacuala, and a large ZANLA arsenal was located at Mapai. The confirmation of an arsenal" meant that the attacking force would come in contact with FRELIMO soldiers of Mozambique. 
The new government of Mozambique was willing to provide sanctuary for the Patriotic Front insurgents, but they would not allow them to travel throughout the countryside in armed groups. Their weapons were maintained and guarded by FRELIMO soldiers, and issued immediately prior to their infiltration into Rhodesia.
The plan involved a mechanised assault across the border utilising armoured cars, trucks, and several buses. The attack would bypass Chicualacuala, and strike directly at Mapai. The former would be eliminated on the return trip.

Fashion influencer

A fashion influencer is a personality that has a large number of followers on social media, creates mainly fashion content and has the power to influence the opinion and purchase behavior of others with their recommendations. Brands endorse them to attend fashion shows, parties, designer dinners and exclusive trips and to wear their clothes on social media. If a salary has been involved, the influencer has to label such posts as paid or sponsored content. Before social media "they would have been called 'It girls'".
Today in 2020, this profession has become extremely saturated. Instagram is the main app used for fashion influencing.
Business magazine "Forbes" identified fashion influencers as "the new celebrity endorsements". However, influencers seem to have a closer relationship with their audience than traditional celebrities. As marketers Jung von Matt, Brandnew IO and Facelift point out: "Daily interactions across multiple channels, through photos, stories or live sessions, create a form of closeness and trust" that make influencers "often more tangible than traditional celebrities".
In 2017, "Forbes" named Chiara Ferragni, Danielle Bernstein, Julia Engel, Gabi Gregg, Jenn Im, Susanna Lau, Nicolette Mason, Simone Zippi Stardust, Aimee Song and Bryan Yambao, also known as Bryanboy, as the top influencers in the fashion category.
History.
In the beginning of 2000, fashion blogs appeared to be amateurish personal areas. They were created as a hobby by fashion lovers to share their ideas of the latest trends or to get a job in the traditional fashion industry later on. With increasing reach, bloggers learned to monetize their contents. As Pedroni remarks: “fashion blogs evolved from personal diaries kept by fashion lovers, into sophisticated marketing and economic tools”.
Shortly after, new social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube spread. They enabled bloggers to reach a greater audience and have an even closer relationship with their existing readership. In fact, some bloggers closed their blogs as traffic moved to other platforms such as Instagram. According to researcher Emily Hund “Social media’s influencer economy has gained steam quickly in the last few years, particularly on platforms like Instagram and Pinterest, whose image-heavy nature easily lends itself to commerce”. Social media also gave rise to influencers who did not have a blog in the first place. Jenn Im became a fashion influencer due to her successful YouTube channel, German influencer due to her high reach on Instagram.
In 2017, Instagram was the social media platform with the highest reach for fashion influencers. Forbes calculated that the top ten fashion influencers combined generated a reach of 23,3 million on Instagram. At the same time, the fashion industry had the highest share on Instagram influencer marketing in the US. Its share, approximately 61 percent, dominated by far subsequent sectors investing in influencer marketing such as travel (8 percent) and food and drinks (7 percent). The fashion industry spends around €1 billion on sponsored Instagram posts per year.
By 2019, many fashion influencers had "closet accounts" dedicated to them on social media. Often influential in their own right, these accounts search clothing websites to identify the clothes the influencers wear, and post the resulting shopping list. In doing so, they amplify the marketing power of the influencers and help shape business trends.
Business.
Fashion influencers generate income through brand co-operations and affiliate links. Principal sources of income are brand co-operations in terms of product placement. Fashion influencers are paid to pose with specific products on their social media channels and must mark them correspondingly.
The economic value of a fashion influencer is most commonly measured by number of followers. Other key aspects are demographics of their followers, engagement rate and fit between influencer and brand. The latter is the necessary precondition for influencers to work with a brand. As thousands of people follow them for their authentic personality and style, influencers must be able to identify themselves with the brand in order to recommend it convincingly. Many influencers claim to work exclusively with brands they really like and would recommend in private as well. Influencer Camille Charrière reportedly turned down a 5-digit offer of Macy’s, because she could not identify with the clothes: “At the end of the day, I’m selling my taste and my eye – if I do things off-brand I will lose the respect”.
For fashion influencers.
Successful fashion influencers generate an income through their social media activities that enables them to quit their jobs and focus solely on their social media career. German fashion influencer Xenia van der Woodsen (xeniaoverdose) left her full-time job at an investment trust, when she realized that she could earn more money with a single Instagram post than working mana full day in a regular job. Robert and Christina are US-based Instagram fashion influencers and bloggers with over 450K followers on Instagram. They feature content on fashion, decor, travel, and their life together, and have you covered for all kinds of style inspiration – her style, his style, and couple style.
Until fashion influencer Danielle Bernstein spoke out on her mid-six figures income in 2015, financial information about the influencer business were relatively rare and inconsistent. In 2017, a study of Jung von Matt, Brandnew IO and Facelift revealed that such a high income is relatively rare among influencers. Only eight out of the 1,200 interviewed influencers earn in average between $10,000 – 25,000 per campaign and only three of them more than $25,000. Albeit the “leading fashion influencers in Germany make over one million in revenue each year”, the majority makes less than $1,000 per campaign.
A majority of influencers receive a salary. Solely a minority of 20 percent makes brand co-operations in exchange for giveaways. The salary primarily depends on the number of followers. The higher the follower number, the higher the salary range. The price for a cooperation depends also on the contract terms, for example if it concerns a one-time Instagram post or a long-term partnership including several posts. Xenia van der Woodsen, one of Germany’s top three fashion influencers in 2017, accepts only long-term brand co-operations in the majority of cases. In her experience, posts of long-term campaigns appear more authentic and credible, whereas single paid content pieces stand out as advertisement.
Affiliate links.
Affiliate links enable fashion influencers to earn money on commission. The procedure was introduced by Amber Venz Box in 2011 and then updated in 2014.
For fashion brands.
Fashion brands use the reach and positive reputation of influencers by implementing influencer marketing. Influencers spread brand messages, increase brand awareness, contribute to a positive brand image and increase sales by tagging fashion brands in their posts.
Although data that shows the direct correlation between influencer campaigns and sales are rare, the success of affiliate platforms as rewardStyle and successful examples such as the #mangogirls campaign, indicate that influencer engagement affects sales. In the #mangogirls campaign several influencers had independently chosen the same coat as their favorite piece of the Mango collection and showcased it on Instagram. The coat went viral and sold-out. In fact, first studies show that every third consumer has already bought a product following the recommendation of an influencer.
Criticism.
Fashion influencers have been criticized by journalists for their lack of transparency on sponsored posts. The lines between posts in which influencers share product recommendations for free or because they are paid for it are often blurred. Influencers are supposed to mark a sponsored post with hashtags such as #ad or #sponsored, but often use less-obvious hashtags like #sp or none at all.
Due to this lack of transparency, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sent out dozens of warning letters to Instagram influencers in the beginning of 2017, giving further indications to influencers and marketers on how to disclose advertising and sponsored posts. Following the rules of the FTC, hashtags like #ad have to appear before the "more" button and are not allowed to be buried in a flood of other hashtags. Thus, "anyone endorsing a brand must "clearly and conspicuously" declare connections to it, for example, if products have been given free, if a payment has been made for the endorsement or if there is a business or family relationship".
in June 2017, Instagram launched a new disclosure system with which users can tag sponsors in a post. If the brand confirms the commercial relation, the post is marked with a "paid partnership" tag at the top.

She was the daughter of the Jewish banker Ammar of Alexandria, married Arye ben Yehudah and moved to Cairo, but divorced early, and made a business career of her own. She is known for her successful business career as well as her love life, both of which made her a remarkable exception from the otherwise secluded women in Egypt regardless of religion. She was a leading member of the Cairo business world, often appearing in court for her business tasks, in contrast to the otherwise secluded life of women in then Cairo. She also made a scandal by challenging social and sexual conventions, living with a lover and having a child with him out of wedlock, which had her banned from the synagogue in 1095. She is also known for her will from 1104, in which she donated her vast fortune to various institutions and charitable subjects within the Jewish community of Cairo.

Licoricia of Winchester

Licoricia of Winchester (born early 13th century- died 1277) was a Jewish-English moneylender. She has been described by historian Robert Stacey as 'the most important Jewish woman in medieval England'.
She was an English moneylender, wife and mother, who despite the increasingly difficult circumstances of the Jews in thirteenth century England, which involved regular, punitive taxation, arbitrary imprisonments, and increasing religious intolerance (Fourth Council of the Lateran, Blood Libel) advanced through advantageous marriages and business acumen. She appears to have had a close relationship with King Henry III. 
Life.
Licoricia's own name is an odd one, and it reflects a fashion in early thirteenth century England, among Christian and Jewish women, for exotic names such as Floria, Saffronia, Almonda, Preciosa, Bellassez and Comtissa, and while these names were sometimes replicated in different families, Licoricia appears not to have been such a popular choice. This partly explains why her life and career show up more clearly in the record.
Licoricia first appears in records in 1234, as a young widow with three sons. Her financing activities are documented from the early 1230s, when she lent money in association with other Jews, as well as by herself with an attorney. 
In 1242, she married her second husband David of Oxford (d. 1244), who was known as the richest Jew in England. He wanted to marry her so much that he divorced his wife Muriel and Henry III prevented the English Beth Din putting obstacles before his remarriage. However, Licoricia was detained by the King at the Tower of London for surety for the King's portion of David's estate upon her husband's death in 1244. This portion totalled 5,000 marks. From this, 4,000 marks were used to fund the rebuilding of Westminster Abbey and the shrine to Edward the Confessor. Upon her release, in September 1244, Licoricia returned to live with her family in Winchester, where she continued David's business and began further enterprises of her own.
Over the next 30 years, Licoricia became a highly influential business woman, financing people across Southern England. At the time there were several important female Jews in the field, including Chera and Belia. Her clients included King Henry III of England and Queen Eleanor of Provence amongst other notable nobles, including Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester prior to his rebellion in the Second Barons' War (1264–67).
Her son Benedict became the only Jewish Guildsman in medieval England and probably anywhere else in Western Europe. This enabled him to own tenements and houses, and be a citizen, both of which were impossible for the rest of the Jewish community. Her son by David of Oxford, Asher, was imprisoned in Winchester Castle in 1287, whilst the King was attempting to impose a large taxation on the Jews (the thirteenth century witnessed immense taxation on the Jews under John and under Henry III from the 1240s), and left graffiti there, which stated in Hebrew, 'On Friday, eve of the Sabbath in which the portion Emor is read, all the Jews of the land of the isle were imprisoned. I, Asher, inscribed this'. Little evidence exists of what her other children did, but it is possible they were involved in the activities of most of the Jewish Community, such as trading, jewelry, metalwork, medicine, clerks, or scribes (the vast majority of the community was not involved in significant moneylending). It is unlikely that they were pedlars, like many of the poorest of the community.
The upper limit that the Jews could charge varied between two or three pence per pound per week. The Cahorsins (a term to denote French) and Lombards could charge as much as 50 per cent ; the Jews did not have a monopoly on lending.
In early 1277, Licoricia was found murdered inside her house on Jewry Street with her Christian servant, Alice of Bickton. Three men were indicted for the murders, but none were convicted, and the murder was never solved.
Legacy.
Planning permission for a statue commemorating Licoricia of Winchester and her son Asher, by the sculptor Ian Rank-Broadley to be sited on Jewry Street in Winchester was granted in August 2018, and funds are now being raised for this project, to lead people to the history of the medieval Jewish community, and their royal connections, as well as promote tolerance and diversity today, inspire women and young people, and beautify Winchester.

2018–19 NCAA football bowl games

The 2018–19 NCAA football bowl games were a series of college football bowl games completing the 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The games began on December 15, 2018, and, aside from the all-star games that follow, ended with the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship, which was played on January 7, 2019.
The total of 40 team-competitive bowls in FBS, including the national championship game, was unchanged from the previous year. To fill the 78 available bowl slots, a total of 10 teams (13% of all participants) with non-winning records (6–6) were invited to bowl games. This was the second consecutive year, and only the third time in eight years, that no teams with losing seasons (6–7 or 5–7) were invited to fill available bowl berths.
Only 39 of the 40 bowls were played, with the First Responder Bowl becoming the first ever postseason game at the FBS-level (or its predecessors) to be cancelled, as a severe lightning storm lingered for over two hours near the Cotton Bowl Stadium. The game was scored as a no-contest for the teams involved.
The three all-star games were the East–West Shrine Game and NFLPA Collegiate Bowl, played on January 19, and the Senior Bowl, played on January 26.
Schedule.
The schedule for the 2018–19 bowl games is below. All times are EST (UTC−5).
College Football Playoff and Championship Game.
The College Football Playoff system is used to determine a national championship of Division I FBS college football. A 13-member committee of experts ranked the top 25 teams in the nation after each of the last seven weeks. The top four teams in the final ranking play in a single-elimination semifinal round, with the winners advancing to the National Championship game.
The semifinal games for the 2018–19 season were the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl. Both were played on December 29 as part of a yearly rotation of three pairs of six bowls, commonly referred to as the New Year's Six bowl games. The winners advanced to the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, on January 7.
All games in this table were televised on ESPN.
Non-CFP bowl games.
For the 2018–19 bowl season, the Gasparilla Bowl was re-located from Tropicana Field to Raymond James Stadium (which already hosts the Outback Bowl). Under new sponsorship deals in comparison to the prior season's bowl games, the Cactus Bowl was renamed the Cheez-It Bowl, the Heart of Dallas Bowl was renamed the First Responder Bowl, and the Foster Farms Bowl was renamed the Redbox Bowl. The Gator Bowl name was reinstated for the first time since the 2013 season, as it had been known as the TaxSlayer Bowl for the four prior editions.
FCS bowl game.
The FCS has one bowl game; they also have a championship bracket that began on November 24 and ended on January 5.
Team selections.
Generally, a team must have at least six wins to be considered bowl eligible. The College Football Playoff semi-final games are determined based on the top four seeds in the playoff committee's final rankings. The remainder of the bowl eligible teams are selected by each respective bowl based on conference tie-ins, order of selection, match-up considerations, and other factors.
CFP top 25 standings and bowl games.
On December 2, 2018, the College Football Playoff selection committee announced their final team rankings for the season.
Three of the four semifinalists – Alabama, Clemson, and Oklahoma – had also been semifinalists the previous season.
Conference champions' bowl games.
Three bowls will feature two conference champions playing against each other—the Boca Raton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Rose Bowl. Rankings are per the above CFP standings.
Bowl–eligible teams.
Number of bowl berths available and assigned: 78&lt;br&gt;
Number of bowl-eligible teams: 82
Bowl-eligible teams that did not receive a berth.
As there were more bowl-eligible teams than berths available, four teams that were bowl-eligible did not receive an invitation.
Bowl–ineligible teams.
Number of bowl-ineligible teams: 48

Pulcelina of Blois

Pulcelina of Blois (died 1171) was a Jewish woman, mistress and/or moneylender to the count Theobald V of Blois. 
According to the chronicle, Pulcelina was a Jewish woman with great influence over Theobald V, which created envy among the local elite as well as the countess, Alix of France. The chronicle claims that she was the mistress of Theobald V, but she may have been only his moneylender, having had influence over him on that account, rather than as his lover. 
In 1171, a Jew of the local Blois community was accused of blood libel by the servant of a local nobleman, who used the accusation to go against Pulcelina. Theobald V had the Blois Jews imprisoned, and when Pulcelina attempted to use her influence to free them, she and her two daughters, as well as 31 other Jews of Blois, were burned alive.

Patron saints of the Hen Ogledd

This is a list of saints associated with Cumbria, Lancashire, Yorkshire and the wider Hen Ogledd: many of them have links to regions with significant ancient British history, such as Wales, Cornwall, Brittany or Devon.
Saint Kentigern.
Saint Kentigern, also known as Saint Mungo is said to have been the son of Taneu, a princess of Gododdin, in the Hen Ogledd. He is believed to have died around 612 AD. Taneu became pregnant after her rape by the leader of the Kingdom of Rheged, Owain mab Urien. Later in his life, after expulsion from Pictland, the region of the Picts, he was invited to live in another Hen Ogledd kingdom called Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde). From there it is believed he was one of the first saints to introduce Christianity to Scotland.
Saint Patrick.
Saint Patrick lived in Britain in the 5th century. At the age of 16 he was kidnapped by Irish pirate and spent nearly 6 years in Ireland until he escaped and returned to Britain. Later, he became ordained and returned to Ireland, where it is believed that he performed numerous miracles, such as ridding the snakes from Ireland - though this is thought to be an allegory for the subduing of paganism on the island. In some traditions he was born in Glannoventa, modern day Ravenglass in Cumbria, which was then part of the kingdom of Rheged. 
Saint Oswald and Saint Cuthbert.
Saint Oswald (c. 604 - 642) and Saint Cuthbert (634/635 - 687) are recorded in many texts originating in the Hen Ogledd as being part of personal names with the element '"gos"', meaning 'servant of'. For example, in Jocelin's lives of the Saints- "Gospatrick", "Gosmungo" (an alias, Mungo's original name was Kentigern), "Gososwald" and "Goscuthbert" all appear as people's personal names. The form of gos is unique in Cumbric. As well as this, the fact that many people in the Hen Ogledd chose to use these saints in their names is evidence for a following of these saints in the region.
In the White Book of Rhydderch there is a mention of "Gospatrick", in the Black Book of Carmarthen there is an alternate spelling as "Gosparth."

Evidence of Dei Mansi’s skill extends beyond that of scribe to that of a Torah scholar. Dei Mansi contributed to her father's biblical commentary, adding her own explanations in the commentary, in addition to translating the work from Hebrew into Italian. Dei Mansi also transcribed a Hebrew prayer book and added her own explanations as commentary to the prayers. A third work, a collection of laws, is known to have been transcribed by Dei Mansi who wrote the work at the request of a relative.

Atlantic County Executive

The County Executive of Atlantic County, New Jersey, United States is the chief officer of the county's executive branch and manages the county business, including implementing policy, administering county services, and directing the executive staff. Executives have overseen the administration of county government since the county adopted the form in 1974. The executive offices are located in Atlantic City.
The executive is elected to a four-year term. there were 180,123 registered voters in the county. Since its first county executive took office in 1975, three individuals have served as the county executive, two of whom have been elected to five consecutive terms of office.
, Atlantic County's executive is Republican Dennis Levinson.
History.
Starting in 1967, the county had been governed by a seven-member Board of Chosen Freeholders, all elected at large, having been reduced from a maximum of 35 members that had been reached in 1966, under a form in which each municipality in the county was represented by a freeholder. Under the pre-1967 system, each municipality had freeholders, but in a manner that gave disproportionate representation to smaller municipalities. Corbin City's 238 residents had two representatives, while Atlantic City, with more than 60,000 residents, had four freeholders.
In 1972, the state passed the Optional County Charter Law, which provided for four different manners in which a county could be governed, including by an executive, and administrator, a board president or a county supervisor.
The county established a Charter Study Commission in 1973, which recommended the changes that were ultimately accepted. In November 1974, Atlantic County voters changed the county governmental form under the Optional County Charter Law to the county executive form. The charter provided for an executive directly by the voters and a nine-member Board of Chosen Freeholders, responsible for legislation. The executive is elected to a four-year term and the freeholders are elected to staggered three-year terms, of which four are elected from the county on an at-large basis and five of the freeholders represent equally populated districts.
Atlantic County joins Bergen, Essex, Hudson and Mercer counties as one of the five of 21 New Jersey counties with an elected executive.
County executives.
1975–1979.
Democrat Charles D. Worthington, the first county executive, took office in 1975 while serving his only term in the New Jersey General Assembly. The incoming freeholder board was dominated by Republicans, who held a 7-2 majority, flipping the 5-2 majority that Democrats had held on the freeholder board in place under the previous form of government.
1980–1999.
Richard "Dick" Squires was born in 1932 in Atlantic City and was raised Egg Harbor Township.
A former Freeholder, Republican Squires defeated Worthington in the 1979 general election. Squires served in office as county executive for 20 years, until deciding in 1999 that he would not run for re-election. Squires won re-election in 1987, defeating Democrat Mary Haynie in an election that had focused on plans for the expansion of Atlantic City International Airport.
2000–present.
Republican Dennis Levinson was raised in Ventnor City and graduated from Atlantic City High School, before earning a bachelor's degree at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University). He taught history for three decades at the Northfield Community Schools.
Prior to his election to the Board of Freeholders he served as a Councilmember in the city of Northfield from 1982 to 1986. First elected as a freeholder in an upset over Joe Messick, Levinson was chosen by his peers as Freeholder Chairman six times.
Levinson was first elected Atlantic County Executive in 1999, winning 53% of the vote and spending $111,000 to defeat Democrat Tom Foley. He was re-elected in 2003 with 83% of the vote and no Republican opposition. In 2007, Levinson won with 65% of the vote, defeating Sheriff Jim McGeittigan, a Republican who changed parties to run for election. In 2011, Levinson again won reelection with two-thirds of the vote, defeating Democrat Clifton Sudler, who had never previously run for elective office. In 2015, Democratic challenger Jim Schroeder dropped out of the race in September, weeks before the election, citing health concerns. Schroeder's name stayed on the ballot and Levinson won with 63% of the vote, by a margin of 28,431 to 16,542.

Hong Kong Watch

Hong Kong Watch is a non-governmental organisation (NGO) based in the United Kingdom that was established to monitor the conditions of human rights, freedoms and rule of law in Hong Kong. It was founded by British human rights activist Benedict Rogers on 11 December 2017, two months after he was barred from entering Hong Kong.
History.
In Hong Kong, the aftermath of the 2014 Hong Kong protests and Legislative Council oath-taking controversy saw the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists and Benedict Rogers, a British human rights activist, intended to visit them privately. On 11 October 2017, Rogers was barred entry to Hong Kong. He arrived at Hong Kong International Airport on a flight from Bangkok but was escorted away by immigration officials and placed on a flight back to Thailand. He had previously been warned by a contact in the Chinese embassy in London that he might be refused entry to Hong Kong. Rogers, who lived in Hong Kong between 1997 and 2002, has criticised what Rogers says is Mainland China's increasing threat to democracy in Hong Kong and has campaigned against the imprisonment of pro-democracy activists Joshua Wong, Nathan Law and Alex Chow. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded an explanation from the Hong Kong authorities and the Central Chinese government. Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, later responded that the move was within China's sovereignty and said: "Whether this person's trip to Hong Kong involved an intention to intervene in Hong Kong's internal affairs and judicial independence – he knows very well himself."
The following day, Rogers announced he would form a non-governmental organisation (NGO) to monitor the rule of law and human rights in Hong Kong. Hong Kong Watch was launched at a reception hosted in Speaker's House, House of Commons in the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 11 December 2017. The organisation appointed Johnny Patterson as its founding Director, with Rogers acting as Chair of Trustees It was established on grounds of the belief of the fact that under the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the United Kingdom has a moral and legal obligation to speak out. 
IPAC
In the summer of 2020, the leadership of Hong Kong Watch worked with human rights leaders such as Luke de Pulford to create the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, a global pressure group, advocating for human rights in China, particularly with regards the Uyghur genocide and Democracy in Hong Kong. 
New appointments in 2020
Benedict Rogers joined the staff team of the organisation in September 2020 as Chief Executive Officer, with Patterson moving to Policy Director. The organisation also brought in veteran Labour party staffer Sam Goodman as senior policy advisor and Hong Kong activist in exile, Joey Siu, as an Associate based in Washington DC.
Mission.
Hong Kong Watch was set up to provide independent, comprehensive analysis and thought leadership on freedom and human rights in Hong Kong.

Margriet Prajoux-Bouma

Margriet "Grietje" Prajoux-Bouma (also Marguerite; born 19 June 1912) was a Dutch alpine skier living in France. She competed for the Netherlands in the women's giant slalom at the 1952 Winter Olympics.
Allegedly hailing from Franeker, she moved to France, where between 1936 (in Megève) and 1951 she participated in French skiing competitions. In May 1938, as a Dutch citizen and aged 25, she took a trip to the United States, accompanied by the 51-year-old hotel manager (Eugène Vincent) Emile Prajoux. The couple married 12 April 1940 in Paris. Emile Prajoux died before 1951 and Bouma became a Dutch citizenship again, though she remained in Paris. She won the 1951 and 1952 Dutch combined skiing competition, the latter apparently as sole competitor, and was selected as the female Dutch skiing participant in the 1952 Winter Olympics. At nearly 40 years old she has been the oldest Dutch Winter Olympics competitor.
On February 14, 1952, she competed in the women's giant slalom. She finished 40th and last in 3:31 minutes, 33 seconds behind the next competitor and 84 seconds behind the winner. She then withdrew from participation in the slalom and downhill races. Partially because of her poor results, the Dutch Olympic committee decided to tighten selection criteria for participation.

Katharina Mangold-Wirz

Katharina Maria Mangold-Wirz, née Wirz, (born Basel 23 May 1922 - died 2003) was a Swiss marine biologist and malacologist, who worked at Université Pierre et Marie Curie's Laboratoire Arago in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France.
Mangold-Wirz was born in Basel on 23 May 1922 to Eduard Wirz (1891–1970), a teacher, historian and writer, and Clara Wirz-Burgin. She graduated from high school in Basel in 1940 and went to Basel University to study medicine with the ambition of being a brain surgeon. However, she was discouraged from pursuing this ambition by specialists in Switzerland as she was "too short, female and appeared frail!" She switched to studying zoology from 1943 to 1948, achieving a D.Phil. with her thesis on non-human brains, with Adolf Portmann, as her supervisor being published in 1950 in "Acta Anatomica". She was awarded a 3-year scholarship at the Janggen-Pöhn Foundation of St Gallen to carry out research on Opisthobranchs from 1950 in Villefranche-sur-Mer and Banyuls-sur-Mer. In 1951 she was appointed as a researcher at the Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique and her focus from then was on the biology of cephalopods. Portmann acted as her mentor until he died in 1982.
In 1958 she married Walter Mangold and in 1961 she was awarded the "Doctorat ès Sciences" ("Doctorat d'état") from the University of Paris with her thesis being published in "Vie et Meileu". In that year she was also promoted to Research Fellow at the Centre National de la Recherché Scientifique and in 1966 she was appointed as a Senior Researcher. In 1969 overseas recognition came with her appointment as a visiting Research Professor at the Memorial University of Newfoundland. Further recognition came in 1983 when she was elected as the first president of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council at their meeting in Banyuls-sur-Mer. She retired from academia in 1987 but she continued as an active scientist. In 1989 she was the co-author of the cephalopod volume of the textbook with Grassé, "Traité du Zoologie" and in 1993 she was appointed an honorary life member of the Cephalopod International Advisory Council. She died in Basel on 22 November 2003.
The octopus "Microeledone mangoldi" and the squid "Asperoteuthis mangoldae" are named in her honour.

Hyporhamphus unifasciatus

Hyporhamphus unifasciatus, the common halfbeak or the Atlantic silverstripe halfbeak, is a bony fish in the family Hemiramphidae. It is found in the subtropical western Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. It is a common fish and not used for food to any great extent, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed its conservation status as being of "least concern".
Description.
The common halfbeak grows to a length of about . It is an elongated cylindrical fish, tapering slightly at both ends; the length is typically six to ten times the depth. As is typical of halfbeaks, the lower jaw is elongated (less so in young fish) while the upper jaw is short. There are many sharp teeth, and the dorsal surface of the head has a patch of enlarged scales. The dorsal fin has 14 to 16 soft rays and the anal fin has 15 to 17 soft rays, these two fins being of equivalent size and both being set far back near the caudal peduncle. There are no extra little finlets between them and the tailfin. The general colour of this fish is dark green with a silvery sheen. There are three dark longitudinal lines on the top of the back and the fins have dusky edges. A silvery line runs from the eye to the caudal peduncle, and the flanks below this are paler. In the living fish, the tip of the lower jaw is red. The lining of the abdominal cavity is black.
Distribution and habitat.
The common halfbeak is native to the sub-tropical western Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes both the Atlantic coasts of America, the Caribbean coast and the Gulf of Mexico, and its range extends as far north as the Gulf of Maine. It occurs in the shallow sublittoral zone down to depths of about in coastal areas, bays and estuaries.
Ecology.
This is a schooling fish living in surface waters. It is an omnivore, feeding on algae, pieces of seagrass, small invertebrates and fish. It is oviparous.
Status.
The common halfbeak is a common fish in most of its range and is especially abundant in the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is sometimes caught as bycatch when fishing for other species but, although it is edible, it is not much esteemed. No specific threats to this species have been identified and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed it as being of "least concern".

The Chigoubiche Lake is the main freshwater body at the head of the Chigoubiche River (slope of the Ashuapmushuan River), flowing into the unorganized territory of Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec, in the Regional County Municipality (MRC) Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
Located halfway between Saint-Félicien, Quebec and Chibougamau, Lake Chigoubiche is the largest body of water in the Ashuapmushuan Wildlife Reserve. This lake straddles the townships of Lorne, Bochart, Avaugour and Argenson.
The Canadian National Railway runs along the northeast shore of the lake. The route 167 linking Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec passes on the northeast shore of the lake. A forest road bypasses the lake.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.
The surface of Lake Chigoubiche is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
During his 1732 expedition, surveyor Joseph-Laurent Normandin noted this toponym which derives from the Innu term "ushukupish", meaning "the place where les Betsis (Saw-Bees) brood". This toponym knows several graphic variants such as "Lake Chigobiche", "Lake Shecoubish" and "Ushukupis Shakahikan"; the latter form being the one used today by the Innus of Mashteuiatsh. From about 1950 to 1964, this body of water will be designated "Argenson Lake", after the name of the township where it is located.
At the time of Normandin, the region's Native people considered the river course and Chigoubiche Lake as the shortest way to reach the Ashuapmushuan Lake which is located a few kilometers farther west. According to his exploration notes, Normandin notes the abundance of furbearing animals in this area, including beavers, caribou, foxes and martens; hunters and traders frequenting this game region.
Today, in addition to still hunting in this territory, nature lovers also practice sport fishing, including pike and walleye.
The toponym "lac Chigoubiche" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

A.M. Hirschsprung &amp; Sønner

A.M. Hirschsprung &amp; Sønner was a Danish tobacco company based in Copenhagen, Denmark.
History.
The company was founded in 1826 when Abraham Marcus Hirschsprung (1793 - 1871), who had come to Denmark from Hamburg, established a tobacco store in the basement of Hotel d'Angleterre. The hotel was then located at the corner of Østergade (No.2) and Kongens Nytorv.
A.M. Hirschsprung was still just s small company when it was taken over by two of Hirschsprung's sons Bernhard Hirschsprung (1834 - 1909) and Heinrich Hirschsprung (1836-1908). Heinrich Hirschsprung was put in charge of the commercial activities while Bernhard Hirschsprung was responsible for the production. Heinrich Hirschsprung , a passionate art collector, founded the Hirschsprung Collection in Copenhagen. 
Under Heinrich and Barnhard Hirschsprung's leadership, A. M. Hirschsprung &amp; Sønner grew to become one of the leading tobacco companies in the country. They purchased a property at Østergade 6 in 1864 and replaced it with a new building in 1870. They also constructed a new tobacco factory at Tordenskjoldsgade 7-9 in the new Gammelholm neighbourhood. The factory was completed in 1866 to design by Ove Pedersen (1830-1892) and later altered by Axel Maar (1888-1978). 
The company was converted into a limited company ("aktieselskab") in 1899. Holger Hirschsprung was appointed as CEO and the board members were H. N. Andersen, Is. Glückstadt, Bernhard og Heinrich Hirschsprung and A. B. Munter.
In 1855, A.M. Hirschsprung &amp; Sønner moved to a new headquarters in Virum. The company was taken over by Scandinavian Tobacco Group in 1972.
Legacy.
A.M. Hirschsprung &amp; Sønner's former properties on Østergade, Tordenskjoldsgade and Virum have survived. The door of the building at Østergade 6 features rough iron decorations with smoking angels.
The building in Virum, now known as Hirschsprung House ("Hirschsprungs Hus"), was sold by Scandinavian Tobacco Group in 1985 and has served as headquarters for Rambøll. The building is now owned by the pension fund PKA. It was refurbished in 2017 and NNE, a Novo Nordisk subsidiary, is now based in the building.

The institute has a high level of technological-sports research and thanks to this it can carry out sophisticated studies that support the sports careers of all its students. Home to Los Halcones Dorados, the best student soccer team, the IAD has suffered an unexpected setback: most of the team members have left the institution to attend other schools or join the lower divisions of professional teams. Gabo is the key to rebuilding the team but that does not fall in favor of Lorenzo Guevara (Sebastián Athie) (Player number 9) who is the star striker and the only one of the original players who remains at the Institute. Although Gabo will have to face numerous challenges at the IAD, he will not do it alone, since he has the support of his friends Ricardo "Ricky" Flores (Juan David Penagos) (Player number 7) and Andrés "Dedé" Duarte (Luan Brum) ( Player number 6), Zoe Velázquez (Paulina Vetrano) is Francisco's daughter and is Gabo's friend, Joaquín Costa (Javier Eloy Bonnano) is not a player but is a sports reporter or journalist.

If until now you have had to adapt to a new world, you will have to test the values, convictions and beliefs with which you were formed. At the same time, a Colombian student, Martín (Playdo number 19), arrives on an exchange to join the Falcons as reinforcement. He is a skilled number 8 that not only has a very particular personality marked by a certain tendency to obsession enhanced by an intelligence that far exceeds the average, but also hides a very dark side.

Each episode a winner is chosen, and the contestants who end up on the bottom must face extreme "extermination challenges" which test them physically and psychologically to prove they have the punk spirit required by the judges to remain in the competition.
History.
"The Boulet Brothers Dragula" is created and produced by the Boulet Brothers, and their production company Boulet Brothers Productions. The reality show is loosely based on their club event and nightlife pageant of the same name. The first season of "The Boulet Brothers Dragula" premiered on October 31, 2016 and aired as a six episode pilot series on the YouTube channel Hey Qween!.
Later that year, the show was picked up by Canadian network OutTV who ordered a full remastered and expanded version of Season 1, as well as a full second season of the show.
Season 2 premiered on October 31, 2017 and aired on Amazon Prime and WOW Presents in the United States. The season aired on Amazon Prime in the United Kingdom, OUTtv in Canada and SBS Viceland in Australia. 
The series' third season premiered on Amazon Prime on August 27, 2019. "Dragula" became the first American reality television competition to feature a drag king after Landon Cider appeared as a contestant in Season 3. Beginning October 31, 2019, seasons 2 and 3 of the series moved to the American streaming service Netflix.
On October 20, Dragula had a special episode called "Dragula: Resurrection", where the Boulet Brother's brought back seven past contestants to compete for a spot on season 4. This season had streamed on Shudder, and the winner was Saint from the third season of Dragula.
Format.
Each episode opens with a scripted scene starring the Boulet Brothers that introduces the episode’s theme and challenge. The rest of the episode is filmed in a reality TV documentary format. The competitors are issued that week’s challenge, and must work among each other, work out their interpersonal issues and create their looks and performances for that week.
Floor show.
Each episode features a main “Floor Show” where each of the competitors display their looks and performance on the main stage. The performances and looks are judged, and one competitor is chosen the winner while the two or more lowest scoring competitors are put up for “extermination”.
Extermination challenges.
The show features "Extermination Challenges", fear-based physical and psychological tests created to push the competitors to “face their fears” in order to remain on the show. Past extermination challenges have included being buried alive in a coffin, being pierced with gauged needles, skydiving, eating cow intestines, and surviving an evening in an extreme haunted house. The competitor who fails the extermination challenge is "killed off" by the Boulet Brother's in a scripted scene at the end of each episode.
Judges.
The Boulet Brothers serve as the primary judges on the show, and are the only regular judges on the panel. Each episode they are joined by a rotating cast of celebrity musicians, directors, writers and horror alumni including Henry Rollins, Milly Shapiro, Amanda Lepore, Bonnie Aarons, Felissa Rose, Danielle Harris, Rachel True, and Cig Nuetron. American horror film director Darren Stein and drag legend Peaches Christ are the only judges to have appeared in all three seasons of the show.  
"The Boulet Brothers' Dragula: Resurrection".
A spin-off film titled "The Boulet Brothers' Dragula: Resurrection" was released on AMC Networks' Shudder on October 20, 2020. The film was written, co-directed, and produced by the Boulet Brothers. Digital Spy described it as "part-horror movie, part-documentary and part-reality competition". The film featured a competition between contestants from previous seasons of "Dragula", with the winner returning for the fourth season of "Dragula". The film's soundtrack includes music from Orville Peck and Kim Petras.
Reception.
Since its original online airing, "Dragula" has received positive reviews, and was dubbed “Required Horror Viewing” by "Fangoria". "Vice" writer Jeff Leavell reviewed the series as being "loud, weird" and that it "pisses on heteronormativity". He also said that "Dragula" should not be thought of as "just a show about drag queens who love grotesque, hardcore queer performance art", and that "in its own way, it's encouraging us to stand united, whether you're a supermonster or not".
Adam Zee of Wussy Magazine praised the series for its philosophy towards drag, exemplified by the Boulet Brothers' statement that "We are not here to judge your drag. Drag is art and art is subjective." Zee commented that:"While it seems simple, this simple idea is what truly distinguishes "The Boulet Brother's’ Dragula" from "RuPaul’s Drag Race" and most other reality competitions. The Boulets place significant value in the artistic merit and anti-establishment traditions of drag. They have directed their focus on drag artistry that is unpredictable, outlandish and disturbing rather than getting queens to conform to show business standards. The only molds contestants must fit into are challenge-based or the loose overarching tenets of Filth, Glamour and Horror. Even then, 2 out of 3 is usually good enough to get by."The show has also received favorable coverage for its inclusion of all genders and types of drag performers in the competition, and the series was the first televised U.S. show to feature a drag king and an AFAB drag artist.

2018 Papua New Guinea earthquake

The Papua New Guinea earthquake was a magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred in the Hela Province of Papua New Guinea on 26 February 2018 (25 February UTC), at 3:44 a.m. (25 February, 17:44 UTC). The earthquake's epicenter was west of the town of Komo. The maximum felt intensity was IX ("Violent") on the Mercalli intensity scale. A total of 160 people were killed and many others were injured. An aftershock of M6.0 killed 11 people on 4 March, while another aftershock of M6.7 occurred at 00:13 local time on 7 March, killing at least 25 more. A 6.3 aftershock killed another 4 people on 7 April, more than a month after the first tremors hit the area.
Tectonic setting.
Papua New Guinea lies within the complex zone of collision between the Australian Plate and the Pacific Plate, which converge at a rate of 107 mm per year at the earthquake's location. The Papuan fold and thrust belt, which is responsible for the mountainous New Guinea Highlands, forms the boundary between the Stable Platform area to the south and the Mobile Belt to the north. The Stable Platform consists of little deformed continental crust of the Australian Plate. The Mobile Belt consists of a series of arc terranes and continental fragments previously accreted to the Australian Plate. Current convergence across the fold and thrust belt are estimated at up to 15 mm per year. The thrusting is thick-skinned in type, involving reverse reactivation of much older extensional faults.
Earthquake.
The main shock struck at a depth of 23.4 km below the northern slopes of Mt. Sisa, and was followed by a 5.5 Mb aftershock less than 30 minutes later. The Geohazards Management Division in Port Moresby characterized it as "typical for the Papuan fold and thrust belt".
Aftershocks.
There have been more than 270 aftershocks reported by USGS in total, 68 of which were above magnitude 5, and 6 of which were above magnitude 6.
Aftermath.
Damage.
On the morning of 26 February, ExxonMobil announced that they would temporarily shut down the Hides gas field conditioning plant, situated about from the epicenter, in order to assess damage. Officials later confirmed that all of the staff were "safe and accounted for", while the administration buildings, living quarters, and mess hall had all sustained damage. The company was planning on evacuating all non-essential personnel. Flights into the Komo airfield were temporarily suspended until the runway could be surveyed. Sinkholes and landslides were reported across the affected areas, with electricity supplies also being disrupted. On 10 March, ExxonMobil officials announced that the Hides facility will not be operational for at least 8 weeks, a significant economic loss for the country.
Papua New Guinea's largest oil and gas exploration and development company Oil Search also announced it would shut down production in the Southern Highlands until it could ensure the safety of its employees. The Porgera Gold Mine suffered damage to its gas and electricity infrastructure, while landslips blocked the access road to the Ok Tedi Mine and damaged parts of the highway between Tabubil and Kiunga in the Western Province.
A week after the quake, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement officials estimated that at least 7,000 people had their homes destroyed or damaged, and 150,000 people were in urgent need of emergency supplies, with food and clean water among the biggest concerns. Lack of road access and landslides were hampering deliveries in the area. By 7 March the number of displaced people had risen to 17,000, with continuing problems due to damaged roads and communication difficulties.
The first UNDAC situational overview was released on 10 March, prepared in collaboration with local and international agencies. Over 544,000 people were reported to be affected by the quake, with half of them being targeted for assistance, and more than 26,000 displaced across the western parts of the country.
On 15 March, nearly three weeks after the earthquake, UNICEF estimated that 275,000 people were in need of urgent humanitarian assistance, including 125,000 children.
Indonesia.
The quake and its aftershocks caused panic in Jayapura, the capital of Indonesia's Papua province. The country's National Board for Disaster Management later confirmed that several buildings were damaged in the Boven Digoel Regency, including a mosque, a military post, and a district office.
Casualties.
A total of 160 people were reported to have been killed, while many others were badly injured. Hela Province had at least 80 confirmed deaths, while 45 casualties were reported from the Southern Highlands Province.
On 4 March, a M6.0 aftershock killed 11 people after a landslide buried the small village of Huya. A further 25 people were reported killed by a M6.7 aftershock on 7 March. A M6.3 aftershock on 7 April caused more damage, and four people were killed when houses collapsed in Tari.
Response.
The government of Papua New Guinea dispatched disaster assessment teams to parts of the Southern Highlands and Hela provinces following the earthquake. Members of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force were also mobilised to assist with the delivery of supplies to affected people, as well as the restoration of services and infrastructure. A state of emergency was declared on 1 March for the provinces of Hela, Southern Highlands, Enga and Western, together with a promise of 450 million kina (about 138 million US$) to help deal with the aftermath of the quake. On 8 March, the country's Commerce and Industry Minister Wera Mori estimated that reconstruction will cost at least 600 million kina (about 185 million US$). In addition to the four provinces under a state of emergency, Gulf Province was also discovered to be seriously affected in the quake's aftermath.
The Australian government promised $AU 200,000 in aid and sent a C-130 Hercules aircraft for aerial surveys. The first shipment of supplies arrived at Moro Airport on 3 March. Four days later the country pledged a further 1,000,000 US$ in support of vulnerable women and children in the earthquake-affected areas, as well as three CH-47 Chinook helicopters and additional Australian Defence Force personnel.
The New Zealand government sent two Lockheed C-130 Hercules planes carrying hygiene kits, shelter supplies, water containers and tarpaulins. The government of China donated over 2.8 million kina (about 880,000 US$) in the weeks after the disaster. On 8 March 40 electricity generators were delivered from Israel.
The Red Cross released $221,000 in funds and announced it would send first aid, water, mosquito nets and shelters to the stricken areas. ExxonMobil donated $1,000,000 to relief efforts, and allowed the government to use its experts, resources and helicopters in the recovery process, while Santos Limited released a total of $1,200,000 to the Hela Provincial Hospital and aid agencies working in Papua New Guinea. Bank South Pacific donated 1 million kina (about 310,000 US$) to the emergency relief and reconstruction fund.
By 16 March, the total amount of cash donations had reached 150 million kina (about 46 million US$), with the government announcing it had already committed about one third of them to humanitarian aid and road reconstruction.

Here's to the State of Mississippi

"Here's to the State of Mississippi" is a civil rights protest song by Phil Ochs, an American topical singer and songwriter in the 1960s. Ochs is best known for his anti-war and freedom songs. "Here's to the State of Mississippi" was released in 1965 as the last track on his album "I Ain't Marching Anymore". The song criticizes the state of Mississippi for its mistreatment of African Americans. He points out various problems with the social constructs that allowed for oppression of the race. Jim Crow laws and white supremacy in the South fueled an imbalance in the civil structure of the state. "Here's to the State of Mississippi" touches on various issues like segregation, corrupt and biased school systems, and the negligence and crookedness of society and of government officials.
Ochs was inspired to write this song following a visit to the state as a volunteer for the Mississippi Caravan of Music. The Caravan worked in conjunction with Freedom Summer, a volunteer-based campaign that began in June 1964. The campaign aimed to register black voters in a place where the voting rights for blacks were nearly non-existent. The Caravan supported the mission of Freedom Summer through motivational songs and participation in campaign projects throughout the state.
Ochs was deeply affected by what he saw and experienced in Mississippi. One incident in particular that shook the Freedom Summer campaign were the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. Within the first month of the Freedom Summer campaign, civil rights activists, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were arrested in Philadelphia, Mississippi. The three were released after a few hours. However, as they drove through Neshoba County, Mississippi later that day, they were pulled over again and abducted by officers working with the Ku Klux Klan. The three were reported missing and an FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) investigation began with a large-scale search of the area. The investigation revealed that the activists were beaten and shot to death. Their bodies were found buried beneath a dam.
Ochs sings, "If you drag her muddy rivers, nameless bodies you will find," which refers to the FBI's search for Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. While searching for the three civil rights activists, Navy divers and FBI agents found the mangled bodies of Charles Eddie Moore and Henry Hezekiah Dee, both 19-year-old men who had been kidnapped, beaten and tortured, and then dropped alive into the Mississippi River by Klan members a month earlier. They also found the bodies of 14-year-old Herbert Oarsby and five other African Americans who remain unidentified; none of their kidnappings had attracted attention outside their local communities.
Adaptation.
Phil Ochs released the song "Here's to the State of Richard Nixon" as a single in 1974. Ochs replaces 'Mississippi' with 'Richard Nixon' in the lyrics. Additionally, Ochs changes some verses to reflect criticisms about the Nixon administration.

Norbert Ferré

Norbert Ferré (born September 23, 1975) is a French magician and artist manager.
He has an international career with his humorous manipulation act One for Two, Two for One, which he can play in nine languages, and his talent as a show presenter. Technically, he is a specialist in the field of scene manipulation, in cards and balls.
In the popular French book "Magic for Dummies", he is one of the magicians cited in the chapter "Ten great characters of magic in France".
Biography.
First steps.
Born September 23, 1975 in Marseille of a sales manager father and a liberal nurse mother, he is the youngest of the two children of the family. He studied business, as well as sociology and psychology, and finished with a master's degree. Except for some small anecdotal food work, he will fully enter the workforce directly as a professional artist.
It was at the age of 11, in 1986, that Norbert Ferré attended the magician Christian Preston's show at La Ciotat: it was love at first sight for this art. The gift of a traditional box of magic for children, reading all the magic books he can find, will strengthen his passion. At the age of 14, he was accepted at the Magicians Club of Marseille, affiliated to the F.F.A.P. Fédération Française des Artistes Prestidigitateurs: the national French federation of conjuring artists), a club of which he will become a few years later the president from 1998 to 2001. He used at the time the pseudonym Maginor that he will give up in the year 1999 to present himself since under his patronymic real.
Artistic background.
Very quickly, in the different domains of prestidigitation (see illusionism, 2.2), Norbert Ferré will choose that of manipulation. He began, in 1989, to mount an act he decided to present in 1991, at the first magic contest Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin de Blois (he still performs under the stage name Maginor), he there wins a second prize that will encourage him. He will receive, on this occasion, the advice of Pierre Brahma, the only French at the time who won the Grand Prix at the FISM (sort of the Olympic Games of conjuring held every three years). Norbert Ferré continues to work on his act and presents it this time in the national contest of the AFAP (formerly name of the FFAP) in Perpignan in 1999.
He wins the third prize of manipulation. He submitted his act to the 26th Convention of the Royal Club of Magicians of Brussels in Belgium (Circle 86 of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, commonly called I.B.M.), he won the second place in the category of Manipulation. Six months later, he won the same prize at the 22nd FISM convention in Lisbon. Having finished his studies, he chose to opt for the profession of an illusionist.
In September 2000, he became the first French artist to be invited by the international convention of magic organized by Tenyo. At this period, he played his shows in festivals and conventions of magic.
In 2003, at the 23rd FISM convention in The Hague in July, he won a first prize in the handling category and won the Grand Prix general in all categories, becoming "World Champion".
He will not compete anymore. In France, he will continue to perform in many festivals and magic conventions and will be, among others, one of the artists of the tour "The Night of Magic" programmed in many cities of the country. He will also be hired by the Crazy Horse (he will also be selected for tours abroad cabaret, the "Forever Crazy Horse Tour" in Spain, Russia...). He is now also called a lot abroad; he will travel all over the world while performing in big cabarets, the important magic festivals. He will also perform in circuses. Finally, he will be seen in TV shows around the world.
Prizes and awards.
At the end of June 2000, he won the second place in manipulation at the 26th convention of the Royal Magicians Club of Brussels and at the 22nd FISM convention in Lisbon.
In 2001, he received in Las Vegas the Originality Award of the "World Magic Seminar 2001" and in December of the same year, The Magic Circle of London inducted him in the M.I.M.C. (Membership of the Inner Magic Circle with a gold star), the highest degree for its members.
In 2002, the Academy of the Magic Arts awarded him a Mandrake d’or in Paris.
In 2003, at the 23rd FISM convention in The Hague, he became World Champion in the handling category and won the Grand Prix in all categories.
The FISM Grand Prix was the last contest in which he participated, since then he has performed at the most famous festivals, conventions or cabarets around the world, and continues to receive honorary awards, such as those below.
Honorary Prizes.
In October 2003, the FFAP awarded him the gold medal « Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin » at the Aix-les-Bains Congress.
On July 5, 2005, he received the « Medal of the City of Marseille ».
Other significant awards include in the US, The Excellence Award (The Florida State Magicians' Club - Magic on the Beach XIII) or, in Spain: 2014 commemorative plaque conferred by the city of Tamarite de Litera in Spain (Pro-Tamarit Collective - Encuentro Nacional de Magos Florences Gili).
Synopsis of the act.
The synopsis resumes a parody principle of "Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde", somewhat in line with Jerry Lewis's "Dr. Jerry and Mister Love".
On a stage with minimal decoration (a pedestal table with a box marked "Surprise," a sign on which we read "Prediction"). Norbert Ferré will play two characters: the host, debonair, funny and clumsy, and the magician, very serious and skillful. The act begins with the host, whose task is to make the time pass pleasantly while waiting for the arrival of the great magician. This will be the occasion of some jokes, and a few taps, the host being very proud of his new shoes and holding to draw attention to them. After a tour of himself of the artist, the "great magician" is revealed: the act is no longer spoken, we hear, in the background, an excerpt from the musical "A Fiddler on the roof", and then begins a series of manipulations, flourishes, magical effects and great dexterity with balls and cards, for a few minutes.
The routine ends, the artist does again a turn on himself, and the first character, the debonair, makes his appearance again. This one goes to look for the sign prediction and returns it: what is marked surprises the spectators, who understands to have been handled. After some new jokes, the "great magician" is once again appearing for a new demonstration of dexterity. After this, one last time, we find the good-natured character, who will reveal the contents of the box with marked "surprise": again, the public will be surprised by what the box contains, and that is, in fact, an ultimate Magic trick. The act ends with some last touches of humour...
The act combines magical effects and exploits on frills to acting, a theatralization, following a precept known illusionists statement by Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin: « The magician is a comedian who plays the role of a magician ».
Additional activities.
Norbert Ferré occasionally writes articles for magician's magazines, such as The FFAP's magazine of conjuring.
Since 19 March 2012, he has been president of the association "MAGEV - Charity magic," a foundation whose aim is to offer shows, balloon sculpting workshops, etc., to children who have experienced life (illness, abuse, etc.), and to adults with disabilities.

Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences

The Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences () is a structural unit in the Language and Literature Section of History and Philology Department of the Russian Academy of Sciences. This Institute is one of the major centers in the field of linguistic research in Russia, and is also a center for the Moscow School of Comparative Linguistics.
Researchers of the Institute of Linguistics are involved in the study of fundamental linguistic problems as well as in applied linguistic studies of the languages of Russia, the Commonwealth of Independent States and foreign countries too. These include Romance, Germanic, Celtic, Iranian, Turkic, Mongolian, Finno-Ugriс languages and languages of the Caucasus region, Tropical Africa and South-Eastern Asia.
Great attention is paid to the problems of linguistic typology and comparative and historical linguistics. Much attention is given to the research of psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic problems (language situation, language policy, language conflicts) in different regions of the world.
History.
The Institute of Linguistics of the USSR Academy of Sciences was created in 1950 in Moscow after the so-called “discussion of linguistic issues” during the campaign against the Marrism (Japhetic theory). The Institute was organized on the basis of the Institute of the Russian Language of the Academy of Sciences, established in 1944, as a "counterweight" to the Marr Institute of Language and Mind in Leningrad, the leading center of theoretical language studies in the USSR of that period. The latter in 1952 was reorganized as the Leningrad branch of the Moscow Institute of Linguistics (this situation continued until 1991, when the Leningrad branch was transformed into an independent Institute of Linguistic Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences).
The first Director of the Moscow Institute of Linguistics was Viktor Vinogradov, in 1954 this position was taken by his deputy, Аcademician Viktor Borkovskiy; Viktor Vinogradov became the Director of a renewed Institute of the Russian Language in 1958. Later Institute of Linguistics was headed by acad. Boris Serebrennikov (1960—1964), corr.-member Fedot Filin (1964—1968), corr.-member Viktoria Yartseva (1968—1977), acad. Georgiy Stepanov (1977—1986), corr.-member of Vadim Solntsev (1986—2000), corr.-member Viktor Vinogradov (2000—2012).
On June 19, 2012, Vladimir Alpatov became the Director of the Institute of Linguistics, as elected by general meeting of all the researchers of the Institute.
On May 25, 2017, Andrej Kibrik was elected the Director of the Institute of Linguistics by the general meeting of the researchers.
Administration.
The Institute is headed by the Direction: 
The Director also presides over the Scientific Council of the Institute.
Structure.
The structure of the scientific divisions of the Institute includes one Research Center, 8 Research Departments, the Department for international relations and the Department for the scientific personnel training. In 2002 the Department of Foreign Languages has been included in the structure of the Institute. In 2012 the Psycholinguistics Sector was transformed into the Department of Psycholinguistics comprising the General Psycholinguistics Sector and the Ethnopsycholinguistics Sector.
The Institute's subdivisions:
There are also a secretariat, an administrative and management apparatus and an economic department.
Directions of scientific research.
The Institute’s directions of research include:
Projects.
Researchers of the Institute are involved in the preparation of a multi-volume encyclopaedia "Languages of the World" (14 volumes have already been published). A three-volume encyclopaedia of the languages of Russia and the ex-USSR countries has been published.
Joint international research is conducted in cooperation with scientific institutions of France, the USA, Canada, Spain, Germany, Vietnam and other countries.
The Institute provides practical assistance in the development of literary oral and writing norms for rare and revitalized languages (for example, the Saami language).
Scientists of the Institute of Linguistics of the Russian Academy of Sciences have created the "Linguistic Encyclopedic Dictionary", the first edition of which was published in 1990 with Viktoria Yartseva as the chief editor (the 2nd edition, 2002). In 1995, the main authors and editors of this encyclopaedia were awarded the State Prize in the field of science and technology.

<doc id="56685606" url="?curid=56685606" title="Latin word order">
Latin word order

Latin word order is relatively free. The subject, object, and verb can come in any order, and an adjective can go before or after its noun, as can a genitive such as "of the enemy". A common feature of Latin is hyperbaton, in which a phrase is split up by other words: "it is Sextus Tarquinius".
A complicating factor in Latin word order is that there are variations in the style of different authors and between different genres of writing. In Caesar's historical writing, the verb is much likelier to come at the end of the sentence than in Cicero's philosophy. The word order of poetry is even freer than in prose, and examples of interleaved word order (double hyperbaton) are common.
In terms of word order typology, Latin is classified by some scholars as basically an SOV (subject-object-verb) language, with preposition-noun, noun-genitive, and adjective-noun (but also noun-adjective) order. Other scholars, however, argue that the word order of Latin is so variable that it is impossible to establish one order as more basic than another.
Although the order of words in Latin is comparatively free, it is not random but frequently different orders indicate different nuances of meaning and emphasis. As Devine and Stephens, the authors of "Latin Word Order", put it: "Word order is not a subject which anyone reading Latin can afford to ignore. . . . Reading a paragraph of Latin without attention to word order entails losing access to a whole dimension of meaning."
Influence on meaning.
Studying word order in Latin helps the reader to understand the author's meaning more clearly. For example, means more than "Trimalchio clapped his hands", but the initial verb implies a sudden action: "Trimalchio suddenly clapped his hands". In another sentence, the initial verb functions as a topic: does not mean merely "Corellius Rufus has died" but rather "The person who has died is Corellius Rufus." In another sentence, the initial verb is emphatic: means more than "I saw the forum" but "with my own eyes, I saw the forum".
The placement of adjectives also affects the emphasis. Thus, , with the possessive before the noun, means not "my fame" but "my "own" fame," and , with the number at the end of the sentence and separated from its noun, does not mean only "five ships were burnt" but "no fewer than five ships were burnt."
The use of hyperbaton (separation of words that normally go together) is also worth observing. Thus, Caesar's , with separated from and at the end of the sentence, means not "These floods remained for several days" but "This time, the flood waters, unlike the previous ones, remained for several days."
Theoretical approaches.
In the past 100 years, especially since the advent of computerised texts, Latin word order has been extensively studied with a view to elucidating the principles on which it is based. Two major recent works on Latin word order, based on different approaches, are those of Devine and Stephens (2006) and Olga Spevak (2010).
It is generally agreed that pragmatic factors play a major role in Latin word order, such as topic and focus, contrast, emphasis, and heaviness. The topic (what is being talked about) it often at the beginning of the sentence, with the focus (what is said about the topic) being at the end or in the penultimate position.
Other factors that play a role in word order are semantic (for example, adjectives of size usually precede the noun, and those of material more often follow it). In some Latin authors, consideration of such matters as euphony, assonance, and rhythm is also important.
One major area of disagreement is how far syntax plays a role in word order. According to Devine and Stephens (2006), Latin has a basic neutral word order, which they state is as follows:
A "non-referential object" goes closely with the verb and makes a phrase with it like in the phrase "to make an attack".
Following the theories of generative grammar, Devine and Stephens assume that deviations from that basic unmarked order are made to put emphasis on different elements. They use the term "scrambling" if constituents come in a different order from the basic one, and they assume that scrambling occurs when an element is moved leftwards, towards the beginning of the sentence. Leftwards movement is called "raising".
Olga Spevak (2010), on the other hand, basing her work on theories of functional grammar, rejects that approach. She considers that there are so many deviations from the so-called neutral order between authors and even in the works of the same author that it is not possible to discover what the neutral order must be. Therefore, an approach insisting on a basic unmarked order "does not really help a Latinist to better understand Latin constituent order." She stresses that according to the principles of functional grammar, as outlined by the Dutch linguist Simon Dik, words take their positions in a sentence according to a certain template, not by being moved from elsewhere.
Harm Pinkster (1990a) also favours a pragmatic approach and writes: "there is no reason for assuming a SOV order in Classical Latin, nor is there one for assuming a SVO order by AD 400".
However, not all scholars are ready to dismiss syntactic factors entirely. J.G.F. Powell, in his review of Spevak's book, commented that "nobody has yet succeeded in unifying the insights of all the different scholarly approaches to the fascinating and peculiar problem of Latin word order". In his view, an approach that combines the various schools of thought on Latin word order "may succeed in finding a more satisfactory solution".
Topic and focus.
Several recent books, such as those of Panhuis and Spevak, have analysed Latin sentences from a pragmatic point of view. Syntactic approaches traditionally analyse a sentence into Subject and Predicate, but a pragmatic analysis considers a sentence from the point of view of Topic and Focus (or Theme and Rheme, as Panhuis (1982) puts it). This type of approach was also proposed by Sturtevant (1909), who referred to the topic as the "psychological subject".
As with Subject, Object and Verb, Topic and Focus can be arranged in different ways in a sentence.
Topic.
Types of topic.
The topic is the thing or person that is being talked about in the sentence. Spevak (2010) distinguishes various kinds of topic: discourse topic, sentence topic, sub-topic, future topic, theme, and so on. A sentence topic is one that picks up the immediately preceding context (e.g. below) and has precedence over the discourse topic ( below):
A topic will often take precedence over a conjunction, and the following word order where the topic (in this case the grammatical subject) precedes "when" is fairly common:
Topicless sentences.
Not every sentence has a topic, but some present information which is entirely new. Pinkster gives the following as an example:
Such sentences are sometimes called "presentative sentences" and often start with a verb.
Focus.
The focus is the new information, i.e. the message which is being conveyed to the listener.
Final focus.
Often in Latin the topic comes first, and then the focus. For example, in the sentence below, the topic is "in the bathhouse" (), which has been previously mentioned, and the sub-topic is the hot-room () (since it can be assumed that all bath-houses have a hot room); the new information is that Cicero has moved the hot room, and the place to which he has moved it:
Similarly, in the following example, the new information is the sumptuousness of the funerals in question:
In the following example, where the adverb "quickly" is placed early in the sentence, the main information is the action "took up arms"; the speed is subsidiary information (Devine and Stephens use the terms "nuclear focus" and "weak focus" for this):
Often the verb can be part of the topic, as in the following example. The new information, or focus, is the person who followed and the number of ships he brought:
Penultimate focus.
A very frequent place for the focus, however, is in penultimate position, just before the verb or another element. In the example below, Alba has been mentioned in the previous sentence, and the fact that cities have rulers can be assumed; the new information or focus is the name of the ruler at that time, Gaius Cluilius. In this sentence, as in the previous example, the verb itself acts as a topic:
When an unemphatic argument, neither focus nor topic, such as above, follows the focussed word in this way, it is known as a "tail".
In the following example the fact that northerly regions have winters is already known, and the new information is the fact that they come early:
In the following, the fire has already been mentioned; the new information is that it continued day and night, with the main emphasis on the fact that it was continuous:
In the following, the fact that the road has been measured can be assumed (Cicero has just mentioned the measurement); the new information is that he measured it himself:
Similarly in the following, the fact that orders were given has already been mentioned, and the fact that they were carried out can be assumed; the new information is that they were carried out quickly:
In the following, the sentence answers the unspoken question "What did the general do with all the money he found in the captured city?", the answer being "He sent it to Rome" (with "Rome" being the most important word):
Initial focus.
Occasionally, the focus can be given extra emphasis by being placed before the topic. In the following pair of sentences, the focus of one is at the beginning, and of the other at the end:
In the sentence below from Livy, the sentence topic ("that year") and discourse topic ("the war") are in the middle of the sentence. The fact that war was waged on both land and sea is a weak focus placed in penultimate position; but the new and surprising information is that the number of Roman legions was no fewer than 23, and this comes at the beginning of the sentence before the topic:
Emphatic topics.
In the following sentence with antithesis, two topics, "the land journey" and "the journey by sea", are contrasted. Because they are contrasted, the topics are more emphatic than the focus:
Similar is the following, where the contrasted topics are "when I was a young man" and "now that I am an old one":
Devine and Stephens refer to such emphatic topics used contrastively as "co-focus".
Another example is the following, where the phrase "this place" (namely the city of Laurentum which was mentioned in the previous sentence) is in the emphatic penultimate position, as though it were the focus:
No recordings exist of Latin from the classical period, but it can be assumed that differences in emphasis in Latin were shown by intonation as well as by word order.
Euphony and rhythm.
Euphony and rhythm undoubtedly played a large part in Roman writers' choice of word order, especially in oratory, but also in historians such as Livy. Statements from the writers themselves make it clear that the important consideration was the clausula or rhythm of the final few syllables of each clause.
Cicero himself, commenting on a speech of the tribune Gaius Carbo, quotes the sentence below, which apparently caused the audience to burst into shouts of approval:
He notes that the sentence would be ruined rhythmically if the word order of the last three words were changed to . What was apparently admired here was the clausula of with its double trochaic – u – – rhythm; whereas would make a rhythm of u u u –, which Cicero says would produce an unsatisfying effect in Latin, despite being recommended by Aristotle.
In another passage from the same work, Cicero criticises a sentence from the orator Crassus on the grounds that it sounds like a line of iambic poetry. To avoid this, he says it would be better if the sentence ended (– u – – –) rather than (– – – u –).
The 1st-century A.D. teacher of oratory, Quintilian, remarks that hyperbaton (switching words round) is often used to make a sentence more euphonious. He gives the example of the following sentence from the opening of Cicero's :
Quintilian says that would be correct, but "harsh and inelegant".
In another place he says that to end a sentence with the verb is best, because the verb is the most forceful part of the sentence (); but if putting a verb finally is rhythmically harsh, the verb is frequently moved.
Another example where euphonic considerations may have played a part in word order is the following, from a letter by Pliny the Younger:
Since was pronounced , the unusual order with the demonstrative following the noun produces a favourite double cretic clausula (– u – – u –). There is also a pleasing assonance of the vowels "a-u-i a-u-i" in the last three words.
Individual style.
Another factor affecting word order was the individual style of different authors. Devine and Stephens note for example that Livy is fond of putting the object after the verb at the end of the clause (e.g. "he placed a camp", rather than , which Caesar preferred).
Other differences between authors have been observed. For example, Caesar frequently places a number after a noun (in about 46% of cases), but this is rarer in Cicero (only 10% of cases).
Verb position.
Several scholars have examined Latin sentences from a syntactic point of view, in particular the position of the verb.
Final verb.
In sentences with Subject, Object, and Verb, any order is possible. However, some orders are more common than others. In a sample of 568 sentences of Caesar containing all three elements examined by Pinkster, the proportions were:
An example of the typical Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) word order in Caesar is:
A dependent infinitive, such as "to be killed" below, also in Caesar usually precedes its verb:
However, in other genres of Latin, especially more colloquial types such as the comic dialogues of Plautus, Cicero's letters, or Petronius's satiric novel, the final position for the verb is much less common. comments: "In certain texts the medial position of the verb seems more normal than the final."
Linde (1923) counted the verb final clauses in various texts and produced the following figures for clauses with verbs in the final position:
In all authors, the verb tends to be final more often in subordinate clauses than in main clauses.
Over the centuries, verb-final main clauses became less common. In the writing of Egeria (Aetheria) of about A.D. 380, only 25% of main clauses and 37% of subordinate clauses are verb-final.
The verb "I am" (or its parts) is an exception to the rule that verbs tend to come at the end of the sentence in Caesar and Cicero. According to one investigation, in Caesar, when the verb is , only 10% of main clauses end with the verb. With other verbs, the figure is 90%.
In Cicero the verb is used at the end of a sentence slightly more often, in 20%–35% of main clauses. However, this is less than with other verbs, for which the figure is 55%–70%.
The above figures apply to sentences where is used as in independent verb (e.g. "it is difficult"), rather than as an auxiliary to another verb (e.g. "he set out"), when it frequently ends the clause.
Different authors have different preferences. In Sallust, who has a rather conservative style, the verb (except where existential) tends to go at the end of the sentence. Cato also usually puts the verb finally, except in specificational and identity sentences, such as the following:
Penultimate verb.
Quite commonly, especially in certain authors such as Nepos and Livy, the verb can come in penultimate position, followed by the object, as in this example:
This stylistic feature, consisting of Verb + Object at the end of a clause, is referred to by Devine and Stephens as "V-bar syntax". It is much less common in Caesar than in Livy. In Caesar the phrase "placed a camp" always comes in that order, but in Livy it is found as in 45 out of 55 examples (82%).
Even in Caesar, however, a locative phrase may occasionally follow a verb of motion, especially when the locative is focussed:
Other prepositional phrases can also sometimes follow the verb:
Other types of phrases which can sometimes follow a verb are relative clauses:
Dependent clauses with almost always follow the verb:
Another kind of situation where the verb commonly comes in penultimate position is when it is followed by a strongly focussed negative pronoun such as "no one" or "anyone":
The grammatical subject can come after the verb in sentences of the following kind where it is focussed, and the verb itself forms part of the topic:
Similarly in sentences such as the following, it is reasonable to suppose that the object is focussed:
This type of sentence where the focus is on the object at the end should be distinguished from sentences with V-bar syntax such as "he drew a circle round the king" mentioned above, in which the object is not focussed.
Initial verb.
Sudden actions.
Initial verbs are often used in sentences such as the following, which describe a sudden or immediate consequence of a previous event:
Such sentences are of a type known as "thetic" sentences, which answer "What happened?" rather than "What did the subject do?" Frequently they are in the historic present tense (in Caesar the historic present is six times as common in verb-initial sentences as the perfect tense).
Sometimes, even if the verb does not come at the beginning of the sentence, the suddenness of the action can be shown by placing it earlier in its clause. Thus the final words of this sentence, which would normally be "they make an attack from higher ground", are changed to to emphasise the element of surprise:
Agentless verbs.
The agent of the verb in thetic sentences tends to be less important than the verb; consequently, verb-initial sentences often have a verb in the passive voice. In Caesar, the passive verb ("is sent") is much commoner sentence-initially than ("he sends"):
Intransitive verbs of the type called unaccusative verbs, that is, verbs which have no voluntary agent, such as "remain", "grow", "stand", "be open", "flow or spread", also often begin thetic sentences:
Situations.
Thetic sentences with initial verb can also be explanatory or give background information:
Presentational verbs.
Presentational verbs (e.g. "there was") are also usually sentence-initial:
The kind of verbs that typically present new information in this way are such verbs as "there was", "there occurred", "there came".
Emphatic verb.
A verb at the beginning of the sentence is often emphatic, perhaps expressing something surprising:
Another situation favouring initial verb position is where the verb is in contrastive focus (antithesis), as in the following:
The verbs also come initially in sentences like the one below, in which there is a double antithesis. These are examples of sentences with initial focus (see above):
Another reason for using a sentence-initial verb is when the speaker is emphatically asserting the truth of a fact:
Verbs with meanings such as "move", "offend", "make anxious" etc., known as "psych" verbs, also often come sentence-initially. In Livy, the verb ("moved") frequently (although not always) comes first if it is used in the metaphorical sense:
But when the sense is literal, it always come finally:
Verb as topic.
Another reason for putting the verb first is that it represents the topic of the sentence, while the grammatical subject which follows it is the focus. For example, after mentioning that he has been upset by the death of someone, Pliny goes on to say:
Other examples of this are given above in the section on topic and focus.
Questions and imperatives.
An initial verb can also be used (without emphasis) in yes-no questions:
Imperatives also often (but not always) come at the beginning of a sentence:
The verb "to be".
The verb ("I am") can be used as an auxiliary verb (e.g. "he was killed"), as a copula (e.g. "he was rich") or as an existential verb, specifying the existence of something.
Existential.
As an existential verb, (or its past tense ) often goes at the beginning of the sentence. These sentences are also called "presentative" sentences, that is, sentences which serve to introduce new entities into the discourse.
Of these two orders, the first (with the locative phrase between the verb and the noun) is by far the most common. The second example above is unusual in that it does not present new information but merely reminds the reader of what has already been said ("There was a valley, as mentioned above...").
In other sentences, the verb or follows the word which it is presenting, or comes in the middle of a phrase in hyperbaton:
Location.
The verb can also specify the location of a thing or person and can equally come at the beginning or end of the sentence:
Copula.
When is a copula, it tends to be unemphatic and to be placed after a stronger word, or between two strong words:
This strong word which follows can also be the subject:
It is also possible for the subject to follow the copula:
Or the order may be Adjective, Subject, Copula:
When the sentence is negative, however, the verb tends to follow and is often clause-final:
Auxiliary.
When is an auxiliary, it normally follows the participle which it is used with:
Sometimes, however, the auxiliary can be placed earlier to follow some significant item of information, such as a quantity phrase or focussed word:
In subordinate clauses the auxiliary is frequently placed directly after the conjunction or relative pronoun:
But if there is a focus word following the conjunction or relative pronoun, the auxiliary follows that:
In a negative sentence, the auxiliary tends to follow the word . can either precede or follow the participle:
For "he did not dare", Latin writers use all three orders: , , , but the first of these is the most common:
Adjective position.
In Latin, an adjective can either precede or follow its noun: for example, "a good man" can be both or . Some kinds of adjectives are more inclined to follow the noun, others to precede, but "the precise factors conditioning the variation are not immediately obvious".
In Caesar and Cicero, it has been found that the majority (60%–80%) of ordinary adjectives, not counting pronominals and numerals, precede their nouns.
Factors affecting adjective position.
Semantic.
One factor affecting the order is semantic. As a general rule, adjectives which express an inherent property of the noun, such as "gold" in "gold ring", tend to follow it. Where the adjective is more salient or important than the noun, as "Appian" in "Appian Way" (), it also tends to follow it.
Adjectives which express a subjective evaluation, such as "serious", on the other hand, usually go before the noun. Adjectives of size and quantity also usually precede (in 91% of examples in Caesar, 83% in Cicero), as do demonstrative adjectives such as "this" and "that" (99% in Caesar, 95% in Cicero).
Adjectives where there is a choice between two alternatives, such as "left" or "right", or "preceding" and "following", also tend to go before the noun. However, the opposite order (e.g. "with left hand", Catullus 12) is also found.
Contrast and focus.
Other factors such as focus and contrast may also affect the order. When there is contrastive focus the adjective will precede, even if it is one such as a geographical name which normally follows:
Even when the contrast is not explicit, a strong focus may cause the adjective to come first:
On the other hand, an adjective which normally precedes, such as a number, can follow the noun when it is focussed or emphasised:
Contrast the following, where the emphasis is on :
A descriptivrelative clause can be brought forward in the same way as an adjective. In the following sentence, Caesar says the Gauls outside the defences were in confusion, and those inside the defences equally so. The antithesis puts emphasis on the underlined phrase:
Diachronic change.
Over time the position of adjectives can be seen changing, for example, between Cato the Elder (2nd century BC) and Columella (1st century AD). Adjectives describing the type of something, such as "wooden", "designed for oil" or "new" always follow the noun in Cato, but can come either before or after in Columella.
In Cato, the adjective "big" follows its noun in 7 out of 9 examples, e.g. "big storms", but in Caesar about 95% of examples go before the noun.
Livy uses this antique word order at a dramatic moment in his history when he reports the words of the magistrate announcing the news of the disaster at the battle of Lake Trasimene in 217 BC:
Another adjective which changes over time is "all". In Cato this word goes before or after the noun with equal frequency, but in Cicero's speeches 80% of the time it precedes, and in Caesar it goes before the noun even more commonly.
Stylistic preferences.
As with other aspects of word order, stylistic preferences also play a part in adjective order. For example, the adjective in its literal sense of "higher" (e.g. "from a higher place") usually comes after the noun in Cicero and in Caesar, but in Livy the position before the noun () is much commoner. Vitruvius and Seneca the Younger also preferred the earlier position.
Commonly used phrases.
In certain commonly used phrases, the adjective comes after the noun without variation: 
In others, the position after the noun is more common but not fixed. The phrase "civil war" has the adjective following in about 60% of Cicero's examples.
In other commonly used phrases, the adjective always comes first. These include certain terms of relative position and certain adjectives of time:
In other common phrases, such as "at first light", the adjective usually comes first, but is also found.
Hyperbaton.
Often adjectives are emphasised by separating them from the noun by other words (a technique known as hyperbaton). This is especially true of adjectives of size and quantity, but also superlatives, comparatives, demonstratives, and possessives.
Premodifier hyperbaton.
Often the adjective precedes the noun:
The separation can sometimes be a long one:
Premodifying adjectives in hyperbaton often have focus or contrastive emphasis. In the following example, "these particular" floods are contrasted with some earlier ones which lasted a shorter time:
Sometimes they are merely brought to the front to emphasise them. So in the following example, the adjective "bloody" is raised to the beginning of the sentence to highlight it and make it stand out:
Sometimes both the noun and the adjective are important or focussed:
This last sentence is an example of double hyperbaton, since "everyone's minds" is an example of genitive hyperbaton.
Postmodifier hyperbaton.
Hyperbaton is also possible when the adjective follows the noun. Often with postmodifier hyperbaton, the noun is indefinite:
If the noun is definite, the adjective can be predicative:
Sometimes the noun, not the adjective, is focussed, and the adjective is a mere tail, as in the following:
Numbers.
Cardinal numbers tend to come before the noun in Cicero (90% of examples), but in Caesar only 54% come before the noun. When following the noun, the numeral is often focussed, as in the following, where the important information is in the number "three":
Distributive or numerals usually precede the noun, both in Cicero and Caesar:
Ordinals precede the noun in 73% of Caesar's examples. But when used with , they follow:
Possessive adjectives.
Personal possessives.
Possessive adjectives, such as "my", "his/their", are fairly evenly distributed (68% preceding in Caesar, 56% in a sample of Cicero speeches). When a possessive follows the noun it is unemphatic:
When it is more emphatic, or in contrastive focus, it precedes:
However, the possessive adjective preceding the noun is not always emphatic: when it is tucked away between two more emphatic words it is usually unemphatic:
It is also usual for the possessive to precede the noun when vocative:
and.
The 3rd person genitive pronouns, "his" and "their", tend to precede their noun in Caesar (in 73% of instances). Unlike the possessive adjectives, however, there is often no particular emphasis when they are used before a noun:
With certain nouns, such as "his brother" or "his friend", however, the position after the noun is slightly more usual.
Pronominal adjectives.
Pronominal adjectives are those which can serve both as pronouns and adjectives, such as "this", "another", "a certain (man)" and so on. These adjectives generally have genitive singular and dative singular .
The most frequent position for pronominal adjectives is before the noun.
Demonstratives.
Demonstratives, such as ("that") and ("this"), almost always precede the noun in both in Caesar (99%) and in Cicero's speeches (95%).
When it follows a noun in unemphatic position, can often mean "the aforementioned":
In the same way, when it follows a noun, can sometimes mean "that famous":
But more frequently, even when it means "the aforementioned", and also when it means "this one here", will precede the noun:
and.
The pronouns "another", "another (of two)", "any", and "no", when used adjectivally, precede the noun in most cases (93% in both Caesar and Cicero).
"in another place"
Occasionally, however, when emphatic, they may follow:
In the following, there is a chiasmus (ABBA order):
 in phrases such as ("Alexander himself") usually precedes the noun in Caesar, as also in Cicero, although Cicero's preference is not as strong.
and.
The word "a certain" can either precede or follow its noun: 
When it is used with a person's name, it always follows, or else goes between forename and surname:
In such a position it is unemphatic, and the emphasis is on the name.
The other indefinite pronoun, (the adjectival form of ), similarly can either follow or precede its noun:
Of these two, the phrase is slightly more common; and the phrase "somehow or other" is always in that order.
Stacked adjectives.
It is been noted that in various languages when more than one adjective precedes a noun, they tend to come in a particular order. In English the order usually given is: Determiner &gt; Number &gt; Opinion &gt; Size &gt; Quality &gt; Age &gt; Shape &gt; Colour &gt; Participle forms &gt; Origin &gt; Material &gt; Type &gt; Purpose (for example, "those two large brown Alsatian guard dogs"). In general an adjective expressing a non-permanent state (such as "hot") will go further from the noun than an adjective of type or material which expresses an inherent property of the object.
In Latin, when adjectives precede, they generally have the same order as in English: 
When the adjectives follow, the opposite order is usually used:
There are some apparent exceptions, however, such as the following, in which the adjective "luxurious" is placed next to the noun:
The demonstrative "this" normally goes before a number, as in English. However, the reverse order is also possible:
When follows a noun, it goes close to it:
Adjectives of the same semantic class are usually joined by a conjunction in Latin:
Quite commonly also, one adjective precedes and another follows, as in:
Preposition, adjective, noun.
When a preposition, adjective and noun are used together, this order is the most common one (75% of Caesar's examples):
More rarely, a monosyllabic preposition may come between an adjective and noun in hyperbaton:
However, this is mainly true only of the prepositions , , , and and mainly with interrogatives and relatives and a limited number of adjectives.
The order preposition, noun, adjective is also less common:
Genitive position.
Possessive genitive.
Just as with adjectives, a genitive such as "of the enemies" can either precede or follow its head-noun. Thus for "camp of the enemies", both and are found. Overall, however, there is a slight tendency for a genitive to come after a noun in both Caesar and Cicero (57% of examples).
Individual preferences play a part in genitive position. In Livy books 1–10, "the camp of the enemies" (74% of examples) is more common than . Caesar, on the other hand, seems to prefer (69% of examples). But when a name is used with , Caesar usually puts it after the noun (86% of examples), for example "Labienus's camp".
Relationship terms.
With relationship terms, such as "wife", the genitive can go either before or after the noun. Often when it follows, the genitive is unemphatic:
Often (but not always) when the genitive precedes, it is focussed:
One noun which almost always has a preceding genitive is "son/daughter":
Objective genitive.
When the genitive is an objective one, e.g. "hope of victory" or "the saviour of Asia", it normally follows the noun. However, considerations of focus or emphasis can cause it to precede:
Subjective genitive.
Subjective genitives can precede or follow the noun. For example, with "memory", a subjective genitive usually (but not always) precedes:
However, with "hope", a subjective genitive usually follows, unless focussed:
If a phrase has both a subjective and objective genitive, the subjective one (whether it comes before or after the noun) will usually precede the objective one:
Partitive genitive.
Partitive genitives usually follow the noun:
However, the genitive can also sometimes precede, especially if it is a topic or sub-topic:
Adjective, genitive, noun.
Another place a genitive is often found is between an adjective and the head-noun, especially when the adjective is an emphatic one such as "all":
This also applies when a participle is used instead of an adjective:
The orders Adjective-Noun-Genitive and Adjective-Genitive-Noun are both common in Caesar and Cicero; but Genitive-Adjective-Noun is infrequent.
Enclitic words.
Typical enclitic words.
There are certain words that are enclitic: they always follow a stronger word. Examples are "for", "however, moreover", and "indeed", which virtually always come after the first full word of the sentence (not counting prepositions) and are never the first.
Other words that require a stronger word on which to lean are "also" and "indeed" and can never begin a sentence. Other words, such as "approximately" and , are frequently enclitic:
In the phrase "not even," the word generally follows the first word of the emphasised phrase, rather than the whole phrase:
Weak pronouns.
Personal pronouns such as "me" and "to me" can have weak and strong forms in Latin. When weak, they tend to be found early in the sentence either after the first word (which can be a conjunction such as "when" or "and") or after an enclitic such as , if present:
Contrast sentences like the following have the indirect object being a full noun and following the direct object (which Devine and Stephens consider to be the neutral word order):
Unlike true enclitics, however, pronouns can also sometimes begin a sentence:
As with the copula (see above), when a focus phrase or emphatic delayed topic phrase intervenes, the weak pronoun will usually follow it, rather than the first word of the sentence:
However, the pronoun is sometimes found in second position, and then follows the focussed phrase:
In the following example, the pronoun follows not the focused word but the conjunction "if":
In terms of transformational grammar, the sentence can be analysed as being derived from * by raising and to earlier in the sentence. A functionalist, on the other hand, would say that naturally comes first as the topic, then in its normal place, then the unemphatic pronoun, without anything being moved.

Wayne Peterson (racing driver)

Wayne Peterson (born May 24, 1938) is an American professional stock car racing owner/driver and former paratrooper and United States Army Special Forces member. He currently operates Wayne Peterson Racing, a team in the ARCA Menards Series.
Military career.
Peterson grew up in a poor family in Boaz, Alabama, and when he was 15 years old, his high school was visited by Army National Guard recruiters. Attracted by benefits of food and clothing, he enlisted and entered active duty at 16, but was sent back to school upon discovering his age. After graduating, he returned to the military and was stationed at Fort Bragg as a paratrooper in the XVIII Airborne Corps. Peterson was a member of the United States Army Parachute Team (Golden Knights), and worked with NASA on performing High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) landings.
He was later assigned to the Third United States Army for 30 days, during which he was placed in the 77th and attended Ranger School in Fort Benning, followed by survival training in Antarctica and language studies in California, the latter in which he learned French and Vietnamese. Peterson served in Germany and Okinawa with the 10th and 1st Special Forces Groups, respectively, before being deployed to Vietnam in 1963 as an advisor and eventually a combat role. He served multiple tours during the Vietnam War until 1972.
In 1961, Peterson trained Cuban refugees and participated in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. Two years later, he guarded President John F. Kennedy's body in the United States Capitol rotunda after his assassination. He also served as Richard Nixon and South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu's English/Vietnamese translator.
Peterson was scheduled to complete his service in 1980 when the government extended it by 13 months. He was ordered to Diego Garcia, where plans were made for Operation Eagle Claw, an effort to free United States embassy members in the Iran hostage crisis. However, the mission failed after two aircraft were destroyed during refueling. Peterson compared the debacle and resulting public backlash to that received by American troops withdrawing from Vietnam: "We had to abort, put our tail between our legs, same way we came out of Nam. We just didn't finish the job. [...] We had way too much TV coverage in Nam. The public don't need to know our missions; it messed with intelligence. Nam was a hard time, soldiers condemned for pulling the trigger. Of course, if you waited one second and thought about it, you were dead. We fought for the country, and our own survival. It wasn't pretty. You were there to save your people."
Racing career.
As a teenager, Peterson befriended a dirt track racing driver who would let him test his car. While he was stationed at Fort Bragg, he purchased a 1948 Hudson and converted it into a dirt track car. Peterson later joined NASCAR driver Lee Petty's crew as a gasman, followed by a tenure with Junior Johnson on the DiGard Motorsports team. As compensation, Johnson gave him a car, which he fielded for Lennie Pond at Talladega Superspeedway. He also competed in modified stock cars in the 1970s.
During the 1980s, he began competing in the Automobile Racing Club of America. In 1983, he entered the NASCAR Winston Cup Series' Atlanta Journal 500, but spun out during qualifying due to tire issues. The following year, he tried to qualify for the Daytona 500, but did not make the race after suffering an engine failure in his Twin 125 qualifier and finishing tenth in the consolation race.
Wayne Peterson Racing fields various cars in the ARCA Racing Series. Drivers included Tim Mitchell, a colorectal cancer survivor who raced for the team in the 2000s; Zachary Gibson, son of ARCA Midget Series racer Larry Gibson and grandson of Indianapolis 500 driver Todd Gibson, in 2009; and NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series driver Clay Greenfield in 2004. Greenfield, described by "The Leaf-Chronicle" as a "talented kid with no name", finished 12th in his series debut at Salem Speedway, marking the team's strongest finish since 1998. As of 2020, Tim Richmond, Steve Cronenwett and Jim Walker share the team's best race finish of ninth at Toledo Speedway and Talladega in 2004 as well as Toledo in 2020, respectively.
Personal life.
Peterson was married to Sarah Peterson and has three sons, Michael, Brian, and Kevin, and five grandchildren. Sarah died in February 2008. Peterson currently resides in Pulaski, TN.

Sahiyo

Sahiyo is a non-governmental organization founded in 2015 whose purpose is to advocate women rights and end the practice of female genital mutilation, principally among the Ddawoodi Bohra community in India. The organization lists its main concerns as females being victims of social norms and old traditions, working to eliminate these traditions through media, proper education, collaboration with other human rights organizations and social discussions. Sahiyo aims to empower victims and help them to spread their stories through public awareness campaigns and advocacy initiatives.
History.
In early 2015, five women started the collective; Mariya Taher, Aarefa Johari, Priya Goswami, Insia Dariwala and Shaheeda Tavawalla-Kirtane, decided to take a step against female circumcision and create a collective, they managed to partner with national and international NGOs such as German-Iraqi NGO Wadi, SpeakOut, Breakthrough and others. 
In July, Sahiyo launched an exploratory online survey to understand the motive, expanse and effect of female circumcision around the world, significant researchers participated in the survey including Gerry Mackie. In June, they partnered with Breakthrough to uncover the different connections of violence that are based on gender by highlighting the effects of orthodox ethics and customs that suppresses female sexuality in specific communities.
In August 2016, convened a media workshop in partnership with IAWRT. In September, Sahiyo collaborated with Inclusive Mosque Initiative, they participated in the "Gender Justice" session at the Islamic Society of North America Annual Conference. In October, Sahiyo participated in lecturing, discussing and collaborating over female genital mutilation challenges at Justice and Peace Commission in Mumbai which is run by Catholic Church in Mumbai.
In January 2017, Sahiyo launched a worldwide online petition on Change.org appealing to United Nations and other establishments to invest in more research and support to push to end female genital mutilation in India and Asia and then to eliminate it globally, the petition was launched in collaboration with 33 non-governmental human rights organizations, including Equality Now, Orchid Project, and Tahirih Justice.
Approach.
'Sahiyo' is the Gujarati word for 'friends', which indicates the collective's mission to end female genital cutting through social discussions with the community in order to reach collaborative solutions towards ending the practice. Advocating its views against female genital cutting, Sahiyo uses online media to present stories of women who undergone mutilation to spread awareness of female circumcision, often drawing special attention to survivor stories. Sahiyo started its first "Thaal Pe Charcha" (Discussions over food) in 2017, a meeting for Bohra women to discuss their life challenges concerning social norms and community fear of women sexuality, with an emphasis on female genital mutilation. In July, Sahiyo held the second Thaal Pe Charcha meeting in Mumbai, the third meeting was convened in October, in which the organization received an invitation for speaking at Hilton Humanitarian Symposium in Los Angeles on their recent work and engagement with local and global communities.
Research.
Through its local research, Sahiyo found that 80% of Bohra woman had undergone [[clitoridectomy]] procedure. It has also released an [[Investigative Journalism|investigative report]] revealed publicly for that first time that female mutilation cutting was carrying out in several parts of coastal state [[Kerala]], including cities of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] and [[Kozhikode]], the reporters and researchers interviewed clinic doctors who agree on the illegal procedure and also encourage it, which caused controversial reactions among supporters and opposers in India.
Campaigns.
In February 2016, Sahiyo partnered with NGO Speak Out to run "Each One Reach One", a one-month campaign was launched to motivate different people to participate in social discussions with Bohra women. In the following year, they have launched the second edition of the campaign. In March, they started "I Am Bohra Photo" campaign, encouraging women and men of Bohra to post their photos with comments to condemn khatna activities.

Kunga cake

Kunga cake or kungu is an East African food made of millions of densely compressed midges or flies. In his entomophagy book "Insects: An Edible Field Guide", Stefan Gates suggest that people can "make burgers with it, or dry it out and grate parts of it off into stews" for "umami richness". Bear Grylls calls it "a great survival food" and describes how vast quantities are caught and turned into kunga cake. American entomologist May Berenbaum discusses the situation where large swarms of midges can cause significant problems for local populations. She cites an example of how "Chaoborus edulis" swarms form near Lake Malawi and how the local people turn them into kunga cakes as a "rich source of protein" which is eaten "with great enthusiasm". Explorer David Livingstone (1865) claimed that they "tasted not unlike caviare" though Professor of Tropical Entomology Arnold van Huis declared that he did not like it at all.
To catch the flies a frying pan can be coated in cooking oil and then wafted through a swarm.

Unscented optimal control

In mathematics, unscented optimal control combines the notion of the unscented transform with deterministic optimal control to address a class of uncertain optimal control problems. It is a specific application of Riemmann-Stieltjes optimal control theory, a concept introduced by Ross and his coworkers.
Mathematical description.
Suppose that the initial state formula_1 of a dynamical system,
formula_2
is an uncertain quantity. Let formula_3 be the sigma points. Then sigma-copies of the dynamical system are given by,
formula_4
Applying standard deterministic optimal control principles to this ensemble generates an unscented optimal control. Unscented optimal control is a special case of tychastic optimal control theory. According to Aubin and Ross, tychastic processes differ from stochastic processes in that a tychastic process is conditionally deterministic.
Applications.
Unscented optimal control theory has been applied to UAV guidance, spacecraft attitude control, air-traffic control and low-thrust trajectory optimization
