Desolate (video game)

Desolate (stylized in all caps) is an open world first-person survival horror action-adventure video game developed by Nearga and published by HypeTrain Digital.
The game takes place on a fictional island named Granichny, where secret experiments resulted in a massive "mutation" of the world. The player assumes the role of a Volunteer, who must research the paranormal activities of the island, gathering information and undertaking dangerous tasks.
Gameplay.
"Desolate" is a survival game set in an open world environment. It contains a dynamic day and night cycle, and is played from a first-person perspective. Most of the gameplay is built around combat, exploration and campaign storyline progression. The game can be played either in single-player, or with up to four-player co-operative multiplayer.
The game’s combat is mostly melee-based, with ammo for firearms being very rare. Players can use different weapons, which can be found throughout Granichny, as well as gathered from enemies. The weapons can also be upgraded with different modifications. Players can repair their weapon a limited number of times.
The game tracks 5 main elements of survival: Health, Hunger, Thirst, Cold and Stress. While travelling around the game, players find various medical supplies, food and water, which can be used to restore the according element. Players can also find different crafting ingredients and blueprints, which allow them to create new items and equipment.
Throughout the game, players earn Experience Points (XP) by completing tasks and defeating enemies. After gathering enough XP, players earn a Skill Point - which can be used to unlock various abilities and enhancements in one of the 3 Skill Trees: Crafting, Fighting and Survival.
Plot.
"Desolate" takes place in Russia during the Soviet era. The game's prologue follows Victor Ognin, the founder of the New Light Conglomerate, as he commits an act of sabotage against his own company that will "change the world forever". Victor's actions release mutants and dangerous unnatural phenomena across the world. The epicenter of these events is the island of Granichny, off the coast of the Russian mainland. The day the world changed forever becomes known as "Day X", and Victor goes into hiding.
The main game takes place two years afterwards, with the player taking the role of a Volunteer, an agent of New Light assigned to explore Granichny on behalf of the Conglomerate in hopes of discovering a means to reverse the global damage caused by Victor. After performing various errands to gain the cooperation of the island's local population, the Volunteer is tasked by his handler, 400, to retrieve classified New Light documents. The documents reveal that New Light captured island locals and used them in human experimentation, including 400's wife and daughter, resulting in their deaths. 400's daughter, Lily, now haunts the island as a ghost that menaces the Volunteer on multiple occasions. Distraught, 400 abandons New Light and vanishes. Meanwhile, the Volunteer begins to receive mocking messages from a voice in his head that claims to be one and the same as him, and who possesses the ability to change either the Volunteer's perception of the world or the world itself, such as turning the world green or causing giant whales to swim through the sky.
The Volunteer is soon contacted by Eleanora, the leader of Pravda, an independent organization opposed to New Light that is attempting to uncover the truth behind Day X. While performing missions for Pravda, the Volunteer discovers that New Light has been deliberately converting captured locals into "Subject 47s", insane madmen who are then killed to harvest the unique moss growing in their bodies, which New Light uses as a fuel source. The Volunteer is convinced by this to turn against New Light and help Pravda broadcast a message revealing the truth to the world.
The Volunteer later learns that the spatial anomalies on the island are actually former humans who have been converted into anomalies by New Light's research. He meets Alice Ognin, Victor Ognin's daughter and a former New Light scientist, who turned herself into an anomaly in hopes this would convince her father to stop New Light's human experimentation. Alice begs the Volunteer to end her suffering, which the Volunteer does with a special device specifically designed to destroy anomalies.
Meanwhile, Pravda's headquarters are stormed by the Soviet secret police, and Eleanora and all other members of Pravda are summarily executed. 400 contacts the Volunteer and reveals that Victor Ognin is leading a breakaway splinter group of New Light headquartered in a heavily defended fortress stronghold on the island. The Volunteer decides to assassinate Ognin in the hopes of putting an end to New Light.
After infiltrating Ognin's bunker, the Volunteer confronts Ognin, who turns out to be a massive anomaly. The Ognin-Anomaly reveals it is the Voice inside the Volunteer's head. Speaking with the voices of the Voice: Victor Ognin, 400, and Eleanora, the Ognin-Anomaly explains that he accidentally destroyed the world on Day X, and altered reality to create a new world in his mind. All the people the Volunteer encountered were simply reflections of Ognin's consciousness, including the Volunteer himself, who is the embodiment of Victor's conscience and desire to correct his mistakes. Ognin informs the Volunteer that he is no longer needed, and compels him to shoot himself in the head. The Volunteer awakens back at his safe house, wondering how many times he's relived these events and how many more times they will occur. The game ends with a philosophical message from the development team thanking the player for supporting the game.
Development.
The core gameplay of "Desolate" is based on "Beyond Despair" - a game developed by Pixelmate, and released on January 16, 2017. Beyond Despair was not a commercial success, and Pixelmate was closed due to its financial situation.
A part of the old team created a new studio, with financial support by HypeTrain Digital, refining the gameplay from Beyond Despair, while adding new content. Most of the gameplay changes were directed by fan input. All Beyond Despair owners received a free copy of "Desolate".
The game was on Steam Early Access, and now the full version is available.

Austin Claunch

Austin Claunch (born November 17, 1989) is an American college basketball coach, and current head coach of the Nicholls Colonels men's basketball team. He is currently the youngest coach in the NCAA.
Playing career.
Claunch played four years at Emory, where he was a three-time First Team All-University Athletic Association selection, finishing his career with the Eagles as the school's all-time assists leader, and ranking eighth all-time in career points.
Coaching career.
After graduation, Claunch spent the 2012-13 season as the director of player development under Paul Hewitt at George Mason, and from 2013 to 2015 served as a graduate manager at Clemson before being named the assistant video services director for the Tigers for the 2015-16 season.
Claunch earned his first collegiate assistant coaching position at Nicholls State, joining Richie Riley's staff. After two seasons as an assistant, he was elevated to the head coaching position at Nicholls when Riley accepted the head coaching position at South Alabama.
Claunch was named the Colonels' 12th head coach on March 29, 2018.
Across two seasons at the helm, the Houston native has accumulated a 35-27 overall record along with a 22-16 mark in Southland Conference play, leading the Colonels to a ninth-place finish in 2018-19 before making a second-place run just a year later in 2019-20.
Notably, the Red &amp; Gray exceeded expectations during the 2019-20 campaign, upending the league's preseason 11th-place projection as the team secured 20-plus victories for just the fourth time in program history. Claunch &amp; Co. kicked off the year with some flair, nearly knocking off Illinois in the season opener before upsetting Pitt on the road just days later; additionally, the Colonels challenged both No. 23 LSU (10-point loss) and mid-major power Rhode Island (five-point loss) in their own houses, leading each on numerous occasions throughout the contests.
Claunch spent the 2016 and 2017 seasons as an assistant, contributing heavily to the Colonels historic 2017-18 campaign that included the most wins (21) since 1995 and best Southland Conference record (15-3) since 1998. 
"I am beyond excited to be named the next head basketball coach at Nicholls," Claunch said. "The people of this university and all of Thibodaux have embraced me and treated me like family since the first day I arrived two years ago. I am ready to give the community a winning program built on enthusiasm, accountability and hard work. The foundation has been laid, and the future is extremely bright. I am truly humbled and honored to be leading our basketball program into the next phase."
At Nicholls as an assistant, Claunch was primarily responsible for guard development, specifically point guards, working daily with seniors Roddy Peters (SLC Newcomer of the Year, First Team), Jahvaughn Powell (All-SLC Defensive Team), Lafayette Rutledge (Single-season 3-point record holder) and Tevon Saddler (All-SLC Second Team). He was also the key recruiter for Kevin Johnson and Ryghe Lyons, who both started over 15 games as freshmen.
Claunch's impact at Nicholls was immediately felt as it was his scout that helped the Colonels knock off Boston College 79-73 on Nov. 11, 2016. He worked closely with Riley on offensive and defensive schemes and gameplans. Claunch created, orchestrated and conducted all basketball camps for the Colonels over the past two years.
Claunch came to Nicholls after spending a season as Assistant Video Services Director for Clemson men’s basketball. Claunch spent three seasons with the Tigers overall, having previously served as a graduate manager from 2013-15. Prior to his time with Clemson, Claunch spent the 2012-13 season as the Director of Player Development for George Mason University.
Claunch was part of a Clemson staff that saw the Tigers improve by 10 wins over their previous season, compiling a 23-13 overall record. Clemson advanced to the NIT semifinals for the first time since 2007 and won 10 ACC games as well.
He helped Jaron Blossomgame to First Team All-ACC honors and the ACC's Most Improved Player award. The 6-7 forward raised his points-per-game average from 13.1 to 18.7 and his 3-point field goal percentage from 28% to 45% during his junior season. Claunch also helped K.J. McDaniels to a First Team All-ACC junior season. The 6-6 forward was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year and declared early for the 2014 NBA Draft.
At George Mason, Claunch worked under former Georgia Tech Head Coach Paul Hewitt. He assisted in all areas of individual workouts and practice, in addition to helping with film breakdown and exchange, scouting reports, academic scheduling and updating the team's recruiting database.
Claunch has assisted with various summer camps over the past several years. Each summer from 2007 to 2011, he worked with former NBA player and longtime Head Coach John Lucas at his camps in Houston, Texas. He also interned in the summer of 2010 with Joe Abunassar and Impact Basketball. From 2008-10, Claunch assisted his father's 15U and 16U Adidas Houston Select Basketball Club teams.
Claunch was a four-year starter and two-time captain at Emory University on the Division III level from 2008-12. He ranks first in Emory history in career assists (580), assists per game (5.8) and minutes played (3,132). Claunch is also second in free throw percentage (.877). He was also a three-time All-Conference First Team player at Emory, and a member of the University Athletic Association's 25th Anniversary Team. Claunch set the school's three best single-season assist totals over each of his final three seasons.
He played high school basketball at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory in Houston, Texas, and was a three-year starter and two-time team captain. Claunch was also a two-time all-district selection and led Strake Jesuit to the 2008 district crown as a senior. He was a two-time recipient of the Strake's Kenneth McGregor Award, based on his leadership and dedication on and off the court.
The Houston native earned his undergraduate degree in political science, with a minor in religion, from Emory in 2012. Claunch obtained a master's degree in human resource development from Clemson in August 2015.

FIFA Champions Badge

The FIFA Champions Badge is a kit-emblem in the shape of a gold and white shield, awarded by FIFA to the reigning world champions of FIFA competitions, both at national team level (e.g. World Cup, Women's World Cup, Futsal World Cup and FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup), and at club team level (e.g. Club World Cup).
FIFA owns, makes and licenses-out the physical badge, which can only be worn on first-term kits (not on derivative versions, or on training clothing), of the reigning titleholders, and is thus a temporary award. FIFA awarded the first badge in February 2008 to Milan, the then-reigning 2007 FIFA Club World Cup champions.
Award.
Badge rules.
The badge is shaped like a shield, and displays the image of the relevant trophy, with the inscription "FIFA WORLD CHAMPIONS", next to the year in which the relevant FIFA competition had been won. The badge only comes in two colour schemes – gold letters on a white background, and white letters on a gold background. The winning national team or club team carries the badge on their shirt until the end of the next edition of the relevant FIFA tournament; thus, it is only worn by reigning champions.
The badge can be displayed on kits from the day the team becomes FIFA world champions, up to and including the day of the final of the next staging of the competition (e.g. if the team wins the competition again, they can hold the badge uninterrupted). The badge can only be worn on the club's official first-team kits (both home and away versions) – being the team that won the relevant FIFA world competition – and cannot be worn on any derivative or retrospective form of these kits, or on any related club training clothing, or by the club's reserve teams/any other of the club's teams.
Commercial aspects.
The physical badge is manufactured by a third party on behalf of FIFA (by Unisport in 2019), and orders for the physical badge from kit manufacturers must go through FIFA; a logistical situation that created delays in consumers being able to purchase Nike-made kits of the United States women's national soccer team (USWNT) with the badge in 2019. There have also been concerns that major kit manufacturers such as Nike and Puma, have had issues licensing the FIFA Champions Badge for first-team kits that can be sold to the general public.
As well as the prestige, the award brings commercial benefits to the recipients through sales of kits that include the new FIFA badge.
Non-FIFA competitions.
A separate agreement is required to wear the badge in non-FIFA organised competitions. For example, in 2009, the English FA granted Manchester United, the reigning 2008 FIFA Club World Cup holders, permission to wear the badge during FA Cup fixtures but not in the Premier League, and a similar arrangement was sought for Liverpool when they became 2019 holders; however, the FA did grant the club the right to use the badge for one home Premier League fixture, against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 29 December 2019. In contrast, both Real Madrid and Barcelona were allowed to wear the FIFA Champions Badge on their shirts during all of their Spanish La Liga fixtures.
History.
Club teams.
The first official award of the badge was made in February 2008 to honour the reigning holders of the FIFA Club World Cup, Italian club Milan, who had won the title in 2007. At the time of the award to Milan, FIFA declared that the three previous winners of the FIFA Club World Cup, Corinthians, São Paulo, and Internacional, could also wear the badge until a new winner was crowned in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup Final in December. However, when Corinthians won the badge in the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup, FIFA confirmed that it was their first time officially earning the FIFA Champions Badge.
National teams.
In September 2008, the badge was extended to the FIFA World Cup and was presented to the defending champions from 2006, Italy, thus becoming the first national team to wear the badge. In 2009, the badge was extended to the FIFA Women's World Cup and awarded to Germany, reigning champions from 2007. The badge was further extended to the FIFA Futsal World Cup in 2012, where it was first won by Brazil. In 2013, the badge was added to the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, being first worn by Russia.

Ralph Taylor (divine)

Ralph Taylor (1647 – 26 December 1722) was an English clergyman, nonjuror and sometime chaplain to the court of James II at Saint-Germain-en-Laye.
Life.
Son of Revd William Taylor and Judith Charlett of South Littleton. Educated Trinity College Oxford, matriculated 22 March 1666 – 1667; BA 1670; MA 1673; BD 1682; DD 1686. Installed as rector of Grafton Flyford 1678, then in 1684 as rector of Severn Stoke. 
Some of the entries in the parish book of Severn Stoke written in Taylor's hand suggest that he had no great respect or honour for James II:
Having previously sworn an oath of allegiance to James II of England, he refused to take the oath of allegiance to William and was deprived of the living. Taylor remained in Worcestershire with some contact with George Hicks, nonjuring Dean of Worcester.
By 1699, Taylor was chaplain to the court of James II at Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Little is known of his time there beyond that he attended the funeral of Denis Granville, that he owned one or more telescopes, and that he was given two gold sleeve buttons by James II.
During this time, he felt the need to deny that he had converted to Roman Catholicism.
In December 1712, 
he petitioned Queen Anne to be allowed to return from France.
On return to England, Taylor took the side of the non-usager faction in the split of about 1717. Taylor was consecrated bishop at Grey’s Inn, 25 January 1721 by the nonjuroring non-usager bishops, Samuel Hawes, Nathaniel Spinckes and Henry Gandy, in the presence of the 
Earl of Winchilsea, Robert Cotton, Revd Thomas Bell and John Blackbourne. He consecrated Richard Welton as bishop. Then Taylor and Welton consecrated John Talbot but the consecration was not recognised by other nonjurors as Welton had been consecrated by Taylor alone.
Taylor died 26 December 1722 at his brother's house in South Littleton and interred at the church in South Littleton.
A 1722 portrait by John Verelst engraved by George Vertue was published in 1723.

Shrove Tuesday (short story)

"Shrove Tuesday" (, in literal translation, "A day before Lent") is an 1887 short story by Anton Chekhov.
Publication.
The story was first published by "Peterburgskaya Gazeta", in its No. 52, 23 February (old style) 1887 issue, in the Fleeting Notes (Летучие заметки) section, signed A. Chekhonte. In a revised version (with Pavel Vasilyevich's speeches considerably curtailed and another aunt added) Chekhov included it into Volume 2 of his Collected Works published by Adolf Marks in 1899 (pp. 177-182). 
Plot.
It is the last day before Great Lent, and the family is busy eating, knowing they'll have to spend the next seven weeks on lean diet. Pavel Vasilyevich is summoned by his wife Pelageya Ivanovna to help out his son Styopa, a high-school boy in the second class, who sits in the nursery, crying over the textbook, having trouble understanding division of fractions, apparently as a result of having eaten too much pancakes. Rather dazed himself after heavy lunch, the father makes a poor job of it and, having totally lost the plot, starts relating his own stories about his school. 
Pelageya Ivanovna calls them to the table for tea, where they join her in the company of two aunts (one of whom is mostly silent, another is deaf and dumb) and a midwife. The conversation centers around the superb quality of the jam. Pavel Vasilyevich makes an attempt to return to his school memoirs with the story about a big schoolboy called Mamakhin who terrorized his teachers. 
The samovar, the cups, and the tablecloth are cleared away, but the family do not leave the table, waiting now for the supper. The midwife starts hiccupping, while Pavel Vasilyevich and Styopa sit side by side examining a volume of the "Niva" magazine. The cook, Anna, comes into the dining-room, and asks for forgiveness everybody except the midwife to whom she considers it superfluous to bow down, since she is not one of the gentry. 
And then Styopa terrifies his mother with the declaration that he wants to sleep and is going to bed. The boy missing the final supper before Lent is unthinkable, so she rushes to the kitchen to hurry the cook up, and the table is getting laid again, for supper.

Nameless Star

Nameless Star () is a 1979 Soviet romantic comedy television film directed by Mikhail Kozakov and based on the play of the same name by Mihail Sebastian.This film suddenly garnered critical acclaim from the United States Media, when, established writer and philanthropist William Katz compared the film to the infamous Shakespeare creation of Romeo and Juliet. However, all of this was made possible by the mass showing of this cinematic masterpiece in Mrs Bennet's quaint 9th grade english class room. This earth shattering event henceforth thrust the film into the spotlight of american film culture. The showing was orchestrated by Katz himself, along with his associate, self appointed sexiest man alive, Hunter Montgomery Nesbitt. "Truly a life changing work" -anonymous famous newspaper. 
Plot.
Romania, 1930s. In a provincial town where everyone knows each other, an extraordinary event is taking place. At the railway station late in the evening, the diesel-electric train "Bucharest-Sinai" comes to an end, which usually always passes here without stopping. The express train is stopped by the conductor of the train to throw out a stowaway passenger named Mona, who travels to Bucharest. She is clad in a luxurious dress and hat, and does not have anything in her pockets, except chips for playing in the casino. By the will of fate at the same time at the station she meets the cosmography teacher of the local gymnasium Marin Miroiu.
Miroiu offers the stranger a lodging for the night at his bachelor's home, while he himself plans to spend the night with his friend, music teacher Udri. She agrees. However, having remained alone with him, Mona is looking for an excuse not to let Marin go. Mona learns the secret of Marin - he talks about a star which he discovered, which is not in any astronomical catalog. They are happy together this night ...
In the morning Mona again disrupts the inner world of Marin Miroiu by telling him her decision to stay with him forever.
Meanwhile, Mona is sought by her lover Grig who finds her at the forlorn teacher's house. Granting Grig for her brother, Mona expresses a desire to stay in this town. With arguments and cynical assertions, Grig convinces Mona that she has no place in the province, after which they leave this town forever.
And so Marin remains alone with the truth, which he comprehends in his astronomical observations: "No star deviates from its path."

'Encore' mandarin is a citrus cultivar.
This cultivar is a hybrid between two mandarins (King x Willowleaf), obtained by H.B.Frost, in California. It began to be commercialized from 1965.
It is cultivated in Japan, in greenhouses. In Portugal, its area has increased due to the high prices of the fruits, but at the moment it is stabilized or diminishing.
The tree has a characteristic aspect, given by the branches that form an acute angle with the central axis of the tree, without observing pending branches.
The fruit is of excellent internal quality, although its vitamin C content is relatively low when compared to an orange. Each fruit can contain 25 or more seeds. In some orchards, the number of seeds is reduced.
It has a great tendency to alternate bearing. In the year of high harvest presents low levels of potassium. The fruit can even kill the branches because it is a very strong (the strongest) sink.
Sometimes fruit present peel pitting, which is a problem for its commercialization, especially in markets where this fruit is not known. There are orchards where no pitting appear until harvest, or peel pitting is not notorious.
Another problem is the fruit splitting in autumn.

The Rugby Football League Women's Super League (known as the Betfred Women's Super League due to sponsorship) is the elite women's rugby league club competition in England. Originally competed between four teams in the 2017 season, the league has developed with the 2021 season being contested by 10 teams playing home and away against each other with subsequent play-offs and a grand final.
History.
2014–2016: Background.
The first women's competition that was set up was the Women's Rugby League Championship, set up in 2014. It was mostly made up of community clubs with only Hunslet, Featherstone Rovers and Rochdale Hornets being professional clubs with a women's team. The league had a very low profile and only ran for three years until the Women's Super League was formed in 2017.
2017–2019: Foundations.
To give the sport a bigger profile, the Super League name used by the men's game was adopted in 2017. The new league was still made up of community clubs but more professional clubs entered a women's team, notably Bradford Bulls took over the Bradford Thunderbirds team. The four founding clubs were Bradford Bulls, Castleford Tigers, Featherstone Rovers and Thatto Heath Crusaders.
The league expanded the following year with Leeds, York and Wigan joining while St. Helens took over from Thatto Heath Crusaders. The league was expanded again to eight clubs for 2019 with the addition of Wakefield Trinity Ladies.
2020–2021: Expansion.
The league continued to grow with Warrington Wolves and Huddersfield Giants joining from the Championship for the 2020 season. The structure was also slightly changed with the addition of the Shield Final for the bottom six clubs to play for.
Season structure.
Ten teams play each other once, home or away over nine rounds. At the end if the regular season the team finishing top is awarded the League Leaders Shield. The top 4 then playoff for a place in the Grand Final while the bottom six playoff for a place in the Shield Final.
Play-off structure.
At the end of the regular season the top four teams play off in two semi-finals (1st v 4th and 2nd v 3rd) with the winners of these matches qualifying for the Grand Final match. The winner of this match is the competition's winner.
Champions.
The Double.
In rugby league, the term 'the Double' is referring to the achievement of a club that wins the top division and Challenge Cup in the same season.
The Treble.
The "Treble" refers to the team who wins all three domestic honours on offer during the season; Grand Final, League Leaders' Shield and Challenge Cup. Only Thatto Heath Crusaders had achieved this feat by the end of 2019 winning all three trophies in 2016.
Awards.
League Leaders.
The League Leaders is awarded to the team finishing the regular season top of Super League.
Woman of Steel award.
The Woman of Steel is an annual award for the best player of the season in Super League. It was formed in 2018 to become a part of the Man of Steel Awards at the end of the men's Super League season.
Sponsorship.
In August 2019 a sponsorship deal with bookmakers Betfred was announced to start immediately and which will run until the end of the 2021 season (concurrent with Betfred's sponsorship of Super League).

During the course of the adventure, he uncovers many secrets and histories of the universe.
Reception.
Croatian website Gamer.hr praised its low system requirements, the story, music and the animations but stated the game was littered with bugs and the movement was badly implemented. It also criticized its ending as rushed, as if it skipped over a certain portion of its story.
The game received mixed reviews upon its international release. Ron Dulin, in his review for Gamespot gave it 6.2 out of 10, praising certain points in its story and gameplay, but criticized the lack of voiceovers, the dated graphics and the lackluster progression of its story. IGN gave a similar opinion, stating that, apart from a neat few locales, it falls short of games like "The Longest Journey" due to the relatively low production values. It, however, praised its soundtrack and gameplay as entertaining, giving the entire package 6.4 out of 10. PC Zone gave it 5.1 out of 10, mostly criticizing its outdatedness.
The game currently holds a score of 57/100 based on 14 reviews on Metacritic and 60/100 on Gamerankings based on 19 reviews.

Marilena Preda Sânc

Marilena Preda Sânc (born April 17, 1955 in Bucharest) is a Romanian visual artist, art educator (current position – professor at National University of Arts, Bucharest, and author of feminism and Public Art writings. She is known for being one of the most active feminist artists in the country. She uses a multidisciplinary approach by employing various media such as drawing, painting, mural art, book-objects, video, performance, photography, and installation, and her work has been shown in museums, galleries, conferences, symposium, and broadcast venues around the world.
Her career spanned across two eras in Romania: the social, cultural, and political restrictions of the Communist era and freedom of the post-revolution era that allowed her to expand her expression. Preda Sânc explored a variety of themes including feminism, gender identity, gender fusion, globalization, self-exploration, and the interaction between public and private spaces.
Education and Work.
Preda Sânc received her B.A. from the National University of Arts in Bucharest in 1980. She later received a Ph. D. in visual arts in 2002. Her early work in the 80s was confined by the censorship regulations of the Communist government, but emphasized the exploration of the relationships between body and space (e.g. "My Body is Space in Space, Time For Memory of All"), and the expression of self-analysis. She states 'I am concerned about the idea of the inner and outer landscape of the human body; about places for meditation thoughts and emotions, opening a path toward a deeper penetration of multiple layers of reality.' Even though she faced restrictions, her art was still considered very experimental for the time, as seen in projects such as her intervention photographs and photo collages. After the 1989 revolution, Preda Sânc expanded her work to include a critical analysis of social and political norms in the country. This was because of the increased freedom for expression in the Eastern European art world as well as increased access to information from the Western world. During this time she also diversified her technique to include globe objects, video performances, and multimedia installations. Influenced by the war in Yugoslavia in 1999, she explored issues of globalization and political and cultural conflict (e.g. "Remapping the World"). She also no longer was separated from the feminist movement and was one of the only Romanian artists that actually embraced this label.
Role in Feminism in Romania.
Feminism in Romania did not take hold as it did in Western countries. During the Communist era, men and women in theory held equal positions, but in reality domestic work was still done primarily by women. Policies regarding reproduction also placed constraints on women's control over their sexual and reproductive life. After the revolution, women still experiences hardships, facing more difficulties finding work than men and receiving less pay. Although information access has increased in the country and there is more freedom to protest gender inequality, there is often a lack of interest in doing so. "The weak representation of feminist art in Romania is based on inconsistencies in information, prejudices, and negative value judgments: the majority of art training's interest is focused on making art as a means of expression without applying any serious gendered analysis" (Olivia Nitis). Wanda Mihuleac is considered to be the only artist pre-1990 to have any feminist approach in her work. After the revolution there were still very few to engage in this type of dialogue, even to the point of refusing to discuss what it was like being a woman in Romania during the Communist time. This is partly due to the negative connotation feminism has in the country and the idea that it lacks relevance in contemporary society. Marilena Preda Sânc is one of the only artists who embraces this term and addresses issues of gender inequality in her work. She uses her art related to feminism as a "self-referential statement," often incorporating themes related to body (e.g. "Bodyscape, Handscape, Mindscape 1993"). Preda Sânc sees social and political criticism as very personal, incorporating internal identity with external issues. One exhibition that she participated in that was related specifically to feminism was "Perspectives" in 2008. The project, organized by Olivia Nitis (curator, art critic, and feminist writer), was intended to "explore the cultural and historical differences between countries with no connection or with a direct and more appropriate connection to the waves and changes feminism has produced." One of Preda Sânc's works exhibited in this show was the photography/video installation "Diva". In 2013, "Good Girls"."Memory, Desire, Power" international exhibition happened at the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Bucharest. The project had three sections: "Memory", "Desire" and "Power", and was accompanied by an international symposium. Marilena Preda Sânc was its initiator and one of the sixty women artists exhibiting there. The show was initiated by Preda Sânc out of her "desire to set up in Bucharest a larger exhibition of women artists, preferably of those who decided, like herself, to take a feminist position."

St. James Seminary Senior High School

St. James Seminary is a senior high school in Sunyani, the capital of the Bono region of Ghana, founded in 1978 by Most Rev. James Kwadwo Owusu, the late bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sunyani. It is not just a Senior High School, but also a Catholic Minor Seminary which offers a wide range of opportunities for both seminarians and non-Seminarians to make them not only aware of their potentials, but to fulfill them. The school emphasizes moral, spiritual and positive character formation in addition to striving to achieve academic excellence. St. James has been adjudged the best senior high school in Ghana over the past decade having featured consecutively in the list of top ten performing schools in the West African Examinations Council’s Senior School Certificate Exams (WASSCE) over the period. It topped the WASSCE in 2006, 2009 and 2011 and produced the overall best and third best candidates in West Africa in the 2016 exam.
Students of St. James are nicknamed ‘The Saints’ to tout their high moral uprightness and spirituality akin to the characteristics of saints. An alumnus of St. James Seminary Senior High School is known as “Ɔhotenii” ("pl." Ahotefoɔ), the Twi word for a saint.
History.
St. James Seminary Senior High School was established in 1978 by the late Bishop of Roman Catholic Diocese of Sunyani Most Rev. James Owusu. In spite of the initial resistance and discouragement from many quarters, St. James Seminary opened as a private school with the admission of 14 students in the first year under the supervision of Monsignor Robert Mensah Abrampah as its first rector. The subsequent rectors would encounter humongous academic and infrastructural challenges in its running to the extent of relying on a few teachers to handle multiple subjects. A story is told of the current Vicar-General of Roman Catholic Diocese of Sunyani; Monsignor Dr. George Kwame Kumi who alone taught physics, chemistry and biology for a number of years. The school also relied on part-time teachers from its current rivals Sunyani Secondary School to provide tuition to students of St. James in the early years.
Help would later come when a former headmaster of St. Peter's Boys Senior High School at Nkwatia-Kwahu, Rev. Fr. Joseph Glatzel (SVD) was transferred to Yamfo to work in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Sunyani. Rev. Fr. Glatzel single-handedly funded and supervised the construction of the school's major classroom blocks and its first ever staff bungalow. Some notable teachers who were of great help to the school in its teething years include; Charles Oko Agyeman, Reverend Father John McVoy (became 2nd rector), Rev. Sr. Gerald (Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit), the first female teacher, Monsignor John Oppong Baah, Reverend Brother Joe Tsiquaye (Congregation of Holy Cross), among others.
The school trained seminarians through Ghana's old educational system and participated in the West African Examinations Council's General Certificate of Education (GCE) Ordinary Level Exams. Students of St. James continuously produced impeccable results year-in-year-out. However, in 1994, mainly due to the call on the Bishop by the Catholic faithful in the Sunyani Diocese for the establishment of a boys’ school to cater for their sons’ secondary education, the Bishop agreed to open up the seminary to non-seminarians to study alongside seminarians to ensure they all benefit from the high academic and moral discipline in St. James Seminary. The objective was that the future priests, and future laity, Catholics and non-Catholics, would know each other and establish cordial working relationships within and outside the church in the future.
St. James Seminary Secondary School became a government assisted school in 1994. The administration of the school has since been reserved for the church. The co-operation between seminarians and non-seminarians has been remarkably positive.
St. James offers high school-level subjects in General Arts, Business Studies and General Science programmes
Houses.

• Debating Club
• Science Club
• ICT Club
• Business and Social Science Clubs

Spirituality and Guidance.
The school regards spiritual development as central in human resource development. In pursuance of this, religious associations such as the Legion of Mary, Young Catholic Students Movement and the Catholic Students Union exist to develop students spiritually. Their activities include Bible studies, Bible quizzes and spiritual retreats. These groups undertake social and benevolent activities and frequently engage in clean-up exercises in and outside the school.
Recollection sessions are organized for students to help them live exemplary Christian lives.
The Guidance and Counselling Unit of the school does career, academic, personal and social counselling.
Through counselling, students are able to cope with difficult school situations, as well as overcome emotional difficulties. Academic and career counselling not only help students to overcome problems in their studies, but also to identify their strengths and weaknesses.
Bi-Lateral Cooperation and Exchanges.
St. James has a well-established bilateral relationship with St Mary's College, Dublin. Reciprocal visits to strengthen this tie and co-operation between St. James and their Irish counterpart began in 2004.
Scores of Irish High School students, teachers and medical teams have visited St. James since 2004 to have first-hand information about Ghana's educational system, as well as acquaint themselves with our cultural values, and build new relationships with their Ghanaian counterparts.
A delegation of 14, comprising students and teachers of St. James were in Ireland in 2015 for the same purpose. In 2016, St. James hosted two separate Irish delegations comprising 86 students, teachers and a medical team.
The Irish delegation attends classes, have cultural shows and play games with students of St. James Seminary whenever they visit. Another batch of St. James students also paid a reciprocal familiarization tour of Ireland in 2017.
St. James also has a young relationship with the Holy Spirit Catholic School in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, United States. In 2017, students of the Holy Spirit school made a cash donation to St. James through the Brong-Ahafo Regional Minister when he and the Chief Executives of Sunyani and Techiman visited Tuscaloosa to strengthen sister-city relations that exist between these cities.
Rectors.
The school's current rector is Rev. Fr. Alex Ansu Ebow who assumed the reigns in 2003 when his predecessor Most Rev. Matthew Kwasi Gyamfi was made the Bishop of the Sunyani Catholic Diocese. Most Rev. Gyamfi served between 1999 and 2003 following the retirement of Rev. Fr. Joseph Asuah in 1999.

Akalajalada

Akāla-jalada (c. 8th-9th century) was a Sanskrit-language poet from the Tripuri Kalachuri kingdom of present-day Central India. He was the great-grandfather of the Gurjara-Pratihara court poet Rajashekhara.
Biography.
Akalajalada was the great-grandfather of the 10th century poet Rajashekhara, so he must have lived in the 8th century or 9th century. He came from the Yayavara Brahmana family of Maharashtra: Rajashekhara's "Bala-Ramayana" calls him "Maharashtra-chudamani" ("crest jewel of Maharashtra"). The prologue of the text names the poets Surananda and Tarala as other members of this family. These ancestors of Rajashekhara flourished at the court of the Kalachuris of Tripuri.
"Akalajalada" (literally "out-of-season cloud") was probably a sobriquet, not the poet's real name. The poet was also known by other names, including Dakshinatya and Dvanduka. A verse attributed to Akalajalada in "Sharngadhara-paddhati" is attributed to Dakshinatya ("Southern") in Vallabha-deva's "Subhashitavali". Vidyakara's "Subhashita-ratna-kosha" attributes the same verse to "Dvanduka".
According to a verse by Rajashekhara, quoted by the 12th century writer Jalhana, a dramatist named Kadambari-rama plagiarized from Akalajalada for a "nataka" (play), and gained reputation as an excellent poet.
Works.
Only one verse attributed to Akalajalada is now extant. Its English translation by A. K. Warder is as follows:
Alternative translation by M. C. Choubey, according to whom this is the description of a drought in the Tripuri Kalachuri kingdom:
A verse attributed to Rajashekhara in Jalhana's "Sukti-muktavali" suggests that Akalajalada had written many "muktakas" (detached stanzas). These were later compiled into a collection titled "Vachana-Chandrika", which was highly appreciated by 77 contemporary poets.

During the time Chile was under the military dictatorship, Toro stopped painting to pursue activist and performance art. The Chilean group, Colectivo de Acciones de Art (CADA) served as inspiration as Toro created more anti-dictatorial work. Shortly after her return to Chile in 2014, she produced the work "In Situ" at the Museo de la Memoria y los Derechos Humanos in Santiago. This work addressed the loss of the Mapuche culture in contemporary Chile.

Emmanuelle Moureaux

Emmanuelle Moureaux (born 1971) is a Tokyo based French architect and designer who is known for implementation of color throughout her designs. Emmanuelle fell in love with Shimura, an outskirt city of Tokyo, Japan, while doing research for her thesis and has lived there since 1996. She founded emmanuelle moureaux architecture + design in 2003. The concept driving all of her work is shikiri, which literally means "dividing and creating space through colors." Emmanuelle created this concept of using color as a three dimensional element that can create space rather than a finish applied to surfaces as an afterthought.
Emmanuelle has many works in architecture including the "Shugamo Shinkin Bank" Shimura Branch, but also designs art instillations, interiors, and products. Despite her work varying in category, scale, and stature, color is ever-present. "100 Colors" is an art instillation series that implements color in ways that fortify shikiri. Even though nearly all of the installations share a common concept, each one is unique and successful in its own. Emmanuelle hopes to create emotion through color and allow people to experience color through touch and feel as well. This will show that colors can not only make space, but also create a space with additional layers of human emotion.

Rhyl West

Rhyl West is the name of one of the electoral wards of the town of Rhyl, Denbighshire, Wales. It covers the northwest part of the town, including the town centre at one end and as far as Marine Lake and the Marina Quay on the western edge. Rhyl East ward lies to the east, Rhyl South West to the south and Conwy County Borough's Kinmel Bay ward to the west.
Description.
Rhyl West includes Rhyl town centre and the area of the town to the southwest. According to the 2011 UK Census the population of the ward was 4,386 (with 3,369 of voting age).
In 2008 Rhyl West was measured as the most deprived ward in Wales, according to the Welsh Index of Multiple Deprivation. According to a 2002 article in "The Guardian", "many guest houses on the west side of town where the posh people once lived have been converted into cheap bedsits, homes for locals and incomers united by poverty and sometimes drugs". In 2008 the town was earmarked for help with regeneration, from the Welsh Government. In October Rhyl West councillors Ian Armstrong and Joan Butterfield joined local MP, Chris Ruane, to paint out a notorious derelict shop sign which read "Rhyl's Biggest Receiver Of Stolen Goods". Men in the ward had the second lowest life expectancy at birth, 68.3 years, of any ward in England and Wales in 2016.
County council elections.
The ward elects two county councillors to Denbighshire County Council and, at the May 2017 election, the seats were won by Patricia Jones and Peter Prendegast for Welsh Labour. The ward has consistently elected Labour councillors since 1995.
Rhyl Town Council.
For elections to Rhyl Town Council the town is divided into nine community wards, with Rhyl West county ward being subdivided into two community wards, Foryd and Bodfor. Four of the twenty two town councillors are elected from the Foryd and Bodfor wards.

Cigar cutter watch fob

A cigar cutter watch fob is a pendant that is attached to the opposite side of a chain as a pocket watch. It is used as decoration and to cleanly cut the end of a cigar so it burns evenly.
Both men’s and women’s watches were commonly attached to decorative fobs. However, because women were discouraged from smoking in public, it was primarily men who wore the cigar cutter variety. The men's pocket watch was most ordinarily carried in a watch pocket (still seen today in some suit vests and most jeans). It was almost always attached to a chain to secure the pocket watch against falling or theft while still having it readily available. Fobs at the ends of these chains became prevalent for various reasons, one of which was to hold a cigar cutter for men to prepare their cigars for smoking. The cigar cutter trimmed the end of the cigar with a knife blade, scissors or slicer and/or poked a hole with a sharp needle-like piercer.
The watch fob version of the cigar cutter falls into similar categories as those of the larger handheld or countertop cigar cutters.
What separates cigar cutter watch fobs from any other cigar cutters are their size. First, a cigar cutter fob must fit on the end of chain or leather strap and second, it needs to have a ring or small hole to attach it to that chain or strap. The fob was ordinarily left to dangle on the outside of the vest or trouser pocket to be worn as a status symbol and/or to make it easier to grasp and retrieve the watch.
As pocket watches proliferated, cigar cutter watch fobs frequently became a status symbol. Elaborate workmanship with intricate carvings, precious gems, and a wide diversity of design categories gives them a miniaturized and mechanized beauty that outweighs their function. Many such fobs have a sense of whimsy and are considered fine art pieces, created to showcase their craftsman's imagination and ingenuity. They were made of range from fine metals like gold, silver and platinum, while more affordable versions were forged of baser metals like brass, copper and steel.
The use of pocket watches has all but disappeared but there is still a lively marketplace for discerning collectors of both watches and cigar cutter watch fobs.

The Knoll Conservation Park

 
The Knoll Conservation Park (formerly The Knoll National Park Reserve and The Knoll National Pleasure Resort) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the suburb of Crafers West in the Adelaide Hills state government region about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about west of the town centre in Stirling.
The conservation park consists of land in section 612 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Adelaide and which is bounded to the west by the Waverley Ridge Road.
The conservation park began by 1917 as a national pleasure resort. On 9 November 1967, it was proclaimed under the "National Parks Act 1966" as "The Knoll National Parks Reserve". On 27 April 1972, it was reconstituted as "The Knoll Conservation Park" upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:The Knoll Conservation Park lies 13km south-east of Adelaide and is the smallest conservation park on the South Australian mainland. The Knoll is a small crest, 566m above sea level with steep south and east-facing slopes and a relatively flat north-western area. The park is covered by "eucalyptus obliqua" open forest with an understorey dominated by native plants in the southern and eastern sections, while introduced shrubs such as "Ulex europaeus" (gorse) are common in the north and west. The northern and western edges of the park support a large number and variety of introduced plant species. Past efforts made to control "Ulex europaeus" have failed and this species still remains as one of the serious pest plants in the park. 
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was nominated for inclusion on the interim list of the now-defunct Register of the National Estate, but was withdrawn by the nominator because of its “small size”, “ drastically altered natural vegetation” and the “reserve used primarily for community recreation with little or no conservation significance.”

Anna Sew Hoy

Anna Sew Hoy (born 1976, Auckland, New Zealand) is a sculptor and visual artist based in Los Angeles.
Life and work.
Sew Hoy completed her BFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York City in 1998 and finished her MFA at Bard College in 2008. Known for her abstract sculptures made from fabric and clay (often associated with craft or handiwork), the artist is interested in different materials being able to create a sense of intimacy within sparse installation environments. She began working with clay in high school (in a figure-sculpting class). Particularly interested in working with clay, she often begins with solid blocks of it and then adds fabrics, such as jean material or velvet flocking, metal elements, wood, rubber, and mirrors to create pieces that are both industrial and organic. In addition to making sculptures, which she wants to integrate into domestic, everyday settings, Sew Hoy also performs in and around her work.
Since 2007, Sew Hoy has been a visiting lecturer at UCLA, UC Irvine, USC, and Otis College of Art and Design. She has also been a visiting artist/guest lecturer at CalArts, ArtCenter, Pacific Northwest College of Art, SOMA in Mexico City, San Francisco State University, and San Francisco Institute of Art, among others.

A Brand New Me (Aretha Franklin album)

A Brand New Me is a compilation album by American recording artist Aretha Franklin. It was released on November 10, 2017, by Rhino Records and Atlantic Records. The album features archival vocal recordings that Franklin recorded for Atlantic Records accompanied by new orchestral arrangements by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and newly recorded backing vocals, in addition to the original (archived) background vocal and instrumental accompaniments. Producer Nick Patrick said of the album: "There is a reason that Aretha Franklin is called the 'Queen of Soul.' There is nothing more exciting than that incredible voice taking you on an emotional roller coaster ride through her amazing repertoire of songs. To have the opportunity to work with that voice on this project has been the greatest honor and to hear a symphony orchestra wrapped around those performances is breathtaking." Franklin died in August 2018, nine months after the album's release.

Manal Al Dowayan

Manal Al Dowayan ( "Manāl aḍ-Ḍawayān"; born 1973) is a Saudi Arabian contemporary artist, best known for her installation piece "Suspended Together" from the Home Ground Exhibition at the Barjeel Art Foundation in 2011. She has shown work in a number of shows including the 2012 "Soft Power" show at Alan Art Center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the 2013 "Journey of Belonging", a solo show at Athr Gallery in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, the 2017 "100 Masterpieces of Modern and Contemporary Arab Art" in Paris, France, as well as having her work exhibited in the 2014 USA Biennial in Houston, the 2015 P.3: Prospect New Orleans USA Biennial "Notes For Now", and the Venice Biennale in the "Future of a Promise" Exhibition. Her work spans many mediums from photography to installation and focuses on a progressive examination and critique women's roles in Saudi society.
Early life.
Al Dowayan was born in 1973 in Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province. She attended university, graduating with a Masters in Systems Analysis and Design. She began her career working for an oil company before transitioning full-time to an artistic practice in 2010 which primarily examines personal and political issues related to women's rights in the context of ultra-conservative Saudi Arabian laws that include banning women from travelling, driving, or speaking a woman's name in public. Manal Al Dowayan currently resides in London, England where she is working on her Masters in Contemporary Art Practice in the Public Sphere at the Royal College of Art in London.
Photography.
Manal Al Dowayan's early work primarily utilized black and white photography, including images from her "I AM" collection, "Drive-By Shootings", and "Nostalgia Carries Us". The "I Am" collection from 2005 was inspired by a speech given by King Abdullah Al Saud when he took the Saudi throne in 2005 in which he emphasized the importance of women's participation in building and enriching Saudi society. The controversial statement was interpreted in many ways by critics both for and against women's rights. Al Dowayan, from the statement, was inspired to photograph the women she believed the king was referring to from engineers to mothers to scientists, her series promoted the visibility and importance of Saudi Arabian women. Photographs from the "Drive-By Shootings" collection (2011) demonstrate the difficulty female artists working in Saudi Arabia face as their public movements are heavily restricted by the government. As a female, Al-Dowayan could not legally drive, but had a male drive her as she took photographs from the passenger seat of the moving vehicle. The resulting blurred images emphasize that she cannot simply step out of the car in order to create her art, but is subject to maintaining gender-appropriate behavior as an aspect of her creative process.
Installation art.
In 2012 Al Dowayan's installation work was featured in the Edge of Arabia show "We Need to Talk" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The show highlighted the need for progressive reform in Saudi Arabia as perceived by the artists. At the time it was the largest and most radical exhibit of contemporary Saudi artists, all of whom ran the risk of political backlash for their dissident artistic expressions. Al Dowayan's work "Esmi My Name" featured larger than life wooden worry beads with the names of women painted on them, hung from wool rope woven by Bedouin women. Saudi Arabians believe to utter a woman's name in public is a shameful or embarrassing taboo, casting Saudi women into obscurity and removing their unique identity, which according to Al Dowayan "is deeply linked to several elements of an individual's personality and one's name is integral among these elements thus by making women's names public. Al Dowayan's work seeks to question and change women's roles and treatment in Saudi society.
Among Al-Dowayan's most well-known work is "Suspended Together" (2011), a series consisting of 200 white fiberglass doves suspended from the ceiling. Each dove, a traditional symbol of freedom, has reproduced on it a permission-to-travel document that all Saudi women must have in order to travel. The certificate must be issued and signed by their appointed male guardian, be it their father, brother, or husband. The certificates Al Dowayan chose to reproduce were sent to her from a variety of Saudi women. The certificates range from six months to sixty years old, documenting a history of women's restricted rights. Al Dowayan describes the piece: "In this installation of doves, I explore the concept of suspended movement. Many leading women from Saudi, wonderful scientists, educators, engineers, artists and leaders, have donated their papers to be included in this artwork. These women are breaking new ground and achieving for their society, but when it comes to travel they are still treated 'like a flock of suspended doves.'"
Al-Dowayan's work has been exhibited at the British Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) and in Qatar among others.

Free Iraqi Forces

The Free Iraqi Forces (FIF) were a militia made up of Iraqi expatriates, who served in the 2003 invasion of Iraq and its aftermath, under the control of Ahmed Chalabi's Iraqi National Congress government-in-exile. The specifically paramilitary branch of the program was also known as the Free Iraqi Fighting Forces (FIFF), while other elements served as interpreters or on civil affairs projects.
Composition.
The original intent of the American Office of the Secretary of Defense was to recruit and train 3,000 Iraqi expatriates in Taszar, Hungary in preparation for the war. Recruitment, however, fell well below the target number, and were of dubious military utility, ranging from ages 18 to 55.
Operations.
The program was seen as unsuccessful, with at one point some US$63 million spent to recruit and train 69 troops for the FIF, and the program was dissolved in April 2003. The FIFF never numbered more than 500 troops. The units were also seen as undisciplined and pro-Shia and anti-Sunni, and engaged in looting.

Lynx (bus company)

Lynx, the trading name of 'Coastal Red Ltd', is an independent bus company based in King's Lynn and operating services across west and north Norfolk and eastern Cambridgeshire.
History.
Coastal Red was founded by Stephen Challis and Andrew Warnes in 2013. The pair (along with Julian Patterson) had previously established Konectbus in 1999 before selling it to the Go-Ahead Group in March 2010. Having considered construction and engineering, the idea of a new bus operation formally began in spring 2014. Julian Patterson would come aboard later that year upon leaving Go-Ahead. 
Operations commenced for Lynx on 6 January 2015, with a school contract between Southery and Downham Market Academy. On 26 January 2015, their first public bus service began, operating hourly between King's Lynn to Hunstanton, seven days a week.
Lynx expanded its network of routes with the takeover three Council-subsidised bus services from Stagecoach in Norfolk in September 2017, followed by a further eight former Stagecoach routes from 29 April 2018, after Stagecoach closed their King's Lynn depot. Among the services taken on following Stagecoach's withdrawal from the area was the western half of the popular and well established "Coasthopper" service between King's Lynn and Cromer. Lynx took over operation of the King's Lynn to Wells-next-the-Sea section of this route, rebranded it as "Coastliner 36" and extended the service inland from Wells to Fakenham. A further three services were taken over from Stagecoach in September 2018.
During 2019, Lynx funded a 'comprehensive' refurbishment/renewing of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, King's Lynn bus shelters, and a next bus information screen was provided by Norfolk County Council.
A brand new, thoroughly redesigned website (powered by the 'BusHub Mobility Platform') launched in December 2019, including a live bus tracker, fare calculator and journey planner, with an iOS &amp; Android app following shortly afterwards in January 2020
Fleet.
Lynx commenced operations with a fleet of four single-decker Optare Tempos, including an experimental prototype purchased directly from Optare. It has standardised on the type and by April 2018 it was operating the largest fleet of Tempos in the United Kingdom with 26.
Since September 2016, Lynx has also operated double-deckers including Optare Spectra and Wright Pulsar Gemini bodied DAF DB250LFs and Leyland Olympians. Two new, bespoke Alexander Dennis Enviro400 MMCs arrived in spring 2021 for added capacity on the Coastliner route.
Lynx own a Leyland National, which is operated as a heritage bus in a semi-preserved state, painted in Lynx's standard red livery. Delivered new to Hants &amp; Dorset in November 1977, it has been used in passenger service several times to mark special occasions, as well as attending industry and promotional events and bus enthusiasts' rallies. As of winter 2019/20 it is stored out of service.
Buses are painted in Volkswagen 'Mars Red' - chosen to stand out against other bus operators in the area and as a nod to the 'Poppy Red' of National Bus Company days.

Potremmo ritornare

"Potremmo ritornare" is a pop song written by Italian pop singer Tiziano Ferro. It was released as the first single from his sixth album "Il mestiere della vita" (2016) and achieved success in Italy, where it was certified double platinum by the Federation of the Italian Music Industry.
A Spanish-language version of the song was also released. Titled "Podríamos Regresar", it served as the first single from "El Oficio de la Vida", the Spanish edition of Ferro's sixth studio album.
Background and release.
Considered by the artist as the heir to Alla mia età, it was composed by Ferro in collaboration with Michael Tenisci (songwriter, along with Tiziano, of the song "La vita in un anno", written for Alessandra Amoroso and contained in the album " Vivere a colori " of 2016) and it is dedicated to a woman that the singer and composer has no more at his side; for his writing, Tiziano was inspired by the text by " Non escludo il ritorno " of Franco Califano . About the song, Ferro said:
In a world that is used to high volume and has no more time to listen to anyone, I answered in a low voice. With a song that speaks of those who at some point need to draw conclusions. Look around. Everything takes shape at the beginning of a new chapter. Who goes and who "could come back"
The song was adapted in Spanish by Diego Galindo Martinez with the title " Podríamos regresar " and released as the first single in Spain on January 20, 2017 from the album " El Oficio de la Vida ".
Music video.
The Music video (in Italian and Spanish) was directed by Gaetano Morbioli and shot in California. The singer is filmed in black and white while walking on stretches of sand (Desert Becker and Desert Dunes) and while walking barefoot by the sea (Laguna Beach).
On October 28, 2016, the same day of the publication of the single, the relative "making of" of the piece was made available on the YouTube channel of the Vevo profile of the artist. On 20 January 2017, the videoclip of Podríamos regresar was published on YouTube.

Stuyvesant family

The Stuyvesant family is a family of American politicians and landowners in New York City. The family is of Dutch origin and is descended from Peter Stuyvesant (1610–1672), who was born in Peperga, Friesland, Netherlands and served as the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland.
Legacy.
Peter Stuyvesant, the son of a Calvinist minister, and his family were large landowners in the northeastern portion of New Amsterdam arising from his period as the last Dutch Director-General of New Netherland. Stuyvesant was known as:
"a man of strong individuality, great firmness and remarkable foresight, he so impressed himself upon the affairs that the story of his life from 1647 to 1664 is practically a history of the colony during that period."
Currently, the Stuyvesant name is associated with several places in Manhattan's East Side, near present-day Gramercy Park: the Stuyvesant Town housing complex; Stuyvesant Square, a park in the area; and the Stuyvesant Apartments on East 18th Street, and Stuyvesant Street.
His farm, called the "Bouwerij" – the seventeenth-century Dutch word for "farm" – was the source for the name of the Manhattan street and surrounding neighborhood named "The Bowery". The contemporary neighborhood of Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn includes Stuyvesant Heights and retains its name.

Ponerorchis secundiflora

Ponerorchis secundiflora (synonym "Neottianthe secundiflora") is a species of plant in the family Orchidaceae. It is native from the Himalayas to China.
Taxonomy.
The species was described by Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1890, under the name "Habenaria secundiflora". However, this name had already been used for a different species in 1881, so was illegitimate. The species was first legitimately named in 1898 by Friedrich Kraenzlin as "Peristylus secundiflorus". It was later transferred to "Gymnadenia" and then to "Neottianthe". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that species of "Neottianthe", "Amitostigma" and "Ponerorchis" were mixed together in a single clade, making none of the three genera monophyletic as then circumscribed. "Neottianthe" and "Amitostigma" were subsumed into "Ponerorchis", with this species becoming "Ponerorchis secundiflora".
Distribution.
"Ponerorchis secundiflora" is native to the Himalayas, including Tibet, Nepal and the Assam region. Its range extends to Myanmar and south-central China (west Sichuan and north-west Yunnan).

Canadian Professional Rodeo Association

The Canadian Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA) is the governing body of professional rodeo in Canada. Its championship event is the Canadian Finals Rodeo (CFR) held every November. The CPRA also tracks its champions in the List of Canadian Rodeo Champions and its hall of fame inductees in the List of Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame Inductees.
History.
The Canadian Professional Rodeo Organization was founded in 1944. It started when some cowboys joined up to create the Cowboys Insurance Association when each cowboy added $1 to create an insurance fund. Rodeo management matched that amount to increase the insurance fund. A year later, in 1945, they renamed the organization the Cowboys Protective Association (CPA). Under the Societies Act, they completed the necessary actions to become an association. This enabled the organization to serve its members in a more general way. They enlisted their first president, Ken Thomson of Black Diamond. They had 160 members in the beginning. Money for fees was high and returns on wins was not. In 1965 the society incorporated under the name, Canadian Rodeo Cowboys Association, which continued until 1980. At that time, the organization finally became known under today's current name, Canadian Professional Rodeo Association (CPRA). Now the organization has over 1,000 members.
Women competed in the inaugural events of the Calgary Stampede in 1912 and participated in various rodeos until 1919. But from 1923, they were barred from official rodeo competitions in Canada until 1958. Hoping to gain approval for barrel racing to be added to the events of the Stampede and other official rodeo events, women formed the Canadian Girls' Barrel Racing Association in 1957. Two of its founding members, Isabella Hamilton (later Miller) and Viola Thomas met with the Cowboys Protective Association and were successful in convincing the board to allow women to compete from 1958, but because of biases by management were given race times with the children and received low pay. Frances Church, 1972 Canadian barrel racing champion, noted that in the United States men and women had equal purses for like events, but Stampede manager Winston Bruce's response was that barrel racing was neither a rodeo event nor one that crowds wanted to see. Women were barred from membership in the Canadian Rodeo Cowboys Association until 1975, though the organization allowed women to purchase permits to participate in events. When the Stampede went to team competition in 1979, individual barrel racing was not sanctioned and did not occur again until 1982. In 1988, women were voted out of membership in the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association and the following year, barrel racing was again suspended at the Stampede. Though the event was brought back in 1990, it would take until 1995 for women to earn back the right to vote as members of the CPRA, have barrel racing recognized as a “major event”, and be eligible for equal pay on the Canadian professional rodeo circuit. 
As of 2013, the High River Agricultural Society is no longer affiliated with the CPRA. This means that the annual Guy Weadick Days Rodeo in June will now be associated with the CPRA through the Foothills Cowboy Association instead.
On July 17, 2016, the CPRA fired their general manager, Dan Eddy. Eddy had been the general manager since February 2015. There had been some issues raised, but the business advisory council's recommendation was to retain him. However, the directors decided to terminate him. Afterwards, the advisory members resigned. Then some of the directors stepped down to protest Eddy's termination.
In 2018, the CPRA named a new president to the association. On February 28, 2018, Terry Cooke became the new president, and he took on his new duties forthwith. Also, per the CPRA, he was elected by acclamation. On October 19, 2016, the CPRA and Edmonton Northlands announced a partnership. The effect is that the CFR will continue to take place at the Northlands Coliseum, its historic home of 43 years.
On May 16, 2018, the CPRA announced a new partnership with the Finning Canada. Finning Canada became the title sponsor of Canada Rodeo Canada, so they are now known as the Finning Canada Pro Rodeo Tour. Finning happens to be the largest dealer for Caterpillar Inc. On June 12, 2018, the CPRA announced an ongoing yearly partnership with FloSports. This agreement states that in future all of the events and finals of the Finning Canada Pro Rodeo Tour, the Grass Roots Final, and the CFR will be aired exclusively on FloRodeo.com.
In 2020, only two CPRA events took place in the entire calendar year. They were both Xtreme Bulls events in the winter. Before the season was to be set into full swing in the spring, the regional COVID-19 epidemic became a global pandemic in March. As a result, all events were postponed. After several months, it was ultimately decided that the 2020 CPRA season was to be cancelled, along with the CFR.
Organization.
Pro Rodeo Canada is home to the Canadian Professional Rodeo Association and is headquartered in Airdrie, Alberta. Pro Rodeo Canada sanctions professional rodeo in Canada. For example, Pro Rodeo Canada sanctioned 55 rodeos in 2016. The total payout was $5.3 million. The organization's primary concerns are legitimacy of the rodeo competition and welfare of the livestock. Pro Rodeo Canada also works with the American sanctioning organization, Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association. Obviously, rodeo participants are the highest in the forefront of any organization, but Pro Rodeo Canada also consists of all of the other usual rodeo personnel, such as stock contractors, judges, announcers, bull fighters, and others. Last years and all previous years the CFR was held at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta. This year the 45th Annual Canadian Finals Rodeo (CFR) will be held at the ENMAX Centrium, Westerner Park, in Red Deer, Alberta. The ability to secure this arena demonstrates that the rodeo still has a strong fan base and high growth rate. The CFR had to move when it was announced that the city of Edmonton was going to close the Northlands Coliseum down. Previously, the finals were held at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton, Alberta, for its entire 44-year history. After announcing a new venue for the year 2018, the Canadian Finals Rodeo takes place in Red Deer, Alberta, on October 30 through November 4. 
The CFR is the ultimate event of the tour. Throughout Canada, it is considered the top national championship of professional rodeo, and starting in 2018, it will be held annually in Red Deer, Alberta. The CFR's top award amount is one of the largest in Canadian rodeo, totaling $1.65 million. The top 12 competitors from the sanctioned events are selected for the CFR each year. The CFR runs for six days each season. FloRodeo will, beginning in 2018, capture top athletes competing in those six rounds of the 7 events. FloRodeo will also capture the 7 event champions, a high-point, and an all-around cowboy champion. “We’re excited about broadening our reach through our new partnership with FloSports,” said Canadian Professional Rodeo Association General Manager Jeff Robson. “The opportunity to live stream the Finning Canada Pro Tour rodeos and both our finals – the Grass Roots Final and the Canadian Finals Rodeo – will provide welcome exposure for our sport and expand access for our fans." Annually, the rodeo features one of the nation's largest prize purses—$1.65 million—and accepts the top 12 money-earners from the CPRA rodeo season. Over six days, FloRodeo will capture some of rodeo's top athletes competing through six rounds to determine each of the seven event winners, a high-point, and an all-around champion.
In 2017 and now in 2018, it was announced that the Canadian Champions will receive an exemption to the RFD-TV's The American Rodeo Semi-Finals.
There are many rodeo associations sanctioning rodeos in a particular city or area in Canada that operate under the precepts of the CPRA. One such rodeo association is the British Columbia Rodeo Association.

Jennie Alexander

Jennie Alexander (December 8, 1930 – July 12, 2018) was an American woodworker considered a pioneer in the woodworking world, "Instrumental in designing the now iconic two-slat post-and-rung shaving chair,". She also coined the term "greenwoodworking" as a single word in her book, "Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood." 
Background.
Jennie Alexander spent her early childhood in Baltimore, Maryland learning to play the piano and later became a Jazz musician. She was introduced to woodworking at the Baltimore polytechnic institute High School and would later go on to open up her own home shop in 1960.
Her mother grew up in Quincy, Massachusetts, and was part of the educational sloyd system. Because of this Jennie was always encouraged to explore woodworking and learning through doing. Her father was a lawyer, and Jennie also attended law school at the university of Maryland, becoming a divorce lawyer. She embraced greenwoodworking as an avocation. She both practiced greenwoodworking, and studied the history of greenwoodworking by examining furniture at museums, private collections, auction houses, etc.
Born as John David Alexander Jr., Alexander was a transwoman who transitioned in 2007, at the age of 77. Alexander's wife, Joyce, died in 1996. The couple had three daughters. Jennie Alexander has five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren; one of whom is John D. Alexander III.
Career.
In 1978, Alexander wrote, "Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood", which was the first woodworking book published by Taunton Press"." This book describes the process and tools required to construct a shaved two-slat post-and-rung chair without the use of a wood lathe. She became a member of the Early American Industries Association (EAIA) which was a crucial step in her exploration of woodworking and chair making as it gave her access to collections of joined furniture. She also demonstrated how to make the shaved two-slat post-and-rung chair at an event hosted by EAIA. She later taught classes at Drew Langsner's Country Workshops in North Carolina and mentored many students.
At Country Workshops she met Peter Follansbee, and after years of corresponding, would go on to co write a book with him called, "Make a Joint Stool from a Tree: An Introduction to 17th-Century Joinery." She spent her later years mentoring many in greenwoodworking techniques and joinery. Jennie died July 12, 2018.
Two-slat post-and-rung shaving chair.
Jennie Alexander had attributed the success of the post-and-rung shaving chair to her wife, who after Jennie was told she could not wood turn in front of a live audience, encouraged Jennie to make the same chair by shaving all the parts close to round without a lathe. Jennie said, “So the shaving, really, made the existence of the post-and-rung chair a reality in this country.”
From her book, "Make a Chair from a Tree: An Introduction to Working Green Wood":
This chair differs in part from the Windsor chair because it does not have a solid carved seat. In a Ladderback Chair, the seat is not structural. Where in a Windsor chair, the seat is structural - all the legs, back and arms terminate in the seat.

Emma Brooker

Emma Brooker is a fictional character from the British soap opera "Coronation Street", portrayed by Alexandra Mardell. She first appeared on-screen during the episode broadcast on 20 April 2018. Emma's storylines have included short-term relationships with David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni), surviving a roof collapse at the local factory and discovering that Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) is her biological father.
Storylines.
Emma applies for an apprentice position at Audrey's when Maria Connor (Samia Longchambon) struggles to handle her workload with owner Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) being in hospital and David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd) taking some time off work due to personal reasons. Her application is successful and she begins work that month, much to the displeasure of David - who is set to be training her after he returns to work the same month - as he finds her annoying. When Emma arrives late, having missed her tram as she was too busy preparing for her first day, she begins irritating David by accidentally dropping products on the floor, her lack of initiative to put the kettle on and her constant apologies for her mistakes, among other things. David cited that she was a "walking disaster zone" and told Maria that there was no way she would be staying. However, Maria was insistent that she needed extra help with the amount of time David and his gran were taking off and said that Emma was friendly and keen to work. Despite his initial dislike for Emma, David realised that she was the perfect opportunity to help him feel masculine again - after he was viciously raped by his supposed friend Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton) in March that year. David seduced Emma and, hoping to impress the boss in order to keep the job, she agreed to have sex with him and the pair began a relationship - with Emma leaving her shared flat and moving into 8 Coronation Street, much to Gail Rodwell's (Helen Worth) shock. Shona tells David to stop using Emma, as she is young and naive and shouldn't be brought into his dramas - but he refuses until the tragic suicide of Aidan Connor (Shayne Ward) in May. Realising the extent of his own mental health issues brought on by the rape and that he needs help before he goes the same way Aidan did - David broke off his relationship with Emma, confessing his love for Shona and admits that he'd been raped by Josh.
Emma gets over being dumped quickly, moving into 19a Rosamund Street with Billy Mayhew (Daniel Brocklebank) and Summer Spellman (Matilda Freeman) - as per Shona's advice and begins showing an interest in local builder Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni) who, unlike David, was of a similar age to her. Emma and Seb began to flirt, despite the fact that he was still in a relationship with Faye Windass (Ellie Leach) - who became jealous of his and Emma's attraction. In August 2018, Faye's step-mother, Sally Metcalfe (Sally Dynevor) clocked Seb's dissatisfaction when Faye revealed that she was returning to the area full time, having been living with her mother Anna (Debbie Rush) for the past few months and implored Seb to end things with her if she was not who he wanted to be with. Although Seb found himself unable to confide in Emma that he had HIV and the pair's relationship didn't progress. Eventually, Emma moved in to 2a Coronation Street with Maria, her son Liam Connor (Charlie Wrenshall) and Bethany Platt (Lucy Fallon) after deciding to leave Billy's flat after it got too cramped with the addition of Sean Tully (Antony Cotton). Later, Emma strikes up a friendship with Chesney Brown (Sam Aston) and agrees to go on a date with him in order for her to work out his flaws when it comes to relationships. Emma quickly falls for Chesney and they begin dating, but she is disheartened to realise that he is actually interested in Gemma Winter (Dolly-Rose Campbell) instead. Unwilling to stand between 'true love', Emma breaks things off with Chesney and implores him to make a go of things with Gemma. Emma becomes firm friends with Gemma, who is able to convince Johnny (Richard Hawley) and Jenny Connor (Sally Ann Matthews) to hire Emma at The Rovers Return - and the pair are caught up in the Underworld factory roof collapse together when Gary Windass (Mikey North) sabotages the roof, although both escaped unscathed - the collapse proved fatal for Rana Habeeb (Bhavna Limbachia).
Development.
Character creation and role.
Emma first appeared in Episode 9435 in April 2018. Mardell's casting was announced on 21 March 2018, where it was revealed that she would be introduced as the new apprentice at Audrey Roberts' (Sue Nicholls) salon. Duncan Lindsay of the "Metro" reported that Emma would be incompetent at her job, which makes her clash with David Platt (Jack P. Shepherd), who had recently been raped by Josh Tucker (Ryan Clayton). David Brown of the "Radio Times" described the character as "bubbly". In June 2018, Mardell was offered a six-month extension to her contract after proving popular with the producers as well as the viewers. Following her contract renewal, Mardell relocated from her home in London to Manchester - where the show is filmed. Before landing the job on Corrie, Mardell's only other television credit was for an episode of "Vera" in 2017, since appearing on the show she has become the co-artistic director at the JunkBox Theatre in Manchester.
Producer Kate Oates said that by having sex with Emma, David is "trying to find a way to hide in plain sight." She added that David would credit having sex with Emma as "one of his big mistakes", but feels that it is a method of proving his masculinity. On her introduction, Mardell told Brown ("Radio Times") that she found the experience "very surreal", but said that she "settled in quite quickly". As part of a new salon storyline, Mardell featured in scenes with Rula Lenska, who portrays rival hairdresser Claudia Colby. She enjoyed filming with Nicholls and Lenska and felt "spoilt" to share scenes with both actresses. Emma was also given a love interest in established character Seb Franklin (Harry Visinoni), who is diagnosed HIV-positive. Mardell thought that Emma would be "open-minded" about Seb's diagnosis, but would not understand it properly. She also believed that there would be problems with Seb's former girlfriend, Faye Windass (Ellie Leach), who was still romantically interested in him.
Parental developments.
Following Emma's first appearance on the show, many viewers began to pick up on the similarities between her and previous character Fiona Middleton (Angela Griffin) last seen in September 1998, as both characters looked alike, worked at the salon and lived at 2a Coronation Street. Although, during an interview with The Sun, Mardell explained "I've heard the Fiona and Steve's daughter theory, but that's definitely not true. I did have a little chat and a joke with Angela Griffin about it and that was quite funny". However, the storyline later went ahead and Emma was revealed to be Steve McDonald (Simon Gregson) and Fiona's daughter in August 2019. Despite the storyline going ahead, Fiona never returned to the street. Instead, she appeared to Emma from Australia via a video call in Episode 9854. However, Angela Griffin made a return to the street in real-life to film her scenes and spent time catching up with Nicholls and Mardell. After the parental developments were announced, some fans began theorising that a twist would see Emma turn out to be Jim McDonald (Charles Lawson)'s daughter instead of Steve's, due to his involvement with Fiona in the 90s. However, the show confirmed that Steve was her biological father, when he received the DNA results in Episode 9853. In an interview, Mardell stated that she believed Emma would eventually come to terms with the revelation and "Isn't one to hold a grudge".
Teasing her character's future, Mardell said: "No one will ever replace her dad, but her mum lives in Australia and she doesn't have any other family on the Street so it would be a waste to let that relationship go. She bonds with Liz McDonald (Beverley Callard) quite quickly, she's part of the McDonald family, they're taking her in. She's a McDonald now."
Reception.
For her portrayal of Emma, Mardell was nominated for Best Soap Newcomer at the 2018 "Digital Spy" Reader Awards. She placed fifth with 7.7% of the total votes. She was also longlisted in the Best Newcomer category at the 2018 "Inside Soap" Awards. Mardell was nominated in the Newcomer category at the National Television Awards in 2019, and won Best Newcomer at the 2019 British Soap Awards.

Career.
Saxton writes about 18th century literature and culture, early British women writers, and the history of the novel in English, focusing on intersections between literature, criminality and sexuality in relation to gender.
Recently, Saxton wrote the scholarly introduction to the British Library re-issue of the detective novel "The Incredible Crime" by Lois Austin-Leigh which had been out of print since 1931.
Saxton's "Narratives of Women and Murder in England" was cited as a "compelling and provocative study ... to be welcomed for the light it begins to shed on one of our enduring objects of cultural fascination." (Devereaux, 2010)
In 2000, Saxton co-edited with Rebecca P. Bocchicchio, a volume of essays on the work of Eliza Haywood which was hailed as marking a "pivotal moment in Haywood scholarship" (Merritt, 2001).

The Baptism of Christ (Donatello)

Baptism of Christ is a rectangular stiacciato marble relief of the Baptism of Christ, showing a crowd in the background, including a servant holding a towel to the left and an angel to the right. It measures 63.5 by 40.5 cm and dates to 1425, forming part of the decoration of the font in Arezzo Cathedral. Vasari's "Lives of the Artists" attributes it to a student from Donatello's studio, but art critics since the early 20th century have compared it with Donatello's autograph works and began more and more to include it among them, although not unanimously. The figure of Christ and the trees are strongly carved and definitely held to be by the master's hand, though St John the Baptist's legs and other areas are more schematic and may be the work of pupils.

Josephine Hale

Josephine Hale (May 27, 1878 – October 5, 1961) was an early Montana painter and nurse in the Red Cross during World War I. She spent much of her adult life in Great Falls, Montana, but traveled throughout France and the United States.
Personal life.
Josephine Hale was born in 1878 as Josephine Adeline Bruneau. The Bruneau family had eleven children, of which Hale was the youngest. Most of her siblings were born in Quebec however her family moved to the United States before Hale was born and settled near Sioux Point, South Dakota. In 1896 Hale graduated from a high school in Sioux City, Iowa. Two years later, at the age of twenty, Hale moved to Great Falls, MT where three of her siblings already lived. She began teaching in Eden, ten miles away from Great Falls, after passing her teacher certification test. The Montana Museum of Art and Culture states that it is likely she taught at "Canyon Schoolhouse, in the Eden area."
While in Great Falls, Josephine Hale met her husband, wealthy rancher Walter George Hale. The two married August 22, 1901 but the marriage lasted only three years. Walter Hale contracted and then died of tuberculosis. After her husband's death, Hale retained ownership of the ranch she had owned with him, and rented it to tenants as a source of income beginning in 1907. In 1910 Hale purchased a three-house lot in Great Falls which she used to board family members. She also created studio space in one of the attics.
In 1917 Hale joined the Red Cross as a nurse to serve during WWI. While living in France, Hale met George Hepburn Robertson and fell in love. George Hepburn Robertson served as the Director of Transportation for the American Red Cross, which is likely where they met. Although Hale never married Robertson it is likely that part of her reason for returning to France later in life was to continue the relationship. She remained in France until 1926 when she returned to the US and began attending school for interior decoration. Hale returned to France less than a year later to continue her art education.
In 1935 Hale moved back to Great Falls, MT where she lived during the Great Depression and WWII. During the ten years after her return from Europe she created a prolific amount of art work, she also continued nursing, a skill she had picked up in the Red Cross, for the rest of her life, including volunteering during WWII at Columbus Hospital.
Hale died in 1961 at the age of 83.
Red Cross.
World War I began in 1914, and in 1917 Josephine Hale enlisted in the Red Cross. At the time the Red Cross had an age limit on enlistment, and the forty year old Hale lied about her age, stating she was thirty-five, in order to enlist. Her ability to speak French was viewed as an asset and she paid for her own passage to Europe in order to ensure her acceptance.
Hale traveled from New York to London aboard a transport vessel named the Corinthia. For protection her ship was accompanied by a cruiser, U-boat destroyers, airplanes and hydroplanes. After she arrived in London, Hale took a train to Paris.
Hale's first assignment in France was in Paris at the Gara de l'Est canteen where she took medical classes and improved her language skills. After her training in Paris, Hale worked in canteens near the front, at Bordeaux. She would later open her own canteen in Marseilles. Hale wrote in her diary about her experiences working with soldiers:"because of my knowledge of French I am assigned on the French and Belgian side. They are so different from our boys and so very polite but they are accustomed to being waited on so it is a bit harder on the waiter. They seem very much pleased to have an American to talk and joke with them and how they love to air every bit of English that they know. The Americans are all about the same age, but the others range from 55 to 18 -- grey haired men and fresh faced boys and everyone ready to smile back at you every chance they get. It seems they take this war as their work and it is here to do."Hale also recorded her experiences through at the front photography including images of damage caused by bombs at Fort de la Pompelle, a cathedral in ruins and the destruction of a forest.
After Armistice, Hale extended her visa in order to continue working in devastated areas. In October 1920 she received her nursing degree from the Societe Francaise de Secours in Paris and in 1924 she was awarded the "Médaille de la Reconnaissance française" by the French government.
Art.
In early 1926 Hale moved to Boston and began attending courses at the New York School of Interior of Decoration. Her professors recommended that she pursue painting as a degree program. 
By October 14, 1926 Hale returned to Paris in order to continue studying interior design but the next year she began attending the Académie Delécluse, where she began her full-time study of painting and drawing. At the academy she studied under Auguste Joseph Delécluse, Eugene Delécluse, de Courmon and Jean-Paul Laurens. Later, she would describe her time studying art in France as "the happiest years of my life." Following nine years improving her skills, Hale received accolades in the Salon of 1934 and was invited to galleries and arts organizations.
Hale produced paintings with a wide variety of subjects including still lifes, florals, landscapes, portraits and nudes. Stylistically she was influenced by her experience with interior design in her use of fabric and floral patterns, French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, the Fauves use of animated lines in landscapes, and the European tradition of plein air painting. She also consistently referenced the book "The Art Spirit" by Robert Henri in her sketchbooks. Hale built her body of work by travelling extensively including visits to French Brittany, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Holland, Belgium, Morocco, the Sonoran Desert and Mexico.
In 1995 Vivian Ellis and Fran Walton gifted the Josephine Hale art collection to the Montana Museum of Art and Culture, which is the primary repository of her work. MMAC exhibit "Intimate West: Women Artists in Montana 1880-1944." The goal of the exhibit was to show a different interpretation of the American West than the traditional representations by artists like C.M. Russel and Edgar S. Paxson. Hale's works in the exhibit include studies and images of Glacier National Park that are described as "long, thoughtful studies of the natural world" by MMAC curator Jeremy Camwell.
Hale was also the subject of an exhibit, "The Life and Art of Josephine Hale, 1878-1961," at the Hockaday Museum of Art.

East and Central African Championships

The East and Central African Championships was an annual international athletics competition between nations in East and Central Africa.
The event was established as the East African Championships in 1955, building upon of international athletics matches between Kenya and Uganda (first held in 1934), which had themselves expanded to include Tanganyika in 1952. The competition remained between these countries (with Tanzania replacing Tanganyika after it merged with Zanzibar) until 1969, at which point Tanzania's southern neighbour Zambia was invited. Zambia became the first host outside of the founding three nations shortly after, with the 1971 championships being held in its capital Lusaka. More countries joined in the 1970s, including Ethiopia, Somalia, and this was expanded again in the 1980s (including Djibouti, Egypt, Zimbabwe, Mozambique). Somalia hosted the 1977 edition and the Egyptian capital Cairo was the venue in 1982 and 1985.
The championships had its final edition in 1990, with the absence of founding nation Kenya indicating the lack of support for its continuation. It had lasted for 32 editions from its inception, having been missed in the years 1962, 1966, 1978 and 1980.
Events.
By the latter years of the championships, a total of 35 athletics events had been regularly contested, 20 by men and 15 by women.
Events were contested over imperial distances up to 1968.
A men's marathon was contested between 1968 and 1981, with the first race being held separately from the main championships. Combined events featured at the 1972 edition, with Uganda's Alex Ochen taking the honours in the men's decathlon and his compatriot Budesia Nyakecho doing so in the women's pentathlon. Men's 20 kilometres race walks were held between 1975 and 1981, with Ethiopians Hunde Ture (1975, 1979) and Shemsu Hassan (1981) winning these events.
Women were present at the championships at least as early as 1967, with eleven women's events being contested that year. In 1970, a women's 1500 m and 4 × 400 m relay was added and the 80 metres hurdles was replaced by the international standard 100 m distance. A 3000 m for women was first held in 1976 and a women's 400 m hurdles in 1979. A women's 5000 m was first held in 1986 (won by Kenya's Susan Sirma), though it is not known if this was contested in any of the other later editions.

Stiacciato

Stiacciato is a technique which allows a sculptor to create a recessed or relief sculpture with carving only millimetres deep. To give the illusion of greater depth, the thickness gradually decreases from the foreground to the background. In some ways it is more similar to a 2D image than a 3D sculpture and so the relief can use perspective. Vasari writes of the technique:
The technique was mainly used in the 15th and 16th centuries, begun and dominated by Donatello. The earliest surviving example is his "St George Freeing the Princess" (1416-1417) and his other works in the genre include the "Pazzi Madonna" (1430), "The Assumption of the Virgin" (Sant'Angelo a Nilo, Naples, 1426-1428) and "Herod's Banquet" (Siena Baptistery, 1423-1427), along with "The Virgin and Child" (1426) by his studio.

Wilhelm Gisbert Groos

Wilhelm Gisbert Groos was a German World War I flying ace credited with seven aerial victories.
Early life.
Wilhelm Gisbert Groos (often written Gisbert Wilhelm) was born on 10 August 1894 to Dr. Ernst Gisbert Karl Julius Georg Groos and Laura Maria Colsman. He was admitted to the Prussian Cadet Corps and later served in an Uhlan Regiment. While an Ensign before the First World War, he had been training to compete in the 3,000 metre race at the 1916 Summer Olympics.
World War I service.
Groos received his pilot's licence from the Halberstadt Civil Flying School. He joined Jasta 4 in May 1917. On 17 May, he scored his first victory while flying over Droucourt, France against a British Sopwith triplane. Shortly afterwards, he was transferred to Jasta 11 on 24 May. He is credited with achieving five further victories between 24 June and 23 August. After Wilhelm Reinhard was wounded, Groos was briefly given command of Jasta 11 between 6-11 September. He relinquished command when Kurt Wolff returned from leave. Groos was wounded on 14 September and Wolff was killed the following day. After Wolff's death, Groos briefly reassumed command again between 15 and 25 September until Lothar von Richthofen was given the position.
After Groos recovered he was appointed a position within Jastaschule II in Nivelles. However, he returned to Jasta 11 on 10 July 1918 for a short time when there became a shortage of pilots. On 1 August 1918, he scored his last victory against a British SPAD aircraft. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Jastaschule II on 16 September and remained there for the rest of the war.
Post World War I.
Gross retired from the Luftstreitkräfte after the war. He married three times and had two sons, Manfred Wilhelm and Ernst Gisbert. He became the director of the Westdeutschen Steinzeug-Werke company in Euskirchen. In 1994, Groos celebrated his 100th birthday. He died in 1997 near Cologne/Bonn, around 103 years old. At the time of his death he was the last surviving member of Jasta 11.

Achalasimha

Achala-simha (IAST: Acala-siṃha) was a Sanskrit-language poet from India, who lived in the 12th century or earlier. His verses appear in several anthologies of Sanskrit poems.
Biography.
Achalasimha, sometimes called Achala (IAST: Acala), has been quoted in "Subhashita-ratna-kosha" of the 12th century anthologist scholar Vidyakara. Therefore, he must have lived in the 12th century or earlier. He may be same as the Buddhist author Achalasimha who wrote a tantric text, but this cannot be said with certainty.
Achalasimha appears to have been a well-known poet of his time. A verse in "Sharngadhara-paddhati" mentions him alongside other well-known poets, including Amara, Abhinanda and Kalidasa; and dismisses other poets as imitators. He is among the ten most frequently quoted poets in Vidyakara's "Subhashita-ratna-kosha".
Example verses.
One of Achalasimha's verses, about a pearl and addressed to a young woman, is included in Vidyakara's "Subhashita-ratna-kosha" and Bhoja's "Shringara-Prakasha". It goes like this (translated by A. K. Warder):
Another verse, about an angry woman, and attributed to Achalasimha by at least four anthologists (including Vidyakara, Shridhara-dasa, Jalhana and Sharangadhara), is as follows (translated by A. K. Warder):

Lillian Bertha Jones Horace ("née" Amstead; April 29, 1880 – August 1, 1965) was an African American author, educator, and librarian from Fort Worth, Texas, best known for her novels "Five Generations Hence" (1916), "Crowned with Glory and Honor", and "Angie Brown". These are the earliest novels on record written by an African-American woman from Texas. Horace married and divorced twice, and continued to teach, travel and write throughout her life. At the time of her retirement, she had been an educator for over thirty years.
Biography.
Early life and education.
Lillian Bertha Amstead (or Armistead) was born April 29, 1880 in Jefferson, Texas, to Thomas Amstead (or Armistead) and Macey Ackard Matthews; she also had one sister, Etta. The family moved to Fort Worth when Lillian was two years old. Thomas failed to support them financially, so the girls grew up helping their mother make ends meet. A self-described "dreamy" and "mystical" child, Lillian attended the East Ninth Street Colored School (renamed I.M. Terrell High School in 1921), the first free public school in Fort Worth, and Mt. Gilead Baptist Church. She attended several colleges and universities, including historically black colleges in the Jim Crow south. In 1898-99, Lillian attended Bishop College, a historically black college founded by the Baptist Home Mission Society in Marshall, Texas, which she credited with her commitment to the Baptist faith. Lillian attended the Dallas Summer Normal Institute, a segregated teacher education program, in 1905. In 1914, she enrolled at Prairie View State Normal and Industrial College (now Prairie View A&amp;M University) and graduated valedictorian in a class of seventy-four. Returning to Fort Worth to teach during the school year, Lillian attended summer courses at the University of Chicago in 1917, 1918, 1919, 1928, and 1940; at the University of Colorado Boulder in 1920; and at Columbia University in 1924. In 1920–1921, she attended Simmons College in Louisville, Kentucky, where she earned her bachelor's degree in 1922. While at Simmons College, she held the position of Dean of Women. Jones would later return to the University of Chicago in 1940 to study for a master's degree in Library Science.
Career.
After attending university, Horace moved back to the South and married David Jones, the son of her pastor Reverend Prince Jones. For the first few years of their marriage, they lived with his family in Denton. During this time, she studied for and passed her teaching exams, and took up her first teaching position in 1901 at a school in the rural community of Parvin in Denton County, Texas. The following year, she was named principal of the Handley Colored School, a one-room school in the Handley community east of Fort Worth. In 1911, Lillian returned to I.M. Terrell High School to teach English. During her long teaching career at I.M. Terrell, she established the school's journalism and drama departments, started a School Newspaper at I. M. Terrell called "Terrellife", and formed the school's first library using donations from parents. For many years, she served as the school's dean of girls.
Though teaching was her career, Lillian's greatest wish was "to write a book worth reading by an intelligent person, not necessarily [her] friend." In 1916, Lillian self-published her first book of utopian fiction, "Five Generations Hence", the first known novel by an African-American woman in Texas. The plot of the migration narrative, centering on fictional African-American educator Grace Noble, presents African-American women as heroines and the return of black Americans to Africa as a "plausible solution to the obstacles facing blacks in the South", five generations after their enslavement and transport to the Americas. The book was not widely distributed, but came to scholars' attention in 1995 when it was excerpted in "Daring to Dream: Utopian Stories by United States Women, 1836-1919".
In 1938, Lillian began writing a biography of Dr. Lacey Kirk Williams, the minister of Chicago's Olivet Baptist Church, then the largest church in the United States with a congregation of 12,000. He had been a minister at Lillian's own Mt. Gilead Baptist Church in Fort Worth prior to moving to Chicago. Williams was killed in a plane crash in 1940, and although Lillian finished the book the following year, power struggles within the National Baptist Convention prevented distribution of the book until 1964, when it gained the attention of Martin Luther King Jr. ""Crowned with Glory and Honor": The Life of Rev. Lacey Kirk Williams" was published posthumously in 1978.
Lillian's second novel, "Angie Brown", was written while traveling between Texas and California after her divorce from her second husband. Rather than presenting emigration to Africa as a solution to American racial struggles, "Angie Brown" focuses on the women's shared experience and envisions "cooperation between black and white women". "Angie Brown: A Jim Crow Romance" was published posthumously in 2017.
Personal life.
Lillian B. Horace was a member of the Texas Commission on Interracial Cooperation, Zeta Phi Beta sorority, Alphin Art &amp; Charity Club, Progressive Women's Club, Women's Council of Mt. Gilead, Heroines of Jericho, and Order of the Eastern Star; she also served as chaplain of the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs. She was also involved with the Texas Library Association and the National PTA. As a local civic leader and longtime educator at the "separate but superior" I.M. Terrell High School, Lillian was a significant influence on local African American women like educator Hazel Harvey Peace and civil rights activist Lulu B. White.
Both of Lillian's marriages ended in divorce, strained by her professional and personal ambitions. Lillian married David Jones, the son of her pastor at Mt. Gilead Baptist Church, in 1900; the couple divorced in 1919. She married Joseph Gentry Horace, a native of the small East Texas town of Groveton, in 1930. A recent widower seven years younger than Lillian, J. Gentry was an employee at Swift &amp; Co. in the Fort Worth Stockyards whom she probably met at church. With her support, he enrolled in the Bishop College seminary in 1935. The couple relocated to the Chicago area when he transferred to Northern Seminary five years later, earning his bachelor's degree in 1942 and master's degree in theology in 1943. J. Gentry became a minister at the Second Baptist Church of Evanston, Illinois; contrary to his congregation's expectations of a minister's wife, Lillian divided her time between Fort Worth and Evanston, continuing to teach at I.M. Terrell during the school year. After his mistress's husband exposed J. Gentry's longstanding affair with a local woman, Portia Cooke, he moved to another church and Lillian returned to Fort Worth after some time spent traveling in the west of the country. Their divorce was finalized in 1946. J. Gentry subsequently married Cooke in 1951.
Lillian had no children with Jones or Horace. She died of heart disease at a Fort Worth nursing home on August 6, 1965 and was buried at Old Trinity Cemetery, the African-American section of Fort Worth's historic Oakwood Cemetery. Her funeral was held on August 9, 1965. Those in attendance included members of the many organizations Horace was a part of, including the Zeta Phi Beta sorority, Heroines of Jericho, Progressive Woman's Club, Viola Court No. 250 and Alphin Charity and Literary Arts Club.
Literary works.
Literary legacy.
Lillian Bertha Jones Horace's literary works were lost for many decades until Karen Kossie-Chernyshev, a professor at Texas Southern University, located her diary and novels at Fort Worth Public Library. She was one of the only African American women writers working in the South during the 1940s. Scholars have argued that the category of Southern Literature has very few works by Black authors. Historians have viewed Horace's work as a way to widen this category. During the early to mid 1900s, the South upheld Jim Crow Laws. As an African American woman, Horace's freedom was limited under these laws which Dr. Veronica Watson argues influenced her work. In the diaries found by Kossie-Chernyshev, she wrote about everything from politics and war to her personal life. Her entries included some personal experiences with what she considered to be discrimination. For example, after a white woman stole shoes from her while she was at the store, and an employee refused to help her, Horace wrote:
The floorwalker, Mr. Weed, hurts my feelings. I lie awake and suffer much of the night. I want to say things to him not vulgar things but things to show how inconsiderate he was in a crisis. Shoes gone-- money and coupon "17"--but I suffer only for the insult I received. The first time I feel unpatriotic—just a dark face makes you the recipient of any insult. 
Themes of oppression and discrimination are present in her novels as well. Horace, similarly to Zora Neale Hurston and Langston Hughes, used her writing to expose and critique white supremacy. She is one of the few African American Women to do so during this time period. Horace's work adds to the knowledge scholars have of the ways in which Black female authors engaged with the concept of whiteness. Other influences on her work include Richard Wright's autobiography "Black Boy." She wrote many entries in her diary about it in which she complimented his writing style. However, she also critiqued his work for its portrayal of African Americans, which she thought to be too negative. Throughout her life, Horace wrote at least three novels. These include "Five Generations Hence, Crowned with Glory and Honor, and Angie Brown." Although Horace had a lengthy and successful teaching career, from a young age she desired to write. She did not achieve much recognition for her writing during her life, but after her novels were rediscovered, several essays were written which focus on her work. They were then compiled in the book "Recovering Five Generations Hence: The Life and Writing of Lillian Jones Horace", which includes her novel "Five Generations Hence".
"Five Generations Hence".
"Five Generations Hence", written in 1916, was Horace's first novel, which she self-published due to her work being rejected many times. She co-owned the publishing company that she used, Dotson Publishing Co. This novel was lost for many years until Carol Kessler included an excerpt of it in her novel "Daring to Dream", written in 1996. Horace's is the first known utopian novel written by an African American. Both of the protagonists of this novel, Grace Noble, a teacher, and Violet Gray, a missionary, are Black Women. Gray describes herself as the "advance guard of a mighty nation" while Noble is characterized as "truest and best type." By centering her story around Black Female characters, some of whom were intellectuals, Horace provided a picture of black womanhood that challenged stereotypes of black women, including the idea that they were promiscuous and foul-mouthed. Her premise puts forth emigrating to Africa as a solution to the discrimination faced by black people in the United States.
"Crowned with Glory and Honor".
"Crowned with Glory and Honor" (written in 1943) is a biography of Reverend Lacey Kirk Williams, a prominent pastor and president of the National Baptist Convention (NBC), 1922–1940. Reverend Williams died just as Horace was finishing this novel, which created tension between leaders of the NBC. At this time, Horace was unable to convince them to publish the Reverend's biography. However, many years later at a meeting of the Progressive National Baptists Convention Inc. (PBC) Horace shared her novel. In 1978, thirteen years after Horace's death, a leader of the PBC, L. Vencheal Booth, published her work.
"Angie Brown".
"Angie Brown", written in 1949, was Horace's third novel. She unsuccessfully attempted to have it published by New York-based publisher Lemuel L. Foster. This novel includes themes of interracial cooperation, focusing specifically on black and white women. The protagonist, Angie Brown, is an African American woman who experiences the death of her infant soon after her husband leaves her. One of the only interns who would see Black patients at a nearby segregated hospital did not return from an extended lunch in time to treat her child. A devastated Angie begins a journey that takes her far away from home where she finds support from both black and white women. In turn, she is a positive influence on those around her.

Saint George Freeing the Princess

Saint George Freeing the Princess is a marble stiacciato bas-relief sculpture by Donatello, sculpted around 1416 or 1417. It was originally situated under the same artist's "Saint George" on an external niche of the church of Orsanmichele in Florence; both works are now in the Bargello Museum, with replicas replacing them in their original positions.

Zankan Zorababeli

Zankan Zorababeli () was the 12th-century, Georgian Jewish merchant from Tbilisi.
The Queen Tamar's marriage was a question of state-importance. Every group strove to select and secure the acceptance of its candidate in order to strengthen its position and influence at court. Two factions fought for the influence in Tamar's court: clan of Mkhargrdzelis and Abulasan, "amirtamira" of Tbilisi. Then the Abulasan, came forward and said: "I know one prince, the son of the great Rus' prince Yury; he was a child when his father died, and, persuaded by his uncle Salavat, moved away to other country; He lives now in the city of Sevinj, king of the Kipchaks." candidature was approved by the council of feudal lords. They called an influential person in the kingdom, the great merchant Zankan Zorababeli. He was given the mission of bringing the bridegroom to Tbilisi. He fulfilled his mission with zeal, changing his horses on the way, he quickly reached his destination, and brought back the young man - valiant, perfect of body and pleasant to behold - sooner than the fixed time.

Xing Danwen

Xing Danwen (Chinese: 邢丹文; born 1967) is a contemporary Chinese artist and photographer. She is known for the images she made during and after her MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York, exploring ideas of dislocation as well as the form and psyche of contemporary living.
Biography.
Early life.
Xing Danwen was born in 1967 in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China. Her parents worked as engineers in a state-owned energy company.
Education.
The artist started her visual art practice with painting medium in her teens. From 1982–1986, she studied painting at the art school affiliated to Xi'an Academy of Fine Arts. From 1989–1992, she continued painting and earned her BFA in oil painting at the Central Academy of Fine Art.
In the late 1980s, she was drawn to photography. Self-taught in photography, she was one of a few artists in the late '80s and '90s in China exploring the boundaries of photography and using photography as an art form. Through the camera, she observed and challenged the questions on Chinese society, humanity, female identity and the generation born in the '60s. Xing documented the performance art movement among the East Village artists in Beijing in the early 1990s.
In 1998, she went to New York with a grant and fellowship from the Asian Cultural Council, New York. There, she did her MFA at the School of Visual Arts in New York with a chairman grant from SVA from 1998–2001.
This New York period challenged and enriched her artistic experience. In her current art practice she works, besides photography, also in the field of mixed media, video and multi-media installations.
Her artistic practice is both rich and varied and her subjects include: Dislocation between cultural status, conflicts between globalization and traditions, problematic environmental issues, the urban drama between the desire and reality. Fiction, truth and illusion often play an important role in her works.
Career.
One of Xing's first major works was the series "disConnexion" (2002–03), large-scale photographs of wires, circuit boards, and other computer waste exported from the United States to China's Guangdong Province.
Xing began her series "Urban Fiction" in 2004, which features photographs of architectural maquettes that Xing encountered at real-estate developers’ offices into which she inserted cutout figures that are enacting a scene of domestic drama. "Urban Fiction" has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, as part of the exhibition "Ink Art: Past as Present in Contemporary China", and at Harvard University's Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies.
In 2007, Xing continued her exploration of urban architecture and her relationship to the city of Beijing through the series "Wall House."
Major artworks.
A Personal Diary.
1993–2003, Photographs
In "A Personal Diary", Xing presents a highly poetic work that evinces her acute ability to inscribe China's alternative art scene in the 1990s into her own personal narrative.
We see the city through an eye disturbed by rapid urban development. It calls artists and their artworks from their studios to the streets, it witnesses the emergence of installation art in public spaces, and it accompanies and connects with performers in private apartments, evincing a strong, sensual closeness to them. The camera is frequently visible in the photographs, and so is the artist herself, as she captures people and events with an unmistakable passion for what is portrayed.
Born with Cultural Revolution.
1995, B/W Photographs. Featured in ANU/Verso 2019 publication "Afterlives of Chinese Communism" edited by Christian Sorace, Ivan Fraceschini, nad Nicholas Lumbere. 
I am a woman.
1994–1996, B/W Photographs
SCROLL.
1999–2000, B/W Photographs
"Scroll" is a series of panoramic photos of Beijing composed of many images that were shot in succession on 120 mm film. This method resulted in photos that are exceptionally long, narrow, and horizontal. The images were shot manually, without any computer manipulation or digitization. Danwen Xing relied on the film's original data, which she assembles into the final work.
"Scroll A" focuses on daily life and human activities in public spaces and "Scroll B" captures scenes of Beijing streets and buildings, resulting in haunting and poetic abstract images.
Sleep walking.
2001, two-channel video installation
In "Sleep Walking", Xing examines the effect of dislocation and how the mind can blur the distinctions between the past and the present, reality and fiction. The video weaves together images from different Western cityscapes accompanied by a soundtrack composed with Chinese traditional instruments and sounds of daily life in Chinese cities. The work implies a sense of loss and displacement, and evokes contending memories. Xing reconstructs reality, creating vigorous images infused with her visions of European Old Master paintings, the realities of these cities, and personal audial and visual memories.
disCONNEXION.
2002–2003, Color Photographs
Xing's concerns are not only related to large cities. She has traveled to southern China to explore the effects of electronic trash recycling on villages and small cities in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province. In "disCONNEXION", her critical eye and sharp lens examine the aesthetics of technological waste, reflecting environmental concerns, but more importantly, an anxiety about changes in the lives of workers along the south coast, whose ghosts can be sensed despite their absence from the frames.
Duplication.
2003, Color Photographs
"DUPLICATION" is a photography series staged in different toy factories across South China. Danwen Xing observed the entire toy production process and how designs are made for the international market to match the desires of people in every corner of the world. The toys are made to represent ideal beauty, but Xing deconstructs this by focusing her critical lens on the process and exploring the aesthetics of the identical parts.
Although the photos show only a fraction of the huge quantities of toy parts made in the factories, the work urges the eye to examine their differences and search for individuality.
Urban Fiction.
2004–present, photography with digital manipulation
In "Urban Fiction", the city becomes unreal, synthetic, and almost empty of its inhabitants. The artist inserts theatrical scenes into a series of photographs of promotional models used by real estate companies, with her as the main actor in playful, fictitious incidents. Hovering between reality and fantasy, the scenes compensate for the sense of emptiness in exponentially-expanding cities.
Wall House.
2007, Multimedia installation with photographs and video projection
In "Wall House", Xing stages herself inside a building designed by John Hejduk in the Netherlands, and her lonely presence draws its magic from the urban landscapes of Chinese cities seen from the windows of the space. Captivated by her passion for the city, she summons it, and questions the reality of the borders between public, private, and subjective spaces.
Because I am in the Mountains.
2017, Installation with coal-coke and mixed materials
This sculpture presents a panoramic miniature of a contemporary landscape made from coal coke, the synthetic material that results from burning coal. In this work, Danwen Xing creates a contrast between the polluting medium and the scene depicted. Confusion is triggered by the divergence between the apparent disaster that is contemporary life and the beautiful vision of a natural landscape from traditional Chinese ink art. Xing expresses clear concern for the threatened nature, but more importantly, she borrows a phrase from Chinese philosophy: standing on Mount Lu means that one cannot see its true face. She engages with a visible symbolic complex, recognizing that it is impossible to observe objectively when we are lost within ourselves.
Thread.
2017, Two-channel video with Sound, HD, 10 mins
In this new work, "Thread", Xing examines the complexity of communication and connection between people. The artist and her mother serve as the main characters. On one screen are the aged hands of the artist’s mother, insistently knitting a dress with love and care, and on the other, the daughter wears the dress as it unravels with her movement. A feeling of liberation is evoked as the daughter’s body slowly becomes exposed but also fragile, and vulnerable. The daughter is trapped in the thread, but she moves forward with an uncontrolled drive. Although the two actions are separate and seem contradictory, the viewer senses a complicity between mother and daughter, as if they share an unspoken, secret understanding.

Valerie Piraino

Valerie Piraino is a contemporary artist who works mainly in sculpture, drawing and instillation.
She was born in 1981 in Kigali, Rwanda and raised both in her home country as well as in the United States. Her art reflects her transnational identity and includes themes like defining the many aspects of identity as a whole, anti-colonialism (or anti-imperialism), African diaspora, and ancestral identity and memory. She has been the recipient of over a dozen awards and residencies, and has been featured in over thirty exhibitions in eight states and at least three countries.
Biography.
Valerie's mother, who was a Rwandan designer and seamstress, met her father, an American, while he was working in international relief efforts and development. After spending her early childhood in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and three other countries throughout Africa, Valerie, as well as her parents, moved to Arizona. Later, her family moved to Baltimore, MD, where she studied at the Maryland Institute College of Art. While studying in Baltimore, Valerie traveled back to Rwanda, where much of her mother's side of the family had been killed in the Rwandan Genocide. This trip inspired her work as a transnational artist, including her thesis project.
In 2005, Valerie moved to New York City, where she began her M.F.A. at Columbia University School of the Arts. She graduated with Her M.F.A in 2009 and along with creating her work, she currently works as a part-time faculty member at Parsons School of Design at the New School.
Notable works and exhibitions.
Arguably, her most notorious work is a series of sculptures consisting of papayas created by carving layers of polystyrene, and then covering the shapes in black epoxy clay, paint, resin, sawdust, and occasionally using gold paint to accent the work. The papayas are either displayed on flat surfaces or, as a later development, hung using nets created with twine. When discussing the significance behind the colors, black and gold, Valerie states that the black and gold are reminiscent of the mining and environmental damage that has taken place in Africa due to colonialism. The colors and textures are also said to represent the skin of the people from the region who were exploited for the natural resources of the country. Papayas were the fruit chosen to represent the artists transnational identity and anti-colonial attitude for two main reasons. First, papayas were a common breakfast for the artist when she was a young girl growing up in Africa. Secondly, papayas, native to the Caribbean, represent colonialism because they "follow the trajectory of imperialism and colonialism". Throughout the years and across multiple exhibitions, the meaning behind the work has shifted slightly. In an exhibit that ended in January, 2017 called "Dis Place" in the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, the papayas appeared to be broken and bruised, representing violence against African women.
While the papayas are some of Valerie's most notable works, she has created many other bodies of work and has been in exhibitions across the country, as well as being featured in exhibits in other countries around the world.
Awards and residencies.
Valerie has received many fellowships and awards throughout her years of creating art.

Åsen (municipality)

Åsen is a former municipality in the old Nord-Trøndelag county, Norway. The municipality existed from 1838 until its dissolution in 1962. The municipality was located to the southwest part of what is now Levanger municipality in Trøndelag county, roughly bordered in the north by the lakes Hammervatnet and Hoklingen, and by the Åsenfjorden to the west. The administrative centre was the village of Åsen.
History.
The municipality of "Aasen" was established on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). The spelling was later changed to "Åsen". During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the town of Levanger (population: 1,669) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Frol (population: 3,774), Åsen (population: 1,939), and Skogn (population: 4,756) to form a new, larger municipality called Levanger.
Government.
All municipalities in Norway, including Åsen, are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, unemployment and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of elected representatives, which in turn elects a mayor.

The municipality was located to the south and southwest of the town of Levanger in what is now Levanger municipality in Trøndelag county. The administrative centre was the village of Skogn.
History.
The prestegjeld of Skogn was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt). On 28 November 1874, a royal resolution moved two uninhabited parts of Skogn to the neighboring municipality of Levanger landsogn. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1962, the town of Levanger (population: 1,669) was merged with the neighboring municipalities of Frol (population: 3,774), Åsen (population: 1,939), and Skogn (population: 4,756) to form a new, larger municipality called Levanger.

Saint George (Donatello)

St George is a marble sculpture by Donatello. It is one of fourteen sculptures commissioned by the guilds of Florence to decorate the external niches of the Orsanmichele church. St. George was commissioned by the guild of the armorers and sword makers, the Arte dei Corazzai e Spadai. 
A stone thrown at the sculpture in 1858 broke its nose, and in 1892 Donatello's "St. George" was moved to the Bargello Museum in Florence. From 1892 to 2008 a bronze replica was placed in the original niche, to be replaced by a marble replica on 23 April 2008. The original sculpture was stolen from the Villa Medici in Poggio a Caiano, but in May 1945 it was recovered by Frederick Hart in Neumelans and returned to Italy on 20 July 1945. The box base was added back onto the statue in 1976.
Description.
Saint George is sculptured as a young, brave, determined and strong man in armor. He is standing in contrapposto, his right leg is turned to the same angle as his shield. Even though he is fully clothed, there is still the sense of a muscular body underneath. His right hand originally probably held some sort of a blade. Drill marks on his head indicate, that he probably also wore some kind of helmet or wreath.
St Georges eyes are looking up and his face indicates some kind of anxiety and emotionality before attacking the dragon (as in the biblical story). His eyebrows are knit together and there are wrinkles in his forehead.
Relief.
There is a stone relief under the figure, that is displaying woman observing St George slaying the dragon in the middle. There is a cave on the right, colonnade on the left and the relief also has a background with trees. The closets objects are carved in relatively high relief, whereas the cave, the colonnade and the background trees are carved in low relief. This technique is called Stiacciato.

Madonna of the Rose (Orsanmichele)

The Madonna of the Rose (Italian - "Madonna della Rosa") is a 2.2 metre high marble sculpture of the Madonna and Child enthroned, with the Child trying to take a bunch of rosa canina from his mother's hand. It forms part of a cycle of fourteen sculptures of the patron saints of the guilds of Florence on the external niches of the Orsanmichele church. No documents survive to precisely date it, leading to several theories and attributions. Most art historians attribute it to Pietro di Giovanni Tedesco, a German or Flemish sculptor active in Florence in the sculpture-yard of Florence Cathedral. It shows similarities to late works from the school of Giotto.
A Latin inscription on the base of the niche records damage to the sculpture in 1493 - Mary was the protector of Florence and the person who damaged the sculpture was sentenced to death. The Madonna was commissioned by the 'Arte dei Medici e Speziali' and completed around 1399. An object of great popular devotion, it was moved inside the church in 1628, meaning it is in a much better condition than the other thirteen sculptures in the cycle. It is now in the Museo di Orsanmichele, although a copy fills its original external niche, which had been used from 1858 until 1891 for "Saint George" by Donatello. It was restored in 1996, revealing it had possibly originally been painted.

Vehicle graveyard

A vehicle graveyard, cemetery, or boneyard is a location in which several vehicles, often of the same type, have been abandoned. The vehicles might be awaiting dismantling or recycling, or may just be left to decay. Most sites are intentionally created and many have security to protect them while others are forgotten and lay undiscovered for some time. These sites can be popular destinations for urban explorers.
Specific types of vehicle.
Aircraft.
An aircraft graveyard, or boneyard, is a location where numerous aircraft have been stored. The largest of which is the 309th Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Group, a near 2,600-acre site containing around 4,400 aircraft. There is an area in the southern Pacific Ocean, the oceanic pole of inaccessibility, in which over 260 spacecraft and satellites have been deposited after their working life, including the "Mir" space station.
Automobiles.
An automobile graveyard is a location in which cars or other road vehicles are kept until they have decayed or been destroyed. One particularly noteworthy example is near Victorville, California where hundreds of thousands of cars bought back by Volkswagen after the 2015 emissions scandal now reside.
Ships.
A ship graveyard is a location where the hulls of ships are left to decay and disintegrate. The largest ship graveyard is in the bay of Nouadhibou, Mauritania, where more than 300 vessels can be found.
Trains.
A train graveyard is where trains and rolling stock are left to decay. The "Cementerio de Trenes" (train cemetery) near Uyuni, Bolivia serves as a tourist attraction with trains dating back to the 19th century left to rust in the extensive salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni.

Pietro di Giovanni Tedesco

Piero di Giovanni Tedesco (died c. 1402) was a German or Flemish sculptor active in Italy. He was born before 1386.
Life.
According to Lorenzo Ghiberti, he owed his nickname 'Tedesco' to his origins in Germany or (according to others) in the Duchy of Brabant. He is first recorded in Florence in 1386 - there he worked on Florence Cathedral up until 1399 and a document dated 5 September 1387 from its records shows a payment to the painter Lorenzo di Bicci for designing a sculpture for Piero Tedesco to carve. He also worked on Milan Cathedral and in 1402 he is recorded as working on the font in Orvieto Cathedral.
The c.1399 "Madonna of the Rose" is attributed to him. Niccolò di Piero Lamberti was his assistant. His son Niccolò was a master glassmaker who worked on the windows at Orsanmichele among other places.

Berywam is a French beatbox crew based in Toulouse, France. They won the French Beatbox Championship 2016. Their EP was released on 2 June 2017. They also won the Beatbox Battle World Championship 2018 in crew category.
Career.
2015–2016: Formation crew and debut.
Berywam was formed in 2015 to the surprise of everyone during the French Beatbox Championship. The name of the band is composed with the first letters of each original member (BE-RY-WA-M). Despite being defeated by Team Punk in 2015, they won the French beatbox championship team category in 2016 and qualified for the 2018 World Beatbox Championship. Berywam became popular on the internet for their beatbox covers posted on various social media websites.
2017–2019: "Tú sí que vales", tour concert, line changes-up, "American Got Talent".
2017 was a turning point for the band as they began a tour across the France in April and finished with a summer tour until August. They released their EP on 2 June 2017, after signing a contract with Barclay Records. They opened for several well known artists' gigs like Bigflo &amp; Oli and Georgio. They ended their year strong, taking part in the Italian TV talent show Tú sí que vales. It was a success for the band, being eliminated only after reaching the finals.
They began 2018 by announcing two gigs: one in Paris in April and the other in Toulouse in February. Both concerts were sold out one month in advance. Stemming from their success that came from the two gigs, the band announced two more gigs in the same cities in September in Paris, and in October in Toulouse. They were also invited to one of the most famous French music festivals, Les Francofolies de La Rochelle.
2018 was a crucial year for the band as they prepared for their first album and the 5th Beatbox Battle World Championship.On 9 April 2018, Berywam published on their YouTube channel a video explaining that decided to leave the band to pursue his solo career. On 20 April 2018, the crew announced in another YouTube video that Beasty, winner of the 2010 French Beatbox Championship, was chosen as the new member of the crew. At the World Championships that year, Berywam (composed of the current members along with MB14), became world champions in the "Crew" category.
Berywam continued their talent show appearances by participating in the 14th season of America's Got Talent, broadcast on the NBC channel. Their first participation was broadcast on 18–19 June 2019. Following the latter, they manage to climb to the second round of show. Berywam successfully passed the second round but were unsuccessful in progressing to the semi-finals.
2020–present: Upcoming album and new projects.
At the start of 2020, the group announced they would be creating an album set for release in 2021. On 24 January 2020, Berywam released on YouTube and several streaming platforms "Beriddim", their first single song. On 24 July 2020, Berywam released the second single song "Pacifique" on streaming music platforms and YouTube.
In December 2020, Berywam released the first episode of a new concept called 'No Instrument'. This is a series where the group shed light on the creative process used for the formation of their upcoming album. The concept involves producing a complete track in the space of 3 hours, the genre of the track being chosen by ballot. So far they have launched 2 Reggaeton hits, 1 Brazilian trap and 1 Western trap. On 30 April 2021, the group released the single "Give It Up". Later, on 16 July 2021, the group released the single named "Beginning", remake from their trap routine. Composer's credit also goes to MB14, the one who made this melody famous.

Headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service

The Headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service or the BND Headquarters (, colloquially the "BND-Zentrale") is the headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) of Germany, and is located at the Chausseestraße in the Mitte district in the centre of Berlin. It is also known colloquially by the metonym Chausseestraße. Established during the early Cold War, the Federal Intelligence Service is the second largest intelligence agency in the Western world, second only to its close partner, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) of the United States. The building that houses its headquarters is the world's largest intelligence building, somewhat larger than the CIA headquarters at Langley.
History.
The complex is designed by the architect firm Kleihues + Kleihues. Construction started in 2006 and was completed in 2017. With 260,000 m² it is the world's largest intelligence headquarters, somewhat bigger than the CIA headquarters at Langley, and around 4,000 people work there. It is also Berlin's second largest building, after Berlin Tempelhof Airport. The first employees moved into the new complex in late 2017; the relocation from the former headquarters in Pullach was completed in the autumn of 2018.
The headquarters is located near the former trace of the Berlin Wall, on the eastern side, some 350 meters from the canal which marked the border to West Berlin during the Cold War, and directly adjacent to the former Chausseestraße crossing point. The headquarters are built on the site of the former stadium Stadion der Weltjugend. 
Following the decision to build the new BND headquarters there, a massive urban renewal has taken place in the neighbourhood, with many new construction projects opposite the BND headquarters, including high-end apartment buildings, a new park, the Café Top Secret, a new hotel, and buildings housing office spaces and retail stores.
The headquarters includes a visitor center that is open to the public; it is the first intelligence organisation to have such a center.
Although completed in 2017, the official opening was held in February 2019. Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany attended and made this statement: "In an often very confusing world, now, more urgently than ever, Germany needs a strong and efficient foreign intelligence service". At the time, some 4,000 employees were expected to work from this location, moving here from the former headquarters in a suburb of Munich. The agency's total number of employees, in Germany and other countries, was approximately 6,500.

Nair Lady Adorning Her Hair (Varma)

Nair lady Adorning Her Hair is an 1873 painting by Raja Ravi Varma. The painting depicts a domestic scene in which a Nair woman adorning her hair with a garland of flowers in front of a mirror. The painting was notable for being the first major award-winning work that Ravi Varma had completed. Receiving praise at the international and national level, the painting had brought the young Ravi Varma into the attention of the global artistic community, as well as leading him on to later become one of the most well known modern Indian painters.
Background.
Raja Ravi Varma was born on 1848 in Kerala, India. Ravi Varma was primarily known for incorporating Hindu themes and ideals with European styles. Varma was one of the first Indian artists to make use of oil painting and lithographic methods. Ravi Varma was first exposed to European methods of painting when he watched a Dutch painter when he arrived to do some paintings for the palace. 
Through trial and error, Ravi Varma had learned rudimentary techniques of oil painting. After deciding that painting would be a full-time profession, he had gone on to do some portraits and other small tasks for important local people. After returning to Trivandrum, Varma had been commissioned to do oil paintings for the Travancore Royal Court. After receiving an award for this task, he had gone on to paint "The Nair Lady Adorning Her Hair", which was to be his first point of recognition in the national and international level. 
Subject and themes.
Although Ravi Varma was trained in the European styles of painting——employing the techniques for illusionism and oil painting——Ravi Varma's style was primarily Malayali. The painting's subject includes a Nair lady adorning her hair in front of a mirror within a familiar household setting. Ravi Varma used techniques that used realism, but evoked styles from European artists such as Botticelli and Renoir. A common theme found in Ravi Varma's paintings are that of domesticity and female beauty, based on native values. 
Ravi Varma's paintings of Nair women in general were seen as part of a turning point in the discourse on female sexuality within the matrilineal context. It has been described that a notable feature about Ravi Varma's paintings of such women were the passive beauty and unerotic sensuality. Of even greater significance was the image of domesticity that Ravi Varma had presented.
Exhibition.
The painting was awarded the first prize, the prestigious Governor's Gold Medal, when it was presented at the Madras Fine Arts Society Exhibition of 1873, bringing Raja Ravi Varma into the limelight. He also received a Certificate of Merit at the International Exhibition held in Vienna for the painting.

Saint Peter (Brunelleschi)

Saint Peter is a Apuan marble sculpture of Saint Peter of 2.43 m high. It is attributed to Filippo Brunelleschi and his style is influenced by Donatello. It forms part of a cycle of fourteen statues of the patron saints of the guilds of Florence for the external niches of Orsanmichele. The sculpture of St Peter was completed for the Arte dei Beccai (butchers) guild around 1412 and is now in the Museo di Orsanmichele, although a replica fills its original niche.
History and attribution.
"Saint Peter" of Orsanmichele is one of the more-discussed statues of the complex, although the documentation for its provenance and dating are lost. The traditional attribution was to Donatello, as reported by Giorgio Vasari in his "Le Vite", where he wrote that the work as commissioned from Brunelleschi and Donatello but that only the second performed the work and brought it "to perfection." This attribution was placed in doubt by comparisons to the statues of Nanni di Banco, Michelozzo, and Bernardo Ciuffagni, which suggest a dating to the third decade of the 1400s. Contemporary critics are convinced by a Brunelleschi attribution for "Saint Peter" for the high quality of the work. Attributions to Ciuffagni don't make much sense, as he was a Gothic and Ghibertian sculptor even up to 1424–1427, when he executed sculptures of the prophet Isaiah and David, which don't compare to "Saint Peter" of Orsanmichele. 
Brunelleschi, after his defeat in the competition for the second door of the Florence Baptistery in 1401, went to Rome to study classical statuary. One indication that the perspective inlays were by Brunelleschi is that they are found in the tabernacle, which is not late Gothic but modeled after tabernacles of the mid-1400s. The inlays suggest an early phase of Brunelleschi's, leading up to the Renaissance. 
Saint Peter is dressed classically, like an ancient Roman statue, easily visible in Rome. His lean and tendinous wrists suggest the panel of the "Sacrifice of Isaac", which is a Gothic relief. If you compare the head of Saint Peter with the following figures of the silver altar of Saint Jacob at Pistoia, you can note an affinity in the prominence of his eyes, in the wrinkles on his forehead, and his nose. 
The statue was removed from the tabernacle in 1990 to be restored at the Opificio delle pietre dure up until 1992, with the contribution of the Accademia della fiorentina and the Associazione Macellai.
Description.
Saint Peter is depicted as a classical philosopher, with a beard and dressed in a toga and cloak. With his left arm, he holds a book, while in his right hand he carries his typical attribute of keys (in bronze, perhaps not original). The statue looks towards the left, toward the main street of via de' Calzaiuoli. 
The statue was carved in high-quality marble, not porous, that guaranteed its better conservation, compared to the rest of the series at Orsanmichele. The marble's hardness prevented it from absorbing the oils spread on marble statues at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century to make them look like bronzes. The statue is the only one in the series where no traces of gilding were found. It is thought to not had any at its making, while it was made with some metal elements, like the studs of Saint Peter's book.

1994 Italian Senate election in Lombardy

Lombardy renewed its delegation to the Italian Senate on March 27, 1994. This election was a part of national Italian general election of 1994 even if, according to the Italian Constitution, every senatorial challenge in each Region is a single and independent race.
The election was won by the new Silvio Berlusconi's centre-right coalition called Pole of Freedoms, which obtained a local landslide victory electing all its candidates.
Background.
This election was the first one of the so-called "Second Republic". If Italy had the strongest political stability in the previous 50 years, in twelve months it probably suffered the deepest democratic change ever in Western Europe. All the parties that ruled the country in the second half of the 20th century collapsed, under the political attack of the Northern League and the judiciary scandal of "Mani pulite". After the electoral reform from the proportional representation to a prevalent FPTP system, the political spectrum was reorganized in three "poles": the leftist Alliance of Progressives, the centrist Pact for Italy and the centre-rightist Pole of Freedoms. This latter was an alliance between the League and new liberal party Forza Italia of television entrepreneur and A.C. Milan President Silvio Berlusconi.
Berlusconi attacked the Progressives calling them a "communist" alliance, effectively subtracting quite all the former Socialist votes even if the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) was a member of that alliance: the PSI was consequently disbanded after 100 years of history, and the Alliance had little more than the traditional support of the former Italian Communist Party, then Democratic Party of the Left. Obtaining also more moderate votes than Christian Democracy's heir, the Italian People's Party (Pact), Berlusconi ensured the victory of his coalition, that in Lombardy resulted very profitable to the League, which obtained the absolute majority of the senators.
Electoral system.
The intricate electoral system introduced in 1993, called "Mattarella Law", provided 75% of the seats in the Senate as elected by first-past-the-post system, whereas the remaining 25% was assigned by a special proportional method that actually assigned the remaining seats to minority parties.
Redistricting.
The new electoral law imposed the revision of the outdated design of the constituencies of 1948. After quite a half century, the agricultural south had lost population to the industrial Milan metropolitan area. The Province of Cremona and the Province of Pavia lost a seat, while new constituencies were added in the western and northern Milanese hinterland. The number of constituencies rose from 31 to 35.

Nenad Milić

Nenad Milić (; born 22 June 1962) is a politician in Serbia. At one time a prominent figure in Zoran Đinđić's administration, Milić has served in the National Assembly of Serbia on an almost continuous basis since 2007 as a member of the Liberal Democratic Party.
Early life and career.
Milić was born in Belgrade, in what was then the People's Republic of Serbia in the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. He holds a Bachelor of Laws degree from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law and worked in the Serbian ministry of the interior before entering political life, at one time serving as an inspector. He was head of general administration and secretary of the Belgrade municipality of Rakovica from 1997 to 2001.
Democratic Opposition of Serbia and the Đinđić administration.
Milić was head of legal service at the central election staff of the Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) from 2000 to 2002 and served on the Republic of Serbia's electoral commission in the same period. He was an active member of Vojislav Koštunica's electoral staff in the 2000 Yugoslavian presidential election, in which Koštunica challenged incumbent president Slobodan Milošević. On the eve of the vote, Milić was quoted as saying, "We are working day and night to prepare against all the tricks the regime used in past elections." He later challenged the initial published results of the first round of voting, arguing that the Milošević regime had inflated the total number of votes in two areas of Kosovo to deny Koštunica an outright majority victory. Following popular protests, the election commission released a revised vote count showing that Koštunica had indeed won an outright victory in the first round.
Milić was later the primary legal representative of the DOS in a court dispute over voting irregularities in a small number of polling stations following the 2000 Serbian parliamentary election. He advised the international media in January 2001 that a new Serbian government would soon be formed, following the exhaustion of the Serbian Radical Party's legal challenges against the vote.
Milić served as chief of Serbian prime minister Zoran Đinđić's cabinet from 2001 to 2002, and from 2002 to 2004 he was the deputy minister of internal affairs. In the latter context, he took part in discussions with authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina to better target criminal activities in the two countries; during this time, he remarked that the possible arrest of Ratko Mladić, Radovan Karadžić, and others by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) would not destabilize the region. He also participated in the creation of a regional strategy against organized crime, signed in Montenegro in October 2003.
Milić denied claims by Radical Party leader Vojislav Šešelj that British Special Air Service forces had tried to kidnap him at the behest of the ICTY in early 2003.
Following the assassination of Zoran Đinđić in March 2003, Milić was appointed to a working group to monitor and oversee the conclusion of the resulting state of emergency.
Democratic Party, the 2003 election, and removal from office.
The Democratic Opposition of Serbia dissolved in December 2003. Milić received the 198th position (out of 250) on the Democratic Party's electoral list in the 2003 Serbian parliamentary election. The party won thirty-seven seats, and Milić was not chosen as part of its parliamentary delegation. (From 2000 to 2011, parliamentary mandates were awarded to sponsoring parties or coalitions rather than to individual candidates, and it was common practice for the mandates to be distributed out of numerical order. Milić could have received a mandate despite his low position on the list, although in the event he was not.)
The Democratic Party was not part of the new government of Serbia formed after the 2003 election. In March 2004, Milić was fired as deputy interior minister by the new minister, Dragan Jočić. Jočić later stated that Milić, rather than the previous minister, had been responsible for overseeing cases related to war crimes while in office. In June 2004, Milić was dismissed from Serbia and Montenegro's national council for cooperation with the ICTY.
Liberal Democratic Party.
The Democratic Party split in 2004, and a group of party rebels led by Čedomir Jovanović subsequently formed a new organization called the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Milić sided with Jovanović and was elected to the LDP's presidency at its founding convention in November 2005.
In 2006, Milić charged the Serbian government of failing to operate an effective witness protection program in relation to the Đinđić murder trial and stated that Serbian police were not interested in arresting six remaining fugitives from the Zemun Clan.
During the 2007 Serbian parliamentary election, Milić stated that there had been an assassination attempt against Čedomir Jovanović, in which "five or six connected fuses [were] found under the back seat in the [party leader's] car where Jovanović usually sits." The LDP expressed outage when the interior ministry rejected reports that an explosive device had been planted in the car.
Milić was included on an LDP-fronted list in this election and was chosen for his party's assembly delegation when the list won fifteen mandates. Following the election, he represented the LDP in discussions with Serbian president Boris Tadić on the Ahtisaari Plan on the status of Kosovo and Metohija. He later served on the assembly's security committee and strongly opposed suggestions that the Serbian military could intervene in Kosovo and Metohija in the event of the disputed province declaring its independence. "Our troops have no business in Kosovo. We have been there and we remember how we fared, in spite of exclamations that we beat NATO. We would 'win' again that way," he said, adding that, "calls for the army to defend the Kosovo Serbs could only harm Serbia now."
In 2007, Milić was asked if the Đinđić government had succumbed to political pressures not to extradite Radovan Karadžić to the ICTY. He rejected the charge, stating, "Do you really think that we would have handed over Milošević and not handed over Karadžić? For the Serbian political scene and the Serbian society, it was much more difficult and more important - and it required more political courage and, as we unfortunately saw subsequently, personal courage as well - to hand over Milošević than Karadžić, Mladić or any other indictee."
The LDP fielded its own electoral list in the 2008 parliamentary election. Milić received the seventeenth position on the list and was again selected for the party's assembly delegation when the list won thirteen mandates. He continued to serve on Serbia's security committee.
Serbia's electoral system was reformed in 2011, such that parliamentary mandates were awarded in numerical order to candidates on successful lists. The LDP contested the 2012 parliamentary election as part of the Preokret (U-Turn) coalition; Milić received the tenth position on its list and was re-elected when the list won nineteen mandates. He once again served on the security committee after the election.
Milić received the fourth position on a coalition list led by the LDP in the 2014 election; the list did not receive enough support to cross the electoral threshold, and Milić did not serve in the parliament that followed. He received the seventh position on a list that included the LDP and other parties in the 2016 election and returned to parliament when the list won thirteen mandates. He is currently a member of the parliamentary environmental protection committee and a deputy member of three other committees. For all of his parliamentary career, Milić has been an opposition member.

Saint Louis of Toulouse (Donatello)

Saint Louis of Toulouse is a 1423-1425 gilded bronze sculpture of Louis of Toulouse by Donatello, measuring 2.26 m high by 0.85 m wide. It is now in the refectory of the Museo di Santa Croce in Florence.
It is the artist's earliest surviving bronze sculpture and was commissioned by the Guelphs for their external niche at the centre of the via de' Calzaiuoli facade of the on Orsanmichele - the saint had given up his crown for the religious life, an idea also favoured by the Guelphs, who backed the papal party in the Investiture Controversy and later conflicts. The statue was completed in 1425, with Donatello also designing its niche according to Vasari, but in 1459 the niche was instead sold to the Tribunale della Mercanzia and used for their commission "Christ and St. Thomas".
Donatello was still alive and the statue was instead taken to Santa Croce, which St Louis had visited and where it was placed on a central niche in the facade. When the 19th-century facade was built the sculpture was put into store and then into the museum. In 1943 the Orsanmichele sculptures and others were place in secure storage for the duration of the war - "St Louis" was briefly placed in its original niche on the via de' Calzaiuoli facade of the Orsanmichele.

Frederick J. Taussig

Frederick J. Taussig (1872–1943) was an American gynecologist and professor of clinical obstetrics at Washington University School of Medicine. In the 1930s he was an influential advocate of legalization of abortion.
Life and work.
Frederick Taussig earned an A.B. at Harvard in 1893 and an M.D. at the Washington University School of Medicine (then called the St. Louis Medical College). He interned at the St. Louis City Hospital for Women and then at the Imperial and Royal Elizabeth Hospital in Vienna. In the early years of the 20th century, concerned about the large number of indigent cancer patients, he helped treat them and lobbied George D. Barnard to fund what became the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital. In 1909 he helped found a national association for social hygiene, and in 1910 he wrote the first medical monograph devoted entirely to abortion. In addition to the Barnard Free Skin and Cancer Hospital, Taussig saw patients at the Washington University Hospital, the St. Louis City Hospital, the St. Louis Maternity Hospital, the New Jewish Hospital, and the Barnes Hospital. Many of his research papers -- concerning such subjects as abortion and cancer of the vulva, cervix and vagina -- were based on observations at those hospitals. 
In 1933 Taussig joined with colleagues Robert Crossen, Frances Stewart, and Lesley Patton to organize the first birth control clinic in St. Louis. In 1943 the clinic was renamed the Planned Parenthood Clinic of Missouri. Taussig was also on the board of directors at the National Committee on Maternal Health and the National Committee for Maternal Welfare.
The medical researcher Edmund Cowdry said that Taussig's 1936 book "Abortion, Spontaneous and Induced: Medical and Social Aspects" is "a classic recognized by medical men and sociologists alike," and Mary Calderone of Planned Parenthood cited the book as a pioneering work. Robert Latou Dickinson wrote about the book that it "renders service that is fundamental."
Views on women and abortion.
Early in his career, Frederick Taussig was opposed to abortion. His 1910 book called widespread abortion "wholesale slaughter of the innocents." In the book he counseled his fellow physicians to be wary of women who exaggerate their difficulties in pregnancy in order to convince their doctors to give them a therapeutic abortion.
However, by 1936, when Taussig wrote his most famous treatise on abortion, his views had changed.
Authors who support legal access to safe abortions have credited Taussig with being an important voice for legalization in the 1930s, in part because, as an eminent physician who was not associated with the radical movements of the time, he had credibility among the more conservative sections of the public. Opponents of legalized abortion have concurred with this assessment; Marvin Olasky, the editor-in-chief of the Christian evangelical magazine "World", has called Taussig's "Abortion, Spontaneous and Induced" "the most effective pro-abortion book of the 1930s."
By the 1930s Taussig had also changed his attitude toward women. Rather than advising doctors to expect deviousness from women as he had done in the 1910 volume, he drew contrasts between the skill of midwives and the clumsiness of doctors whose sharp instruments often caused perforations of the uterus. He wrote that the increase in injury and death because of perforations over the previous fifty years was largely the result of "the proportionate increase in abortions handled by doctors as against those handled by midwives." Some passages in the 1936 book explicitly support greater rights for women:
Both Taussig's wife Florence Gottschalk and his daughter Mary Taussig Hall were active in women's rights and other progressive movements, in the latter case starting in 1916 at age 5, when she walked with her mother at the head of a demonstration by 7,000 women demanding the right to vote.

Knowledge Bennett

Knowledge Bennett is a Los Angeles–based visual artist known for his signature style that fuses pop art with contemporary and historical imagery. His provocative hybrid painting of Chairman Mao Zedong and Donald Trump was featured in the Chinese edition of "New York Times". Bennett's work has been illustrated and discussed in publications including "Vogue" and the "Huffington Post" and exhibited internationally at art fairs including Art Basel.
Early history.
Bennett is a self-taught artist from Asbury Park, New Jersey. In 2014, he relocated to Los Angeles. Motivated by an entrepreneurial spirit and interest in art history, Bennett started collecting fine art and taught himself various production processes, including photography and silk-screening.
Canvas art.
The subject of Bennett's art often surrounds appropriated photographs of famous creatives that he alters in different ways to emphasize social issues, like racism and identity politics, that plague American society. His production techniques, use of the same image in serial repetition, and even some of the images themselves, are inspired by Andy Warhol.
"Obama Cowboy," 2012.
In 2012, Bennett began working with appropriation techniques and quotations of Warhol in his series "Obama Cowboy". Here Bennett replaces the face of Elvis Presley in Warhol's "Elvis (Cowboy)", 1963 with the face of President Obama. This re-purposing introduces the conversation of race into the image and explores matters of gun culture, gun control and the meaning of the Second Amendment in contemporary society.
"Cojones", 2014.
For this series, Bennett appropriates the famous 1989 photograph taken by Janette Beckman of the rapper Slick Rick grabbing his groin, keeping the body and altering the meaning of the image by changing the face, Using historic and contemporary figures . In his new iteration of the image, Bennett emphasizes the defiance and courage of the icons he selects.
In 2016, Bennett exhibited several paintings from his "Cojones" series at Art Southampton on Long Island.
"Share a Coke (Coke Bottle)", 2015.
2015 marked the centennial of Coca-Cola's revolutionary bottle design. Bennett took this opportunity to celebrate not only the company but also Warhol's iconic image of the Coca-Cola bottle, updating the design to reflect its contemporary branding. Bennett first exhibited works from this series during SCOPE Art Show.
"Mao Trump", 2015.
To maximize his political statement, Bennett combined an image of Chairman Mao Zedong originally silk-screened by Andy Warhol in 1972 with an image of then-American businessman Donald Trump who later announced his intention to run for public office. For Bennett, this controversial image illustrates the perils of power as it pertains to both Eastern and Western political, cultural, and economic systems.
"Orange is the New Black", 2016.
In the series "Orange is the New Black", Bennett's most political to date, Bennett uses his signature silk-screening technique and serial formats to engage in a conversation surrounding institutional racism and continued disruption within the black community in America. Utilizing images of highly politicized figures and printing them in an orange color reminiscent of prison jumpsuits, Bennett identifies factual wrongdoing and abuse dating back to the 1930s.

Richard Emory

Richard Emory (born Emory Waldemar Johnson Jr., January 27, 1919 – February 15, 1994) was an American actor. He would achieve fame as an American B-movie actor of the 1950s and 1960s and would also play supporting roles in various television serials of the same period. He retired from movies and television in 1963.
Biography.
Early life.
Walter Emory Johnson Jr. was born in Santa Barbara, California. His mother was silent film actress Ella Hall and his father was actor-turned-director Emory Johnson. At the time of his birth, both parents were contract players for Universal.
By 1924, his parents' marriage was on the rocks, but they reconciled in late 1925. Tragedy struck in March 1926 when Emory's five-year-old brother, Alfred, was killed by a truck. The vehicle reportedly narrowly missed Emory. After the reconciliation of Emory's parents, the couple decided to have one last child. Emory's sister, Diana Marie, was born on October 27, 1929.
After his parents' divorced in 1930, Emory and his two younger sisters went to live with their mother. Emory would be the first of the Johnson children to appear in a film. At age ten, he had an uncredited role in the 1930 film All Quiet on the Western Front. He would have another uncredited part in the 1941 production of I Wanted Wings.
Military.
Emory registered for the draft on October 16, 1940, as Emory Waldemar Johnson. His military record indicates that he was 21 years of age, 6 feet tall, weighed 162 pounds, had blue eyes and blond hair and lived in North Hollywood. He enlisted in the Marine Corps on November 7, 1940 and served until he was discharged on September 12, 1945.
Career.
After World War II, Emory worked as a wholesale florist, but quit after 18 months and began studying at the Gilliard's Playhouse. He remained there for two years.
His first credited film role was in "South of Death Valley" which was released in 1949. "Bandit King of Texas" was released several days later. Around the time he left dramatic school, his rugged good looks got him employment as an advertising model. He used modeling to supplement his income for eighteen years because of the unsteady pay generated from movie parts.
Emory acted in a variety of movie genres that included adventure, comedy, science fiction, Westerns and musicals. A full third of his artistic output was in the Western genre. These films included "Code of the Silver Sage", "Gene Autry and the Mounties", "Little Big Horn", "Hellgate" and "Perils of the Wilderness."On television, a third of his output was westerns, including roles in "The Cisco Kid", "The Roy Rogers Show", "Bat Masterson", "The Gene Autry Show" and "The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin". He ended his acting career at the age of 44 with a role as an intern in the television series "Perry Mason". The episode aired on May 9, 1963.
Post career.
Emory spent many years living in North Hollywood, California. He was married there in January 1952. After he retired from movies and television, he sold insurance and real estate until, in 1966, he attended began work as a landscaper and gardener. He worked at his new job for ten years. In 1976, Emory retired again, at the age of 57d. In 1980, he and his wife moved to Jemez Springs, New Mexico where Emory was once again able to pursue his passion in life – growing things. Ten years later, Emory and his wife moved to Moab, Utah. The move may explain why Emory is listed in the "Brief Biographies of Latter Day Saint and/or Utah Film Personalities" website. The listing is based on being a Film Personality residing in Utah, not as being a member of the LDS church.
Death.
Emory died of a stroke on February 15, 1994, in Moab, Utah, at the age of 75. Unlike his parents and two siblings, he chose not to be interred with the rest of the family at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in California. Emory had a non-cemetery burial in Utah.

Skypark Link

Skypark Link is a limited express train service in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia between (KL Sentral) and Subang Airport. It is Malaysia's second airport rail link service, after the Express Rail Link (KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit).
Operated by Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM), the service shares the same tracks as the Port Klang Line between KL Sentral and Subang Jaya, however they diverge after Subang Jaya, with one set of tracks heading towards Subang Airport and the other towards Port Klang. Ordinary Port Klang Line trains stops at all stations between KL Sentral and Subang Jaya, while the Skypark Link runs non-stop between them. One new station, the Terminal Skypark station, located opposite Subang Airport, is built to serve the line. Two "reserve" stations were planned between Subang Jaya and Terminal Skypark, but are currently not constructed.
The line is one of the components of the Klang Valley Integrated Transit System. It is numbered and coloured Brown on official transit maps.

&lt;/mapframe&gt;
The 26km Skypark Link commenced operations on 1 May 2018 and runs between KL Sentral and Subang Skypark with a stop in Subang Jaya. In contrast to ordinary Port Klang Line services, after leaving Subang Jaya, the Skypark Link skips all stations between Setia Jaya and Abdullah Hukum, both stations inclusive.
The journey time from KL Sentral to Subang Skypark is 30 minutes. 
Operations began 1 May 2018 with free rides available until the end of the year. Free rides were only provided for trips that begin or end at Terminal Skypark; no free rides were given for trips between KL Sentral and Subang Jaya only.
Stations.
The three stations served by Skypark Link are, from east to west:
Frequency.
Currently, there are 16 trips from KL Sentral to Subang Skypark and also 16 return journeys from Subang Skypark to KL Sentral. The trains run on a frequency of between 60 minutes and 180 minutes. The timetable is as follows:
Rolling stock.
The service uses four refurbished KTM Class 83 electric multiple units (EMUs). The original livery, which featured blue and yellow colours associated with ordinary KTM Komuter services, were changed to grey and orange. The trains are expected to accommodate up to 300 passengers at once, and is intended to lighten traffic congestion and serve air passengers and people working at the Skypark terminal.
Background.
The Electrified Double Tracking Project consists of two phases: Phase 1 between Subang Jaya and Subang Skypark, which was awarded to "Konsortium Skypark Link-Lion Pacific Sdn Bhd", and phase 2 from Subang Skypark, through Kampung Melayu Subang and Ladang Elmina and ending at KTM/MRT Sg. Buloh to allow rail cargo traffic to bypass downtown Kuala Lumpur.. However, unconfirmed reports state that alternative plans, including an extension of the ECRL to Serendah instead of extending the Skypark Link, were being studied.
The construction of the link was funded by the Ministry of Transport to provide rail-based public transport to connect the Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah (SAAS) Airport Terminal 3 (Terminal Skypark) and its vicinity with the existing KTM railway. The RM521 million rail link was commissioned in 2013 with an initial completion date in 2016, but this was later extended to 2018.
The project consists of two main parts: an at-grade section between Subang Jaya and the old Sri Subang spur line for the length of 4.09 km using the existing railway reserve previously funded by Petronas to transport fuel from Port Klang to the airport, and a new section between the new location of Sri Subang for the total length of 4.067 km which is elevated rail track along the existing Sungai Damansara river reserve, ending at the car park just outside Subang Skypark.
Connection with KLIA.
Skypark Link interchanges with the Express Rail Link at KL Sentral, thus allowing rail connection between the Subang Airport and KLIA.

Saint Florus () (died 389) was the legendary first bishop of Lodève. He evangelised in Languedoc and the Auvergne, and was martyred in about 389.
His historicity is dubious. The first written references only appear in the 10th century, and the first "vita" was added to Bernard Gui's collection of the lives of saints "Speculum sanctorale" in the 14th century.
His tomb was the origin of a monastery, re-founded in the 11th century by Saint Odilo of Cluny, fifth abbot of Cluny. Around this abbey there grew the town of Saint-Flour, later the seat of the diocese of the same name, of which Florus is the patron saint.
His feast is kept either on 1 June or on 4 November.

Biography.
Jones is a native of The Dalles, Oregon, and the daughter of Aldo Harmon and Adelia Ellsworth. Jones was raised in Oregon and her parents were among the early builders of the LDS Church in the region. The church was not deeply established in the area and she was raised in a branch that was part of a district. The event which most influenced her gaining faith in the LDS Church was a talk given by Robert L. Backman, who was then the mission president in the region. 
Jones holds an associate of science degree from Brigham Young University (BYU) in family living. Jones worked as a dispatcher at the U.S. Forest Services dispatch center in Oregon. She also worked as an administrative assistant at the Federal Building in Provo and at a dermatology clinic. 
Jones married Robert B. Jones in the Manti Utah Temple in 1974. They met while studying at BYU and have five children. Jones has lived in Texas, Oregon, California, and Utah. For 14 years, she lived in Santa Rosa, California, and in 1994, she relocated to Draper, Utah.
LDS Church service.
For six years prior to her call as Primary general president, Jones served on the Primary General Board. She has also served as a ward Relief Society president and in presidencies of the Relief Society, Primary, and Young Women organizations, at both the ward and stake level.
In April 2016, Jones was called to succeed Rosemary M. Wixom as the Church’s Primary general president. She initially called Jean B. Bingham and Bonnie H. Cordon as counselors. When Bingham was called as Relief Society general president in 2017, with Cordon then called as Young Women general president in 2018, Jones concluded her service with Lisa L. Harkness as first counselor and Cristina B. Franco as second counselor. 
In 2018, Jones was the keynote speaker at the Utah Coalition Against Pornography Meeting. In 2019, Jones participated in the first-ever 'Sister-to-Sister' question-and-answer worldwide live event as part of BYU's Women's Conference. Jones was selected to participate in the 2019 White House National Day of Prayer and was quoted, "We pray for the leaders of this nation. Bless them, protect them and grant them wisdom." Jones gave a commencement address at BYU–Idaho in July 2019. In 2021, Jones presented a $300,000 gift from the LDS Church and its humanitarian arm to the Utah Children's Justice Center to assist their 26 centers throughout the state that serve children of sexual or physical abuse. In April 2021, she was succeeded as Primary general president by Camille N. Johnson.

Crime in Houston

Houston had 303 homicides in 2015 and 302 homicides in 2016. Officials predicted there would be 323 homicides in 2016. Instead, there was no increase in Houston's homicide rate between 2015 and 2016.
Houston's murder rate ranked 46th of U.S. cities with a population over 250,000 in 2005 (per capita rate of 16.3 murders per 100,000 population). In 2010, the city's murder rate (per capita rate of 11.8 murders per 100,000 population) was ranked sixth among U.S. cities with a population of over 750,000 (behind New York City, Chicago, Detroit, Dallas, and Philadelphia) according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
Murders fell by 37 percent from January to June 2011, compared with the same period in 2010. Houston's total crime rate including violent and nonviolent crimes decreased by 11 percent. The FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) indicates a downward trend of violent crime in Houston over the ten- and twenty-year periods ending in 2016, which is consistent with national trends. This trend toward lower rates of violent crime in Houston includes the murder rate, though it had seen a four-year uptick that lasted through 2015. Houston's violent crime rate was 8.6% percent higher in 2016 from the previous year. However, from 2006 to 2016, violent crime was still down 12 percent in Houston.
Houston is a significant hub for trafficking of cocaine, cannabis, heroin, MDMA, and methamphetamine due to its size. and proximity to major illegal-drug exporting nations. Houston is one of the country's largest hubs for human trafficking.
In the early 1970s, Houston, Pasadena and several coastal towns were the site of the Houston mass murders, which at the time were the deadliest case of serial killing in American history.
Gangs.
A spokesperson for the gang crime division of the Houston Police Department (HPD) stated in 2008 that white gangs in Houston include biker, prison, and racist groups, and that no predominately white Blood groups exist; there are some majority black gangs which had some white members. The "Houston Press" reported that year that there was a white street gang in Bacliff in Galveston County.
Criminal justice.
The county courts try criminal offenses under the law of Texas; City of Houston courts do not try criminal matters.
The Harris County, Texas jails in Downtown Houston house pre-trial and misdemeanor inmates under Texas law.
Federal Detention Center, Houston houses pre-trial and short-term inmates under federal law.
In 1853 the first execution in Houston took place in public at Founder's Cemetery in the Fourth Ward; initially the cemetery was the execution site, but post-1868 executions took place in the jail facilities. In 1923 the state took responsibility for all executions.

Joe Marelle

Joseph Marelle Sr. (born March 17, 1951) is an American former high school basketball coach and motivational speaker. He is one of the most successful high school basketball coaches in the U.S. state of Georgia. After surviving both non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute leukemia, Marelle started speaking publicly about his experience in Georgia and the national high school and college basketball communities.
Career and education.
Marelle was named head basketball coach at Duluth High School in 1981, where he coached for 19 seasons. He also was the school's athletic director from 1991 to 2001. During his tenure, his teams won four Georgia state sub-region championships, and in 1985 he led his team to the semifinals of the Georgia Class AA tournament. Marelle was named the Gwinnett County Coach of the Year in 1985, 1986, and 1995.
Marelle also worked as the head coach of Mount Pisgah Christian School from 2005 to 2007, a tenure that included a Class AAA state championship in his first year as head coach, and a 30-9 record over that span.
After working at Mount Pisgah, Marelle transitioned to an assistant coaching role at Greater Atlanta Christian School, where he coached from 2009 to 2014 and helped the school compile a 121-9 record during those years.
Marelle graduated from the University of North Florida with a degree in physical education and earned a master's degree from the University of Tennessee in 1975.
Cancer diagnosis.
Marelle was first diagnosed with cancer in 1998 after experiencing severe pain during a trip to San Antonio, Texas where he was a coach at the National Basketball Coaches Association's Final Four. He was diagnosed with a supposedly incurable form of stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma and given only six months to live. He underwent six years of chemotherapy treatments which eventually put his lymphoma into remission, but which also contributed to his second cancer diagnosis of acute leukemia.
Marelle was given a life-saving experimental bone marrow transplant from his oldest son and was able to return to coaching in 2005 as head coach at Mount Pisgah Christian School.
Motivational speaking &amp; philanthropy.
After his cancer's remission, Marelle was approached by Coaches vs. Cancer, a nationwide collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the National Association of Basketball Coaches, to give a speech about his life. He accepted the invitation and went on to host a Coaches vs. Cancer fundraiser, auctioning pieces of sports memorabilia. The auction raised more than $10,000 for the American Cancer Society.
Marelle's experiences were the subject of the book "Coaching To Defeat Cancer", which discusses the success stories of nine basketball coaches and cancer survivors.
Marelle's wife Kathy Marelle helped to plan "Brylee's Bash in the Park", a fundraiser for another Duluth family with a family member undergoing cancer treatment.
Marelle sent a letter to Larry Shyatt, then the head coach at Clemson University, in which he relayed his health situation and urged Shyatt and his players to keeping fighting hard in the midst of an eight-game losing streak during the 2000 to 2001 season. Shyatt read the letter to his team before their first game. A few days later, Clemson upset number-one ranked North Carolina for the second time in the school's history.
Awards and recognition.
Marelle was presented an autographed ball from the American Cancer Society for his involvement with Coaches vs. Cancer awareness.
Representative Brooks Coleman initiated a resolution in the Georgia State House of Representatives to commend Marelle for his outstanding coaching career and for inspiring others with his approach to battling cancer.
The Gwinnett Country Tip Off Club named an annual award after Marelle, calling it the Joe Marelle Courage Award. The award is presented to an outstanding player who has overcome health problems or other obstacles.
In 2003, a new gym at Duluth High School was dedicated and named in honor of Marelle.
The American Cancer Society's Coaches vs. Cancer named Marelle their "National Coach of the Year" in 2004, and Marelle spoke at the 2004 NCAA Final Four tournament to both coaches and players.
Marelle was named the 2005 to 2006 Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Coach of the Year.

1936 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1936 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 3, 1936, as part of the 1936 United States presidential election. State voters chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president.
Background.
Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic “Solid South” state. Disfranchisement of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites had meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections.
The 1920s did see a minor change in this, as increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson's internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote in 1920; however despite his national landslide Calvin Coolidge in 1924 could not do any more than win the two traditional Unionist GOP counties. 1928 saw the rest of the Outer South and North Alabama bolt the anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith, but the presence of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson as running mate meant that within Arkansas only the most northwesterly counties with ordinarily substantial Republican votes would suffer the same fate.
The following years saw Arkansas plunge into the Great Depression, followed almost immediately by a major drought from the summer of 1930s until the winter of 1931/1932. This came on top of a long depression in agriculture, which was still the dominant player in Arkansas’ economy and was backed up by the “Great Migration” of the state's agricultural labor force to northeastern and midwestern cities. Arkansas gave extremely heavy support to Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in 1932. Roosevelt won every county in the state, becoming the first Democrat to win Searcy County since before the Civil War and only the second to win adjacent Newton County.
Throughout his first term as President, Roosevelt was extremely popular in the “Solid South” and despite embryonic concerns over loss of southern control of the national party due to abolition of the “two-thirds” rule and some hostility to FDR's repeal of Prohibition he was overwhelmingly and in many places almost unanimously supported by Arkansas’ limited electorate. Ozark Republican Landon did regain the two Unionist and Prohibitionist Ozark counties, but topped 40% in only two of the remaining seventy-three.

List of political parties in France

France has a multi-party political system: one in which the number of competing political parties is sufficiently large as to make it almost inevitable that in order to participate in the exercise of power any single party must be prepared to negotiate with one or more others with a view to forming electoral alliances and/or coalition agreements.
The dominant French political parties are also characterised by a noticeable degree of intra-party factionalism, making each of them effectively a coalition in itself.
Up until recently, the government of France had alternated between two rather stable coalitions:places 
This was the case until the 2017 presidential election, when Emmanuel Macron of centrist La République En Marche! defeated Marine Le Pen of right-wing National Rally in the second round. This was the first time in which a third party had won the presidency, as well as the first time that neither of the major coalitions had appeared in the second round of a presidential election. This was followed shortly by a significant victory for LREM in the 2017 legislative election, winning a majority of 350 seats. Both the traditional coalitions suffered major defeats.
National Rally (previously known as the National Front before a name change in 2018) has also experienced significant successes in other elections. Since 2014, the party has established itself as the third sizable party, finishing in first place in the 2014 and 2019 European elections as well as in the 2015 local elections, though the party failed to win government in any regions due to the last-ditch alliance between the centre-left and the centre-right coalitions in Hauts-de-France and Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur.

Imperial Line

The Imperial Line (Italian "Linea dell'Impero" or "Linea Imperiale") was a flight route of the Italian national airline Ala Littoria between 1935 and 1941 during the Fascist era. It was the longest route in the Italian colonial empire in Africa and "the jewel in Ala Littoria's crown". It connected Rome with Benghazi (Libya), Asmara (Eritrea), Addis Abeba (Ethiopia) and Mogadishu (Somalia). It carried passengers and mail. Italy ultimately lost control of the route during World War II.
According to Federico Caprotti, "The celebration of colonial air links ... can be seen as playing into modern connotations of speed, progress, and reach, as well as aspirations to superiority. ... [T]he geographical imaginations evinced through the airline's documents and visual materials are deeply modern in their celebration of technological prowess and the domination of nature and space."
Development.
Ala Littoria's service to East Africa was inaugurated in 1935 under the name "Linea dell'Impero". On 7 July 1935 a memorandum of agreement was signed with Imperial Airways, a private British firm, whereby they would carry Ala Littoria passengers from Brindisi in southern Italy as far as Khartoum in the Sudan (via Cairo in Egypt). This was the first leg of Imperial Airways' route from Europe to South Africa. From Khartoum, Ala Littoria's passengers would transfer to its own aircraft and fly on to Kassala (Sudan), Asmara (Eritrea), Massawa (Eritrea), Djibouti (French Somaliland), Berbera (British Somaliland), Bura Galadi (British Kenya) and Mogadishu (Italian Somaliland). Full passenger service from Rome to Mogadishu opened in November 1935. By March 1937, service had been added to Gorrahei (Ethiopia) and Beledweyne (Somalia).
The Imperial Line was not a quick route. From Rome to Massawa took three days. Ala Littoria's chief executive, Umberto Klinger, claimed optimistically to "Il Messaggero" in 1936 that the route from Rome to Mogadishu took just three and a half days. Following the Italian conquest of Ethiopia, Addis Abeba was added to the route. The opening of the route from Rome to Addis Abeba via Cairo was delayed by the negotiations with the Egyptian government concerning flyover rights. The first two flights from Cairo to Addis Abeba even flew without permits. 
By October 1937, there were four weekly flights leaving Rome for Asmara and Addis Abeba, while Asmara had two weekly to Djibouti and another two weekly to Mogadishu (both via Assab and Dire Dawa). The timetable for the Imperial Line was less precise owing the longer flight times. Departures were usually scheduled for 10:15 a.m. at Rome, but arrivals were only given as dawn, morning or afternoon.
Airports and aircraft.
Airstrips in Italy's African colonies were mostly hot and high and the Imperial Line was more dangerous than European routes. The greater distance between airstrips in East Africa also contributed to a higher fatality rate on Imperial Line flights, with 40% of accidents resulting in deaths as opposed to 20% on European flights.
Besides land-based aircraft, the Imperial Line operated seaplanes for use on coastal routes and operating out of lakes and rivers. By 1938, the trip from Rome direct to Benghazi was accomplished by a Cant Z.506 seaplane, while the leg from Benghazi to Addis Abeba by a Savoia-Marchetti S.73. Both were trimotors. All the machines that flew the Imperial Line used foreign-built engines save for one S.73 that had an Alfa Pegaso and one Fokker F.VII trimotor that flew within East Africa and was equipped with an Alfa D.2.
Along the Imperial Line, there were maintenance bases at Rome, Brindisi, Benghazi and Asmara.
Passengers and revenues.
The Imperial Line's East African network had the highest revenues of any of Ala Littoria's route networks, about 44 million lire annually in 1936–37. It had the highest passenger revenues (9 million) and the highest mail revenues (35 million), and was the only network with higher mail revenue than passenger. This despite the fact that it carried fewer passengers than the other networks, only about 5,000 annually.

Praise (novel)

Praise is the first novel of Australian author Andrew McGahan which won The Australian/Vogel Literary Award in 1991 for unpublished manuscripts and the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book. Inspired by the writings of Charles Bukowski, the semi-autobiographical account of a doomed, drug and alcohol-fuelled relationship became an Australian bestseller, and is often credited with launching the short-lived "grunge lit" movement – terminology that McGahan himself (along with most of the writers to whom it was applied) rejected. 
Synopsis.
As the story begins, narrator Gordon Buchanan quits his job at a drive-through bottle shop in Brisbane. He and his live-in girlfriend Cynthia LaMonde, a waitress, inhabit a world of casual sex, plentiful drugs and partying till dawn, pastimes that don't really give Gordon much pleasure, plagued as he is by a sense of being unfulfilled. Love affairs gone bad and fantasies undercut by reality are the norm for a generation that stops doing something the moment it becomes work, that wants to win without competing because making an effort would render victory meaningless. 
The book’s hero is the chronically laidback Gordon, a chain-smoking asthmatic sweating under the Brisbane sun and scuttling his days away in a ramshackle guest house populated by itinerants and the elderly. Into Gordon’s going-nowhere-fast world comes the loud, vivacious and wholly uncompromising Cynthia, his polar opposite in almost every way. They soon move in together, and begin an often savage relationship precariously built on a shaky foundation of sex, booze, cigarettes, self-doubt and a singularly battered brand of love. 
Critical reception.
Praise became a cult bestseller in Australia in the years following its publication and the award of the Commonwealth Writers' Prize for Best First Book. On its U. S release the influential Kirkus Review wrote: ""Nothing life-affirming here--this prize-winning Australian first novel, straightforward and effective, immerses us in the drugs, sex, and general ennui of slackers Down Under. A bestseller in Australia, but without the superficial glamour of a Less Than Zero (to which its US publishers would like it compared). Unlikely to achieve the same success here, but, still, a bold novel, distinct voice, and impressive debut"."
Film adaptation.
In 1998, "Praise" was made into a film by first time producer Martha Coleman and fellow first-timer John Curran directed. Curran cast film novices Peter Fenton (frontman of rock group Crow) and Sacha Horler (a new National Institute of Dramatic Art graduate at the time) in the highly challenging lead roles of Gordon and Cynthia. The crew was a mix of newcomers and experienced old stagers. "Praise" received ten AFI Award nominations.

Alexandre Robinet de La Serve

Alexandre-Marie-Nicolas Robinet de La Serve (30 March 1821 – 4 February 1882) was a French sugar manufacturer, journalist and politician who was deputy and then senator of Réunion from 1870 to 1882 in the first years of the French Third Republic.

His father was a lawyer, politician and scholar who was born and died on the Île Bourbon (since 1848 called the Île de la Réunion).
His father moved to France after the British annexed the island in 1810, and married the daughter of Alexandre Chevassut().
Chevassut was a political agent and journalist who was the valet of Madame de Staël and founded the journal "Le Constitutionnel" under the Bourbon Restoration.
Chevassut employed Nicole Robinet de La Serve on the anti-royalist and Bonapartist daily "Le Constitutionnel".
Youth (1825–41).
Nicole Robinet de La Serve's returned to Reunion with his family in 1825 when he heard his mother was dying, and became leader of the clandestine "francs-créoles" political organization and founder of two unauthorized newspapers, "le Furet" and then "le Salazien".
Alexandre Robinet de Serve received his primary education in Réunion and completed his secondary education in Paris at the Lycée Henri-IV.
He began to study law, but returned to Réunion in 1840 before completing the course.
He contributed to the journal "L'Hebdomadaire".
On 16 January 1841 La Serve married Florine de Nas de Tourris (1822–1897) in Saint-Denis, Réunion.

After the fall of the Empire on 4 September 1870 the Government of National Defense issued a decree calling for the electors of France and the colonies to elect a National Assembly.
Later the election was postponed, but news of the postponement had not reached the island of Réunion when they held an election on 25 November 1870.
La Serve was elected Representative of Réunion by 12,804 votes out of 14,218.
This vote was declared valid for the future National Assembly, where La Serve sat with the Republican Union group, "Union républicaine".

Museo Parque de Bombas

Museo Parque de Bombas (Parque de Bombas Museum) is a museum located inside the historic Parque de Bombas in the Ponce Historic Zone in Ponce, Puerto Rico.
This museum is located at the Plaza Las Delicias town square, directly behind the Ponce Cathedral. It is housed in a building that once housed the city's main (and, initially, its only) firehouse. The building where the museum is located, has been heralded both for its historical and architectural roles in Puerto Rican society. Historically, it was Puerto Rico's first ever fire station. The building is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
As municipal firehouses in Puerto Rico were reorganized into a commonwealth-level agency in 1943, called the Firemen Services of Puerto Rico, a more modern spacious firehouse was built in the 1960s a block from Parque de Bombas. The new modern firehouse, now itself occupied by Instituto de Música Juan Morel Campos, displaced the now-historic Parque de Bombas into more of a supportive and administrative firefighting role, whereas the new firehouse, located at Calle Cristina and Calle Mayor streets, became the main firehouse for the town.
In 1990, after 108 years of uninterrupted service as a firehouse, the Parque de Bombas firehouse was turned into the Museo Parque de Bombas. The museum traces the people and events of the Ponce firefighters throughout its history. The museum opened under the administration of Mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago. The architect who rebuilt and reconditioned the structure into a museum in 1990 was Pablo Ojeda O'Neill. At over 100,000 visitors per year, it is Ponce's most visited museum, and Puerto Rico's second most visited landmark, after Castillo El Morro.
History.
The structure housing the museum was built in 1881, as the main exhibit pavilion for the 1882 Exhibition Trade Fair. A Spanish Army soldier, Lt. Colonel Maximo de Meana y Guridi who was also a trained architect, was commissioned in Puerto Rico at the time. The Madrid-based central government assigned Meana the task of designing and constructing the building. The building was unveiled during the 1882 Ponce Fair. The Fair's participants used the building as its main pavilion. The first brigade of firemen to work in the building were stationed there on 2 February 1883.
The station continued to serve the city of Ponce until 1990, ending its 108-year history as an active fire station. On that year, the station's fire-fighting duties were transferred to the more spacious fire station at Calle Cristina and Calle Mayor streets, and the building was officially converted into a fire-fighting museum. The restoration of the building into a museum took place under the guidance of Pablo Ojeda O'Neill, an experienced local museum curator. Restoration cost was $140,000 USD. Nowadays, a photo of the 1883 firefighters hangs on the walls of Museo Parque de Bombas. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the brigade's victory over the infamous fire was commemorated at the station. Various artifacts used by the 1882 fire brigade are on display at the museum. Among these are some artifacts used to combat the 1899 "El Polvorín" fire. There are also artifacts of historical significance. Even before its 1990 closure, the station had already become a major tourist attraction, and some of the firemen would give visitors free station tours voluntarily when they were not attending to emergencies. The Ponce firefighters' museum is still known generally as "Parque de Bombas" and, according to some estimates, it is one of Ponce's most visited tourist attractions.
Exhibitions.
The exhibitions in the museum are divided into three major halls. The Dispatch and Transportation Hall is located on the first floor, and the Equipment Hall and the Historical Records Hall are on the second floor.
Dispatch and transportation hall.
This hall consists of a small dispatch area showing the place with the firefighter officer where emergency calls were received and relayed to the firefighting personnel (their sleeping quarters were on the upstairs floor) as well as the equipment used in fighting fires in the 19th and first half of the 20th century. Located here are some of the pumps used to hand pump the water during a fire. Also here is an old firetruck dating from the first half of the 20th century. As a museum, the old dispatch area is now used as the museum's visitors' reception area.
Firefighting equipment hall.
This Hall is located on the southern side of the museum's second floor and, when the firehouse was operational, it was part of the firefighters' sleeping quarters. Located here are original axes, picks, bells, bugles and other such equipment as was used when the firehouse was fully operational in the nineteenth and first half to mid twentieth century. There are several firefighter uniforms, including their official Ponce Firefighters patch, as well as accompanying helmets and boots.
Historical records hall.
This hall is located on the northern side of the museum's second floor, and it covers what was also part of the former sleeping quarters of the Ponce firefighters. In this hall the museum displays memorabilia related to the Ponce firefighters and their organizational structure. Through framed pictures, it traces the history of Ponce firefighters and some its major fires. Prominently displayed are group and individual pictures of the members of the Ponce Firefighters Corps. In addition to groups portraits of the firefighters corps visitors can see portraits of figures such as Firefighters Band director Domingo Cruz ("Cocolía") and firefighters medical director physician Dr. Rafael Pujals.
In 1820, two great fires affected the city of Ponce. One destroyed great part of the center of the city; and the other gutted 80% of Ponce's port zone, paralyzing all commercial trade to the southern section of Puerto Rico. This exhibit includes response to two major fires those that took place in the city in 1820, and in March 1845.
Another large fire included in this exhibit is the one that occurred on 25 January 1899. This was a large fire (later dubbed "El Polvorin") which threatened the lives of Ponceños as well as the economy of Puerto Rico as a whole, given Ponce's "de facto" role as Puerto Rico's banking and agricultural capital. A painting in the Museo Parque de Bombas commemorates the heroic acts of seven courageous "bomberos" and one civilian who fought bravely against the voracious fire that threatened the region. Disobeying orders from the American troops that had recently taken control of Puerto Rico, the group was able to control the flames that had started inside the U.S. Army’s gunpowder reserves. For their courage, disaster was narrowly averted. For their success battling the fire, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. A few yards from Parque de Bombas, on Plaza Federico Degetau, sits an obelisk to their memory, and at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery) a mausoleum was erected in 1911 to their memory where all seven heroes were eventually interred. Later on, the Parque de Bombas building was painted in Ponce's traditional city colors, red and black. A series of homes built a few years later for the firefighters and their families on 25 de Enero Street were also painted in these colors also.
A sad event in the history of this museum is the disappearance of an important historical document during 1975 restoration of Parque de Bombas. The document was the original (and so far only known copy) of the Proclamation of the "Heroes de El Polvorin" made by the Puerto Rico Legislative Assembly in 1906. In the Proclamation, seven firefighters and one civilian were declared heroes by Puerto Rico's highest national legislative body.

An anime television series adaptation by Telecom Animation Film aired from April to June 2021.
Plot.
Naoto Hachioji is an introverted second-year student at Kazehaya High School who prefers to avoid social interactions and draws manga in his spare time. One day, in the school library, a first-year girl, Hayase Nagatoro, inadvertently discovers his manga, calls him "Senpai", and teases him to the point of making him cry. She frequents the Art Club room where he hangs out, and continues to bully him for his timid personality and "otaku" interests, sometimes in a sexually suggestive fashion, calling him lewd. As she continues to push him to become more assertive, Senpai develops a crush on Nagatoro in return, and gradually comes out of his shell and involves himself in her life.
Senpai encounters Nagatoro's friends – Gamo, Yosshii, and Sakura – who appear at first to be cruel and shallow high school girls who only seek to torment Senpai, but they catch on to Senpai and Nagatoro's oblivious mutual crush and they become supportive friends who scheme to bring the two closer together. The Art Club's semi-retired president appears and tries to shut down the club, but after a contest challenge during the culture festival, allows it to continue.

Saliena gens

The gens Saliena or Salliena, also written Salena, Sallena, Sallenia, and Sallienia, was a minor plebeian family at ancient Rome. Few members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The nomen "Salienus" belongs to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix "-enus", typically from other gentile names, or occasionally from places. The root of the name is not apparent, but it could be an orthographic variation of "Salvienus", from the Oscan praenomen "Salvius". Most of the Salieni known from inscriptions seem to have come from Umbria, Sabinum, Samnium, or Campania, suggesting that they were indeed of Oscan or Umbrian descent.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Salieni were "Titus" and "Quintus". Several other names received occasional use, including "Aulus", "Lucius", and "Publius". All were among the most common names throughout Roman history.
Branches and cognomina.
The Salieni used a variety of cognomina, most of which appear to have been personal surnames. The majority belong to common types of cognomen, derived from an individual's personal characteristics. "Clemens" refers to someone with a mild temperament, while "Fortunatus" is "fortunate", "Pudens" "modest", "Pulcher" "beautiful", "Sedatus" "calm". "Fuscianus" is a derivative of "Fuscus", "dark", while "Rufus" would originally have been given to someone with red hair. Other traditional Roman surnames used by members of this family include "Gallus", referring to a cockerel, or one of the Gauls, and "Musca", referring to a fly, or by extension, someone nosy.

Icelandic Order of Freemasons

The Icelandic Order of Freemasons () (abbr.: FaI), in English also known as the Grand Lodge of Iceland, is the governing body of regular Freemasonry in Iceland.
The history of Freemasonry in Iceland began when a "society of brothers“, Edda, was established in the Icelandic capital of Reykjavik in 1913. Edda became a lodge of instruction in 1918. The following year, on January 6, 1919, it became a fully warranted lodge. Since 1919, there have been a total of twelve warranted lodges and six lodges of instruction established in Iceland. Membership in the Order was at 3,379 as of March 15, 2011
Icelandic Freemasonry was under the jurisdiction of the Danish Order of Freemasons () until 1951 when the Grandlodge of Denmark constituted the Grand Lodge of Iceland as a sovereign Order.
Icelandic Freemasonry operates according to the Swedish Rite which is the dominant system in Scandinavia. Unlike other forms of Freemasonry, the Swedish Rite consists of eleven degrees, all of which are recognized by regular Freemasonry. As part of the Swedish Rite, the Icelandic Order of Freemasons requires its members to profess a belief in Christianity. The Order additionally requires its members to be over the age of twenty-one, to have a clean criminal record, and to have received the sponsorship of at least two members of the Order.
There are 17 lodges in Iceland.

R. S. Smith Motor Company Building

The R. S. Smith Motor Company Building is a historic building in Sandy, Oregon, United States, built in 1930. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
History.
The building was named for Robert S. Smith (18861966), a native of Clay Center, Kansas who settled in nearby Boring, Oregon, before relocating to Sandy between 1909 and 1911. In Sandy, Smith established the Sandy Blacksmith and Horseshoeing Shop, which he operated with his brother, Melvin. 
The R. S. Smith Motor Building was constructed after Smith shifted from blacksmithing and entered the automobile sales business, opening a Ford Motor Company agency in 1912. The building was fashioned as an auto sales showroom and garage with a combined service station. Designed in the Mission Revival architectural style, the building, constructed in 1930, is primarily made of concrete. At the time of the building's construction, Smith was the mayor of Sandy. In addition to Ford vehicles, Smith would later sell Studebaker models in the 1960s. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

Masters of the Elements

Masters of the Elements is an educational adventure video game developed by IJsfontein Interactive Media, and published by Bombilla (Dutch), Van In (Belgium), VNU Interactive, Tivola (English &amp; German), and Gallimard (French). The game was originally released in November, 1997 and ended up on Macintosh and Windows.
In the Anglosphere, it was published by Tivola, who had recently published other edutainment titles such as Physicus, Bioscopia, and Chemicus. Originally in Dutch, the game was later translated into English, German, Japanese, French and Italian. The game was voiced by Joost Prinsen and won a BAFTA Award in 1999 after its English-language release.
Production.
The game was created by Jan Willem Huisman, Hayo Wagenaar, and Sander Hassing. The three developers at IJsfontein knew each other from the InterAction Design department of the Utrecht School of the Arts, where they designed the concept of the game. Wagenaar made all of the drawings, Hassing served as programmer, and Huisman organised the operation. They came up with the name "IJsfontein" during the development of this game, which was their first project; while other development companies had English names they wanted to choose something Dutch-sounding. The game's sound designer came up with "Ice fountain" because ice is static while a fountain is dynamic.
While getting into large debt, the team was invited to the Cannes expo named Milia, where they set up a stall in a section for young talent. Interest from a Japanese publisher put them in a strong negotiating position with VNU Interactive; while it was standard for the publisher to get rights to the game, the developers refused. They felt the publisher was condescending from their comments that the world does not work the way they think it does.
Upon signing a contract with the Chinese, they discovered VNU still expected the company to lose the copyright due to not meeting a deadline. The team entered into a 'double or nothing' negotiation, whereby failing to complete the titled by 6 October, it would result in heavy royalty regulations. The team ultimately presented a beta version to children at an Amsterdam primary school, after suffering through a panic-stricken September. The game was playtested by children from the top three groups of primary school; the developers noted the potential for the game to be popular with girls due to them finding solutions in a process-wise way, as opposed to boys who will click the screen 10,000 times until something happens. By 2016, 40 people would work at IJsfontein.
Design.
It was one of the first serious games ever to be developed. At the time, IJsfontein was the first Dutch studio to explicitly develop a game with an educational bend. The game attempts to bridge two opposing sides of the video gaming market by offering an experience that is both fun and educational.
Plot and gameplay.
In the Castle of Infinity, there are five masters that bring balance to the elements. When Master of Chance loses his cat, the balance of the elements is disturbed. It is up to the player to collect pages of the Garden of Chance story, which will then cause Master of Chance to reveal clues about the whereabouts of his cat.
The game is puzzle based, with themes ranging from the natural world to physics to science.
Critical reception.
Gameboomers felt the puzzles required more dexterity than thought. Feibel felt the game was difficult and beautifully illustrated. The essay "Op de koffie bij de Meester van Wanhoop " thought the game demonstrated the wondrous potential of merging art and play in the digital world.
The game won a BAFTA award and a La Fletche d'Or. The game was nominated for the Bafta for most instructive game for children, and for the most interactive game for children. The game was featured at the IFFR.
The game was also a commercial success, and become one of the best-selling pieces of Dutch CD-ROM software.

The Aspern Papers (film)

The Aspern Papers is a 2018 period drama, co-written, co-produced and directed by Julien Landais, based on Jean Pavans' scenic adaptation of Henry James' eponymous 1888 novel. The film stars Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Joely Richardson and Vanessa Redgrave; Academy Award-winner James Ivory acting as executive producer.
Plot.
Set in Venice in the late 19th century and based on Henry James' novella of the same name,"The Aspern Papers" is a story of obsession, grandeur lost, and dreams of Byronesque adventures.
Ambitious editor Morton Vint is fascinated by the Romantic poet Jeffrey Aspern and by his icon's short and wildly romantic life. Having travelled from America to Venice, he is determined to get his hands on the letters Aspern wrote to his beautiful lover and muse, Juliana Bordereau.
Now the ferocious guardian of their secrets, Juliana lives in a grand but rather dilapidated Venetian palazzo with her niece, Miss Tina. Posing as prospective lodger, Morton charms Miss Tina, who leads a very quiet life dominated by her aunt. At first hiding his real intentions, he eventually confesses his true passion to Miss Tina. She reluctantly agrees to help him.
But Juliana is suspicious of Morton, and a confrontation between the two of them shows how frail the strong-willed old lady actually is. Morton flees the house. When he returns, he learns of Juliana's death. Miss Tina is now willing to share the infamous letters with him, but the condition she sets is one that Morton finds he cannot fulfill, after all.
Deeply ashamed by the rejection, Tina overcomes her embarrassment and hurt and finds an unknown inner strength. When Morton reconsiders his decision, she confronts him with a revelation.
Release.
"The Aspern Papers" was first screened at the 2018 Venice Film Festival. It was selected as the opening film wth world premiere at 49th International Film Festival in Goa.
Reception.
The film holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from a total of 20 reviews, indicating strong dislike. Several critics lamented the film's sluggishness; John DeFore of "The Hollywood Reporter" called the film "more lifeless than its namesake's long-dead body," while David Lewis of the "San Francisco Chronicle" labeled it "a Merchant-Ivory film - on Quaaludes," giving it 1 out of 4 stars. Many critics considered the performance from Jonathan Rhys-Meyers to be one of the picture's worst aspects; writing for Slant Magazine, Keith Watson said: "Rhys-Meyers is absurdly unconvincing throughout. With his gratingly thin American accent, stilted line readings, and rigid, glowering facial expressions, the actor demonstrates all the range and emotional depth of Derek Zoolander. He evokes none of Vint’s intelligence or passion, rendering him instead a dull, hectoring cipher."

The Necessary Beggar

The Necessary Beggar is an adult science fiction novel written by Susan Palwick. Published on October 1, 2005 by Tor Books, it is the author's second novel. The book received the Alex Award in 2006 and was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award in 2007.
Plot.
"The Necessary Beggar" tells the story of alleged murderer Darroti and his family after he is exiled from the city of Lémabantunk in Gandiffri, a paradisaical land built on the central idea of community. Murder is the sole unforgivable crime in this world, and as Darroti is accused of murdering a mendicant (a holy beggar), his crimes are considered particularly egregious. Darroti's family follows him through the glowing doorway that leads to the randomly selected realm of his exile. They emerge at the entrance of an American refugee camp. Unable to speak the language or explain their origins, the family is prohibited from being officially admitted into the country but impossible to deport. The situation is made worse by the heightened xenophobia present in this year 2022 version of America.
Faced with the guilt of his family's exile, Darroti commits suicide to relieve his loved ones of his burden. Rather than be reincarnated in a new form as he would have been in his homeland, he becomes a ghost. To his dismay, his death throws his father into depression and embitters his other family members. He attempts to provide explanation by entering his father's dreams, but his communications are interpreted as nightmares.
Lisa and Stan, camp volunteers and evangelists, help the family adapt to the new culture. Zamatryna, one of Darroti's nieces, is the quickest to adapt thanks to her high intelligence. When a bomb planted by an anti-immigration group explodes in the camp, Lisa helps the family escape under the guise of death. She allows them to live in the home inherited from her mother with the loose promise of payback at a later date.
Zamatryna continues to flourish in school, convinced that education is the only way to make her family's life easier, while the adults acquire work. She meets a boy named Jerry who slowly convinces her to consider her own desires and open up to those who wish to know her. The final push is made by Darroti when he manipulates the dreams of the more susceptible Jerry. Through Jerry, the family discovers that Darroti didn't murder the mendicant; she was in fact his lover, and under the impression that Darroti had been unfaithful, killed herself. With the truth now known, Darroti's spirit is returned to Lémabantunk. Zama and Jerry marry so that she may gain citizenship and sponsor her family.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" called the novel "a sharp meditation on refugees and displaced persons and a tragicomedy of cultural differences."

History of Christianity in Norway

The history of Christianity in Norway started in the Viking Age in the 9th century. Trade, plundering raids, and travel brought the Norsemen into close contacts with Christian communities, but their conversion only started after powerful chieftains decided to receive baptism during their stay in England or Normandy. Haakon the Good was the first king to make efforts to convert the whole country, but the rebellious pagan chieftains forced him to apostatize. Olaf Tryggvason started the destruction of pagan cult sites in the late 10th century, but only Olaf Haraldsson achieved the official adaption of Christianity in the 1020s. Missionary bishops subjected to the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were responsible for the spread of the new faith before the earliest bishoprics were established around 1100.
Pagan beliefs.
Manuscripts written in the 13th century preserved most information about the Norsemen's pre-Christian religious beliefs. The "Poetic Edda" contain Old Norse poems about the creation and the end of the world. Snorri Sturluson incorporated several myths of Odin, Thor, Týr, and other pagan gods in his "Prose Edda". Odin was the most important god of the pantheon, but he was never regarded omnipotent. The gods were thought to live in farms together with their sposes and children, just like their mortal worshippers. The "Eddas" also mentioned the "jötnar" (or giants), describing them as the gods' superhuman enemies.
Old Norse religious practises are poorly documented. The chieftains were allegedly the religious leaders of their communities, because the existence of a separate cast of priests cannot be detected. Most cult sites, known as "hofs", were large halls built on the chieftains' farms. Gullgubbersmall gold objects decorated with pagan motifsplaced near poles in early medieval buildings in Mære, Klepp, and other places are most frequently interpreted as a sign of a pagan cult center by archaeologists. Christian laws also mentioned outdoor cult sites which were known as . Bans on eating horsemeat after the official conversion to Christianity imply that it was an important element of pagan cults.
Norsemen buried their dead in the ground or cremated them, but they always placed burial gifts in the graves. The wealth and social status of the deceased influenced the size of their graves and the amount of grave goods. The highest-ranking chiefs and their relatives were buried under large burial mounds, but the poorest commoners' graves were almost invisible.
The shamanistic belief system of the nomadic Saami (or Lapps), who lived in the northern regions, was different from the Old Norse religion. The Saami mainly worshipped benevolent goddesses and buried their dead under piles of stones. They were famed for their healing abilities for centuries, but their Christian neighbors often regarded them as wizards and sorcerers.
Middle Ages.
Towards conversion.
Norsemen were brought into close contact with Christian communities in the Viking Age. Reliquary, cross pendants and other objects of Christian provenance easily reached Norway through trade, plundering raids or travel from around 800. Contemporaneous authors wrote of pagan Vikings who wore the sign of cross to mingle freely with the local crowd during their raids. Christian objects were placed in the graves, especially in the graves of wealthy women, but their pagan context suggests that they rarely expressed the dead's adherence to Christianity. A mould for a cross found at Kaupangan important center of commerce in the 9th and 10th centuriesbears testimony to the local production of crosses, but it does not prove the existence of a local Christian community, because foreigners could also be the buyers of such products.
The 13th-century "Heimskringla" attributes the conversion of Norway to four kingsHaakon the Good, Harald Greycloak, Olaf Tryggvason and Olaf Haraldssonwho were baptised abroad in the 10th and 11th centuries. Earlier Christian missionaries are not mentioned in the primary sources. The similar storylines of the four kings' biographies imply that their authors followed a common pattern, but most modern historians accept them as reliable sources. The most ambitious chieftains could strengthen their personal links to foreign rulers through baptism. Fights for the expansion of the new faith enabled the missionary kings to get rid of their enemies, replacing them with their own partisans. The introduction of a professional cast of Christian priests abolished the religious leadership of the kings' heathen rivals. The Christians' belief in one omnipotent God strengthened the ideological basis for a centralized monarchy. Most commoners converted to Christianity either to demonstrate their loyalty to the Christian monarchs or to secure their support.
Haakon the Good was the son of Harald Fairhair whom the sagas credited with the unification of Norway. Harald sent Haakon to England to be brought up in King Æthelstan's court, most probably in token of an alliance between the two kings. Haakon was baptised and Benedictine monks accompanied him back to his homeland around 934 to spread Christian ideas in his kingdom. Sturluson claimed that Haakon also invited a bishop from England. The bishop may have been identical with a monk from the Anglo-Saxon Glastonbury Abbey who was known as "Sigefridus Norwegensis episcopus" ("Sigefrid, bishop of the Norwegians"). The pagan chieftains of Møre and Trøndelag rebelled against Haakon, destroyed the churches that he had built and murdered the Christian missionaries. They also forced the king to apostatize. Archaeologists tentatively date a 10th-century churchyard at Veøy to Haakon's time.
Harald Greycloak, who succeeded Haakon in 961, had been baptised in Northumbria. He also tried to spread Christianity in Norway, but he was forced into exile. The region of Oslo was directly subjected to the rule of Harald Bluetooth, King of Denmark, who had already converted to Christianity. He sent two earls to the territory to force the local inhabitants to adopt Christianity. Some of the 62 Christian graves excavated at St. Clement's Church in Oslo can be dated to Harald Bluetooth's rule.
Olaf Tryggvason was a Viking warlord who had made plundering raids against the coasts of the Baltic Sea and England before being baptized in the early 990s. The tribute that he collected in England enabled him to return to Norway in 995. Adam of Bremen wrote that Tryggvason had been the "first to bring Christianity to Norway"; the monk Oddr Snorrason attributed the conversion of five countriesIceland, Greenland, the Faroe Islands, Orkney, the Hebrides and Shetlandto Tryggvason's missionary campaigns. A saga described him as a ""horg" breaker", referring to the destruction of pagan cult sites during his reign.
Christianization.
Olaf Haraldsson completed the missionary work that his three Christian predecessors had commenced. He was baptized in Rouen in Normandy before he invaded Norway in 1015. Anglo-Saxon clergymen accompanied him to the kingdom, according to the sagas. Anglo-Saxon influence both on the Christian vocabulary of the Norwegian language and on the earliest Christian laws is well-documented. Adam of Bremen claimed that Olaf had also urged the archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen to send German missionaries to Norway.
Olaf convoked a "thing" (or general assembly) to Moster where the official conversion of Norway to Christianity was decided in 1022. The king and Bishop Grimketel introduced the earliest Christian laws at the same assembly. Historians have traditionally interpreted the runic inscription on the Kuli stone as a reference to the "thing", but both the dating of the stone and the reading of the fragment "ris..umr" on it as "kristintumr" ("Christendom") are problematic.
Cnut the Great, King of England and Denmark, and the Norwegian chieftains who supported him expelled Olaf from the country in 1028 or 1029. According to Adam of Bremen, the chieftains rose up against Olaf because he had ordered their wives' execution for witchcraft, but Olaf's most enemies were actually Christians. Cnut is credited with the establishment of a Benedictine monastery in Trondheim by an Anglo-Saxon source, but modern historians do not regard it a reliable source. Olaf returned to Norway and died fighting against his enemies in the Battle of Stiklestad in 1030. Sagas written in the early 1030s testify that Olaf was venerated as a holy king soon after his death.
Court poets rarely referred to pagan myths in their poems written after Olaf's reign, which is a clear sign of the spread of Christian ideas. Archeologically, the process of Christianization cannot be exactly documented, especially because Christian burials cannot be certainly identified and dated. Pagan burials allegedly disappeared between 950 and 1050 in most regions, but the Saami insisted on their traditional faith for centuries. Both written sources and archaeological finds evidence that the new faith spread from the coastlines to the inland regions. The earliest Christian churches were most frequently built on previous heathen cemeteries, but the coexistence of Christian and pagan communities in the same settlements cannot be proved.
Development of Church organization.
The conversion to Christianity brought about the establishment of a hierarchically organized Church in Norway. Only professional clerics could celebrate the Mass which was the central ceremony of Christianity. The clerics also surveyed their parishioners' way of life, because medieval Christians were required to respects a series of rules governing their everyday life. They could not work on ecclesiastical holiday and they had to fast on each Friday.
The archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen were responsible for the missions in Scandinavia. Olaf Haraldsson's half-brother, Harald Hardrada, who was king of Norway from 1046 to 1066, preferred bishops ordained in England or France, but Pope Leo IX confirmed the jurisdiction of the German archbishops in Norway in 1053. Missionary bishops were the first prelates in Norway, but they had no established sees. Adam of Bremen recorded that the Norwegian dioceses had still no defined boundaries in 1076. The "fylki" (or counties), which were important elements of secular administration, became also the basic units of ecclesiastic organization, most probably already during the reign of Olaf Haraldsson. One church was recognized in each "fylki" as the district's principal church. The "fylki" were divided into fourths or eighths and a church of minor rank was established in each subdivision. Wealthy people were allowed to build private churches, known as convenience churches. The earliest churches were built by the monarchs or noblemen and the builders' successors insisted on the appointment of the local priests. Porches of the oldest stave churches were often decorated with scenes from pagan myths. Most stone churches were built on the site of previous stave churches. Anglo-Norman, German and Danish architecture influenced the design of the oldest churches, but a locally inspired style developed in Trondheim in the 11th century.
The first permanent bishopricsBergen, Nidaros and Osloseems to have been founded during the reign of Harald Hardrada's successor, Olaf Kyrre, who died in 1093. They were first listed in a document about the Scandinavian "civitates" (or bishoprics) shortly after 1100. The document is most probably connected to the establishment of the Archbishopric of Lund in Denmark in 1104 by Pope Paschal II, which abolished the jurisdiction of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen in Scandinavia. The large diocese of Bergen was divided into two when a new bishopric was set up at Stavanger around 1125. A fifth diocese was established at Hamar through the division of the bishopric of Oslo in 1153 or 1154.
Sigurd the Crusader ordered the collection of the tithe in 1096 or 1097. The new tax which was regularly collected only from the middle of the 12th century enabled the organization of the first parishes. Sigurd launched a crusade to the Holy Land in 1108. He was the first king to strive for the establishment of an independent Norwegian archbishopric, but only the growing influence of Emperor Frederick Barbarossa in Denmark convinced the pope to support the idea. In March 1152, Cardinal Nicholas Breakspear was appointed papal legate to Norway and Sweden and was tasked with the establishment of new archbishoprics. Breakspear made Jon Birgersson the first archbishop of Nidaros in early 1153. The archbishopric included all Norwegian dioceses and also six bishoprics in the oversea territories. Breakspear also introduced the collection of the Peter's pence (an ecclesiastic tax payable to the Holy See) and organized the first cathedral chapters. Most cathedral chapters consisted of 12 secular canons, each having their own prebend (or regular income).
The first Benedictine monasteries were established around 1100. Nidarholm Abbey was founded at Trondheim by a wealthy nobleman. Munkeliv Abbey and Selje Abbey were established in the early 12th century. The first Cistercian monks came from English abbeys in the 1140s. 
Their earliest abbey was founded at Lyse near Bergen by the local bishop. The first Augustinian community settled in Norway around 1150. Premonstratensians also came to Norway in the middle of the 12th century, but they were not as popular as the Cistercians and Augustinians.
The monarchs' correspondence with the popes show that they regarded themselves the actual rulers of the Norwegian church in the second half of the 11th century. The establishment of the archbishopric at Nidaros strengthened the authority of the Holy See, especially because prelates who had been staunch supporters of the ideas of Gregorian Reform were made archbishops. John Birgersson's successor, Eysteinn Erlendsson, crowned the minor Magnus Erlingsson king in 1163 or 1164. Both the "Law of Succession", which was issued before the ceremony, and the king's coronation oath emphasized that the monarchs should rule justly and seek advice from the prelates. Archbishop Eysteinn also persuaded the king to confirm the privileges of the clergy around 1170. The Gregorian ideas were actually not fully adopted. Clerical celibacy, for instance, was not still a rule. The "Canones Nidrosienses"a collection of local canonsintroduced a ban on marriage between a priest and a widow or a divorced woman, but otherwise ordinary priests were allowed to contract formal marriages. Pope Gregory IX forbade the Norwegian priests to marry in 1237, but most of them continued to live with women and father children. Concubinage could never be suppressed and priests' children were more easily acknowledged as legitimate heirs than in other parts of Catholic Europe.
Sverre Sigurdsson who defeated and killed Magnus Erlingsson in 1184 refused to confirm the privileges of the Church. He insisted on his right to appoint his candidates to the most important churches and to interfere in the election of bishops. Archbishop Eysteinn and his successor, Eirik Ivarsson, were forced into exile. Sverre crowned himself king in 1194 and refused to accept Pope Innocent III's judgement in favor of the exiled archbishop. After all Norwegian bishops fled to Denmark to join their archbishop, the pope excommunicated the king. The king's views were summarized in the "Speech against the Bishops", which emphasized the monarchs' direct link to God. Sverre's son, Haakon III, was reconciled with the Holy See. The bishops' right to appoint the parish priests was confirmed, but the church builders' successors preserved the right to present their candidates to the bishops. The expansion of the Nidaros Cathedral in Gothic style started in the 1180s and was completed in the 1210s. The cathedral became the center of the cult of St Olaf.
The mendicant orders settled in Scandinavia in the 1220s. The Dominicans were the first to come, and the Franciscans soon followed them. Haakon Haakonson, who mounted the throne in 1217, was the first king to make serious efforts to convert the Saami. A Saami mystic convinced Margaret I to support new missions among the Saami in the 1380s, but the vast majority of the Saami remained pagans.

South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal

The South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register (from 5 July 1845) and South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal (from 9 October 1847) was a weekly publication in the colony of South Australia which included notices from and about the government between 1845 and 1852.
History.
The colony of South Australia's first publication, called "South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register", changed its name on 15 June 1839 to become the "South Australian Register". Later, in 1845, publisher George Stevenson appropriated the vacancy by publishing his own version under the same name. According to the State Library of South Australia:George Stevenson founded the South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal, originally and confusingly titled the South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register after Adelaide's first newspaper. Stevenson edited the South Australian Register with an aggressive outspokenness, and continued this approach in his new title. He stated he would be campaigning for free trade, reduced taxes, alterations to the scheme of land sales. Most of all, this newspaper led the call for fully representative government. The newspaper’s title change reflected the founding of major mine ventures at Burra and elsewhere. The earlier spirited inter-press debate continued with this fourth major newspaper, alongside the Register, South Australian, and Adelaide Times. ... The newspaper was forced to close in 1852 due to the lack of labour and cash brought by the exodus of men to the Victorian goldfields. Faced with his entire staff leaving for the gold rush, Stevenson closed the newspaper and joined them.Volume 1, number 1 of the "South Australian Gazette and Colonial Register" was published on Saturday, 5 July 1845. The final edition under that title was Volume III number 118 on 2 October 1847. Volume III number 119 of the "South Australian Gazette and Mining Journal" was published the following Saturday, 9 October 1847. The publication ceased with the printing of Volume 7, no. 516 (13 March 1852).

Women in Malayalam literature

Women's writing in Malayalam is a category of Malayalam literature that runs counter to the dominant public sphere in Kerala. It comprises women's fiction, poetry, and short stories and has a long tradition in Malayalam literature. The "pennezhuthu" category is its most decisive and controversial form, changing the historiography of women's writing in India and the images of certain writers and writing trends. Malayalam literature's most significant female authors are K. Saraswathi Amma, Rajalakshmi, Lalithambika Antharjanam and Madhavikutty (Kamala Das), best known for their narrating of "woman's space". Women's literary writing in Malayala is part of a tradition of resistance and contributes to the women's cause through the merging of the public and the private spheres. Women's writing emerged in India as a new subject of research and critical studies in the 1980s as a result of the feminist movement and as a consequence of growing interest in feminist historiography.
As a discursive practice, women's writing is among the wider cultural context of patriarchy and its structural manifestations. Despite the varying specificity of content under different modes of production, patriarchy can be described in terms of the dominance of the male and a corresponding marginalization of women. Women's writing is important as a response to patriarchal relations within patriarchy itself. It may provide a unique record of the systems which shape and contain the life stories of women.
Women can identify women's writing as a struggle "which involves both dominant perceptions of social reality and the resistances to it". In this sense, women's writings are significant documents in the analysis of women's spaces, which demonstrate the making and remaking of these spaces while recording their resistances to the outside world. Feminist historiography, while deconstructing dominant ways of writing women's history, considers women's writing itself to be history writing.
Two terms are used in relation to the subject: women-writing and women's writing. Women's writing refers simply to writings by women. Women-writing usually denotes the phenomenon of women's writing and its emergence as a new discipline within women's studies.
Women from most of the dominant communities, who had access to education, started writing by the second half of the 19th century. They wrote in journals and magazines in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Susie Tharu and Lalitha identify the period as "a high point of women's journalism and in almost every region, women edited journals for women and many hundreds of women wrote in them." There were several magazines including "Keraliya Suguna Bodhini" (1886), "Sarada" (1904), "Lakshmibai" (1905), "Mahilaratnam" (1916), "Mahila" (1921), "Sahodari" (1925), "Mahilamandiram" (1927), "Malayalam Anika" (1931), and "Street" (1933) during this period, and journals for women from various communities. Most of the journals carried articles written by women on issues such as health, education, child rearing, family, etc. All these writings, which basically followed the writings of some male reformers, reflected the attempt to create a model Malayali woman by mixing tradition and modernity in appropriate quantities. These attempts could be viewed as early attempts at bringing "private" issues into "public" notice. But the image that was being constructed across communities and identities consisted largely of an ideal middle class woman who was educated, homely and suitable for a modern educated man.
Jancy James notes that the shift from verse to prose in women's expression is related to women's education. Women writers such as Lalithambika Antharjanam (1909−1985) and K. Saraswathi Amma (1919−1975) used prose efficiently and frequently, although there were writers such as Mary John Thottam or Sister Mary Benigna (1901−1985), Koothattukulam Mary John (1905−?), Kadathanattu Madhavi Amma (1909−1999), and Balamani Amma (1909−2004) who wrote in verse. For most of these women writers, education functioned more as an indirect means of access to the public sphere than as a means merely to read and write. Unlike earlier women-writers who wrote in Sanskrit, women who had access to modern education expressed their own experiences in their own languages.

Tarvisio–Udine railway

Tarvisio–Udine railway is an Italian railway line that connects Udine and Tarvisio. It is also called the ferrovia Pontebbana in Italian after the town of Pontebba, which was located near the former border between Italy and Austria-Hungary during the first thirty years of its operation.
History.
In the 1850s, proposals were made in the Austrian Empire for the building of a railway line from Bruck an der Mur, located on the Austrian Southern Railway (German: "Südbahn"), passing through Villach, Tarvisio and Udine to facilitate connections between Vienna and Venice. The Venice–Udine railway, completed in 1860, was also built as part of this plan.
Villach was connected to the Southern Railway by the Innichen–Maribor railway ("Drautalbahn") in 1864. It was planned to extend this line to Franzensfeste (Fortezza) on the Brenner Railway, and it was also planned to connect Villach to Leoben and Bruck an der Mur via the projected Rudolf Railway ("Rudolfsbahn"). In this context, the possibility was studied of creating a connection between Vienna and Trieste as an alternative to the Semmering line that could also be used for a route between Innsbruck and the Port of Trieste. Two projects were developed:
With the passage of the provinces of Veneto and Udine to Italy after the Third War of Independence, the Udine line project was temporarily set aside in favour of the Predil line.
Construction.
At the instigation of the Società per le Ferrovie dell'Alta Italia (SFAI), which had same shareholders as the Southern Railway (operating the Austrian part of the Udine–Trieste railway), Italy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire agreed for the construction of a railway line between Udine and Tarvisio. This railway would follow the Udine route, passing through Gemona del Friuli and Pontebba, near which the border crossing would be located.
The construction of the Italian section line was entrusted to the SFAI and the Austrian section to the "k.k.p. Kronprinz Rudolf Bahn" (KRB), which already operated the Rudolf Railway.
The whole line was opened on 30 October 1879. Several sections were opened in succession between 1875 and 1879. The section between Udine and Gemona del Friuli was opened on 15 November del 1875, while Carnia station was reached on 18 December of the following year. Then it was the turn of Resiutta, reached on 17 May 1877, and of Chiusaforte, reached on 14 March 1878. The Chiusaforte–Pontebba section was opened on 25 July 1879, while the Austrian section was opened on 11 October of the same year.
First years of operations.
In 1884, Austria-Hungary nationalised the lines of the KRB so that the operation of the Austrian part of the railway passed to the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways ("Kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen", "KkStb").
The following year, following the Railway Convention of 1885, the Italian section became part of the Rete Adriatica (Adriatic Network), operated by the Società Italiana per le Strade Ferrate Meridionali.
In 1905, the operation of the line was taken over by the Ferrovie dello Stato.
After the First World War.
In 1919, the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye established the border between Italy and Austria beyond the Alpine watershed, near Tarvisio. The local station, which was initially called "Tarvisio Sobborghi" and then "Tarvisio Centrale", became a border station and the control of the Pontafel (Italian: Pontebba)–Tarvisio section passed to Ferrovie dello Stato. 
From January 1944, all direct railway lines between Italy and Germany were bombed, except for the Tarvisio–Udine railway, as some key bridges (Dogna and Muro) on it were difficult to target. From 8 September 1944, the border station was abolished and the line became the only connection between Italy and Germany and was used by all the trains carrying prisoners bound for the extermination camps as well as supply trains.
After the Second World War.
Upgrading work was carried out on the line in the 1960s; in particular, new passenger buildings were erected in the stations of Tarvisio Centrale and , and in the latter the freight facilities were doubled in capacity. The new works were opened in November 1969.
In the last quarter of the twentieth century the whole line was rebuilt with the old single-track and winding line replaced by a double-track line with better curves. The new line was opened in stages from 1985 to 2000. Most of the new line north of Carnia opened in 2000 runs through long tunnels.
Features.
The railway infrastructure is managed by the Rete Ferroviaria Italiana, which classifies it as one of its primary lines. This importance is due to the role of connection between Italy and Austria, since it connects to the Rudolf Railway in , allowing connections to Villach, Klagenfurt, Vienna and Linz.
The line is double-track from the Vat crossing loop ("Posto di Movimento Vat", "PM Vat") to , while it is single-track on the short initial section. Electrification is at 3,000 volts DC. The gauge is .
Since 2000, it has been substantially rebuilt with the opening of the new section from Carnia to Tarvisio, most of which in the tunnel, Subsequently the old single-track and tortuous line and all its stations were dismantled. The only part of the old line preserved is at Pontebba station.
The PM Vat–Tarvisio Boscoverde section is equipped with "Sistema di Comando e Controllo" ("Command and Control System", an Italian form of centralised traffic control), so circulation is regulated by an operations centre manager at . The P.M. Vat– section is also regulated by the operations centre manager at Venezia Mestre.
The line connects with other lines at both ends (Tarvisio and Udine) and the line to Sacile branches off in Gemona del Friuli.
Route.
 
From Udine to Carnia, the line basically follows the same route that existed before 1995, while from Carnia to Tarvisio it has been completely rebuilt, coinciding with the old line only at Pontebba station.
In the first of these sections there is a deviation, built in 1985, in the area of Tricesimo, which led to the abandonment of Tricesimo station in favour of the nearest station of . The doubling of the track in the northern section of this deviation involved, among other things, the demolition of the overpass of the Udine–Tarcento electric tramway. A deviation was built between Gemona del Friuli and Carnia in 1992, which replaced the stations of Gemona-Ospedaletto (already closed in 1962) and Venzone, which were replaced by the new Venzone station).
From Carnia the railway runs along a short straight viaduct, subsequently entering the Campiolo-Palis tunnel, at the exit of which follows a very short viaduct and a second tunnel, located under Mount Zuc dal Bor, which ends near Pontebba.
At the Pontebba goods yard there are the remains of the buildings of the large customs office, used until the European Single Market entered into force in 1993. The system of tracks has been reduced to four tracks, three of which are reserved for passenger services.
From Pontebba the line enters another tunnel and emerges at the halt of Bagni Santa Caterina, which was abandoned in 2003. The railway enters a tunnel to Ugovizza-Valbruna station, which replaces the former Ugovizza and Valbruna stations, but is far from both villages. The route of the tunnel between Pontebba and Ugovizza-Valbruna follows a sort of "M", coming out into the open only in the middle of the M, near Bagni S. Caterina.
After Ugovizza-Valbruna, the line enters the tunnel again, bypassing the towns of Camporosso and Tarvisio and ends at the new Tarvisio Boscoverde station. This station has been active since 2000 replacing the former Tarvisio Centrale station, which it lies parallel to, about 500 metres away. The original Tarvisio station, which stood in a better position to serve the town, has not been restored, as the railway passes through a tunnel in the Tarvisio area. After Tarvisio Boscoverde, the line connects at the Austrian border with the Rudolf Railway, which continues to Villach.
The old line, on the other hand, followed the course of the Fella river. It was equipped with many viaducts and bridges of great scenic interest and ran through all the towns along the river. It was replaced because it was subject to landslides and floods and because, being single-track, it was no longer adequate for the freight traffic that had been developing.
Only one, approximately two kilometres-long, single-track section remains, between Udine station and the Vat crossing loop; the Udine belt railway, branches off to the south from the latter, allowing the passage of freight trains to Cervignano and Gorizia without entering Udine station.
Traffic.
Freight.
Freight traffic is intense; in particular, trains from Austria continue towards the ports of Trieste or Venice.
Passengers.
The regional service consists of some Trenitalia services running between and as well as two pairs of services on the Udine–Villach cross-border route, carried out by a collaboration between the Società Ferrovie Udine-Cividale, which supplies the locomotives, and the ÖBB which provides the carriages, as part of the "Micotra" service.
There are also various international connections operated by the ÖBB with the use of its own rolling stock, while the driving and traction staff on Italian territory is provided by Trenord for EC/EN trains and Trenitalia for EN 234/235 trains:
In addition, the ÖBBs also maintain a bus service, called "Intercitybus", which connects Venezia Mestre station and to Klagenfurt and Villach. The service to Villach connects with trains to Salzburg and Vienna.
Previously the number of international connections was greater: the Eurocity Allegro Johann Strauss, which connected to Vienna Südbahnhof and was the last daytime connection between Italy and Austria using the Pontebbana, was discontinued in 2009. In order to restore a daytime service between Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Carinthia, the two local administrations activated in 2012 an experimental service between Udine and Villach called "Miglioramento dei collegamenti transfrontalieri di trasporto pubblico" ("Micotra", "improvement of cross-border public transport connections"). Then, from the timetable change of 15 December 2013, the ÖBB restored a pair of EuroCity services on the Venice –Vienna route. A second pair of EuroCity services between Venice and Vienna was reintroduced starting from the timetable change on 10 December 2017.

Mandatory (typeface)

Mandatory is a typeface developed from the Charles Wright typeface, introduced for use on vehicle registration plates of the United Kingdom. Its block letters and numbers are designed to prevent easy modification and to improve legibility, with stroke separation on the M and W which are pointed at the centre, and the tail of the Q which is thinner and clearer. It was developed in the United Kingdom, and is also used by Brazil, where it has been mandatory between 2008 and 2018, before the adoption of Mercosur plates. The Mandatory font can be downloaded free for personal use from K-Type.
In the United Kingdom, characters on vehicle registration plates purchased from 1 September 2001 must use Mandatory typeface and conform to set specifications as to width, height, stroke, spacing and margins. The physical characteristics of the number plates are set out in British Standard BS AU 145d, which specifies visibility, strength, and reflectivity.

Trafic: Revue de cinéma is a French arts and letters journal focusing on cinema. The journal enjoys a significant position in debates about cinema and the moving image in France, and to a lesser degree internationally, due to the varied and extensive list of authors who have contributed to it over the past three decades. These have included philosophers such as Giorgio Agemben and Jacques Rancière, film scholars such as Jacques Aumont, filmmakers such as João César Monteiro, and critics such as Kent Jones and Jonathan Rosenbaum.
"Trafic" is published by P.O.L, the publishing house established in 1983 by , director of the autobiographical documentary "Editeur" (2017) in which he meditates on his experiences working with "the great names of contemporary literature" who lent prestige to his press. These "great names" include Serge Daney, who founded "Trafic." Garin Dowd, Professor of Critical Theory and Film at the London College of Music and Media,"" describes Daney as "widely recognized in his homeland as the most important French film critic after André Bazin." The journal "Trafic," subsequent to Daney's "death from AIDS in 1992, has continued his legacy," its first issue appearing in Winter 1991 (available January 1992). Alongside Serge Daney and , the journal's co-founder, the editorial board also included Raymond Bellour, and , with Otchakovsky-Laurens acting as supervising editor.

Mulkaji

Mulkaji () was the position of head of executive of Kingdom of Nepal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It was equivalent to Prime Minister of Nepal. There were 5 Mulkajis appointed between 1785 and 1804.
Meaning.
"Mulkaji" is formed from two words: "Mul" and "Kaji". "Mul" means "Chief", "Key" or "Fundamental" and "Kaji" is derived from Sanskrit word "Karyi" which meant "functionary". Altogether it means "Chief Functionary" or "Executive Head of the State".
History of the five Mulkajis.
Abhiman Singh Basnyat.
Dewan Kaji Bamsa Raj Pande was beheaded on March 1785 on the conspiracy of Queen Rajendra Laxmi with the help of supporters including senior Kaji Swaroop Singh Karki. On 2 July 1785, Prince Regent Bahadur Shah of Nepal was arrested and on the eleventh day of imprisonment on 13 July, Queen Rajendra Laxmi died. Then onwards, Bahadur Shah of Nepal took over the regency of his nephew King Rana Bahadur Shah and the position of Chautariya while Abhiman Singh Basnyat was elected Mulkaji (Chief Kaji).
Kirtiman Singh Basnyat.
In 1794, King Rana Bahadur Shah came of age and appointed Kirtiman Singh Basnyat as Chief ("Mul") Kaji among the newly appointed four Kajis though Damodar Pande was the most influential Kaji. Kirtiman had succeeded Abhiman Singh Basnyat as Chief Kaji.
Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat.
Kirtiman was secretly assassinated on 28 September 1801, by the supporters of Raj Rajeshwari Devi and his brother Bakhtawar Singh Basnyat, was then given the post of Chief ("Mul") Kaji.
Damodar Pande.
Later Damodar Pande was appointed by Queen Rajrajeshwari as Chief Kaji.
Ranajit Pande.
After the execution of Mulkaji Damodar Pande on March 1804, Ranajit Pande was appointed as Mulkaji (Chief Kaji) along with Bhimsen Thapa as second Kaji, Sher Bahadur Shah as Mul Chautariya and Ranganath Paudel as Raj Guru (Royal Preceptor).
Later King Rana Bahadur Shah created the title of Mukhtiyar and assume full executive power of the state.
Controversial Mulkaji.
Historian Dilli Raman Regmi asserts that Sarbajit Rana Magar was chosen as Chief Functionary. Historian Rishikesh Shah asserts that Sarbajit was appointed only a Kaji and was the head of the Nepalese government for a short period in 1778.

Eurytion (king of Phthia)

Eurytion (, "widely honoured") or Eurythion () was a king of Phthia. He was also counted among the Argonauts and the Calydonian hunters. The writer Tzetzes called Eurytion as Eurytus. 
Family.
Eurytion was the swift son of either of Irus and Demonassa, or of Kenethos and Cerion, and father of Antigone. His father was also called Actor, king of Phthia who otherwise known as his grandfather for Irus was the son of Actor. If Eurytion's father was Irus, he was the brother of Eurydamas, also an Argonaut. 
Mythology.
When Peleus fled away from Aegina because of the murder of his half-brother Phocus, he was received and purified by Eurytion at his Phthian court. In addition, the king also offered the son of Aeacus a third part of the kingdom to rule over and his daughter Antigone to marry. 
In the times when the voyage of the Argonauts took place, Eurytion was known to let his hair grew until he was safe at home again. Together with his son-in-law, he also goes to Calydon to answer the call from King Oeneus to kill the Calydonian Boar which ravaged the said country. There, along with the other hunters, they were hospitably entertained by the king for ten days and during the hunt, Peleus forcefully thrown a spear that missed the giant wild hog but inadvertently struck his father-in-law. Eurytion died in the woods caused by that deadly wound in his chest while Peleus then fled from Phthia to Iolcus, where he was purified by King Acastus. Later on, the hero brought together many sheep and cattle and led them to Irus as blood money for the slaying of his son but Irus would not accept this price from Peleus and sent him away.

The Masked Prosecutor

The Masked Prosecutor is a 1999 Hong Kong action film directed by Herman Yau and starring Louis Koo, Blackie Ko and Jordan Chan. Koo plays the title character, a vigilante who punishes criminals who escapes from justice.
Plot.
In Hong Kong, a vigilante known as the Masked Prosecutor have been punishing criminals who were sentenced not guilty by the court, which include a 15-year-old teenager (Lam Tsz-sin) who pushed a couple down the hill in a robbery but was proven to be psychopathic, Ng Mang (Frankie Ng), a triad leader involved in a gang negotiation in Temple Street which caused one killed and three injured but was released due to lack of evidence, and Leung Siu-chueng (Wayne Lai), director of Yun Man Industry Limited who was acquitted from a rape charge because the jury believed the accuser was having too much sex fantasies. The Masked Prosecutor's punishment involves forcing his detainees to listen to Hindu Buddhist chanting music, whipping them with a cane and tattooing a number on their arm for them to remember their chronological order of his being his detainee before tossing them outside the police station.
Officer Wah Kai-lun (Jordan Chan) was assigned to work on the case of the Masked Prosecutor with veteran officer Wan Ping-kai (Blackie Ko), known as Guy, who is six months away from retirement. Wah and Guy proceed to interrogate the three detainees in the hospital. Afterwards, Wah visits Guy's house and notices the lack of photographs present there. Guy's daughter, Siu-yu (Grace Yip) shows Wah a photo album with pictures of her family along with a picture of Guy with his godsons, Tong Hiu-tai (Louis Koo) and Wan Chi-nin (Michael Tse), who were also police officers and the trio were known as the Three Eagles of Mongkok. Wah takes the picture of the trio with him and tries to find clues while listening to the interrogations by the three detainees.
At this time, it is also reported that Kwong Cho-foon (Lo Mang), who was involved in a gold shop robbery two years ago where he also killed a man and crippling his daughter, have been acquitted of all charges. Wah plans to use Kwong to lure out the Masked Prosecutor. On the night of the operation, the Masked Prosecutor appears, attacking and attempts to abduct Kwong in a massage parlour before being interfered by Wah. The Masked Prosecutor gets into a scuffle with Wah where gains the upper and was about to shoot Wah before leaving the scene as uniformed officers arrive. Guy, who was slacking in a Cha chaan teng, also arrives and gets into an argument with Wah when the latter reveals that he suspect Guy is acquainted with the Masked Prosecutor, who Wah suspects to be Guy's godson, Hiu-tai.
Hiu-tai, who was once a police officer, was charged for manslaughter after killing a robber who surrendered. Because of this, Wah suspects Hiu-tai, but Guy refuses to believe Hiu-tai to be the Masked Prosecutor. Guy, who was present when Tong killed the robber, reveals the story: three years ago, Guy became sworn brothers and a godfather to Hiu-tai and Chi-nin. During that occasion, the trio were called upon for an operation to arrest drug dealers. A gunfight and chase ensues and two of the suspects were apprehended. While chasing down the final criminal, Hiu-tai mistakenly shoots and kills Chi-nin, which Guy was unaware of. Devastated, Hiu-tai kills the final suspect even the latter has surrendered. Guy has planned to quit the force if Hiu-tai loses his job, but refrains after realizing he would be missing out HK$1 million of pension after he retire. Therefore, Guy believes Hiu-tai resents him.
To continue on the investigation, Guy and Wah visit the Solvia-Pokka-Fuji Family Rehab Center, where Hiu-tai used to hang out with his girlfriend Ada (Jessica Hsuan), who was Chi-nin's older sister. There, they see Hiu-tai helping out an old lady before walking into a cha chaan teng. There, Wah straight up asks Hiu-tai whether he is the Masked Prosecutor, bu the latter walks away without saying a word.
In the middle of night, Hiu-tai gives a call to Wah and tells him he plans to kill Kwong because of Wah's interference. Wah sends his subordinate to protect Kwong and stations him in a hotel room. Hiu-tai, disguised as a Buddhist monk, sneaks into the hotel and takes down Wah's subordinates before entering into Kwong's hotel room and killing him. Wah proceeds to chase Hiu-tai outside the streets and when he finally caught up, he points his gun at Hiu-tai. Hiu-tai ignores him and Wah fires a shot. As Wah walks over to cuff Hiu-tai, Guy appears and knocks Wah unconscious and drives Hiu-tai away from the scene. Guy urges Hiu-tai to stop what he is doing because it is illegal, but Hiu-tai refuses, stating he rather die than go to jail as he was tortured by criminals he helped incarcerate when he was in prison. Hiu-tai believes he is doing the right thing because the world is unfair that criminals can get away from the justice as long as they can afford to pay good lawyers. Hiu-tai also promises to leave Hong Kong and will only return after Guy retires.
The next day, Guy was arrested by the Internal Affairs for assaulting Wah and helping Hiu-tai escape. When Hiu-tai was about to leave Hong Kong, he hears about Guy's arrest on the news, he gives a call to Wah, accusing Wah of pushing a cop to hell since Guy would either be killed or commit suicide if he will be imprisoned. Hiu-tai also threatens to kill Wah if Guy goes to jail. As Guy is being escorted to prison, Guy kills several police officers and attempts to free Guy. Also, it turns out to a scheme set up by Wah. As Hiu-fai flees, Wah gives chase, from a foot chase leading to a car chase until Hiu-fai's car explodes after running into another car. Hiu-tai narrowly escapes the explosion and gets into a brief scuffle with Wah and manages to snatch the latter's pistol. The police arrives and Hiu-tai hold Wah hostage. Eventually, Hiu-tai empties the pistol and pushes Wah away, pretending to fire at the cops.
In the end, Hiu-tai'a ashes were taken by Guy and placed them next to Chi-nin's at the temple, where Guy, Wah and Siu-yu pay their respects. It is also revealed that Wah changed his testimony so Guy would not end up in prison. There, they encounter Ada, who has become a nun.

Domino (2019 film)

Domino is a 2019 crime thriller film directed by Brian De Palma and starring Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Carice van Houten, Guy Pearce, and Eriq Ebouaney. It was an international co-production filmed on-location in locations across Europe, including Denmark, Belgium, Spain, and Italy. It tells the story of a Danish police officer (Coster-Waldau) who is seeking justice for the murder of his partner by a vengeful man (Ebouaney), hampered by the fact that his target is a CIA informant.
In the United States, it was released direct-to-VOD on May 31, 2019, by Saban Films, but received theatrical releases in other territories. It received generally negative reviews. De Palma has expressed discontentment with the final film, revealing in interviews that due to production issues, considerable sections of the original script were not filmed as intended.
Plot.
Copenhagen police officers Christian Toft and Lars Hansen are sent to check out a reported domestic disturbance in an apartment. When they arrive, they find a man trying to leave the building with blood on his shoes. Toft assumes he’s the domestic assailant and handcuffs him. Hansen send him upstairs to go check on the man’s wife, when Toft realizes he accidentally left his gun at home. He takes Hansen’s and goes upstairs, only to find the apartment filled with firearms, plastic explosives, and a man lying dead with his throat slit and fingers removed. Using a hidden knife, the assailant breaks free from his restraints and attacks Hansen, inadvertently cutting his throat. The wounded Hansen tells Toft to give chase before losing consciousness. Toft pursues the assailant across the rooftop, but both fall several stories. While Toft lies incapacitated, he sees three men come up and knock the assailant out before taking him away.
The police identify the assailant from fingerprints as Ezra Tarzi, a Libyan emigrant and former Special Forces operative whose parents had been killed by Salah Al-Din, an ISIS commander known as “Sheikh”. Al-Din, who smuggles weapons and explosives through a tomato importer based in Brussels, is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks which he films and edits before posting them online. Tarzi’s victim, Farooq Hares, was one of Al-Din’s lieutenants, and Tarzi was trying to get to him. Toft wants to pursue Tarzi to bring him to justice, but is suspended by his superior Detective Wold after he learns that Toft misplaced his service weapon, and is interrogated by internal affairs inspector Alex Boe.
Meanwhile, Tarzi and his family have been abducted by CIA agent Joe Martin, who has relentlessly pursued Al-Din ever since he killed five of his colleagues years earlier. Martin pressures a reluctant Tarzi into working on his behalf by threatening to reveal his murderous deeds to his children. He sends him first after Hares’ nephew in Copenhagen, but during the struggle the younger Hares breaks loose and throws himself to his death. Tarzi manages to find several hidden cellphones in the apartment, from which Martin traces calls from a restaurant in Almería. They deduce that Al-Din intends to use a ferry to escape to friendly territory in North Africa, where he’ll be effectively untraceable. Tarzi travels to Almería and attempts to find Al-Din by torturing one of his underlings, but gets nothing.
Despite being suspended, Toft remains resolute in finding Tarzi. Along with Boe, who also wants to avenge Hansen, the two travel unsupervised to Brussels, but during the drive receive a phone call from Hansen’s wife Hanne that he has died in hospice. Heartbroken, Alex reveals that she and Lars had been having an affair and he’d been intending to divorce Hanne and start a family with her. When a shocked Toft pushes back, Boe reveals intimate photos of the two together and an ultrasound, indicating she's carrying his child.
The two fail to find leads in Brussels, but learn that Tarzi has been spotted in Almería and quickly change course for southern Spain. As they’re driving from the airport, they spot one of Al-Din’s tomato delivery trucks, and Toft deduces the connection. They follow the truck, eventually stumbling across Al-Din himself in another. They follow him to a bullfighting area, where he and several others splinter off into the ring and nearby building. Toft follows Al-Din to the roof of the building, while Boe follows the others into the arena, where she spots one of them causing a distraction while another gets into a strategic location. Al-Din’s men fly a camera drone into the arena, intending to film their comrade’s suicide bombing. Just in the nick of time, Toft and Boe realize what is happening and intervene, shooting Al-Din in the process.
Boe calls Wold, who in turn calls Martin, who proposes a trade - Tarzi for Al-Din. They meet on the rooftop, but Al-Din dies from his wounds. A distraught Tarzi asks Toft to kill him, but Martin makes clear that he intends to use the vengeful assassin as an asset for years to come. Suddenly, Boe arrives and shoots and kills Tarzi, avenging Lars. A disappointed Martin walks away, leaving an emotionally-drained Toft and Boe alone.
Production.
In 2017, Brian De Palma began to shoot "Domino" in Málaga, and continued in Almería at the airport, the bullring and the port. Walk-on extras were selected at the Estadio de los Juegos Mediterráneos. Shooting in the Almería bullring was cut short due to problems with the number of extras required. Christina Hendricks was replaced by Carice van Houten in the lead female role. When shooting finished in Spain, De Palma moved on to continue in Denmark.
Despite De Palma denying rumors that the final cut, clocking in at 89 minutes, was shortened against his wishes (an erroneous original running time of 148 minutes had been cited by reviewers), he declared: "I was not involved in the ADR, the musical recording sessions, the final mix or the color timing of the final print." In an interview with "theplaylist.net" he precised: ""Domino" is not my project, I did not write the script [...]. I had a lot of problems in financing [it]. I never experienced such a horrible movie set. A large part of our team has not even been paid yet by the Danish producers. [...] This was my first experience in Denmark and most likely my last."
Release.
The film was released on May 31, 2019.
Reception.
Box office.
"Domino" grossed $426,238.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 69 reviews, with an average rating of 4.46/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "A rote thriller whose few flourishes serve as bittersweet reminders of its director's glory days, "Domino" continues a streak of DePalma disappointments." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 40 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".
Benjamin Lee of "The Guardian" gave the film 1 out of 5 stars, writing, "What's most frustrating about "Domino" is just how invisible De Palma has become, bringing a tired script to screen without any real panache or even effort, the work of a man who's seemingly given up." 
David Fear of "Rolling Stone" gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, describing it as "A messy, uneven, heavy-handed, occasionally inspired, often insipid, steroidally stylistic De Palma joint, but one that fits the description in enough fits and starts to warrant the claim." 
Peter Sobcynzki of "RogerEbert.com" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, writing, "This is not a great Brian De Palma film in the end, but its best moments will remind you of just how great he can be."

Controversy.
In 2016, hundreds of parents and some teachers protested outside the school for several days over disagreements with the school's leadership. This led to the school being closed for one week. The protesters claimed there to be an anti-Indian sentiment and inappropriate language towards female members of staff. In addition, there were claims that the school would discriminate against students bringing their own food instead of using the onsite caterer, Sodexo.
Some teachers on the other hand defended the schools' leadership, citing cultural differences which may have led to misunderstandings or misinterpretations.
The school reopened after assurances had been given pending an investigation.
In 2017, CBSE disaffiliated the school, and now only the IB section remains.

Red House Museum and Gardens, Christchurch

The Red House Museum and Gardens is a museum of local history located in Christchurch, Dorset. The red-brick Georgian building was constructed in 1764 as the parish workhouse. Early in the 20th century it was acquired by local antiquarian Herbert Druitt and his collections provided the basis for a public museum that opened in 1951. The Red House is now a Grade II* listed building.
History.
In 1745 the churchwardens and Overseers of the Poor for Christchurch purchased a barn on the corner of Church Lane and Quay Road to provide "more comfortable support" for the town's numerous poor. In 1764 a purpose-built, red-brick poorhouse was constructed on the site, and this remained in use as the local workhouse until it was replaced in 1881 by a larger Union Workhouse that had been newly constructed in the fields to the north of the town. The last inmates to leave the increasingly decrepit Quay Road site were the "juvenile paupers", the children, who were finally relocated in 1886.
The dilapidated building was bought at auction by the Rev Thomas H Bush, the vicar of the nearby Priory Church, who named it the 'RedHouse'. The Rev Bush undertook many alterations and demolished some of the buildings. He erected stables on the site of the original barn, transformed the former exercise yards into gardens, and built a stone garden wall facing Quay Road where the women's ward had previously stood. The Red House remained a family home until the death of Rev Bush in 1909.
The Red House was then purchased by Matilda Druitt, the widow of solicitor James Druitt, whose home in the High Street is now Christchurch Library. After her death in 1916 the Red House passed to her solicitor son Herbert who, being a passionate local antiquarian and an outspoken champion of the town's history, used it as a storehouse for his vast collection of local documents, archaeological artefacts, and works of art. Although Herbert Druitt would open the Red House to visitors by private arrangement, his desire that it should become a permanent museum for the town remained unrealised before his death in 1943. The Red House passed to his sister Charlotte, who gifted the building to the town in 1947.
It took the trustees of the new museum three years to get the Red House and its overgrown garden to a state in which it could fulfil Charlotte's legacy and Herbert's wish. It was intended that the Red House should be more than just a museum and the executors of artist Graham Robertson donated £1,000 towards the cost of an art gallery. The opening ceremony of the Red House Museum was performed on Wednesday 30th May 1951 by Sir Donald Bailey, the inventor of the military Bailey Bridge, who lived locally. Because it was opened as part of the town's Festival of Britain celebrations, entry was free for the first two weeks, after which a sixpenny (6d) entry fee was introduced.
In 1971 the running of the Museum was taken over by Hampshire County Council. Following the changes to the county boundaries in 1974, when Christchurch was transferred from Hampshire to Dorset, Hampshire County Council retained control and set up a joint management agreement with Dorset County Council and Christchurch Borough Council.
Present Day.
The Red House Museum is a free entry museum of local history. The ground floor features a Kitchen Gallery, Victorian Bygones Gallery, costume and fashion collections, and an exhibition of 1930s furniture by the noted Christchurch-based craftsman Arthur Romney Green. The Main Gallery in the former stables hosts regular temporary exhibitions.
On the first floor there are Archaeology Galleries covering significant local Bronze Age and Saxon burials and finds associated with Hengistbury Head. There is a Local History Resource Room with public access to several thousand historical photographs, local trade directories, electoral registers, and other research material. There is also an archive of historical documents that is viewable by appointment.
The gardens include a courtyard, Herb Garden, and larger South Garden.
The Red House Museum is presently owned by Hampshire County Council and operated by the Hampshire Cultural Trust. It receives funding from Dorset County Council and Christchurch Borough Council.

Southwestern Front (RSFSR)

The Southwestern Front () was a front of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and the Polish-Soviet War, which existed between January 10, 1920 and December 5, 1920. Before January 1920, it was named the Southern Front. 
Operations.
In January-February 1920, the Front forces, pursuing the retreating White forces of Denikin, successfully conducted the Odessa operation and occupied Odessa on February 7. By March 1 the Front reached the line Mozyr-Ovruch-Korosten-Letichev-Dniester River, but attempts to seize the Crimea, defended by the White Army under the command of General Yakov Slashchov, ended unsuccessfully. 
Then the Front troops acted on two strategic directions : the Western against Poland, and the Crimean against the Army of Wrangel. In April-May 1920, countering the advancing Polish troops, they left Mozyr, Ovruch, Korosten, Kiev and moved to the left bank of the Dnieper. In May and June, they launched a counteroffensive and successfully conducted the Kiev operation, after which they continued their pursuit of the enemy in the zone from Polesia to the Dniester. in June-July, during the Novohrad-Volynskyi and Rivne operations, the Front troops defeated the Polish and reached the approaches to Lublin and Lvov, but they could not seize Lvov and in August 1920 they were forced to retreat. 
The troops of the Front also fought the armed detachments of Bulak-Balakhovich, Petlyura and Boris Savinkov. On October 18, after the conclusion of the Truce with Poland, the Front's operations were stopped and the troops withdrew behind the state border. 
On the Crimean front, in June-July, under the pressure of Wrangel's army the Front forces withdrew to the right bank of the Dnieper and conducted defensive battles on the Kherson-Nikopol-Tokmak-Berdyansk line. In August, they launched an offensive and occupied the Kakhovka bridgehead.&lt;br&gt; 
In September, the enemy succeeded in pushing back the troops of the left wing of the 13th Army, and in occupying Alexandrovsk, Orekhov and Sinelnikovo, creating a threat to the Donbas Region. In September 1920, the Crimean section of the South-Western Front was separated into an independent Southern Front (2nd formation). 
The Front was disbanded on December 5, 1920 and the Front Administration merged with the Administration of the Kiev Military District, to which all the front troops became subordinated.

Phyllis and Aristotle

The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle is a medieval cautionary tale about the triumph of a seductive woman, Phyllis, over the greatest male intellect, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. It is one of several Power of Women stories from that time. Among early versions is the French Lai d'Aristote from 1220.
The story of the dominatrix and the famous intellectual was taken up by artists from the 12th century onwards, in media from stone sculpture in churches to panels of wood or ivory, textiles such as carpets and tapestries, engravings, oil paintings, brass jugs (aquamanile), and stained glass. Artists attracted to the theme include Hans Baldung, Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, and Alessandro Turchi.
Story.
The tale varies in the telling, but the core of it is as follows: Aristotle advises his pupil Alexander to avoid Phyllis, the seductive mistress of his father, the king, but is himself captivated by her. She agrees to ride him, on condition that she play the role of dominatrix. Phyllis has secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnesses Phyllis proving that a woman's charms can overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Phyllis is also described as Alexander's mistress or possibly wife, rather than his father's.
Origins.
The story is said by the Louvre to derive from the German work by Jacques de Vitry in the 13th century. The French work "Le " (The Lay of Aristotle) is known from manuscripts dating from as early as 1220, attributed by scholars to either Henri d'Andeli or .
In 1386, the English poet John Gower included a summary of the tale in his "Confessio Amantis" (in English, unlike his other major works), a collection of stories of immoral love told in verse. It appears in the poem on Apollonius of Tyre (Book 8, 271–2018), where Gower quips that the philosopher's logic and syllogisms do not save him:
Also in the 14th century, the Dominican John Herold wrote a Latin version of the story.
In the 15th century, it was featured in the German comedy "Ain Spil van Maister Aristotiles" (A play of Master Aristotle).
Illustrations.
Medieval.
The cautionary tale of the dominatrix who made a fool of the famous philosopher became popular across medieval Europe. Medieval sculptors in Maasland created aquamanile, jugs in the forms of scenes with human or other figures, depicting Phyllis and Aristotle. The story was depicted in a variety of media including stone, ivory, brass, carpet, tapestry, and engravings.
Early Modern to Enlightenment.
Artists such as Hans Baldung, Albrecht Dürer, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Bartholomeus Spranger and Jan Sadeler continued to exploit the theme, eventually with Phyllis entirely naked. Alessandro Turchi called the woman Campaspe, the mistress of Alexander. The media used include engraving, stained glass, wood, and oil painting.
Nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
Artists such as Julio Ruelas continued to adapt the Phyllis and Aristotle theme.
Oscar Kokoschka produced a version in 1913.

Taiyō no Uta (song)

 is a song recorded by Japanese actress and singer Erika Sawajiri for the TBS television adaptation of the film by the same name, "Taiyō no Uta". It was released under the name Kaoru Amane, the lead character of the series portrayed by Sawajiri, through Sony Music Records on August 30, 2006. The single broke several records, scoring the best first-week sales of a debut single by a female solo artist, and becoming the first debut single by an actress in twelve years to top the Oricon Singles Chart, since Yuki Uchida's debut with "Tenca o Torō! (Uchida no Yabō)" (1994).
Background.
"Taiyō no Uta" was written by Japanese singer-songwriter and daughter of Emiko Shiratori, Maika Shiratori. The song was arranged by Junji Yayoshi and produced by Yoshio Konno. It is composed in the key of G major and set to a tempo of 84 beats per minute. Sawajiri's vocals span from G3 to C5. Lyrically, the song describes a woman who gains hope for the future through falling in love. Shiratori used the plot of the series as inspiration for the lyrics. In 2007, she self-covered the song for her fourth studio album "Hikousen".
Chart performance.
"Taiyō no Uta" debuted at number 2 on the Oricon Singles Chart with 150,000 copies sold, held out of the top spot by GYM's "Fever to Future". The song broke and updated several records upon its release. It recorded the best first-week sales of a debut single by a female solo artist ever, breaking Yuki Uchida's record of 131,000 copies, and became the first debut single by an actress to reach the top three in over nine years, since Ryōko Hirosue with the double A-side single "Maji de Koisuru Gobyō Mae" / "Tomadoi" (1997), which also debuted at number 2. It also marked the first top three entry by a female solo artist credited under the name of a fictional character in just shy of six years, since Miho Kanno debuted at number 3 as Shuka Hasui (蓮井朱夏) with the song "Zoo (Ai o Kudasai)".
"Taiyō no Uta" reached the top of the Oricon Singles Chart on its second week, becoming the first debut single by an actress in over eleven years, since Uchida's "Tenca o Torō! (Uchida no Yabō)", to reach the number-one position. It also became the first debut single by an actress to chart in the top three for two consecutive weeks in over sixteen years, since Rie Miyazawa's "Dream Rush" (1989). Finally, it became the first single released under the pseudonym of a fictional character, since Yui Asaka, Yuka Onishi and Yuma Nakamura's joint release as the Kazama Sisters from the "Sukeban Deka III" series, "Remember" (1987), to top the Oricon Singles Chart in close to nineteen years, as well as the second single overall to achieve the feat.
On its third week, "Taiyō no Uta" slid back down to number 2, dethroned by Glay's "Natsuoto" / "Hen na Yume (Thousand Dreams)", and became the first debut single by a female solo artist to chart in the top three for three consecutive weeks. The following week, the single regained the top spot, marking the first time a single had topped the Oricon Singles Chart for a second time after its first peak in over sixteen years, since the Japanese band Tama's single "Sayonara Jinrui" / "Ranchiu" and becoming only the second debut single by a female solo artist to do so, other than Akiko Kobayashi's "Koi ni Ochite (Fall in Love)" (1985). The single went on to spend three more weeks in the top ten, before falling out of the top twenty two weeks later.
"Taiyō no Uta" charted for twenty-four weeks on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling a reported total of 489,000 copies during its run. The single ranked at number 10 on the year-end chart and was the best-selling single by a female artist of 2006.

The Brown-Chenault House, also known as Campbell Farm, is a historic house in Castalian Springs, Tennessee, U.S.. 
History.
The farmhouse was built as a log house circa 1835 for George T. Brown, his wife and their children. Brown was a farmer who owned 4 slaves in 1838. 
The farm was purchased by David Chenault, the owner of Greenfield, in 1850. Chenault, whose father was a French immigrant, lived on the two properties with his wife, nine sons and four daughters. During the American Civil War of 1861–1865, his son Colby Chenault joined the Confederate States Army and served under General John Hunt Morgan. In 1867, Colby moved into the house, where he lived with his wife, Araminta Harper, and their nine children.

North of the ‘Pota’river is known as Hazuwa and southern part is Simla. The name Hazuwa has some background. The name appears itself because the people are very simple, honest, mild and innocent;as such the name of the place is Hazuwa (Hoza)since the British time. Hazuwa is under the revenue circle of Jalah and it has 78 villages. It is under the district Baksa in BTAD, Assam. The demography of the area is mostly of ST people and other backward classes. The general caste people are very thin. The livelihood of the locality is agriculture. Hardly few people are living on business and other different jobs. The educational background of this area is very backward because of the lack of academic atmosphere. Only few schools and one junior college is the only for the 10 + 2 education to the needy students. For higher education the aspirant students are to move to a long distance. Considering all aspects of the area, the educated people of this area feel very hungrily to have Degree College to pursue higher education to the aspirant students. People gathered and decided to form a Trust to establish a new degree college at Hazuwa. The Trust was registered under society act. The Trust initiated their activities in step wise and finally the college was established at Hazuwa in 2013.

Alpha-Fluoromethylhistidine

α-Fluoromethylhistidine (α-FMH) is an irreversible specific inhibitor of histidine decarboxylase (HDC). It functions by forming a covalent linkage with a catalytic serine residue on the active site of HDC. Due to its efficacy in reducing histamine levels in tissue mast cells, it has many applications in the study of histaminergic systems.
It has potent sleep-inducing effects in mice. In the central nervous systems of rats, α-FMH administration has been shown to cause impairments in long-term memory and learning. Additionally, injection of α-FMH has been shown to increase food intake, although the mechanism is believed to distinct from HDC inhibition, indicating that α-FMH may be involved in the regulation of non-histaminergic systems. A proposed mechanism involves the enhanced expression of neuropeptide Y (NPY) rather than HDC inhibition.
α-FMH has also been shown to target isozymes of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family. Due to the role of GSTs in detoxification, the efficacy of HDC inhibition by α-FMH in humans and its potential for the treatment of pathological conditions is subject to further research.

<doc id="56991000" url="?curid=56991000" title="Höllbachgspreng">
Höllbachgspreng

The Höllbachgspreng is a wooded rock massif below the Großer Falkenstein mountain in the vicinity of Lindberg in the Bavarian Forest, Germany.
Description.
This terrain hollow with extremely steep sides owes its formation to the last ice age. A mountain trail runs through the ancient forest here. Through a narrow, ravine the Höllbach rushes between, gneiss rocks as high as a house in places. On the northern boundary of the region it drops as a waterfall into the depths. The western part of the area is dominated by the Großer Falkenstein.
The slopes are covered with trees such as sycamore, Norway spruce, beech, silver fir and wych elm. The undergrowth includes rare plants like alpine lady-fern, chickweed-wintergreen, sundews, martagon lily and Hungarian gentian. On the rocks grows the very rare sulphur dust lichen ("Schwefelflechte"). As far as birds are concerned the region is relatively species-poor with only 36 types occurring, the course of the stream with its associated draught of cold air being mainly responsible.
Access.
A trail leads through the gorge to the summit of the Großer Falkenstein. The wild and romantic path is only recommended forexperienced and determined hikers because it is very steep, in places crosses the rocks of the stream and fallen trees may have to be negotiated. In any case, sure-footedness and stout footwear are essential. The ascent from the Höllbachschwelle takes about hours.
Nature reserve.
As early as around 1860, nature lovers argued that the region, which was difficult to access, should remain free of forestry activity. As a result, its ancient woodland character has survived. The Höllbachgspreng Nature Reserve ("Naturschutzgebiet Höllbachgspreng") was established by the governments of Lower Bavaria and Upper Palatinate on 17 January 1941 (Reg.Anz. Ausg. 26/28). It has an area of 51.3 ha. Since the expansion of the national park in 1997 it has been part of the Bavarian Forest National Park. Climbing on the rocks of the Höllbachgspreng is forbidden at any time of the year.

Cadouin Abbey

Cadouin Abbey ( or "Abbaye Notre-Dame de la Nativité de Cadouin") was a Cistercian monastery founded as a hermitage in 1115 by Gerald of Salles, in the name of Robert of Arbrissel, in what is now the commune of Le Buisson-de-Cadouin in the Dordogne, south-west France.
In 1119 Cadouin was made an abbey under its first abbot, Henri, a monk of Pontigny Abbey, the second daughter house of Cîteaux Abbey, but seems to have remained independent of the Cistercian Order until around 1199.
Cadouin founded daughter houses of its own (Grandselve Abbey, Gondon Abbey, Bonnevaux Abbey, Ardorel Abbey, La Faise Abbey and Saint-Marcel Abbey) which also became Cistercian, not necessarily at the same time as Cadouin itself.
At an uncertain date the monastery came into possession of what was believed to be the facecloth from the tomb of Christ (), said to have been brought from Antioch by a priest of Périgord. In some traditional accounts the cloth is linked to the Bishop of Le Puy, Adhémar de Monteil, who died in 1098, but it is not documented in the possession of the abbey until 1214. It made Cadouin Abbey an important place of pilgrimage and brought it great prestige and wealth. Cadouin was also only 50 kilometres or so east of the "Via Lemovicensis", one of the four main routes of the Way of Saint James through France. The wars of the 13th and 14th centuries however brought about a dramatic collapse in the number of pilgrimages.
In 1791 the abbey, which by then had only four monks, was dissolved in the French Revolution. Its rich possessions were looted and its library was burnt in the village square.
The abbey church still stands.

Chinese Temple of Dili

The Chinese Temple of Dili is a temple used by the Chinese diaspora of Dili, East Timor. The temple was built in 1928, during the Portuguese control of East Timor, and is still in use today.
The main shrine of the temple is dedicated to Lord Guan, a historical Chinese general from the 3rd century, who is popularly worshipped in Chinese folk religion, Confucianism, and Chinese Buddhism. Another room is dedicated to Guan Yin, a bodhisattva venerated in Chinese folk religion.
History.
In 1926, the Chinese community who migrated from Macau set up a shrine in a garage where they worshipped a 30 cm high statue of Guan Gong that had been sent from China. In 1928, after getting funding from both the Portuguese government and the Chinese diaspora, they built the current temple and enshrined the statue inside the temple. A shrine dedicated to Guan Yin was built in 1977.
The temple survived the Japanese occupation during World War II and the Indonesian occupation without being vandalized.

In the past, Drizella is tempted by Gothel to joining The Coven of Eight, but has to face a test after she pairs up with another prospect, Gretel. The killer is finally revealed.

In the Characters' Past.
In a flashback during the new realm, a young Drizella is playing hide-and-seek with Anastasia, but when Drizella gets lost, Anastasia lights a lantern that leads Drizella to her. Anastasia then says that as long as they're together, they can always find their way home.
Years later, and with Anastasia now lying in a comatose state, Drizella admitted to having cast the new dark curse in order to make her mother suffer. Regina soon joined Drizella to offer help but turned her down, just in time to reveal Regina as Gothel in disguise and tempting her with an offer to join a group of women known as the Coven of Eight. As Drizella accepted the offer, Gothel only had two spots left while going through a recruiting process. Gothel says she's hidden two golden flowers somewhere in the forest and whoever brings her the flowers will prove themselves worthy of joining the Coven. Gothel tells Drizella that she has to do the task alone, but she instead partners up with another recruit named Gretel.
As the two women bond over having to deal with the loss of a sibling, with Gretel revealing how her brother Hansel had changed after the events of dealing with a witch but has never been the same since and has taken on a new identity. Both Drizella and Gretel comes across a fork in the road, the two agreed to separate then meet up. During this separation, Gothel appears to Drizella to reveal that the test was actually an elimination that determines eligibility into the sisterhood. Gothel wants Drizella to kill Gretel with a sai or tekpi type weapon but Drizella decided against it because of Gothel's true intentions. When Gretel returns, Drizella suggest that they form their own sisterhood in order to get what they wanted, but soon that idea is scratched when Gretel reveals the same weapon that Drizella had. It turns out Gothel had set them both up with orders to kill one another. The women soon fight each other but as Gretel was about to kill her Drizella sends her weapon towards Gretel and she kills her instead. Gothel appears to Drizella, telling her that she has been accepted into the Coven of Eight, thus marking the events leading up to the Dark Curse.
In The Present Day.
As Ivy continues her search for Anastasia, she is enticed by Gothel to once again join her Coven, but Ivy turns down Gothel's offers as she wants her sister's powers and she will not sacrifice herself in order to do so. Gothel then hands her a heart shaped box of chocolates which were outside in the lobby (implying that she is the next target), warning her of a serial killer that are after women who have ties to the Coven, but Ivy doesn't believe Gothel's story, that is, until later on that night when the masked Candy Killer goes after Ivy but she escaped his attempts. Ivy then approached Regina for help afterwards. Regina is still upset over what Ivy did to her and Henry but agreed to help. As Regina consulted Weaver on this situation, Ivy is approached by Samdi, who knows about what and why the Candy Killer is after her. Samdi tells Ivy the only way to save both her and Anastasia is using a magic bean that can create a portal, using reinforcement by Anastasia's powers.
Later that evening, Ivy and Anastasia finally meet up, with Ivy ready to forgive Anastasia and promised to help each other get home to their realm with a magic bean. But instead of pulling the bean out of her pocket, she pulled out poppy dust, betraying Anastasia and putting her to sleep. When Ivy takes Anastasia back to Samdi, their attempt to exorcise her powers is interrupted by Gothel, who wakes her up and compels her to kill Ivy. However, Ivy pleads with Anastasia, saying that if she does kill her she would end up giving in to Gothel's control, but Anastasia refuses to kill her sister, much to the dismay of Gothel, who escapes angrily. When Regina and Weaver arrived to see the damage done in the place, they're relieved to see Ivy and Anastasia embraced each other as sisters again. Ivy also apologized to Regina for what she did to Henry and her, with Regina saying she understands. As Ivy and Anastasia say goodbye to Regina and Weaver, Anastasia uses her magic to create the portal, and they go back to their realm.
Back at the bar, Regina confronted Samdi over what happened, but Samdi assures Regina that he was doing this to save Henry by extracting Anastasia's magic into a bottle so Henry will live once his curse is broken but at the same time warns Regina about Weaver's intentions. And as Samdi leaves the bar, Weaver is waiting for him, saying that he's keeping the dagger in his possession, despite Samdi's cautionary message about Weaver's desire to be with Belle.
In between the events, Lucy and Regina come up with a way to perk up Henry while at the same time must keep him and Jacinda from kissing each other, so Regina suggests that Henry get together with Rogers and Nick for a night out (since Hook and Jack were his best friends in the past life). Thanks to Regina texting Rogers and Nick, the guys are able to track Henry to Flynn's Barcade, a local bar that Henry frequents. The two suddenly decided to stick around and help Henry out with his romantic feelings towards Jacinda, giving Nick an idea by making a bet that Henry can move on from Jacinda, by asking out the first woman who walks into the bar, who, as fate would have it, was Jacinda herself.
After the two talk for a while, Jacinda challenge Henry to a game in which he had a coin that if he tossed it into a glass then he would believe in the fairytales that Lucy had told him. When he threw the coin, a bartender takes up the glass and it misses. However, Jacinda doesn't stay long as she has to meet up with Sabine later; surprisingly enough when Jacinda threw a coin into a glass back at home, she succeeded. 
Hours later after the bar closes, Henry, Rogers, and Nick say their goodbyes, with Nick wishing Rogers good luck on the case.
Unbeknownst to Henry and Rogers, after they left Nick alone to fix a flat tire, Nick opens up his car trunk which revealed the heart-shaped boxes, envelopes, objects, and the mask, thus revealing him to be the Candy Killer who has been targeting the coven witches.

Acorn Creek

Acorn Creek is a stream in Carroll County in the U.S. state of Georgia, at an elevation of above mean sea level. It is a tributary to the Chattahoochee River with a discharge rate of 2.74 cfs.
Etymology.
Acorn Creek takes its name from Acorn Town, a Creek Indian settlement and plantation which stood near its mouth. The original Muskogee name for this stream was Lakcv-hache. The plantation was home to Chief McIntosh of the Lower Creek indigenous peoples, and was known by various names: Acorn Town, Acorn Bluff, and Lochau Talofau.
History.
Acorn Creek today is located near the boundary of the McIntosh Reserve, a outdoor recreation area operated by the Carroll County Recreation Department. Carroll County acquired Lochau Talofau and established the Reserve in 1978. The Reserve contains a portion, but not all, of the larger 19th-century plantation of Acorn Bluff. 
The Reserve is named for William McIntosh, a prominent Creek Indian leader and planter who maintained a home and plantation at the site. McIntosh named his plantation "Lochau Talofau," which in English means "Acorn Bluff" (less frequently "Acorn Town") and was one square mile in size, encompassing the lower reaches of Acorn Creek. At Acorn Bluff, McIntosh constructed a simple two-story log house which he used as both a residence and as an inn for travelers. A replica of the house was constructed after the purchase of the Reserve, and is open to park visitors. 
McIntosh and the Lower Creek tribes sided with the United States government (against the British and their Red Stick Creek allies) in the Creek War of 1813-1814. McIntosh distinguished himself in the battles of Autossee and Horseshoe Bend, and was promoted to the rank of Brigadier-General. He again fought beside General Andrew Jackson in the First Seminole War of 1816-1819. A hero to many, McIntosh provoked the wrath of his fellow Creeks when he signed the second Treaty of Indian Springs, in 1825. The treaty essentially sold all Creek lands in Georgia and Alabama to the United States government. McIntosh was allowed to keep his plantation in exchange for signing the treaty. The sale of ancestral lands was opposed by the Creek National Council, which saw the act as both unauthorized and illegal. The Treaty of the Creek Agency (1818), which previously ceded two smaller portions of Creek lands, had moved the Council to propose the execution of McIntosh. While McIntosh survived that earlier confrontation with the Creek National Council, the treaty of 1825 was his undoing. The Council ruled that McIntosh and other signatories had committed a capital offense against the Creek government and people by ceding communal lands, and ordered their execution. McIntosh was murdered at his home, Acorn Bluff, in 1825. McIntosh's grave is located in the McIntosh Reserve, adjacent to his reconstructed home. Georgia Historical Marker 022-3 (1984) marks the location of Brigadier-General McIntosh's home and burial site.
Geology and watershed.
The stream originates just west of the city of Whitesburg, Georgia and empties into the Chattahoochee River in Carroll County. The Acorn Creek-Chattahoochee River watershed has a total area of 28,284 acres. The Acorn Creek-Chattahoochee River watershed is part of the larger Middle Chattahoochee-Lake Harding watershed which has an area of 1,950,182 acres.
In Carroll County, where Acorn Creek flows into the path of the Chattahoochee river, the scar of the Brevard Fault is visible. The fault is a geologic feature that spans several states. From Atlanta to eastern Alabama, an area which includes Acorn Creek, the rock units that characterize the fault outcrop in widths rarely exceeding 600 feet (180 meters) yet extend along strike for 80 miles (128 km). The Chattahoochee, at McIntosh Reserve, becomes a shallow shoal. A guide to that area notes "The rugged landscape is evidence of the Brevard Fault zone, so prominent along [this] section of the river". The fault line is delineated where the banks of the Chattahoochee are "studded with huge boulders [which] rise 80 feet above the river". Within a few miles, downstream of Acorn Creek, the Brevard Fault leaves the Chattahoochee River and "continues in a south-westerly direction into Alabama". 
McIntosh Reserve Park was closed for several months in 2009 and 2010, following the September 2009 flooding along the Chattahoochee River corridor and Acorn Creek. The park reopened Memorial Day weekend, 2010.
Environmental assessment.
An environmental assessment of the creek, performed in 1987-88 by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources - Environmental Protection Division (EPD) concluded that summer fecal coliform levels from both point and nonpoint pollution sources were within total maximum daily load target levels and no additional reductions were required. 
The stream is a popular fishing location. One online fishing site lists Shoal bass as the most popular species of fish caught in Acorn Creek.

Peter Schmidt (zoologist)

Peter Yulievich Schmidt (born 23 December 1872, St. Petersburg, died 25 November 1949, Leningrad) was a Russian and Soviet zoologist, ichthyologist and museum curator.
Peter Yulievich Schmidt attended the gymnasium of KI May before studying at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of St. Petersburg University, from where he graduated in 1895. He was engaged in the laboratory of Professor V.M. Shimkevich and V.T. Shevyakov. He travelled through Semirechiy in 1899-1902. In 1908-1910 he participated in the Kamchatka expedition of F. P. Ryabushinsky, where he headed the zoological department. In 1906, he was awarded with a gold medal named after Petr Petrovich Semyonov by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society.
In 1906-1930 he held the position of a professor at the Agricultural Institute in St. Petersburg (Leningrad) and from 1914-1931 he worked at the Zoological Museum of the Russian Academy of Sciences. From 1930-1949 Schmidt was a scientific secretary to the Pacific Committee of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
In 1938 he was arrested. along with a group of other employees of the Zoological Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, by the NKVD because they had non-Russian surnames. Schmidt was suspected of espionage for Germany and Japan on the grounds that he had been on scientific missions in Berlin and Tokyo. After interrogation, during which the 66-year-old professor was knocked out, he signed the protocol as required by the NKVD investigators and also confessed to being an Italian spy, as his daughter lived in Italy. Eventually he was released and was able to continue his scientific activity.
Until 1900 the main scientific interests of Schmidt were in arachnology, the morphology of the inferior millipedes and the invertebrate fauna of Semirechiye. Even while he was at university, he received a gold medal for a study of millipedes a gold medal. His best known work came after 1900 when he began to study the fish fauna of the Pacific and Ichthyology in its broader sense. Schmidt was the first zoologist to observe the anabiosis in desiccated earthworms. He translated scientific literature from German into Russian and was the editor of the Russian "Small Biological Encyclopedia".
The colubrid snake "Dolichophis schmidti", the salmonid "Salvelinus schmidti", the cod species "Lepidion schmidti", the Northern smoothtongue "Leuroglossus schmidti" , the eelpout "Lycogrammoides schmidti", the lumpfish "Eumicrotremus schmidti", the amphipod "Anisogammarus schmidti", and a range of mountains on the island of Urup in the Kurile Islands are all named in honour of Schmidt.

ZCCHC18

Zinc finger CCHC-type containing 18 (ZCCHC18) is a protein that in humans is encoded by "ZCCHC18" gene. It is also known as Smad-interacting zinc finger protein 2 (SIZN2), para-neoplastic Ma antigen family member 7b (PNMA7B), and LOC644353. Other names such as zinc finger, CCHC domain containing 12 pseudogene 1, P0CG32, ZCC18_HUMAN had been used to describe this protein.
ZCCHC18 belongs to the ZCCHC12 family or para-neoplastic Ma (PNMA). It is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor transcription coactivator. Its zinc finger domain is CCHC which binds to zinc ion (see protein section for detail information on CCHC motif).
It is worthwhile to mention that in mammals, PNMA is derived from Ty3/Gypsy long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons and PNMA family encodes the Gag-like protein. Although the full functions remain unknown, most PNMA genes are expressed in brains of macaques and mice. PNMA1, 2 and 3 were found in the serum of patients with paraneoplastic neurological disorders. The family also includes modulator of apoptosis 1, having a role in death receptor-dependent apoptosis.
Gene.
Location.
ZCCHC18 gene locates at the long arm of X chromosome, loci position Xq22.2. This gene contains 3 exons and 2 distinct gt-ag introns, being transcribed into 3 alternatively spliced mRNAs. However, only one spliced mRNA (NM_001143978.2, 2951 bp) putatively encodes a 403 amino acid protein, whereas the others does not encode proteins.
Gene Neighborhood.
Nearby genes include "SLC25A53" (on the negative strand) (about 8,000 bit/s upstream) and "FAM199X" (on the positive strand) (about 50,800 bit/s downstream).
Expression.
"ZCCHC18" ubiquitously expresses in ovary, brain (cerebellum), endometrium, lymph node, spleen and 22 other tissues in human and other species. Based on RNA-Seq expression data from GTEx (53 tissues from 570 donors), highest median expression is in brain—cerebellum (4.74 RPKM) whereas the total median expression of 67.54 RPKM.
Promoter.
Possible transcription binding sites is analyzed by Genomatix, listed in the table below: 
Homology.
Orthologs.
Orthologs of ZCCHC18 can be found in most Chordata (Mammalia, Amphibian, Reptilian, Osteichthyes, but not in Arthropod, Aves, Chondrichthyes), Echinoderm, and Cnidarian but not in Fungus, Plant, Ciliates, Archaea, nor Bacteria.
Paralogs.
Eight possible paralogs of ZCCHC18 were identified in "Homo sapiens".
Note: PNMA4 (aliases: modulator of apoptosis 1, MOAP1) does not appear to be similar to ZCCHC18 (the identity and similarity between ZCCHC18 and MOAP1 are 15% and 32.1%, respectively).
Transcript.
Splice Variants.
Including 5’-UTR and 3’-UTR, ZCCHC18 spans from chrX:104,112,526-104,115,846 with a total of 3,321 base pairs (bps) (5’-UTR: 1206 bit/s and 3’-UTR: 523 bit/s). It contains 3 exons and 2 distinct gt-ag introns, being transcribed into 3 alternatively spliced mRNAs. However, only one spliced mRNA (NM_001143978.2, 2951 bit/s) putatively encodes a protein with 403 amino acids (coding region: hg38 chrX:104,114,112-104,115,323, total 1,212 bit/s), whereas others do not encode proteins.
Comparing to human ZCCHC18 mRNA which there are 3 isoforms, there are 7 isoforms of Zcchc18 in mouse ("Mus musculus"), and no isoform in cat ("Felis catus") and leopard ("Panthera pardus").
Protein.
ZCCHC18 is a human protein with 403 amino acids in length and has a predicted molecular weight of 45,160 daltons. Its basal isoelectric point is 7.02 (unphosphorylated state), and isoelectric point decreased with increased number of residues being phosphorylated. The common sequences of ZCCHC18 include KRED and LVIFM. It is generally electroneutral (there are no positive or negative charge clusters or segments) with no high hydrophobic segments.
Secondary Structure.
Secondary structure prediction of a not well-characterized protein can be performed by using PRBI database, Phyre2, and I-TASSER. The secondary structure prediction of ZCCHC18 was analyzed by Phyre2.
Tertiary Structure.
The tertiary structure was predicted by I-TASSER in the attempt to optimize C-score, TM-score, and cluster density. The predicted ZCCHC18 tertiary structure is shown in the figure..
Post-Translational Modifications.
The predicted post-translational modifications (PTMs) is obtained by using Prosite, and many other tools. The key post translation modifications are summarized here.
Subcellular Localization.
ZCCHC18 primary locates in the nucleus (appearance to be nuclear speck, a discrete extra-nucleolar subnuclear domain, under immunofluorescence microscopy).
Function.
Although the exact function of ZCCHC18 is still not fully known, the basic amino acid sequence of the zinc finger (Znf) CCHC-type protein can be well characterized as conservatively spaced cysteine and histidine. The Cys and His residues is completely conserved at position 1 (Cys), 4 (Cys), 9 (His), and 14 (Cys) [as the first Cys of the sequence labeled as Cys (1)]. Conservatively substituted glycines occur at position 5 and 8, and aromatic or hydrophobic amino acids are at positions 2 (or 3) and 10. This motif is often expressed as Cys-X2-Cys-X4-His-X4-Cys.
The structure of zinc finger domains enables the protein to make tandem contact with target molecules through multiple finger-like protrusions. These domains can bind to zinc or other metals such as iron, or even no metal (stabilizing through salt bridges). The exact mechanism for how the Znf domain of ZCCHC18 work is still unknown.
Interacting Proteins.
ZCCHC18 can possibly interact with the intracellular domain of EGFR. This report was based on the two protein-protein interaction (PPI) approaches, the membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) and the mammalian membrane two-hybrid (MMTH), to map the PPIs between human receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and phosphatases.
Clinical Significance.
Disease Association.
By examining RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), glioma has enhanced RNA expression (median 1.9 FPKM [Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million reads]) whereas other cancer types only have minimal expression (median expression level lower than 0.5 FPKM). In terms of the ZCCHC18 protein expression, squamous and basal cell carcinomas, and cases of urothelial cancers exhibited moderate to strong cytoplasmic immunoreactivity. Remaining cancer cells were weakly stained or negative. While interrogating 4440 tumor samples from 15 cancer types from TCGA, the analysis showed a vary protein mutation frequency in different cancer types. ZCCHC18 mutation happened frequently in endometrial cancer (~ 2.4%), followed by bladder cancer (~0.8%), head/neck carcinoma (~0.4%), ovarian cancer (~0.4%), and breast cancer (&lt;0.2%).
Genetic Testing.
As of May 2021, Fulgent Genetics was the only commercial company that provided the genetic testing for deletion or duplication of ZCCHC18 through sequence analysis of the entire coding region (Next-Generation Sequencing) for possible diseases caused by mutations on this particular gene that are inherited from a parent's genome. However, the clinical validity and utility have not been proven yet.

Caroona Creek Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the localities of Collinsville and Mount Bryan East about north-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about east of the town of Hallett.
It came into existence on 18 February 2010 by proclamation under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972". Its name which is derived from the Caroona Creek, a stream flowing within its boundaries, was approved by the Surveyor General of South Australia on 14 June 2005. Additional land was added to the conservation park on 16 October 2014. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
A separate proclamation on 18 February 2010 ensured the continuation of “existing rights of entry, prospecting, exploration or mining” regarding the land under the "Mining Act 1971" and the "Petroleum and Geothermal Energy Act 2000".
The conservation park consisted of the following land in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Tomkinson at proclamation in 2010: 
Land added in 2014 consisted of sections 53, 54 and 55 in the Hundred of Tomkinson, and sections 56, 191 and 538 in the Hundred of Hallett.
The Heysen Trail, the long distance walking trail, passes through the conservation park as a loop entering from the south and exiting in the west.
In 2011, it was described by its managing authority as follows:Situated on the western edge of the Olary Plain, this park contains a range of landforms from steep rocky ridges and calcrete hills extending to alluvial plains. The park conserves a representative sample of the transitional zone between the rounded hills of the Mid North to the beginning of the rocky gorge country of the Flinders Ranges. The northern area contains the beautiful Tourilie Gorge and its surrounding rugged hilly terrain.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area.

Beniapukur

Beniapukur is a neighbourhood of Central Kolkata in Kolkata district in the Indian state of West Bengal. It is adjacent to Park Circus.
Etymology.
The name of the neighbourhood is derived from two words, "benia" and "pukur". Influential "benias" or merchants, particularly "gandhabaniks", perfume and spice traders, settled here. They had dug a tank or "pukur" in the area.
History.
The East India Company obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. The remaining 33 villages were on the Calcutta side. After the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, it purchased these villages in 1758 from Mir Jafar and reorganised them. These villages were known en-bloc as "Dihi Panchannagram" and Beniapukur was one of them.
The Maratha Ditch was dug in 1742 and it was partly filled up in 1799 to create the Circular Road (now Acharya Jagaidsh Chandra Bose Road).
Entally, Maniktala, Beliaghata, Ultadanga, Chitpur, Cossipore, parts of Beniapukur, Ballyganj, Watganj and Ekbalpur, and parts of Garden Reach and Tollygunj were added to Kolkata Municipal Corporation in 1888. Garden Reach was later taken out.
In 1888, one of the 25 newly organized police section houses was located in Beniapukur, which is mentioned from the mid-eighteenth century, but the "thana" dates from the early 19th century.

Yue Zhongqi

Yue Zhongqi (岳鍾琪, 1686 – 1754) was a Chinese military commander of the Qing dynasty. He was a descendant of Yue Fei, and served as Ministry of War and Viceroy of Chuan-Shaan during the reign of the Yongzheng Emperor.
Yue succeeded Nian Gengyao as Viceroy of Chuan-Shaan from 1725 to 1732. Zeng Jing, a "xiucai" in Hunan, sent his student Zhang Xi (張熙) to Xi'an in 1728, attempted to incite Yue to organize a plot to overthrow the Manchu-led Qing dynasty. Yue refused him and exposed his plot. Yue was commended by Yongzheng Emperor; Zeng Jing was easily caught and transported to Beijing.
Qing Han Chinese general Yue Zhongqi interviewed the Tibetan collaborator with the Qing, Polhané Sönam Topgyé (P'o-lha-nas) concerning his involvement in crushing the Tibetan rebels and sent a report to the Qing Yongzheng emperor on 17 August 1728.
Yue also participated in Dzungar–Qing Wars. He conquered Tibet and seized Lhasa with the 2,000 Green Standard soldiers and 1,000 Manchu soldiers of the "Sichuan route" in 1720. He was accused of "arrogancy and unlawful act" (驕蹇不法) by Jalangga (查郎阿) and was stripped of official position in 1733. He didn't return to politics until 1748. He participated in Jinchuan campaigns, and later put down the rebellion of Gyurme Namgyal together with Ts'ereng (策楞).

Niuma Mohamed

Niuma Mohamed (pronounced ; 20 October 1977) is a Maldivian film actress, director, and producer. The highest-paid actress in Maldives, Mohamed is the recipient of several awards, including two Gaumee Film Awards, and four Maldives Film Awards. She holds the record for collecting all three Maldives Film Awards for Best Actress in a feature film. In 2011, the Government of Maldives honoured her with the National Award of Recognition.
Mohamed was born in Vaadhoo and raised in Male'. After completing eight years of standard education, she dropped out of school and joined a taxi centre where a customer, a producer of Television Maldives, offered her to make her career debut with the drama series "Hithi Thajuribaa" (1994). Despite some criticism, she soon received several offers and starred in the horror film "Fathis Handhuvaru" (1997), which proved to be a breakthrough for her. She went on to act in several more horror films, including "Zalzalaa" (2000), "Ginihila" (2003), "Dhonkamana" (2003), "Sandhuravirey 2" (2004), and "Handhu Keytha" (2005). Mohamed received her first Gaumee Film Award for Best Actress in 2007 with her portrayal of the tolerant second wife in "Kalaayaanulaa" (2003).
She was later noted for her portrayal of a devoted wife in "Hiyani" (2006), a schoolteacher in Fathimath Nahula's highest-grossing film, "Yoosuf" (2008), and in "Hiyy Rohvaanulaa" (2008), all of which resulted in Gaumee Film Award nominations. She established herself as the most prominent leading actress of Maldivian cinema in 2010 with the film "Niuma", which also marked her directorial debut. She was bestowed with her second Gaumee Film Award for Best Actress along with a nomination as Best Director for this production; she won both the awards at 2nd Maldives Film Awards. Mohamed's success continued with the family dramas "Maafeh Neiy" (2010), "Sazaa" (2011), "Mihashin Furaana Dhandhen" (2012), "Dhilakani" (2013), and "Aadheys" (2014).

Mohamed was born on 20 October 1977 in GDh. Vaadhoo, the youngest of six siblings. A die-hard fan of Amitabh Bachchan, Rekha, Aamir Khan, and Kajol, she frequently listened to Voice of Maldives and watched Bollywood films, which inspired her to become an actress.
Mohamed attended Maafannu Madharusa school and she calls her experience there a "joyous ride". She completed eight standard school years with no intention of studying further. In 1993, she worked in the Villingili government as her first job. The next year, she joined a taxi centre and four months later, she received a call from Mariyam Shauqee, a producer for Television Maldives, praising her voice and offering to cast Mohamed in one of her films. At the age of seventeen, the young actress made her career debut in Shaugee's television drama series "Hithi Thajuribaa" (1994) alongside Ali Shameel, Aminath Rasheedha, and Arifa Ibrahim.

Featuring Hassan, Yoosuf Shafeeu, Sheela Najeeb, Sheereen Abdul Wahid, Amira Ismail, and Aminath Rasheedha, the film received mainly negative reviews from critics, though its inclusion of the theme portraying the relationship between a couple with a large age gap was praised.
Mohamed was later applauded for her performance as Faraha, an empowered, wealthy business woman who makes it her life's mission to break up a happy marriage in the Abdul Faththaah-directed critically acclaimed television series "Thiyey Mihithuge Vindhakee" (2003).
Mohamed's most successful release of the year 2003 was Fathimath Nahula's romantic film "Kalaayaanulaa", which tells the story of a man (Yoosuf Shafeeu) who decides to marry his childhood best friend (played by Mohamed) when his wife (Aishath Shiranee) fails to please him sexually. The film received widespread critical acclaim for its performances and was declared the year's highest-grossing Maldivian film. Mohamed's portrayal of the tolerant second wife garnered her a Miadhu Crystal Award for Best Actress and a Gaumee Film Award for Best Actress.
This was followed by Abdul Faththaah's "Aan... Aharenves Loabivin" (2002), starring Mohamed, alongside Ali Seezan, Sheela Najeeb, Aminath Rasheedha, and Neena Saleem. Mohamed played the role of Suzy, an ill-fated girl who is forced to conceal her marriage in order to help her friend recovering from amnesia.

In 2005, Mohamed starred alongside Ali Seezan and Sheereen Abdul Wahid in Ahmed Nimal's horror film "Handhu Keytha" (2005), which tells the story of a man who is enchanted by a spirit while witnessing a lunar eclipse.
Mohamed then stepped into Fathimath Nahula's critically and commercially successful romantic drama television series "Kalaage Haqqugaa", to play the role of Aishath Imna, a sacrificing mother and an orphan who is later abandoned by her guardian.
Mohamed rose to widespread prominence in the television industry with her performance as an indolent daughter who marries her best friend in the Arifa Ibrahim-directed critically acclaimed television series "Vairoalhi Ahves Sirrun" in 2005. The story revolves around two best friends involved in extramarital affairs who fail to perform their duties as husband and wife. The show, which also included Lufshan Shakeeb, Ahmed Asim, Aminath Rasheedha, and Mariyam Shakeela, was listed as one of the most successful television series.
2006–09: Critical and commercial success.
In April 2006, Ahmed Nimal's revenge thriller "Hiyani" was released, featuring Mohamed as a devoted wife who seeks comfort in the company of her husband's kidnapper. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics. Mohamed's performance fetched her another Gaumee Film Award nomination for Best Actress. This was followed by Amjad Ibrahim's romantic drama film "Hithuge Edhun" (2006), which tells the story of a disabled man, with Mohamed playing the role of Shaniya, the man's caring wife who hides the truth of her first marriage. This resulted in another Gaumee Film Award nomination for Best Actress. The same year, Mohamed again collaborated with the team from "Vairoalhi Ahves Sirrun", in Arifa Ibrahim's new romantic television drama series "Vaguthu Faaithu Nuvanees". The series, which follows the story of two best friends who both love the same person, features Mohamed in the role of one of the friends, who pursues her revenge for the betrayal she feels she has experienced.
In 2008, Mohamed appeared in Fathimath Nahula's romantic drama film "Yoosuf", which depicts the story of a deaf-mute man (played by Yoosuf Shafeeu) who has been mistreated and mocked by a wealthy family for his disability. The film featured an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Sheela Najeeb, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Nimal, Fauziyya Hassan, Ravee Farooq, Zeenath Abbas, and Ahmed Lais Asim, who were at the time the biggest names in Maldivian cinema. Mohamed played the wife of the titular character and regarded her role to be one of the most challenging she had taken on throughout her career, since most of her dialogue needed to be "audible and expressive in gestures". The film received widespread critical acclaim and attained blockbuster status at the box office, making it one of the all-time highest-grossing movies in the Maldives. It was also the Maldivian official entry at the 2009 SAARC Film Festival and had the privilege of being the festival's opening feature. Mohamed's performance earned her a Gaumee Film Awards nomination for Best Actress, and she won a Maldives Film Award in the same category.
Mohamed had four releases in 2009. Her first film of the year was Yoosuf Shafeeu's "Hiyy Rohvaanulaa", where she featured alongside Shafeeu, Abdulla Muaz, and Nadhiya Hassan. The film follows a blind man who regains his eyesight but decides to conceal this and continue presenting as blind in order to discover his wife's affair with another man. Mohamed played the role of Zeeshan, a schoolteacher trapped in her previous relationship with a ruthless man. The film received favorable reviews from critics and was a commercial success. For her performance in the film, Mohamed received a nominations for Best Actress at the 6th Gaumee Film Awards and the 1st Maldives Film Awards ceremony.
The same year, the actress played a naive woman who is brutally raped by her brother-in-law, in Ahmed Nimal's drama "E Dharifulhu", which featured an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Mohamed Manik, Sheela Najeeb, and Ahmed Nimal. At the 1st Maldives Film Awards, Mohamed received her third nomination as Best Actress for her performance in the film. She next appeared in Ali Shifau's suspense thriller "Happy Birthday", which narrates the story of a simple man who receives a call on his birthday informing him that his wife and son have been kidnapped for ransom. Mohamed played the role of Suza, the man's wife. The film was a commercial failure, despite a positive response from critics. It won five Gaumee Film Awards and twelve Maldives Film Awards and was also screened at the Venice Film Festival. In her last release of the year, Mohamed starred opposite Ali Seezan and Nadhiya Hassan in Seezan's melodrama "Karuna Vee Beyvafa". The film follows a happily married couple who learn that the wife cannot bear children, and the collapse of their relationship following this.
2010–13: "Niuma" and further success.
Mohamed's first release of 2010 was Ali Seezan's family drama "Maafeh Neiy", where she appeared alongside Seezan and Koyya Hassan Manik. The film highlights many social issues including human rights abuses, forced marriage, and domestic violence. Mohamed playes the role of Seema, a woman who has been ill-treated by her two daughters. The film was criticised for its melodrama, though critics found Mohamed to be the "saving grace of the film". Other critics expressed disappointment to "witness a middling acting [from] the all-time best actress". The film fetched her a nomination for Best Actress at the 2nd Maldives Film Awards. In her next release of the year, a family drama by Ali Shifau, "Dhin Veynuge Hithaamaigaa", Mohamed featured in dual roles—as Nisha, an aspiring model who has been tormented by tempestuous in-laws, and as Aminath, a woman who dies during childbirth. The film and her performance received positive responses from critics.
Mohamed next starred opposite Yoosuf Shafeeu, Sheela Najeeb, and Mohamed Manik in Ahmed Nimal's horror film "Zalzalaa En'buri Aun". It was a spin-off of Aslam Rasheed's horror classic "Zalzalaa" (2000). The film revolves around a mariage blanc, the murder of a man by his wife, and the avenging of his death. Mohamed played the role of a spirit who falls in love with the lead character and later seeks vengeance for his murder. The film received mixed responses from critics and had a mediocre performance at the box office. Later in 2010, Mohamed appeared alongside Yoosuf Shafeeu and Amira Ismail in "Veeraana", a drama film that deals with child sexual abuse. She played the role of Reena, a woman who dies during childbirth. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics, who praised the writer and director for tackling a sensitive topic but criticized the "over-the-top melodrama". The production proved to be a commercial success, however. Mohamed next reunited with Ahmed Nimal in his horror film "The Three", which received negative reviews from critics and was declared to be a box office disaster. She also appeared in Amjad Ibrahim's romantic horror film "Vakinuvinama", which was another critical and commercial failure.
The actress followed this with her directorial debut, the drama "Niuma", which featured her in the titular role, alongside an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Sheela Najeeb, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Nimal, Aminath Rasheedha, and Abdulla Muaz. The project made Mohamed the highest-paid actress in the history of Maldivian cinema. In an interview, she stated, "I sacrificed my hair to make a scene audiences will be thrilled to watch. I assure everyone that, if this film is not appreciated, I will leave the industry once and for all". Upon release, the film was met with widespread critical acclaim, specifically complimenting the performance and dialogue. Ahmed Naif from "Sun" wrote: "Niuma's acting is the best I have seen from a Maldivian film. In the scene where Nimal cuts her hair, she brought the perfect expression and emotions to it, nobody else could have justified the role as she did". The film went on to become the highest-grossing Maldivian release of the year and fetched Mohamed several accolades, including Best Director and Best Actress awards at the 2nd Maldives Film Awards. She also won the Best Actress award at the 6th Gaumee Film Awards ceremony, while being nominated for Best Director.
Mohamed began 2011 with Hussain Munawwar's directorial debut, "Sazaa", opposite Ismail Rasheed and Lufshan Shakeeb. The story revolves around a carefree woman whose life it turned upside down when she is forced to marry a brutal man. Mohamed earned mostly positive comments for her performance as the lead character. Critically well received, the film emerged as a commercial success. Mohamed's performance fetched her a Best Actress nomination at the 7th Gaumee Film Awards. She followed this success by appearing in Ali Shifau's psychological romantic thriller "Zaharu", alongside Ali Seezan and Sheela Najeeb. The film centers around a married man who has a brief affair with a woman who becomes obsessed with him. Mohamed played the role of Aminath, a woman who finds out about her husband's extramarital affair. The film was inspired by the Adrian Lyne-directed American erotic thriller "Fatal Attraction" (1987). Upon release, "Zaharu" received mixed responses from critics and was declared a flop at the box office. Apart from featuring in an item number in Hamid Ali's "Laelaa", Mohamed went on to star alongside Aishath Rishmy, Ali Seezan, Ahmed Azmeel, and Aminath Rasheedha in Azmeel's debut, "Hiyy Yaara Dheefa". The film received negative reviews from critics, pointing out similarities between the Bollywood comedy-drama film "Ishq" (1997) and Kundan Shah's family drama "Dil Hai Tumhaara" (2002). Mohamed played Anju, an adopted daughter craving love. The film did not succeed financially, but her portrayal was moderately acclaimed by critics.
In 2012, the actress played a physiotherapist in Ravee Farooq romantic drama film "Mihashin Furaana Dhandhen", opposite Mohamed Manik and Ali Seezan. Upon release, the film received mixed responses from critics, while Mohamed's performance was reviewed positively. Ahmed Nadheem of "Haveeru" noted the film as "the best Maldivian melodramatic film" he had seen in the past two years, though he was displeased with its similarities to two Bollywood films. Mohamed's portrayal of Saara in the film resulted in another Gaumee Film Award nomination for Best Actress. The following year, she again collaborated with Munawwar for his second production, the revenge thriller film "Dhilakani", along with Ismail Rasheed, Mohamed Manik, Mohamed Faisal, and Aminath Rishfa. The film deals with a man's tumultuous journey to seek vengeance and the demolition of a family bond over a girl. Mohamed played the love interest of three siblings. The film attracted negative reviews from critics: Nadheem wrote, "Embraced with futile characters, impractical scenes and outdated music, the film has problems in each department. Munawwar failed to extract the talent of actors like [Niuma Mohamed], who is the most accomplished actress in the industry". Mohamed was bestowed with the Best Actress award at the 3rd Maldives Film Awards.
2014–present: Professional expansion.
Mohamed's first release of 2014 was Mohamed Nimal's family drama "Aniyaa", alongside Ismail Rasheed and Mohamed Jumayyil. The story revolves around a boy who has been deprived of love by his parents. Due to several technical errors and struggles caused during the screening of the film, it failed to garner enough hype, ultimately performing poorly at the box office. It was followed by another family drama, "Aadheys", directed by Abdul Faththaah and starring Hussain Sobah, Amira Ismail, Moosa Zakariyya, Fathimath Azifa, and Ali Azim in pivotal roles. The film tells the story of a sacrificing mother and her affection towards her child. Filming was completed in 2011, though it was released three years later due to the death of producer Hassain Ali. Upon release, the film received mixed reviews from critics and failed to leave an impression commercially. In a review, Ismail Naail wrote: "As expected, Niuma leaves less room for criticism though her character and its portrayal can still be improved". At the 8th Gaumee Film Awards, Mohamed received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress for the two films, respectively.
In 2015, the actress made a special appearance in Ali Seezan's action film "Ahsham", where she played the role of Ali Seezan's wife who dies in a car accident. The film, made on a budget of MVR 1,500,000, was considered as the most expensive film made in the Maldives. It was one of three entries from the Maldives to the SAARC Film Festival in 2016. The following year, Mohamed featured alongside Yoosuf Shafeeu in Ibrahim Wisan's debut, "Vee Beyvafa". The film received negative responses from critics, with Ahmed Adhushan of "Mihaaru" calling it "a step backward" in the progress of cinema.
In 2017, Mohamed made a special appearance in the romantic comedy film "Naughty 40" and also produced the film alongside Ismail Shafeeq. She featured alongside an ensemble cast including Yoosuf Shafeeu, Mohamed Manik, Ahmed Saeed, and Ali Seezan, playing the role of Niufa. The film met with both critical and commercial success, emerging as one of the highest-grossing Maldivian films of 2017. On 20 October 2017, a grand event was held to celebrate Mohamed's twenty-year-long career, at which she presented her upcoming psychological thriller "Nivairoalhi" and announced her retirement from acting.
Released in 2019, the film was produced by Mohamed herself and directed by Moomin Fuad.
Starring opposite Yoosuf Shafeeu and Ahmed Asim, the actress gained weight in preparation for her role and faced major delays in post-production since she was suffering from laryngitis. The film received majorly positive reviews from critics: Aishath Maaha of "Dho?" favored the performance of the lead actors and mentioned the "neat arrangement" of its screenplay, though pointing out its "weak ending". Praising her performance as a patient suffering from depression, Maaha wrote: "On a positive note, this is the most natural acting Niuma has portrayed so far in her career. However, it surely breaks several hearts to realize that we will no longer see such a marvelous performance from her in any film to come". Later that year, the first Maldivian anthology film was released, featuring Mohamed as the helpless wife of a drug dealer in a segment directed by Fuad, titled "Baiveriya". The project was shot in 2013 and digitally released six years later due to several delays in post-production.
Personal life.
Mohamed's first marriage was to Ibrahim Habeeb in 2002. The couple were divorced shortly after, and few years later, Habeeb was found dead, having committed suicide.
In September 2002, Mohamed and actor Ali Seezan were accused of having an extramarital affair after being apprehended while together alone in a locked, darkened room. They were subsequently convicted and publicly flogged. Mohamed was also sentenced to eight months of house arrest while Seezan was sentenced to eight months banishment to an uninhabited island (a form of punishment in the Maldives). Two years later, in 2004, Mohamed and Seezan got married. Similar to her previous marriage, the couple were divorced in the span of a few months.
Mohamed has been diagnosed with vitiligo, which results in white patches on the skin. She went to Sri Lanka for treatment and experienced major improvements. She has spoken of the condition, saying: "I was being told by producers and directors to color-match the pale skin with normal skin with the help of make-up. I accepted their terms during the earlier stages of my condition".
The actress was romantically linked with Hassan Ibrahim while filming a project together, and they were married in 2007. On 21 July 2008, Mohamed gave birth to a daughter, Mariyam Zoya Hassan. After a few years, the couple divorced and Mohamed decided to stay single to take care of her daughter.
In February 2018, she announced her interest to run as a parliament member. In an interview, she stated: "I have always been fond of politics. The knowledge I hold and my ability will be proved once I join politics. In fact, I always get myself involved in political conversations, so I am aware of our political crisis and definitely not new to this environment".
Media image.
Mohamed is considered among the most popular and high-profile celebrities in Maldives. Following the success of "Kalaayaanulaa", "Yoosuf", "Hiyy Rohvaanulaa", and "Niuma", her film roles were subject to wide commercial analysis. In 2010, Niuma was cited as the most successful leading actress and highest-paid actress in the Maldives. She has endorsed several brands and products throughout her career. In 2012, she was ranked second in the list of "Best Actresses in Maldives", compiled by "Haveeru". The following year, she was voted in the top three as the "Most Entertaining Actress" in the SunFM Awards 2010, an award ceremony launched by Sun Media Group to honour the most recognized personalities in different fields from the previous year. In 2018, Mohamed was ranked first on "Dho?"'s list of Top Ten Actresses of Maldives, with writer Aishath Maaha opining that Mohamed has "achieved every possible success anyone can get from this small industry".

Biography.
Early life and scientific activity.
Khudoyor Yusufbekovich Yusufbekov was born on December 10, 1928 in Pish, a village in Darmorakht subdistrict of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region (GBAO) in the Tajik ASSR, USSR in the family of a kolkhoz member-gardener. He was 10 years old when his mother passed away. After finishing the seventh grade school in his village, he worked as a kolkhoz farmer and as a laborer in the construction of a road (1945—1946). In 1949, he graduated the Kirov secondary school in Khorog, and in 1949—1954, he studied in Tajik Agricultural Institute. Starting from 1954, he began his scientific activities in the Pamir Botanical Garden, where he worked under the supervision of Anatoly Gursky and did research on consolidation and developing of sand and pebble massifs in Ishkashim District, as well as work over developing the collections and production nurseries in the Pamir Botanical Garden. In 1956, Khudoyor Yusufbekov performed his first experiments on the meadow formation of the desert pastures on the West Pamir.
Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR.
In 1957 he began his full-time post-graduate study at the Institute of Botany of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR in the city of Dushanbe under the supervision of professor Ivan Tsatsenkin (Moscow, the Williams All-Union Institute of Fodder) and pursued further his research on meadow formation of the mountainous deserted lands (slopes) in the Western Pamirs. After his graduation from the institute, he continued to work therein as a junior scientific worker. While working on further investigations of the Pamirs, he started the first experiments of improving the pastures in the central parts of Tajikistan (Kondara and Rangontay). During these years, Khudoyor Yusufbekov formulated and experimentally proved methods of creating highly productive forage lands by means of different types of irrigation systems for sowing grasses without disturbance of natural vegetation. The results of such investigations and tests introduced into the kolkhoz farm production of the Shughnan and Ishkashim districts of the GBAO in large areas were the basis of the master's thesis defended by him in 1961.
Pamir Biological Station of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR in Chechekty near Murghab.
In 1962—1969, he was the director of the Pamir Biological Station of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR, in the location of Chechekty (3860 meters above sea level) near Murghab — East Pamir, at the same time in 1965, he was elected the Chairman of the Bureau of the Pamir Base of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR.
During the working period at the biostation, he launched experimental work on improvement of pastures and hayfields in all areas of the GBAO, as well as the Alay Valley of the Kirghiz SSR. Under his leadership at the Pamir Biostation in 1964, three laboratories were created: 
The scientific research activity of the biostation (the beginning of manifestation of the scientific and organizational abilities of Khudoyor Yusufbekov) acquired a complex character. Here, along with the problems of ecological physiology and biochemistry of plants initiated by Professor Oleg Zalensky, further studies were carried out on experimental geobotanics, phyto-amelioration, soil studies, microorganisms, climatology, and the issues of crop cultivation in the Eastern Pamirs.
During the years of his work, the number of employees and the volume of scientific research significantly increased, which had a positive effect on the activities of the biostation. The traditions of the biostation laid by Pavel Baranov, Ilariya Raikova, Oleg Zalensky and Kirill Stanyukovich found a decent continuation in the activities of Khudoyor Yusufbekov.
During his work at the Pamir Biostation, Khudoyor Yusufbekov strengthened the material and technical base of the biological station with trucks, laboratory equipment, and chemical reagents in order to improve the conditions of the Pamir expeditionary survey and continued to improve methods for improving the desert and steppe pastures of the Pamir-Alay, by studying the structure of vegetation, and the topographical and ecological conditions of high-mountain pastures in a wide geographical and high-altitude range.
As a result, he developed a system of improving the feeding grounds of the Pamirs and the Alay Valley, differentiated by eco-geographical regions and high-altitude belts, and presented the findings in the form of a monograph published in 1968.
In 1968, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was elected a Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR.
In 1969, the monograph «Улучшение пастбищ и сенокосов Памира и Алайской долины» ("Improvement of pastures and hayfields of the Pamir and Alai Valley") was presented as a thesis (Moscow, the Williams All-Union Feed Institute), which Khudoyor Yusufbekov successfully defended to receive the degree of Doctor of Agricultural Sciences.
Pamir Biological Institute.
In October 1968, the President of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR Mstislav Keldysh arrived in the Pamirs and visited the Pamir Botanical Garden. He was accompanied by the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tajik SSR , the President of the Academy of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and the First Secretary of the Gorno-Badakhshan Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of Tajikistan, . Khudoyor Yusufbekov reported in details history of Pamir study to the high-ranking guests, about its natural resources, about the problems that needed to be solved in the field of biology, agriculture and, at the end, having justified the question of the necessity of creating a biological institute in the Pamirs, he asked the support of Mstislav Keldysh in consideration and resolution of this issue in Moscow. With the expansion and deepening of research at the Pamir Biological station, as well as growth of the number of scientific staff and taking into account the unique conditions in Pamir and in order to coordinate all studies related to the arid mountain areas, he stressed out the importance of this.
Soon, the president of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, Muhammad Osimi, and Khudoyor Yusufbekov were invited to Moscow to participate in the discussion of the establishment of a biological institute. At a joint meeting of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences and the USSR State Committee on Science and Technology, the issue was resolved positively. In 1969, all the biological agencies of Pamir such as the Pamir Biological Station in the Eastern Pamir (3860 m above sea level), Pamir Botanical Garden near the town of Khorugh (2320 m above sea level), and the outpost in Ishkashim (2600 m above sea level) were combined by Khudoyor Yusufbekov into the Pamir Biological Institute, the first director of which he became after its foundation (1969—1981). Currently, the institute is named after him (1992).
Khudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific and organizational abilities were revealed at the post of director of the institute. Along with scientific work, he also led a great deal of organizational activity. He determined the structure of the units of the Institute. Along with the traditional lines of research, he started scientific works on zoology, genetics plant breeding, and nature protection.
In 1970—1975, Khudoyor Yusufbekov developed a scheme for the master plan for development of the Anatoly Gursky Pamir Botanical Garden. To develop the scientific base, expand the areas of the botanical garden and preserve typical biological objects, more than 600 hectares of land in the vicinity of the botanical garden were obtained. In addition, 19 hectares of irrigated lands were connected to the territory of the garden, on the basis of which experimental sections of the Institute's units were organized. During the years of Khudoyor Yusufbekov's direct leadership (since 1965 till September 1990) of the fruit growing laboratory, situated at the altitude of 2700–3500 m, the area dedicated to the collection of global flora increased by 7 times, and the collection itself increased by 10 times, up to 4000 species and subspecies. The collections of plants in the garden are arranged according to geographical principles, and the irrigated territory is divided into 5 floristic departments: Central Asia and East Asia, Europe and the Caucasus, North America, the Himalayas, and the Hindu Kush. Inside the departments, the plants are arranged in generic complexes, taking into account ecological features of the species. In accordance with specifics of the objects of research in the garden, three groups were formed: dendrology, fodder and medicinal plants, and floriculture. The main task of the Pamir Botanical Garden was the introduction of plants. It exchanged seeds of highland flora and planting material with 112 gardens inside the USSR and 118 gardens from 39 major botanical centers of Europe (East Germany, West Germany, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia), North America (Canada and the United States), and other countries of the world. In 1972, a pumping station was built, thanks to which the waters of the river Shahdara raised to a height of 180 m. This enabled expanding the irrigated territory from 22 to 118 hectares at an altitude of 2140–2360 m, by over 5 times. The area of 4 floristic departments increased by 2 — 4 times. A laboratory, residential buildings, and the road and irrigation systems inside the garden of the Institute were built.
In Darvaz, a support center for introduction and acclimatization of subtropical and citrus plants in an 8 hectare area. Initiated in 1975 under his leadership, the experiments on introduction of citrus and other subtropical cultures in Darvaz proved the prospects for development of citrus cultivation in the Kalayikhumb district of the GBAO. At the Julius Fučík Sovkhoz (state farm), a lemon orchard was planted on a 1 hectare area, as well as pomegranate and fig gardens on 8 hectares. To the same extent, studies of shape diversity and distribution of sea buckthorn were successfully launched in 1976. Several forms of low-thorned sea buckthorn with high oil content were identified. Expediency of cultivating sea buckthorn on pebbles in floodplains of Pamir rivers was proved.
Khudoyor Yusufbekov's scientific interests covered a wide range of issues related to study of the nature of the Pamirs. Along with solving the problem of improving pastures, he collected significant material on protection, restoration and purposeful reconstruction of the vegetation of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. In the monograph "Растительность Западного Памира и опыт её реконструкции" ("The Vegetation of the Western Pamirs and the Experience of Its Reconstruction"), written jointly by , the Pamirs' territorial resources were analyzed, and he introduced the concept of a testing ground for land development (полигон мелиорации) of the Western Pamir. In that ground, he singled out 12 classes of land and provided valid recommendations for economic development of each of them. In the monograph, the model of the development of the Pamir, developed by Khudoyor Yusufbekov, is presented in the most complete form. Its constituent elements were the issues of complex vegetation reconstruction on sandy slopes and pebbles, furrowless watering on steep rocky slopes, reconstruction of vegetation of ancient terraces, mudflow cones of erosion, etc. Mountain slopes that had been eroded were supposed to be used in particular for orchards and meadowing between the plants by sowing perennial legumes. The scheme for reconstructing the vegetation of eroded slopes was not only developed, but also successfully tested in Shugnan, Rushan and Ishkashim districts of the GBAO.
Recommendations for the integrated reconstruction of vegetation on sands and gravels also found wide application in production. From just 1965 to 1980, the Gorno-Badakhshan forest organizarton created poplar and apricot plantations on an area of 1500 hectares. In the following years, planting works on blown sands and rocky terrain were conducted annually across an area of 300–350 hectares.
The main ideas and methods related to the plant development of the Pamirs were described by Khudoyor Yusufbekov in addition to the previously published works in the monographs "Методы возделывания полезных растений на Памире" ("Methods of cultivating useful plants in the Pamirs", 1972), "Терескен на Памире" ("Teresken in the Pamirs", 1972), "Pamir" (1973) and in numerous brochures, collections and articles. At present more than 300 scientific works have been published.
A lot of work was done to prepare and grow the scientific staff of the Institute, taking into account the specific difficulties and the remoteness of the Pamirs from major scientific centers. By the end of 1975, the Pamir Biological Institute staff numbered over 100 people, of which 45 were researchers. Scientists from other regions of the Soviet Union were invited to work at the Institute, and concrete measures were taken to train personnel on the ground through postgraduate study and competition. During the period of the leadership of Khudoyor Yusufbekov, two doctoral and more than 30 candidate dissertations were defended by just the staff of the biostation and the institute alone. At the same time, communication with many research institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences was established: Timiryazev Institute of Plant Physiology, Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy (IAE), the Institute of Botany, the Pavlovsky Institute of Zoology and Parasitology of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, and other scientific research institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR.
Khudoyor Yusufbekov's love for the nature of the Pamirs and his concern for the preservation of the natural environment and scientific history of the Pamirs also manifested in the fact that under his leadership the Museum "The Nature of the Pamir" was organized. Later, even when he was the rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute, he continued to take an interest in the work and development of the museum, which is now very popular among visitors, including foreigners. Khudoyor Yusufbekov, wherever he worked, created museums in which it was possible to get acquainted with the history and achievements of science in a visual form. He believed that all this served the birth of innovative research and the continuation of scientific development in the future.
Tajik Agricultural Institute.
In May 1981, Khudoyor Yusufbekov was transferred to work in Dushanbe at the post of rector of the Tajik Agricultural Institute of the Main Administration of Agricultural Higher Educational Institutions of the Ministry of Agriculture of the USSR (1981—1986). Here he paid much attention to development of research work at the departments and attraction of the students to the scientific research activities in the scientific and student councils. He systematically organized conferences, meetings, and symposiums on many aspects of agricultural science. The educational base of the Institute was strengthened so the students would master practical skills in solving specific production issues; for that, new educational facilities based on the sovkhoz "Yavan-2" of the Yavan district were organized. Khudoyor Yusufbekov made significant efforts to complete the construction of a new building of the zoological engineering faculty, which was completed in 1987. Khudoyor Yusufbekov organized new departments for the preparation of highly qualified specialists of fruit and wine growing, a laboratory for collective use of scientific devices at the agronomic faculty, a laboratory of computing machinery at the faculty of economics, and three new chairs at the institute. Under him, entrance examinations using computers were held for the first time, he also created a museum dedicated to the history of the Institute. As an specialist in the introduction of new species, Khudoyor Yusufbekov made an optimal decision to reconstruct and place green spaces on the territory adjacent to the institute. He conducted teaching activities at the department of agriculture, lectured at the course "Meadow Fodder Production" for students. He was the Chairman of the specialized scientific councils for protection of Ph.D. theses on specialties "Plant Growing" and "Selection and Seed Farming". While he had this job, Khudoyor Yusufbekov still continued to conduct scientific management of the subjects of research of the Pamir Botanical Garden and the laboratory of high-altitude fruit growing, as well as supervising the work of the graduate students.
The Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR.
Khudoyor Yusufbekov was the Academician Secretary of the Biological Department of the Academy of Sciences of Tajik SSR (1986—1990). He had a wide range of scientific interests in the field of biology. The Biological department of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR was one of its subunits. It consisted of scientific instituts devoted to biology-related issues like: botany, zoology and parasitology (the institute was named after academician Yevgeny Pavlovsky), physiology and biophysics of plants, gastroenterology, general genetics and safety, and rational utilization of natural resources. The Pamir Biological Institute, later named after Khudoyor Yusufbekov himself, was also included here. In 1989, he became the Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR. On his initiative, being at the same time the chairman of the Pamir scientific research base and a Member of the Presidium of the Academy of Sciences of the Tajik SSR, the Department of Pamir Studies from the Rudaki Institute of Language and Literature was relocated to Khorog from Dushanbe; the Department of Social and Economic Research of the Pamir Research Base in the Pamirs was established, later on the basis of these two departments after his death (11/27/1990), in 1991 the Institute of Humanities in the Pamirs was established
Death.
In 1990, Khudoyor Yusufbekovich Yusufbekov fell sick, passing away at the Dushanbe hospital No. 4 on November 27 of that year. On the request of the leadership of the Tajik SSR and the Academy of Science of the Tajik SSR, his body had been transported by plane to the town of Khorog where he was buried in the Pamir Botanical Garden, on the top of the highest hill.

Our Lady of Łukawiec

Our Lady of Łukawiec (Polish: Matka Boża Łukawiecka), earlier Our Lady of Tartaków (Polish: Matka Boża Tartakowska), also known as Our Lady Full of Graces (Polish: Matka Boża Łaskawa) is a Roman Catholic icon of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Description.
The painting shows the Mother of God standing one foot on the crescent moon that is on top of a dying dragon. Mary is dressed in a long, down-to-earth dress, covered with a dark blue cloak. Her hair is dissolved, reaching her shoulders, and her head is turned to the right, slightly tilted down. Mary has slightly closed eyes, and her face is focused and gentle. Hands are folded for prayer. In the lower part of the painting, under the feet of the Mother of God you can see the winged dragon, who is dying, and next to the apple lying on the ground. Above Mother of God's figure floats God the Father with a gray beard, clothed in robes, spreading His hands over Mary, protecting Her and the whole Earth. On the right and left you can see Marian symbols like lilies among thorns, Mirror of Justice, Tree of Life on the left side and the Blue Gate, the Burning Bush and the Tower of David on the right. Clouds are visible in the image. The colors of the upper part are bright, while the bottom, where the dragon is visible, the colors are dark, showing the contrast.
History.
In Tartaków.
The painting was painted on a canvas stuck to the board at the beginning of the 17th century by an Italian painter and placed at the Potocki castle in the town of Tartaków. "It imagines Blessed Virgin Mary with hands folded to pray, standing on the moon, under which the rolled-up snake bites the apple. Above her, God the Father spreads his hands". After the great fire of the castle, the painting found its way to chaplain Stanisław Potocki and the local parish priest Mikołaj Kucharski in 1727. After his death, the image of the Blessed Virgin, was in 1764 placed in the local Catholic church above the baptismal font and almost from the very beginning he began to be famous for favors, which meant that he was moved the following year to the high altar. In 1765 from 9 to 24 March, the painting, as it was described, "cried". From the eyes of Our Lady, bloody tears squeezed out, which fell or dried in the image. In those days, a clear glow was visible over the church, so that it was thought that a fire would break out. Many people have also seen that the picture was colored. In 1777, the painting was considered miraculous, and two years later placed in a specially prepared, on the initiative of priest Kostkiewicz, a new huge main altar. In a special book there are 407 cases of miracles made through the image, and a number of over 300 gifts for the grace received (so-called votives).
In Łukawiec.
In 1944, the painting was successfully saved from destruction thanks to the Poles, through his deportation to the wooden Church of the Epiphany in Łukawiec near Lubaczów. Initially, in 1963, the painting found itself in Lubaczów, and the parish in Tarnoszyn also sought for it. In the end, however, the painting, famous for its graces, was handed over to the Łukawiec parish. Due to the increasing number of the believers, both from Łukawiec and from Tartaków, a decision was made to build a new church in Łukawiec. The Church of Blessed Virgin Mary Queen of Poland in Łukawiec was consecrated by Bishop Marian Jaworski in 1990. In the same year, the image of Mary was placed in the main altar. The new church became the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Łukawiec. On June 3, 1991, the painting was crowned in Lubaczów by Pope John Paul II during one of his pilgrimages to Poland. On May 15, 2004, a dedicated and crowned copy of the painting was donated to the church in Tartaków. In 2016, the painting underwent renovation in Krakow. On June 3, 2016, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of the miraculous image of Our Lady of Łukawiec fell out. On this occasion a new huge altar was made in the parish church. On June 4, 2016, a miraculous picture was placed in the new altar. The consecration of the new altar was made by Archbishop Mieczysław Mokrzycki, who comes from Łukawiec on June 8, 2016 during the main anniversary celebrations. From now on, the picture is solemnly unveiled and shaded by the sound of a fanfare and a song to the Mother of God.

Gibraltar Barracks, Minley

Gibraltar Barracks is a military installation at Minley in Hampshire.
History.
The Royal Engineers first arrived at Minley with an engineer brigade in the early 1970s. The corps occupied Minley Manor and initially used it as their brigade headquarters. The Queen visited the site to initiate works on modern military facilities on the opposite side of the A327 Minley Road in October 1976. The new facilities were officially opened, as Gibraltar Barracks, by General Sir William Jackson in September 1979, the manor going on to serve as its officers' mess.
Between 2008 and 2013, as part of the RSME-PPP project, the Holdfast consortium redeveloped the barracks and built a new officers' mess on the site so allowing the manor to be sold. 8th Engineer Brigade moved to Gibraltar Barracks in 2014.
In 2021, the corps headquarters of the Royal Corps of Army Music moved from Kneller Hall in Twickenham to Gibraltar Barracks.

Incheon Lee clan

Incheon Lee clan () is a Korean clan. This clan traces their origin to King Suro and his Queen Heo Hwang-ok, who are mentioned in the 13th-century Korean chronicle "Samguk Yusa". King Suro was the founder of Gaya confederacy, and his descendant Gim Yu-sin is renowned for unifying the Silla polity. According to a 2015 survey, the population of Gimhae Heo clan is 83,855. 
More than six million present day Koreans, especially from Gimhae Kim, Gimhae Heo clan and Incheon Lee clan (Yi) clans, trace their lineage to the legendary queen as the direct descendants of Queen Heo Hwang-ok's children with King Kim Suro. These 3 clans associate their Bon-gwan (geo-biological lineage roots) to Gimhae in South Gyeongsang Province of Korea, and these clans place restrictions on marriage with each other due to the shared ancestors. According to "Samguk Yusa" Queen Heo Hwang-ok became the wife of King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya at the age of 16, after having arrived in Gaya confederacy in Korea in the year 48 AD by boat from a distant kingdom called "Ayuta", making her the first queen of Geumgwan Gaya. Her native kingdom is believed to be located in India by some; there is, however, no mention of her in any pre-modern Indian sources. There are tombs in Gimhae in Korea, that are believed by some to be of King Suro and Queen Heo, and a memorial of Queen Heo Hwang-ok in Hindu holy city of Ayodhya in India.
Name.
The founder of Gimhae Heo clan, a 23rd generation descendant of Queen Heo Hwang-ok and King Suro, was Heo Gi (). He was sent to Tang dynasty as an ambassador of Silla. Lee clan, the surname of Emperor Xuanzong of Tang, was bestowed on Heo Gi () because Heo Gi () helped Emperor Xuanzong of Tang escape from the An Lushan Rebellion. When Lee Heo Gi () returned to Silla, King Gyeongdeok of Silla awarded the ""Prince of Soseong ():" title to Lee Heo Gi (). Later, , a 10th generation descendant of Lee Heo Gi () and the grandfather of Queen Wonseong, began the Incheon Lee clan.
Origin.
The Incheon Lee clan founder was King Suro, whose wife was Queen Heo Hwang-ok. She set sail from India, later arriving at Gimhae. Some sources have identified Ayodhya in North India as the native place of Queen Heo Hwang-ok, while other sources identify her being of Tamil origin from South India. 
Queen Heo Hwang-ok's association with Ayodhya is based on the book "Heo Hwang-ok Route: From India to Gaya of Korea" by a Senior Archeologist and Emeritus Professor at Hanyang University, Kim Byung-mo, which is considered speculative by some. The Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok in Ayodhya, is visited by a large number of Koreans, especially around jesa in April, to pay tribute to Queen Heo Hwang-ok as she is considered an ancestor to more than six million Koreans. She was supposedly of Indian-origin from Ayodhya and had traveled to Korea to marry King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya in 48 CE.

Jean Elleinstein

Jean Elleinstein (6 August 1927 – 16 January 2002) was a French historian specializing in communism.
Biography.
Son of a small industrialist, Jean Elleinstein had to cross the demarcation line in 1941 and live illegally until 1944 when he joined the Milices Patriotiques (Patriotic Militia) in Megève. He joined the French Communist Party at the Liberation at the age of seventeen. He soon became a Party member, first as a journalist with the communist press agency, then at the PCF press office, before being assigned to the Mouvement Jeunes Communistes de France and the World Federation of Democratic Youth.
His activities against the Indochina war, caused him to spend a few weeks in prison in 1949, then sixteen months in hiding in 1952–53. He then resumed his studies, became a professor in 1954, passed the CAPES (diploma in teaching - secondary schools) in history in 1958, his diploma in teaching higher education in 1960 and was appointed lecturer. At the same time, he was responsible for the founding of the Union of Communist Students.
The 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1956 and, in 1960–1961, the "Servin-Casanova affair" - named after two high-ranking Communist leaders sanctioned for their Khrushchevian theses - shook his convictions. A little marginal in the party, but strongly supported by Roland Leroy, Elleinstein used a freedom of tone that brought him closer to the Italian or Spanish communists. Appointed deputy director of the Center for Marxist Studies and Research, between 1972 and 1975 he published a 4-volume history of the Soviet Union ("Histoire de l'URSS") in which he diverted substantially from the orthodox version that had been expressed since 1945 by Jean Bruhat. In line with the policy of openness of the time of the Union of the Left and Eurocommunism, his history was authorised by the PCF. Further exploiting his freedom to speake, in 1975 Elleinstein published "History of the Stalinist phenomenon" in which he analyzes Stalinism as the unfortunate product of historical circumstances.
The 22nd French Communist Party Congress in 1976 was marked by an attempted break with the Soviet system spearheaded by . Ellerstein became the non-official spokesman for a communism now redefined to be democratic and revised, with his book, "Le PC", (the French Communist Party), and his "Open Letter to the French people about a reformed republic based on the Programme commun", 
Following the failure of the Union of the Left in 1977 and the rapprochement of PCF leader Georges Marchais with Brezhnev, and especially in view of Ellerstein's regular contributions to "Figaro" Magazine, by the second half of 1980, the conventional wisdom among upper echelons of the PCF was "that he had ejected himself from the party" and that there was therefore no need to eject him formally.

Da Yu ding

The Da Yu "ding" () is an ancient Chinese bronze circular "ding" vessel from the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BC). Excavated in Li Village, Mei County, Shaanxi, it is on display in the National Museum of China.
The Da Yu "ding", the Da Ke "ding" in the Shanghai Museum, and the Mao Gong "ding" in the National Palace Museum in Taipei are famous bronze dings.
Description.
The tripod is round, with three legs, a common shape during the Western Zhou dynasty. It is high and weighs . Its aperture is . Its mouth is engraved with Taotie patterns and its four legs are engraved with animal face patterns. The king attributed to is King Kang of Zhou (1020–996 BC), and the date is attributed to the 23rd Year of the king, the Western Zhou dynasty (1046–771 BC) 
Inscription.
The tripod's inside features 19 lines collectively containing 291 Chinese characters. Most is the King's Speech. The first speech is a historical overview in which he provides a moral rationale for the fall of the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC) and the rise of the Western Zhou. Here, the King said that drinking wine in excess has made the Shang dynasty lose the Mandate of Heaven, grace, and the army, while the Kings of Zhou do not drink excessively even ceremonially. The King further commands Yu() to support the King and to work official service throughout days. The second speech is a short charge to Yu to emulate his late grandfather, Nang Gong. The third speech is the appointment of the king's minister with army power and a detailed inventory given by the King. The last section of the inscription is Yu himself recording that he made this tripod for his deceased grandfather Nang Gong in response to the king's kindness. It was the king's 23rd year. The inclusion of 1726 slaves in the listed inventory is an important historical resource for studying slavery.
History.
In the Daoguang era (1821–1851) of the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), this tripod was unearthed in Li village, Mei County, Shaanxi. Song Jinjian (; 1821–1863), a local rich man, acquired it. Next, the governor Zhou Gengsheng () expropriated it. After he died, Song Jinjian recovered the tripod.
Before winter 1873, Yuan Baoheng (; 1826–1878), a follower of Zuo Zongtang bought it for 700 taels of silver. Yuan may have sent the tripod he bought to Zuo. In 1875, Zuo Zongtang presented the tripod he treasured as a gift to Pan Zuyin (; 1830–1890) in Beijing.
Pan Zuyin was a famous collector with rich knowledge in Chinese characters. In 1890, Pan acquired the Da Ke "ding", the second largest bronzeware of the Western Zhou dynasty after the Da Yu "ding". His younger brother Pan Zunian (; 1870–1925) inherited the family property. In about 1896, the Pan family moved to Suzhou from Beijing with their collection, including the two tripods.
In 1937, the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out. Fearing looting or destruction, the Pan family packed the two tripods in a wood box and buried it.
In 1951, Pan Dayu (; 1906–2007) donated the two tripods to the Shanghai Museum. There, they would be displayed together until 1959, when the Da Yu "ding" was transferred to the National Museum of China in Beijing. In March 2004, to celebrate Pan Dayu's 100 birthday, the Da Yu "ding" was transferred to the Shanghai Museum for a limited time display, the first time the tripods were together in nearly 50 years.

2018 Makassar mayoral election

The 2018 Makassar mayoral election took place on 27 June 2018 as part of the simultaneous local elections. It was held to elect the mayor of Makassar and the deputy mayor.
CEO of Indonesian professional football club PSM Makassar Munafri Arifuddin, who was supported by 8 of 9 political parties in the People's Representative Council, was the only candidate in an uncontested election. Incumbent mayor Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto initially registered to run for a second term as an independent candidate, but his candidacy was later revoked by a Supreme Court ruling.
Despite running as a single candidate, Arifuddin lost the vote to an empty ballot ("kotak kosong"), forcing the election to be repeated in 2020 and for an acting mayor to be appointed by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Although a lawsuit was brought to the Constitutional Court, the appeal was rejected, making the election the first in Indonesian electoral history in which an empty ballot won.
Timeline.
The KPU set a temporary voter count at 862,731 in March 2018, spread across 15 subdistricts. The voters voted at 2,765 polling stations. A budget of Rp 60 billion (US$4.35 million) was assigned for the election, of which 16.4 billion came from the 2017 budget and the rest from the 2018 fiscal year. Registration for party-backed candidates was opened between 8 and 10 January 2018, while independent candidates were required to register between 22 and 26 November 2017. The campaign period was from 15 February to 24 June, with a three-day election silence before voting on 27 June. The vote itself follows a first past the post system.
The candidates were assigned their ballot numbers on 13 February 2018.
Candidates.
Munafri Arifuddin, a member of Golkar and nephew of the then-Vice President Jusuf Kalla, was supported by 10 parties. Also the CEO of the PSM Makassar football club, he had promised to keep this position if elected. Arifuddin's running mate Rachmatika Dewi was a deputy speaker of the city council and the chief of Nasdem in Makassar.
Although initially supported by some political parties, Mohammad Ramdhan Pomanto registered with the KPU as an independent candidate, having collected 117,492 valid copies of ID cards out of the ~65,000 required as an independent candidate. Demokrat was the only party represented in the People's Representative Council that officially supported him. Other parties declared their initial support to him, but withdrew later. His running mate Indira Mulyasari was the deputy speaker of the city council, although she resigned for the election.
In February, the Munafri-Dewi pair sued the local KPU in order to cancel Pomanto's candidacy, citing a case in which Pomanto distributed smartphones while serving as the city's mayor. The South Sulawesi high court on national administration ("Pengadilan Tinggi Tata Usaha Negara") on March 21 ordered the KPU to cancel Pomanto's candidacy. The election body then brought the case to the Supreme Court, which upheld the PT TUN decision. Pomanto stated that he would continue pressing his case through the legal system. However, the electoral commission decided to disqualify him following a closed-door meeting, making the election an uncontested one. However, Arifuddin was still required to win a majority of the votes (voters could vote for an empty ballot) or the elections would be redone in 2020.
Aftermath.
Following the announcement of the results, the Munafri-Dewi campaign team filed a lawsuit to the Constitutional Court, claiming "structured, systematic and massive cheating", accusing Pomanto of having interfered in favor of the "none of the above option" within his capacity as mayor, and demanding that the "none of the above" option/empty column be cancelled. In 10 August, the court ruled against the appeal, hence awarding "victory" for the none of the above option - the first in Indonesian electoral history.

Zwicker collected on his tours as a policeman for decades materials and spread the district history in photo lectures in restaurants.
From 1960 the collection was shown as the "Brigittenauer Heimatmuseum" in the premises of the Volkshochschule Brigittenau in Raffaelgasse 13; Zwicker was active as curator, the museum was managed by Prof. Anton Raschka, who was strongly committed to founding the museum.
Later Heinrich Zwicker withdrew from the project due to differences in personnel. A new collection had to be built up for the museum. From April 1984, the museum was housed for ten years at Engerthstraße 60-74 in former health insurance rooms.
Location.
In May 1994 the museum was opened in a building built in 1889 in the Historicist style, later the villa of the manufacturer Friedrich Bertram (the so-called "Bertram-Schlössl"). A commemorative plaque was noted in the building: "The building of today's museum in Dresdner Straße 79 was originally built by the Friedrich and Anna Schmid family in 1889 as a residential building, on foundations a ferry house, which was later purchased by the industrialist Bertram and used as an office and residential building." Before that, the company Friedrich Weichmann's Witwe, II. factory of signalling and lighting objects for railways, was located at the address.
Engineer Karl August Czeija (1843-1909) founded a workshop for mechanics and telegraph construction in Vienna in 1880. In 1884, the electrical engineer Franz Nissl (1852-1942) took a stake in the company, which was now called "Telephon- und Telegraphenfabrik Czeija, Nissl &amp; Co. The company played a major role in the development of the telephone network of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and built the first radio stations and radios in series from 1923. The company had been located on Dresdner Strasse since 1907 and used the Bertram-Schlössl. From 1957 the company was called "Standard Telephon- und Telegraphen-AG Czeija, Nissl &amp; Co. (STT)", which became "ITT Austria GmbH" in 1970 (since 1987 "Alcatel Austria AG", currently "Alcatel-Lucent") and which moved out of the site at the end of the 1970s.
The villa, which has been vacant since 1981, was purchased by the City of Vienna together with the factory area behind it on Dresdner Strasse 75-79 and restored over two years. The total area is around 600 m², 200 m² of which is accounted for by the depot in the attic.
The Bezirksmuseum is located near the stop Wien Traisengasse of the S-Bahn Wien at the North railway (Nordbahn) and the stop of the same name of the tram line 2 running through Dresdner Straße.
Exhibition Collection.
The museum uses plans, exhibits, pictures, views and models to document the development of the district located on an island between the Danube Canal and the Danube. Some themes are permanently shown in permanent exhibitions. In addition, there are special exhibitions of various sizes, which usually take place in the lecture hall on the ground floor or in the first large room on the first floor. Old views and plans related to the district can be seen in the artistically decorated staircase.
The other rooms on the first floor contain the basic exhibition on the industrial and cultural development of the district. In the first room on the street you can see exhibits on everyday history and social life. In the middle room, the exhibition "The Brigittenau before 1900" is shown, which deals with the development from a floodplain to an industrial area. Another room shows the technical development of the telephone and Austria's earliest radio station, Radio Hekaphon. The company "Czeija, Nissl &amp; Co", at that time a leading high-tech company, conducted the radio test operation at today's WUK (Kulturzentrum) in 1923/1924 until Radio Verkehrs AG (RAVAG) started its regular operation.
At the back is the transport sector, among other things. A model of a forerunner of the tram in Vienna, the "Brigittenauer Pferdebahn" (tram with horses), can be seen. A large model shows the Wien Nordwestbahnhof (Northwest Station) near the museum during its time as a passenger station. A memorial exhibition of Robert Blum, including original letters, commemorates the life of this 1848 revolutionary who was executed in Brigittenau. The exhibition "Brigittenau in the Resistance" recalls the time of National Socialism and the victims of the Holocaust in the district. The Red Vienna and the Brigittenau, the once very famous Brigitta church around the Brigitta Chapel, the entertainment establishments "Colosseum" and "Universum", the Brigitta Hospital and the Men's Home at Meldemannstraße 27, where Adolf Hitler temporarily lived, are also part of the exhibition.
The permanent exhibition "Brigittenau - location for trade, commerce and industry" illustrates the economic development of Brigittenau with pictures and objects. The spectrum of companies compiled by the curator Ernst Schättle so far ranges from the gingerbread baking tin to the stovepipe. The company headquarters are marked on a large district map. The following companies are currently on display:
An exhibition in an outbuilding shows the development of the Danube. It plays a very important role for the Brigittenau, which lies on an island between the Donaukanal (Danube Canal) and the Danube. Topics are the floods, the history of the Vienna Danube regulations, the first from 1870 and the second from 1972, which led to the construction of the New Danube. A central piece of the exhibition is the 1996 Danube Atlas, a unique technical and cultural-historical documentation with 280 maps and plans from the area from Korneuburg to Fischamend. Other topics include shipping, fishing on the Danube and electricity construction work.
In addition to the exhibitions, the museum offers further information. There is a library, negative images, a slide archive, video documentation and a collection of journals and documents. The museum also has materials on Eastern history (at the time of Austria-Hungary) and the Glagolitic script.

Punchi Banda Elangasinha, Rate Mahatmaya (; 6 April 1888 – 22 September 1960) was a Sri Lankan notary public, traditional eye doctor, astrologist and musicologist. Best known for writing the anthems of Dharmaraja College, Hillwood College, and Rahula College as well as the first national anthem of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), “Sri Lanka Matha Pala Yasa Mahima Jaya Jaya” in collaboration with Lionel Edirisinghe
Biography.
P. B. Elangasinha was born on 6 April 1888 in Illawathura, Gampola and receivied his primary education at the Buddhist Mixed School, Gampola, and St. Thomas College, Mathara. He went to St. Thomas Teachers Training school before being appointed as the headmaster of Waebada Buddhist School. He pioneered and served as the president of "Samastha Lanka As Weda Sangamaya‟ (All Island Society of Traditional Eye Doctors) and "Samastha Lanka Sarpa Visha Veda Sangamaya‟ (All Island Society of Traditional Venom Doctors). Students were trained at his home to perform Buddhist Carols composed by him for annual Buddhist ceremonies. He served as a music director and a music exam inspector of "Jathika Gandharwa Sabha‟ (National Association of Musicians).
Elangasinha was selected to be a part of Lanka Gandharva Sabha's judging panel, along with SLB Kapukotuwa, Dr.OHD Wijesekera, Lionel Edirisinghe, Mudliyar EA Abeysekera and LLK Gunatunga to determine the country's national anthem. In a controversial decision, the song written by P. B. Elangasinha and set to music by Lionel Edirisinghe was announced to be the new National Anthem. The fact that a song submitted by two members of the selection panel had “won” the national song competition evoked widespread resentment and protests. It was seen as blatantly unfair. Although the song by the Elangasinha-Edirisinghe duo was broadcast over the then “Radio Ceylon” on the morning of Independence day as the national song it was not sung at the official Freedom Day ceremony due to protests. While the song itself was flawless and above reproach it was the perception of favoritism in the decision to adopt it that fueled criticism and protests. Thus the song which won the national song competition was unacceptable as far as the people were concerned.
Elangasinha's service to his motherland earned him the honorary title "Rate Mahatmaya‟.

2008–2009 neo-Nazi murders of Roma in Hungary

The Budapest serial killings were a series of murders perpetrated by four Neo-Nazis (Árpád Zoltán Kiss, István Sándor Kiss, Zsolt István Pető and accomplice István Csaba Csontos) against people of Roma ethnicity, occurring between July 2008 and August 2009. It is regarded as one of the worst crimes in the country's history after the war.
The perpetrators had previously obtained firearms and Molotov cocktails after robbing a house in Besenyszög, using them in numerous attacks in 10 locations, killing six people in the process. The subsequent investigation revealed that the gang were skinheads from Debrecen, and their motive was retaliation for crimes committed by gypsies and a desire to incite anti-Roma sentiment among the ethnic Hungarian population.
All four were arrested on August 21, 2009 at a nightclub in Debrecen, where two of them worked as bouncers. The criminal proceedings began on March 25, 2011 and lasted until August 6, 2013. Árpád Kiss, István Kiss and Zsolt Pető were sentenced to life imprisonment, while István Csontos was a given a 13-year sentence without a chance of parole, with an expected release date of August 2022.
Case overview.
Pretext.
From the very beginning, the four men planned the crimes in advance, selecting several sites which received high media coverage because of past incidents involving the Roma and non-Roma population.
The weapons used to carry out the attacks were acquired from a robbery on March 7, 2008. On that day, the Kisses and Pető, who were aided by an unidentified accomplice, broke into the home of a hunter in Besenyszög, who had previously offered to sell them his Franchi M610 VSL. Presenting themselves as police officers, they tied up the occupants with duct tape, threatening them with two objects that resembled real guns. The robbers scavenged the hunter's weapon cabinet, taking the following items: a 7x64mm Mauser rifle with a Swarovski Optik scope, a 12x76mm Fabarm MAX2 Bock sporting rifle, a 12x76mm Franchi M610 VSL semi-automatic shotgun, a FÉG Bock shotgun, an IZS-58 MHE shotgun, a 22mm BRNO M2E hunting rifle, a 16x70mm 158 type rifle and two double-barrel shotguns.
After the robbery, the gang began to plan and scout their locations from an apartment on Poroszlay Street in Debrecen. The vehicle used for the attacks was an Opel Astra belonging to Árpád Kiss' wife, which initially had its license plate covered, but later was replaced by fakes manufactured by István Kiss' girlfriend, Edit.
Attacks.
Debrecen.
In preparation for the crimes, the gang decided to hold a practise shooting. On June 2, 2008, after midnight, Árpád Kiss fired several shots at the refugee camp in Debrecen with one of the rifles.
Galgagyörk.
Galgagyörk was chosen as the first location because there had been previous clashes between the ethnic Hungarian and Roma communities, which were heavily reported in the press. More specifically, the men learned of it from a report on Echo TV about an ethnic Hungarian family being driven out of their homes and the involvement of the Magyar Gárda. While the people who had forced the family to leave were never identified, the gang nevertheless decided to opt for an attack on the local gypsies.
On July 21, 2008, the Kisses and Pető opened fire on several residential buildings and breaking several windows. While several people, including minors, were present during the attacks, no injuries were reported. The attack was considered a failure, as the press erroneously considered that this might've been caused by a local feud between residents.
Piricse.
Due to the lack of media coverage, the perpetrators considered the Galgagyörk attack to be a failure. This led Árpád and István Kiss to plan another one, and on August 7, 2008, the two of them met with Zsolt Pető to plan their next move, agreeing that they strike in Piricse. The trio got into a car and drove towards their destination, stopping at Encsencs to change the license plate. On the night of August 8, 2008, Molotov cocktails were thrown at two houses on Ady Endre Street and a shotgun shot fired through the window of one building. One of the sleeping occupants, Magdolna Gyetyinás, left the house to check out what was going on, causing István Kiss to shoot her with one of the shotguns, hitting her in the leg and elbow. During their escape, the trio fired several more shots at the houses.
Nyíradony.
On the night of September 5, 2008, Árpád Kiss carried out another attack by himself in Nyíradony, using the Mauser rifle to penetrate the window of a house on Jázmin Street in the Tamásipuszta section of the village. Two adults and their four children, in addition to the victim's mother and three minor siblings and brothers, were present in the building, but none were harmed. While they had woken up from the attacks, they decided to wait for the attacker to leave, refraining from switching the lights on as to not draw attention.
Tarnabod.
During their next meeting on September 27, the main trio planned another attack, this time in Tarnabod, where it was reported that some Roma had murdered an elderly man. In addition to their usual armament and clothing, they also carried with themselves VHF radios to keep in contact.
Two days later, at midnight, Zsolt Pető threw two Molotov cocktails at a house on Tarna Street, one at the wall and the other at a window, before firing at it with his Fabarm. Meanwhile, the Kisses threw their cocktails at another house, before all three fled towards Tarna Creek. Along the way, they shot at another victim who was standing by the window in his home, but failed to hit him. In total, five buildings were shot at or had Molotov cocktails thrown at them, but miraculously none of the residents had been harmed.
Despite the attackers' intentions, they had unknowingly attacked ethnic Hungarian residents living in the village, as that neighborhood was populated mainly by elderly women.
Nagycsécs.
On November 3, 2008, the trio attacked two houses on György Dózsa Street in Nagycsécs. One of the buildings was occupied by a married couple and their mentally handicapped, deaf-mute child and the homeowner's physically disabled brother; the other had another couple and their two minor children.
Árpád Kiss had stationed himself at a field with his Mauser, covering for István Kiss and Zsolt Pető, who were throwing cocktails at the building. The noise caused the occupants of the buildings to wake up and start extinguishing the flames. The attackers shot and killed József and Tiborné Nagy on the spot, and severely wounded the other man from the adjacent building.
A peculiarity noticed by investigators was that, despite István Csontos not being present during this attack, footprints from a fourth person were found at the crime scene, whose identity has not been established to this day.
Alsózsolca.
Another attack was carried out on December 15, 2008 on Pista Dankó Street in Alsózsolca, with the targets being an 18-year-old and a 16-year-old chopping firewood near their home. Árpád Kiss shot at the 18-year-old from the other side of the Sajó river with his Mauser, missing him, but instead piercing through his companion's clothing. He fired another shot, hitting the older victim in the hip area and causing him to collapse. Despite his life threatening condition, he was rescued, but was left permanently disabled from his injuries.
Tatárszentgyörgy.
In 2007, a conflict occurred between ethnic Hungarian and Roma residents in Tatárszentgyörgy, leading to intervention from the Magyar Gárda and members of the National Guard, a right-wing paramilitary organization demanding for the segregation of Romas from ethnic Hungarians. This stunt subsequently led to the organization being outlawed by the government. Because of his incident, the gang chose Tatárszentgyörgy as their next target.
On February 23, 2009, the trio arrived in front of a house on Fenyves Street, occupied by 29-year-old Róbert Csorbá, his wife and three children. Árpád Kiss hid himself in the trees while his two cohorts attacked head on, with Zsolt Pető throwing two Molotov cocktails into the attic and walls, causing them to light on fire. When Csorba noticed the fire, he picked up two of his children and ran towards the patio door. He was seen by István Kiss, who fired at the terrace twice with his Franchi, fatally hitting Róbert and his 4-year-old son, Robiká, and seriously injuring the daughter Bianká, who fled back towards the house.
Tiszalök.
In this incident, the three main perpetrators were joined for the first time by István Csontos, who knew of the previous attacks and wanted to participate due to his anti-gypsy convictions, acting as their getaway driver. Unlike the previous times, Zsolt Pető was not present during the attack in Tiszalök. While Árpád and István Kiss were committing the crime, Csontos waited in nearby Polgár, returning to the crime scene to pick up the brothers and then leave.
Tiszalök was chosen due a 2008 parade organized by the National Guard, and the subsequent counter-protest by the Roma community. The attack took place on April 22, 2009 at 10PM, with Árpád, who was hiding in some nearby grass, opening fire with his shotgun at a house on Nefelejcs Street. This caused the homeowner, Jenö Kóka, to try and flee via the yard, but was seen by the attackers, who shot at him with their rifles, hitting him in the chest and killing him on the spot.
Prior to the murder, police assured the public that they could cordon off the county in a maximum of ten minutes. However, an hour and a half after the murder, one of the Kiss brothers phoned Csontos and told him to pick them up. Csontos was stopped on the way by police officers, but despite having an empty guitar case, military binoculars, maps and a radio in his car, Csontos was let go by the officer and wasn't questioned further. Ten minutes later, he picked up the brothers from a nearby railway embankment and they all drove away from the area. On the way back, the car got stuck in mud on a dirt road, making Árpád Kiss make a phone call to his partner, Évá N., to help them out (this call would later be used to track down the killers). Évá N. went there in the early hours with her own car, picked up the trio and drove them back to Debrecen, with them returning back the next day with a farmer, whom they had asked to help tow their car away with his tractor. This happened only 40 kilometers away from the crime scene.
Kisléta.
The last known attack occurred in Kisléta on August 3, 2009. On that night, the Kiss brothers and Zsolt Pető approached a house on Bocskai Street from the fields, while István Csontos returned to Debrecen with the car until he would be called back to pick his associates.
After approaching the front door, two of them kicked it down and broke inside, where Pető fired at the doorframes with his Fabarm. They then went to the bedroom and opened fire at the two people they found lying in bed. The mother, Mária Balogh, was killed on the spot, while her daughter, Ketrin, who was hiding behind her mother, survived. After the incident, she was left with permanent brain damage.
After the attack in Kisléta, police patrols were increased in the area, so one of the men began carrying around a pistol, in case a shoot-out with police occurred. Disappointed with the resutls, the trio planned to also attack the mayor of the village, who, according to them, was a leftist who always gave the jobs to gypsies. Later on, an allegation by a Magyar Gárda employee claimed that one of the men likely attended Mária Balogh's funeral, as a suspicious man with a tattoo on his right upper arm, most likely Árpád Kiss, was seen there.
Later plans.
The perpetrators planned to acquire new weapons before they were captured, so they re-browsed gun advertisements on the internet and also began mapping the sellers' residences. They also considered acquiring high-powered automatic weapons from the military barracks in Hajdúhadház, with Csontos even taking photos of the area, but this idea was later abandoned.
After Kisléta, the gang planned to attack Ipolytarnóc on August 23, but this was thwarted by their arrest on August 21. This planned attack was confirmed after the seizure of satellite and other recordings, indicating they were going to attack a Roma-populated house in the town. During these seizures, police also uncovered evidence that they had planned to strike in Erdőkertes, Kisvárda and Tura.
General characteristics of the attacks.
The initial attacks were mainly on buildings inhabited by Roma people, with the aim of causing fear and confusion. In comparison, the 2008 Nagycsécs attack marked a turning point in the case when press coverage gave confirmation to the perpetrators. In the subsequent attacks, they typically turned against gypsies with a more ordinary way of life, with the aim of heightening tensions between the Roma and the non-Roma. For this reason, the gang accepted István Csontos as a driver due to increased police presence on the streets.
In total, the gang attacked 10 villages and towns and 55 people, killing six and injuring five.
Investigation.
During the investigation, police inspected one and a half million cars and millions of phone calls, as well as reviewing 800 hours worth of surveillance camera footage, lasting roughly a year since the start of the crimes. After the fifth attack in Alsószolca in December 2008, the police concluded that the same perpetrators were responsible for the recent spat of crimes, at which point they started focusing on how and by whom the attacks were committed, as well as who the targets were.
Concerning the Tarnabod attack, three young local Roma youths were charged after they had given false testimony and traces of gunpowder was found on them. However, according to their lawyer, the gunpowder actually originated from the arresting officers, and the boys had never owned a firearm. Six months later, the boys were released and later received monetary compensation for their unjustified detention.
A large part in stopping the actual killers were the cell phone calls made at the time and place of the crimes, as well as matching DNA samples taken from the suspects. Prior to their arrest, Hungarian police sought assistance from the FBI in profiling the perpetrators.
Irregularities in the investigation.
The course of the investigation, especially on-site measures after the attack in Tatárszentgyörgy and the inspection of the storage site, was criticized in several aspects. According to several law enforcement agencies, the first-instance proceedings lasted 28 months because deficiencies in the locations had to be clarified during criminal proceedings.
On May 7, 2009, a forensics team funded by the National and Ethnic Minority Rights Protection Office, the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union and the European Roma Rights Centre was dispatched to Tatárszentgyörgy to collect data, which they would later published in their report titled "The White Booklet". According to the report, after the tragedy, the first people to arrive on the scene were reporters from Dabasi Television, then police and firefighters, with the ambulance coming in last. The fire department falsely determined that a short circuit was the cause of the fire, despite a gas can being found on the spot, and police initially ignored testimony about gunshots sounding through the area. It was also documented that one of the detectives had urinated on a footprint possibly belonging to one of the killers, and some authorities claimed the cartridges had been scattered by the victims themselves.
The Independent Police Complaints Board found that the police had seriously violated the fundamental constitutional rights during the scene: while they had fulfilled their obligation to take action and help prevent an escalation of tensions, they had only partially secured the site. The fire was treated as accidental for more than 10 hours, and after the resignation group and the inspection committee withdrew, no police force remained at the crime scene until a morning inspection began. According to the Board, the reasons for this unprofessional conduct was a lack of ballistic knowledge. During the criminal lawsuit, the judge called the scene "shocking and desperate" because, for example, the ambulance paramedic hadn't noticed that one of the victims had been shot in the head.
Following the Tatárszentgyörgy tragedy, Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány requested a report from the ministries to supervise the police, fire brigade and the hospitals, which later found an abundance of procedural and professional errors had occurred at the crime scene. The Chief Captain of Pest County initiated disciplinary proceedings against the hot-pressed commander and the head of the on-site inspection.
According to leaked telegrams published by WikiLeaks in 2011, staff the American embassy in Budapest commented that the view of Hungarian police was that most of the population were indifferent about the case. A few days after the gang members were arrested, in the last days of August 2009, a document referring to intelligence sources appeared on the Internet detailing the omissions made by the intelligence services. The documents revealed that all three main members had been monitored before the attacks, but their supervision had ceased after they had begun. Since 2004, István Kiss had not only been under close control by the Hajdú-Bihar police department, but at the beginning of 2008, he was noted for preparing to purchase weapons and large quantities of ammunition. The county branch initiated an extension into its secret data collection program, and even informed then-director general Sándor Laborc about it, but the request was rejected by higher-ups. The National Security Committee of the National Assembly found that there was insufficient communication between units from the Office of Natural Security and that the service was uncaring in its handling of extremists under surveillance. In the spring of 2008, despite the request of the Hajdú-Bihar operations officer, the Legal Department never issued a surveillance order on Árpád Kiss or Zsolt Pető, nor did it tighten surveillance on István Kiss, which later on was completely suspended. The committee also established that György Szilvásy and Ádám Ficsor, the successor socialist ministers in charge of the national security services, as well as the former director-general of NBH Sándor Laborc and the acting director-general László Balajti were responsible for this misconduct, with all four resigning from their respective posts. The report also indicted Attorney General Tamás Kovács, but no charges were brought against him. Four former NBH officers were charged with forgery of public documents, and even Csontos' detention officer was prosecuted for providing false testimony because he had denied at the hearing that he had anything to do with the detainee, but all defendants were acquitted of their respective charges.
In connection with the previous surveillance of the perpetrators by the intelligence agencies, Minister of Defense Csaba Hende initiated an investigation into the activities of the KBH during the murders; the results were originally scheduled to remain encrypted until 2020, but were made public on September 4, 2013.
Arrest.
The breakthrough in the case was when the gang's car got stuck in the mud after the attack in Tiszalök, when Árpád Kiss called his girlfriend Évá N. to help take them home. When the phone call was inspected, it was discovered that this same cellular device had been used in proximity to the Galgagyörk and Kisléta crime scenes. A week later, all four suspects were being monitored, and after surveillance determined that the group was planning another attack, it was determined that their arrest couldn't be postponed any longer.
The National Bureau of Investigation and the REBISZ arrested two of the men at the dawn of August 21, 2009, at the Pérenyi Club in Debrecen. The arresting force consisted of 85 officers and hundreds of detectives conducting house searches in 13 locations parallel to the arrests, during which they detained the other two suspects. While examining the detainees' homes and dozens of other locations, 1,916 items were seized: map sketches, the getaway vehicle and the winter tires, boots, cameras, and the weapons, which were found hidden in the Pérenyi Club. Police determined that the attacks had been timed, as the perpetrators had wanted to avoid any civilian injuries. In addition, the stolen weaponry from Besenyszög was also found and confiscated from the Kiss brothers' apartment. As the perpetrators lacked any official permit to handle the weaponry, they were also charged with misuse of firearms and ammunition.
Trial.
The four men were charged with six murders, five attempted murders, reckless endagerment, maiming, armed robbery, theft and misuse of weaponry and ammunition. In addition, it was specifically mentioned that their actions were committed for racist motives. The first trial began on March 25, 2011 at the Budapest District Court. The final verdict was delivered on August 6, 2013, when all four defendants were found guilty on all counts. Árpád Kiss, István Kiss and Zsolt Pető received life terms with 10 years deprivation of civil rights, while István Csontos received a 13-year prison term and 10 years deprivation of civil rights. The four were also required to reimburse the victims' families for 107 million forints. A second trial took hold at the Curia (the forum building for the Supreme Court) in 2016, where the sentences of the convicts were upheld.
Open questions.
Although the manner in which the weapons were stolen was clarified to the smallest detail, the origins of the ammunition were not revealed. On the basis of the indictment, it turned out that there were several acquisitions of weapons and ammunition for which there were no intermediaires or contributors. In addition, the did not operate in isolation from other extremist groups and individuals in Debrecen and elsewhere, although Árpád Kiss gradually distanced himself from them and gradually began to use his phone less and less. It is also known that the accomplice in the initial robbery of the weapons has never been identified.
During the raid in Perényi Club, in addition to the four later defendants, the police also arrested two other persons, Antal R. and László E., on suspicion of aiding and abetting suspected criminals. They were investigated for possible connection to the gang, but in the end, both were released without any charges. This is despite the fact that one of the men, Antal R., was a self-avowed neo-Nazi and had previously served time in the same jail as István Csontos, with his profile matching that of the suspect accomplice in the robbery.
Following the arrests of the accused, an unofficial document leaked which stated that István Kiss had been monitored by the Constitution Protection Office until May 2008. It is unknown how the agency was made aware of the Besenszyög robbery during this period, and as no members of it were questioned during the trial as witnesses nor the indictment mentioned the organization's relationship with the accused, it remains a mystery.
It is also unclear how the perpetrators acquired the necessary finances for the attacks, or whether they had any supporters, helpers or instigators. According to the investigators, Árpád Kiss and his brother, István, and István Csontos each had an income of around 100-120 thousand forints per month, with only Zsolt Pető earning 200 thousand from his two jobs. Thus, it was rightly concluded that, while they could've had enough for the spent ammunition and raw materials used for the Molotov cocktails, it was considered doubtful it would've covered any other expenses associated with the attacks. The members never used their own phones, always using either disposable phones with SIM cards or walkie-talkies. According to the indictment, the ammo used by Pető alone was enough to dry up their income, and this was excluding travel costs for vignettes and fuel.
Cause of events.
Perpetrators' background.
At the time of the attacks, Árpád Kiss was 42, his brother István - 33, Zsolt Pető - 34 and István Csontos, who took part solely in the Tiszalök attack, only 27. The latter two were friends of the brothers.
The investigation determined that none of the defendants suffered from mental illness or any personality disorders that necessitated a mitigation of their sentences.
Motives.
The main motivations of the perpetrators, who described themselves as neo-Nazis and Hungarianists, was retaliation to crimes committed by Roma offenders who, in their view, terrorized the ethnic Hungarian population but always got away with lenient sentences. The Kiss brothers were particularly affected by an infamous case from 2006, when teacher Lajos Szögi was lynched by the relatives of a girl he had almost run over with his car, but then attempted to help. The murder caused outrage in the population, with the brothers joining the National Guard in sympathy, initially believing that the paramilitary organization was suitable for regulating the Roma, taking part in their protest in Pest in 2007. However, they came to the conclusion that the National Guard wasn't strict enough. All three of the main defendants agreed that the state authorities, the judiciaries and the police were doing an improper job in detecting and punishing Roma criminals, and because of this, they had decided to take justice into their own hands.
Commemoration.
In November 2009, the National Gypsy Self-Government placed a memorial plaque at the organization's headquarters on Dóhany Street in Budapest, but it was later removed.
On July 19, 2011, a monument designed by Zoltán Nagygyörgy and Ádám Márk Horváth, and funded by Csepel and ARC, was revealed at the Gödör Club in Budapest, to commemorate the victims of the murders and to emphasize the peaceful coexistence of ethnic Hungarians and Roma Hungarians. The monument was exhibited at the Valley of the Arts in Kapolcs, at the Vidor Festival in Nyíregyháza, and at the Sziget Festival and Millenáris Park in Budapest.
The murders inspired the plot of the 2012 film "Just the Wind", directed by Benedek Fliegauf. Eszter Hajdú made a documentary about the case entitled "Judgment in Hungary"; it later won the 2014 jury grand prize at the Open City Docs in London.
After the first fatal attack had occurred, on November 3, 2018, the local Roma government inaugurated a memorial plaque in memory of the Nagy couple in Nagycsécs. On February 23, 2019, a civil commemoration in honor of the victims of the Tatárszentgyörgy attack was held in Budapest. Participants gathered at Pope John Paul II Square and then, after delivering their speeches, marched together toward the Deák Square Lutheran Church, where worship services were held.
On March 28, 2019, Gergely Karácsony, the mayor of Zugló, forwarded a motion to rename Mexikói Street to Robiká Csorba Street. As the family wished to discuss this more widely, he withdrew the motion at their request on April 29.
In a debate held during the second round of the 2019 Budapest municipal elections, candidates Olga Kálmán, Gábor Kerpel-Fronius and Gergely Karácsony all stated that they would support the erection of a memorial to the murder victims in Budapest.
Renewal and reopening of the investigation.
At the end of 2018, Árpád Kiss asked for a retrial, basing his appeal off the incorrect information provided in the Tiszalök case, which would redefine his guilt from that of a main perpetrator to accomplice, thus reducing his sentence. This was rejected by the Metropolitan Judgement Board on March 28, 2019. In the retrial request, Árpád Kiss claimed that he hadn't handled a gun during the murder of Jenö Kóka, but that it was his brother, István, who had pulled the trigger and that his footprint hadn't been recorded by authorities; he also alleged that the shooting of the Debrecen refugee camp wasn't done by him but by Zsolt Petö, and that he had been at his workplace at the time. He raised his younger brother's confession as new evidence, however, according to the reasoning of the panel, the new evidence must be capable of establishing a new fact not present in the judgment, which in itself could make the accused likely to get an acquittal or lesser sanction. Since procedural positions cannot be accumulated and charged persons unable to be heard as witnesses, his motion was denied.
At the beginning of March 2020, the press reported for the first time that the main defendant, Árpád Kiss, wished for a new trial concerning the Roma murders. In his view, the role of the socialist government and the secret services hadn't been properly clarified in previous proceedings. Kiss complained that the reasons for the events (social tension between the gypsies and Hungarians, as well as open coverage as crimes committed by gypsies) were all due to activities encouraged by the government at the time, and that the National Guard and the Sixty-Four Counties Youth Movement had moles who encouraged the acquisition of weapons and the extermination of gypsies, a fact confirmed by the latter organization. According to Kiss, the ethnic conflict was blown up by people with a background in the secret services in 2008 in Galgagyörk, as a result of which they had begun to "settle in", espousing slogans reminiscent of one used by the services. He also claimed that the first killing taking place in the same village was no coincidence, alleging that it was all planned in advance by the Constitution Protection Office, who had already admitted that they had monitored István Kiss, but had withheld his files. This general phenomenon, in his view, was caused by the Gyurcsány government's desire to divert people's attention from the country's poor economic situation, anti-government sentiment and impending election defeat for the Hungarian Socialist Party.
Árpád Kiss also requested an re-examination of István Csontos' role in the murders, as well as people related to him, citing his service in Kosovo and later employment by the Military Security Office and constant contact with his detaining officer, whom he had met in person before the last attack in Kisléta. To date, it hasn't been revealed exactly what the two men had conversed about nor whether Csontos' officer, Ernö Hódos, reported to his supervisor about the meeting. Kiss also requested that the investigators find out why Csontos had been let go from the scene and arrested hours later. István himself later claimed that the police interrogation had been a simple mistake.
In May 2020, the National Bureau of Investigation confirmed that it was conducting a new investigation into the alleged fifth member, and that it was seeking information for any potential instigators, financiers or other accomplices. The reopening of the investigation is presumably related to the new information provided by Árpád Kiss, albeit it remains unclear whether specific people have been eyed as potential suspects.

Lewiston and Youngstown Frontier Electric Railway

The Lewiston &amp; Youngstown Frontier Electric Railway connected the villages of Lewiston and Youngstown in Niagara County, New York. 
Company.
The company was set-up by a number of local capitalists in the summer of 1895. After a number of surveys the railroad was finally located through private property between these villages, about one-quarter of a mile easterly from the River Road, thus avoiding the destruction of property along the banks of the lower Niagara River, or occupying the highway.
Route.
The contract for the construction of the roadbed, ballasting, overhead work and fencing was let April 12, 1896, to Craige &amp; Tench, Buffalo, New York, for the sum of $63,500. The railroad started from the New York Central depot at Lewiston and ran up Center street to 5th street. Then it ran northerly through 5th street to the village limits, then through private lands to 3rd street, Youngstown, then through Church street to Main street and to the United States Military Reservation, at the mouth of the Niagara River. There was also a branch in Lewiston from 5th street through Onondaga street to the New York Central freight station and a branch in Youngstown to the docks. The road was long in all. 
The country through which this road ran is extremely level and is in the heart of the Niagara fruit district, being largely devoted to the culture of apples, peaches and grapes. The right of way is in width and fenced throughout its entire length between the villages. There were no structures whatever on the line, with the exception of a few wooden box culverts and one trestle long and about high. 
Track.
The road was single track of and had five turnouts in the course of the line with end switches at each end. In the two villages the track was laid with girder rails, of 67-lb/yard (32.5 kg/m) and of 87-lb/yard (43.5 kg/m) and in the country for with 56-lb/yard (27.7kg/m) T-rails. The Johnson Company furnished the rails and track fastenings and all the rails except the 87-lb/yard (43.5 kg/m) girders which were rolled by the Pennsylvania Steel Company. The ties were of cedar, x , spaced between centers. The line was ballasted with 
broken stone which was deep under the ties. 
Electrification.
R. W. Oliver furnished the overhead work at a cost of $9,750. In the villages span work was used and in the country side pole bracket work. The trolley wire was No. 00 and there were nearly of No. 0000 stranded triple covered feed wire starting from Lewiston and reaching nearly to Youngstown. All poles and fence posts were painted olive green. 
No power plant was constructed by this company, because power could be obtained from the plant of the Niagara Falls &amp; Power Company, which was situated away from Lewiston. It was generated by one of the 1.000-h.p. generators situated in the new power house at the foot of the cliff at a voltage of 550 Volts. This was raised to 750 volts by being passed through a booster and was conveyed to Lewiston over a 500,000 circular mil stranded copper wire triple covered. This wire was strung on the poles of the Niagara Gorge Railroad and thus brought to Lewiston, where it was connected with the trolley and feed wire.
Rolling stock.
The equipment consisted of four, eight bench open motor cars and two closed combination baggage and passenger cars seating 16 people, made by the J. G. Brill Company, Philadelphia. The combination cars had a vestibule on the passenger end, and the baggage compartment, which was long, had sliding doors on each side and three drop sash in the front end allowing the motorman to occupy the baggage compartment when running that end forward, but there was no vestibule. All these cars are equipped with Brill eureka maximum traction trucks, with diameter wheels. Each truck was equipped with one G.E. 1,000 motor, thus giving each car horizontal tractive pull. The 
total cost of roadway, equipment, transmission line, land 
damages, etc., amounted to very nearly $100,000.
Operation.
After a number of delays, owing to the non-arrival of material, etc., the road was informally opened the latter part of August, 1896. The company contemplated a freight as well as a passenger service, and was handling about 10 cars of freight per day in 1897, beside package freight. A steady passenger traffic was maintained between the points mentioned, which increased during the summer. 
When the Niagara Gorge Railroad was taken out of use in 1935, the Lewiston &amp; Youngstown Frontier Electric Railway remained in service as a diesel freight line.
Personnel.
The officers of the company were:
The engineering work was led by Paul Voorhes of Buffalo. He constructed other rails, among them Buffalo &amp; Williamsville Electric Railway and the Buffalo, Gardenville &amp; Ebenezer Railway.

<doc id="56992169" url="?curid=56992169" title="Hedjhotep">
Hedjhotep

Hedjhotep (also Hedj-hotep from "ḥḏ-ḥtp") was a minor ancient Egyptian deity, a god of fabrics and clothes and, to a lesser extent, of weaving and the deceased. Hedjhotep is sometimes described as a goddess rather than a god, holding a wadj-scepter and ankh sign.
He possibly originated from the northern part of Middle Egypt.
The earliest attestations of Hedjhotep date back to the Twelfth Dynasty of the Middle Kingdom, when he appears in spells of the Coffin Texts including spells 779 and 908.
A cult center of Hedjhotep might have existed at the time east of the Faiyum in el Lahun. It is in nearby Harageh that archaeological excavations unearthed the only stele known to be dedicated explicitly to Hedjhotep, stele AEIN 1540, from the tomb of a man named Nebipu who held the titles of "libationer" and "keeper of clothing". The onomastic of individuals who lived in the region of Heracleopolis Magna during the Middle Kingdom indicates that Hedjhotep then benefitted from a growing cult and dedicated priesthood. In spite of this, Hedjhotep does not seem to have been honoured by dedicated priests in subsequent periods of Ancient Egyptian history, during which he appears only sporadically on sarcophagi and liturgical contexts centered on rituals devoted to the king.
In parallel with these developments, the New Kingdom sees Hedjhotep being given medicinal roles. He is invoked with Shezmu, the god of the preparation of unguents, in the treatment of headache and stomach-ache, and in the making of amulets where he is in charge of their cords. Another papyrus of the same time period presents Hedjhotep as a dichotomy: beneficial as a god of clothing but harmful as a deity who committed an offence against Montu, possibly running away with one of his divine wives or having forced a sexual relation on him similar to what happens in "The Contendings of Horus and Seth". From this time onwards, Hedjhotep is often associated with a goddess of weaving named Tayt as well as with Renenutet.
Hedjhotep is more frequently honoured during the Late Period, Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman period, when he is shown replacing Horus as the son of Isis in scenes of cloth-offerings. The latest period sees the development of a syncretism with the god Shu, making of Hedjhotep a son of Ra and the first to have dressed the naked, having invented clothing. Hedjhotep nonetheless remains primarily the god who creates the clothes of the king, the gods and the deceased, thereby stimulating their resurrection.

Somatemps

Somatemps is a collective in Catalonia generally considered to be aligned with the far-right of Spain and also of being Spanish nationalist. They state to be committed to defend what they call "the hispanic identity of Catalonia". It was founded between 2011 and November 16, 2013 in Santpedor (Bages), where one of its founders, Josep Ramon Bosch, resides. The organisation is led by Javier Barraycoa. Currently Somatemps has around 300 members. The name of Somatemps was intended as word-play between ""—"we are in time" (to stop independentism)—and the medieval Catalan militias . Somatemps has contributed to the creation of the association Catalan Civil Society.
History.
The first meeting of the entity was attended by both leaders of Platform for Catalonia (PxC) and the Republican Social Movement (MSR) with Juan Antonio Llopart, referents to Spain of parties such as the Greek Golden Dawn or the British National Party (BNP) and fascist movements such as Casa Pound. Somatemps is considered a far-right organization as per police and press sources.
Josep Alsina, who succeeded Bosch in Somatemps, when he was young he had been a member of the NSSP, the National Socialist Spanish Party or PENS, Partido Español Nacional Socialista in Spanish. PENS is a neo-Nazi organization created in Barcelona in 1970 and that had strong links with the secret services of the Superior Center of Defense Information (SECED), to the point that he could pay a local and print large runs of Nazi propaganda. The PENS came to commit attacks against bookstores, cinemas and theaters or distributors of books and publishing houses. Alsina also relates Jorge Buxadé Villalba, who has publicly acknowledged being a member of Catalan Civil Society, and who attended the 7th nomination of Falange Española de las Juntas de Ofensiva Nacional-Sindicalista ("FE de las JONS") for Tarragona in the 1995 Catalan elections. Buxadé also became a State Attorney in September 2009, under the orders of the Spanish Government, when he challenged the consultation on the independence of Catalonia held in Arenys de Munt.
Somatemps also received the help of the lawyer Ariadna Hernández, at that time coordinating VOX in the demarcation of Barcelona and partner of one of the main drivers of the neofascist Casal Tramuntana, the councilor of PxC in l'Hospitalet de Llobregat Alberto Sánchez. Journalist Xavier Rius has even come to the point that Catalan Civil Society has had contacts with which he was delegated from the Spanish government in Catalonia, María de los Llanos de Luna, contacts but Bosch denies insistently despite the fact that there are photographs of the meeting.
The entity organized in December 2013 in Ripoll the 1st Congress of Spanish Catalanity in which the ex democratic socialist Joaquim Coll (member of Catalan Civil Society) and the People's Party Fernando Sánchez-Costa participated. He was also organizing protests in front of the Convergence and Union headquarters for the Pujol case, which was joined by Platform for Catalonia (PxC) before Parliament for the same reason.
Entities like "Spain and Catalans" in 2012 and "Som Catalunya, Som Espanya" in 2013, had wanted to publicly commemorate the Hispanic Day in Barcelona, but they did not manage to concentrate a sufficiently large attendance. Somatemps tried to take over the relief by convening the founding assembly on April 26 at the Poblet Monastery. A few days ago, an event had already been held in Barcelona where the presentation of the Catalan Civil Society was attended by, among others, the extreme right of Santiago Abascal, general secretary of the new Vox and Borja García-Nieto, the president of the Equestrian Circle. Somatemps did not adhere to the rally on October 12 in Barcelona although they were present.
In the context of the Spanish constitutional crisis and before the 1-O Catalan independence referendum of 2017, Somatemps participated in the so-called "ham operation" which sent 25 kg of Iberian ham and boxes of Rioja wine to the Spanish police and Civil Guard agents summoned in Barcelona by the Spanish government. The agents were allocated in hotels and ships docked in Barcelona's seaport. Somatemps organized a donation campaign which obtained around 2.500 euros of funds for the symbolic operation. Other actions in which Somatemps has participated involved bringing food to the policemen.
On November 18, 2017 Somatemps participated in a far-right demonstration supporting the Spanish unionism. This demonstration opposed a demonstration call made by Unit Against Fascism and Racism.
Political Agenda.
This organisation is of Spanish Nationalist nature. They believe that a constitution is irrelevant for Spain, and despise the concepts of freedom and social equality expressed in the current constitution. They promote a Spain formed by a single political nation, alluding to what they believe was the old Spanish Empire. By proposing a single political nation, they deny the existence of national and regional identities in Spain and their corresponding political movements. This means they pursue some sort of imperialism with a single political nation ruling over the rest. In consequence, they are positioned against Catalan Nationalism.
Catalan education system which makes extensive use of Catalan as tuition language is also against Somatemps doctrine. Somatemps claims that pupils in Catalonia are indoctrinated into Catalan nationalism, something which multiple studies have refuted, identifying as main factors parental and neighbourhood influence. Other points which Somatemps defend to support Spanish Nationalism is to point out a supposed Catalan history revisionism.
Somatemps opposes to policies and campaigns aiding immigrants, including those from Red Cross and Plataforma per la Llengua which promote the learning of Catalan language among immigrants with the purpose of improving equality of opportunities.
Somatemps supports political catholicism, positioning the Catholic Church as a part of their view of a Spanish nation. LGBT campaigns are belittled as an offence to their religious sentiments. In their blog they have criticised the pride parade for indecency, published texts deeming laws which protect the LGBT group as unnecessary and indoctrinating, and texts against same-sex marriage and abortion.

Peace and Justice

Members group of Peace and Justice (), or Peace and Justice () for short, is a South Korean parliamentary grouping that was formed on 2 April 2018. The technical group consists of Party for Democracy and Peace and Justice Party.
History.
Both Democracy and Peace and Justice were non-parliamentary groups in South Korea, due to the law requiring at least 20 members to form a parliamentary group. Democracy and Peace and Justice, with 14 and 6 members of the National Assembly respectively, chose to form a parliamentary group to bolster their voices in the National Assembly after rounds of negotiations. The grouping became the fourth parliamentary group after Democratic Party of Korea, Liberty Korea Party and Bareunmirae Party. The grouping was automatically dissolved with the death of Justice Party lawmaker Roh Hoe-chan on July 23rd, falling below the 20-member requirement.

Breffu

Breffu was an Akwamu leader of the 1733 slave insurrection on St. John (then known as "St. Jan") in Danish West Indies. She committed suicide with 23 other rebels to evade capture as the rebellion weakened in 1734.
St Jan Slave Insurrection.
Breffu was enslaved at a plantation owned by Pieter Krøyer, and lived in Coral Bay. On 23 November 1733, hearing the signal of a cannon fired from Fort Fredericksvaern, Breffu entered the main house and killed both Krøyer and his wife. Taking all gunpowder and ammunition, and accompanied by fellow slave Christian, Breffu then proceeded to the Van Stell family house, where she killed three members of the plantation owner's family.
Some slave masters were able to get off the island on boats and the Akwamu people gained control of most of the territory. Under the leadership of Breffu, the plan of taking over the plantations was successful until the early part of 1734, when the French collaborated with the Danes to take back the island.
She committed suicide to evade capture, and is thought to have died in either April or May of 1734. Her body was discovered at Browns Bay, along with another 23 rebels who committed suicide, at which a plantation owner recorded his surprise that, "one of the leaders of the rebellion, Baeffu, whom none of us knew, and whom we assumed to be a man having murdered my son Pieter Krøyer and his wife, is a woman!"
In popular culture.
Breffu has been dramatised as the "Queen of St John" in the play "Three Queens Chautauqua Series: Act I Queen Breffu". In a 2006 production, Breffu was portrayed by the academic Jaweh David. She has also featured as a subject in festival floats at St John celebrations.

FX Airguns

FX Airguns AB is a Swedish manufacturer of air rifles based in Mariestad, Västra Götaland. Founded by Fredrik Axelsson in 1999, the company is famous for its extensive line of competition and hunting pre-charged pneumatic (PCP) rifles.
FX Airguns is known in the industry for its proprietary "Smooth Twist" barrels, which uses hybrid riflings with a long smoothbore portion and press-forged slow-twist riflings near the muzzle. FX later introduced the "Smooth Twist X" barrels in 2017, which allow the user to easily switch barrels of different calibers and a different twist rates. FX air rifles are also known for innovative features such as the interchangeable air tubes and the power adjuster wheel, as well as the ability to shoot arrows in some models. The company is one of the first manufacturers to produce modular airguns.
In 2020, FX Airguns employee Philip Jönsson won the gold medal in the mixed 10m air rifle standing SH2 event at the 2020 Summer Paralympics held in Tokyo, Japan. Philip is the first athlete with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy to win a Paralympic gold medal.
History.
Fredrik Axelsson had been an avid airgun enthusiast since he started shooting since 5 years of age. At the end of 1989, he started making things for airguns after being disappointed by an English-made .22 caliber spring-piston air rifle he purchased for shooting pigeons in a tree, with which he had done very little actual shooting because the spring broke after a couple of months. As a result, Axelsson made his own gas ram, but he didn't like the recoil despite it worked quite well. He then started experimenting and making other kinds of airguns, including a 9mm CO2 rifle and a 20-gauge air shotgun with replaceable chokes. After experimenting with pump pneumatic rifles, Axelsson then moved to develop PCP rifles.
In 1994, Axelsson came up with the original design for the Independence rifle. As there wasn't a lot of SCUBA diving activities in Sweden, one of the problems needed to be addressed was the difficulty finding gas cylinders to recharge the rifles. Axelsson developed with a three-stage hand pump that alleviated this difficulty of refilling PCP airguns. In 1995, he took the ideas to a local company and started production of the hand pump. He then took the pump off the Independence rifle and sold it to Webley &amp; Scott, which later became the Webley Axsor rifle. Around the same time, he also made the Timberwolf rifle.
Axelsson's partnership with that company ended in May 1999, when he resigned without taking any of his patents and went on to create FX Airguns, his own company. After Webley &amp; Scott agreed to a manufacturing contract on the condition that any new products FX developed must fit into the Axsor stocks, Axelsson made the FX2000. In 2000, Axelsson came up with a patent on a new pump and an electrical air compressor, followed by the Cyclone rifle in 2001.
In 2001, Axelsson considered entering the American market, as the American regulations for airguns are less restrictive and there was already a sizeable enthusiast population in North America. He contacted American airgun collector Ingvar Alm for advice, who recommended the retailer Airguns of Arizona. AOA's president Robert Buchanan agreed to have samples of the FX2000 and the Excalibur rifles, and was very impressed by the rifle's accuracy and light weight (due to Axelsson's design of light hammers striking small valves). Axelsson was also unhappy with his Italian supplier of stocks at the time, so FX started to build their own machines that would make the synthetic stocks they wanted. FX's venture into the North American markets has been a great success, and in 2009 Axelsson decided to shift the company's main focus to America due to the commercial freedom and more innovation-friendly consumer mindset compared to markets in Europe.
In 2005, after having some issues with barrels supplied by other contractors, Axelsson decided that the company need to make their own barrels, and started developing a smoothbore-rifled bore combination design, which later became the company's proprietary "Smooth Twist" rifling. After showing his project to British airgun specialist Ben Taylor in 2007, Taylor gave him Axelsson the idea of making the rifling by impressing the barrel from the outside, which allowed FX to make quality barrels fast.
In 2012, Axelsson used the FX Boss air rifle to win the annual Extreme Benchrest competition (sponsored by Airguns of Arizona) held at Green Valley, Arizona, where 4 others out of the top 10 competitors also used FX air rifles. Since then, FX air rifles have become increasingly popular among competition shooters, with nearly 3/4 of the top 20 Extreme Benchrest competitors in both "Pro" and "Sportsman" classes using FX airguns in 2017.

Gu Hui

Gu Hui ( 200s), courtesy name Zitan, was an official serving under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was a younger brother of Gu Yong, the second Imperial Chancellor of the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan in the Three Kingdoms period.
Life.
Gu Hui was from Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. His great-grandfather Gu Feng (顧奉) was a former Administrator (太守) of Yingchuan Commandery (潁川郡; around present-day Xuchang, Henan). He was a younger brother of Gu Yong; they were also born to the same mother. In his youth, he travelled around for studies and was known for his oratorical talent.
In the year 200, after Sun Quan succeeded his brother Sun Ce as the warlord ruling over the Jiangdong territories, he heard of Gu Hui's talent and recruited him to serve as his Registrar (主簿).
One day, while taking a stroll in town, Gu Hui saw soldiers escorting a man to the town square for a public execution. After learning that the man was to be executed for stealing 100 coins, he asked them to delay the execution while he rushed to Sun Quan's office to plead for the man's life. He said: "As we are growing our population in preparation for war in the north, we should see this man as someone who can be a soldier. Besides, the amount of money he stole is a small amount. I humbly plead for him to be spared." Sun Quan was so pleased that he approved Gu Hui's request. He then reassigned Gu Hui to work in the east bureau of his office.
Around 204, when Sun Quan received news that the northern warlord Cao Cao was planning to attack the Jiangdong region, he told Gu Hui: "You are someone I trust. Recently, I heard that Cao Cao has the intention of attacking us. I need someone to confirm this. I will send you on this mission." He then commissioned Gu Hui as a Commandant Who Upholds Righteousness (輔義都尉) and sent him as an emissary to meet Cao Cao.
When Cao Cao asked him about the situation in Jiangdong, Gu Hui told him that Jiangdong was a prosperous region. He also told Cao Cao that the Shanyue tribes, who were known for being hostile towards Sun Quan's administration, had been pacified and were even willing to serve in Sun Quan's army. Cao Cao laughed and said: "I have marital ties with Sun Quan. We are now in the same family so we should work together to support the Han dynasty. Why are you telling me all this?" Gu Hui replied: "It is precisely because you, Wise Lord, and my lord have such strong ties and a shared loyalty towards the Han dynasty. I know that you would definitely want to know what is happening in Jiangdong. That is why I decided to tell you." Cao Cao treated Gu Hui generously and sent him back to Jiangdong.
After Gu Hui returned to Jiangdong, Sun Quan asked him what he found out, and so Gu Hui replied: "It is indeed very difficult to assess the intentions of a rival state. However, based on the intelligence I gathered, I know that Cao Cao is at war with Yuan Tan. He has no other designs at the moment."
Sun Quan later appointed Gu Hui as the nominal Administrator of Badong Commandery (巴東郡; around present-day Chongqing), which was not under his control. He also planned to entrust Gu Hui with greater responsibilities, but Gu Hui died shortly after.
Family.
Gu Hui's elder brother, Gu Yong, served as the second Imperial Chancellor of the state of Eastern Wu founded by Sun Quan in the Three Kingdoms period after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty.
Gu Hui's son, Gu Yu (顧裕), had the courtesy name Jize (季則). Already well known since he was a youth, Gu Yu served in the Eastern Wu government and the highest position he held was General Who Guards the East (鎮東將軍).

San Jorde de Ojeda

San Jorde de Ojeda, also known as San Jorde, is an ancient, currently unoccupied, Spanish settlement in the province of Palencia (Castile and León autonomous community) in North-Western Spain.
 It belongs to the municipality of Prádanos de Ojeda.
Etymology.
The name San Jorde is a variation of the spelling of San Jorge (Saint George in English)
History.
The village of San Jorde once consisted of around five houses, a fountain and a small church. The church was constructed in the 13th century and remained in a good state of repair until 1975 when it was targeted by vandals and thieves who removed the Roman windows, the roof and large amounts of stone. The spire atop the building remains intact. Parts of the fountain still remain, but the ruins of the houses have largely disappeared.
Current status.
Following the abandonment of the settlement, only the ruins of the church remain. The ruins are listed in the Spanish "Lista Roja" of elements of Spanish heritage to be protected.

SYML is the solo venture of Brian Fennell who was previously part of the indie band Barcelona. SYML released his eponymous debut album on May 3, 2019 through Nettwerk Records.
Life and career.
Brian Fennell was born on January 16, 1983 in Issaquah, Washington. After living in several places in and around Seattle, he's since returned to his hometown and lives there currently where he writes and produces out of a home studio.
Fennell started playing piano at a young age, and wrote his first song when he was 18 years old as a coping mechanism after the death of a schoolmate. After high school, he attended Seattle Pacific University where he got a degree in Music Education with an emphasis in percussion.
Fennell currently performs under the solo project SYML. It means “simple” in Welsh, and is pulled from his own personal heritage. He was adopted as a child, and later in life found out that his biological parents are Welsh. His experience grappling with both his adoption and heritage are influences in his songwriting.
After his song "Where's My Love" was used on the popular drama TV show "Teen Wolf", the song charted for 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart. In 2018, the song received Gold certification in Canada and Belgium, and held the #1 spot on Canada's CBC Top 20 charts twice. SYML's "Wildfire" also appeared in a Belgian teen drama web series wtFOCK (broadcast by VIER and VIJF 2018 - so far) - an adaption of the popular Norwegian series SKAM. "Where's My Love" was also featured prominently in the official trailer for the 2018 motion picture "Adrift." SYML's three singles "Where's My Love", "Fear of Water" and "Body" were featured in an American Supernatural Drama Television series, Shadowhunters. In 2020, the song appeared in the movie Chemical Hearts.
In 2019, SYML's fan favorite cover of the classic "Mr. Sandman" was featured in the short film TIM (The Invisible Me) by writer/director John Grammatico. TIM Short Film

Ponerorchis tominagae

Ponerorchis tominagae is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native to Taiwan.
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Bunzō Hayata in 1916 as "Gymnadenia tominagae". Hayata stated that the plant he described was collected by T. Tominaga. He spelt the specific epithet as "tominagai", and this spelling has been used by some subsequent authors when transferring the species to a different genus. However, the "International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants" requires names not published in a form specified by the code to be corrected to conform to it, and personal names ending in "-a", even if the person is a man, should have an epithet in the genitive case formed by adding "-e". The epithet is thus correctly spelt "tominagae".
The species has been transferred to several genera: to "Amitostigma" (now included in "Ponerorchis"), to "Orchis", and in 2000, to "Ponerorchis". Several other species have been brought into synonymy with "Ponerorchis tominagae".

William H. Nobles

William H. Nobles (1816 – December 28, 1876) was an U.S military officer, Treasury Agent, businessman, politician and trailblazer
Nobles was born in Genesee County, New York. He moved to Wisconsin Territory in 1841 and settled in St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin Territory. He then moved to Hudson, Wisconsin Territory where he is credited with building the first wood-frame house. He then moved across the river to Stillwater, Wisconsin Territory where he is credited with involvement of building the first gristmill. In 1848, Nobles settled in Saint Paul, Wisconsin Territory. He established a blacksmith wagon building business on Robert Street and was a machinist. In 1849 Nobles headed to Shasta, California where "he and Peter Lassen explored Honey Lake Valley in search of the legendary Gold Lake in 1851. When they failed to find Gold Lake, Lassen returned, but Nobles continued eastward, accidentally scouting a shorter trail into California. The Nobles Trail was a wagon route between Black Rock Desert in Nevada and the gold mining town of Shasta City in California." "The Nobles Trail proved to be one of the easiest of all the wagon routes into northern California and saw heavy use" until the transcontinental railway made wagon trails obsolete.
Nobles returned to Minnesota and the Territorial Governor Alexander Ramsey named him County surveyor for the newly created Scott County. He then ran for office and became Scott County surveyor, register of deeds and auditor. On top of that he was elected to the 5th Territorial Legislature as a representative for the 6th district. From 1854 to 1856, Nobles served in the Minnesota Territorial House of Representatives. He also served on the Saint Paul City Council in 1855 and 1856. His brick home was in the middle of Rice Street on the Como Road. He was named superintendent of construction for a wagon road for the Department of Interior from Fort Ridgely to south pass Nebraska Territory. This project was not completed for lack of departmental support. In 1859 Nobles put together an expedition in St. Paul to break a trail to Fraser River country in British Columbia where gold had been found. When he reached the Saskatchewan river he turned back even with Pierre Bottineau in his group.
When the Civil War broke out Nobles returned to his native New York where he served in the 79th New York Volunteer Infantry as a Lt. Colonel. The 79th was an element of 2nd Brigade of T. W. Sherman's Expeditionary Corps in South Carolina. On 3 December 1861 Nobles resigned his commission and General Thomas W. Sherman appointed him to collect and sell the abandoned cotton in Hilton Head and the Sea Islands for the Treasury Department. The U.S. was to get 94% of the sale with Nobles receiving the remaining 6%. By 24 December 1861 he had sold $30,000 worth of cotton. Once all the abandoned cotton had been sold he became a revenue collector and quartermaster responsible for troop transportation around Mobile.
Post-war his health failed and even though his rank had been Lt. Colonel he was referred to as "Colonel". He moved to Waukesha Springs, Wisconsin for his health and then Hot Springs, Colorado. He died in Saint Paul shortly after he returned to Minnesota. Nobles County, Minnesota was named in his honor. The Fort Ridgely wagon road Nobles pioneered passed through the eastern third of what became Nobles County.

Bergwacht

The Bergwacht is an organisation that is part of the German Red Cross (DRK-Bergwacht), whose primary functions are mountain rescue and nature conservation. The voluntary organisation provides over 90% of the emergency services in the impassable terrain of the German Central Upland and Alpine regions.
By contrast the Austrian "Berg- und Naturwachten Österreichs" purely looks after nature conservation and the environment leaving Alpine rescue in the hands of the Austrian Mountain Rescue Service ("Österreichischer Bergrettungsdienst").
Objectives.
The objectives of the Bergwacht are multi-faceted:
Save life:
Nature conservation:
History.
The first German mountain rescue service existed in Saxony as early as 1912. It consisted of the Samaritan department of the Saxon Mountaineering Association. 
In 1920, Munich men founded a German mountain rescue service with the aim of restoring order, custom and decency in the mountains. The rather desolate conditions in the mountains after the First World War, with poaching, theft of huts, cattle and wood, prompted the founders to join forces to "protect the mountain from the people". 
A short time later, the Red Cross founded the Mountain Accident Service (GUD), an association of Red Cross paramedics. 
By 1923, the mountain rescue service, or Bergwacht, already comprised three departments, Munich, Allgäu and Chiemgau. The Bergwacht was entrusted with the task of providing "on the spot help for alpine rescue services". 
With the annexation of Austria in 1938, the Austrian rescue organisations also merged into the German Bergwacht. In 1939, the Bergwacht was also entrusted with nature conservation. In the further course of the Second World War the mountain rescue men were sworn in as auxiliary policemen. In 1944, the Bergwacht was placed under military authority. 
After the end of the Second World War, the Bergwacht was disbanded in the US occupation zone. The departments joined the respective regional associations of the German Red Cross. In the French occupation zone, the authorities approved the establishment of the independent Black Forest Bergwacht. 
In 1955, the Bergwacht state associations joined forces at federal level to form a working group. From this the Federal Committee for Mountain Rescue of the German Red Cross (DRK) emerged. The Black Forest Bergwacht was represented on this committee as a corporate member. 
Today the mountain rescue service is a member of the International Commission for Alpine Mountain Rescue or IKAR.
Organisation and state associations.
The organisation of the Bergwacht is aligned to that of the German Red Cross. For example, the Bergwacht operates as part of the eleven DRK state associations. The Black Forest Mountain Rescue Service (Bergwacht Schwarzwald or BWS) has a special status. The BWS is a corporate member of the DRK State Association of the Baden Red Cross and at the same time an independent association and looks after mountain rescue on the territory of the Baden Red Cross (Black Forest).

Soviet Baltic Sea submarine campaign in 1944

The Soviet submarine Baltic Sea campaign in 1944 was launched by the Soviet Navy to harass enemy shipping and naval military assets of the Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front during World War II. 
Background.
After the failed offensive of the previous year, Soviets restrained for a further campaign until Finland signed the Moscow Armistice on 9 September 1944, ceasing war with Soviet Union and starting hostilities with Germany (Lapland War). This move, enabled the Soviet Navy to avoid the mine field barrages in the Gulf of Finland that caused heavy losses in 1942 and prevented success in 1943. Submarines ShCh-310, ShCh-318 and ShCh-407 were the first to operate in open Baltic from Finnish harbors and navigating out of the dangerous zones with aid of Finnish naval officers, they were soon followed by other 12 submarines.
On 8 September (before the actual offensive), Soviet submarine M-96 sunk by mine in the Narva Bay. It was the only Soviet submarine loss in 1944. 
Engagements.
On 6 October, Soviet submarine ShCh-407 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Nordstern " (1127 GRT) west of Klaipeda. 
On 8 October, Soviet submarine ShCh-310 torpedoed and sunk the German dredger "Bagger 3" (400 GRT) and shortly later torpedoed and sunk the German transport ship "Ro-24"(4499 GRT), west of Ventspils. 
On 9 October, Soviet submarine S-13 damaged with gunfire the German fishing vessel Siegfried (563 GRT) north of Danzig Bay. 
On 12 October, Soviet submarine S-4 torpedoed and sunk German fishing vessel "Taunus" (218 GRT) off the Stolpebank. 
On 13 October, Soviet submarine S-4 torpedoed and sunk German tanker "Terra" (1533 GRT) north-east of Leba. On the same day, Soviet submarine Lembit torpedoed and sunk the German merchant "Hilma Lau" (2414 GRT) north-east of Bornholm. 
On 15 October, Soviet submarine Lembit torpedoed and sunk the German auxiliary minesweeper M-3619 "Crabeels". 
On 10 November, Soviet submarine ShCh-309 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Carl Cords" (903 GRT) north-west of Ventspils. 
On 21 November, Soviet submarine L-21 after having laid a field of mines, attacked and sunk with torpedo the neutral Swedish passenger-ship Hansa (563 GRT) north-west of Halskuk. 
On 28 November, Soviet submarine K-51 sunk with gunfire the German fishing boat "Sollind" (260 GRT). 
On 1 December, Soviet submarine K-51 sunk with gunfire the German fishing boat "Saar" (235 GRT). 
On 4 December, Soviet submarine ShCh-407 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Seeburg" (12181 GRT) inside Danzig Bay
On 7 December, Soviet submarine ShCh-309 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Nordenham" (4592 GRT)north-west of Uzava. 
On 26 December, Soviet submarine K-56 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Baltenland" (3038 GRT) off the Polish north coast. 
On 29 December, Soviet submarine K-56 torpedoed and sunk Swedish merchant "Venersborg" (1046 GRT) off Bornholm.
Minelaying operations.
Between October and December 1944, the Soviet Navy employed also the three left submarines (L-3, L-21 and Lembit) capable of minelaying operations in offensive actions, laying 77 mines.
On 11 October, Submarine L-3 laid a field of mines off Cape Arkona. These mines hit the following ships:
On 11 October, Submarine Lembit laid mines off Kolberg. These mines hit the following ships:
Another field laid on 3 December is not known to have scored successes. 
On 23 November, Submarine L-21 laid a field of mines off Stolpebank. These mines hit the following ships:
Outcome.
Differently from the past offensives, no Soviet submarine was lost due mine or enemy action while a number of merchants and few German warships were sunk. While successful, the offensive begun too late to seriously interfere with the German naval evacuation of Revel between 18 and 23 September 1944.

Cresta Run (horse)

Cresta Run (1924 – after 1930) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare. As a two-year-old in 1926 she showed steady improvement, winning two of her i races including the valuable Imperial Produce Stakes. On her three-year-old debut she recorded a very impressive win in the 1000 Guineas but failed to reproduce her form in two subsequent races over longer distances. She had little immediate success as a broodmare but had a long-term influence on the breed though her daughter Gold Race.
Background.
Cresta Run was a bay mare bred and owned by Giles Loder who owned the Eyresfield Stud in County Kildare. Throughout her racing career she was trained by Peter Gilpin at his Clarehaven Stable in Newmarket, Suffolk. She was described as a "charming filly" with "well-developed quarters" and an "intelligent head".
She was from the sixth crop of foals sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making her a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Hurry On sired numerous other major winners including Captain Cuttle, Coronach, Call Boy, Pennycomequick and Precipitation. Cresta Run's dam Bridgemount also produced Foxbridge who was exported to New Zealand where he sired Hi Jinx and Foxzami.
Racing career.
1926: two-year-old season.
Cresta Run began her racing career by finishing unplaced behind Book Law in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. She was also unplaced in the National Breeders' Produce Stakes and then ran third in the Prince of Wales's Plate before recording her first success in the Highclere Nursery Handicap at Newbury Racecourse. On 8 October Cresta Run carried 127 pounds in the £3,797 Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton Park Racecourse and won by three lengths from eleven opponents in a time of 1:13.00. At Newmarket Racecourse in later that month she was matched against male opposition in the Middle Park Stakes but finished uplaced behind the colt Call Boy.
Cresta Run ended the season with earnings of £4,880.
1927: three-year-old season.
The 114th running of 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile on 29 April attracted a field of twenty-eight runners and Cresta Run, ridden by Arthur Balding, started at odds of 10/1. She appeared somewhat nervous and agitated in the paddock before the race but started well and immediately assumed the lead. She was never seriously challenged and won the race with "ridiculous ease" by two lengths from Book Law and Endowment, who dead-heated for second place. Her winning time of 1:38.0 was 0.2 seconds faster than that recorded by Adam's Apple in the 2000 Guineas over the same course.
In the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse Cresta Run started 3/1 second favourite behind Book Law. The large, noisy crowd, high temperatures and three false starts led her to become very upset and after being left behind the other fillies at the start she finished last of the sixteen runners in a race won by Beam. Later that summer she was beaten by Cinq a Sept in the Irish Oaks.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Cresta Run an "average" winner of the 1000 Guineas.
Breeding record.
Cresta Run was retired from racing to become a broodmare. Gold Race had little success as a racehorse but had considerable influence as a broodmare, with her female-line descendants including Jupiter Island, Precocious and Grand Lodge.

Gu Ti

Gu Ti ( third century), courtesy name Zitong, was an official of the state of Eastern Wu in the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was a relative of Gu Yong, the second Imperial Chancellor of Eastern Wu.
Life.
Gu Ti was from Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu. He was from the same clan as Gu Yong. In his youth, he became famous among his fellow townsfolk after he was nominated as a "xiaolian" (civil service candidate). When he was 14 years old, he started serving as a low-level official in the local commandery office. As he grew older, he rose to the position of a Palace Gentleman (郎中) and was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍).
When Sun Quan, the founding emperor of Eastern Wu, was in his twilight years, a power struggle broke out between his sons Sun He and Sun Ba over the succession to their father's throne. The cause of the conflict was Sun Quan's failure to make a clear distinction between the statuses of the two princes. Although he already designated Sun He as the crown prince, he favoured Sun Ba and treated him exceptionally well. Gu Ti, along with the general Zhu Ju, often urged Sun Quan to follow Confucian rules of propriety and ensure that Sun He, as the legitimate heir apparent, received greater honours and privileges as compared to Sun Ba. They spoke in a very sincere and candid manner. Their colleagues in the imperial court were rather taken aback by their response.
Gu Ti was known for being very respectful towards his wife even though he spent little time with her. He often got home very late at night after work, and left home for work very early in the morning. On one occasion, when he fell sick at work, his wife came to visit him. He immediately instructed his subordinates to help him get dressed in proper attire and support him as he went out to meet his wife and ask her to go home. He earned much praise for his faithfulness towards his wife.
Gu Ti's father, Gu Xiang (顧向), consecutively served as the prefect of four counties throughout his career and still held office even in his old age. Whenever Gu Ti received a letter from his father, he washed up, dressed properly, laid out a straw mat and knelt on it as he read the letter. After reading every line, he responded as if he was attentively listening to his father speaking. After he finished reading the letter, he kowtowed as if his father was there for him to pay his respects to. When he received news that his father was ill, he shed tears and started sobbing.
After his father died of old age, Gu Ti was so upset that he did not eat and drink for five days. He refused to change out of his mourning attire until Sun Quan forced him to wear a linen robe without padding as a replacement for his mourning attire. Although Gu Ti had to restrain his grief so that he could continue with his career, he missed his father so much that he often drew images of a coffin on walls, set up altars, and started crying in front of them. He eventually died of grief before completing three years of filial mourning.
Descendants.
Gu Ti had four sons: Gu Yan (顧彥), Gu Li (顧禮), Gu Qian (顧謙) and Gu Mi (顧祕). Gu Mi served as the governor of Jiao Province during the Jin dynasty. Gu Mi's son, Gu Zhong (顧衆), served as a Supervisor of the Masters of Writing (尚書僕射) in the Jin government.

Biography.
Jehan possibly traces his family roots back to the small town of La Ferté-Bernard where several members of the Le Texier family are documented, including a homonymous stone mason who is probably Jehan de Beauce's cousin . The name Jehan Texier appears in the town ledgers of Le Mans in 1474 where he possibly worked as a stonemason at the castle.

Ocean Pier Railway at Atlantic City

The Ocean Pier Railway at Atlantic City was an electric narrow gauge railway, which ran over the entire length of the 
Ocean Pier in Atlantic City, about into the ocean.
History.
The Ocean Pier at Atlantic City was extended by in 1896/97. At the same time it was widened, and the railway, a fishing platform and several pavilions were built. The gauge of the railway was . At the shore loop the distance between the inner rails was , which necessitated a very sharp curve. The loop at the ocean end was broader and permitted a curve with diameter. The power station was located at the inner end of the pier. Mr Young and Mr McShea were the builders and operated the railway line. The pleasant ride and the fine view of the city made the railroad a favorite with the summer visitors.
Rolling stock.
To prevent excessive friction and wear on the wheels Denney's divided axles were used, which permitted the wheels to rotate independently of each other. The coupling was of gun metal, in three pieces, which were riveted together after the brasses were in place. The portion of the coupling shown at the right in the cut was shrunk into that half of the axle. The collar at the extreme end of the coned portion of the 
axle was also shrunk on. A long conical bearing with adjustable brasses was provided as shown. The joints of the coupling were tight so that it could be filled with oil. With this axle little trouble was experienced from the sharp curves.

Constitutional challenges to the New Deal

The New Deal often encountered heavy criticism, and had many constitutional challenges.
Roosevelt was wary of the Supreme Court early in his first term, and his administration was slow to bring constitutional challenges of New Deal legislation before the court. However, early wins for New Deal supporters came in "Home Building &amp; Loan Association v. Blaisdell" and "Nebbia v. New York" at the start of 1934. At issue in each case were state laws relating to economic regulation. "Blaisdell" concerned the temporary suspension of creditor's remedies by Minnesota in order to combat mortgage foreclosures, finding that temporal relief did not, in fact, impair the obligation of a contract. "Nebbia" held that New York could implement price controls on milk, in accordance with the state's police power. While not tests of New Deal legislation themselves, the cases gave cause for relief of administration concerns about Associate Justice Owen Roberts, who voted with the majority in both cases. Roberts's opinion for the court in "Nebbia" was also encouraging for the administration:
"Nebbia" also holds a particular significance: it was the one case in which the Court abandoned its jurisprudential distinction between the "public" and "private" spheres of economic activity, an essential distinction in the court's analysis of state police power. The effect of this decision radiated outward, affecting other doctrinal methods of analysis in wage regulation, labor, and the power of the U.S. Congress to regulate commerce.
Just three weeks after its defeat in the railroad pension case, the Roosevelt administration suffered its most severe setback, on May 27, 1935: "Black Monday". Chief Justice Hughes arranged for the decisions announced from the bench that day to be read in order of increasing importance. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously against Roosevelt in three cases:
With several cases laying forth the criteria necessary to respect the due process and property rights of individuals, and statements of what constituted an appropriate delegation of legislative powers to the President, Congress quickly revised the Agricultural Adjustment Act (AAA). However, New Deal supporters still wondered how the AAA would fare against Chief Justice Hughes's restrictive view of the Commerce Clause from the "Schechter" decision.
On what became known as White Monday, on March 29, 1937, the court handed down three decisions upholding New Deal legislation, two of them unanimous: "West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish", "Wright v. Vinton Branch", and "Virginia Railway v. Federation". The "Wright" case upheld a new Frazier-Lemke Act which had been redrafted to meet the Court's objections in the "Radford" case; similarly, "Virginia Railway" case upheld labor regulations for the railroad industry, and is particularly notable for its foreshadowing of how the Wagner Act cases would be decided as the National Labor Relations Board was modeled on the Railway Labor Act contested in the case.
Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan.
The first major test of New Deal legislation came in "Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan", announced January 7, 1935. Contested in this case was the National Industrial Recovery Act, Section 9(c), in which Congress had delegated to the President authority "to prohibit the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum ... produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted ... by any State law". The NIRA passed in June 1933, and Roosevelt moved quickly to file executive orders to regulate the oil industry. Two small, independent oil producers, Panama Refining Co. and Amazon Petroleum Co. filed suit seeking an injunction to halt enforcement, arguing that the law exceeded Congress's interstate commerce power and improperly delegated authority to the President.
The Supreme Court, by an 8-1 margin, agreed with the oil companies, finding that Congress had inappropriately delegated its regulatory power without both a clear statement of policy and the establishment of a specific set of standards by which the President was empowered to act. Although a loss for the Roosevelt administration and New Deal supporters, it was mitigated by the narrowness of the court's opinion, which did not deny Congress's authority to regulate interstate oil commerce. Chief Justice Hughes, who wrote the majority opinion, indicated that the policy which Section 9(c) enacted was not unconstitutional and that it was only ruled unconstitutional because it was poorly worded and did not convey specific powers. The Court's opinion indicated that Congress could resolve the unconstitutional provisions of the Act by simply adding procedural safeguards, hence the Connally Hot Oil Act of 1935 was passed into law.
Gold Clause Cases.
Economic regulation again appeared before the Supreme Court in the "Gold Clause Cases". In his first week after taking office, Roosevelt closed the nation's banks, acting from fears that gold hoarding and international speculation posed a danger to the national monetary system. He based his actions on the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. Congress quickly ratified Roosevelt's action with the Emergency Banking Act. A month later, the President issued Executive Order 6102, confiscating all gold coins, bullion, and certificates, requiring they be surrendered to the government by May 1, 1933 in exchange for currency. Congress also passed a joint resolution cancelling all gold clauses in public and private contracts, stating such clauses interfered with its power to regulate U.S. currency.
While the Roosevelt administration waited for the court to return its judgment, contingency plans were made for an unfavorable ruling. Ideas circulated within the White House to narrowly exercise the government's power of sovereign immunity by withdrawing the right to sue the government to enforce gold clauses. Attorney General Cummings suggested the court should be immediately packed to ensure a favorable ruling. Roosevelt himself ordered the Treasury to manipulate the market to give the impression of turmoil, although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau refused. Roosevelt also drew up executive orders to close all stock exchanges and prepared a radio address to the public.
On February 18, 1935, the Justices' decisions in all three cases were announced; all supported the government's position by a narrow 5–4 majority. Chief Justice Hughes wrote the opinion for each case, finding the government had plenary power to regulate money. As such, the abrogation of both private and public contractual gold clauses was within congressional reach when such clauses represented a threat to Congress's control of the monetary system. Speaking for the Court in the "Perry" case, Hughes's opinion was remarkable: in a judicial tongue-lashing not seen since "Marbury v. Madison", Hughes chided Congress for an act which, while legal, was regarded as clearly immoral. However, Hughes ultimately found the plaintiff had no cause of action, and thus no standing to sue the government.
Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co..
While not itself a part of the New Deal, the Roosevelt administration kept a close eye on the challenge to the 1934 Railroad Retirement Act, "Railroad Retirement Board v. Alton Railroad Co.". Its similarity with the Social Security Act meant the test of the railroad pension regime would serve as an indicator of whether Roosevelt's ambitious retirement program would be found constitutional. The railroad pension was designed to encourage older rail workers to retire, thereby creating jobs for younger railroaders desperately in need of work, although ostensibly Congress passed the act on the grounds that it would increase safety on the country's railways.
Numerous challenges to the law were filed in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, and injunctions were issued on the grounds that the law was an unconstitutional regulation of an activity not connected to interstate commerce. The Supreme Court took the case without waiting for an appeal to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.
On May 6, 1935, Justice Roberts's 5–4 opinion for the Court rejected the government's position, dismissing the purported effect on railway safety as "without support in reason or common sense". Further, Roberts took issue with a provision of the act which awarded pension computation credit to former rail workers, regardless of when they had last worked in the industry. Roberts characterized the provision as "a naked appropriation of private property" — taking the belongings "of one and bestowing it upon another" — and a violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
Black Monday.
Humphrey's Executor v. United States.
The first of three cases on Black Monday read out was "Humphrey's Executor v. United States". After taking office, President Roosevelt came to believe that William Humphrey, a Republican appointed to a six-year term on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 1931, was at odds with the administration's New Deal initiatives. Writing to request Humphrey's resignation from the FTC in August 1933, Roosevelt openly admitted his reason for seeking his removal: "I did not feel that your mind and my mind go along together." This proved to be a blunder on Roosevelt's part. When Humphrey could not be persuaded to resign, Roosevelt dismissed him from office on October 7.
Humphrey promptly filed suit to return to his appointed office and to collect backpay. The basis for his suit was the 1914 Federal Trade Commission Act, which specified that the President was only authorized to remove a FTC commissioner "for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office". Humphrey died on February 14, 1934 and his suit was carried on by his wife — as executor of his estate — for backpay up to the date of his death (with interest).
Associate Justice George Sutherland read the court's opinion, holding that Roosevelt had indeed acted outside of his authority when he fired Humphrey from the FTC, stating that Congress had intended regulatory commissions such as the FTC to be independent of executive influence.
Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford.
Next announced was "Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v. Radford". The 1934 Frazier-Lemke Farm Bankruptcy Act was designed to give aid to debt-ridden farmers, allowing them to reacquire farms they had lost from foreclosure, or to petition the Bankruptcy Court within their district to suspend foreclosure proceedings. The legislation's ultimate goal was to help those farmers scale down their mortgages.
The opinion of the court, read by Justice Louis Brandeis, struck down the act on Fifth Amendment Takings Clause grounds. The court found the act stripped the creditor of property which was held before the passage of the act, without any form of compensation, and bestowed the property upon the debtor. Further, the act allowed the debtor to remain on the mortgaged property for up to five years after declaring bankruptcy, giving the creditor no opportunity to foreclose immediately. While the states could not impair contract obligations, the federal government could—but it could not take property in such a manner without compensating the creditor.
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States.
The final blow for the President on Black Monday fell with the reading of "Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States", which revisited the National Industrial Recovery Act, invalidating the NIRA in its entirety.
Under Section 3 of the NIRA, the President had promulgated the Live Poultry Code to regulate the New York poultry market. The Schechter brothers had been charged with criminal violations of the code and were convicted, whereupon they appealed on grounds that the NIRA was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power to the executive, the NIRA sought to regulate business which was not engaged in interstate commerce, and that certain sections violated the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.
Chief Justice Hughes delivered the opinion of the unanimous court, holding that Congress had delegated too much lawmaking authority to the President without any clear guidelines or standards. Section 3 granted either trade associations or the President authority to draft "codes of fair competition", which amounted to a capitulation of congressional legislative authority. The arrangement presented the danger that private entities, and not government officials, could engage in creating codes of law enforceable upon the public. Justice Benjamin Cardozo, who had been the lone dissent in the similar "Panama" case, agreed with the majority. In his concurring opinion, Cardozo described Section 3 as "delegation run riot".
Hughes also renewed an old method of jurisprudence concerning the "current of commerce" theory of the Commerce Clause as expounded by Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. in "Swift v. United States". Hughes determined the poultry at issue in the case, though purchased for slaughter interstate, were not intended for any further interstate transactions after Schecter slaughtered them. Thus, the poultry were outside of Congress's authoritative reach unless Schechter's business had a direct and logical connection to interstate commerce, per the Shreveport Rate Case. Hughes used a direct/indirect effect analysis to determine the Schechters' business was not within the reach of congressional regulation.
Roosevelt reacts.
Upon learning of the unanimity of the three court decisions, Roosevelt became distressed and irritable, regarding the opinions as personal attacks. The Supreme Court's decision in "Humphrey's Ex." particularly stunned the administration. Only nine years earlier, in "Myers v. United States", the Taft Court had held the President's power to remove executive officials was plenary. Roosevelt and his entourage viewed Sutherland's particularly vicious criticism as an attempt to publicly shame the President and paint him as having purposefully violated the Constitution.
After the decisions came down, Roosevelt remarked at a May 31 press conference that the "Schechter" decision had "relegated [the nation] to a horse and buggy definition of interstate commerce". The comment lit a fire under the media and indignated the public. Scorned for the perceived attack on the court, Roosevelt assumed a diplomatic silence toward the court and waited for a better opportunity to press his cause with the public.
United States v. Butler.
The Agricultural Adjustment Act received its trial in the case of "United States v. Butler", announced January 6, 1936. The AAA had created an agricultural regulatory program with a supporting processing tax; the revenue raised was then specifically used to pay farmers to reduce their acreage and production, which would in turn reduce surplus harvest yields and increase prices. Officials of the Hoosac Mills Corp. argued that the AAA was as unconstitutional as the National Industrial Recovery Act, attempting to regulate activity not in interstate commerce. Specifically attacked was the use of Congress's Taxing and Spending power undergirding the program. On January 6, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the AAA unconstitutional by a 6-3 margin.
Associate Justice Roberts again delivered the opinion of a divided court, agreeing with those challenging the tax. Regarding agriculture as an essentially local activity, the court invalidated the AAA as a violation of the powers reserved to the states under the Tenth Amendment. The court also used the occasion to settle a dispute over the General Welfare Clause stemming back to the administration of George Washington, holding Congress possessed a power to tax and spend for the general welfare.
Carter v. Carter Coal Co..
Following the undoing of the National Recovery Administration by the "Schechter" decision, Congress attempted to salvage the coal industry code promulgated under the National Industrial Recovery Act in the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935. The act, closely following the criteria of the "Schechter" ruling, declared a public interest in coal production and found it so integrated into interstate commerce as to warrant federal regulation. The code subjected the coal industry to labor, price, and practice regulations, levying a 15 percent tax on all producers with a provision to refund a significant portion of the tax for those adhering to the legislation's dictates. James Carter, shareholder and president of the Carter Coal Co., filed suit against the board of directors when they voted to pay the tax.
On May 18, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the act unconstitutional by a 5-4 margin. Associate Justice Sutherland read the "Carter v. Carter Coal Company" opinion, striking down the coal act in its entirety, citing the "Schechter" decision. Most surprising in the opinion was reliance on 19th-century cases legal scholars had thought long repudiated: "Kidd v. Pearson" and "United States v. E. C. Knight Co."
Ashton v. Cameron County Water Improvement Dist. No. 1.
On May 25, 1936, the Supreme Court ruled the 1934 Municipal Bankruptcy Act (also known as the Sumners-Wilcox Bill) was unconstitutional in a 5-4 decision. The law amended the Federal Bankruptcy Act and permitted any municipality or other political subdivision of any state to obtain a voluntary readjustment of its debts through proceedings in Federal Court. Texas' Cameron County Water Improvement Dist. No. 1, which claimed to be insolvent and unable to meets its debts in the long run, petitioned the local Federal District Court for readjustments granted under the Municipal Bankruptcy Act. The case eventually reached the Supreme Court, which found that the law violated Tenth Amendment rights of state sovereignty.
Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo.
The final provocation for New Deal supporters came in the overturning of a New York minimum wage statute on June 1, 1936. "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo" was an important attempt among New Deal supporters to overturn a prior Supreme Court decision prohibiting wage price controls, "Adkins v. Children's Hospital". Felix Frankfurter, who had led the earlier unsuccessful arguments before the Supreme Court, worked carefully to craft the law for the New York legislature so it would stand up to challenges based upon the "Adkins" opinion.
The case resulted from the indictment of a Brooklyn laundry owner John Tipaldo, who not only had failed to pay his female employees the required minimum salary ($12.40 per week), but had further hidden his transgression by falsifying his books. Tipaldo contested the law under which he was charged as unconstitutional and filed for "habeas corpus" relief. The New York Court of Appeals found itself in agreement with Tipaldo, being unable to find any substantial difference between the New York law and the Washington, D.C. law overturned in "Adkins".
How the court split its vote in this case is supportive of challenges to the "switch in time" narrative. Justices Brandeis, Stone, and Cardozo each thought "Adkins" was incorrectly decided and wanted to overturn it. Chief Justice Hughes believed the New York law differed from the law in "Adkins" and wanted to uphold the New York statute. Justices Van Devanter, McReynolds, Sutherland, and Butler found no distinctions and voted to uphold the "habeas corpus" petition. The outcome of the "Tipaldo" case thus hung in the balance of Justice Roberts's vote. Roberts could find no distinction in the two minimum wage laws, but appears to have been inclined to support an overturning of "Adkins" anyway. However, Roberts believed the appellant had not taken issue with the "Adkins" precedent and failed to challenge it. Having no "case or controversy" legs upon which to stand, Roberts deferred to the "Adkins" precedent.
Roosevelt broke his year-long silence on Supreme Court issues to comment on the "Tipaldo" opinion:
"West Coast Hotel v. Parrish".
The decision in the "Parrish" case received the most attention, and later became an integral part of the "switch in time" narrative of conventional history. In the case, the court divided along the same lines it had in the "Tipaldo" case, only this time around Roberts voted to overrule the "Adkins" precedent as the case brief specifically asked the court to reconsider its prior decision. Further, the decision worked to hinder Roosevelt's push for the court reform bill, further reducing what little public support there was for change in the Supreme Court.
Roberts had voted to grant "certiorari" to hear the "Parrish" case before the election of 1936. Oral arguments occurred on December 16 and 17, 1936, with counsel for Parrish specifically asking the court to reconsider its decision in "Adkins v. Children's Hospital", which had been the basis for striking down a New York minimum wage law in "Morehead v. New York ex rel. Tipaldo" in the late spring of 1936.
Roberts, however, indicated his desire to overturn "Adkins" immediately after oral arguments on December 17, 1936. The initial conference vote on December 19, 1936 was split 4–4; with this even division on the Court, the holding of the Washington Supreme Court, finding the minimum wage statute constitutional, would stand. The eight voting justices anticipated Justice Stone—absent due to illness—would be the fifth vote necessary for a majority opinion affirming the constitutionality of the minimum wage law. As Chief Justice Hughes desired a clear and strong 5–4 affirmation of the Washington Supreme Court's judgment, rather than a 4–4 default affirmation, he convinced the other justices to wait until Stone's return before both deciding and announcing the case.
President Roosevelt announced his court reform bill on February 5, 1937, the day of the first conference vote after Stone's February 1, 1937, return to the bench. Roosevelt later made his justifications for the bill to the public on March 9, 1937, during his 9th Fireside Chat. The Court's opinion in "Parrish" was not published until March 29, 1937, after Roosevelt's radio address. Chief Justice Hughes wrote in his autobiographical notes that Roosevelt's court reform proposal "had not the slightest effect on our [the court's] decision", but due to the delayed announcement of its decision, the Court was characterized as retreating under fire. Roosevelt also believed that because of the overwhelming support that had been shown for the New Deal in his re-election, Hughes was able to persuade Roberts to no longer base his votes on his own political beliefs and side with him during future votes on New Deal-related policies. In one of his notes from 1936, Hughes wrote that Roosevelt's re-election forced the court to depart from "its fortress in public opinion" and severely weakened its capability to base its rulings on personal or political beliefs.
Shortly after leaving the Court, Roberts reportedly burned all of his legal and judicial papers. As a result, there is no significant collection of Roberts' manuscript papers, as there is for most other modern Justices. Roberts did prepare a short memorandum discussing his alleged change of stance around the time of the court-packing effort, which he left in the hands of Justice Felix Frankfurter.

Gimhae Heo clan

Gimhae Heo clan () is one of the Korean clans. This clan traces their origin to King Suro and his Queen Heo Hwang-ok, who are mentioned in the 13th-century Korean chronicle "Samguk Yusa". King Suro was the founder of Gaya confederacy, and his descendant Gim Yu-sin is renowned for unifying the Silla polity. According to a 2015 survey, the population of Gimhae Heo clan is 1,340,688.
The founder of Gimhae Heo clan, a 35th descendant of Queen Heo Hwang-ok and King Suro, was who served in the court of King Munjong of Goryeo. He was appointed as the Prince of Garak / Gaya ().
More than six million present day Koreans, especially from Gimhae Kim, Gimhae Heo clan and Lee (Yi) clans, trace their lineage to the legendary queen as the direct descendants of Queen Heo Hwang-ok's children with King Kim Suro. These 3 clans associate their Bon-gwan (geo-biological lineage roots) to Gimhae in South Gyeongsang Province of Korea, and these clans place restrictions on marriage with each other due to the shared ancestors. Today, the Gimhae Gim clan is the largest clan group among them.
The Gimhae Heo clan and Gimhae Gim clan, descended from the two sons of King Suro who used their mother's Queen Heo Hwang-ok's surname, instead of their father's. According to "Samguk Yusa" Queen Heo Hwang-ok became the wife of King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya at the age of 16, after having arrived in Gaya confederacy in Korea in the year 48 AD by boat from a distant kingdom called "Ayuta", making her the first queen of Geumgwan Gaya. Her native kingdom is believed to be located in India by some, there is however no mention of her in any pre-modern Indian sources. There is a tomb in Gimhae in Korea, that are believed by some to be of King Suro and Queen Heo, and a memorial of Queen Heo Hwang-ok in Hindu holy city of Ayodhya in India.
Origin.
The Gimhae Heo clan founder was King Suro, whose wife was Queen Heo Hwang-ok. She set sail from India, later arriving at Gimhae. Some sources have identified Ayodhya in Northern India as the native place of Queen Heo Hwang-ok. This is considered dubious as the ancient name of Ayodhya was “Saketa” in the 13th century when the Samguk Yusa was written.
Queen Heo Hwang-ok's association with Ayodhya is based on the book "Heo Hwang-ok Route: From India to Gaya of Korea" by a senior Archeologist and Emeritus Professor at Hanyang University, Kim Byung-mo, which is considered speculative by some. The Memorial of Heo Hwang-ok in Ayodhya, is visited by a large number of Koreans, especially around jesa in April, to pay tribute to Queen Heo as she is considered an ancestor to over six million Koreans. She was supposedly of Indian-origin from Ayodhya and had traveled to Korea to marry King Suro of Geumgwan Gaya in 48 CE.
Another theory is that the Ayuta Kingdom (Hangul: 아유타국, Hanja: 阿踰陁國) is interpreted as the Ay Kingdom that was a vassal to Pandyan Empire of ancient Tamilakam. The Ay Kingdom was mentioned in ancient Tamil anthology Ciṟupāṇāṟṟuppaṭai. The Samguk Yusa states that Princess Heo Hwang-ok carried with her the symbols of Pandya: the ‘’twin fish’’ and ‘’Trident’’. Her native kingdom is believed to be located at Lanyakumari, an ancient south Indian city. According to the Samguk Yusa, Queen Heo’s name was Hwang-ok(Hangul: 황옥, Hanja: 黃玉), the name means yellow Coral in the Tamil language (Tamil: Sem Pavalam, சீம்பவளம்). The coral ornament industry was famous in ancient Tamil Nadu at that time, and indicates a possible Tamil connection. However, the Samguk sagi, another source regarding the Geumgwan Gaya, makes no reference to Queen Heo's origin. As stated by the Korean envoy Kygsoo Kim, experts have yet to rule out the possibility of Queen Heo being of Tamil origin.

Days of Future Passed Live

Days of Future Passed Live is a live album by The Moody Blues that consists of their live performance at the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts in Toronto in 2017. The album was released on 23 March 2018.
The performance was the first time in the band's history that they had played the entire "Days of Future Passed" album live, and is particularly notable for the inclusion of songs written by Mike Pinder, whose material has seldom been included in the band's live sets since his 1978 departure. Justin Hayward and John Lodge, respectively, sing lead on two songs that were originally sung by Pinder ("Dawn is a Feeling" and "The Sunset"). Noted British actor Jeremy Irons takes over Pinder's narration for the bookend poems "Morning Glory" and "Late Lament". On songs written by Ray Thomas (who retired from the band in 2002), Hayward and Lodge share lead vocals on "Another Morning", and Hayward sings "Twilight Time". The performance alters the album's sequence slightly, placing "Late Lament" before "Nights in White Satin".

Harpsichord Concerto in E major, BWV 1053

The Harpsichord Concerto in E major, BWV 1053, is a concerto for harpsichord and string orchestra by Johann Sebastian Bach. It is the second of Bach's keyboard concerto composed in 1738, scored for keyboard and baroque string orchestra. The movements were reworkings of parts of two of Bach's church cantatas composed in 1726: the solo obbligato organ played the sinfonias for the two fast movements; and the remaining alto aria provided the slow movement.
Historical context.
Like the other harpsichord concertos, BWV 1053 is generally agreed to be a transcription of a lost instrumental concerto. As with the harpsichord concerto BWV 1052, all the movements had previous incarnations in Leipzig cantatas written ten or more years prior to the 1738 or 1739 autograph manuscript, with the part of the melody instrument written for obbligato organ. The first and second movements of BWV 1053 corresponds to the opening "Sinfonia" (in D major) and alto aria "Stirb in mir, Welt" (in B minor) in "Gott soll allein mein Herze haben, BWV 169"; and the finale to the opening "Sinfonia" (in E major) in "Ich geh und suche mit Verlangen, BWV 49". The cantatas, part of a series where Bach developed the obbligato organ as a chamber or orchestral instrument, were first performed in October and November 1726 in the Thomaskirche, within two weeks of each other. The scoring in BWV 169 includes two oboes and a taille as ripieno instruments in the sinfonia and an oboe d'amore in the aria. In the aria, the lines of the alto soloist and organ weave around each in what Alfred Dürr has described as "undoubtedly one of the most inspired vocal pieces that Bach ever wrote ... a passionate submersion in heavenly love."
As comments, this shows the subtleties in Bach's process of arrangement. In this case the superposition of the additional vocal line over the keyboard part "aims at the exploration, enrichment and perfection of the original compositional material." An oboe d'amore was also added as a ripieno instrument in the sinfonia of BWV 49.
Since Ulrich Siegele's 1957 dissertation, where he suggested that BWV 1053 originated in either a flute concerto in F major or oboe concerto in E major, a number of reconstructions for different melody instruments have been proposed, all discussed in : Hermann Töttcher &amp; Gottfried Müller (in F major for oboe, 1955); by Wilfried Fischer (in E major for oboe, 1966, and viola, 1996); by Joshua Rifkin (in E major for oboe, 1983); by Arnold Mehl (in D major for oboe d'amore. 1983): and by Bruce Haynes (in D major for oboe d'amore, 1998). Further discussions concerning the possible original form of the concerto can be found in , , and . In , problems with all the reconstructions are mentioned: for woodwind instruments, breathing problems created by long uninterrupted passages of semiquaver triplets in the third movement; and for the viola, the complete absence of string-like figurations in the whole concerto. Given the occurrence of all three movements in 1726 cantatas, he has suggested that the concerto might originally have been composed for an unspecified keyboard instrument—interchangeably a harpsichord or an organ depending on the venue—and that it might have been one of the pieces played during Bach's recital on the Silbermann organ in the Sophienkirche, Dresden in September 1725.
The harpsichord part in the first movement of BWV 1053 differs from the 1726 organ part in several ways in the solo passages: in the right hand the melody line became far more elaborate and ornamental; and in the left hand the figured bass line was replaced by a denser texture of fully worked out figures and chords—the left hand was "emancipated" in the words of . At the same time in the orchestral parts, Bach reduced the contributions of the lower strings and adjusted the contributions from upper strings to create a proper balance with the harpsichord, with none of the string parts doubled except for the bass instruments. The lighter scoring permitted counterpoint between the first violin and the harpsichord in solo episodes. This method of adaptation—in the style of Bach's full maturity—was a departure from that used for BWV 1052 and was employed in the subsequent concertos BWV 1054–1057.
Musical structure.
First movement: [Allegro].
The musical structure of the first movement of BWV 1053—concisely written but complex in its many intricate and ingenious details—has been analysed in and . The movement combines the strict da capo "A"–"B"–"A" form of an aria with the ritornello structure of a concerto. Section "A" comprises 62 bars. In the opening eight-bar ritornello, the harpsichord initially plays as part of the ripieno, taking the first violin part in the right hand and the continuo in the left. After this tutti opening the harpsichord follows its own course, responding with a nine-bar episode that introduces its own material.
There are three further ritornello passages with two intermittent responses in solo episodes for the harpsichord. Bach devised the harpsichord's rhythmic thematic material as a contrasting counter-theme to the semiquaver motifs at the head of the ritornello. In each reprise the scoring of the ritornello is varied: the harpsichord alternates between its own counter-theme and that of the opening ritornello; it plays increasingly brilliant variants of its own material—eventually including joyful dactyl motifs—in counterpoint to the semiquaver violin theme. The middle section "B" is 51 bars long and is mostly in the minor mode, beginning in F minor. There are three solo episodes for harpsichord punctuated by two reprises of the orchestral ritornello, first in F (bar 69) and then in its relative major key, A major (bar 81). Less tied to the ritornello, the harpsichord freely develops its own material, which is derived from that of section "A". The third and longest episode of 27 bars begins in bar 86 and remains centred on the tonality of C minor. The strings provide a simple accompaniment to the long phrases of the extended harpsichord solo; between phrases the first violin plays a brief reprise in C minor of the opening semiquaver motif of the ritornello. The episode culminates in a semiquaver passage over an extended G pedal point and an Adagio cadence and fermata in C minor. The movement then resumes with a recapitulation of the whole of section "A".
Second movement: Siciliano.
The slow movement in C♯ minor and time is a Siciliano, which has described as beautiful and haunting. In da capo form, the sustained string ritornello is accompanied by the harpsichord with an explicit realisation of the figured bass by gentle broken chord semiquavers. After the opening ritornello, the harpsichord, accompanied by detached quaver chords in the strings, plays its own melodic line spun out in two long increasingly ornamented phrases, the second of which merges into the semiquaver accompaniment of the closing ritornello.
Third movement: Allegro.
The third movement of BWV 1053 is a sprightly and dance-like allegro in E major and time. Like the first movement, its concise and ingenious compositional form combines the da capo structure of an aria with the ritornello structure of a concerto; it also has similarly light scoring in the orchestral parts to create a proper balance between harpsichord and strings. Although the overall structure is similar to that of the first movement, the alternations between concertato soloist and ripieno are more frequent and complex. Rather than the concertos of Vivaldi, Gregory Butler has suggested that this movement is closer in form and style to the concertos of another of Bach's Italian contemporaries, the Venetian composer Tomaso Albinoni. Butler has made a detailed study of Albinoni's two sets of twelve "concerti a cinque", Op.7 (1715) and Op.9 (1722), each set having four violin concertos, four oboe concertos and four double oboe concertos, and has proposed the last movement of the double oboe concerto op.9, No.3 as a possible precursor of BWV 1053/3.
Bach's third movement is written in strict da capo "A"–"B"–"A" form, with 137 bars in the "A" section and 122 in the "B" section. The opening eighteen-bar ritornello has an introductory section or "Vordersatz" of four bars: the strings play the "head" motif—three quavers, four semiquavers and a quaver—in canon commencing in the first violin, then the second and then the viola. This rhythm is repeated in the first eight bars of the ritornello. Below the strings and the only instrument starting the movement, the harpsichord plays an introductory flourish of arpeggiated semiquaver triplets filling in the harmonies and spanning almost the entire keyboard. In the remainder of the ritornello the harpsichord doubles the first violin part in the right hand and the continuo in the left.
The harpsichord then begins its own thematic material in the first solo episode. At first it plays only the first four bars as a brief declamation, which elicits the ritornello's "Vordersatz" as a response. This is followed by a reprise by the harpsichord of the new thematic material, now extended to a sixteen bar episode.
This episode is followed by a reprise of the entire 18-bar ritornello in the dominant key of B major. In this reprise the lower string parts are pruned; now the right hand of the harpsichord part provides the counterpoint to the first violin part that instead of the second violin and viola; and the left hand plays its own semiquaver figuration in tandem with the continuo line. There are two further episodes for the harpsichord in which its own material is developed with passagework in semiquavers, in semiquaver triplets and in parallel and contrary motion semiquavers in both hands. These are separated by a shortened version of the ritornello and followed by a full version, with its last two bars pruned down to harpsichord and first violin. Section "A" concludes, following the traditional pattern established by Albinoni, with a repetition of the main body ("Vorspinnung") and concluding part ("Epilog") of the ritornello, with the harpsichord once more doubling the first violin and continuo parts.
In section "B", which immediately follows, Bach breaks with tradition: now in the relative minor, G minor, he introduces in the first solo harpsichord episode a highly contrasting chromatic theme accompanied by characteristic semiquaver figures in the left hand.
Of 38 bars in length and punctuated by fragmentary responses from the strings, the solo episode modulates through the keys of B major and C minor to a cadence in F♯ minor. It is followed by a sequence of short passages alternating between ritornello material and solo material for the harpsichord drawn from both section "B" (semiquaver figures) and then section "A" (the beginning of the harpsichord theme). The ritornello segments move from F minor to E major, the final segment modulating from F minor to B major and then E major. The next twelve bar solo episode continues with and develops the harpsichord's thematic material from section "A", modulating from E major, to B major and then to the distant key of D major. The 4-bar "Vordersatz" from the ritornello is then played in this key, then in G major, reaching the key of C minor. Section "B" ends symmetrically with an extended 33-bar solo episode, a variant of the long chromatic episode with which it began, After modulating through the keys of G minor, C minor and D minor, the movement briefly halts in the manner of a Scarlatti da capo aria with a cadence to the mediant key of G minor. The music resumes with a capitulation of section "A".

Several additional routes are operated by Network Norwich without branding applied, usually as they are infrequent services. Service 30 operates between Norwich city centre, Taverham and Thorpe Marriott, serving the Dixons Centre, Hellesdon Hospital, Sweet Briar Retail Park and Taverham High School.
Fleet.
As of June 2017, the Network Norwich fleet consists of 118 buses. This can be broken down into 32 Plaxton President-bodied Dennis Tridents; 21 Wright Eclipse Gemini 2-bodied Volvo B9TLs; 11 Wright StreetLite Maxs; 10 Wright Eclipse Metro-bodied Volvo B7Ls; nine Wright StreetDecks; eight Plaxton President-bodied Volvo B7TLs; eight Wright StreetLite DFs; five Wright Eclipse Urban-bodied Volvo B7RLEs; one Alexander ALX400 bodied Volvo B7TL; two Wright Renown-bodied Volvo B10BLE driver training buses; and two Plaxton Paragon-bodied Volvo B12M driver training coaches.
The Network Norwich fleet is maintained at a single depot, located on Roundtree Way on the Heartsease Estate. A second, smaller facility, located on Vulcan Road, provides additional capacity.
Heritage buses.
As of March 2018, Network Norwich had two vehicles painted in retro liveries based on those of the former Eastern Counties bus company, from which Network Norwich (and, by extension, First Norfolk &amp; Suffolk) can trace their history. Both vehicles were Volvo B7L single-deckers with Wright Eclipse Metro bodywork, built in 2002 and originally delivered new to First York and most recently in service with First South Yorkshire before being transferred to Norwich to be repainted into their retro liveries, these have since been scrapped. Recently, a third vehicle has been repainted in a heritage livery. A Volvo B7RLE with Wright Eclipse Urban bodywork, numbered 66985, received the same livery as 60916. In September 2020, another vehicle was transferred to Norwich in a heritage livery from its time in Sheffield; it wears the colours for the Mainline operator.

Grange Road, Adelaide

Grange Road is an arterial road in the western suburbs of Adelaide, South Australia. It runs from South Road close to the city centre to the coast at Grange. 
The eastern end of Grange Road continues over the North-South Motorway trench as Manton Street which passes Hindmarsh Stadium, behind the Adelaide Entertainment Centre, then joins the City Ring Route at Port Road and Park Terrace via a short stretch of Adam Street.
History.
Between 1894 and 1957, the Henley Beach railway line followed the west side of Military Road and crossed what is now Grange Road. The Kirkcaldy railway station was immediately south of Grange Road.
The 1936 Gregory's street directory shows that west of Tapleys Hill Road, Grange Road continued as Kircaldy Beach Road, and the area where it ended was known at that time as Kircaldy. The 1940 Fuller's directory shows Grange Road to the bridge over the Port River and Kirkcaldy Road from there to the Esplanade. Today, the bridge is just a culvert or stormwater drain, and there is only an open channel for the river downstream (north) of Grange Road.
Route description.
Grange Road starts at South Road (route A2). It crosses route A14, two offset intersections with East Avenue (north) and Holbrooks Road (south) about 50m apart between the suburbs of . It crosses route A15, Tapleys Hill Road between Seaton and Fulham Gardens. At the coastal end, it crosses Military Road and terminates at a roundabout on Seaview Road on the boundary between Grange and Henley Beach with a public car park continuing to The Esplanade on the foreshore.

Dietrichs Flucht

Dietrichs Flucht (Dietrich's Flight) or Das Buch von Bern (The Book of Verona) is an anonymous 13th-century Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the legendary counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Germanic heroic legend. It is part of the so-called "historical" Dietrich material and is closely related to, and always transmitted together with, a second Dietrich poem, the "Rabenschlacht". A Heinrich der Vogler is named as author in an excursus of the poem. Earlier scholarship considered him to be the author of "Dietrichs Flucht" and possibly also of the "Rabenschlacht", however more recent scholarship believes he is only author of this excursus.
"Dietrichs Flucht" describes the rule of Dietrich's ancestors in his kingdom in northern Italy; his betrayal and exile by his wicked uncle Ermenrich, and his flight to the Huns, where he is warmly received by Etzel and his wife Helche. With Etzel's help, Dietrich makes two attempts to reclaim his kingdom from Ermenrich, but each time his victory is pyrrhic and he is forced to return to exile with the Huns.
Unlike most German heroic poems, the poem is written in rhyming couplets, suggesting that it may have been intended to be read as a historical document like a rhymed chronicle. Alternatively, the choice of couplets may suggest a nearness to the genre of chivalric romance. The poem unites figures from various German heroic traditions, including the "Nibelungenlied", "Wolfdietrich", and "Ortnit".
Summary.
Dietrichs Flucht begins with a long history of Dietrich's ancestors, who all live exceptionally long, Methuselan and virtuous lives and leave a single heir to the kingdom. They are native to Italy (called Lomparten or Rœmischlant) and spend their lives acquiring brides and fighting dragons. This easy line of inheritance is broken first by Ortnit, who is killed by a dragon, but the succession is restored by Wolfdietrich, who marries Ortnit's widow and becomes king. Wolfdietrich has 56 children, but all die except for Hugdietrich. Hugdietrich's son Amelung, has three sons: Ermenrich, Dietmar, and Diether. When Hugdietrich dies, he divides the country among his children, Dietmar receiving Bern (Verona). Emenrich is the father of Friderich, Dietmar of Dietrich and Diether (II), and Diether of the two Harlungen.
Dietmar places his children into Ermenrich's care when he dies, however, Ermenrich proves treacherous. First he murderers the two Harlungen and takes over their country, failing to capture their regent Eckehart, then invites Dietrich to visit him in order to murder him as well. Ermenrich's messenger warns Dietrich, however, and so Ermenrich is forced to invade with an army. Dietrich defeats Ermenrich decisively in battle at Milan, capturing Ermenrich's son Friderich. He is left without any money to reward his soldiers, so he sends a group of vassals to fetch some. This group falls into an ambush by Witege, a former vassal of Dietrich's who switched sides. This results in the capture of Dietrich's best warriors, among them Hildebrand and Wolfhart. Ermenrich refuses Dietrich's offer to exchange Friderich for the prisoners and says he will only release Dietrich's men if the latter leaves the country, which, against the advice of his remaining warriors, Dietrich chooses to do. All the inhabitants of Bern leave the city, including women and children.
Dietrich goes into exile with 50 warriors, making his way to the court of Etzel, King of the Huns, at Gran. There with the help of Rüdiger and Etzel's wife Helche, Dietrich receives Etzel's support to return to Italy. Dietrich's vassal Amelolt comes to Etzel's court at this time and announces he was able to recapture Bern. Dietrich sets out immediately with the Hunnish army and his remaining warriors, followed by a large army commanded by Rüdiger. They defeat Ermenrich once again in battle at Milan, and Ermenrich fleas to Ravenna, where Dietrich besieges him. Ermenrich is able to slip out of the city to Bologna, however. Ermenrich ransoms his captured men, except for Witige, whom Dietrich refuses to release due to his treachery. On the advice of his vassals and Rüdiger, however, Dietrich forgives Witige, makes him governor of Ravenna, and gives him the horse Schemming as a gift. Dietrich then heads back to Etzel's residence at Etzelburg. Etzel and Helche suggest that Dietrich marry Helche's niece and lady-in-waiting Herrat, which Dietrich initially refuses. Hildebrand and Rüdiger eventually convince him to accept the offer.
Now Eckehart arrives and tells Dietrich that Witege has betrayed him, handing Ravenna over to Ermenrich who has killed all the inhabitants. Dietrich despairs, but Etzel is enraged and puts together a large army, which marches and defeats Ermenrich outside Bologna. Ermenrich flees into the city, but Dietrich's victory is Pyrrhic, as he has lost many good warriors. Dietrich is particularly saddened by the death of Wolfhart's brother Alphart. He is forced to return to Etzel.
Dating, creation, and transmission.
Dietrichs Flucht is transmitted together with tee "Rabenschlacht" in four complete manuscripts and alone in one fragmentary manuscript:
Excerpts from Dietrichs Flucht are also transmitted in some manuscripts of the World Chronicle of Heinrich von München.
The origins of the earliest manuscripts as well as the dialect of the poem indicate that it was composed in Austria, sometime before 1300. Given several allusions to the ways that the dukes of Austria are reducing the rights of their vassals, the poem is typically dated to after the beginning of the rule of the Habsburgs in Austria in 1282. Alternatively, this may simply provide a date for when the poem was reworked by the author of these portions, Heinrich der Vogler (see below).
Genre and interpretation.
Dietrichs Flucht is about 10000 lines long. The poem is unusual in that it is written in rhyming couplets rather than in stanzas, as is the case with most German heroic epics. It may indicate that the author was trying to make his work more similar to either courtly romance, or, more probably to a rhyming chronicle. With a single exception near the beginning, the narrator is absolutely insistent about the veracity of his story, repeating over and over again that what he is telling is true. His claims of both written and oral sources might serve to convince his audience that he is narrating historical truth while still providing the poem with the authority of the oral tradition. The poem also features a realistic geography of Northern Italy, with Norbert Voorwinden noting that the poem contains more Italian place names than any other medieval German source. He concludes that all of this indicates the work intends to imitate a chronicle. These claims appear to have been taken seriously, as the World Chronicle of Heinrich von München describes the life of the historical Theoderic according to "Dietrichs Flucht".
At the same time, the poem seeks to create something like a complete tale of the heroic world, including figures from "Wolfdietrich", "Ortnit", and the "Nibelungenlied" in Dietrich's genealogy. Moreover, Siegfried, Gunther, and Gernot all appear as figures in the poem. The opening lines of the poem also take their inspiration from the "Nibelungenlied", but the opening of "Dietrichs Flucht" instead proclaims that it will tell "newe maeren" (new tales) rather than the "alte maeren" of the "Nibelungenlied". Dietrich's repeated failed attempts to reclaim his homeland and his proclamations that he is "armer Dieterich" (poor Dietrich) may also derive from Dietrich's monologue in the "Nibelungenlied" upon losing his men. At the same time, the poem excludes any references to any tales found in the fantastical Dietrich poems. Heinzle suggests that these poems may not have seemed historical to the author. Several of Dietrich's ancestors nevertheless fight against dragons—the only time this occurs in the historical Dietrich poems.
Stylistically, the poem is notable for its portrayal of escalating violence: each battle that Dietrich fights is bloodier and deadlier than the last. The battle scenes are described in drastic terms, as the heroes literally wade in blood. Despite its drastic portrayal of warfare, the poem does not seem to criticize violence or warfare; while leaving little room for the heroic warrior ethos in the traditional sense, it nonetheless portrays battle as a tool that a ruler must use. Thematically, the poem largely deals with the topic of loyalty, especially between vassal and lord, with Dietrich and Etzel representing fealty, while Ermenrich, his deceitful advisor Sibeche, and the treacherous Witige represent disloyalty. Ermenrich appears to bring a sort of fall from grace and is described as the first figure to bring evil into the world. Dietrich is nevertheless unable to defeat him, showing that evil cannot be removed from the world. The long list of Dietrich's ancestors serves to legitimate his rule in Italy.
Lienert notes that, although the poem clearly supports Dietrich over Ermenrich, it nevertheless questions some of his decisions. For instance, Dietrich decides to go into exile to save the men Ermenrich had captured against the advice of his vassals. His pardon of Witege, while advised by his vassals, far exceeds their advice by appointing Witege governor of Ravenna in his absence.
Authorship and relationship to the "Rabenschlacht".
A certain Heinrich der Vogler names himself as author in an excursus against princely caprice in the middle of "Dietrichs Flucht". He is not attested elsewhere and may have been a wandering poet or minstrel. His authorship is now generally discounted, as it he is not named at the beginning or end of the text. Victor Millet notes, furthermore, that the excursus has some stylistic characteristics otherwise absent in the romance. Heinzle suggests that it is still possible that Heinrich is the author of "Dietrichs Flucht", but finds it more likely that he merely wrote the excursus where he is named. Werner Hoffmann believes that Heinrich reworked and expanded a pre-existing poem and connected it with the "Rabenschlacht". Hoffmann is highly critical of what he believes is Heinrich's work, pointing to numerous inconsistencies within "Dietrichs Flucht" (e.g. the hero Alphart dies twice) and between "Dietrichs Flucht" and "Rabenschlacht". Sebastian Coxon argues that Heinrich's naming himself is a strategy to grant authorial authority to the excursus, in the same way as the poem's frequent recourse to oral and fictionalized written sources for its narrative. The excursus appears to describe the situation in Austria at the time of the poem's composition.
Early scholarship believed that both "Dietrichs Fluch" and the "Rabenschlacht" had a single author; however, the formal and stylistic differences between the two epics have caused this theory to be abandoned. The manuscript transmission nevertheless makes clear that the "Rabenschlacht" and "Dietrichs Flucht" were viewed as a single work by contemporaries. Most scholarship holds the "Rabenschlacht" to be the older of the two poems, providing a model for the third battle and end of "Dietrichs Flucht", though Millet questions this interpretation. It is clear, at any rate, that both works were deliberate brought together and adapted to be transmitted together, possibly by Heinrich der Vogler.
Relation to the oral tradition.
Unlike for the supposedly older Rabenschlacht, the connection between Dietrichs Flucht and the oral tradition is disputed. Some debate exists over whether the oral tradition merely contained Dietrich's exile prior to the events of the "Rabenschlacht", or whether or not tales of at least one failed attempt to return prior to the events of that poem existed. "Dietrichs Flucht" is sometimes seen as a stringing together of the same episode (Dietrich's failed return from exile) by the poet in order to expand his material. The scholar Norbert Voorwinden has suggested that the entire poem is the invention of an author inspired by the Italian campaigns of Emperor Frederick II.

Rabenschlacht

Die Rabenschlacht (The Battle of Ravenna) is an anonymous 13th-century Middle High German poem about the hero Dietrich von Bern, the counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Germanic heroic legend. It is part of the so-called "historical" Dietrich material and is closely related to, and always transmitted together with, a second Dietrich poem, "Dietrichs Flucht". At one time, both poems were thought to have the same author, possibly a certain Heinrich der Vogler, but stylistic differences have led more recent scholarship to abandon this idea.
"Die Rabenschlacht" concerns a failed attempt by the exiled Dietrich to reclaim his kingdom in Northern Italy from his treacherous uncle Ermenrich, with the help of an army provided by Etzel, king of the Huns. In the course of this attempt, Dietrich's younger brother and Etzel's young sons by his wife Helche are killed by Dietrich's former vassal Witege outside of Ravenna. Witege then flees into the sea and is rescued by a mermaid rather than fighting against Dietrich. The poem may be a dim reflection of the death of Attila's son Ellac at the Battle of Nedao in 454, combined with Theodoric the Great's siege of Ravenna in 491–493. It would therefore be one of the oldest parts of the legends about Dietrich von Bern.
Summary.
"Die Rabenschlacht" begins a year after the end of "Dietrichs Flucht", with Dietrich still in exile at the court of Etzel. Dietrich is still saddened by the loss of his men in the previous poem, especially Alphart. Etzel announces that he will give Dietrich a new army, and there is a large feast to celebrate Dietrich's marriage to Herrad, niece of his wife Helche. Helche, however, is troubled by a dream in which a wild dragon carries away her two sons and rips them to shreds. so Helche cheers him up with a large feast in honor of his marriage to Herrat. However, she is troubled by a dream that her two sons are abducted by a dragon. Meanwhile, a new army is assembled at Etzelburg. Helche and Etzel's sons Orte and Scharpfe beg Helche to be allowed to join the army. Etzel and Dietrich come in upon this conversation, and Etzel categorically refuses. Dietrich, however, promises to take good care of the young princes, so that Helche agrees and Orte and Scharpfe join the army.
The army arrives in Italy, where it is greeted by Dietrich's loyal vassals who have remained there after the last campaign. Dietrich learns that Ermenrich has assembled a large army at Ravenna. The army heads to Bern (Verona), where Dietrich's young brother Diether has remained. Dietrich decides to leave Etzel's children with Diether in the care of the older warrior Elsan, and marches to Ravenna. The children, however, under the pretext of viewing the city, convince a reluctant Elsan to let them leave the city. They get lost and end up on the road to Ravenna, while Elsan looks for them in despair. Once the young warriors have spent a night outside the city, they reach the shore of the sea. In the dawn they encounter Witege. Diether tells Etzel's children that Witege is a warrior who betrayed Dietrich, and the three young warriors attack. Witege slays each of them in difficult combat; he is deeply distressed and laments Diether's death especially.
Meanwhile, Dietrich fights a gruelling twelve-day battle outside Ravenna, defeating Ermenrich, who escapes. His treacherous advisor Sibeche, however, is captured by Eckehart, who ties him naked to a horse and leads him across the battlefield to avenge the death of the Harlungen at Sibeche's advice. As the dead are gathered to be buried, Ilsan arrives with news that Etzel's sons are missing. The warrior Helpfrich then comes with news of their deaths. Dietrich finds their bodies on the seashore and breaks into despairing laments. He recognizes that the wounds on the young warriors bodies could only have been made by Witege's sword Mimming. Witege is then spotted; Dietrich jumps on his horse to attack, but Witege flees on his horse Schemming. Witege's uncle Rienolt, however, is also with him, and he turns to fight Dietrich and is slain. Dietrich pursues Witege to the edge of the sea and very nearly catches him, but Witege rides into the sea where he is rescued by the sea-spirit Wachilt (identified by the Thidrekssaga as his great grandmother). She tells him that Dietrich was so hot with anger that his armor was soft, and Witige could have easily defeated him. Now, however, the armor had hardened, and thirty Witiges could not defeat Dietrich. Dietrich meanwhile mourns on the shore. He goes back to Ravenna, where Ermenrich has fortified himself, and storms the city. Ermernich escapes, however, and Dietrich orders the city burned, as the inhabitants surrender. Rüdiger rides back to Hunland to bring Etzel the news of his sons deaths; however, Orte and Scharpfe's horses arrive at Etzelburg with bloody saddles. Helche is beside herself, but Rüdiger is able to calm her. Etzel sees that his sons deaths are not Dietrich's fault, and Dietrich returns to Etzel's court and back into Etzel and Helche's good graces.
Dating, creation, and transmission.
"Die Rabenschlacht" is transmitted together with "Dietrichs Flucht" in four complete manuscripts and alone in one fragmentary manuscript:
The origins of the earliest manuscripts as well as the dialect of the poem indicate that it was composed in Austria, sometime before 1300. Most modern scholarship holds "Die Rabenschlacht" to have been composed earlier than Dietrichs Flucht: Joachim Heinzle notes that "Die Rabenschlacht" contains allusions to Wolfram von Eschenbach's "Willehlam" (c. 1220) and cannot have been composed any earlier than that. Werner Hoffmann suggests that "Die Rabenschlacht" may have been composed around 1270, before being reworked and placed together with "Dietrichs Flucht" in the 1280s. Victor Millet questions whether "Die Rabenschlacht" is really an earlier work than "Dietrichs Flucht", and Elisabeth Lienert suggests that the poems were actually composed at roughly the same time, though older versions of "Die Rabenschlacht" must have existed.
As with almost all German heroic epic, "Die Rabenschlacht" is anonymous. Early scholarship believed that both "Dietrichs Fluch" and "Die Rabenschlacht" had a single author, Heinrich der Vogler; however, the formal and stylistic differences between the two epics have caused this theory to be abandoned. The manuscript transmission nevertheless makes clear that "Die Rabenschlacht" and "Dietrichs Flucht" were viewed as a single work by contemporaries. Someone, perhaps Heinrich der Vogler, has also reworked both texts to an extent so that their contents do not contradict each other.
Metrical form.
"Die Rabenschlacht" consists of 1140 unique stanzas, in a form that is not found in any other poem. Like other stanzaic heroic poems, it was probably meant to be sung, but no melody survives. Heinzle analyzes the stanza as consisting of three "Langzeilen" with rhymes at the caesuras: a||b, a||b, c||c. The first line consists of three metrical feet before the caesura, then three additional feet; the second of three feet before the caesura, then four additional feet; and the third of three feet before the caesura, and five or even six additional feet. Heinzle prints the following example as typical:
In some stanzas, the rhymes at the caesura in lines 1 and 2 are absent, giving a scheme: x|b, x|b, c|c. It is also possible to interpret the stanza as consisting of six shorter lines, with rhyme scheme ABABCC. Consequently, the same stanza as above is printed in the edition by Elisabeth Lienert and Dorit Wolter as:
Genre and themes.
"Die Rabenschlacht" has been described as "elegiac" and "sentimental," particularly in relation to "Dietrichs Flucht". Stylistically, the poem is notable for its hyperbole in its depictions of violence—the battle at Ravenna takes twelve days and the warriors literally wade in blood among mountains of corpses—and emotions, particularly of grief. The numbers of warriors involved are similarly exaggerated, with Ermenrich's army including 1,100,00 ("eilf hundert tūsent") warriors or more. Neither Werner Hoffmann nor Victor Millet see the poem as particularly heroic, with Millet nevertheless noting that the poem does not criticize the use of violence.
The poem makes numerous allusions to the "Nibelungenlied", beginning with the opening stanza, which cites the opening stanza of the C version of the "Nibelungenlied". Edward Haymes and Susan Samples suggest that the poem exists as a kind of prequel to the "Nibelungenlied." In the course of the poem, characters from the "Nibelungenlied" fight on the side of Ermenrich, including Siegfried, Gunther and Volker, as well as their enemies from the "Nibelungenlied", Liudegast and Liudeger. Siegfried is defeated by Dietrich and forced to plea for his life, confirming Dietrich's superiority. Michael Curschmann holds the encounters between Dietrich and Siegfried here and in the "Rosengarten zu Worms" to have their origins in an oral tradition. However, Elisabeth Lienert sees the battles in "Die Rabenschlacht" as part of a literary rivalry between the two traditions, an intertextual relationship. The poem includes allusions to other thirteenth-century literary texts as well, including Wolfram von Eschenbach's "Willehalm". This confirms its nature as a literary text, in dialogue with other literature.
Relation to oral tradition.
The general outline of the story told in "", about the death of Etzel and Herche's sons, is often considered to be one of the oldest components of the legend of Theodoric. It is first alluded to in the "Nibelungenklage", a poem likely written shortly after the "Nibelungenlied" (c. 1200). Older scholarship proposed a Gothic song as the earliest version. According to this theory, the song was inspired by the Battle of Nedao (454), a rebellion of Germanic tribes after the death of Attila the Hun, in which Attila's favorite son and successor Ellac died. Theodoric the Great's father Theodemar is thought to have fought on the side of the Huns in this battle, with his actions transferred to his more famous son in the oral tradition. Elisabeth Lienert suggests the poem's location at Ravenna may have been influenced by the historical Theodoric the Great besieging his enemy Odoacer there from 491 to 493. Witige's character is sometimes thought to have been influenced by Witigis, a Gothic king and usurper who surrendered Ravenna to the Byzantine army. Diether is similarly thought to have a connection to the historical Theodahad, whom Witigis betrayed, usurping the Ostrogothic throne. Werner Hoffmann suggests that Ermenrich's rather small role in "Die Rabenschlacht" is because the original tale of Witige killing Etzel's sons and Diether has been only roughly inserted into the larger framework of Dietrich's exile. Joachim Heinzle largely dismisses such attempts at deducing the roots of the poem as unfruitful.
An alternative version of the events of the "Rabenschlacht" is found in the Old Norse "Thidrekssaga". There we are told that King Ermanrik was misled into attacking his nephew Didrik because of his counsellor Sifka (Sibeche in Middle High German), who was avenging Ermanrik's rape of his wife by leading him to his doom. Didrik goes into exile at Attila's court and makes an attempt to return to his kingdom with a Hunnish army, bringing along his brother Thether (Diether) and Attila's two sons Erp and Ortwin. The army fights a mighty battle against Ermanrik at Gronsport on the Mosel and defeats him. During the battle, Wiðga (Witege) kills Thether, Erp, and Ortwin; Didrik pursues Wiðga, breathing fire, until the latter disappears in the (non-existent) mouth of the Mosel into the sea. Didrik throws his spear after Wiðga, and one can still see it today. Didrik then returns to exile. Joachim Heinzle notes that it is unclear how much of the variation between the version found in "Die Rabenschlacht" and that found in the "Thidrekssaga" is the work of the latter's compiler or comes from alternative versions in oral circulation. The late medieval Heldenbuch-Prosa corroborates the "Thidrekssaga"'s version of the story of why Sibeche betrayed Ermenrich, and it is clear that the composer of the Heldenbuch-Prosa did not have access to the "Thidrekssaga". This indicates that at least some of the "Thidrekssaga"'s changes may come from oral tradition, indicating the existence of multiple versions of the story. The scholar Norbert Voorwinden has suggested that the author of "Die Rabenschlacht" was largely unaware of the oral tradition, creating an entirely new work on the basis of an allusion to the death of Etzel's sons in the "Nibelungenklage".
Attempts have been made to connect the catalogues of warriors found in the work with signs of oral formulaic composition.

Donte DiVincenzo

Donte DiVincenzo (born January 31, 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the Villanova Wildcats. He won national championships with Villanova in 2016 and 2018. He was selected with the 17th overall pick by the Bucks in the 2018 NBA draft. In 2021, he won his first championship with the Milwaukee Bucks.
Early life and high school career.
DiVincenzo was born in Newark, Delaware, the son of John F. and Kathie DiVincenzo and has an older brother, John. Growing up, DiVincenzo played soccer before switching to basketball in high school. He attended the Salesianum School, where he led the team to two consecutive state championships. As a junior, he averaged 15.8 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game and played basketball in the Nike EYBL for Team Final. DiVincenzo averaged 22.9 points, 9.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists per game as a senior. He was named Delaware Sportswriters and Broadcasters Association's Boys' Basketball Player of the Year in 2015.
College career.
DiVincenzo appeared in nine games his true freshman year for Villanova before sitting out with a fractured fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot. The following season, in his redshirt freshman season, DiVincenzo averaged 8.8 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. He registered 19 points, three rebounds, and two assists in a 70–57 victory against St. John's on January 14, 2017. On March 9, DiVincenzo had a season-high 25 points to go with five rebounds and four assists in a 108–67 rematch win over St. John's. In the NCAA Tournament, he scored 21 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in a 76–56 victory over Mount St. Mary's in the first round. DiVincenzo was named to the Big East All-Freshman team and the Philadelphia Big Five Rookie of the Year.
In his redshirt sophomore season, DiVincenzo had a then career-high 30 points in an 86–75 win over Butler on February 10, 2018. At the conclusion of the regular season, he was named Big East Sixth Man of the Year. In the Elite Eight of the 2018 NCAA Tournament, DiVincenzo had 12 points and eight rebounds in a 71–59 win over Texas Tech. DiVincenzo was named the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player following their championship win over Michigan, in which he scored a career-high 31 points (including five three-point baskets) and recorded five rebounds, three assists and two blocked shots. In addition, he scored the most points in an NCAA Final Four game for a player coming off the bench.
DiVincenzo was dubbed the "Big Ragu" by sportscaster Gus Johnson following his last-second tip in a game on January 29, 2017, which gave Villanova the win against the University of Virginia. The nickname was given to him ostensibly due to his Italian heritage and his red hair. When Johnson came up with the nickname, he was probably referring to another "Big Ragu", a character named Carmine Ragusa on the 1970s–80s sitcom "Laverne &amp; Shirley", who was also Italian. On April 19, 2018, DiVincenzo announced he would declare for the 2018 NBA draft without hiring an agent, thereby leaving open the possibility of a return to Villanova. On May 29, 2018, DiVincenzo announced he would remain in the draft and hire an agent, forgoing his final two years of eligibility at Villanova.
Professional career.
Milwaukee Bucks (2018–present).
On June 21, 2018, DiVincenzo was selected with the 17th overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2018 NBA draft, the second of four Villanova players drafted that year. On July 10, 2018, the Milwaukee Bucks announced that they had signed DiVincenzo. He missed most of his rookie season with a foot injury. He scored a career-high 17 points in a win over the Minnesota Timberwolves in early November during his second season. 
On December 16, 2019, DiVincenzo scored 5 points, grabbed 10 rebounds, recorded 9 assists, and recorded 3 steals in a 120-116 loss to the Dallas Mavericks. On January, 16, 2020, DiVincenzo scored 19 points and recorded 3 rebounds in a 128-123 win against the Boston Celtics. That same season, he would record the 3rd highest defensive rating of any player in the league (teammate Giannis Antetokounmpo being 1st).
On May 4, 2021, DiVincenzo scored 10 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in a 124-118 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He ultimately received a championship ring as he was part of the 2021 team that won the NBA Finals, but did not play in any games after the first round of the playoffs due to a severe left ankle injury suffered against the Miami Heat. His injury was viewed as a hinderance to Milwaukee's ability to find postseason success, as they had not expected to play role players P. J. Tucker and Pat Connaughton so frequently.

Eckenlied

Das Eckenlied or Ecken Ausfahrt (The Song of Ecke or Ecke's Quest) is an anonymous 13th-century Middle High German poem about the legendary hero Dietrich von Bern, the counterpart of the historical Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great in Germanic heroic legend. It is one of the so-called fantastical ("aventiurehaft") Dietrich poems, so called because it more closely resembles a courtly romance than a heroic epic.
The "Eckenlied" tells the story of Dietrich's fight against the giant Ecke, who has been sent out by three queens to fetch Dietrich. Dietrich is forced to kill Ecke, after which he must fight Ecke's family, particularly Ecke's treacherous and vengeful brother Fasold. The poem exists in at least three separate but closely related versions, which offer different endings to the tale. A fragmentary text known as Dietrich und Fasold may represent another version of the "Eckenlied", but differences in meter and content make this uncertain. Fasold and the three queens may have originally been figures of Tyrolean folklore, while Ecke may have been invented to explain the name of Dietrich's sword, Eckesachs (sharp sword).
The "Eckenlied" is the earliest poem about Dietrich attested (c. 1230) after his appearance in the "Nibelungenlied". It was one of the most popular narratives about Dietrich throughout the Middle Ages and into the early modern period. It was first printed in 1490 and continued to be printed until the end of the 1500s.
Summary.
The "Eckenlied" begins with a conversion between three giants: Ecke, Fasold, and Ebenrot. Ecke proclaims that Dietrich von Bern is praised by everyone, while Ecke, despite having performed heroic deeds, is completely unknown. Ebenrot counters that Dietrich's reputation is a lie: the hero treacherously slew the giants Hilde and Grim while they were asleep to steal their armor. Fasold intervenes and says that Ebenrot is wrong: Dietrich slew Hilde and Grim because the giants would otherwise have killed him. Ecke decides to agree with Fasold. Meanwhile, three queens are on the mountain of Jochgrimm: one of them, Seburg wishes very much to see Dietrich, and hearing of Ecke's interest, asks him to bring the hero to her. To encourage Ecke not to kill Dietrich, Seburg gives Ecke a sword and armor hardened in dragon blood. It is the same armor that Emperor Ortnit wore when he rode out to fight dragons: Ortnit fell into a magic sleep, however, and was dragged away by a dragoness to her brood, which sucked his flesh out through the invincible armor. It was then recovered by Wolfdietrich, who killed the dragons, but himself had to go to a monastery to repent for his sins, being tortured by demons. From there Seburg got the armor. She tries to convince Ecke to take a horse, but he refuses.
Ecke travels to Verona, but is directed to Tyrol. After coming upon a man mortally wounded by Dietrich, Hilferich von Lunders (possibly Londres, i.e. London; in other versions he is described as von Lune and von Lütringen, i.e. Lotharingia), he finally encounters Dietrich himself, and challenges him to combat. Dietrich refuses, saying Ecke has done him no wrong, and Ecke accuses him of cowardice ("zagheit"). At this Dietrich agrees to fight. Ecke and Dietrich fight for a long time, and Ecke tries to force Dietrich to surrender, but Dietrich refuses. Finally, Dietrich gains the upper hand, but Ecke also refuses to surrender. Due to Ecke's invincible armor, Dietrich is forced to stab the giant dishonorably through a gap in his armor. He then mourns Ecke at some length. Ecke asks Dietrich to cut off his head and bring it to Seburg, which he does. He then puts on the giant's armor and takes his sword. In the Landsberger version, a nymph named Vrou Babehilt binds his wounds.
After recovering some from his wounds, Dietrich encounters a woman running through the forest. She is being hunted by Fasold, who rides up and demands to know why Dietrich is interfering with his hunt. Fasold is described as having two long braided locks that hang down to his waist and which are woven in with iron. The giant decides not to fight the still gravely wounded Dietrich, apparently not recognizing his brother's armor or seeing Ecke's head. Dietrich falls asleep while the maiden watches. However, Fasold changes his mind and returns in the night – the maiden is barely able to rouse Dietrich before Fasold appears with his hounds. The two fight, and Dietrich overcomes Fasold by cutting off his braided locks, and the giant surrenders. However, he then recognizes his brother's armor and Dietrich admits to having killed Ecke, and the two fight once more. Dietrich accuses Fasold of fighting with the strength of two men, saying Ecke's spirit has entered the giant, at which Fasold counters that Diether's spirit must have entered Dietrich, he is so strong. At the memory of Witige's treachery, Dietrich is enraged and finally overcomes Fasold, sparing him only at the insistence of the maiden.
At this point the three texts diverge – in all, Fasold treacherously leads Dietrich to members of his family in hopes that they will kill him, taking him to the giant Eckenot (whose name may be a corruption of Ebenrot or vice versa) and then to two or three giantesses, variously Ecke's mother, aunt, or sisters. The oldest nearly complete version, E2 breaks off at this point. In the remaining two complete versions E7 and e1, Dietrich finally kills Fasold for his treacherous behavior In version E7, which is probably the original ending, he then rides into Jochgrimm and throws the head of Ecke at the feet of Seburg, saying that she is the cause of Ecke's pointless death. In version e1, Seburg reveals that she sent Ecke to his death deliberately, since he and his brothers were going to force them into marriage. It also mentions that, with Ecke's sword Dietrich later slew Odoacer when called upon to do so by Emperor Zeno.
Transmission, versions, and dating.
The "Eckenlied" is transmitted in numerous manuscripts and printed versions, beginning in 1230. The poem was likely composed shortly before that time, possibly in Tyrol. As with almost all German heroic epic, it is anonymous. It was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich.
In common with all fantastical Dietrich poems, the "Eckenlied" is characterized by a great deal of variation in its transmission, so that each manuscript essentially represents an parallel and equally valid version of the poem. The three principle versions are E2 (c. 1300, incomplete), E7 (1472), and e1 (printed 1491). The oldest attestation, E1, a single stanza in the Codex Buranus, appear to show that the poem existed in a much shorter version, beginning with Ecke's encounter with Dietrich in the forest. It is possible that this is the original beginning of the poem, with everything before this encounter being added later. Although version E7 is from the fifteenth century, various fragments and depictions in Runkelstein Castle make it likely that similar versions existed in the first half of the fourteenth century. Similarly, parts of a version similar to the incomplete E2 were copied into a printed text of the "Eckenlied" by fifteenth century scribe Konrad Bollstatter. All versions thus existed at the same time and should be treated equally.
Each manuscript or print is listed below according to the version of the "Eckenlied" it contains as named by Joachim Heinzle.
Manuscripts:
The first printing represents an independent version:
There follow more than eleven further printings into the sixteenth century and beyond.
The fragmentary "Dietrich und Fasold" is transmitted on three small strips of a manuscript from around 1300 that were used as bookbinding in Niedersächsische Landesbibliothek Hanover MS VII 626.
Themes.
The "Eckenlied" is often interpreted as a critique of courtly love service: Ecke foolishly rides out on behalf of Seburg, which results in his death and extreme hardship for Dietrich. Dietrich's "zagheit" (cowardice), a common motif in the fantastical Dietrich poems, functions here as a criticism of Ecke's insistence on fighting. Victor Millet sees in this criticism a disavowal of the knightly battles on behalf of women commonly portrayed in courtly romance. On the other hand, version e1 removes any criticism of love service and thus moves the epic much closer to romance. At the same time, Dietrich's brutal killing of Ecke casts heroic battle in a bad light, except in version E7, where Dietrich's innocence is emphasized to a greater degree.
Particularly the opening conversation of the poem is frequently seen as a metaliterary discussion about the status of Dietrich as a hero: Ecke, Fasolt, Ebenrot, and Seburg all desire to verify Dietrich's fame, in the same manner as the audience might.
The "Eckenlied" also alludes to themes from the historical Dietrich poems, particularly events recounted in the "Rabenschlacht": when Dietrich fights Fasold, Fasold taunts Dietrich with the death of Dietrich's brother Diether and Etzel's sons at the hands of Witege. Fasold implicitly compares Dietrich to Witege, as Fasold seeks to avenge his own brother's death. Meanwhile, Dietrich's successful defeat of Fasold avenges his failure to avenge his own brother and also allows him to get past his problematic victory over Ecke. Dietrich's defeat of the giants, who can be seen as personifying injustice, helps prove his qualities as an ideal ruler, something which e1 explicitly connects to the historical Theoderic's defeat of Odoacer and rule in Italy.
Older scholarship believed that the "Eckenlied" had been heavily influenced by an Old French Arthurian romance "Le Chevalier du Papagau," in which Arthur fights against a similar giant antagonist. An earlier "native" poem about Ecke would thus have been rewritten to incorporate plot elements from this romance. More recent scholarship has abandoned this connection, viewing the similarities as superficial.
Metrical Form.
Like the majority of German heroic epics, the "Eckenlied" is written in stanzas. The poem is composed in a stanza form known as the "Berner Ton," which consists of 13 lines in the following rhyme scheme: aabccbdedefxf. It shares this metrical form with the poems "Goldemar", "Sigenot", and "Virginal". Early modern melodies for the "Berner Ton" have survived, indicating that it was meant to be sung. Heinzle gives the first stanza of the "Eckenlied" as a typical example:
In the earliest version, E1, there is a slight variation in how the stanza is put together, with the lines pattern instead as: aabccbxexefxf. Heinzle interprets this to mean that the lines without rhymes were originally the first half of a caesura in a "Langzeile," the same line unit used in the Nibelungenlied. This features three or four feet, a caesura, then an additional three or four feet, depending on placement in the stanza. Printed this way, the stanza from the Codex Buranus (cited according to Vollmann's edition) appears thus:
"Dietrich und Fasold" appears to be written either in the same stanza as the "Nibelungenlied", or else in the "Hildebrandston"—it is not clear from the fragmentary nature of the text.
Relation to the Oral Tradition.
The "Eckenlied", together with "Sigenot" are the only attestations of a story-possibly a lost poem-about the giants Hilde and Grim, from whom Dietrich won his helmet, named "Hildegrim." The tale is told in its entirely only in the Old Norse Thidrekssaga, which used German sources. It is also possible that there may never have been a written poem about Hilde and Grim; the tale may have been a purely oral one and well known to the "Eckenlied's" and "Sigenot's" audience.
The poem is often interpreted as an explanation of the name of Dietrich's sword, Eckesachs. This originally meant "sword with a sharp edge", but when "ecke" took on the meaning it has in modern German (corner), the name was reinterpreted as meaning "the sword of Ecke". The name Eckesachs never appears in the text however, though the sword is referred to as "Hern Ecken sachs" (Sir Ecke's sword). Eckesachs was apparently famous enough to be referenced in Heinrich von Veldeke's Eneis (c. 1186), which predates the Eckenlied. Heinzle does not believe that this early mention is any proof of an oral story about Ecke. 
Whether or not Ecke has a long existence in oral tradition, Fasolt and Seburg are more commonly supposed to have. They are commonly connected to a 17th-century prayer to witches at the mountain Jochgrimm outside of Bozen to cause "ffasolt" to send storms far away. This would make the three queens in the "Eckenlied" into witches with power over the weather, while Fasolt would be a storm demon. Fasolt's long hair is also taken as evidence of his demonic origins: The name "Fasolt" likely derives from a root similar to Old High German "faso", thread, and most likely refers to his long braided hair. If this interpretation is correct, than Fasolt and Ecke were not originally brothers, but Ecke was inserted into a much older story. Heinzle, however, dismisses the weather prayer: its source is unclear and neither is it clear that "ffasolt" is the same as the Fasolt found in the "Eckenlied" Fasolt may also be a sort of reversal of versions of a legend in which Dietrich von Bern is leader of the Wild Hunt and hunts women in the forest: Dietrich instead fights against an opponent with this characteristic, as he also does in the "Wunderer" and "Virginal".
Further evidence for an oral version of the tale might be provided by the Ekka episode Thidrekssaga, which differs in crucial details in both its treatment of Ecke and Fasold. Additionally, the fragmentary "Dietrich und Fasold" appears to match neither the meter nor the content of the Eckenlied. Particularly because of the version found in the Thidrekssaga, Victor Millet believes that it is highly likely that there were oral tales circulating about Ecke. Heinzle, however, is doubtful that any such oral tradition exists: he suggests rather that the Ekka episode was altered by the compiler of the Thidrekssaga.
Reception.
The "Eckenlied" was one of the most popular poems about Dietrich, with one or possibly two of Dietrich's giantess opponents from the Dresden version being included to in the frescoes at Runkelstein Castle (c. 1400). Ecke is frequently mentioned as Dietrich's opponent when authors make allusions to the legends about Dietrich. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the poem even seems to have inspired a saying, "Ecke ist an den Berner geraten" (Ecke has met the Berner [i.e. Dietrich]), meaning that someone has met their match.

Stephan Ambrosius

Stephan Kofi Ambrosius (born 18 December 1998) is a German professional footballer who plays as a defender for 2. Bundesliga club Hamburger SV.
Born in Hamburg to Ghanaian parents, Ambrosius joined the Hamburger SV youth academy in 2012. He made his professional debut in the Bundesliga in March 2018. He is also a German youth international.
Early years.
Stephan Ambrosius was born in Hamburg to Ghanaian parents. He grew up in the quarter of Wilhelmsburg.
Club career.
Hamburger SV.
Youth.
Ambrosius started playing football at the age of 5 at local club Einichkeit Wilhelmsburg, before moving to SV Wilhelmsburg and finally FC St. Pauli. In 2012, at the age of 13, Pauli moved to the Hamburger SV youth academy. At HSV, he progressed through all the youth teams until 2017 and played, among other things, in the Under 17 and Under 19 Bundesliga. For the 2017–18 season, Ambrosius was promoted to the second team, Hamburger SV II, and competed in the fourth-tier Regionalliga.
2017–18 season.
In early February 2018, Ambrosius was promoted to the professional squad by head coach Bernd Hollerbach. On 10 February 2018, he was called up for the first team squad for his first Bundesliga game, but did not make an appearance in the 0–2 defeat away at Borussia Dortmund. He made his Bundesliga debut on 31 March 2018 in a 1–1 away draw against VfB Stuttgart under new head coach Christian Titz, who had taken over the reigns in early March. Ambrosius debuted in the starting lineup and was substituted at half-time for Rick van Drongelen. This proved to be his only appearance during the season, which saw HSV suffer relegation to the 2. Bundesliga for the first time in club history. For the second team, Ambrosius made 20 appearances and scored one goal.
2018–19 season.
Ahead of the 2018–19 season, Ambrosius signed his first professional contract running until 30 June 2021. In the first half of the new season, he was behind Rick van Drongelen, David Bates and Léo Lacroix in the depth chart, and neither under Titz nor under his successor Hannes Wolf he made an appearance in the 2. Bundesliga, instead only playing in the DFB-Pokal besides his 15 appearances for the second team in the Regionalliga Nord. In December 2018, Ambrosius suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury, sidelining him for the rest of the season.
2019–20 season.
In the 2019–20 pre-season, Ambrose was demoted to the second team by the new head coach Dieter Hecking. There, he immediately established himself as a starter again. In February 2020, Ambrosius returned to first-team practice as Gideon Jung was utilised in defensive midfield following the injury of Adrian Fein and only Ewerton was available alongside central defenders Rick van Drongelen and Timo Letschert. After Jung received a red card on 29 February against Erzgebirge Aue and Ewerton suffered a long-term injury, Ambrosius was included in the first-team squad for the matchup against SSV Jahn Regensburg on 7 March for the first time that season. On the last matchday of the season, he made his first and only league appearance that season in the 1–5 home defeat to SV Sandhausen and received a "satisfactory" score by sports magazine "kicker", the best score of a field player on a desolate HSV team. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Ambrosius made only 17 appearances (15 appearances as a starter) in the Regionalliga, before the season was cancelled.
International career.
Although born in Hamburg, Ambrosius was eligible to play for Ghana due to his parents being from the country. Due to numerous cancellations in his playing position by Nico Schlotterbeck and Maxim Leitsch, Ambrosius was called up by Germany under-21 coach Stefan Kuntz in early October 2020. However, as Ambrosius tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, he was unable to participate in the 2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification matches against Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Ambrosius finally made his debut for the under-21 side in November 2020.

Greene 1910 Biplane

In early 1910, Dr. William Greene designed, built and sold the successor to his own 1909 biplane in Mineola, Long Island at the Aeronautic Society's facility. This aircraft was a fairly conventional biplane in the Farman style. By mid April 1910, Greene had left New York City and moved to Rochester, NY to start a company to produce aircraft of his own design.
Design and development.
Greene built the first of his 1910 biplanes for Roy W. Crosby of San Francisco, CA. This aircraft was originally equipped with a Curtiss motor but on later models, he used the Elbridge 2-stroke Featherweight motor instead. The aircraft was designed to provide lateral control in a way that avoided the Wright brothers patent. It was equipped with a single forward elevator and a horizontal stabilizer with a movable rudder in the rear. The elevator was wired to work in conjunction with a flap that was attached to the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer. Ailerons were attached to the rear wing struts and were actuated by a Curtiss style shoulder control. Later models had wingspans of and

North Bali International Airport

North Bali International Airport (; commonly abbreviated as "NBIA"), is a proposed airport on the island of Bali, Indonesia, located at Kubutambahan, in the "kabupaten" (regency) of Buleleng. It is a project initiated by the Governor of Bali, Made Mangku Pastika, on 9 July 2015.
Airport.
With a capacity of 32 million passengers, NBIA will be Indonesia's second largest airport. Built entirely on the sea, the site will be divided into two parts: the Aerotropolis and the airport. The latter will consist of a main terminal and three boarding satellites, and will have two parallel runways, a heliport and a seaport. The site will also include a cargo terminal and maintenance area.
Planning.
The beginnings.
The Ministry of National Development Planning has included in its PPP Book 2013 (Public - Private Partnerships), a programme for the development of a new airport in North Bali under project code D-001-10-004.
This project consists of relieving congestion at Ngurah Rai International Airport. Bali Province is one of Indonesia's largest tourist attractions. The only airport, located in the South, welcomed nearly 20 million passengers in 2017 and is expected to grow by 8% the following year. The Local Government considers that a new airport will reduce traffic congestion in Denpasar municipality and Nusa Dua district.
Year 2015.
After studying several concepts, the Governor of Bali selected an airport at sea project in his letter of recommendation No. 553/11583/DPIK of 9 July 2015.
This project proposes to develop a THKON Aerotropolis in Kubutambahan in the Buleleng Regency. THKON comes from the term Tri Hita Karana. It is a new urban development strategy in accordance with an ancient Balinese tradition based on quality of life.
Year 2018.
The project of construction on the sea was the culmination of many political debates which led to an extension of the feasibility studies. The subject of the debates is equity between North and South Bali. The Governor asks for a balance in the development plan of the two zones.
In March 2018, the Coordinating Minister of Maritime Affairs, Luhut Panjaitan, gave the go-ahead for a feasibility study at the chosen location.
At the same time, expansion of the existing airport as well as transport links between the north and the south of the island are being prioritised by the Transport Minister, Budi Karya Sumadi.
