Victor Lavy

Victor Chaim Lavy is an Israeli economist and professor at the University of Warwick and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. His research interests include labour economics, the economics of education, and development economics. Lavy belongs to the most prominent education economists in the world.
Biography.
Victor Lavy earned a B.A. in economics from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1974, followed by a M.A. and a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago in 1977 and 1979, respectively. Since his graduation, Lavy has continuously worked at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, first as a lecturer in economics (1979–84), then as a senior lecturer (1985–89), before becoming a professor in 1990 and being made the William Haber Professor of Economics in 1997. In parallel, Lavy worked and continues to work in the United Kingdom, where he was a chaired professor of economics first at Royal Holloway, University of London (2006–11) and has been holding the same position at the University of Warwick since 2011. Additionally, Lavy has held visiting appointments at the University of Pennsylvania, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the Centre for Economic Performance (LSE), Stanford University and the Hoover Institution.
Lavy maintains a number of academic affiliations, including with the Bureau for Research in the Economic Analysis of Development (BREAD), where he is a board member, and NBER, CEPR, CEP, IZA, and the IGC, where he holds positions as research fellow or associate. Moreover, Lavy is member of the AEA, Econometric Society, Royal Economic Society, and Society of Labor Economists. Besides his academic career, Lavy has repeatedly worked as an economist and consultant for the World Bank as well as for Israel's Ministry of Education. Finally, he also performs editorial duties at the "American Economic Journal: Applied Economics" (since 2016) and at "Labour Economics" (since 2006) and has done so in the past for "Economic Development and Cultural Change".
Research.
Victor Lavy's research interests include labour economics, development economics and the economics of education. According to IDEAS/RePEc, Victor Lavy belongs to the top 2% of most cited economists worldwide. Many of Lavy's publications are co-authored with Joshua Angrist and typically exploit natural experiments to estimate economic outcomes such as the returns to schooling. In particular, cooperations between Lavy and Angrist of that type include Lavy's highest cited article - "Using Maimonides' Rule to Estimate the Effect of Class Size on Children's Academic Achievement", for which Lavy and Angrist received the 2nd place at the 2000 Griliches Prize for Empirical Economics.
Development economics.
Throughout the mid-1990s, Lavy performed field research on health and education in several developing countries, including Morocco, Côte d'Ivoire, Pakistan, and Ghana. Analysing how the quality of healthcare in Ghana affects the health of rural children, he (together with John Strauss, Duncan Thomas and Philippe de Vreyer) finds that making birth services and other related child programmes more widely available and improving water and sanitation infrastructure would likely strongly reduce the mortality rates of children in rural areas. In another study in Ghana, wherein Lavy studies the effect of introducing gradually increasing school fees, he finds that the schedule of these fees affects schoolchildren's educational choices in lower grades. In the Côte d'Ivoire, Lavy, Thomas and Strauss analyse the impact of economic adjustment programmes implemented in the 1980s and find that these programmes likely adversely affected the health of Ivorians by making health care services - especially immunizations - less available as well as of poorer quality and by increasing relative food prices. In Morocco, Angrist and Lavy exploit the change of Morocco's language of instruction from French to Arabic in 1983 to estimate the returns to learning French and find that the policy substantially reduced young Moroccans' returns to schooling by deteriorating their French writing skills. Finally, in Pakistan, Lavy, Harold Alderman, Jere R. Behrman and Rekha Menon investigate the impact of child health (proxied by nutrition) on school enrollment and find the effect of child health to be three times as large as conventional estimates in the literature suggest when child health is taken to be exogenous instead of being the result of households' decision.
In more recent work, Lavy, Eric Hanushek and Kohtaro Hitomi study how school quality in Egypt affects the dropout rates of students, with regard to which they find that - student ability and achievement held constant - students are much less likely to remain in school if they attend a low-quality school.
Economics of education.
Since the late 1990s, the focus of Lavy's work has shifted towards the economics of education, including the study of determinants of student achievement and the evaluation of means to increase student achievement. In his most-cited study, Lavy (with Joshua Angrist) uses the application of Maimonides' rule in Jewish schools to estimate the effect of class size on student achievement in a quasi-regression discontinuity design and finds that class size reductions significantly and substantially increase the student achievements of fourth and fifth graders, though not of third graders. Another important educational input studied by Lavy (with Angrist) are classroom computers and their use for computer-aided instruction (in Israel); however, Lavy and Angrist conclude that the introduction of computer-aided instruction didn't improve education in a way that translated into higher student test scores.
Performance-based incentive schemes for teachers and students.
Another substantial body of Lavy's work on education economics concerns the effect of financial incentives for teachers and students on learning outcomes. With regard to performance-based incentives for teachers, Lavy finds evidence in Israel that offering teachers group performance incentives is much more cost effective in terms of improving student performance than providing schools with additional conventional resources. Similarly, in an evaluation of the impact of individual cash bonuses for teachers for improving their students' performance in matriculation exams in Israel, Lavy finds them to significantly improve test attendance, conditional pass rates and mean test scores, an effect that is likely due to more appropriate teaching methods, improved after-school teaching, and teachers being more responsive to students' needs. Based on his research on performance-based teacher pay, Lavy has offered guidelines for the implementation of corresponding schemes in education systems, including close monitoring of teachers to prevent cheating, the importance of attainable goals, the restriction of incentives to a few "winners", and the alignment of individual and school level performance incentives. Finally, Lavy and Angrist have also conducted research on the effect of cash incentives for students on these students' performance in matriculation exams; while they found that the incentives induced girls to devote more time to exam preparation and thereby improved their certification rates, it was completely ineffective for boys.
Immigration and education.
Lavy has also studied the emigration of Jews to Israel and the impact of their arrival on educational outcomes. For example, exploiting the sudden emigration of 15,000 Ethiopian Jews through Operation Solomon in 1991, Lavy, Eric Gould and Daniele Paserman find that the quality of immigrants' early school environment in Israel considerably affected high school dropout and class repetition rates as well as matriculation certification rates. In another study with Gould and Paserman, Lavy studies the sudden arrival of Jews from the Soviet Union in Israel after the fall of the Iron Curtain in 1991 and finds that the presence of immigrants negatively affected the long-term educational outcomes of natives by decreasing their matriculation certification rates.
Quantity-quality trade-off for children.
Together with Joshua Angrist and Analia Schlosser, Lavy exploits widespread parental preferences for mixed sibling compositions and ethnic differences therein in Israel to assess the relationship between household fertility and children's education; they don't find any evidence for a trade-off between quantity and quality.
Peer effects in education.
More recently, Lavy has studied the role of gender and ability peer effects in education in the United Kingdom and Israel. With regard to gender peer effects in Israeli elementary, middle and high schools, Lavy and Analia Schlosser find that increasing the proportion of girls in a class improves male and female pupils' cognitive outcomes by decreasing classroom disruption and violence, improving inter-student and student-teacher relationships, and decreasing teachers' fatigue, though the change in composition in itself doesn't affect individual behaviour. With regard to ability peer effects, Lavy, Olmo Silva and Felix Weinhardt find that bad peers in English schools tend to drag down all their classmates' performance, but that good peers only benefit girls but not boys. This result is largely replicated in Israel, where Lavy, Schlosser and Daniele Paserman study the effect of the proportion of low achievers in a class on their peers and find again a negative impact of bad peers on their classmates, especially on classmates who are low achievers themselves, mostly by disrupting teachers' teaching, deteriorating inter-student and student-teacher relationships, and making violence and classroom disruptions more likely to happen.

CAR-15 XM177

The CAR-15 XM177 or CAR-15 Commando was a part of the CAR-15 Military Weapons System designed in 1966 in response to the US military's desire for a compact M16 variant to improve on the inadequacies of earlier shortened M16 types.
Development history.
Although the United States had already tested the CAR-15 Model 607 submachine gun in Vietnam, it had a number of shortcomings, including overwhelming muzzle blast and an overly complicated, unreliable collapsible stock. To address these problems, Colt came up with the XM177, which featured a number of improvements. The triangular collapsible stock was replaced with a much simpler two-position telescoping tubular aluminum buttstock, while the fragile improvised handguards of the Model 607 were replaced by reinforced round handguards. Each half of the round handguard is identical, simplifying logistics by not requiring a top/bottom or left/right pair. The "Model 609" Commando has a forward assist, while the "Model 610" Commando does not. A "Model 610B" with a four-position selector was available, but not used by the U.S. military. All versions are equipped with the long moderator.
Features.
The XM177 uses a unique flash hider sometimes called a flash or sound moderator for its barrel. This device is long and was designed to reduce - that is, "to moderate" - the excessive muzzle flash and report of such a short-barreled weapon down to something more comparable to the sound and flash produced by the 20-inch barreled M16 and M16A1 while simultaneously increasing gas pressure at the gas port and improving dwell time to improve the reliability of a weapon with such a short length of barrel past the gas port (this latter function being similar to the muzzle devices used on the Soviet AKS-74U "submachine gun" and later Russian AK-102, -104, and -105 carbines and therefore the later American copies of these designs, such as the Noveske KX3 and KX5 family of muzzle devices). 
The Model 610 was classified as the "XM177" but adopted by the Air Force as the "GAU-5/A" Submachine Gun (GAU = Gun, Aircraft, fully-assembled Unit). The Army purchased 2,815 Model 609 CAR-15 Commandos on June 28, 1966, which were officially designated Submachine Gun, 5.56 mm, "XM177E1". As part of the contract, Colt was supposed to supply each XM177E1 with seven 30-round magazines, but Colt was unable to build a reliable 30-round curved magazine that would fit in the M16 magazine well, so most XM177E1s were shipped with 20-round magazines. The exception was 5th Special Forces Group, who received a total of four early 30-round magazines. Colt completed delivery of the purchased XM177E1s in March 1967.
In 1967, in response to field testing, Colt lengthened the Commando's barrel from . The increased length reduced noise and muzzle flash, and allowed fitting of the Colt XM148 grenade launcher. A metal boss was added to the moderator for mounting of the XM148 and rifle grenades. The chambers were chrome-plated. The Commandos with the longer barrels were called the "Model 629" and "Model 649". The Model 629 Commando has a forward assist; the Model 649 Commando does not.
In April 1967, the Army purchased 510 Colt 629 Commandos for use by troops assigned to the Military Assistance Command, Vietnam Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG), and designated them "XM177E2". Delivery was completed by the end of September 1967. The Air Force adopted a similar model without the forward assist feature as the "GAU-5A/A". Sources debate whether or not this was a Colt Model 630 or 649. According to John Plaster and other sources, the lack of 30-round magazines continued to be problematic and SOG operators resorted to pooling their personal resources and purchasing the larger capacity magazines on the civilian U.S. market. Problems with range, accuracy, barrel fouling, and usage of tracer bullets continued to plague the XM177 series, but Colt estimated that it would take a six-month $400,000 program to do a complete ballistic and kinematic study. There were also recommendations for a 29-month $635,000 research and development program. Both recommendations were declined by the U.S. military as American ground force involvement in the Vietnam War was gradually winding down. Production of the CAR-15 Commando ended in 1970.
It is rumored that the People's Army of Vietnam's M-18 was designed based on XM177 carbines seized from dead or wounded American and South Vietnamese soldiers in the Vietnam War. They were first seen in public in 2010, made by Z111 Factory.
Derivatives.
GUU-5/P.
The United States Air Force has made ad hoc upgrades to its GAU-5/As and GAU-5A/As. The barrels and moderators were replaced with the longer barrel with a 1-in-12 twist, but the weapons retained their original designations. With the change to M855 cartridges, they received either a new barrel with a 1:7 twist ratio or complete upper receiver assembly replacements. The GAU-5/A or GAU-5A/A markings were removed and the weapons redesignated "GUU-5/P". They also retain automatic fire instead of burst.
The new designation more accurately reflected the weapon's place in the U.S. Air Force Aerospace Equipment Type Designation System (AETDS). The weapons had initially been designated in the same format as aircraft guns, being placed in the GA category (GA designating an aircraft gun, with U meaning unit, representing a complete system and not part of a kit), followed by the /A suffix meaning the system was for aircraft. GUU is the "guns, miscellaneous personal equipment" category, and the /P suffix indicating personal equipment.

Peter Kharischirashvili

Peter Kharischirashvili (in Georgian: პეტრე ხარისჭირაშვილი / ხარისჭარაშვილი, born in 1804 or 1805 in Akhaltsikhe, Russian Empire – 7 October 1890 in Constantinople) was a Georgian
Catholic monk, theologian and public figure, scientist and founder of the Servites of the Immaculate Conception in Istanbul.
Biography.
Early years.
Peter Kharischirashvili was born in 1804 or 1805 in Akhaltsikhe, according to most sources. According to his tombstone, Kharischirashvili was born on May 2, 1818, which is the date accepted by Zakaria Chichinadze. Meanwhile, other sources give his birth date as April 20, 1818.
He studied at the parochial school and later went to study at the seminary in Gyumri, and finally to Rome to study Superior Theology.
Priesthood and last years in Georgian lands.
In 1842 he returned to Akhaltsikhe, there he was ordained, and was appointed assistant archimandrite to Pavle Shahqulianis. His return to Georgia also meant an awareness and a determination to fight so that the Georgian Catholics could worship God in their language.
Kharischirashvili captivated his faithful thanks to his eloquent preaching. Despite obeying the law and celebrating in Armenian, he preached in Georgian. He worked hard to improve the situation of his people, exempting the dowry for women with few resources, and teaching people to read and write. His authority, however, aroused suspicions among the Armenians. The tensions reached their highest point when the Armenians announced the decision to build a seminary at Akhaltsikhe and Shahqulianis supported them. Kharischirashvili faced him and, finally was sent to Khizabavra, and from there to Vale.
In the 1850s he was transferred to Khizabavra (today's Aspindza region).
Sacerdotal life abroad.
In 1856 he marched to Venice, where he joined the Mekhitarist Congregation and founded a Georgian press and published a number of significant historical and theological books in the Georgian language on St. Lazarus Island. Kharischirashvili also translated books from Armenian, which he has reconciled with that community. Thanks to his work, the Holy See allowed him to found in Constantinople a new Georgian religious congregation on May 7, 1859 in Constantinople and also a typikon there. Upon his arrival he founded the congregation of the Servites of the Immaculate Conception and began to celebrate the liturgy in Georgian. A female monastery and a Catholic school were also founder. Each year the school had more than 100 students, many of them Georgian slaves repurchased by Kharischirashvili himself, and others who came from Georgia. His work also attracted Orthodox and Muslim Georgians.
In 1861, Kharischirashvili founded a church to Georgian Catholics in one of the most prestigious districts of Istanbul.
Kharischirashvili spoke eight languages, but he paid particular attention to Georgian teaching. In addition to theological work, his congregation and school also had a significant presence in the Georgian language and grammar, literature and history, and students were also introduced to Latin and French. Their pupils were aware of the excerpts from The Knight in the Panther's Skin. 
Of the school were students, among others, Michel Tamarati and Mikheil Tarkhnishvili. In 1870 he founded a new Georgian press in Constantinople, and many of the books distributed free of charge to poor people. He paid special attention to the fact that the editions were careful and were grammatically correct. Among the published works is the publication of poetry "ყვავილების კონა" (qvavilebis kona). The good march of the congregation caused that a new house and printer in Montauban (France) also had been opened in that decade. Only in 1877-81, this printout was printed and spread over 25 different books in Georgia. The Georgian language was used to protect the purity of the Georgian language and started to draw grammar. While the Georgian Orthodox Church had confiscated its autocephaly and did not participate in the development of Georgian language and literature, the Istanbul monastery continued the work of Gregory of Khandzta.
Death.
He died on October 7, 1890 in Istanbul (other sources say October 9). His headstone says:

Black Mountain Archeological District

The Black Mountain Archeological District is a region of the Bighorn Basin near Shell, Wyoming that contains archeological sites associated with chert deposits used in making tools and weapons. Covering , the area was occupied from about 11,500 years ago in the Paleoindian Period to the Late Prehistoric Period of 1500 to 400 years ago. The sites have not yielded more recent artifacts. The area contains six rock shelters, two campsites at canyon bottoms and one interfluve campsite, as well as the Black Mountain and East Spring Creek chert quarries. The local chert comes from the Phosphoria Formation, and is red in color. The district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 2, 1987.

The Funerary Monument of Lusius Storax is a temple tomb of the early Roman Imperial period, preserved in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale d'Abruzzo in Chieti. The monument consists of two reliefs, a frieze and a pediment, which are dated between AD 30 and 50 on epigraphic and stylistic grounds (like the type of armour worn by the gladiators). The tomb's occupant, Gaius Lusius Storax, was a freedman who became a "sevir Augustalis" of Teate (modern Chieti) following the administrative reforms of Augustus.
Frieze.
The frieze depicts a gladiatorial game, which the rich Lucius must have organised on the occasion of his election. The gladiators are depicted in various poses (saluting, preparing, fighting, victorious, and defeated), as if part of a single scene, although in reality the various stages would actually happen sequentially. The goal of the donor must have been to document the sumptuousness of the games, whose cost was proportional to the number of combatants involved. The relief is composed with a careful equilibrium and rhythmic pattern of movement. The background is neutral and the details of the figures are developed with care, especially the musculature and drapery. The style has been thought to be inspired directly by models from the city of Rome.
Pediment.
The scene on the pediment is more crowded and seems to depicted a single, real event, namely the investiture of Lusius Storax as "sevir Augustalis". There are two levels, one on top of the other. At the sides are two groups of musicians: "cornicines" at right and "tubicines" at left. At lower left on the first level, there is a seat with three young men, likely three "camilli" who symbolise the sacrifices connected with the investiture ceremony. The centre is occupied by the "tribunal", with Storax at the centre and two "bisellia" (seats for honoured Romans) at his sides, in which the Quadrumvirs of Teate sit, flanked by a standing lictor. A man with a stick (an augur or a lanista) stands at right, balancing the three "camilli".
The upper level of the pediment has a colonnade in the background, probably the forum of Teate (site of the games depicted on the frieze). Eleven togate men stand on this level, who are the college of "seviri Augustales", six leaving office at the end of their term and five entering office (the sixth being Storax), as well as a lictor. One of the "seviri" bends to say something in Storax's ear. Two of them stand at right counting the money in a box, symbolising the payment of the "summa honoraria" by Storax, although this scrutiny would not actually have taken place during the games.
At the far left of the upper level, there is a compressed scene of a woman with arms wide open and a man punching another man in the face. This might be a depiction of a small brawl which occurred during the games, similar to the riot of the Pompeians and the Nucerians in AD 59.
Plebeian art.
The work is an interesting document of a strand of less refined and non-official Roman art, which Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli termed 'Plebeian art', which gradually became the main style of art used by the Roman state over the course of the first three centuries AD. Key features are the depiction of a series of events as part of a single scene, the use of a squashed perspective, the larger size of key individuals, the depiction of games in a lower register. These recur in 4th century imperial artworks like the Arch of Constantine and the pedestal of the Obelisk of Theodosius.

Balkan Shadows

Balkan Shadows (), also known as Black Sun, is a Serbian period crime television series created by Dragan Bjelogrlić. In addition to Bjelogrlić, contributors to the screenplay include Danica Pajović, Dejan Stojiljković and Vladimir Kecmanović. The screenplay is based on a story by Stevan Koprivica. The series is a co-production involving Cobra Film, Radio Television of Serbia, Skopje Film Studio, Iskra, Radio Television of the Republic of Srpska, Macedonian Radio Television and The Film Agency of North Macedonia.
The series is set in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes during the Interwar period and follows the story of two Belgrade police department inspectors. The first season is set during the period just before the 6 January Dictatorship and follows attempts by the couple to solve a string of sacrificial murders shaking Belgrade.
Dragan Bjelogrlić, Andrija Kuzmanović, Marija Bergam, Goran Bogdan, Aleksandr Galibin, Nenad Jezdić, Gordan Kičić, Nebojša Dugalić, Branimir Brstina, Srđan Todorović, Dragan Petrović, Nikola Đuričko, Bogdan Diklić, Voja Brajović, Sebastian Cavazza and Toni Mihajlovski are in the lead roles. The first season ran from 22 October 2017 to 24 December 2017 on the RTS1 channel, as well as on many other television channels in the former Yugoslav countries. 
The filming of the first season took place between October 2016 and June 2017. The second was filmed during 2018, with all ten episodes airing on 8 November 2019. The first season was received very well by audience and critics alike, some controversy notwithstanding. The production, acting, editing and costume design have all received praise, as have the themes the series deals with. Since March 2020, the series has been available internationally on the Amazon Prime streaming service.
Premise.
The series is divided into three seasons and encompasses the period between 1928 and 1940. The first season covers the period just before the assassination of the Croatian Member of the National Assembly Stjepan Radić at the National Assembly of the Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians and the subsequent establishment of the dictatorship.
The main setting for the series is Belgrade in between the two world wars. Lead characters are fifty-year-old police inspector Andra Tanasijević “Tane“ and his new associate, a young forensic by the name of Stanko Pletikosić. Belgrade is portrayed as a place where crime consists of classic robberies and murders, but whose biggest problems are wars between opium cartels, which use the city as a route for smuggling the drug further into Europe and the United States. The plot of the first season starts with a peculiar and brutal murder occurring at a costume ball at which most of the Belgrade social elite is gathered. Inspector Tanasijević soon discovers that the cause of the eerie events, which multiply by the day, is an ancient relic: namely, the Holy Lance Jesus was pierced with on the cross, which seems to possess mystical power. The Inspector discovers there are people ready to do anything to acquire the Lance, and is sucked into a tangled web of crime involving a range of interest groups: the Russian White army under General Vrangel, the Soviet Union Secret Police (OGPU and NKVD), the Serbian Black Hand movement, IMRO, the Yugoslav communists, elements of the Belgrade underbelly and, not least, a secret society going under the name of Thule. Hot on the crime trail, the Inspector looks for the relic with one aim in mind: to transport it out of Belgrade and thereby prevent further deaths.
The series is set to run over three seasons. The first season consists of ten episodes and is set in the run-up to the 6 January dictatorship. The second season also has ten episodes, and deals with the period before the assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseilles. The third season is due to be set just before start of World War II in Yugoslavia.
Screenings.
Pre-premiere in Serbia was on 17 October 2017 at Yugoslav Film Archive. The series had a premiere in Serbia on RTS on 12 October 2017 and had a time slot at 8 pm, which has long been the default time slot for all Serbian and Yugoslav TV series. The first episode in Serbia was watched by more than 2.123.000 viewers and was the most watched media on that channel. The premiere in Bosnia and Herzegovina was at the 23rd Sarajevo Film Festival, where two episodes which received ovations were shown. The first season was airing on RTRS. In Montenegro the series is aired on RTCG 1, and in Macedonia on MRT 1. The series debuted in Macedonia at the 38. Manaki Brothers Film Festival in Bitola on 25 September 2017, and Dragan Bjelogrlić, Tomi Salkovski (co-producer), Igor Ivanov Izi (director on one of the episodes) as well as the actors Marija Bergam, Jana Stojanovska, Pero Arsovski and Petar Atanovski addressed the audience. 
There was a great controversy in Croatian media for not airing the first season, and the reasons cited were that it was due to the character of Ante Pavelić and also that Dragan Bjelogrlić himself forbade it. Bjelogrlić dismissed these claims and said that the main reason for the series not airing in Croatia was because no channel acquired the rights to air.
Bjelogrlić gave 2019 as the year in which the second season will be airing. The name of the series was translated into English as "Black Sun" in reference to the eponymous symbol frequently seen in the series, as well as the more literal "Balkan Shadows".
Production and inspiration.
Dragan Bjelogrlić first got interested in the time period in which the series is set while filming the TV series as well as the movie version of Montevideo, God Bless You! He got interested in this period because he knew very little of it and he also thought that the Serbian public in general isn't well informed about it: "Our destiny was such that we never learned much about that time period, it was almost never talked about. And those were important and in a way intense times, especially in Yugoslavia." The fact that Yugoslavia was called "Colombia of Europe" between the two Wars also served as an inspiration to him.
In his article for Blic he wrote that he didn't want to compromise on any part of the show's creation: "Shadows over Balkan is a piece for which I tried to make no compromises. There were no compromises on any level and in any phase of the show's production. From the screenplay, story, themes, national divisions, aesthetics, direction to the budget and cost. I didn't want to concern myself with the acquired taste of the RTS audience, ratings, political correctness, puritan moral principles, conservative historians, "first" and "second Serbia", and the like…" He seriously doubted in the success of the show, because "in aesthetic, dramaturgic and narrative aspects it was different than everything else he worked on in the past." He was inspired by a number of American, German, Italian, Scandinavian and Eastern European TV series, and as the main source of inspiration he cited Boardwalk Empire. He was also inspired by the connection between crime and corruption saying how "when he put some things in order, he came to the conclusion that there exists a historic constant which affects this region, because it is of utmost importance that when you are working on a piece of art which deals with the past, it is important to focus on the moment from which you are doing it."
The filming of the first season took place between 1 October 2016 and end of July 2017. The series was shot on many different locations in Belgrade, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a new film studio was also built in Baranda. Poor part of Belgrade from that period was constructed here -Jatagan Mala with fictive kafanas named "Kod Nišliju" ("At Niški's") and "Savsko bure" ("Sava barrel"), Pištoljmala and Savamala), as well as the richer part with a marketplace, a candy shop and a quilt shop, as well as a barber shop. According to Bjelogrlić, 30% of the filming took place in Baranda. Some particular scenes were shot on Zrenjanin streets as well as in its City Hall. Some scenes were supposed to be filmed in Slovenia as well, RTV Slovenija was in support of this, but it was later abandoned due to financial reasons.
Together with Bjelogrlić, the screenplay was worked on by screenwriters Danica Pajović, Dejan Stojiljković and Vladimir Kecmanović adapted to a film story by Stevan Koprivica. Koprivica worked on some of the early episodes, and according to Danica Pajović, "the story was a Conan-Doyle type mystical drama about two inspectors who are working on resolving a series of sacrificial murders in Belgrade set between the two Wars. Bjelogrlić then expanded the theme to the Belgrade underbelly and opium trade in Yugoslavia and convoluted the story to such an extent that Dejan Stojiljković and I had to join the screenwriters team, with Vladimir Kecmanović also joining us later." According to his own words, this was the first time Dejan Stojiljković wrote a screenplay for a movie or a TV series.
Robert Pešut "Magnifico", with whom Bjelogrlić already collaborated on "Montevideo ", worked on the soundtrack for the series. Ognjen "Ogi" Radivojević sang the song in the title sequence, and he was chosen by Magnifico and Bjelogrlić "because of his specific tone of voice and emotions which emerge from his vocal range." Other notable musicians took part in series, such as Nikola Pejaković, Ksenija Kuljača etc.

Saissetia coffeae

Saissetia coffeae, known generally as hemispherical scale, is a species of soft scale insect in the family Coccidae. Other common names include the helmet scale and coffee brown scale.
Description.
The adult scale varies in diameter from about to , largely depending on the identity of the host plant. It is smooth, shiny and brown and closely adpressed to a stem or leaf, resembling a miniature military helmet. Young scales often have a slightly ridged surface, sometimes in the form of a "H". Like other scale insects, the hemispherical scale has no limbs and is immobile, piercing the plant tissues with its mouthparts and feeding on sap.
Distribution.
"Saissetia coffeae" is present in West, Central and East Africa, Madagascar, tropical and subtropical Asia, North, Central and South America and the Caribbean region.
Life cycle.
All hemispherical scale insects are female, and breeding occurs by parthenogenesis. The eggs are pinkish-beige, oblong and about long. Up to a thousand eggs are laid, and they remain concealed under the scale husk, the parent dying soon after they are laid. The eggs hatch into first instars known as "crawlers", the only mobile phase in this species, which leave the shelter of the mother's scale to disperse. They have short antennae and limbs, a pair of red eyespots, and a pair of long setae (bristles) at the back. When they have reached a suitable spot, they plunge their mouthparts into the plant, shed their skin and develop into second instar nymphs. There is a further instar stage before the adult stage is reached, the whole development period taking forty days or more. There may be several generations each year.
Ecology.
The hemispherical scale attacks many different plants including crops such as coffee, tea, sugar apple and pumpkin, greenhouse plants and ornamental shrubs, being found on the stems, leaves and fruits. It produces copious amounts of honeydew which encourages the growth of sooty mould, and also causes leaf fall and the stunting of shoots on the host plant. It may be attended by ants which feed on the honeydew and protect the scales from their natural enemies. It is attacked by parasitoids, such as those that have been introduced in various parts of the world to control "Saissetia oleae", a serious pest of olive trees.

Pseudaulacaspis pentagona

Pseudaulacaspis pentagona, the white peach scale or mulberry scale, is a species of armoured scale insect in the family Diaspididae. This scale infests over 100 different genera of plants including many fruit trees and ornamentals.
Description.
The adult female insect is up to in length. The soft yellow body is concealed under a roughly circular, whitish test with a yellowish-brown off-centre spot (this is the exuviae or shed skins of the last two nymphal moults). Males are concealed under whitish, felted, elongated oval tests with yellowish spots at one end; sometimes many males will accumulate in one area, covering the bark and looking like snow. Mature males have no mouthparts but have wings and seek out females, while mature females do not have wings and remain permanently in one place.
Distribution.
"Pseudaulacaspis pentagona" is native to eastern Asia but has been accidentally introduced into many other warm and temperate parts of the world. In Europe, it was first detected in Italy in the nineteenth century and is now additionally found in Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia, Malta, Montenegro, Netherlands, Portugal, Russia, Serbia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine. In the twenty-first century it has been spreading northwards, perhaps because of climate change, but is restricted to greenhouses in cooler climates such as Sweden.
Hosts.
"Pseudaulacaspis pentagona" is polyphagous, meaning that it has many plant hosts. It is particularly a pest of fruit trees such as peach, plum, apricot, cherry, currant, grape, pawpaw, fig, mulberry, apple, pear, kiwi fruit and walnut. It also infests various ornamental plants, including "Sophora", "Sorbus", "Syringa", "Catalpa", "Euonymus", "Philadelphus" and "Paulownia".
Life cycle.
Mature females lay 100 to 150 eggs, the number largely depending on the food plant. The eggs hatch after three or four days; those destined to be males are orange while female eggs are white. The newly hatched first instar nymphs are mobile and disperse to other parts of the plant. Males have five instars while females have three; the later instars are immobile, sinking their mouthparts into the plant tissues to extract sap. There may be up to four generations each year. In the United States, a generation is completed in about 38 days in summer and about 85 days in winter. In cold climates, adult females survive the winter even when the temperature falls as low as . Dispersal to new locations may occur when nymphs are blown away or adhere to birds or flying insects; and also occurs with the transport of nursery stock.

Gainsborough Studios (Manhattan)

The Gainsborough Studios, also known as 222 Central Park South, is a residential building on Central Park South, just east of Columbus Circle, in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. Designed by Charles W. Buckham, the building is 16 stories tall with 34 apartments. Named after English painter Thomas Gainsborough, the building is one of several in Manhattan that were built in the early 20th century as both studios and residences for artists.
The Gainsborough Studios' name and design indicated its artistic connotations. The facade contains a bust of Gainsborough above the main entrance; a bas-relief across the third floor, designed by Isidore Konti; and tile murals by Henry Chapman Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works at the top stories. Some studios have ceilings with double-height spaces, while others are smaller units that occupy part of a single floor. Artists generally rented the studios as a combination residence and working space.
The Gainsborough Studios corporation built the structure between 1907 and 1908 as artists' cooperative housing, although it gradually became a standard residential development. The lobby was restored in the 1950s and in 1981, and a full renovation of the building commenced in 1988. The building was designated a city landmark by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission in 1988.
Site.
The Gainsborough Studios is in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City, just east of Columbus Circle. It is on the southern side of Central Park South between Seventh Avenue and Broadway, across from Central Park to the north. The Gainsborough Studios occupies a lot measuring on Central Park South and deep. Nearby buildings include 200 and 220 Central Park South to the east, 240 Central Park South to the west, and 1790 Broadway and the Central Park Tower to the south.
Design.
The Gainsborough Studios is tall and has 16 stories. Charles W. Buckham was the architect, while Wells Bros. Company was the general contractor. The artist was the founding president of the Gainsborough Studios corporation, which developed the building. Franzen was a significant figure in the building's planning, and may have influenced the decision to name the building after English painter Thomas Gainsborough. The Gainsborough Studios' exterior design reflects both its interior furnishings and its purpose as an artists' studio, with numerous allusions to art in both its name and facade. It is one of a few artists' housing cooperatives remaining in Manhattan.
Facade.
The first and second floors are faced with limestone. The entrance is set within a square doorway under a portico with the words , which in turn is supported by a pair of white terracotta and granite Ionic columns. There is a double-height window to each side of the main entrance, with two stone mullions and a thick stone muntin in each window. A staircase to the basement is west of the entrance. Running across the third story is a bas-relief frieze by Isidore Konti called "Procession of the Arts". The frieze depicts various people delivering gifts to an altar representing the arts, and contains two small windows. A plinth sits atop the entrance portico, supporting a bust of Thomas Gainsborough outside the fourth and fifth stories.
Above the second story, the building's facade is split into two vertical bays, flanked by three brick piers with stone reveals. The facade generally contains double-height windows facing Central Park South, which break up the facade into several double-story sections between the second and fifteenth floors. The lower portion of each double-story section features a quatrefoil panel and a small pediment at the center, flanked by a glass pane on each side. The upper portion of each double-story section, as well as the fourth floor, contains a large window divided into several sections by narrow mullions. The lower and upper portions of each double-height story are separated by narrow spandrel panels. An arch runs above each bay over the twelfth story.
Above the twelfth story, the piers are ornamented with tile mosaics by Henry Chapman Mercer's Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. The mosaics contain geometric patterns in red, yellow, green, and gray hues; the central pier contains more elaborate decoration compared to the outer piers. Atop the building is a corbel table with shell designs, as well as acroteria atop each pier.
Features.
The Gainsborough Studios contains 34 units, which were marketed to artists as a studio that could be used as living space. The building has a shared kitchen, laundry, and dining room, although individual units contain reception areas for clients. When completed, the building contained 14 duplex apartments and 25 single-floor apartments, for a total of 39 units.
The Gainsborough Studios was legally classified as a hotel to circumvent zoning restrictions that prevented new apartment buildings from being taller than 150 percent of the width of the adjacent street. As a result, there was a communal kitchen area at ground level, while individual apartments lacked full kitchens. There are two elevators and an emergency stair, flanking enclosure at the center of the building. As designed, the elevator at the northern end of the hall was the main passenger elevator, and the elevator at the southern end was used for freight.
Only the northern facade had natural light overlooking Central Park. Accordingly, the units on the building's northern side were equipped with ceilings and double-height windows, and thus contained the duplex suites. The other apartments were single-story units. On each floor pairing, there was two double-height duplex units on the north side and four single-story units on the south side, arranged around a central hallway with a fire staircase and two elevators. The duplex units contain a mezzanine overlooking the double-height studios along Central Park South. The second and third floors are irregular, in that the front sections of these floors contain duplex apartments, while the rear had restaurant space.
History.
Cooperative apartment housing in New York City became popular in the late 19th century because of overcrowded housing conditions in the city's dense urban areas. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were some co-ops in the city that catered specifically to artists, including at 130 and 140 West 57th Street, as well as on 67th Street near Central Park. However, these were almost always fully occupied. Some of the artists' co-ops contained features such as double-height ceilings, while others like Gainsborough Studios contained large working areas illuminated by light from the north.
In 1907, businessman Barron Collier and artists Colin Campbell Cooper, Elliott Daingerfield, and August Franzen formed the Gainsborough Studios corporation, headquartered at 307 Fifth Avenue. The corporation would plan and develop an artists' cooperative apartment on Central Park South. The corporation bought tenements at 222 and 224 Central Park South in April 1907. Buckham was hired as architect, and that May, he filed plans with the New York City Department of Buildings for an eight-story fireproof artists' studio on the site, to cost $300,000. Wells Bros. Company was awarded the general construction contract in August 1907. Work started on November 3, 1907, after the existing building had been demolished. The new building officially opened on October 31, 1908.
At various points in the building's history, residents included artist Montague Flagg, sculptor William Ordway Partridge, and travel writer Thomas Allibone Janvier, as well as artist Enrico Donati. One resident of the Gainsborough Studios in the 1910s, John Hemming Fry, became a vice president of the Gainsborough Studios corporation and subsequently developed the nearby Rodin Studios using his experience from the Gainsborough Studios. During the 1950s, another resident, Donald Deskey, led a renovation of the building's lobby. As part of the project, the ornate iron doors from the original design were replaced with aluminum doors. 
In 1981, the Gainsborough Studios Corporation spent $100,000 on renovating the lobby to its original condition, using historical photographs to create replicas of the original doors. The terracotta and tile facade degraded over time, and starting in 1988, the building was renovated for $1 million. The colored ceramic tiles were reproduced by hand, the terracotta was partially replaced, and the frieze was recast in concrete. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission also made the building an official city landmark in 1988, after the renovation had commenced. By 2004, the Gainsborough Studios had almost entirely become a standard residential suite, and Donati was the last artist remaining in the building. In the early 21st century, philanthropist Blaine Trump moved into the building as well.
Critical reception.
Upon its completion, the Gainsborough Studios' design was described as "a credit to the ingenuity of the designer". In 1977, architectural writer Paul Goldberger wrote for "The New York Times" that the facade of the Gainsborough Studios was "far more interesting than anything on 67th Street", praising the Ionic columns at the base and the mosaics at the top. Christopher Gray wrote for the same paper in 2013 that the building "constitute[d] the first recognition I have seen that the vista north to 110th Street was beginning to be considered special", reflecting on the development boom along Central Park South when the building was completed.

<doc id="56645263" url="?curid=56645263" title="Hemiberlesia lataniae">
Hemiberlesia lataniae

Hemiberlesia lataniae, the latania or palm scale, is a species of armored scale insect in the family Diaspididae. It was first described by the French entomologist Victor Antoine Signoret in 1869 using "Latania lontaroides", a species of palm tree endemic to Réunion as its host; since then, it has been found on avocado trees growing in South Africa, Australia, Israel, the United States, and on a range of other plants in many parts of the world.
Description.
Scale insects have a domed, waxy covering which protects the soft-bodied insect below. Armored scales retain the exuviae (shed cuticles) from the first one or two nymphal stages, and sometimes faecal matter and fragments of the host plant, incorporating these into a hard, protective cover. The adult female palm scale has no wings or legs and is somewhat variable in appearance depending on where it is living; if feeding on leaves, the scale cover is circular and convex, and its colour tends to be greyish-white, while on twigs, branches and fruits, the cover is usually brownish and only moderately convex. The exuviae are yellowish-brown and are a noticeable feature near the centre of the scale. Male scale covers are oval, and adult males are small insects with legs and a single pair of wings. They have no mouthparts and only live for a day or two.
Distribution and hosts.
The palm scale has a wide range of host plants and has a nearly cosmopolitan distribution, having spread around the world, mostly on ornamental plants. It is known to use members of at least 78 different plant families as hosts, particularly favouring Rosaceae, Arecaceae and Euphorbiaceae. It is a major pest of kiwifruit, citrus, coconut, "Melia azedarach" (chinaberry), avocado, guava and grape.
Biology.
In some parts of the world, only female insects are present, and they breed by parthenogenesis. The female scales insert their mouthparts into the host plant's vascular tissues and suck the sap. They have no legs and do not move about as adults. The yellow eggs are retained by the female under her scale and hatch after a few hours. The newly emerged nymphs crawl away and disperse, losing their legs at their first moult after about two weeks. The second nymphal stage lasts another two or three weeks before moulting to the adult stage.
The organism may have a mutualistic relationship with a fungus, Septobasidium, which can protect them from predators such as aphelinid wasps and lady beetles like Aphytis diaspidis and Chilocorus stigma, and overgrow the colony completely obscuring them from view entirely, but this may stunt the growth of scale insects infected by the fungus as a side effect.

In the 1940s the species, originating in Asia, infested nearly 69 species fodder and turf grasses in Texas causing major economic loss. Classical biological control was made use of in the 1950s and 60s with nearly complete control achieved after the aerial introduction of a wingless encyrtid parasite from India, "Neodusmetia sangwani". By 1976 the control was a complete success and nearly 17 million USD was estimated as savings due to the parasite.

Aspidiotus destructor

Aspidiotus destructor, the coconut scale, is a species of armoured scale insect in the family Diaspididae, found in many tropical and subtropical parts of the world. It is a serious pest of coconut and banana, and attacks a range of other fruiting trees and ornamental plants.
Description.
All but the first instar nymphs live under the protection of a waxy test or scale and remain in one place. First instar nymphs have legs and move about looking for somewhere to settle. Second instar and adult females have rounded, flattish tests up to in diameter. They have no eyes or appendages, and their soft yellow bodies are visible through the translucent test, giving them the appearance of miniature fried eggs. Males have smaller, more elongated tests, and pass through a pseudo-pupal stage before metamorphosing into reddish, gnat-like insects with eyes, antennae, legs and wings, but no mouthparts. 
Distribution.
"Aspidiotus destructor" has a global distribution in tropical and subtropical regions. It is believed to have originated in South Asia but has spread to other parts of Asia, Australia, Africa, Brazil, Central America, the Caribbean region and North America. Its accidental introduction to various Pacific Islands where it lacked natural enemies caused much crop loss.
Hosts.
"Aspidiotus destructor" is a major pest of coconut, but also feeds on various fruit trees and ornamental plants; these include banana, apple, avocado, breadfruit, citrus, grape, guava, mango, ficus, camellia, papaya, ginger, bird of paradise, sugarcane, plumeria and oil palms. On coconut it infests the under surface of the leaves, the leaf stalks, flowers and small fruit, causing discolouration, chlorosis and distortion.
Life cycle.
Mature females lay a batch of up to about 65 eggs over a ten-day period, retaining them under the test. When first hatched, the nymphs are known as "crawlers" and move to other parts of the plant before settling. Having moulted, they start sucking sap from the host plant; females will remain static for the rest of their lives, but males will become mobile after their final moult. Mature females release a pheromone to attract males. A female will lay several batches of eggs before dying, but adult males do not feed and soon die.
Biological control.
"Aspidiotus destructor" was causing severe damage to both coconuts and bananas on Guam in the early 1900s. Several parasites and predators were introduced in an attempt to control the scale without much success, until the coconut scale predator ("Cryptognatha nodiceps") was introduced from Trinidad and successfully controlled the pest within nine months. This lady beetle was successful where the other predators had failed because of its voracious appetite, its fecundity, and its ability to seek out and feed on other prey species when the scale population diminished. It was equally successful in Príncipe in West Africa in the 1950s, but other species of lady beetle have been more effective in Mauritius and the New Hebrides.

Hostages (1992 film)

Hostages is a 1992 American drama film directed by David Wheatley and written by Bernard MacLaverty. The film stars Kathy Bates, Colin Firth, Ciarán Hinds, Natasha Richardson, Jay O. Sanders, Josef Sommer and Harry Dean Stanton. The film premiered in the United Kingdom on ITV on September 23, 1992, and in the United States on HBO on February 20, 1993.
Plot.
This film is a dramatization of the Beirut hostage crisis. After several real-life news clips highlight the situation in Beirut, including footage of bombings and attacks in the Lebanese capital along with the hijacking of TWA flight 847, the film opens with reporter John McCarthy finishing a story on Brian Keenan, an Irish lecturer who was kidnapped in Beirut days earlier. The following day, en route to Beirut Airport, McCarthy's car is surrounded and when identified as a British national, he is thrown back into the car which is commandeered by the kidnappers. He is brought to an apartment before being handed off to a group of men, who strip, blindfold and lock him in a closet.
At home, his girlfriend, journalist Jill Morrell, seeks guidance from her local officials, who advise there will be no negotiations to secure his release, as officials feel conceding to the terrorists will only encourage more abductions. Two sisters of Brian Keenan are similarly seeking help from their local government in Belfast with similar response and inaction. McCarthy is later moved to another building, into the same room as Brian Keenan. The two develop a friendship as they, like the other hostages, were forced to endure unbearable conditions, including beatings at the hands of their captors, poor food, lack of sunlight, and dirty, bug-infested cells.
Some time later, as Syria invades Beirut, McCarthy and Keenan are mummy-wrapped in duct tape and moved in the underside of a pick up truck to another location where American hostages Terry Anderson, Thomas Sutherland and Frank Reed are being held. The five hostages remain together, chained to the walls and must remain blindfolded whenever their captors enter their cell. Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, is working with American officials to seek information on her brother and the other hostages. She, Morrell and the Keenan sisters seek opportunities to publicize the plight of the hostages in local news to bring more attention to the dire situation.
Following the mistaken shoot down of an Iranian airliner, the hostages are duct taped and moved back to Beirut. McCarthy, Keenan and Reed are confined in one cell together, while Anderson and Sutherland are in another. Reed is released after some time, and later Keenan is released. At first, Keenan thinks his release is a trick, as he had been told nearly a dozen times prior that his release was imminent and was cancelled at the last minute. McCarthy is then moved to the cell where Anderson and Sutherland are being held. They are soon allowed visits from another hostage, Terry Waite, who up until that time, spent several years in captivity in complete isolation. He begins visiting them on a regular basis and during one such visit, McCarthy is tapped on the shoulder and taken to another room where he is told he will be released. His captors also state the release of the other hostages is imminent.
Jill is phoned with the news of John's release, and Keenan is told by a relative of McCarthy's release after hearing on the local news. McCarthy arrives in the United Kingdom with Jill and Keenan at the airport. The film concludes with the release of Anderson, Reed, Sutherland and Waite with a narrative being spoken over the final scenes by Keenan.

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is a historical fiction novel by American author Taylor Jenkins Reid and published by Atria Books in 2017. The novel tells the story of the fictional Old Hollywood star Evelyn Hugo, who at the age of 79 decides to give a final interview to an unknown journalist, Monique Grant. According to Reid, Evelyn Hugo was loosely based in part on actresses Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times to seven different men, and Ava Gardner, who revealed the secrets of her life to a journalist which was eventually published as "". Reid also discusses how Rita Hayworth was a big influence on the character Evelyn Hugo. Hayworth, whose father was a Spaniard, had a very similar start to Hugo which can be seen in the beginning of the novel.
The novel was nominated for a Goodreads Choice Award for Best Historical Fiction of 2017.
 In 2019, Freeform and Fox 21 Television Studios picked up the rights for development. Jennifer Beals and Ilene Chaiken, who worked on "The L Word", will be producing the show. Reid will work on the show as a screenwriter.
Plot.
Monique Grant, a reporter for Vivant magazine, has been individually selected to interview Evelyn Hugo, a reclusive former star, who is auctioning some of her famous gowns to raise money for a breast cancer charity. Monique is confused as to why Evelyn has chosen her, but goes to Evelyn's apartment to meet her. Evelyn reveals she has no interest in giving an interview for Vivant but instead wants Monique to write her life story, and Monique agrees, though she is suspicious.
Evelyn is 14 when she marries her first husband, Ernie Diaz, in order to reach Hollywood and escape her abusive father in Hell's Kitchen. She is noticed by Harry Cameron, a young Sunset Studios producer, and the two become close friends. Evelyn seduces a Sunset executive in order to advance her career, and divorces Ernie Diaz when the studio sets her up with popular actors for publicity. She falls in love with and marries actor Don Adler, but in the following months, Don begins to abuse Evelyn when pressure is placed on his career.
In an adaptation of Little Women, Evelyn, now 21, stars opposite Celia St. James. Evelyn is initially jealous of Celia's talent, but the two quickly form a bond. At a party, Evelyn is told that Celia is a lesbian. Evelyn privately confronts Celia to ask if this is true, and the two kiss. Evelyn discovers that Don has been cheating on her, but he divorces her first and sabotages her career. To revive her popularity, Evelyn goes to Paris and stars in a racy film by French director Max Girard. Rumors have begun to spread about Evelyn and Celia's relationship, so Evelyn creates a plan to distract the press. She seduces and elopes with singer Mick Riva, then has the marriage annulled the next day. The plan works, but Evelyn is pregnant. She gets an abortion, but Celia is furious and leaves her. They do not speak for five years.
After starring in an adaptation of Anna Karenina, Evelyn marries her co-star, Rex North, in order to generate publicity. They stay married for a few years, but after Rex impregnates his girlfriend, Evelyn spins a story that she and Harry Cameron were having an affair. In reality, Harry is secretly dating quarterback John Braverman, who is married to Celia. Evelyn and Celia reunite. Evelyn marries Harry, and they live closely with Celia and John, posing as two heterosexual couples. After several idyllic years, Harry suggests that he and Evelyn have a child, and Evelyn agrees. With Celia's blessing, they have a daughter named Connor.
In her late 30s, Evelyn stars in another Max Girard movie, in which she agrees to an explicit sex scene. Evelyn realizes afterwards that she should have asked Celia's permission. Celia leaves Evelyn again. John Braverman dies of a heart attack, and Harry begins drinking excessively. Evelyn agrees to marry Max Girard, but quickly discovers that he does not truly love her. She stays married to him for six years before reuniting with Celia. Celia tells Evelyn that she has emphysema and less than ten years to live. Evelyn asks Harry to move with them to Europe, and Harry wants to bring the man he has been seeing. Before a plan can move forward, Evelyn finds Harry and a dead passenger in a car accident outside his house. Evelyn moves the passenger, Harry's lover, into the driver's seat to protect Harry from being convicted of drunk driving. Harry dies in the hospital.
Evelyn, Celia, and Connor move to Spain, along with Celia's brother Robert, who Evelyn marries as a front. Celia dies when she is 61, and Robert several years after that. Evelyn explains to Monique that Connor died of breast cancer, which Evelyn has also been diagnosed with. Evelyn reveals that Monique's father, James Grant, was the passenger in Harry's car. By removing Harry from the scene, Evelyn allowed Monique and her mother to believe that James had died driving drunk. Monique is furious and leaves, but realizes that Evelyn has told her all of this because she intends to end her life. She considers calling authorities, but decides that it should be Evelyn's choice if she wants to die. She realizes that she will forgive Evelyn one day. Evelyn's death is reported as an accidental overdose, and Monique publishes the introduction for her biography in Vivant, finally disclosing that the true love of Evelyn's life was not one of her seven husbands.

Embassy of the Philippines, Moscow

The Embassy of the Philippines in Moscow is the diplomatic mission of the Republic of the Philippines to the Russian Federation. Occupied since 1978, it is located on 6/8 Karmanitskiy Lane () in the Arbat District of central Moscow, a short walk from the headquarters of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and near the former home of Alexander Pushkin and the residence of the Ambassador of the United States to Russia.
History.
The Philippines did not immediately open a resident embassy when diplomatic relations between the Philippines and the then-Soviet Union were established in 1976. Its first diplomatic mission in Moscow was opened on August 2, 1977, when Juan A. Ona, appointed to serve as the first minister-counsellor to the Soviet Union, operating from Room 786 of the Hotel Ukraina (today the Radisson Royal Hotel, Moscow). The Embassy continues to maintain its linkages to the hotel, as it billets its guests there.
Ona was later joined by two officers to help run the post, becoming the mission's erstwhile "chargé d'affaires", and on September 30, 1977, Luis Moreno Salcedo arrived in Moscow as the first resident Philippine ambassador to the Soviet Union.
In late 1978, Soviet authorities permitted the Philippine embassy to relocate to its current premises, an L-shaped Khrushchev-era building that previously served as the embassy of South Vietnam. Today, the building houses both the mission's chancery and ambassador's residence.
Upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Philippine Embassy in Moscow subsequently was accredited to Russia and eleven former Soviet republics, with jurisdiction over Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania being transferred to the Philippine Embassy in Stockholm, and jurisdiction over Moldova being transferred to the Philippine Embassy in Bucharest. Currently the embassy has jurisdiction over Russia, Armenia, and Belarus, with the other former Soviet republics under its jurisdiction being transferred to other missions.

Madeline's Madeline

Madeline's Madeline is a 2018 American drama film written and directed by Josephine Decker. It stars Helena Howard in the titular role, alongside Molly Parker as her teacher and Miranda July as her mother. Howard plays a teenage actor, Madeline, who is encouraged by her theater director Evangeline (Parker) to blur the lines between the character she is playing and her actual identity. The film is known for its experimental visuals and the improvisational process Decker used to create the story, not unlike the characters themselves.
The film had its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival on January 22, 2018. It was released on August 10, 2018, by Oscilloscope Laboratories. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for Howard's performance, which was hailed by IndieWire as one of the 50 best performances of the 2010s decade.
Plot.
Madeline is a lonely teenager who is part of a professional acting ensemble creating an experimental theater performance about "The Three Little Pigs" using improvisation. She enjoys the company of the other actors and their director Evangeline, and dreads having to go home to her mother Regina who doesn't understand Madeline and often starts arguments. One day at rehearsal, Madeline confesses to Evangeline that she had a dream in which she placed a hot iron on her mother. Struck by this dream, Evangeline decides to have the performers recreate it in an improv exercise. Madeline gets overwhelmed at how her life is conflating with her art and wanders out of the theater alone while Regina looks for her. After she finds Madeline, Regina discovers that Madeline's prescription for an unspecified mental illness has run out, and she struggles to get it quickly refilled.
Evangeline gradually makes Madeline's life the central focus of the theater performance they are devising. During a promotional photoshoot, Evangeline asks Regina to pose in the photo with Madeline. One rehearsal ends early, so Madeline goes to Evangeline's house for a birthday party, where she shows off her acting skills to the uncomfortable guests and hits on Evangeline's husband. After speaking with Evangeline about their mutual feelings of self-consciousness and vulnerability, Madeline reveals that she wants to leave the group and Evangeline agrees that Madeline should take a break from acting for a bit.
Madeline is relieved at her new found creative freedom but is dismayed when Evangeline stops by Madeline's house. She and Regina end up bonding over a couple glasses of wine, and Evangeline convinces Regina that she would be an excellent actor if she tried it. She tells Regina to stop by rehearsal the next day. All three women show up to the rehearsal, and Evangeline has them do an exercise where everyone pretends to be Regina, but Madeline's version of her mother is too real and it hits a nerve: Regina leaves the rehearsal crying.
Evangeline loves how real the emotions are, and asks the performers to recreate that scene again while she takes an important phone call outside. The performers are disgusted by the way Evangeline has been exploiting Madeline's emotions and identity, and they lock the door. They quickly devise a performance for Evangeline: a confrontational journey through the winding rehearsal building.
At first Evangeline objects to being shoved around by everyone, but eventually despite struggling, she is used as part of the performance. The troupe ends up outside in the street, all dancing together in the sunlight as Madeline walks in the opposite direction.
Production.
Josephine Decker directed the film and wrote its screenplay. Camera work was handled by Ashley Connor, and music was composed by Caroline Shaw. The film's producers were Krista Parris and Elizabeth Rao.
Decker and Howard first met in 2014 at a teen arts festival that the director was judging. 15-year-old Howard performed a monologue from "Blackbird" by David Harrower, and Decker was so moved by the performance that she began to cry, which caused Howard to cry, too. Decker told her that it was the best performance she'd ever seen, and that she'd like them to work together on a film.
The film's story began as a fictionalized telling of Howard's own life, but Decker also wanted to explore her own anxieties as an artist. In her previous work "Bi the Way" and "Flames", she had experiences where artists told others' stories in ways that she felt were exploitative, and she wanted to explore whether it would be possible to tell someone else's story faithfully.
In 2014, she began a series of workshops to devise the story, based on techniques she had learned at the Pig Iron Theatre Company in Philadelphia and the School of Making Thinking. Decker, Howard, and eleven other actors met about nine different times over the course of seven months. They used improvisation to create a variety of different scenes, many of which never ended up in the final film, and explored each performer's personal experiences, such as with mental illness. Cinematographer Ashley Connor also participated in some of the workshops because Decker wanted the camera to also be treated as a character. After all the workshops, Decker sat down and wrote a script that incorporated the best scenes they had created. In one draft of the script, she included a real-life event that had happened between her and Howard, and when she realized that it had crossed a line between the character Madeline and the actual Helena Howard, she decided to take the script in a more fictional direction. Decker realized from that experience that the character Evangeline would have enjoyed crossing boundaries like that, so she started incorporating that desire into her character.
Decker continued this collaborative style during production. At the beginning of each day of shooting, the cast and crew met for a short meditation and a chance for anyone to voice concerns they had with the production process. Many of the scenes were improvised, so Connor and gaffer David April lit the sets in such a way that the actors and camera could freely move anywhere without a light being in the shot. The visual style of the film incorporated camera techniques that Connor and Decker had discovered working on previous films together. Connor created a custom camera rig that allowed her to manipulate the focus in new ways, which Chris O'Falt of Indiewire described as "an almost liquid-like aspect to the focus, and the image if often slightly doubled or warped, while out-of-focus translucent objects come into the edges of frame to cause pockets of soft, sometimes colorful blurring."
Harrison Atkins was the editor for the first four months of post production and made over a hundred different cuts of the movie exploring various ways the story could be told, but when he had to leave to work on a different show, Decker took on the editing herself. Six months went by and she still wasn't satisfied with the film, so she brought on producer Liz Rao to help with editing for five weeks. With only two weeks left until the deadline for submitting to the Sundance Film Festival, Decker realized there was still a major problem with the ending, so she brought on David Barker for some last-minute changes. Spike Jonze and Mike Mills also offered advice during post-production.
Release.
"Madeline's Madeline" was first screened at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, and the Berlin Film Festivals in February. Oscilloscope Laboratories acquired U.S. distribution rights and announced plans for a general release later in the year. The film initially was shown at only one theater in Manhattan, and was eventually expanded to 31 theaters.
Reception.
Critical response.
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 88% based on 115 reviews, with an average rating of 7.67/10. The website's critics consensus reads, ""Madeline's Madeline" proves experimental cinema is alive and well – and serves as a powerful calling card for Helena Howard in her big-screen debut." Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".
Writing in "The Village Voice", Bilge Ebiri called "Madeline's Madeline" "the best thing I saw at Sundance this year". IndieWire reviewer David Ehrlich described the film as "one of the boldest and most invigorating American films of the 21st century". The "New York Times" called it a "seductive, disturbing, exasperating movie," noting it blurs the line between "fantasy and reality, certainly, but also between authenticity and artifice, theater and therapy, art and life."
The film was well-received by "Entertainment Weekly," which praised the "nuanced" portrayal of the protagonist and her growth as a "self-possessed" character dealing with dominating authority figures. WBUR in Boston named it one of the best films of 2018, describing the plot as "three women perform an intricate psychological dance, with two locked in a vicious tug-of-war for a third's affections." The "Boston Globe" gave it 4/5 stars and called it "stunning." It received a mixed review from "Variety," with the review praising how it addressed multiple issues such as identity and a "form of penance by its director, Josephine Decker, for appropriating the lives of her collaborators." However, it "mistakes intimacy for honesty, and it mis-assumes that audiences care nearly as much about the creative process as actors and directors do."
In 2019, Howard's performance was hailed by IndieWire as one of the 50 best performances of the 2010s decade.

The ship was launched on 18 March 1903 and after sea trials was commissioned in April of the same year. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Clan Macalister" was assessed at 4,835 GRT and . The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 450 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Operational history.
In early 1900s, the Clan Line operated two main routes between United Kingdom and her colonies in the East. The first one was a direct route from the home ports through the Strait of Gibraltar, Suez Canal and to the ports of India and Ceylon. The second one involved sailing down the western coast of Africa first to the ports of South African colonies, then onto the ports of Ceylon and India, and occasional trips to Australia.
"Clan Macalister" departed for her maiden voyage from Barrow on 3 May 1903 for South Africa.

Elacatinus colini

Elacatinus colini, the Belize sponge goby, is a species of goby native to the Western Central Atlantic Ocean, near Belize and Honduras. Its specific name honours Patrick L. Colin, of the Coral Reef Research Foundation, Palau, who made a comparative study of the genus "Elacatinus" for his doctoral thesis.
Appearance.
"Elacatinus colini" was originally thought to be a color variant of "E. xanthiprora" from Florida but was recently classified as its own species due to the presence of a bright white, not yellow, stripe along its body. "E. colini" are typically around 3 cm in length (3.2 cm SL for males, 3.4 cm SL for females), and can be easily identified by the white strip running from its anterior to posterior end. On the "E. colini's" head, the lateral stripe is relatively small – about the same width as its pupil. However, on its body, the lateral stripe widens to about the same width as its eye.
"E. colini" typically have 8 dorsal spines, 10-12 dorsal soft rays, 1 anal spine, 10–11 anal soft rays, and 17-19 pectoral rays. They lack scales and are covered with a thick adherent mucus. The bodies of "E. colini" are bluish-greenish gray above their lateral stripe, with the dorsal part of their head, iris, and lips exhibiting a bright yellow color and the ventral part of their body being white. Their fins are a translucent gray color.
Habitat.
"Elacatinus colini" live in marine systems in symbiotic relationships with various species of sponges, using them as shelter. They have been found to live in Carrie Bow Cay in Belize and Utila Island in Honduras. They live in shallow sponge, between deep but it is possible that they live deeper as well. "E. colini" inhabit tropical areas, 17ºN - 16ºN, 88ºW - 89ºW. According to Tassell, "E. colini" can occupy an area of about 11,184 km2.
Population.
"Elacatinus colini" were seemingly abundant in their local environment of Belize and Honduras, however, there is little data or research on their population trends.
Diet.
In a study performed by Majoris, Francisco, Atema and Buston, it was shown that "E. colini" larvae survived in higher numbers when fed wild-caught plankton as opposed to Rotifers (microscopic aquatic animals) and Artemia (a genus of aquatic crustaceans). The study also showed that the standard length of "E. colini" was higher when fed a diet of plankton as opposed to Artemia or rotifer. Researchers postulated this could be because larvae may not have developed the ability to digest Artemia and Rotifer, because Artemia could have changed water quality and thus affected the ability of the "E. colini" larvae to survive, or because the Artemia could have depleted the oxygen levels in the water and consequently lowered the survival rate of "E. colini". However, this last hypothesis is the least likely because the research tanks were well oxygenated.
Reproduction.
In the study conducted by Majoris et al., it was shown that before spawning, the bodies of both male and female "E. colini" turn dark grey/black. Researchers also concluded that "E. colini" spawned within 3–44 days of being introduced to the study tanks, which was faster than "Elacatinus lori". "E. colini" spawned in relatively small clutches in comparison to "E. lori" and spawned every 7.8 ± 1.7 days. The study also showed that male "E. colini" incubated the eggs by fanning/mouthing the clutch until it hatched, and females were sometimes observed to consume the larvae after hatching. "E. colini" spawn regularly for a period of 12 months, and embryos hatch with a fully functional mouth, inflated swim bladder, pigmented eyes, and two visible otoliths. After hatching, larvae tend to swim up to the surface of the water, as they are attracted to the light and feed on rotifers starting at around 12 hours after hatching.
Development.
"Elacatinus colini" are born with a fully functional mouth, inflated swim bladder, pigmented eyes, and two visible otoliths. After about 18–20 days post hatch (dph), fin folds are completely gone, and the pelvic and dorsal fins begin to form. At around 20–28 dph, the pelvic fin elongates but remains unfused. Pre-settled larvae have elongated snouts, partially fused pelvic fins, and exhibit the first dorsal fin. Once the pelvic fins have completely transformed into the pelvic disc, they begin to settle (earliest settlement begins at around 28 dph) and use their pelvic disc to suction onto surfaces. Settlement happens between 28–54 dph. The stripe along the body of "E. colini" develops immediately, while the yellow pigment on the snout takes a few days to develop.
Conservation.
There are no current observed threats to "E. colini", however, the degradation of sponge habitats could negatively impact the species. Monitoring of the species can prevent any threats from drastically impacting the "E. colini" population. Further research concerning threats to this species and population trends need to be performed. However, despite the species' small distribution, "E. colini" is currently categorized as a Least Concern species.

Deckergasse

The Deckergasse is a narrow lane (German: -gasse), in the Meidling district of Vienna, Austria, stretching from the Assmayergasse in the west to the Längenfeldgasse in the east.
It was named in 1909, when the area around it was being developed, in honour of the Viennese portrait artist Georg Decker (1818–1894). The official record published by Karl Lueger, Mayor of Vienna, described him as "the outstanding Viennese painter ("hervorragenden Wiener Maler")" and noted that the Deckergasse began near the end of Canalettogasse, named after Canaletto.
As a pedestrian way ("Fußweg"), the Deckergasse crosses the Wilhelmsdorfer Park, popularly known as the Decker Park, which it divides, and the only significant building on it is a school, now called the "Volksschule Deckergasse", or "Parkschule VS Deckergasse", at number 1. When the park was redesigned in 1990, the Deckergasse was left open and was integrated into it.
The Deckergasse is near the Längenfeldgasse station of the Vienna U-Bahn.

Home State

Home State is the debut studio album of American country music singer Jordan Davis. It was released via MCA Records Nashville on March 23, 2018, a week before Davis’ 30th birthday. The album contains Davis's debut single "Singles You Up" and his sophomore single "Take It from Me". The album's third single, "Slow Dance in a Parking Lot" released to country radio on April 22, 2019. The album also contains ten other songs, all of which Davis co-wrote.
Content.
Davis co-wrote every song on the album. It was produced by Paul DiGiovanni, who was the lead guitarist of the band Boys Like Girls. In advance of the album's release, Davis embarked on a headlining tour in February 2018.
Critical reception.
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic wrote that "When the tempos are swift and the production bustling -- "Take It from Me" and especially "Singles You Up," a frothy bit of country-pop that leaves a surprisingly indelible imprint—he seems to be the ringleader at happy hour, but when things slow down, as they do on "More Than I Know" and "Made That Way," he seems sensitive." Annie Reuter of "Sounds Like Nashville" reviewed the album positively, stating that "Overall a standout debut that highlights Davis' ability as both a vocalist and a songwriter, "Home State" marries big sounds and production with the vulnerability of his lyrics for a truly enjoyable listen."
Commercial performance.
"Home State" debuted at No. 6 on Top Country Albums and No. 47 the "Billboard" 200, selling 6,000 copies, or 11,000 album-equivalent units including streams and tracks. The album has sold 16,900 copies in the United States as of August 2018. The album has been streamed over 500 million times as of May 20, 2019.

Parrish, Illinois

Parrish is an unincorporated community in Cave Township, Franklin County, Illinois, United States. The community is located near Illinois Route 34 west-northwest of Thompsonville.
History.
Once a larger town, Parrish was destroyed by the Tri-State Tornado in 1925. The town, which consisted of roughly 250 residents and 40 buildings at the time, suffered a 27% casualty rate and lost all but three of its buildings: one house, the Primitive Methodist Church, and the Parrish School. As the tornado destroyed all of the town's means of outside communication, the disaster was only discovered by a passing Illinois Central train, which returned to Thompsonville to notify the surrounding towns. Much of the town's surviving population moved away following the tornado, and the town never rebuilt its infrastructure; it is now a dispersed rural community.

Juliane Okot Bitek

Juliane Okot Bitek is a Kenyan-born Ugandan-raised diasporic writer and academic, who lives, studies and works in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. She is perhaps best-known for her poetry book "100 Days", a reflection on the 100-day 1994 Rwandan genocide, in which an estimated 800,000 Tutsi and Hutu people were killed.
Biography.
Otoniya Juliane Okot Bitek was born in Kenya in 1966 to Ugandan evacuees. Her father was the late Okot p'Bitek, an internationally recognized Acholi poet and scholar. Growing up, Okot Bitek was an avid reader who was encouraged by her parents to write. The first time she had a poem of hers published, she was 11 years old.
In 1990, she migrated from Uganda and settled on the unceded lands of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil Waututh peoples. She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in creative writing (1995), a Master of Arts degree in English from the University of British Columbia. In May 2020, she completed her PhD in Interdisciplinary Studies from UBC's Liu Institute for Global Issues .
Okot Bitek is also an "ardent fan" of Leonard Cohen's music. She has two children.
Career.
Okot Bitek is a literary artist, poet, writer, scholar, and a sessional instructor at Emily Carr University of Art and Design's Faculty of Culture + Community. Her works incorporate themes of exile, home, belonging, and diaspora.
Okot Bitek is a prolific author, whose has been published in a variety of formats, including literary magazines and journals such as "ARC", "Whetstone", "Fugue," and "Room of One’s Own." In 2017, her poem "Trees Line the Street" was featured in "Transition, Issue 124: Writing Black Canadas." As of March 2021, she has contributed to "the Capilano Review" on five different occasions, from 2017-2019. The first book she published was titled "Words in Black Cinnamon: A collection of Poetry" and was published in 1998.
In 2018, her work "Sentry" was included in the anthology "Love Me True," a collection of writings about the challenges, joys, and evolutions that exist within longterm relationships, and she was a contributor to the 2019 anthology "New Daughters of Africa", edited by Margaret Busby. Her work has also been anthologized in "Great Black North: Contemporary African Canadian Poetry" (2012), "Revolving City: 51 Poems and the Stories Behind Them" (2015), and "New Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Writing by Women of African Descent".
Her book, "100 Days," was based on a "loose collaboration" with Kenyan-American artist, Wangechi Mutu. On 6 April 2014, Mutu began posting images on social media, counting down from 100. When Okot Bitek saw the first image, she knew immediately from the context that it was a countdown to the 20th anniversary of the Rwandan Genocide, and wanted to make work "to countdown with her." Okot Bitek reached out to Mutu in order to agree on a collaboration, where Okot Bitek would use text to respond to Mutu's images. As the days went on and the anniversary grew closer, her and Mutu (respectively), would post one poem and one photograph every day, as a way to create space for, and grieve in solidarity and community, the horrific events of the spring and summer of 1994. While this project evolved into a book, published through the University of Alberta Press, each of the 100 poems that are a part of this project are available to read on Okot Bitek's website.
Okot Bitek has also been a part of a variety of global poetry and writing festivals and events, including the Fraser Valley Literary Festival (2020), the Festival Internacional de Poesía de Granada in Nicaragua (2009), and the Medellín International Poetry Festival in Colombia (2008).

John Keene, one of the judges for the 2017 Glenna Luschei award, wrote of "100 Days:" “In 100 Days, poet Juliane Okot Bitek set out to memorialize the tragedy of the Rwandan genocide, but the witnessing force of these brief, incantatory poems ripples outward to figuratively encompass multiple histories of violence and brutality, including the terror her own family and countless others faced under Idi Amin’s regime in Uganda. The lyric beauty, intertextual depth, and metonymic power of Okot Bitek’s poetry underscores the capacities of art and language to cast light into the darkest corners of our human experience, and bridge the gulfs that lie between us."

Travis County STAR Flight

Travis County STAR Flight (Stylized STAR"Flight") is the emergency helicopter service of Travis County, Texas. As an agency of the Travis County government, STAR Flight conducts air ambulance, technical rescue, firefighting, and law enforcement support missions. Its area of operations includes 19 surrounding counties.
History.
1985-2015.
Travis County STAR (Shock Trauma Air Rescue) Flight began in 1985 as a joint program involving Travis County, the City of Austin, and Brackenridge Hospital. The first aircraft used by STAR Flight was a Bell 206B, later replaced with a Bell 206L3. STAR Flight originated primarily to conduct air medical transport, which still makes up the majority of missions today. The program was eventually centralized, with all personnel and equipment under direction of Travis County.
The larger Bell 412SP was added to the STAR Flight fleet in 1990, bringing further capabilities such as search and rescue and firefighting.
In 1998, Travis County began an experimental program to use STAR Flight's smaller aircraft, the 206, for law enforcement support missions. The aircraft would be available to the Sheriff's Office or other law enforcement agencies, with priority still given to medical missions. As the flight crew are not law enforcement officers, they do not provide any support on the ground and are limited to aerial surveillance.
STAR Flight replaced its original aircraft with two Eurocopter EC135s in 1999. Besides the aircraft and avionics being newer, using two aircraft of the same model helped to simplify operations and maintenance.
In 2001, Travis County STAR Flight became the first public-safety program to receive accreditation from the Commission on Accreditation of Medical Transport Systems.
The EC135s were replaced in 2006 with two Eurocopter EC145s, with a third EC145 added to the fleet in 2010.
Beginning in 2012, STAR Flight based one aircraft at Dell Children's Medical Center. Until that time, STAR Flight's only hospital-based operations had been from Brackenridge Hospital.
In 2013, STAR Flight added a Bell UH-1H to its fleet as a dedicated firefighting aircraft. This was largely in response to the 2011 wildfire in Bastrop, during which STAR Flight conducted extensive fire suppression efforts utilizing EC145s and Bambi Buckets. The aircraft had seen service with the Army in Vietnam, and was refurbished for STAR Flight by Northwest Helicopters. The aircraft was re-outfitted for firefighting during refurbishment, including the installation of a 325-gallon fixed tank.
Death of Kristin McClain.
On the evening of April 27, 2015, STAR Flight was conducting a hoist rescue of an injured hiker in the Barton Creek Greenbelt. Kristin Elizabeth McClain, the flight nurse and rescuer on the mission, was being lifted to the aircraft with the patient when she fell from the hoist. She died at the scene from injuries sustained in the fall.
The final report by the National Transportation Safety Board concluded that there had been no equipment failures, and that the McClain was not properly fastened to the hoist.
In the immediate aftermath of the incident, STAR Flight temporarily suspended operations. Following the NTSB investigation and report, the organization implemented additional safety checks by fellow crew members, as well as checks by first responders on the ground when feasible.
At Dell Children's Medical Center, a memorial plaque was unveiled at the helipad, which was named in McClain's honor. In 2019, four years after McClain's death, the STAR Flight hangar and base of operations in east Austin was named the Kristin E. McClain Building.
McClain's death was STAR Flight's first work fatality in its 30 years of operation.
2015-Present.
On May 21, 2017, Brackenridge Hospital was closed, with all hospital operations moved to the new Dell Seton Medical Center at the University of Texas. STAR Flight was included in this transfer, with one aircraft now based at the new hospital and one aircraft still based at Dell Children's Medical Center.
In October 2017, Travis County awarded a contract to AgustaWestland Philadelphia Corporation to replace the existing fleet with three AW169s. 
Airbus Helicopters, which lost the bid for the new fleet, filed a protest with Travis County which rejected it. Airbus filed an appeal with the County Commissioners Court, which rejected the appeal at a hearing in February 2018.
The AW169s were delivered by June 2019 and entered operational service two months later. 
Flight Crew.
Each aircraft is staffed with a pilot, a nurse, and a paramedic.

Masih (title)

 () is the Arabic translation of the Hebrew title (, 'Messiah') or the Greek title (, 'Christ'), meaning "the anointed one". It is the common word used by Arab Christians for 'Christ', a usage which was adopted by both Christians and Muslims in a number of languages influenced by Arabic.
It also occurs eleven times in the Quran as a title for Jesus (ʿĪsā), both followed by his proper name as "the Messiah/Christ Jesus the Son of Mary" (three times) or "the Messiah/Christ the Son of Mary" (five times) and independently as "the Messiah/Christ" (three times). The title was interpreted in many different ways by Muslim exegetes, all of which tended to downplay the connection of the word to Jesus' central role in Christianity as the savior-God.
Historical background.
It was a common practice in the ancient Near East to confer kingship to new rulers by anointing them, rather than by crowning them. It is in this context that the Hebrew term (Messiah, meaning "anointed") was originally used, referring to an eschatological figure who was expected to rise from the royal line of David and who would rule like a divine king, being God's 'anointed one'. Among Christians, Jesus was recognized as fulfilling this role of Messiah, and the authors of the New Testament generally referred to Jesus as ("Jesus Christ" or "Jesus the Messiah") or as ("the Christ Jesus" or "the Messiah Jesus").
In the Quran.
In the Quran, however, the original meaning of the word as "anointed" seems to play no role of significance, and the term appears to have simply become a title commonly affixed to Jesus' name, not unlike the usage of the word 'Christ' in English. Although many interpreters of the Quran did recognize the Arabic word (derived from , 'to wipe', 'to touch', 'to stroke', 'to anoint') as meaning "anointed", they did not connect the concept of being anointed with a Davidic messianic figure.
Many interpretations of the word existed. The Arabic lexicographer Fairuzabadi (1329–1414) listed no less than 49 different meanings for the title as elaborated by Quranic exegetes. Most exegetes (correctly) understood the word to be equivalent to the passive principle of the root m-s-ḥ, meaning 'wiped', 'touched', 'anointed'. Interpretations based on this derivation included that Jesus had been called thus because he had been 'touched' by the wing of the archangel Gabriel at birth in order to safeguard him from Satan, because he had been 'anointed' with oil (as all the prophets in Islamic tradition), or because he had been 'anointed' with the blessing (Arabic: ) of God. Other interpretations took the word to be an active form of the root m-s-ḥ, meaning 'wiping', 'touching', etc. This interpretation was often connected to the idea of Jesus as healing the sick by 'touching' them, or because he purified believers by 'wiping' away their sins. This latter interpretation, which among others was given by the Ismaili jurist al-Qāḍī al-Nu‘mān (died 974), was often criticized because it violates the principle found throughout the Quran that every believer is responsible for their own virtues and sins, and that only God can forgive sin. Finally, some interpreters of the Quran took the word to be derived not from the root m-s-ḥ, but rather from the root s-y-ḥ, meaning 'to travel', believing Jesus to have received this title because of his itinerant lifestyle.

Take Me Out (Australian game show)

Take Me Out was an Australian television dating game show hosted by Joel Creasey and premiered on the Seven Network from 3 September 2018 until 27 November 2018. The show was filmed at Fox Studios Australia.
"Take Me Out" is essentially based on the same format as "Taken Out", a 2008 dating game show developed by FremantleMedia and hosted by James Kerley. International versions of the show began screening in Denmark as ' ("Today's Man") from 2008, with the Netherlands the first country to use the title "'" in 2009. Other successful versions have screened in Britain and Ireland.
In June 2019, the series was cancelled and would not return for a second season.
Format.
The objective of the show is for a single man to obtain a date with one of thirty single women. The women stand on stage underneath thirty white lights, each with a button in front of them. A single man is then brought on stage and tries to persuade the women to agree to a date in a series of rounds, playing a pre-recorded video discussing his background, displaying a skill (such as dancing or playing a musical instrument), or playing another video in which the man's friends or family reveal more about his virtues and philosophy.
At any point during the rounds, the women can press the button in front of them to turn off their light if they do not believe a date with this man would be constructive to their well-being and if this occurs, their area of the stage will turn red. If, at the end of three rounds, there are lights still left on, the bachelor will turn off all but two remaining lights. He will then have a chance to ask one question to the last two women, before choosing which woman he wants to go on the date with by turning off one more light.
Alternatively, if the man had been left with two lights at the end of round 3, he will just ask his question to the two remaining women but if there is only one light left at the end of round 3, he will go on the date with that girl without asking her his question. If all the women turn off their lights before the end of the third round - this is referred to as a "blackout" - then the man must leave the show without going on a date.

T. S. R. Subramanian v. Union of India

T. S. R. Subramanian versus Union of India and Ors., was an a landmark decision of the Supreme Court of India in which the Court ruled that civil servants were not bound to follow oral directives. The case began with a public interest civil writ petition filed before the Supreme Court of India and was decided in October 2013.
Premise.
The case was filed as a public interest civil writ petition by T. S. R. Subramanian, retired Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer and former Cabinet Secretary; T. S. Krishnamurthy, retired IAS officer and former Chief Election Commissioner; N. Gopalaswami, retired IAS officer and former Chief Election Commissioner; Abid Hussain, retired IAS officer and former Indian ambassador to the United States; Ved Prakash Marwah, retired Indian Police Service (IPS) officer and former Manipur governor; Joginder Singh, retired IPS officer and former director of the Central Bureau of Investigation, and 77 others in 2011. It was heard by a division bench comprising justices K. S. Panicker Radhakrishnan and Pinaki Chandra Ghose from 2011 to 2013.
The petitioners were retired top civil servants from—among others—the IAS and the IPS. They sought mandatory court injunctions to support the independence of the various Indian civil services and their freedom from political interference, by requiring the Indian federal and state governments to implement the recommendations made by several commissions of review (including the Hota Commission): that oral instructions given by politicians to civil servants must be recorded in writing, that senior civil service appointments should be made for a fixed term, and that civil services boards should be established to advise on postings. In addition, politicians in state government were seen to have been transferring civil servants repeatedly.
Judgment.
Major rulings in the case included:
Reaction.
The supreme court decision received a mostly-positive reaction and was considered a "major reform".
Indian Administrative Service Association secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy said, "[we] support the judgement. It vindicates our stand. It will help in good governance across the country". According to Indian Forest Service Association president A. R. Chadha, the ruling would check arbitrary transfers and suspensions. A Bharatiya Janata Party secretary-general, Dharmendra Pradhan, said that it would "help bring greater transparency the system". Pradhan added that the "decision should not hamper government functioning, especially development work being carried out by the government".
An Indian National Congress spokesperson, P. C. Chacko, disagreed: "[t]o discharge the responsibilities of the executive effectively, the power of transfer and posting of the officials should be with the government. For effective administration, the discretion should be with the political authority. Any infringement of this authority will not be good for the country,”. The president of the Centre for Policy Research tweeted, "[o]n the face of it, supreme court is continuing its constitutional usurpation; and many orders are practically unworkable".

Sheikh Abdul Hye Bacchu is a Bangladesh Jatiya politician and former Member of Parliament from Bagerhat-1. 
Career.
Bachchu was elected to parliament from Bagerhat-1 as a candidate of Jatiya Party in 1988. He claimed to have a close ties with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. In 2011 he opened a deep sea fishing company, Eden Fisheries Ltd, and by 2013 had bought 11 ships for 1.5 billion taka.
Bachchu served as the chairman of Basic Bank from September 2009 to 2013. Basic Bank is a state owned bank in Bangladesh.
Controversy.
During Bachchu's chairmanship more than 20 billion taka was embezzled from the bank. In 2015 Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission filled 56 cases regarding the corruption in the bank. According to Bangladesh Bank, 45 billion taka in total was embezzled from the bank from 2010 to 2013, during the chairmanship of Bachchu. In July 2017 Bangladesh High Court ordered Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission to investigate his alleged role in the Basic Bank scam. He was interrogated by Bangladesh Anti Corruption Commission on 5 December 2017 for the first time since the cases were filled. He was interrogated by the Commission again on 8 January 2018. According to the investigation of Bangladesh Financial Intelligence Unit in 2014, 200 million taka was transferred from firms that received fraudulent loans from Basic Bank to the accounts of the younger brother of Bachchu. Bachchu's younger brother, Sheikh Shariar Panna, used to help arrange loans from the bank while talking a large percentage of the loans as "consultancy fees". The Finance Minister of Bangladesh, Abul Maal Abdul Muhith, said that massive embezzlement took place in Basic Bank and that Bachchu was responsible for it.

Garuda Party

The Garuda Party () is a political party in Indonesia that contested the 2019 general election. The party has been linked to the family of former president Suharto. Officials have denied the party is linked to the Suharto family or to former general Prabowo Subianto's Gerindra Party. Garuda declared itself to be neutral in the April 2019 presidential election, although some of its officials and legislative candidates voiced support for Prabowo.
Background.
In 2007, former information minister Harmoko, also a former chairman of Golkar, founded the National People’s Party (PKN), which failed to qualify for the 2009 general election. In April 2015, PKN was renamed the Change Indonesia Movement Party (Garuda). The party’s constitution, bylaws, symbol and senior figures were all changed, making it unrecognizable from PKN.
Garuda Party was registered with the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights on 16 April 2015. The party espouses a nationalist platform.
Little was known of the party's leaders or policies prior to its registration for the 2019 election being accepted by the General Elections Commission (KPU) in October 2017. Party chairman Ahmad Ridha Sabana has said Garuda Party is a party of young people who want to contribute to national development.
According to KPU data, Garuda Party has 693,191 members across 509 of Indonesia's 514 regencies, and 36.36% of its members are women.

Controversies.
Garuda Party chairman Ahmad Ridha Sabana in February 2018 denied media reports that the party was linked to Tutut Suharto. He said Garuda is independent and was “built by youths”. He admitted to working for Tutut in the past but said he was no longer president director of her TPI (now MNCTV) television network. He also denied his party was connected to Gerindra Party, although he acknowledged he had in 2014 stood as a Gerindra candidate for the Jakarta provincial legislative assembly. He also admitted his brother Ahmad Riza Patria was a Gerindra politician.
Ridha denied Garuda Party’s name and mythical garuda bird emblem were deliberately similar to Gerindra’s name and garuda bird logo. He also rejected claims that Garuda Party’s bird design resembles the Nazi party's eagle emblem.

Dihi Panchannagram

Dihi Panchannagram was a group of 55 villages which the East India Company purchased in 1758 from Mir Jafar, after the fall of Siraj-ud-daulah, the last independent Nawab of Bengal, in what is now the city of Kolkata, earlier known as Calcutta, in Kolkata district, in the Indian state of West Bengal. These villages initially developed as suburbs of Kolkata, but now forms part of the city proper within the limits of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.
Background.
In the early years of the 18th century, Calcutta was a small settlement spread across a narrow stretch on the east bank of the Hooghly. Most of the English residences were to be found around what was then the fort in Kalikata. To its north was "Sutanuti hat" (cotton and yarn market), and still north lay the native area of Sutanuti. To the south, Gobindapur was a forested area. Beyond the English settlement lay Chitpur and Kalighat, and across the river lay Betor and Salkia. In 1742, the Marathas burst into Bengal, and Nawab Alivardy Khan required all his energy and skills to keep them at bay. They laid waste the countryside. There was a feeling of insecurity in the English settlement and they procured the permission of the Nawab to build a protective ditch around the settlement. When a part of the Maratha Ditch was ready, the realisation dawned that the Marathas were not going to attack Calcutta. The project was abandoned but the ditch remained a sort of a boundary for the English settlement.
Dihis and mouzas.
The 55 villages were known en-bloc as "Dihi Panchannagram" and their details are as follows (old archaic spellings for the places retained): 
"Dihi Sinthee" (1. Sinthee 2. Cossipur 3. Paikpara). 
"Dihi Chitpore" (4. Chitpore 5. Tallah 6. Beerpara 7. Kalidaha). 
"Dihi Bagzollah" (8. Dakhindarie 9. Kankooria 10. Noabad). 
"Dihi Dakhin Paikparah" (11. Belgachya). 
"Dihi Ooltadangah" (12. Ooltadangah 13. Bagmari 14. Gouriberh). 
"Dihi Similiah" (15. Bahir Similiah 16. Narikeldanga). 
"Dihi Soorah" (17. Soorah 18. Kankoorgatchi 19. Koochnan 20. Duttabad). 
"Dihi Cooliah" (21. Mullickabad 22. Cooleah). 
"Dihi Sealdah" (23. Sealdah 24. Baliaghata). 
"Dihi Entally" (25. Entally 26. Pagladanga 27. Neemuckpota 28. Gobrah 29. Tangrah). 
"Dihi Topsiah" (30. Topsea 31. Tiljulla 32. Baniapooker 33. Kareya). 
"Dihi Serampur" (34. Chowbagah 35. Dhullunda 36. Sanpgatchee 37. Auntobad 38. Nonadanga 39. Bondel–Ooloberia 40. Beddeadanga 41. Koostea 42. Purannuggur 43. Ghoogoodanga 44. Serampur). 
"Dihi Chukerberh" (45. Ballygunj 46. Gudshaha 47. Chuckerberh). 
"Dihi Bhowanipur" (48. Bhowanipur 49. Neejgram). 
"Dihi Monoharpur" (50. Beltola 51. Kalighat 52. Monoharpur 53. Moodeali 54. Shahnagar 55. Koykalee).
P. Thankappan Nair says that the English obtained from the Mughal emperor Farrukhsiyar, in 1717, the right to rent from 38 villages surrounding their settlement. Of these 5 lay across the Hooghly in what is now Howrah district. These were – Salkia, Haora, Kusundia, Ramkrishnapur and Betor. The remaining 33 villages on the Calcutta side were (spellings have been modernised): Dakshin Paikpara, Belgachia, Dakshin Dari, Bahir Dakshin Dari, Chitprur, Hoglakundi (or Hoglakuria), Ultadanga, Shimulia (or Shimla), Macond, Kamarpara, Kankurgachi, Bagmari, Shura, Bahir Shura, Dolland, Shrirampur, Chaubaga, Tapsia, Shiltala, Sangassey, Gobra, Kulia, Tangra, Hintalee (or Entali), Colimba, Jal Colimba, Shealdah, Mirzapur, Arcooley, Birjee, Chourangi, Shehparra and Garedalparra. These villages gradually reconstituted themselves as 55 mouzas and hance the name "Panchannagram". These were grouped under 15 dihis.
H.E.A. Cotton says that in addition to the comparatively small British settlement, which was defined in a proclamation dated 10 September 1794, primarily as the area within the Maratha Ditch, the 55 villages of Panchannagram formed the suburbs beyond the ditch. They were spread over an area of 23 square miles and even in the early 20th century were under the magisterial and revenue jurisdiction of 24 Parganas.
Thanas.
Along with the "dihis" and "mouzas", noted above, another administrative division for the development of an integrated colonial settlement was the "thana" or police station. In the earlier days, the police stations also looked after the civic needs of the people. The earliest list of "thanas" was prepared in 1785 (names modernised): Armenian Church, Old Fort, Chandpal Ghat, ‘South of the Great Tank’ (Lal Dighi or B.B.D. Bagh tank), Dharmatala, Old Court House, Domtala, Amragali and Panchanantala, China Bazar, Chandni Chowk, ‘Trul Bazar’, Jhamapukur, Charakdanga, Simla Bazar, ‘Lallunch’ (Raja Ramlochan’s) Bazar, Malancha and Pataldanga, Kabardanga, Baitakkhana, Shyampukur, Shyambazar, Padmapukur, Kumartuli, Jorasanko, Mechhuabazar, Jan Bazar, Dingabhanga, Sutanuti Hatkhola, Daychata, Hanspukur, Colimba and Jorabagan.
In 1888, these "thanas" were regrouped under 25 Police Section Houses. The 25 wards created under the Calcutta Municipal Act of 1889, precisely matched these divisions. The final picture of old Calcutta had emerged. We present here a brief of the 25 Police Section Houses: 
1. Shyampukur, the citadel of Bengali aristocracy. It was long overtaken by the adjacent settlements of Shyambazar and Baghbazar.
2. Kumartuli, still retains its fame for clay images.
3. Bartala, the area where the Rajas of Shobhabazar, the most orthodox Hindus of Calcutta, lived.
4. Sukeas (corrupted to Sukea) Street, named after Armenian Merchant, Peter Sukeas.
5. Jorabagan or Jora Bari Bag. 
6. Jorasanko, the seat of the Tagore family.
7. Barabazar, the market has been traced back to 1738, as the old Sutanati hat, but the present-day wholesale market was a creation of the Marwaris, who achieved phenomenal success in the second half of the 19th century. 
8. Kalutola, the home of the oil pressers, harks back to the beginning of the 18th century.
9. Muchipara, the home of the cobblers, was not there in 1785 and so must have come up subsequently. 
10. Boubazar, "bahu" or bride’s market, can be traced back to 1739. 
11. Padmapukur, adjacent to Boubazar, is difficult to locate. The Byaparitola tank in Dingabhanga became Wellington Square (now Subodh Mallick Square). 
12. Waterloo Street Police Section was split among three sections in 1785: Old Fort, ‘South of the Great Tank’ and Old Court House. 
13. Fenwick’s Bazar, named after Edward Fenwick, stood east of the present New Market. 
14. Taltala is a Muslim dominated area. 
15. Kalinga, takes its name from colimba or musk melon. 
16. Park Street, earlier known as Badamtala, then as Burial Ground Road, and finally Park Street in 1840s, because of Sir Elijah Impey’s deer park. 
17. Bamun Bustee, a slum area occupied by the servants of the Park Street "sahibs", later converted to a European neighbourhood.
18. Hastings, initially a Muslim burial ground, then ‘Coolie Bazar’ for workmen who built Fort William, and then a township for Ordnance and Commissariat department people. 
19. Entali, once part of salt lakes beyond the Maratha Ditch, later a marshy area for economically distressed sections of society. 
20. Beniapukur, the home of the merchants, is mentioned from the mid-eighteenth century, but the "thana" dates from early 19th century. 
21. Baliganj and Tollyganj formed a combined "thana". Baliganj grew up around a market for sand and had garden-houses of 18th century Europeans. Baliganj emerged as a citadel of the educated Bengali middle class after the suburban railway opened up the area. Tollyganj was earlier called Rasa Pagla, and in the 18th century, it had European garden-houses in a predominantly jungle area. Tipu Sultan’s sons settled down in the area after the Vellore Mutiny in 1806. 
22. Bhabanipur existed as a "dihi" in 1765 and also absorbed a part of Dihi Chakraberia. It is said the original shrine of Kali, stood here on the bank of the Adi Ganga, a ‘small brook’ and was shifted to the present site at Kalighat, about a mile away, in 1809. The construction of Harish Mukherjee Road and Lansdowne Road (now Sarat Bose Road) and extension of Hazra Road to Kalighat, opened up the area at the beginning of the 20th century. 
23. Alipur, initially a Muslim locality, was taken over by the British elite, late in the 18th century. Alipur became the headquarters of 24 Parganas district and acquired military installations. It has a meteorological observatory. The Belvedere Estate, once the Lieutenant Governor’s palace, now houses the National Library of India. Around it are Hastings House, the Zoological Garden and the gardens of the Agri-Horticultural Society. 
24. Ekbalpore developed as a Muslim neighbourhood with the settlement of those displaced for the construction of the zoo at Zirat in Alipur police station, and King George’s Docks (now Netaji Subhas Docks) at Garden Reach, as well as migration of Momins or weavers from Bihar and UP. 
25. Watganj is named after Colonel Henry Watson, who set the first dockyards in Bengal. 
Outside the area of the 25 Police Section Houses, mention may be made of Garden Reach, which became a Muslim area when Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, with a large entourage settled in Metiabruz.

Jenny Parks

Jenny Parks is an American comics artist, fan artist and scientific illustrator. Parks is most known for her fan art pieces "Doctor Mew" ("Doctor Who"s the Doctor as cats) and "The Catvengers" (the Avengers also as cats) and her books "Star Trek Cats" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation Cats".
Background.
Parks started drawing cat versions of people since about age 11 or 12. Around 12, she loved "The Phantom of the Opera" and had a running gag about "The Phantom of the Cats". Eventually, she drew the characters as cats. A few years later, Parks became obsessed with the British television series "Doctor Who". Around 2008, Parks began drawing more realistic "Doctor Who" cats.
Parks has a Bachelor's degree (BFA) in Illustration from the California College of Arts and a graduate degree in scientific illustration from the UC Santa Cruz. Previously, Parks drew wildlife like big cats, birds, dinosaurs, fruit bats, insects, and plants. Her work can be found via iPhone apps for the National Park Service. Parks would regularly attend conventions as C2E2, San Diego Comic-Con, and WonderCon.
Parks' art is drawn and painted digitally via Paint Tool SAI and Photoshop. Parks creates her art digitally with a Cintiq graphics tablet via Photoshop. Her fan art career took off with a table at the 2011 San Diego Comic-Con where she had "Doctor Mew" buttons and posters as well as when "Doctor Mew" went viral. Parks became famous due to "Doctor Mew". Later, Parks created other fan art pieces as "The Catvengers". "Doctor Mew" represented her most prominent work until "Star Trek Cats" in 2017. In March 2018, "Star Trek Cats" was followed-up with "Star Trek: The Next Generation Cats". Parks also has a Patreon account.

Marvel Comics Senior Editor Steve Wacker found Jenny Parks at her booth at San Diego Comic-Con and approached her to do animal variant covers for Marvel and she said "Absolutely!" Parks has done animal variant covers for issues "Iron Man" #23, "The Superior Spider-Man" #27, "Thor: God of Thunder" #19, and "Wolverine and the X-Men" #1. On May 13, 2013, Tumblr user sparkysmachine dressed their cat Sir Didymus to match the "Thor: God of Thunder" #19 animal variant cover. The "mini-Mjolnir and shoulder-thingies" were printed on their PrintrBot Jr. 3D printer. On October 29, 2014, to celebrate National Cat Day, Marvel Comics reposted Parks's animal variant covers on their Facebook page.

"Petslady.com"s Laurie Kay Olson deigned her work "delightful, entertaining, and more than just a little bit, well, catty."

Sakamichi Series

 refers to a Japanese idol group franchise that began with Nogizaka46, an "official" rival group of AKB48. Based on AKB48's "idols you can meet" concept, it currently consists of four groups.
History.
The first group, Nogizaka46, was formed on August 22, 2011 and released their debut single "Guruguru Curtain" on February 22, 2012.
The second group, and Nogizaka46's first sister group, Keyakizaka46, was created on August 21, 2015. It was initially named Toriizaka46 before it was changed. They released their first single "Silent Majority" on April 6, 2016. A sub group known as "Hiragana Keyakizaka46" was created shortly after. On July 16, 2020, it was announced that Keyakizaka46 would change the group's name and rebrand, with the new name being Sakurazaka46. The change came into effect on October 14.
On February 21, 2018, Yoshimotozaka46 was created as the third group in the franchise. It is a much different group than the other three in that it contains both male and female members of various ages, and most members are Japanese entertainers. Unlike the other groups, Yoshimotozaka46 is named after the company that manages many Japanese comedians, the 48 group NMB48 and Produce 101 Japan group JO1 and is based in Osaka. They released their first single, "Nakasete Kure yo", on December 26, 2018.
On February 11, 2019, Hiragana Keyakizaka46, the sub-group of Sakurazaka46 (still named Keyakizaka46 at the time), became independent and changed its name to Hinatazaka46, thus becoming the fourth group in the franchise. They released their debut single, "Kyun", on March 27, 2019.
In the summer of 2018, a joint Sakamichi Audition was held and 36 of those that auditioned were accepted. Of the 36, 21 were immediately accepted into one of Nogizaka46 (11), Keyakizaka46 (9), and Hinatazaka46 (1). The other 15 were grouped as Sakamichi Kenshusei in 2019. On February 16, 2020, 14 of the trainees were finally assigned to the three groups, with five going to Nogizaka46, six going to Sakurazaka46, and three going to Hinatazaka46. The remaining member dropped out at some point.
In 2021, members of Nogizaka46, Sakurazaka46, and Hinatazaka46 co-starred in the mystery television drama "Borderless", based on by Tetsuya Honda. It would be their first collaboration in a television drama.

Golden Guardians

The Golden Guardians (GG) are an American esports organization owned by the Golden State Warriors. The organization was one of four that joined the "League of Legends" Championship Series (LCS) in 2018 after the league began franchising, the others being 100 Thieves, Clutch Gaming and OpTic Gaming. On December 18, 2019, the Golden Guardians announced their expansion into the professional scenes of "Apex Legends", "Teamfight Tactics" and "World of Warcraft".
"Super Smash Bros. Melee" player Zain "Zain" Naghmi and "Teamfight Tactics" player David "DogDog" Caero were signed by the Golden Guardians on February 6, 2020. On April 2, 2021, the organization announced the signings of "Super Smash Bros. Melee" player Edgard "n0ne" L.

"League of Legends".
LCS team.
History.
The Golden Guardians finalized their roster for the 2018 NA LCS Spring Split on December 13, 2017, signing top laner Samson "Lourlo" Jackson, jungler Juan "Contractz" Arturo Garcia, mid laner Hai "Hai" Du Lam, bot laner Matthew "Deftly" Chen and support Matthew "Matt" Elento, with Choi "Locodoco" Yoon-seop as head coach for the team. On February 4, 2018, Locodoco was fired after making inappropriate remarks towards a female member of Riot Games' esports staff. The final decision was made by the Golden State Warriors, the parent company of the Golden Guardians, who cited their strict zero tolerance policy. Assistant coach Tyler Perron was subsequently promoted to interim head coach to fill the vacant position. The team finished the regular season of the 2018 NA LCS Spring Split in tenth place with a 4–14 record.
On April 23, 2018, the Golden Guardians acquired mid laner Young-min "Mickey" Son from Team Liquid, in preparation for the 2018 NA LCS Summer Split. Shortly afterwards, Hai announced his retirement from competitive play for the second time and left the team.
The Golden Guardians ended the 2018 NA LCS Summer Split in tenth place, with a 5–13 record, becoming the first team in the league's history to finish last two splits in a row.
In preparation for the 2019 LCS Spring Split (which had recently renamed to exclude "NA" from its title), the Golden Guardians acquired Kevin "Hauntzer" Yarnell and Kim "Olleh" Joo-sung from Team SoloMid and Team Liquid respectively. Veteran player Henrik "Froggen" Hansen later joined the team to complete the roster. The Golden Guardians also hired Nick "Inero" Smith as the Golden Guardians' new head coach and Danan Flander, former Cloud9 senior general manager, as the team's first general manager.
Despite a disappointing start to the 2019 LCS Spring Split, the Golden Guardians managed to end the regular season in fifth place after losing a tiebreaker match to FlyQuest, with a 9–9 record. This secured the team their first appearance in playoffs, where they narrowly lost 2–3 to FlyQuest in the quarterfinals. During the first half of the summer split the Golden Guardians kept the same starting lineup from the spring split, but later opted to promote bot laner Victor "FBI" Huang and support Choi "Huhi" Jae-hyun from the academy team. Deftly was later traded to Cloud9 Academy for Yuri "Keith" Jew. The Golden Guardians ended the summer split tied for sixth with 100 Thieves and OpTic Gaming. After losing their tiebreaker match to OpTic Gaming, the Golden Guardians were locked out of playoffs.
"Super Smash Bros. Melee".
History.
"Super Smash Bros. Melee" player Zain "Zain" Naghmi was signed by the Golden Guardians on February 6, 2020. During 2020, Zain has won Pound Online, the Ludwig Ahgren Championship Series 2, and Smash Summit 10, all three of which took place online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 20, 2020, Golden Guardians hosted "The Octagon", a one-night showcase of some of Melee's top players competing in a first-to-five wins matchup with the main event being Zain vs Joseph "Mang0" Manuel Marquez, which Zain won 5–2.
On April 2, 2021, the organization announced the signings of "Super Smash Bros. Melee" player Edgard "n0ne" L. Sheleby, inactive player and streamer Kevin "PPMD" Nanney and commentator Kris "Toph" Aldenderfer.

Solo a Genova is a live solo album by keyboardist Jamie Saft recorded at the Teatro Carlo Felice in Italy and released on the RareNoise label in early 2018.
Reception.
On All About Jazz, Dan McClenaghan said "Pianist Jamie Saft's Solo A Genova is a revelation ... he proves himself strikingly virtuosic, lushly harmonic, and beautifully fluid ... "Solo A Genova" showcases his uplifting, steeped-in-the-American-sound soul" while Doug Collete noted "Jamie Saft's first solo album in his twenty-five year career, "Solo a Genova", captures this restless, daring artist interpreting a selection of songs that reflect his eclectic taste as a reflection of his customary willingness to challenge himself. The sum effect of hearing this recording from Italy in March of 2017 is an altogether glorious experience made all the more stirring by the inclusion of audience applause". Broadway World observed ""Solo a Genova" is Saft's highly emotive take on jazz standards and other uniquely American compositions ... The rare, emotional outpouring and transformative power of Saft's piano is in evidence throughout "Solo a Genova", his brilliant solo piano debut". A Jazz Noise's Dave Foxall wrote "Jamie Saft’s first solo album is an unrestrained experience, taking an eclectic mix of material – jazz, rock, pop, blues, modernist classical, and a few Saft originals – and creating an hour’s coherent listening without sacrificing any of the variety ... Blues spirit, classical lyricism, jazz dexterity – as solo piano albums go, slot it into your collection right next to "Mingus Plays Piano", Jarrett’s "Köln" and Monk’s "Alone in San Francisco".

Afrololigo

Afrololigo mercatoris, commonly known as the Guinean thumbstall squid, is a small species of squid in the family Loliginidae from the eastern central Atlantic Ocean. It is the only species in the monotypic genus "Afrololigo".
Description.
"Afrololigo mercatoris" is a relatively small species of squid where the females reach a mantle length of 50mm and the males attain 35mm. Its mantle is wide, the width being equal to around 35% of the length of the mantle, and blunt at the posterior end. It has short, round fins, equalling 40-45% of the length of the mantle and between 55% and 65% of mantle length in width, with a convex margin at the rear. The head is short and the 
short and there are no buccal suckers on the buccal lappets. The tentacular club is small and narrow with suckers which are set out in 4 longitudinal series, 4 or 5 pairs of medial suckers on the central part of the club, the manus which are enlarged when compared to the lateral suckers. The club suckers have rings of 15 to 25 sharp teeth which become more pointed and increase in size towards the tip. Its dorsal arms are very short in comparison with its other arms and in males the left ventral arm is hectocotylized. The arm has 6 to 12 pairs of normal suckers at its base with the suckers replaced towards the tip by elongate papillae, these are more strongly developed in the dorsal row.
Distribution and ecology.
"Afrololigo mercatoris" occurs only off the west coast of Africa from Rio de Oro in Mauritania) to Lüderitz Bay in Namibia. This species is collected from depths of less than 50 m where there are mud and sandy-mud substrates. There is very little data available on its life cycle and biology. The eggs are small and the spermatophores
have long bodies made of cement. This species is not a species of interest to fisheries.
Taxonomy.
"Afrololigo mercatoris" shows some morphological similarity with the squids of the genus "Lolliguncula", which is where William Adam originbally placed it when he described this species. However, based on morphology, genetic data and distribution "Afrololigo"was recognised as a distinct monotypic genus. The Red Sea species "Uroteuthis abulati" was also thought to be close to "A. mercatoris".

AIM center

The Autophagy, Inflammation and Metabolism Center or AIM Center is an NIH-funded Center of Biomedical Research Excellence focused on the study of autophagy as a fundamental biological process and how it intersects with metabolism and quality control processes in eukaryotic cells. A special emphasis is on the role or autophagy in a wide spectrum of diseases with metabolic, inflammatory and immunological aspects. At the fundamental level, autophagy is a cytoplasmic pathway for the disposal of damaged or surplus organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes, lysosomes, endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, protein aggregates and also serves as a catabolic process providing nutrients through autodigestion at times of starvation. Autophagy has been implicated in cancer, neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease, diabetes, development, infections and immune diseases, as well as a process of relevance for aging.
The purpose of the AIM center is to promote autophagy research at the international, national and regional levels and to provide resources to communities of scholars interested in this process in any context including basic science or translational research. AIM has scientific cores providing technical resources for study of autophagy, accessible to its members, associate members as well as to a group of international affiliate members. It provides a mentoring structure for support of junior faculty enrolled with the center and promotes collaborative multidisciplinary studies centered on the key thematic focus of the AIM center – fundamental study of autophagy and its role in disease. The AIM has International Council of Affiliate Members (ICAM) on all continents (see figure). The ICAM is complemented by the National Council of Affiliate (NCAM) members. NCAM is organized in sections by clinical disciplines/specialties, and at present has cardiology and nephrology sections.
The center hosts annual meetings and workshops with national and international reach and impact.
The AIM center leads and supports cutting edge research, including supporting research pilots for the COVID-19 pandemic.
The AIM center is hosting, together with the "Journal of Cell Science", the 2020 international AIM eSymposium on covid, autophagy, inflammation and metabolism.

Tillie Walden

Tillie Walden (born 1996) is an American cartoonist who has published five graphic novels and a webcomic. Walden won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work for her graphic novel "Spinning", making her one of the youngest Eisner Award winners ever.
Early life.
Tillie Walden grew up in New Jersey and Austin, Texas. Walden was shaped by her childhood move from New Jersey to Texas. She was a competitive ice skater.
Walden is named after her paternal grandmother, an artist who died before Walden was born. Walden's first comic was a black-and-white comic "about never knowing her [grandmother] but following in her footsteps." A workshop led by Scott McCloud had been a major turning point in her career, given it "really inspired [her] to draw some comics, and around this time [she] was also becoming increasingly bored with fine art".
Growing up, Walden read a lot of manga. This greatly influenced her work, leading her to focus more on line than shape or color. The biggest manga artist that had an impact on her was Yoshihiro Togashi, creator of the manga "Hunter x Hunter". Additionally, in an interview, Walden said "Studio Ghibli has completely shaped my visual vocabulary and how I think about stories." Walden is said to have also been influenced by graphic memoirs, such as "Fun Home" by Alison Bechdel, "Blankets" by Craig Thompson and "Stitches" by David Small.
Walden began putting her comics and drawings on her website, and was discovered while still in high school by British publisher Avery Hill Publishing, who worked with Walden to publish her first graphic novel, "The End of Summer".
Career.
Walden's debut graphic novel, "The End of Summer", was published by Avery Hill in June 2015. It is told from the viewpoint of Lars, a feeble boy who lives in a fantastical palace and has a giant cat named Nemo. In an interview with Paul Gravett, she dedicates the book to her twin brother, John. She describes the main characters as being a mishmash of her and John. Walden won the 2016 Ignatz Award for outstanding artist for "The End of Summer".
Her second graphic novel, "I Love This Part", was published by Avery Hill in November 2015 and tells the story of two teenage girls who fall in love. Walden won the 2016 Ignatz Award for promising new talent for "I Love This Part". The novel was also nominated for the 2016 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue/One-Shot.
Walden's third graphic novel, "A City Inside", was published by Avery Hill in 2016. It won the 2016 "Broken Frontier" Award for Best One-Shot.
"Spinning", Walden's first graphic novel memoir about her years coming-of-age as a competitive ice skater, was published by First Second Books in September 2017. Originally, "Spinning" was Walden's thesis work for the Center for Cartoon Studies (CCS) during her second year of schooling there. It won the 2018 Eisner Award for Best Reality-Based Work, making Walden one of the youngest Eisner Award winners ever at 22.
Walden's "On a Sunbeam", a science fiction webcomic, was nominated for the 2017 Eisner Award for Best Digital Comic. The webcomic was adapted into a graphic novel that was released in October 2018 by First Second Books, with the UK edition published by Avery Hill Publishing. Set in space, the story revolves around a crew in charge of rebuilding structures, which allows them to acknowledge the past. As Mia, the newest member, gets to know her team, a flashback occurs where she fell in love with another student named Grace. As time progresses and bonds are formed, Mia inevitably opens up about her reasoning for joining their ship - to find the love she lost. This piece is Walden's first take on science fiction. The graphic novel won the 2018 Los Angeles Times Book Prize.
To commemorate International Women's Day, Walden's piece "Minutes" was featured as a Google Doodle on March 8, 2018.
In 2019, Walden published "Are You Listening?" from First Second Books, which earned her the 2020 Eisner Award for Best Graphic Album-New.
In 2021, Walden announced her next graphic novel Clementine to be released in June 2022. The comic will follows the continuation of Clementine after the events of the game.
Personal life.
Walden has known she was a lesbian since she was 5. Before she came out, Walden avoided including queer characters in her stories, feeling that she "couldn't draw openly gay characters if [she] was still scared to be openly gay".
Walden spoke of her father's influence on her entrance into the comics industry. As said in an interview, "My dad has been the behind-the-scenes guy for my entire comics career. I realized that when I start looking, he’s been everywhere."
Walden is a graduate of the Center for Cartoon Studies. She also works as a professor there.

Richard Henry Jelf

Richard Henry Jelf (2 February 1844 – 26 April 1913) was a British army officer and commandant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich.
Early life.
Jelf was born in Oxford, the third and youngest son of the Reverend Doctor Richard William Jelf (1798-1871), Principal of King's College, London, and canon of Christ Church, Oxford. His older brothers were George Edward Jelf, later canon of Rochester, and lawyer Sir Arthur Richard Jelf.
He was educated at Eton College and King's College, London, before entering the Royal Military Academy in Woolwich.
Military career.
Jelf entered the Royal Engineers in 1865. He was promoted to Captain in 1878, to Major and Lieutenant-Colonel in 1885, and Colonel in 1889.
He saw service on the Bechuanaland Expedition (1884-1885), as Director of Military Telegraphs (and was honourably mentioned, Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel). He was later chairman of Sanitary Commissioners, Gibraltar (1893-1897; for which he was invested as a Companion of St Michael and St George). He commanded the Royal Engineers, Eastern District, from 1897 to 1901.
He retired in 1901 but was recalled to employment as temporary Major-General in the same year, becoming Governor and Commandant of the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, a post he retained until 1912. While Commandant, he commissioned the Academy's chapel in 1902, an act for which he is commemorated by a brass plaque in the chapel.
He was also a spokesman for the Church of England Soldiers' Institutes Association, and wrote a 1910 biography of his friend Joseph James Curling, a soldier and priest who had also joined the Royal Engineers in 1865. In 1882, Jelf commissioned a bell for St Mary's church in Newfoundland's Bay of Islands, where Curling was priest.
Family.
Jelf lived at Ashbourne, Derbyshire, where, in May 1911, he was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant.
With his wife Margaret ("nee" Blunt, 1839-1921), whom he married on 10 August 1869, he had at least three sons. Wilfrid Jelf and Henry Jelf were both first-class cricketers and military officers. A third son, Richard John Jelf, joined the Royal Engineers and after being invalided home from South Africa shot himself and was buried at sea in June 1900 - a plaque commemorating him and his parents is displayed in Ashbourne's St Oswald's Church.

Foutanga Babani Sissoko

Foutanga Babani Sissoko died in March 2021 is a Malian swindler, entrepreneur, and politician. Sissoko was a member of the National Assembly between 2002 and 2014.
He was born in the village of Dabia, to the west of Mali's capital, Bamako. Little is known of Sissoko's early life. 
He was said to have swindled the Dubai Islamic Bank for US$242 million using claims he could perform black magic, a claim he denies saying he only went into the bank to receive a car loan. He could do it with the help of the bank manager, Mohammed Ayoub. From 1995 to 1998, Ayoub made 183 transfers into Sissoko's accounts around the world. With the money obtained from the bank, Sissoko could fulfill "his dream of opening an airline for West Africa". A used Hawker-Siddeley 125 and a pair of old Boeing 727s were the first airplanes he bought. In this way he founded Air Dabia, named after his native village.
In 1996, Sissoko was arrested for trying to buy two Huey helicopters for Gambia. Because they could "be refitted as gunships", it was necessary to obtain a special export licence. Sissoko's men tried to circumvent this and offered a $30,000 bribe to a customs officer. They were arrested and Interpol issued a warrant for Sissoko's arrest too. Sissoko was arrested in Geneva, where he tried to open a new bank account. Sissoko was quickly extradited to the US, where he mobilised influential supporters. Among his defence team was the former US Senator Birch Bayh. The US government wanted "Sissoko held in custody, but he was bailed" for US$20 million. He was prosecuted for paying an illegal gratuity and served 43 days in jail and paid a $250,000 fine.
After serving only half this sentence, he was given "early release in return for a $1 million payment to a homeless shelter," to serve the rest of his sentence under the house arrest in Mali. At this time Ayoub confessed taking money from the Dubai bank; he was arrested and sentenced to three years for fraud in jail. From 2002 to 2014 Sissoko was a member of Parliament in Mali which gave him immunity from prosecution. It is also alleged that he was ordered to undergo an exorcism to "cure him of black magic".
In the late 1990s, Sissoko made plans to construct a large hotel in Bamako, on the north bank of the Niger River. The structure was never finished, however, owing to Sissoko's financial and legal woes; the site was purchased by Libyan investors in 2007 and renamed the Afriqiyah Hotel. Following the downfall of Libyan leader Mu'amar al-Kadafi in 2011, construction was again halted. The site was subsequently purchased by Moroccan investors, but as of 2019 it remained unfinished.

At the time of opening, the museum had only 98 exhibits, but there are more than 19,000 exhibits at the moment. The new two-storey building of the museum was put into use in 2008 which has 3 main halls displaying the exposition on Azerbaijani literature in chronological sequence.
The collection of the museum includes valuable manuscripts, applied and fine art samples, ancient and contemporary books (including autographs), newspapers and magazines, items reflecting the history of Azerbaijan literature and other museum materials. The exposition is of great interest to well-known representatives of classical and modern Azerbaijan literature, poets, writers and literary scholars of Nakhchivan such as Jalil Mammadguluzadeh, Huseyn Javid, Aziz Sharif, Mammadjafar Jafarov, Abbas Zamanov, Latif Huseynzade, Isa Habibbayli, Mammad Araz and Islam Safarli. There are works of Azerbaijani brush masters and sculptors in the exposition and fund, documents about the history of Nakhchivan theater: posters, programs, sketches of representations, photographs reflecting the works of famous masters of the theater.
Jalilkend branch.
The museum located in Jalilkend village of Sharur, Nakhchivan where Jalil Mammadguluzade used to work as a teacher was established in 1987. The branch has been operating as a separate museum since 2013 based on the decision dated 15.02.2013 of Cabinet of Ministers of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic. It was moved into the new building in 2015. The new building consists of an entry, an exhibition hall, fond room and 2 work rooms. There are 449 showpieces in the fond of the museum of which 274 are displayed in the main hall. The explosion includes the objects used by the writer, his works, documents, photographs and various issues of “Molla Nasraddin” periodical of which Jalil Mammadguluzade was the chief-editor, as well as books of different authors about Jalil Mammadguluzade.

ARIA Award for Best Indigenous Release

The ARIA Music Award for Best Indigenous Release was an award presented at the annual ARIA Music Awards. It was presented from 1987 through to 1998. Originally titled Best Indigenous Record in 1987. It was renamed Best Aboriginal/Islander Release in 1995. From 1996 it was Best Indigenous Release.
The award for Best Indigenous Release was first presented to Coloured Stone for their album "Human Love". It was retired after the 1998 awards with Archie Roach winning the final award for his album "Looking for Butter Boy". Roach won the award three times and Weddings Parties Anything, Yothu Yindi and Christine Anu each won it twice. In 1988 upon Midnight Oil's nomination for Best Indigenous Record, their manager Gary Morris objected to the group being put in that category by ARIA, "an Indigenous Award should go to an indigenous band."

White America, Inc.

White America, Inc., was an organization founded in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in February 1955. The organization was created following the desegregation of schools in Arkansas, to attempt to prevent "any attempts by Negroes to enter white schools" in the state. The group joined two other militant white supremacist organizations in September 1955 to attempt to intimidate the local school board of Hoxie to reverse its decision to integrate its schools.
The group's intimidating actions were so severe that a federal judge said they amounted to terrorism and placed an injunction on the organization and its affiliates to prevent them from contacting or otherwise interfering with the school board. This was the first time in U.S. history that a federal court had placed such an injunction on white supremacist intimidation. The group was affiliated with the White Citizens' Councils that existed throughout the United States during the Civil Rights Movement, as well as other state and regional segregationist organizations.
A year after its formation, White America, Inc., merged with the official White Citizens' Council chapter in Little Rock.
Background.
While the Civil Rights Movement was ongoing, several anti-integration groups founded to attempt to stop the racial desegregation and removals of discrimination which were beginning to occur. One such network of organizations was the White Citizens' Councils, which founded in 1954, after the landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling "Brown v. Board of Education", that same year, that stated state laws permitting white and black segregation were found to be unconstitutional. While the decision effectively overturned the "Plessy v. Ferguson" decision of 1896, which allowed states to segregate schools stating "separate educational facilities are inherently unequal", there was no true enforcement of this ruling in the south for many years. Blatant discrimination continued to take place for decades via Jim Crow laws, which had mandated racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, and continued to be enforced in many ways until 1965.
History.
White America, Inc., was founded by three white supremacist employees of the Cotton Belt Railroad in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in February 1955. They formed the organization to, in the words of one of the co-founders, "perpetuate the white race and to endeavor to have this and future generations free of contamination of Negro blood". The organization's main goal was to prevent or stop racial integration in the state's schools. The president of the group stated they were going to stop "any attempts by Negroes to enter white schools" and that they would do so "on a peaceable basis_through legal action", but warned if that failed that "the people" would "take matters into their own hands". The organization believed that the "Brown vs. Board of Education" ruling by the United States Supreme Court violated states' rights. The co-founder and organization president, L. D. Poynter, stated at a meeting in Pine Bluff that if integration happened "in a few years we won't be able to identify ourselves as white or black". The articles of incorporation of White America, Inc., entitled the executive office of the organization to the "Pine Bluff Labor Temple".
In February 1955 the group circulated a petition to request the state to place a referendum on the ballot to force the state government to "prevent integration". The petition garnered over 6,000 signatures and was submitted to state senator Lawrence Blackwell. In February 1956, a primary gubernatorial candidate (eventually elected as the 38th Governor of Arkansas), Orval Faubus, stated he held no objections to state employees signing the petition to have a pro-segregation measure placed on the ballot that November. The following month White America, Inc., commended Faubus for his statement; according to Amis Guthridge, the group's executive secretary, Faubus had "finally declared himself for the principles which White America stands for", but stopped short of endorsing him for the 1956 Arkansas gubernatorial election.
The organization worked with other white supremacist and anti-integration groups in the state, including the Hoxie Committee for Segregation and the White Citizen's Council of Arkansas.
Hoxie school integration dispute.
As in most areas in the Jim Crow south, Hoxie, Arkansas, had a segregated school system. This remained in place until June 11, 1955, after the "Brown v. Board of Education" ruling, the local school superintendent requested and received the unanimous support of the school board to integrate the entirety of the school system, including restrooms and cafeterias.
When local segregationists heard of the decision they converged in the summer of 1955 to attempt to intimidate the superintendent and school board to reverse the decision. They called for the removal of the local school board, and even threatened the life of the superintendent. To further intimidate the local community the groups began performing drive-by shootings of homes where black schoolchildren lived. Guthridge stated that school integration was a "plan that was founded in Moscow in 1924 to mongrelize the white race in America" and claimed that white Methodist women "want integration so that the Negro can get in the white bedroom".
In "Hoxie School District No. 46 of Lawrence Co., Ark. v. Brewer", 137 F. Supp. 364, the first time the federal government had ever intervened in a case of white supremacist's intimidation, U.S. federal judge Albert L. Reeves ruled that the actions by the anti-integration groups amounted to acts of terrorism, and ordered them to stop interfering with the Hoxie school board. White America, Inc., immediately appealed the injunction to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the ruling by the lower court. The Eighth Circuit ruling stated that the segregationists' conduct "was deliberately aimed at preventing the school board from affording to all the children within the school district the equal protection of the laws".
Assisted by the Hoxie Committee for Segregation, White America, Inc., began a campaign to enroll over 100,000 members statewide for $2 ($18.23 adjusted for inflation in 2018) a year. Guthridge, stated they intended to enlist over two thousand people in Lawrence County alone, after the Hoxie school integration dispute.
Merger.
In late 1956, after the group's unsuccessful segregation attempts in Hoxie, White America, Inc., merged with the Arkansas chapter of the White Citizens' Council.

Scribonius (Bosporan usurper)

Scribonius was a man of unknown origin, possibly Roman or Hellenistic. He claimed to be a descendant of Mithridates VI of Pontus, the earlier king of Pontus who had also ruled the Bosporus. Through this, he claimed the throne of the Bosporan Kingdom in 17 BC. The real king of the Bosporus, Asander starved himself because of this. He somehow convinced the wife of Asander, Dynamis to marry him. When Augustus learned of what Scribonius had done he sent Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa to remove Scribonius. Agrippa then sent Polemon I of Pontus to remove Scribonius and take the throne himself. Scribonius was executed in 16 BC, and Polemon took the throne. To legitimise his claim he married Dynamis.

Anor Londo

Anor Londo is a fictional city in the "Dark Souls" series of action role-playing games. Appearing in both "Dark Souls" and "Dark Souls III", it is the seat of the power of the gods, deities of the "Dark Souls" world who used the power of the First Flame to destroy the Everlasting Dragons that once controlled it. By the time of "Dark Souls", however, it has become an abandoned lost city, as Lord Gwyn had long since sacrificed himself to rekindle the fading First Flame. Anor Londo has been cited by critics for its design as well as the level's high difficulty, including a section guarded by two powerful archers, and the level's final boss duo, Ornstein and Smough.
Level content.
"Dark Souls".
The player character arrives in Anor Londo after completing Sen's Fortress. After dispatching the boss of the area, the Iron Golem, the player is carried over the otherwise sealed-off wall of Anor Londo by a pack of winged demons. As one of the only non-ruined areas of Lordran, Anor Londo stands in contrast to the other levels of the game. Following their arrival, the player must then travel to Gwyn's Keep to obtain the Lordvessel, passing many obstacles. This includes a duo of Silver Knight archers that guard the buttress leading to a side balcony entrance of the Keep. After fighting their way through the Keep itself, the player must face the level's dual bosses, Dragonslayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough, to gain access to Gwynevere, Princess of Sunlight. She awards the player the Lordvessel, allowing the player to warp away from the level.
"Dark Souls III".
When the player revisits Anor Londo, it is bathed in moonlight, frozen over, and has fallen to visible levels of decay. Pathways near the central elevator have crumbled, and force the player to explore a different side of the city. Additionally, a new path exists where a former bonfire once stood. The terrain of Lordran has also clearly shifted heavily over time, with large chunks of Anor Londo and its surrounding walls having vanished, and a new palace being visible in the distance. As the player progresses into Lord Gwyn's keep, parts are blocked off by collapse, and the entire location is waterlogged, full of debris, but decorated with new features such as cloth curtains. In the same room where Ornstein and Smough were formerly fought, the player must face Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, in order to obtain his power and return it to Firelink Shrine.
Plot.
Anor Londo was created by Gwyn, ruler of the gods, to consolidate his power after ushering in the Age of Fire. Many centuries later, upon the fading of the First Flame, he was forced to leave the city along with half of his Silver Knight army to rekindle the flame. At the time of "Dark Souls", the only remaining deity in Anor Londo is Gwyndolin, who presides over the Darkmoon covenant. He creates the illusion of sunlight, as well as Princess Gwynevere, to compel the Chosen Undead to defeat Gwyn and rekindle the First Flame yet again. If the player attacks Gwynevere, the illusion is shattered and the city reverts to its true appearance, shrouded in darkness.
By the time of "Dark Souls III", the city was repopulated and renamed Irithyll, until it became deserted again upon the onset of the Undead Curse. Gwyn's Keep is now an ancient ruin housing Aldrich, Devourer of Gods, a former human who mutated into an amorphous blob due to his cannibalism, and consumed the very body and soul of Gwyndolin, becoming a Lord of Cinder.
Development.
Anor Londo was designed to feel like a reward after completing Sen's Fortress, but also presented no clear path to the player, forcing them to take a number of side paths, like walking up the flying buttresses. The city's spiral staircases were meant to represent life.
The city's design was inspired by that of Milan Cathedral, which was visited in person by "Dark Souls" designer Masanori Waragai. The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, stated that he regretted the fact that the sense of excitement the player felt upon entry to Anor Londo was not continued for the level's entirety.
Reception.
"Edge" called Anor Londo "as beautiful as it is deadly" and "where "Dark Souls" casts off restraint". Comparing it to the "Divine Comedy", and the strata traversed by Dante in the poem, they equated Anor Londo with Heaven, and that it therefore "makes sense that it's the one area in the game you are incapable of reaching by your own agency". Calling the first glimpses of Anor Londo "dazzling", they state that since "Dark Souls" is "so bleak at times, so starved of warmth and light", the city's beauty "seems almost eye-shadingly pornographic". Kotaku cited the environmental storytelling of the city's design, where the obvious path forward is blocked, showing the player they do not belong there. Patrick Klepek of Kotaku called the appearance of Anor Londo in Dark Souls III a "highlight" of his playthrough and the city's architecture "beautiful" and "haunting".
Den of Geek called Anor Londo one of "gaming's greatest levels", saying that it "represents the core appeal of "Dark Souls"", by being designed to "intimidate and impress" the player, as well as being full of mysteries. Cian Maher of The Washington Post called Anor Londo one of the "eight wonders of the virtual world", calling the "gorgeously lit skyline" "striking" in comparison to the darkness of the rest of the game, and stating that "the people - or deities - who inhabit the city also contribute to its sublimity." Eurogamer called revisiting Anor Londo in "Dark Souls III" a "surreal, melancholy experience" that "ranks among "Dark Souls III"'s many high points", but also "shows how the series line has evolved, both technically and in its visual direction".
The Silver Knight archers of Anor Londo were criticized by "PC Gamer"'s Joe Donnelly as the moment he fell out of love with the game, saying that the game never felt unfair until that moment.
The entire city, including a dungeon and boss, was remade in "Minecraft".

Pulo di Altamura

Pulo di Altamura is a doline located on the Murge plateau (Apulia, Italy). It is the largest doline in that region and it is located about north-west of the city of Altamura. It shares the local toponym "pulo" with other large dolines of the region, i.e. "Pulicchio di Gravina", "Pulo di Molfetta" and "Pulicchio di Toritto".
Dimensions.
The perimeter, measured on the edge of the doline, is around . The larger diameter is abit bigger than and it is never lower than . The depth is around .
Etymology.
The etymology of toponym "pulo" is currently unknown. It is used only in the Murge plateau to denote a doline, while it is unused in other regions of Apulia. The term is also used for the nearby dolines Pulo di Molfetta, Pulicchio di Gravina and Pulicchio di Toritto ("pulicchio" means small "pulo"), and it is attested as early as in the 17th century, since Domenico Santoro in 1688 wrote "luogo detto dalli Cittadini lo Pulo" (place called by Altamura people 'Pulo').
Some geologists noted an assonance with the Slavonic term "polje" (which means "field" and which denotes karst forms consisting of large flat spaces) which, while denoting something different from "pulo", may have a common origin with this. Equally possible seems a Indo-European common root, from "*polŭ" ("open"). Nonetheless, it appears unlikely that there could be an affinity between the two terms, especially if it turns out that the toponym "polje" is relatively recent.
Scientific research.
Lorenzo Giustiniani, in his work "Dizionario geografico del Regno di Napoli" (1797), suggested that Pulo di Altamura may have originated from "underground fire" () and from earthquakes, thus hypothesizing a tectonic and volcanic genesis. 
Previously, a few other scientists and geologists had only cited a natural cavity near Altamura. Naturalist Giuseppe Maria Giovene (1784) noticed that, unlike Pulo di Molfetta, the caves of Pulo di Altamura did not contain saltpetre. Among others, Flores (1899) stated that he had heard about "a large doline located near Altamura". T. Vespasiani (1901) also cited the doline.
The first thorough scientific study on Pulo di Altamura (until then completely unknown among geologists and naturalists) was carried out by Carmelo Colamonico (1917), who first formulated a consistent scientific theory about the origin of the doline.
Origin and evolution.
A few hypotheses have been formulated about the origin of this doline, some of which are more plausible than others, but almost all of them are based on karst processes. Some pseudoscientific theories incorrectly trace the origin of the doline to a meteorite or to unspecified subsidence phenomena.
The origin of Pulo di Altamura, as well as that of the other dolines in Apulia pulicchio di Gravina, pulo di Molfetta, Gurio Lamanna, grave Tre Paduli) can be easily explained through karst processes, that is the double action (mechanical and chemical) of rainwater on the heavily fractured limestone rock of the Murge plateau.
Limeston rock itself is highly impermeable, but if heavily fractured, it exhibits high permeability, allowing rainwater to infiltrate, to physically erode the rock and also to chemically react with it.
That's why the region of Murge plateau is almost everywhere highly permeable. In this arid region, rivers and lakes are more rare, substituted by the so-called lama, very common in Murge. Lamas are furrows due to the erosion of rainwater and they are confused with rivers. In lamas, only a small fraction of the total amount of rainwater flows on top of it, while the remaining part infiltrates and flows underground as groundwater, following almost the same direction (horizontally) as the lama.
Pulo di Altamura is the lowest point of a vast rainwater drainage basin. The rainwater of the drainage basin reaches Pulo di Altamura through two main lamas, one in direction North North-East and the other in direction North-West.
Pulo di Altamura's drainage basin is so big, that it's been defined by Carmelo Colamonico "one of the largest absorption areas in Apulia". The amount of water flowing through the endpoint has formed, over the millennia, the doline, both eroding the rock mechanically and chemically dissolving it.
Moreover, Carmelo Colamonico, in 1917, first hypothesized that a pre-existing cave (acting as a sinkhole) may have collapsed, leading to the formation of the doline. In this case, the doline would fall into the category of the so-called "collapse dolines". Nevertheless, the geologic landform generated in this way would have been so small, that karst action would be necessary to explain the formation of the doline.
Human presence.
The northern side of the doline, almost vertical, has many crannies and natural caves, probably inhabited by hominids and prehistoric man. Altamura Man was discovered in an area very close to Pulo di Altamura.
Domenico Santoro, in his essay "Description of the city of Altamura" (1688), wrote that Saint William of Montevergine had lived as a hermit in one of the caves in the northern side of the doline, even though the primary sources of his statement are currently unknown.
Caves.
Pulo di Altamura contains three caves, i.e. "Grotta del colombo", "Grotta dell'imbroglio" and "Grotta dell'orco", located in its northern part. 
Flora and fauna.
Due to the particular shape of its walls and to the very particular microclimate along them and in the crannies of the doline, its habitat is ideal for many species (animals and plants), that are normally uncommon on the Murge plateau. For example, common raven is one of the species that nest on the steep and impervious walls of Pulo di Altamura.

Powered industrial truck

In legal terms of the United States, a powered industrial truck (PIT) is a specialized motor vehicle ( truck) defined in several standards: ANSI B56.1-1969 (PIT is a “mobile, power propelled truck used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier material.”), the OSHA 29 CFR 1910.178 “Powered Industrial Trucks” regulation and its standard interpretations depending on industry type: general industry, marine terminals, longshoring, and construction. OSHA defines PITs as "forklifts, tractors, platform lift trucks, motorized hand trucks, and other specialized industrial trucks powered by electric motors or internal combustion engines." The OSHA regulation specifically excludes "compressed air or nonflammable compressed gas-operated industrial trucks, nor to farm vehicles, nor to vehicles intended primarily for earth moving or over-the-road hauling". OSHA also says that its scope matches that of ANSI B56.1-1969 and some other ASME standards, including ASME B56.6. ASME B56.6 (Rough Terrain Forklift Trucks) excludes loaders with buckets replaced with forks. The June 27, 2011 OSHA interpretation further clarifies that the classification of a vehicle as a PIT is determined by its design rather than the usage.

<doc id="56647365" url="?curid=56647365" title="Major League Baseball Authentication Program">
Major League Baseball Authentication Program

The Major League Baseball Authentication Program, or MLB Authentication Program, is a program run by Major League Baseball Properties, the product licensing arm of Major League Baseball, to guarantee the authenticity of baseball merchandise and memorabilia. The centerpiece of the system is a tamper-resistant security tape (sticker) with an embedded hologram. Each sticker carries a unique alphanumeric code. The sticker is affixed to all game-used merchandise and memorabilia, while information about the item is entered into a computer database. Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season.
Background.
Major League Baseball started running an authentication program in 2001 after the FBI discovered during an investigation that 75 percent of autographs purported to be from MLB players and other personnel were fake. The organization has had a long-running issue with counterfeiting in general, which peaks during the postseason. For example, during the 2011 National League Championship Series between the St Louis Cardinals and the Milwaukee Brewers, MLB officials confiscated over 5,000 counterfeited items, with more than 80 percent being found in the vicinity of Busch Stadium. The largest haul is during the World Series, when thousands of knock-off jerseys, caps, bags, and other items of merchandise are seized. During the San Francisco Giants’ 2014 World Series race, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents seized over 2,700 pieces of counterfeit MLB merchandise in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Program description.
The authentication system centers on a hologram sticker by OpSec, which carries its own individual alphanumeric code. The sticker is tamper-resistant: the embedded hologram is ruined if the sticker is removed from the item.
MLB employs approximately 150 authenticators, with four being appointed to each team. An MLB authenticator will be present at every MLB game as well as the World Baseball Classic and team-specific events. MLB postseason games will have three or more authenticators. The authenticators all have a background in law enforcement and are recommended to the role by their local police departments. The authenticator usually sits in the first base camera well. Every ball that is taken out of play, without leaving the ballpark, is handed to the authenticator, who enters information about that ball into a computer database—such as "the pitcher, batter, inning and the reason the ball came out of play"—and then affixes the hologram. 
While anything that goes into the stands is generally considered outside their jurisdiction, if there is a batter's milestone occurring, the authenticators will often work with the umpires to mark up baseballs to ensure that even if the milestone ball is hit into the stands, it can be tracked and later authenticated.
Items authenticated.
Usually the MLB Authentication Program authenticates items used during baseball games, with baseballs and baseball bats being the most common. Other game-used items which are authenticated include "player jerseys, locker tags, lineup cards, the pitching rubber, home plate, broken bats", and base pads. Any player can request that any item be authenticated, with the request usually being passed to the authenticators by the relevant clubhouse manager.
Any item with an MLB association can be authenticated. One example of this was when the Baltimore Orioles authenticated the remains of a dugout telephone that was smashed by the Boston Red Sox's David Ortiz. They then presented the phone to Ortiz during his retirement season. After the Houston Astros' Game 7 win in the 2017 World Series at Dodger Stadium, MLB authenticated jars of dirt taken from the field.
Between 500,000 and 600,000 items are authenticated each season. Game-used memorabilia remains the property of each team, which authenticates items for players who have reached certain milestones, for sale to fans at the team store or on the MLB online store, and for sale to retailers and other marketers of authenticated MLB merchandise. Occasionally items are sent for inclusion in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.
In 2001 MLB Properties contracted with the Arthur Andersen accounting firm to oversee and authenticate private autographing sessions for balls, bats, base pads, and other items. The Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting firm took over this role in 2002.

A Gymnich meeting is an informal meeting of the foreign ministers of the member states of the European Union, organized according to the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union since 1974 (every six months). The ministers are not accompanied by their assistants, which makes the condition easier for informal and frank exchange of views. This type of meeting received its name from the first of such events held at Schloss Gymnich in Erftstadt, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Reception.
Reviews for the webcomic were positive. Andrew Liptak of The Verge said that the comic is fantastic and "has a ton of potential." Rowan Hisayo Buchanan of "The Atlantic" noted that the resistance to viewing profit as an "ultimate goal" goes beyond the story itself to the way it was made, with the whole comic still "online even after the book deal," meaning it is "simultaneously free and available for purchase."
When the comic was published in a graphic novel format, reviews were just as positive. Reviewers for New York Public Library and CBR praised the colorful illustration, mixing of science fiction and fantasy genres, and queer characters, especially the queer romance between Mia and Grace. Andrea Crow of Lambda Literary and Zora Gilbert of "Women Write About Comics" further called the story captivating and beautiful, praising the illustrations However, Crow specifically pointing to the focus on environmentalism and engagement with genderqueer identities, while Gilbert said the comic refuses to acknowledge the existence of masculinity, while crititicizing the comic for "homogeneity in body type." Others, like Stephanie Burt of "The New Yorker", Caitlin Rosberg of The A.V. Club, Josh Kramer of "The Comics Journal", praised the comic for being an optimistic, "queer coming-of-age story," world-building, imaginative setting, and storytelling. On the other hand, Lee Mandelo of Tor.com called the comic unremarkably queer, tender, and heartwarming, while Rowan Hisayo Buchanan of "'The Atlantic" described it as a "science-fiction universe of queer love, crumbling ruins, and magical forests." At the same time, NPR praised the comic for its "interwoven timelines and stunning art" and "Publishers Weekly" called it a "sprawling, wonderfully original space jaunt" and a mix of sci-fi mixed with adventure, road trip, and school drama.

Jenifer Hart

Jenifer Hart, née Jenifer Margaret Fischer Williams (31 January 1914 – 19 March 2005), was an English academic and senior civil servant. At one time she was accused of having been a spy for the Soviet Union, a claim which she always denied.
Biography.
Hart was the daughter of John Fischer Williams, a barrister, who for a time worked in France, where she obtained her early education. She later attended Downe House School. In 1932, she was admitted to Somerville College, Oxford, where she read History. Her mother was descended from the Dukes of Atholl and her sister was Judith Hubback.
In 1933, she joined the Communist Party of Great Britain. Three years later she joined the Civil Service after having achieved better marks in the examinations than any woman had previously done, it being unusual for a woman even to aspire to a career in the Civil Service. She became private secretary to the Permanent Under-secretary, Sir Alexander Maxwell. Although she admitted to having had a meeting with spymaster Arnold Deutsch early in her career, she claimed not to have been recruited or passed any confidential information to him or to other Communist Party members. In 1983, an edition of the BBC's "Timewatch" programme revealed that she had been interviewed in the 1960s by Peter Wright and others about her political activities, and this led to controversy since she was the wife of H. L. A. Hart, himself a former intelligence officer.
She married Herbert Hart in 1941, and resigned from the Civil Service in 1945 when he became a Fellow of New College, Oxford. She herself later became a research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, and eventually a Fellow of St Anne's College, Oxford, where she remained until 1981; she admitted her disappointment at not having become Principal. Her pupils included Rose Dugdale. Jenifer Hart was for a time a university representative on Oxford City Council. Her husband became Principal of Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1973.
The BBC revelations about her Communist associations led to an article in "The Sunday Times", referring to her as "a Russian spy". She and her husband threatened to sue the paper, which later printed an apology. Herbert Hart had a nervous breakdown shortly afterwards, which was attributed to the stress of the situation.
The Harts had four children, but Herbert admitted to having little interest in sex and suspected Jenifer of having affairs with other men, including Sir Isaiah Berlin. Their youngest son, Jacob, was brain-damaged at birth, but his mother formed a strong relationship with him. With her younger sister, Mariella, Jenifer Hart inherited her parents' home, Lamledra, in Cornwall, to which her parents had retired. Herbert Hart died in 1992, and Jenifer in 2005, at the age of 91.

Ivy (Peyton List) begins to investigate "Project M", which is being conducted at Wayne Enterprises and involves the experimentation and deaths of several plants, much to her anger. After she murders a Wayne Enterprises employee, a horrified Selina (Camren Bicondova) abandons her. Ivy then visits Bruce (David Mazouz) and, after hypnotizing him with a kiss, poisons him, causing him to hallucinate his closest friends and allies along with a mysterious cloaked figure, who reveals to Bruce that he is a manifestation of him formed by his grief and sorrow after his parents' deaths. Simultaneously, Ivy hypnotizes Fox (Chris Chalk) and forces him to take her to the laboratory where Project M is being conducted and she collects a sample of the Lazarus water that is being used in the experiments before escaping.
Gordon (Ben McKenzie) tracks them down and rescues Fox before collecting the antidote and rescuing Bruce, who believes that he has seen his future. Ivy also uses the Lazarus water to create a new flower that can immediately kill someone upon contact with the petals.

Gower Conservation Park (formerly the Gower National Parks Reserve) is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the locality of Tantanoola about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north west of the regional city of Mount Gambier.
The conservation park occupies land in section 517 of the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Hindmarsh. It was proclaimed as a national park on 21 January 1971 under the "National Parks Act 1966" and was given the name of "Gower National Parks Reserve". On 27 April 1972, it was renamed as the Gower Conservation Park upon the proclamation of the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" which repealed the former act along with other statutes concerned with conservation. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was considered to be significant because it was “an area representative of The eucalypt Forest (sic) which would once have covered much of the lower south east of South Australia.”
In 1990, the conservation park was described as having a landscape of “undulating consolidated calcarenite dunes are overlain by brown/grey, weakly-structured sandy soils” with “some limestone outcrops located in the central and southern parts (of the conservation park) in association with rough barked manna gum”. The vegetation cover was described as “mainly an open forest of messmate stringybark… and brown stringybark… with a shrub understorey of austral bracken… and a sparse shrub layer of spike wattle…, grass tree… and some silver leaved banksia… ” with “a stand of rough barked manna gum and some large black wattle… “ in southern end of the conservation park.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Trance (2020 film)

Trance is a 2020 Indian Malayalam language psychological thriller film directed and produced by Anwar Rasheed and written by Vincent Vadakkan. It features Fahadh Faasil in the lead role, while Dileesh Pothan, Nazriya Nazim, Gautham Menon, Chemban Vinod Jose, Soubin Shahir, and Vinayakan play supporting roles. The film was produced by Rasheed himself under the banner Anwar Rasheed Entertainments. Based on themes of substance dependence, religion, and the commercialization of spirituality, the film's plot follows the events in the life of Viju Prasad, played by Faasil, a Kanyakumari-based despondent motivational speaker, an atheist, who is hired by a corporate body to work as a Christian pastor.
"Trance" marks Rasheed's directorial after a hiatus of nearly eight-years, since his directorial "Ustad Hotel" (2012). Made on a budget of 35 crore, principal photography began in July 2017, and was completed on 1 September 2019. The film mainly shot across coastal Kanyakumari, and across Mumbai, India and Dubai. It was the first Malayalam film to use Bolt High-Speed Cinebot cameras and shot with sync sound. Newcomer Jackson Vijayan, composed the film's soundtrack album, with the title song being composed by Vinayakan TK; the background score was composed by Vijayan along with Sushin Shyam. The film's cinematography was handled by Amal Neerad, with editing done by Praveen Prabhakar.
The film's release was postponed multiple times, with the initial release scheduled to March 2019, owing to production delays, as well as censorship issues. A week before the film's release, it was leaked on the piracy website. "Trance" was released in Kerala on 20 February 2020, and across India on 28 February. The film opened to positive reviews from critics, praising Faasil's performance, the direction, writing and screenplay. The film was later released through digital platforms.
Plot.
Viju Prasad is a small-time motivational speaker living in Kanyakumari with his mentally unstable younger brother, Kunjan. When Kunjan commits suicide,Viju is devastated and relocates to Mumbai. There through a casting director named Kavitha whom he had once met at Kanyakumari, Viju meets businessmen Solomon Davis and Issac Thomas, who hire Viju to pose as a Christian pastor and perform hoax miracles. He is sent to Kochi where he is trained for his role by their associate Avarachan, who changes Viju's name to Joshua Carlton. Initially hesitant, Viju successfully transforms into the character of Joshua. He captures the devotion of many and help Solomon and Issac's enterprise grow into a global phenomenon.
At the height of his fame, Joshua is invited to an TV interview by a reporter named Matthews. On air, Matthews demands a live miracle. Joshua secretly drugs Matthews during a commercial break, causing him to collapse in front of the camera. The event is initially hailed as a miracle but a subsequent blood report proves that he was drugged. Furious at having put their enterprise in trouble and risk of public exposure, Solomon and Issac attack Joshua, leading him to be hospitalised with severe head injuries. He remains in coma for two days and they decide to quietly kill him to avoid any further trouble.
On the third day, Joshua starts moving about and shatters the glass by his bedside. He then goes into a psychedelic trance &amp; revives, making a miraculous recovery. He renegotiates his deal with Solomon and Issac to secure 80% of the profits for himself. Suspecting that Joshua is mentally ill, Solomon and Issac agree. They appoint a model and sex worker named Esther Lopez to observe him and determine whether his illness is an act. Esther herself has a past of being cheated in a relationship, giving birth to a child, falling into depression and then coming into the profession. Esther eventually grows close to Joshua and believes that he is really unstable. When she reports this to Solomon and Issac, she is immediately taken away. Avarachan tries to convince Joshua that Esther was a figment of his imagination.
Meanwhile, a poor man named Thomas who is an ardent follower of Joshua, tries to cure his young daughter's fever through his miracle cures. When she ultimately succumbs to her sickness, Joshua is devastated. He comes clean to Thomas and points him to Solomon and Isaac as the masterminds behind the scam. Joshua tries to publicise the truth by sending a confessional tape to Matthews. Matthews is killed on Solomon's orders but in his dying moments, manages to air the video. As it goes public, Avarachan suffers a fatal stroke. Thomas kills Solomon and Isaac to avenge his daughter's death.
Joshua is acquitted from his crimes due to his mental state and spends time at a rehabilitation centre. When he recovers, he learns that Esther is in fact a real person and sets out to Amsterdam to find her. He finds her in one of the glass cubicles in the Red light area in Amsterdam. They see each other, and as she runs to him, the film cuts to black to the sound of shattering glass.
Production.
Development.
In a March 2016 interview, Fahadh Faasil revealed that he would be acting in Anwar Rasheed's next directorial and its subject is fresh that has never been attempted in Malayalam cinema. "Trance" was officially announced with a title poster in June 2017. The film was produced by Rasheed himself. The film marks the debut of Vincent Vadakkan as screenwriter. Rasheed was earlier supposed to direct a short in "5 Sundarikal" (2013) based on the screenplay by Vadakkan. But it did not work out as he did not get the right cast. Later, Vadakkan narrated the story of "Trance", but then he was not ready to produce the film because of its high production cost. Rasheed had Fahadh in mind for the lead role then itself. Later, Fahadh happened to hear the story from Vadakkan and insisted Rasheed to reconsider the project. By then, the storyline had changed and bankability of Fahadh had also grown and Rasheed was confident in producing the film.
Filming.
Filming began in July 2017. A week-long first schedule of filming was completed in December 2017 in Mumbai. For the first time in Malayalam cinema, Bolt High Speed Cinebot cameras were used to shoot some scenes in the film. The film is shot with sync sound. The film was shot mainly in coastal Kanyakumari, across various locations in India and Dubai. In July 2019, it as reported that "Trance" is expected to cost close to ₹20 crore when it completes production. Amal Neerad was the cinematographer and Resul Pookutty was the film's sound designer. Filming was completed on 1 September 2019. The film was made on a budget of ₹35 crore.
Themes and influences.
The film deals with the themes of substance dependence, religion, and the commercialization of spirituality. In an interview with "The Hindu", Faasil said the film "is about dependency, be it on drugs, religion or emotions. Religion has become a business these days. [...] What we are trying to say in "Trance" is that humanity and compassion come above religion."
Vineeth Chacko of "The Deccan Herald" said the film depicted how "a struggle with depression, unmonitored ingestion of antidepressants and an illusory lifestyle can combine to tear away the seams between dreams and reality ... Viju has bought into his own hype and has come to believe on some level in his incredible miracles." The film studies the intersection between science and faith, dealing "with two kinds of drugs — the psychotropic sort (both legal and illegal) and religion/faith. If the first is being developed by scientists in laboratories, Trance shows us how religion too can be manufactured, not at temples or churches as one might think, but at five-star hotel lobbies (the lobby in the film looks like it’s the abode of Gods) with a “we-mean-business” attitude you'd associate with a startup pitch or a job interview." Writing for "Silverscreen India", Aswathy Gopalakrishnan said that the film showcased "the green room of the controversial faith-healing business that exploits gullible masses." Critics also noted allusions to godmen such as Osho and Benny Hinn.
Film critic Baradwaj Rangan observed that "Christian symbolism spills over from every frame", citing Joshua Carlton's initials, his third-day "resurrection" and the Holy Trinity of businessmen as examples. Characters in the film also drew parallels to biblical and mythological figures, such as Esther to Mary Magdelene, Solomon to his namesake, Matthews to Icarus, and Thomas to Abraham and later to the Grim Reaper.
Music.
The soundtrack album was composed and produced by Rex Vijayan's brother Jackson Vijayan, in his debut as a music composer. Vijayan also contributed to the film score along with Sushin Shyam. The album features a title track composed by Vinayakan TK. The album which was released under the Muzik 247 label on 15 January 2020, features six tracks along with the title track with lyrics written by Vinayak Sasikumar for most of the tracks, with Kamal Karthik and Blaaze providing additional lyrics. Actor Soubin Shahir, made his debut as a playback singer, rendering the track "Mathayichan" along with Sreenath Bhasi and Blaze. The track "Noolupoya" was served as the lead single which released on 3 January 2020. Sneha Khanwalkar, Pradeep Kumar, Varun Sunil, Neha S. Nair, Shakthisree Gopalan, Rex Vijayan amongst others contributed vocals for the soundtrack album.
Release.
The film's release was postponed multiple times. It was initially scheduled to be released on 22 March 2019. Then there were plans to release the film during Eid al-Fitr (5 June 2019), but was later shifted to Onam festival (11 September 2019) due to pending visual effects work. It was again scheduled to release on 20 December 2019, coinciding with the Christmas festival, before postponing to February 2020 due to delay in post-production work. Then it was scheduled to 14 February 2020 on Valentine's Day. But the regional Central Board of Film Certification in Thiruvananthapuram referred the film to a revising committee in Mumbai since Rasheed was not willing to cut a 17-minute long sequence that could hurt religious sentiments. On 15 February 2020, the film was leaked on the website Tamil Rockers a week ahead of its release. The film was released in Kerala on 20 February 2020. The film could not get much collection due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the mixed response among audiences.
 The film was made available through Amazon Prime Video on 1 April 2020. The film was dubbed in Telugu with same title and released on Aha.
It was screened at 51st International Film Festival of India in January 2021 in Indian Panorama section.
Reception.
Vineeth T. Chacko of "Deccan Herald" gave 4.5 in a scale of 5, entitled as "A thought-provoking daze" and said: ""Trance" is another such effort that is courageous, thought-provoking and encourages conversations about issues that matter to us on a personal level and speaks to society as a whole. An avant-garde achievement in filmmaking anchored by a sublime Fahadh". He applauds the film score, lighting and color palette. Goutham V. S. of "The Indian Express" rated 3.5 in 5 and said: "The abstract style of filmmaking, and the narrative structure that visualises the complex layers of the protagonist’s psycho is bound to make "Trance" a trendsetter in the Malayalam film industry ... Fahadh steals the limelight by portraying a character that is hysteric and disturbing at the same time". He also praised the "vivid visualisation, colour tones and the brilliant use of sounds" and cinematography and background score. Critic from "Sify" also rated 3.5 in 5, describing the film "bold and thrilling", writing ""Trance" is a genuine and brave attempt that is gripping from start to finish ... Anwar has packaged the movie deliciously, adding lots of emotions, in an honest way. With top notch visuals, music and sound the viewer is in for a grand experience ... But in a way, this film belongs to Fahadh Faasil, who is absolutely brilliant".
Prem Udayabhanu from "Malayala Manorama" gave 3.5 in 5, stating that "it is psychedelic and vibrant, flamboyant and gripping ... "Trance" is magical, hysterical and depressing and you need to transcend the mundane line of cinematic offerings to relish it". He praised the sound design, background score and cinematography. Rating 3.5 out of 5, Sajin Shrijith of "The New Indian Express" said: "If you are into films with a slightly eccentric touch, you may find yourself overwhelmed by the overall audio-visual experience ... Anwar Rasheed, cinematographer Amal Neerad, editor Praveen Prabhakar, and composers Sushin Shyam-Jackson Vijayan keep us hooked by delivering a film that feels part-dream, part-nightmare. However, post-interval, you begin to sense "Trance" losing some of the potency established in the first half".
Cris from "The News Minute" also gave 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote that "Fahadh delivers a great performance ... Anwar's filmmaking keeps you engaged the entire first half during which a captivating story begins to unfold. The last half does not keep up to the first, scenes that you enjoyed earlier becoming stretched, almost like you took a pill yourself and everything seems to take too long. But it doesn't let you down, with some excellent performances coming from a very promising cast". Sanjith Sidhardhan of "The Times of India" awarded 3.5 out of 5 stars and stated: "Fahadh as a subdued Viju and the flamboyant Joshua is the maniacal energy that drives the film ... Director Anwar gets the first half absolutely right in its pacing and content. However, the second half of the script, by Vincent Vadakkan, loses steam with the plot then almost reflecting Joshua's mindset in those scenes. The makers seem to have chosen style over substance in the latter half". He praised the cinematography and background score.
Rating 2.5 in 5, Nirmal Jovial from "The Week" wrote that ""Trance" is definitely a bold attempt for its theme, as far as Malayalam cinema is concerned. But it fails to do justice to the theme it explores with its weak script that becomes so cluttered and confused towards the third act", but praised the cinematography. S. R. Praveen of "The Hindu" called it "a half-baked attempt", stating "the first half of the film, which captures this transformation is gripping, owing much to Fahadh's performance, ... The film attains its high by the interval point, almost having the viewer in a trance ... Unfortunately, from there, the script goes downhill. One gets to see the writer taking the easy way out at crucial points, bumping off-key characters in a tame manner and depending on the usual television newsbreaks to untangle tricky situations". Critic Veeyen states that "‘Trance’ does address a theme that is radically important and proffers a compelling investigation into the unexplored realms of religion, faith and belief." But he adds that .."it's also a movie that eventually gets choked by the mistiness that pervades its plot and design, and ends up a pale shadow of the head turner flick that it should have been.
Remake.
Republic World published an article about a probable Hindi remake of the film with Rajkummar Rao, Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff and Sanjay Dutt playing the roles of Fahadh Faasil, Nazriya Nazim, Dileesh Pothan and Gautham Menon respectively.

Psycho (Post Malone song)

"Psycho" is a song recorded by American rapper and singer Post Malone, featuring vocals from American singer Ty Dolla Sign. It was released through Republic Records on February 23, 2018, as the third single from Malone's second studio album, "Beerbongs &amp; Bentleys" (2018). The artists co-wrote the song with Louis Bell, who co-produced it with Malone. Lyrically, the song discusses Malone's lifestyle and explores the theme of excessive fame and trust issues. The song entered at number two on the US "Billboard" Hot 100 behind Drake's "God's Plan", and reached number one in June 2018.
Release and promotion.
Malone first teased the song on January 4, 2017, with a video of him playing the song in a studio. Over a year later on February 21, 2018, he previewed the song on Twitter with a 30-second snippet, which highlights his verse. The accompanying artwork features a wolf and a bulldozer, the latter of which has the words "Posty Co." scribed on it. The song comes with its own merch line, featuring three different long sleeve T-shirts.
Composition.
According to "Billboard" and "Spin", the song has a slow-moving trap beat and melodically bears a resemblance to Post Malone's 2015 song "White Iverson".
Critical reception.
Sheldon Pearce of "Pitchfork" deemed the song a combination of "some of the least interesting raps you could possibly imagine" and "a downer that won't quit", writing that it "uses concepts that have been played out in hip-hop for years". Patrick Hosken of MTV News opined that the song "finds a late-night vibe that, away from the madness of crunching guitars, unfolds like a chill celebration of luxury". Mitch Findlay of HotNewHipHop wrote that it "continues the formula set by" Post Malone's previous single "Rockstar", and that they share "a few melodic similarities", describing "Psycho" as "more subdued" in comparison. The track was named the worst song of 2018 by "Time".
Music video.
The official music video for "Psycho" was released on March 22, 2018, on Post Malone's Vevo YouTube channel. It was directed by James DeFina. It features Malone riding on a FM103 Spartan armored personnel carrier, fighting a wolf with a flamethrower, and Malone with Sign amidst the wreckage of ruined aircraft. As of October 2020, the video has received more than 800 million views on YouTube.

Break Up in the End

"Break Up in the End" is a song written by Jon Nite, Chase McGill, and Jessie Jo Dillon, and recorded by American country music singer Cole Swindell. It was released in February 2018 as the lead single from his third album "All of It". The song features a lyric about following through on a relationship despite knowing that it will end in a breakup, and it is accompanied by a music video directed by Jay Martin which stars Swindell and actress Alicia Watson. The song has been noted for Swindell's vocal performance.
Content.
Jon Nite, Chase McGill, and Jessie Jo Dillon wrote the song. McGill recorded a demo of the song on a keyboard, and sent it via Dropbox to Nite, who added his own vocals and an acoustic guitar. Although the song had been pitched to Luke Bryan and Dan + Shay, it ended up being recorded by Swindell, who was unaware that Dillon, a songwriting partner of his, had co-written it. Swindell said that he chose to record the song because he identified with its central theme of a breakup: "You still think the world of each other; it's just not gonna work out. [This song is] a love story, in a way. Every little line describes a place that I've been at some point."
Dillon said that the title was inspired by the book "John Dies at the End", and decided to write a song about a man who feels bittersweet over a relationship, and follows through on it even though he is aware that they will "break up in the end". An article in "Billboard" compared the song's theme and lack of animosity in the protagonist's experience to Garth Brooks' "The Dance", Clint Black's "A Better Man", and Trisha Yearwood's "I Would've Loved You Anyway".
Swindell's recording of the song features an acoustic guitar accompaniment played by Billy Panda, along with muted percussion from Greg Morrow and piano chords from Michael Carter, who also produced the track. "Taste of Country" described the song's sound as " an acoustic guitar-based ballad that's very different from any other single Swindell has released. It's one of the most unguarded vocal performances he's ever given."
Commercial performance.
The song has sold 162,000 copies in the United States as of November 2018.
Music video.
The music video premiered on March 30, 2018. Directed by Jay Martin, it features Swindell and actress Alicia Watson progressing through a relationship that is filmed in reverse.

Johnston's Pier

Johnston's Pier was a pier, formerly situated at Collyer Quay, Singapore, where it stood from the mid-1850s to the mid-1930s.
History.
After the establishment of Singapore as a Strait Settlements port, many buildings along its southern shoreline were directly facing the sea. As business and commerce constantly developed along the waterfront, many merchants set up their businesses at Commercial Square with their godowns backed into the waterfront where they had their own jetties.
The idea of constructing a wooden jetty near the godowns of A. L. Johnston &amp; Co. was first mooted to the municipal committee on 26 March 1853 for the convenience of the commercial and shipping interests in Singapore.
After consulting the government surveyor, the municipal committee approved the construction of a stone ghaut on 20 July 1853 to be used as a public landing place instead of the wooden jetty as originally intended. In conjunction with the proposed ghaut, a stone embankment stretching from the proposed ghaut to Battery Road would be built.
Plans for a jetty known as Johnston's Pier was submitted to the municipal committee about 3 months later. On 19 October 1853, the municipal committee approved the construction of the jetty at an expenditure not exceeding S$3,000. A small house for a pier-keeper would also constructed at the inner end of the pier.
Launch.
The Engineer Captain Ronald MacPherson officially announced its completion to the Resident Councillor and Chairman of the municipal committee on 13 March 1856, the pier was named after a prominent Scottish businessman Alexander Laurie Johnston, one of the earliest European settlers who had arrived in Singapore in 1819 and established the first merchant firm A. L. Johnston &amp; Co. there in 1820. A male pier-keeper was hired at a salary of S$6 per month for the maintaining of the crane as well as lighting and cleaning of the lamps at the pier.
The wooden jetty was 40-feet wide and stretched 120-feet into the sea. The red lamps which were placed above the pier had led to many local Chinese of Hokkien origin to name the pier as ang teng beh tau (Chinese: 红灯码头, "meaning" “red lantern harbour”) and to the Malays as lampu merah ("meaning" “red lamp”).
Royal visits.
Johnston's Pier played host to many royal figures and dignitaries. The visits began in 1869, with the then Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Alfred Ernest Albert. Royal visits were met with great efforts in decoration of the jetty and many areas of the town. Mercantile businesses and private firms participated heavily in welcoming of the royal guests.
Closure and demolition.
By the 1920s, the pier could no longer handle the increased volume of traffic from docking ships. The pier had soon become dilapidated in the 1930s and the Governor of the Straits Settlements Sir Cecil Clementi approved plans to build a new pier to replace the former.
Johnston's Pier was closed and had its red lamps transferred to a new pier, Clifford Pier, named after Sir Hugh Clifford, which was opened 3 June 1933. Johnston's Pier's demolition worked started from 3 June 1933, and after much difficulties, it was completed by November 1935.
Naming controversy.
The decision to name the newly constructed pier after Sir Hugh Clifford sparked contention. The Straits Settlements Association of Singapore had several correspondences with the governor Sir Cecil Clementi appealing to retain the name of Johnston for the new pier. Persuasion failed due to the governor refusing to reverse his decision on grounds that Clifford's name was prominent in the region. Several members of the public also showed displeasure at the renaming, believing that the memory of Johnston's Pier would go along with its demolition. Despite the loss of the original name, locals continued to refer to the new pier in its Hokkien and Malay names.

Moran Caplat

Moran Victor Hingston Caplat, CBE (1 October 1916 - 19 June 2003) was an English opera manager, associated throughout his career with Glyndebourne Festival Opera.
Life and career.
Early years.
Caplat was born in Herne Bay, Kent, the only child of Armand Charles Victor Roger Caplat, a French-born architect, and his wife, Norah Bessie, "née" Hingston. He was educated locally. When he was fifteen he saw a touring production of "Twelfth Night" by the Ben Greet company which made him stage-struck, and in 1933 he was accepted as a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, London.
After graduation from the academy, Caplat acted in repertory companies at Margate and Croydon and toured with Matheson Lang. He appeared in a couple of films and acted in Stephen Spender's first play, "Trial of a Judge", at the Unity Theatre, London. His last position as an actor was with the local repertory company in Sevenoaks.
Caplat was a keen yachtsman, and with war approaching he joined the Royal Navy Volunteer Supplementary Reserve (known unofficially as the "Yachtsman's Reserve"). During the Second World War he had a distinguished naval career, ending it as a Lieutenant Commander. In 1943 he married Diana Downton. They had two daughters and two sons, one of whom predeceased his parents. Their daughter Simone married the historian David Sekers, son of the industrialist Nicholas Sekers.
After Caplat was released from the navy in 1945 a relative put him in touch with Glyndebourne Festival Opera, which was resuming productions after a wartime gap. The company needed an assistant to its manager, Rudolf Bing. The latter was impressed with Caplat, as were the proprietors of the company, John and Audrey Christie, and he took up post at Glyndebourne in October 1945.
Glyndebourne.
At that time Glyndebourne had close ties with the Edinburgh Festival, where its early post-war productions were premiered. Bing was a key figure of that festival, and in 1947 he was appointed its director. He remained Glyndebourne's general manager, but Caplat had day-to-day responsibility there. In 1949 Bing left Britain for the US, to run the Metropolitan Opera; Caplat was promoted to general manager of Glyndebourne.
He remained in the post until he retired, aged sixty-five, in 1981. During his tenure, Glyndebourne increased the length and scope of the festival from fourteen performances of two operas in 1950, to seventy performances of six operas in 1960. Christie retired in 1959, handing the running of the festival to his son George, whom Caplat guided in his early years in charge. Caplat also ensured continuity of Glyndebourne's traditions and standards, through the musical directorships of Fritz Busch, Vittorio Gui, John Pritchard and Bernard Haitink with successive directors of productions, Carl Ebert, Günther Rennert, John Cox and Peter Hall.
Caplat arranged overseas performances of Glyndebourne productions: "La Cenerentola" in Berlin (1954), "Falstaff" and "Le Comte Ory" in Paris (1958); "Don Giovanni" and "Il matrimonio segreto" in Sweden, Norway and Denmark (1967) and "L'Ormindo" in Munich (1969). When Glyndebourne productions were brought to the Proms, Caplat took charge of the semi-staging at the Albert Hall. Another key role was talent spotting. Caplat toured Europe looking for future stars, sometimes accompanied by one or more of the Christies, sometimes on his own. Among those appearing in Glyndebourne productions early in their careers were Sena Jurinac and Birgit Nilsson in 1951 and Luciano Pavarotti in 1964. Operas receiving their UK professional premieres in Caplat's time included "Idomeneo" (1951), "The Rake's Progress" (1953), "La voix humaine" (1960) and "Intermezzo" (1974). Caplat encouraged the conductor Raymond Leppard to revive neglected early operas, and Glyndebourne gave the first British productions of "L'incoronazione di Poppea" (1962) "L'Ormindo" (1967), "La Calisto" (1970) and "Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria" (1972).
Caplat was particularly interested in good stage design, hitherto a weakness at Glyndebourne. He brought in leading British designers, including Hugh Casson, Leslie Hurry, Osbert Lancaster, Oliver Messel and John Piper. Later designers during Caplat's tenure included John Bury, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, Erté and David Hockney.
In his sixties, Caplat began handing over responsibility to his deputy, Brian Dickie, who succeeded him in 1981. "The Financial Times" commented, "When Moran Caplat left Glyndebourne at 65 he was one of the longest-serving opera administrators in Europe. Moreover he handed over one of Europe's most successful houses."
Caplat died in Tunbridge Wells at the age of 86.

Miyagi Zao Fox Village

Miyagi Zao Fox Village, also known as Kitsune Mura, is a tourist attraction and not a sanctuary for foxes in Shiroishi, Miyagi, Japan where visitors can feed and interact with foxes. The village's main exhibit is an open area where foxes roam around and visitors can enter to interact with and feed them, although attempting to pet or hand-feed the foxes is not advised as they may bite. There are over 100 foxes, including typical red and arctic foxes, foxes with uncommon coat colors, such as silver and platinum foxes, and red-arctic fox hybrids. The village also has rabbits, miniature horses, goats, and guinea pigs, in addition to gift and snack shops. In the spring, events are hosted in which visitors can hug fox kits.
Criticism.
While the zoo has been dubbed the "Cutest place on Earth," it has also received criticism due to the high density of foxes, which are normally solitary or live in small groups, foxes kept in cages, frequent fox fights, a perceived lack of greenery, and allegedly poor sanitation.

Euonymus phellomanus

Euonymus phellomanus is a species of flowering plant in the family Celastraceae, native to China. It is one of several species within "Euonymus" called spindle or spindle tree. A substantial deciduous shrub growing to tall by broad, it produces insignificant yellow-green flowers in May followed by brilliant pink fruits in autumn. The fruits sometimes break open to reveal bright orange seeds. A notable feature is the rough corky bark which with age develops “wings” clothing the length of each branch. A similar effect is seen in the related "Euonymus alata". This feature gives rise to a name occasionally used, the corktree (or cork tree).
In cultivation this hardy plant is very adaptable, accepting moist or dry soil in full or partial sunshine. In the UK it has gained the Royal Horticultural Society’s Award of Garden Merit.

Edward Rooper

Edward Rooper (25 January 1818 Wick Hall, Furze Hill, Brighton - 11 or 15 November 1854 Inkerman, Crimea) was an English soldier, landscape painter, and botanical collector and illustrator.
He was the fourth son of the Rev. Thomas Richard Rooper (1782-1865) and Persis Standly (1783-1871), with siblings William Henry Rooper, Marianne Rooper, George Rooper, Henrietta Persis Rooper and John Rooper. He was the grandson of John Rooper of Berkhamsted Castle.
He received a commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade on 2 September 1834 and was promoted to Captain on 2 September 1842, and to brevet Major on 26 September 1854. He served in South Africa with the Rifle Brigade after landing at Algoa Bay on 20 November 1846 and was promptly posted to the Kei where he took part in the Seventh Xhosa War, mainly in the Amatola Mountains. At the end of hostilities he was appointed Resident Magistrate of East London on 1 January 1849, a post which he held until June 1850 when he returned to England with his regiment. During this period he had a chance encounter with the explorer and painter, Thomas Baines, inviting him to his headquarters at Fort Glamorgan to see his own paintings which included many botanical illustrations. These paintings came to light in 1956 and were purchased by the Botanical Research Institute of Pretoria as a result of efforts by its librarian, Mary Gunn, following a suggestion by Baines' biographer John Peter Richard Wallis.
On 30 March 1852 he landed once again at Algoa Bay and set off for the Amatolas to take part in the Eighth Xhosa War, returning to England on 12 November 1853. In July 1854 he sailed from England with his Regiment for the Crimea where they arrived 20 September 1854. From a camp near Beicos Bay, the fleet anchorage in the Bosphorus, he wrote a letter to his brother, George Rooper of Lincoln’s Inn:
Edward was wounded at the Battle of Inkerman on 5 November 1854 and died on 11 or 15 November aboard the troop transport ship "Golden Fleece" on its way to the hospital at Scutari.
On occasion Edward sent seed and bulbs from South Africa to his father in Brighton, who in turn forwarded interesting items to William Jackson Hooker at Kew and Thomas Moore at the Chelsea Botanic Garden. Consequently it is Rev. Thomas Richard Rooper who was commemorated in "Hypoxis rooperi" T.Moore, and "Kniphofia rooperi" (T.Moore) Lem. Memorials to both father and son are to be found on the north wall of St Andrews Church in Hove.

Southport State High School Buildings

Southport State High School Buildings is a ground of heritage-listed state high school buildings at Southport State High School at 75 Smith Street, Southport, Gold Coast City, Queensland, Australia. It is also known as Southport State High School. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016.
History.
Southport State High School (SHS) opened at its current 13.44ha (33.2ac) site on Smith Street, Gold Coast in 1955, separating from the Southport State School, which had included a secondary department (or 'high top') from 1916. Southport SHS demonstrates the growth in provision of secondary education across Queensland in the 1950s on new sites with increased facilities. The school retains two rare Hawksley prefabricated school buildings (Block B, 1955; Block E 1957–1958), covered walkways (1954-1961) that linked the 1950s buildings; retaining walls and railings; and assembly and sports areas; set within a generous landscaped site that exhibits organic site planning. The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment.
The township of Southport evolved after its survey as a marine resort on the Crown Reserve at Nerang Creek Heads in 1874. Its first allotments were sold in April 1875 and the first of its many boarding houses opened in the following year. The sale of 180 marine villa sites on 13 March 1878 further stimulated Southport's growth as a popular resort for Darling Downs pastoralists and the elite of Brisbane and Ipswich. From 1879 visitors could reach Southport via a daily Cobb &amp; Co coach from Brisbane and Ipswich, or via the steamer Iris from Brisbane to Southport twice weekly, or by the steamers Albert or Leonie. By the 1880s Southport had a permanent population of about 230, sufficient to justify the establishment of a primary school, which opened on 17 February 1880.
From 1860 the Queensland Government played an important role in the provision of schools in Queensland, providing an alternative to church schools and private schools. The provision of schools was linked to the location and development of communities, the number of children within reach of particular locations, community expectations, and changing government policies regarding the best way to provide for the education of Queensland children.
Southport continued to develop as a beachside holiday resort throughout the 1880s and 1890s, becoming Queensland's principal seaside resort. Its popularity with the colonial elite was boosted when Queensland Governor, Sir Anthony Musgrave (1883-8), established a holiday home there in 1884. Its popularity with all classes of Queenslanders multiplied after the opening of the railway extension to Southport from Beenleigh, in 1889, gave them easier access. By 1901, Southport's permanent population was 1230, which trebled in the peak holiday season.
In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering this to be of little relevance as Queensland's economy was based on the primary industries. The Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided scholarships for high-achieving students to attend elite grammar schools, although few were awarded. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". High tops were an economical measure that provided essentially the same education while utilising already established facilities.
By 1914, Southport's residents believed their town warranted a high school. On 21 April 1914, W Lather, the Secretary of the Southport State School Committee, requested that high school classes be established at Southport State School. In the following year, a deputation called on the Minister for Education and in 1915 a public meeting was held, which elected a committee for promoting the establishment of a high school at Southport. The District Inspector visited the area at the end of 1915 and recommended that a high school be established at the Southport State School. Following an entrance test held on 25 February 1916, 30 pupils were approved for admission to a "High School Top" at Southport State School. High School classes commenced on 10 July 1916 in rented premises, but classes were conducted at the school from the beginning of the following year.
During the interwar period, Southport grew into a large town renowned as a popular resort and a fashionable residential and educational centre. With its population approaching 2000, Southport was proclaimed a separate town from Albert Shire in 1918. By 1921 it had a permanent population of 3550 people, increasing to over 6000 residents in 1925. By the 1930s Southport had "many modern hotels, guest houses, flats ... water supply, septic sewerage systems and electric light".
After World War II, Southport continued to expand as Australia's beach culture developed and tourism to the South Coast boomed. In 1949 the Southport municipality amalgamated with that of Coolangatta municipality and the Burleigh Heads area excised from the Shire of Nerang to form the Town of South Coast, consisting of a coastal strip from Labrador to Coolangatta. As the commercial and administrative centre of the South Coast (renamed the Gold Coast from 1958), Southport experienced steady residential and economic growth in the 1950s, but the coastal area south of the town experienced massive growth. This development inevitably led to a demand for state schools in the region.
The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nation-wide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the "baby boom". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. The overriding concern for the Department of Public Instruction was the need to build school buildings as expeditiously and economically as possible because the Queensland Government regarded education as a low priority and provided the department with only a small budget.
The need for an adequate high school at Southport, to serve the whole South Coast, became a priority in the 1950s. In September 1953 there were 99 pupils attending the Secondary Department of the Southport State School. Of those, 62 resided outside Southport. As the school did not teach science subjects, students were unable to pursue any university study that required science as a prerequisite.
In response to this situation, the Minister for Public Instruction acted to provide adequate high school education on the South Coast. He approved the establishment of a sub-senior class at the Southport SHS from the beginning of 1955 and allocated £61,831 in the 1954-5 financial year for the erection of the new Southport State High School.
In Queensland, high schools remained few in number until after World War II, when secondary education became accepted as essential and was more widely provided. In the 1950s the number of high schools in Queensland increased significantly. The grounds were large, greater than 12 acres (4.8ha) providing ample room for sports facilities. The general classroom buildings were the same standard types as used for primary schools but high schools also included purpose-built science laboratories, domestic science buildings, workshops for woodwork and metal work, libraries, and gymnasiums. These were also built to standard plans but were specific to their use and not a continuation of previous designs. This reflected educationalists' rejection of the previous designs of school buildings, considering them outdated and their favouring of "lighter, loosely grouped, flexible" buildings.
There was also a focus on the fit between the school and its neighbourhood, as well as site planning for expansion. In the early 1950s, architects developed master planning concepts that influenced the design and layout of the whole school. Initially, these plans were broadly based on regular and symmetrical plan forms around a central or prominent axis. A few years later there was a shift away from grid-like layouts to organic layouts which provided for growth and change. Classroom wings were connected to and fanned away from a central nucleus. Master planning schemes were focussed on the ideal solar orientation of buildings as well as their relationship to the natural contours and existing vegetation, resulting in building layouts that were more asymmetrical and open. The long, narrow buildings were positioned so that the spaces captured between them created playground areas and courtyards.
Plans for a new Southport State High School, drawn by the Department of Public Works (DPW) and approved in October 1954, demonstrate an organic planning approach, with the buildings orientated at various angles and connected by covered ways. Positioned in the elevated southwest corner of the new 9.6ha (23.7ac) site, which was bounded by Smith Street (south), Brooke Avenue (west), Townson Avenue (north, now Lionel Avenue), Loders Creek (northeast) and Worendo Street (west, no longer extant), the buildings were "specially planned to suit the natural contours of the site and also make the most use of the prevailing breezes".
The site was cleared by November 1954 and tenders called for the transport of building materials from the railway to the school site. Construction commenced soon afterwards. The initial teaching buildings comprised three Hawksley prefabricated school buildings imported from Britain. All three (Blocks A, B and C) were erected by the end of July 1955 and teaching commenced there in late August 1955.
Hawksley prefabricated school buildings were prefabricated classrooms imported by the DPW from Hawksley Construction Co. of Gloucester, England, in response to materials shortages and the pressures of the baby boom. Across Australia, £1.5 million worth of Hawksley prefabricated buildings for schools, offices, hospitals and bungalows had been delivered by November 1951. Between 1952 and 1958, a total of 27 Hawksley prefabricated school buildings (90 classrooms) were imported by the DPW; initially intended to provide classroom accommodation at high schools and technical colleges, they were also erected at primary and infants schools across Queensland. Hawksley buildings were erected at Mount Isa State High School, Gladstone State High School, Cavendish Road State High School and Southport State High Schools; Ironside State School, Maryborough Central State School and Ithaca Creek State School; and Junction Park Infants State School, many of which have since been demolished.
The Hawksley system was prefabricated from aluminium structural systems and included aluminium external cladding and aluminium framed awning windows. Aluminium column sections were fixed to a reinforced concrete ring beam at floor level, and support framing was sometimes provided by rolled steel joists at centres and spans. The introduction of structural steel elements reduced the number of concrete piers required and provided more open area under the building. Many of the prefabricated components utilised techniques developed during World War II in aircraft manufacture, including pop-riveting and the use of synthetic gaskets and sealants. As a consequence, this system had an industrial aesthetic, unique in the evolution of Queensland school architecture.
Hawksley buildings could be high or low-set, had a verandah as circulation, and a gable roof. Ideally, they were oriented so the verandah faced north and the classroom faced south. The verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall had extensive areas of aluminium-framed awning windows, providing abundant natural ventilation and lighting. The classrooms were wide, larger than most previous classrooms. A range of building lengths and layout configurations comprising classrooms, storerooms, teachers and other rooms, all accessed via the verandah, were available and identified as alphabetised Hawksley "types". The buildings arrived in panel form, with the internal details prefabricated in the factory and components designed to be readily handled, to enable rapid assembly on site.
Masonry and concrete understoreys, and ancillary elements such as hat and bag racks, railings and stairs, were designed and installed by the DPW. Attempts were made by DPW architects, in the adaptation of these prefabricated buildings, to use "sympathetic materials and ... preserve the inherent lightness of the structure in the finished design".
At Southport SHS, Block A, used for domestic science teaching, was a Hawksley prefabricated school building "type B less 16ft" (). Lowset with a gable roof and a northern verandah, it had a large number of awning windows in its southern and northern walls.
Block B to the north of Block A, a Hawksley prefabricated school building "type H plus additional 40ft", was highset on a face brick substructure, with supporting concrete piers and metal posts, above a concrete plinth. The high school building had a gable roof, and was sheeted externally on the upper level with ribbed aluminium panels. The northern side had a verandah on both levels that had tubular steel balustrades, handrails, and supports, and enclosed hat and store rooms at the ends. The building contained four wide classrooms, a commercial room (west) and principal's office (east) on the upper level; with a science laboratory, store and lecture room (west), and lavatories (east) flanking an enclosed area for students' recreation space (temporary library and reading room) below.
Block C to the east of Block A, a lowset manual training building, was a Hawksley prefabricated school building "type A plus 8ft". This building had a gable roof, a west-facing verandah, and exterior walls and eaves clad with ribbed aluminium panels, awning windows and two louvred vents high in the gable end walls.
Covered ways connecting Blocks A, B and C were also constructed in 1954–5. These had concrete footings, steel round posts with struts at the ceiling, concrete paths, timber seating with steel frames, sheet ceilings and galvanised corrugated metal roof sheets and square profile guttering. The covered ways surrounded an assembly area to the immediate south of Block B.
In December 1955, soon after its commencement, the South Coast Bulletin newspaper commented on the modern new high school and the change of attitude towards secondary education that had preceded its establishment:Standing in 24 acres of grounds, the school consists of three blocks designed in accordance with modern standards of school architecture. Great changes were made in educational thought and practice... following two World Wars and the intervening depression. With a clear conception of the rights of the individual there came acceptance of the principle that secondary education is the birthright of every intelligent child and that his studies be closely related to his needs and aptitudes.Further funding, of £9406, was allocated to building at Southport SHS in the 1955-1956 financial year. Another Hawksley prefabricated school building (Block D) of unknown type, shown as a future administration block to the immediate east of Block A in the original school plan, was constructed on the site after December 1955. This was a lowset building with a small entry porch.
The Southport State High School, which provided secondary education for the whole of the South Coast, was officially opened on 26 October 1957, with the unveiling of a plaque in the vestibule of the Administration building, by the Minister for Education, Jack Pizzey. The flagpole proposed for the site in 1954 was on-site, located to the south of Block B, for the official opening day. In conjunction with the opening, student displays and demonstrations, an art exhibition and a fete were held, while the event closed with a passing out parade of the School Cadet Corps.
Growth of the school population continued and more buildings were added to the site. A fifth Hawksley prefabricated school building (Block E), shown on the original school plan as an intermediate school building situated to the east of Block B, was constructed in 1957–1958. This was a Hawksley "type F amended" building, highset on a face brick lower level with a concrete plinth. Unlike Block B, the upper level incorporated open-web metal trusses that reduced the requirement for supporting elements. It had a gable roof and was sheeted externally on the upper level with ribbed aluminium panels. The northern side had a verandah on both levels that had tubular steel balustrade, handrails and supports, and enclosed hat (western ends) rooms. The upper level contained three classrooms and a physics laboratory (east); with an enclosed student recreation area and toilets (east) below. The classrooms were wide. A pathway with concrete paving and retaining walls was constructed along the southern side of Block E, connecting with those that existed along the southern side of Block B; and a ground floor covered way, connecting Block E with existing covered ways to the south, was built at the same time. Alterations to Block B were also made - with balustrades at the upper verandah ends replaced by bag racks.
Further additions to the school were made in the early 1960s. Plans were drawn for the addition of Block F in 1960. This two-storey building with undercroft was supported by open-web steel trusses. Ribbed zinc anneal roof sheeting and wall cladding was used. The timber-framed building had brick ends that were designed to match the existing school buildings. Western verandahs were used at both levels and awning windows on all elevations. Block F was completed by May 1961. It was aligned roughly north–south and linked to the eastern end of Block E by an elevated covered way with open-web steel trusses, similar in design to a link that was also constructed between the first floor verandahs of Blocks B and E.
With the addition of Block F, a parade ground was formed to the southeast of Block E, providing a formal assembly space for the growing school. Other ground improvements at Southport SHS in the 1960s included tennis courts, at the northern end of the grounds by October 1960; and a school oval with perimeter plantings to the east of the school buildings by June 1964, to the immediate south of land that had been resumed in July 1961. Further resumptions (1974) and closure of Worendo Street (1975) brought the school grounds to a total of 13.44ha (33.2ac). Although more high schools were built on the Gold Coast as its permanent population continued to increase - Miami SHS (1963), Palm Beach-Currumbin SHS (1972), Keebra Park SHS in Southport (1973) and Merrimac SHS (1979) - Southport SHS continued to expand to meet secondary education needs in the region. By 1980, 14 teaching buildings plus an assembly hall and sporting facilities (tennis and basketball courts, sports oval) populated the site, radiating in an organic manner to the northeast and northwest from the original buildings. A principal's residence, onsite by 10 June 1964, stood in the northwest corner of the grounds.
Some changes to the surviving 1950s buildings have been made. Alterations to Block E were made in 1988-9 reconfiguring the upper level layout to three classrooms and converting the then science laboratories to general classrooms, and refurbishing the ground floor drama room (former student recreation area). In 2001 the lower level of Block E was reconfigured for a multi-media room. Changes to Block B in 2001 included creation of computer labs (former commercial room and classroom) on the upper level, new aluminium windows, and the replacement of two doors. In 2012 a concrete switchback ramp for disabled access was added in the NE corner of Block B. The brick walls and concrete plinths of the lower levels of both Blocks B and E have been painted.
By 2000, the school incorporated 16 teaching buildings, an assembly hall and sporting facilities including a swimming pool. The principal's residence was still onsite in the northwest corner of the site on Brooke Avenue.
Removal of buildings from the site took place in this century. By 2009 the principal's residence had been removed and in 2011 Blocks A, C and D were demolished; however, their associated 1950s covered walkways remain.
Of the few reasonably-intact Hawksley prefabricated school buildings identified in the Queensland Schools Heritage Conservation Study, 1996, only the two at Southport SHS and five at Mt Isa SHS (1953) are extant in 2016. Along with another Hawksley "type K plus six bays" at Maryborough Central State School, they are rare known surviving examples of the 27 original Hawksley prefabricated school buildings imported by the DPW, and the only known examples of types F and H in Queensland.
The importance of the school within the community has been acknowledged during anniversary celebrations. In 1991 Southport State High School celebrated its 75th anniversary with the production of a commemorative booklet entitled Southport State High School: celebrating 75 years, 1916–1991. For its 100th anniversary in 2016 the school held a centenary ball with alumni Clive Palmer as a guest speaker.
In 2016 Southport State High School continues to operate from its Smith Street site. Its school population is approximately 1600 students. The campus incorporates 20 buildings, plus sporting facilities. The school is important to the Gold Coast as a focus for the community and generations of students have been taught there.
On 4 October 2019, Block B was destroyed by a suspicious fire.
Description.
Southport State High School occupies a 13.44ha gently sloping site within a predominantly residential area of Southport. The main entrance addresses the major thoroughfare of Smith Street (south), and the school is bounded by Brooke Avenue (west), Lionel Avenue (north), and Loders Creek (north and east). The school retains two two-storey 1950s Hawksley prefabricated school buildings aligned approximately east–west (Block B, 1955, west; and Block E, 1957–8, east), located close to the elevated southwest corner of the site. Block B is orientated at a slight angle and is connected to Block E by a first floor covered walkway (). Ground floor covered walkways (1954–58) connect Blocks B and E with an area of vacant land to the immediate south, the former location of three lowset Hawksley buildings (Blocks A, C and D, demolished 2011).
A two-storey building, above an undercroft (Block F, 1961), aligned north–south and connected to the eastern end of Block E by an elevated covered way, contributes to the overall significance of the site planning by enclosing the eastern side of the parade ground.
Hawksley prefabricated school buildings.
Blocks B and E are long, two-storey, gable-roofed buildings, with north-facing verandahs on both levels. The lower levels are brick, set on concrete plinths, and the aluminium-framed upper levels are clad and lined in painted ribbed aluminium sheeting, including the eaves and first-floor verandah ceilings. The upper gable-ends are flat-sheeted and have square louvred vents.
Large areas of aluminium-framed awning windows line the first floor northern and southern walls; the northern with fixed lower sashes and tubular steel rails at sill height along the verandah. Ground floor windows comprise predominantly timber-framed awning windows on the southern side and double-hung sashes, with louvred glass fanlights, on the northern side; former louvres at the eastern ends have been replaced with modern fixed glazing. Windows generally have original hardware. Some windows have modern security screens or have been replaced with air-conditioning units. Doors along the verandahs are predominately flush-finish replacements, with fanlights on the ground floors and those on the first floors part-glazed.
Stairs on cantilevered concrete supports lead from the lower to the upper verandahs, which have tubular steel rail balustrades. The ends of the first floor balustrades have been replaced with bag racks that are clad externally in ribbed metal, and concrete-block bag racks have been added on the ground floor. The ground floor verandahs have paved concrete floors and flat-sheeted ceilings, with cover strips.
Block B.
Before being damaged beyond repair in a fire on 4 October 2019, Block B was a Hawksley "type H plus additional 40ft", and the upper level was supported by a combination of concrete piers and round metal posts.
The ground floor contained a staff room (former science laboratory) and classrooms (former science lecture room) at the western end; and toilet blocks and a store room (former locker rooms) at the eastern end. A large room in the centre (former student recreation area) had been partitioned to form a special education services area, connected to an adjacent quiet room (former locker room). The interior masonry walls were rendered and the flat-sheeted ceilings had cover strips.
The first floor contained five classrooms and a staff room (former temporary Principal's office), separated by fixed partitions; doors at the southern end connect the three eastern classrooms. The walls and ceilings were lined with flat aluminium sheets, with metal cover strips.
Block B retained some early framed, ledged glass-topped doors, with louvred fanlights, along the ground floor verandah. Wall returns at the eastern verandah ends indicated the locations of former hat rooms.
Block E.
Block E is a Hawksley "type F amended", and the upper level incorporates open-web metal trusses that reduce the requirement for supporting elements.
Some first floor windows at the western end of the southern wall are modern replacements.
The ground floor contains two large classrooms (former student recreation area and locker rooms) and toilets at the eastern end. The interior masonry walls are rendered and the ceilings are flat-sheeted, above the exposed open-web metal trusses. There is an enclosed kitchenette (former hat room) at the western end of the verandah.
The first floor contains two classrooms and a dance studio (formerly four classrooms) separated by fixed partitions. The interior walls and ceilings are lined with flat aluminium sheets, with metal cover strips, including one remaining early partition (western classroom) that retains its angled blackboard mount, with cupboards below.
Brick and Timber Building (Block F).
Block F is a long, two-storey brick and timber-framed building, above an undercroft, with the upper level incorporating open-web metal trusses, which are set on rectangular concrete columns and cantilevered to support a west-facing verandah. The northern and southern ends have full-height brick walls enclosing concrete stairwells. The ground floor is face brick (east) and rendered (west); and the first floor is clad in ribbed metal sheeting, with large banks of timber-framed awning windows, with modern sliding fanlights, on the eastern side. The undercroft has rectangular concrete piers and is open to the east.
The first floor verandah has a timber floor, square timber posts and bag racks that form a balustrade; the walls and raked ceiling are flat-sheeted, with cover strips, and the fixed timber-framed verandah windows have modern sliding fanlights. A central section of the first floor verandah has been enclosed with modern metal-framed sliding windows. The ground floor verandah has a concrete slab floor and ribbed aluminium sheet-lined ceiling.
The first floor contains five classrooms and a staff room; the central two classrooms have been extended with the removal of the former verandah wall. The classroom walls and ceilings are flat-sheeted, with rounded cover strips. The ground floor comprises toilets adjacent to the northern and southern stairs, separated from central offices by passageways that connect the ground floor verandah with stairs on the eastern side that access the undercroft. The open undercroft contains a tuckshop.
Covered Ways.
Elevated covered ways connecting the first floor verandahs of Blocks B and E, and Blocks E and F, comprise an exposed open-web floor truss system, timber framing and flooring, and tubular steel rail balustrades. The ceilings are flat-sheeted, with cover strips.
The ground floor covered ways have round metal posts with brackets at the flat-sheeted ceilings, corrugated metal-clad flat roofs, and paved concrete paths flanked by pairs of metal-framed timber bench seats. The square-profile guttering is modern.
Landscape Elements.
The school grounds are well established, with school buildings at the western end and sporting facilities including tennis and basketball courts to the north and a generously sized sports oval (pre-1964) at the eastern end of the site, with perimeter shade trees including various eucalypt species (spp. Eucalyptus).
The 1950s Hawksley prefabricated school buildings and covered ways are set back and visible from Smith Street, with an open lawn between. Concrete pathways, at the base of concrete retaining walls with tubular steel rails, run along the southern sides of Blocks B and E, and connect with the ground floor covered ways via concrete steps. Several mature eucalypts are situated at the western end of the buildings, near the corner of Smith Street and Brooke Avenue.
A sealed parade ground situated to the south of Block E, and bounded by Block F to the east and a modern administration building to the south, contains a flagpole and several modern memorial plaques.
Heritage listing.
Southport State High School Buildings was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 14 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Southport State High School (established in 1955) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of a standard school building that was an architectural response to prevailing government educational philosophies; set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities.
It is important in demonstrating the pattern of provision of secondary education, on new sites with expanded facilities, across Queensland in the 1950s, a time of enormous growth.
The two Hawksley prefabricated school buildings (1955 &amp; 1957–8) demonstrate the introduction and adoption of imported prefabricated systems by the Queensland Government in response to acute building material shortages and population growth in the post-World War II period.
The layout of these buildings (along with an adjacent brick and timber building with open-web steel floor trusses, 1961), the covered links between them (1954–61) and associated open spaces, reflect the mid-1950s introduction of organic master planning, which responded to the existing contours of the site and provided for ordered growth from a nucleus.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
Highly intact, the two Hawksley prefabricated school buildings are rare surviving examples of imported post-war aluminium-framed prefabricated school buildings and are the only known examples of Hawksley types F and H in Queensland.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Southport State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state high school of the 1950s. These include its master-planned site incorporating long, narrow buildings, linked around open-ended courtyard spaces; and generous, landscaped grounds with shade trees, assembly and sports areas.
The Hawksley prefabricated school buildings are excellent examples of their type and demonstrate variations of the standard layout configurations and support framing designs: Hawksley "type H plus additional 40ft" (1955), set on concrete piers and metal posts; and Hawksley "type F amended" (1957-8), incorporating open-web metal trusses. Highly intact, they retain their: prefabricated aluminium-framed and clad structures, mounted on brick bases; gabled roofs; verandahs for circulation; wide classrooms; and extensive banks of aluminium-framed awning windows to maximise natural light.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.
Southport State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Southport community. It was established in 1955 and generations of students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of the Gold Coast and as a focus for the community.

Niccolò Gaddi (1537–1591)

Niccolò Gaddi (12 October 1537, Florence - 14 June 1591, Florence) was an Italian nobleman and art collector
Life.
He was the son of Sinibaldo di Taddeo Gaddi and Lucrezia, daughter of Matteo Strozzi. The Gaddi family had occupied a major role in Florentine political life for a long while - Angelo and Taddeo Gaddi were members of the Signoria, Sinibaldo himself was made a senator in 1545 and Sinibaldo's brother Niccolò became a cardinal. They also acquired some important codices of Dante's works at the end of the 14th century. 
Around 1550 Gaddi was studying Latin and Hebrew under Francesco Vagnucci, who later dedicated his translation of the works of Giuseppe Ebreo to Gaddi. This humanist education was probably intended to prepare Gaddi for a career in the church, and at the age of fourteen he took minor orders. His cardinal uncle immediately granted him an income of 1000 scudi a year from the funds of the Diocese of Bologna and later also granted him other income-producing estates of the archdiocese of Cosenza and the Abbey of San Leonardo di Siponto in Apulia. In 1559 Gaddi had an illegitimate daughter named Lucrezia and around the same time he returned to the status of a layman, marrying Emilia, daughter of Lorenzo Ridolfi. Around 1552 he became a knight of the Order of St James of the Sword, then headed by Charles V as King of Spain.
After learning how to dress, think, and behave as a knight, Gaddi gave up banking and commerce, in effect becoming more like a , activity which raised him around 50,000 scudi a year, mostly from estates in land and public debt securities. He lived lavishly, keeping a great many servants and horses, exhibiting his collections of art and other objects in his palazzo on the Piazza Madonna degli Aldobrandini in Florence and adding a botanical garden to it. He also hired the Flemish botanist Joseph Goedenhuyze and introduced him to the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. After his first wife's death in 1563, Gaddi married again, this time to Maria, a daughter of Alfonso Strozzi.
In 1569 Cosimo de' Medici was granted the title of grand duke by the pope. That same year he sent Gaddi to Mantua and Ferrara to give their lords' news of this promotion and in 1570 he attended Cosimo's coronation in Rome. Between 1573 and 1590 Gaddi was one of those supervising the Stinche Prison in Florence, as well as sitting several times with the 'accoppiatori', those who prepared electoral lists for civil offices which were elected by lot. He was also made a grand-ducal senator on 12 November 1578. In 1575 he was an 'operaio' at Santa Maria del Fiore, in 1579 one of the nine 'conservatori del Dominio', in 1581 the supreme magistrate and in 1582 one of the eight 'guardia e balia'. 
1587 was a busy year for him, in which he acted as the health official, one of the reformers of the merchants' statutes and one of the lay reformers of nunneries. In 1588 he was one of the 'Conservatori di leggi', took part in converting the hospice linked to the monastery of San Paolo, Florence into a hospital for convalescents and was also given charge of planning the festivities for Christine of Lorraine's arrival in Florence to marry Ferdinand I. He set up a series of temporary triumphal arches adorned with sculptures and paintings along the path of the procession, commissioning G A Dosio to design them and A. Allori, D. Oresti (known as il Passignano) and G.B. Naldini to produce the paintings. He demanded that the paintings be in oils.
However, he is more notable as an art collector and advisor to the Medici art collections. For example, he negotiated their acquisition of "a marble portrait head of Homer, the Greek poet". He owned around 200 paintings by his death but unusually for his time he also appreciated the preparatory drawings and cartoons made for frescoes - by his death he had even acquired for himself the whole of Giorgio Vasari's "Libro de' Disegni". Between 1586 and 1590 he was put in charge of the Uffizi's painting collections, then mostly made up of Medici family portraits. He commissioned works from Giovan Battista Paggi, Naldini, Santi di Tito and Girolamo Macchietti, his favourite artists, who probably also produced works for Gaddi's own collection. He also collected (mostly ancient Roman) statues and vases and by his death owned nine sundials, 2700 medals in different metals, 1270 general books and manuscripts, 130 music books and manuscripts, around 40 musical instruments and a small collection of exotic curiosities, minerals, corals and shells. 
Gaddi made his will on 11 June 1591 and died three days later - he was buried in his family tomb in Santa Maria Novella. The will added his collection to the trust set up by his father and already including most of his father's goods - if the male Gaddi line died out, the trust was to go to descendants of his sister Maddalena, wife of Jacopo Pitti. However, only a few years after his death, the collection began to be dispersed, despite the best efforts of Vincenzo Gonzaga's wife Eleonora de' Medici - she had made an advance offer to buy the whole collection on 28 June 1591, only a fortnight after Gaddi's death, but this did not prove successful. What remained of Gaddi's library by the 1700s was bought by the grand dukes in 1755, followed by what was left of the artworks in 1774.

Deputy Chair of the NATO Military Committee

The Deputy Chair of the NATO Military Committee (DCMC) is the deputy head of the NATO Military Committee. Originally titled as the Deputy Chairman, the post was redesignated in 2021 to reflect the gender-neutrality of the post.
The current Deputy Chair of the NATO Military Committee is U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Scott A. Kindsvater, former Deputy Chief of Staff, Operations and Intelligence, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, Casteau, Belgium. He is the 22nd Deputy Chair and took office on September 30, 2019.
Role.
The DCMC assists the Chair, advises the Deputy Secretary General and serves as the principal agent for coordination of nuclear, biological, and chemical matters for the Military Committee. Finally, in the Chair's absence, the Deputy Chair directs the daily operations and business of the Military Committee, NATO's highest military authority. 
The Deputy Chair, always a US general or flag officer, provides a particular and ideal vantage point to serve the Alliance's Transatlantic bond. Having unique and relevant access to U.S. nuclear information coupled with an intimate relationship with NATO's 29 members offers distinctive opportunities to provide best military advice, especially pertaining to nuclear matters. While being a U.S. officer, the individual serves in an international capacity to represent the interests of the Alliance. 
History.
A Chairman position was initially established without a Deputy, but as the command structure evolved and the demands on the Chairman increased, the need for a Deputy became obvious. 
The Deputy's origins come from within the structure of the International Military Staff (IMS) as the 1963 Military Committee reforms provided the Director of the IMS a vice-director who held "special responsibilities for nuclear matters." This office was always an American to link the United States and NATO in nuclear strategy. Two dynamics served as the catalyst to establish the Deputy Chairman position on the Military Committee as it reflects today: 1. When the Chairman was away from Brussels, using a Military Representative within the Military Committee as a substitute proved unviable due to the conflict of simultaneously representing the interests of the Military Committee at large and one's own national interests and 2. the Military Committee did not want to create additional high-ranking officer positions to resolve the first issue. As a solution, the Military Committee elected to eliminate the Vice Director of the IMS position and simultaneously establish a new post of Deputy Chairman of the Military Committee. The Deputy position would still maintain the special responsibility for nuclear matters and remain a U.S. officer as established for the Vice-Director position. The NAC approved the proposal on January 6, 1967, to formally establish the position of Deputy Chairman of the Military Committee.
List.
Since the establishment of the Deputy Chairman position in 1967, there have been 9 from the Air Force, 5 from the Army, 4 from the Navy, and 2 from the Marine Corps. The deputy chairs have been:

Luke Smith (politician)

Luke Smith is an Australian politician who served as the Mayor of the City of Logan, the seventh largest local government area in Australia by population. From 2006 until 2016, he was the Divisional Councillor for Logan City Council's Division 6.
Elected as an independent in 2016, Smith ran as the Liberal National Party candidate for the Logan-based federal division of Rankin in 2010.
Corruption charges.
On 26 March 2018, Smith was arrested and charged by the Crime and Corruption Commission. The charges include two counts of perjury relating to testimony given to the Commission in 2017, one count of official corruption in his capacity as Mayor of the City of Logan, and one count of failing to properly update his register of interests. The corruption charges relate to Smith's relationship with a property developer who, in addition to donating to Smith's election campaign fund, allegedly provided an illegal contribution to progress the development approval of a Springwood hotel.
10 councillors attended a confidential meeting days after Smith's arrest, in which 8 out 10 agreed to formally ask him to stand aside. Acting Deputy Mayor Trevina Schwarz confirmed the "vast majority" of councillors decided to "make a formal request to the Mayor to stand aside for a period of three months pending the proceedings."
On 14 April 2019, Smith and 7 other Logan City councillors were charged with fraud by the Crime and Corruption Commission, which alleged they conspired together to terminate the employment of the council's chief executive officer following reports she was privately assisting a corruption investigation. She was formally terminated by council four months after giving information to the state corruption watchdog about alleged possible misconduct by Smith.
While on bail pending the resolution of corruption charges, on 1 May 2019 Smith was further charged with a number of offences including middle-range drink driving, driving without due care and attention, and breaching his bail conditions after an alleged motor vehicle accident. Police held Smith in custody following the alleged incident.

The Legend of Dugu

The Legend of Dugu () is a 2018 Chinese television series starring Hu Bingqing, Zhang Danfeng, Ady An, Jeremy Tsui and Li Yixiao. The series chronicles the life of the Dugu Sisters. It premiered on Tencent on February 21, 2018.
Synopsis.
During the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the Dugu family was the focus of world attention to the well-known "Dugu prophecy" given to Yuwen Tai that states the true king is not yet set and the Dugu family will be the key to ruling the world. The head of the Dugu family, Dugu Xin was concerned. Two of the Dugu sisters thought they would be the ones to fulfill the prophecy. 
The eldest sister Dugu Banruo is wise and ambitious. She loves the fierce general Yuwen Hu, but marries the weak Emperor Yuwen Yu to fulfill the prophecy. Banruo dies while giving birth to her son with Yuwen Yu. She previously had a daughter whom she entrusts to her sister, Dugu Jialuo. Her daughter is raised as Yang Lihua and marries Emperor Xuan. She and her daughter Lihua were both Empresses of Northern Zhou. 
The second daughter Dugu Mantuo is greedy and also ambitious. She yearns to become Empress too just like her older sister because of her low status. Mantuo refuses the advances of Yang Jian and wanted to instead wed her younger sister's fiancé. Unexpectedly, she ends up marrying the father of her sister's fiancé, Li Bing. Her son with Li Bing would later become Li Yuan, the founding Emperor of the Tang dynasty. Mantuo would be honored as Empress Yuanzhen after her death. 
The youngest daughter Dugu Jialuo is gentle and virtuous. She originally had feelings for Yuwen Yong, but their relationship doesn't last. She becomes the fiancée of Li Cheng, but their arrangement is broken off after Mantuo is married to Li Cheng's father. Jialuo marries Yang Jian and eventually falls in love with him. He swore to only love her, and they have several children together. Despite Jialuo's dislike for politics, they founded the Sui Dynasty together. She would become Empress Dugu of Sui.
All three marry into royalty, but each have a different destiny and fate. All of them end up becoming Empresses or Empress Dowagers of three different dynasties. In the end, the Dugu prophecy didn't only mean a person, but instead meant Dugu blood would rule the world.
Production.
The series was filmed at Hengdian World Studios from August to December 2016.

Archibald Donald

Archibald Donald (May 1860 in Edinburgh–17 April 1937 in Alderley Edge) was consulting gynaecological surgeon at Manchester Royal Infirmary and professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at the Victoria University of Manchester. Donald was notable for routinely sterilising catgut sutures and for a surgical repair technique for Uterine prolapse that later became known as the "Fothergills Repair" and later still became known as the Manchester operation 
Life.
Donald was the son of John Donald who was a Justice of the peace and Mary Donald née Smarte. Donald took his early education at the Craigmount School before matriculating at the Edinburgh College of Art and graduating in 1880. Donald then transferred to the University of Edinburgh Medical School and graduated with a M.B, C.M in 1883.
Donald was married to Maude Helen and between them had two daughters and four sons.
Career.
Once he completed his preclinical training, Donald started his residency at the Edinburgh Royal Maternity Hospital and Simpson Memorial Maternity Pavilion. After completing his yearly residency in 1884, Donald joined the Royal Navy and worked as a Naval surgeon while sailing to India. When Donald returned from India in 1885, he was appointed to a senior resident position at Saint Mary's Hospital, Manchester with the job title "Resident Obstetric Assistant Surgeon" and elected to the staff of the hospital in 1888, In 1895 Donald was appointed to his final surgical position as a gynaecological surgeon at the Manchester Royal Infirmary. For several years leading up to the end of the century, Donald lectured at Victoria University on clinical obstetrics and gynaecology. In 1912 he was promoted to the rank of professor in the chair of obstetrics and gynaecology at Manchester University. 
During World War I, Donald served with the rank of captain in the Royal Army Medical Corps that was attached to the 2nd Western General Hospital. He was subsequently made Deputy-Lieutenant of Lancashire. In 1920 he wrote his only book "Introduction to Midwifery" that was extremely popular amongst students and midwives, being produced in eight editions. In the same year he finally convinced the university to create a new chair in clinical obstetrics and gynaecology in which he occupied until 1925 when he became emeritus professor.
Surgical career.
Donald promoted gynaecological surgery as a stand-alone discipline for much of his career, although in his early years the evidence for a separate discipline was insufficient.
In 1888 Donald attempted five uterine prolapse operations. The procedure he developed became known as the Manchester repair and originally consisted of an anterior colporrhaphy, amputation of the cervix, followed by a posterior colpoperineorrhaphy. Donald executed the operation sometimes in two sittings.
Donald's student, William Edward Fothergill subsequently refined the operation by combining the two steps into one and including parametrial fixation. As Donald disliked writing about the operation, it was left to Fothergill to popularise it in his classic paper. It eventually became known as the "Fothergill's Repair" as it was popular among gyneacologist's. However over time as Donald's pioneering work was recognised, the operation became known as the "Manchester operation".

Da He ding

The Da He "ding or Da He "fangding () is an ancient Chinese bronze rectangular "ding" vessel from the late Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1046 BC). Unearthed in Tanheli, Ningxiang, Hunan in 1959, it is on display in the Hunan Museum. Uniquely decorated with a high-relief human face on each of its four sides, it is the only known ancient Chinese bronze cauldron to use human faces as decoration.
Description.
The Da He "ding" is named for the inscription in bronzeware script on its interior wall, which reads "Da He" (), or "Great Grain". Judging by the inscription, it may have been used during sacrifices for harvest. Although the Da He "ding" was discovered in the southern Yangtze region, its inscription closely resembles those found in the core Zhongyuan region of the Shang dynasty.
The "ding" is rectangular, with four legs, a common shape during the late Shang. It is high, and its opening measures by , which is slightly larger than its bottom.
The most unique feature of the vessel is that each of its four sides are decorated with a dominant human face in high-relief, which is not found in any other ancient Chinese bronzeware. Around the faces are small symbolic decorations of horns and claws, indicating a half-human, half-animal nature of the figures. There are many speculations regarding the identity of the figures, including ancient mythological figures such as Taotie, Zhurong, Chiyou, and the four-faced Yellow Emperor. They may also represent Nuo masks or local ancestral deities.
Discovery.
The Da He "ding" was unearthed in 1959 at Tanheli (now an archaeological park) in Huangcai Town, Ningxiang County, Hunan Province. A peasant digging in his field accidentally discovered the vessel and sold it as scrap metal. This was during the Great Leap Forward, when backyard furnaces were numerous in China. It was sorted and sent to a scrap copper warehouse in Changsha, the capital of Hunan. An employee from the Hunan Museum who was posted at the warehouse to rescue cultural relics, spotted a broken piece from the vessel. He searched the warehouse for the remaining parts, eventually locating more than ten pieces, only missing one leg and the bottom. The pieces were reassembled by Zhang Xinru (), a bronze repair expert at the Hunan Museum. The missing leg was also found two years later and put back on the vessel.

Copland v United Kingdom [2007] ECHR 253 is an ECHR case about UK labour law, English contract law case and health care in the UK.
Facts.
Lynette Copland was employed by Carmarthenshire College as personal assistant to the College Principal. The Deputy Principal had monitored her email. The Deputy then insinuated to other staff that she was in a personal relationship with another employee. The UK claimed the College could monitor Copland’s emails and use of the internet. The college’s statutory powers enabled it to do ‘anything necessary or expedient for the purposes of providing higher or further education’. ‘The applicant also believed that there had been detailed and comprehensive logging of the length of calls, the number of calls received and made and the telephone numbers of individuals calling her. She stated that on at least one occasion the DP became aware of the name of an individual with whom she had exchanged incoming and outgoing telephone calls.’ An internet ‘monitoring took the form of analysing the web sites visited, the times and dates of the visits to the web sites and their duration and that this monitoring took place from October to November 1999.’ She claimed this violated her right to private life and correspondence under ECHR article 8. 
Judgment.
The European Court of Human Rights held an implied right to monitor internet ‘unpersuasive’.

<doc id="56648111" url="?curid=56648111" title="FS Class E.333">
FS Class E.333

FS Class E.333 was a class of electric locomotives of the Ferrovie dello Stato (FS), powered by three-phase alternating current, which were in service from 1923 to 1968. They were designed by Kálmán Kandó for hauling fast passenger trains. Having the same electrical equipment as the FS Class E.552 locomotives, they presented the same defects and had to be modified. After modification, they were able to carry out the services for which they were designed.
Overview.
For service on the three-phase AC electrified lines in 1920, FS had locomotives of classes E.550, E.330, E.331 and E.332. All were based on electrical systems designed and patented by foreign companies. The FS Material and Traction Service, wishing to free itself of this burden, independently planned the classes E.551 and E.431. Kálmán Kandó (the designer of the E.550 and the E.330) had had to leave Italy during the First World War and was trying to regain his lost position through the company Ing Nicola Romeo di Saronno, who until then had only built steam locomotives. The first result of this collaboration was the new Class E.552, commissioned by the FS on 17 January 1920, which was intended to replace further orders for Class E.550.
While the E.552 locomotives were under construction, the company Romeo succeeded in obtaining a contract for 18 locomotives for the haulage of passenger trains on flat or moderately steep lines, which was agreed on 17 January 1922 with deliveries scheduled by May 1924. These were to be E.333.001-018. On 4 October 1922, another 22 units were ordered. These were to be E.333.019-028 and 029-040. The Romeo company, which was financially linked to the Mechanical and Naval Workshops of Naples through Credito Italiano, subcontracted to them the construction of the mechanical parts and the responsibility for the whole supply of E.333.029-040. 
The locomotives were divided into two subgroups:
The second group was distinguished externally by a higher cab other detail differences.
The E.333 was designed to haul both local and non-stop passenger trains of modest weight on moderately steep lines with a maximum speed of 75 km / h in both directions. This implied driving wheels similar to those of the E.330 and a traction system that developed the greatest tractive effort at the two highest speeds. Four speeds were provided and, with a power frequency of 16.7 Hz, these were 25, 37.5, 50 and 75 km / h.
Construction.
Mechanical part.
The mechanical part of the E.333 resembled that of the E.330, with a UIC wheel arrangement of 1'C1', large driving wheels and Zara bogies at each end. The adhesive weight was reduced from 51 tonnes to 45 tonnes to reduce axle load and allow use on many lines. The overall design of the machine resembled that of the E.552 and other projects developed by Kandó. These included a long section containing the traction motors with their auxiliaries in the centre, the rheostat at one end and the driver's cab at the other. This provision was advantageous for the accessibility of the equipment and for reduction of the accident risk for train drivers in the event of an explosion of the rheostat (which occurred several times on machines of various classes, with sometimes deadly consequences).
Electrical part.
The electrical part of the E.333 was substantially similar to that of the FS E.552 locomotives. The only notable differences were the presence of cooling fans for the traction motors and a smaller number of rheostat electrodes. The two traction motors were identical to those of the E.552, with an output of 800 kW at 75 km / h for each. Foreign patents were not completely eliminated. The stators were wound according to a Kandó patent and the rotors according to a patent by Ottó Titusz Bláthy, one of Kandó's colleagues at Ganz. As with all the locomotives designed by Kandó, the regulation of starting and the transition from one speed to the next was done by an automatically controlled liquid rheostat containing sodium carbonate solution. Four fixed speeds were available by switching between 12 and 8 poles on the motors and using cascade or parallel connections. The fixed speeds were: 
Modifications.
The E.333 had the same electrical equipment as the E.552 and reproduced its greatest defect - insufficient tractive effort when starting and at low speeds. Measured values were 96.8 kN at 25 km/h falling to 69.3 kN at 37.5 km/h. The Locomotive Studies Department of the Material and Traction Service of the FS, directed by the engineer Giuseppe Bianchi, proposed to the supplier the elimination of the second fixed speed and the modification of the motors and the rheostat. After some tests in 1926, a tractive effort of 176 kN at 25 km/h was achieved. The modifications were then applied to all the locomotives. As a result of these modifications, the fixed speeds were reduced to three, namely 25, 50 and 75 km/h, and good performance was delivered, especially at the two higher speeds. This made it possible to withdraw from the idea of radically altering or scrapping the whole class. The rheostat designed by Kandó had a pneumatic adjustment of the electrolyte level. Subsequently the FS technicians studied a new rheostat which allowed for exclusively mechanical regulation. This was first applied to the E.333 and later to classes E.432 and E.554 as well. 
The machines were delivered with electric steam generators for train heating but these were unsatisfactory. In the 1930s, thirty eight E.333 locomotives were equipped with a new type of boiler. This had been developed by FS in 1924 and applied, with subsequent modifications, to 184 locomotives of various classes. 
In 1933-1934 four E.333s stabled at Bolzano and Lecco were equipped with vigilance devices designed and built by Breda for one-man operation. These were also fitted to ten E.550s. This was followed by a device for automatically adjusting the train heating boiler. The vigilance devices were removed around 1945 because there was union pressure to restore two-man operation as a result of the post-war unemployment situation. After experiments carried out in 1958-1959 on some E.554s, locomotives E.333.025 and 033 were equipped with multiple unit control devices of the "Genova type" in 1960. However, they was rarely used. There were also some minor changes, such as modification of the inspection doors and moving the lights. In 1927, E333.006 was fitted with pantographs in place of the original Brown-Boveri type trolley poles. This modification was later applied to classes E.432, E.470 and E.472.
Statistics.
The E.333s were delivered between September 1923 and December 1924 and, having overcome the initial difficulties, proved to be remarkably efficient machines. First they were assigned to the depots at Alessandria, Genoa (Terralba) and Lecco. Statistics for the second half of the 1930s confirm the reliability of the class. For example E.333.010 of Lecco in 1937-1938 totalled an average of 5,609 km of travel per month and of 170,223 km between two major overhauls. In the year 1963-1964 the interval between two major overhauls was, for the whole class, 224,545 km.
Service.
In 1927 they were assigned to the Florence depot, to work on the Porrettana railway. They worked the Rome - Milan express trains and almost all the trains between Florence and Pistoia, hauling 440 tonnes at 75 km/h. From March 1934, some of them were transferred to the Bolzano depot for service on the Bolzano - Trento, Bolzano - Merano and Bolzano - Brennero lines. On these services they were able to haul trains of 480 tonnes (a dozen carriages) at 75 km/h.
From 1931, thanks to the electrification of the Savona - Ventimiglia line, they were used extensively on the Ligurian coast line, also hauling prestigious trains composed of Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits cars such as sections of the Milan - Cannes and Cannes - Sanremo services. The services on the Brenner line were also demanding, including the direct trains from Merano to Vienna, Munich and Berlin, or the Bolzano - Merano service with carriages continuing to Rotterdam.
Depot allocations.
This list is incomplete. 
Losses and withdrawals.
In 1943 E.333.023 of Bolzano depot was destroyed by bombing. It was then decided to remove many locomotives (including Classes E.432 and E.554) from Bolzano to a subsidiary traction centre in Bronzolo. In 1949, E.333.015 was derailed by a landslide at Malpasso on the Genoa - Ventimiglia line. It was withdrawn and scrapped in 1950.
The conversion of the Brenner, Ligurian and Piedmontese lines from three-phase alternating current to direct current, and the decision to keep in service only classes E.431, E.432 and E.554 led to a constant reduction in the number of E.333 units in service. By 1968, only seven E.333s remained. They were withdrawn and scrapped at Savona (Fornaci) and Verona (Santa Lucia).
Preservation.
E.333.026 was stored at the Novi Ligure depot (San Bovo) until 1992. It is now exhibited at the National Railway Museum of Pietrarsa.

The novel focuses on Richard Faraday, an actor who plays an extraterrestrial diplomat on a science fiction television series, who is kidnapped by aliens who believe him to be the diplomat he portrays. The novel was inspired by Jurasik's role as extraterrestrial ambassador Londo Mollari in the science fiction series "Babylon 5" (1993-1998).
Plot.
Richard Faraday is an actor on a science fiction television series, "Star Peace". He plays Harmon the Eldar, an extraterrestrial diplomat who is both kind and wise. An alien group of watchers, called the Kluj, who have been observing mankind through their television broadcasts for decades, do not understand the distinction between fact and fiction (in fact the concept of fiction might be a uniquely human concept), and kidnap Faraday as they believe him to be Harmon, and they are in need of his diplomatic services.
The Kluj need Faraday to solve a metaphilosophical crisis and avert a galactic war. While Faraday is trying to sort out the galactic crisis, a Kluj takes Faraday's place on the set of "Star Peace" and learns about the difference between fiction and reality, and how Hollywood works. This Kluj has to team up with Faraday to defeat the evil plans of one of the Elder Races wandering around the galaxy.
Development.
The lead character in the novel, Faraday, who is an actor on a science fiction television show where he plays an extraterrestrial diplomat, bears some similarity to author Jurasik, as Jurasik played extraterrestrial ambassador Londo Mollari in the science fiction series "Babylon 5" (1993–1998). The novel was completed during Jurasik's final year on "Babylon 5", and the cover illustration by Gary Ruddell bears a strong similarity to Jurasik's character. Co-author William H. Keith, Jr. is the writer of a number of science fiction novel series including the Warstrider series.
The book is similar in tone and story to "Galaxy Quest", which was released one year later. It also bears similarities to the 1995 science fiction/comedy television film "The Adventures of Captain Zoom in Outer Space", as well as John Scalzi’s "Redshirts" published in 2012.
Reception.
"Publishers Weekly" reviewed that novel calling it a "lightly entertaining story" that "moves briskly and includes fast action".

Joseph Goedenhuyze

Joseph Goedenhuyze or Goedenhuize (died late 1595) was a Flemish botanist and naturalist, active in the court of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was also known by the Italian name Giuseppe Casabona or more rarely Giuseppe Benincasa
Life.
He was born in Flanders, probably in the mid 16th century, but soon moved to Florence, probably as a teenager. His parentage and education are unknown but the latter does not seem to have extended much beyond that of a herbalist. Probably around 1570 he entered Niccolò Gaddi's service - Gaddi had built a major botanical garden in the grounds of his palazzo, to which Goedenhuyze brought back plants from Livorno, Monte Pisano and Barga. In 1578 or possibly earlier, Gaddi's influence at court gained Goedenhuyze a role in the court of Francesco I, as one of the gardeners in his Giardino Delle Stalle and Giardino dei Semplici and the garden at his casino di San Marco. He travelled widely to bring back new plants for the gardens, sending letters back to the grand dukes and to his scientist friends. In summer-autumn 1578 he went searching for plants in the Apuane Alps, getting as far as Liguria and Piedmont and between May and June 1579 he visited Grosseto, the Argentario, Piombino and the island of Elba, returning to the Apuane near Seravezza. In spring 1581 he collected plants in the territories of Padua, Bassano and Vicenza, finishing up at Trentino. In early summer 1583 he set off from Garfagnana, crossing the mountains around Parma and reaching the Euganean Hills and monte Summano near Vicenza - that August he visited the gardens in Padua and Venice.
In his final years Francesco I began to neglect his gardens in favour of his art collections and the sciences and Goedenhuyze suffered, complaining about his low salary and small purchase funds. He died in October 1587 and his successor Ferdinand I confirmed Goedenhuyze's post, increased his salary and assigned him a larger plot in Florence to plant his garden. Around this time Goedenhuyze made contact with botanists and scientists across Italy and Europe, such as Ulisse Aldrovandi, Gian Vincenzo Pinelli, Karl Clusius (director of the botanical gardens in Leiden) and Joachim Camerarius the Younger. Ferdinand recommended him Leonardo Valmarana, Count of Vicenza and to Girolamo Cappello, brother of the dowager grand-duchess Bianca. Thanks to this recommendation he returned to Padua in summer 1588 and from there began a long journey through the Republic of Venice's territories, including the monti Lessini, monte Summano, Rosà (where he was a guest of Capello's), Bassano, Cividale del Friuli, Fiera di Primiero and Agordo). The journey culminated in a climb of monte Baldo, though the local peasants thought Goedenhuyze was a necromancer and so count Agostino Giusti (godfather of the guardian of Verona) had to provide him with an armed escort. In the meantime some grand-ducal officials were trying to eject him from his lodgings at the Casino di San Marco and so he had to write back from Cividale to Florence to frustrate their plans.
In 1589 Goedenhuyze was elected chamberlain of the Compagnia di S. Barbara dei Fiamminghi in Florence and in October that year he travelled to Venice in an attempt to sail to Crete - the attempt failed but he still managed to use the trip study herbs in Verona and Mantua. As shown in a letter of Clusius, in April 1590 he was in Pisa to work in its old botanical garden, then headed by Lorenzo Mazzanga da Barga. In July and August that year he visited the mountains in Liguria as well as Munich and Nice and in late summer 1590 he made another attempt to visit Crete. He was unable to join Camerarius' nephew Joachim Jungermann on his voyage out, but on 17 September managed to embark on a galley commanded by Girolamo Cappello, who had been appointed governor of Crete. He explored the coasts of Istria, Dalmatia and Albania en route before finally landing at Candia on 22 November. Goedenhuyze explored the whole island for almost a year, collecting plants and commissioning drawings of some of them from Georg Dyckman, a German soldier in the Venetian army - thirty-five of Dyckman's images are now in the university library in Pisa, copies by Aldrovandi of seventeen more in the university library in Bologna. Goedenhuyze also wrote back to Ferdinand, Clusius, the duke of Mantua, Aldrovandi and Ferdinand's secretary Belisario Vinta.
Goedenhuyze returned to Venice in early November 1591 and went immediately from there to Florence, with major health concerns but also anxious to resume work on the gardens there, which had been looked after by his brother-in-law Giulio Marucelli in his absence. Goedenhuyze was appointed prefect of the Medici's botanical garden in Pisa and arrived there early in 1592, leading the transfer of plants from its old site at the Santa Maria convent to a new one on Via Santa Maria - the work took until at least 1595 and possibly longer. In autumn 1595 he travelled to Corsica but this final effort seems to have worn him out and he died late that year. His widow sold his small collection of minerals, animals and zoological and botanical drawings to the grand duke in February 1596. He was succeeded at the garden in Pisa by Francesco Malocchi, who continued to collaborate with Goedenhuyze's son Francesco.

David Hogg

David Miles Hogg (born April 12, 2000) is an American gun control activist. He rose to prominence during the 2018 United States gun violence protests as a student survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, helping lead several high-profile protests, marches, and boycotts, including the boycott of "The Ingraham Angle". He has also been a target and scapegoat of several conspiracy theories and right-wing accusations.
With his sister Lauren Hogg, he wrote "#NeverAgain: A New Generation Draws the Line", a book that made "The New York Times" bestseller list. They pledged to donate to charity all income from the book. As of September 2019, Hogg is a student at Harvard University.
Hogg was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018." He is the co-founder of Good Pillow, a pillow manufacturing company.
Early life and education.
Before attending Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, Hogg lived in Los Angeles, California. He is the son of Kevin Hogg, a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. His mother is Rebecca Boldrick, born in San Diego County, California and a teacher for Broward County Public Schools in Broward County, Florida.
Hogg chose to attend Stoneman Douglas because it offered television production classes. He is a Teenlink reporter for the "Sun Sentinel". He graduated on June 3, 2018. Hogg suffers from dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.
Hogg had been accepted to several universities, but decided to take a year off before starting college to work on the 2018 mid-term elections. In December 2018, he announced that he had been accepted by Harvard University and started in the fall of 2019. Hogg reportedly had a 1270 SAT score and 4.2 weighted GPA.
After Hogg's sister Lauren Hogg graduated from Stoneman Douglas in 2021, he and his family relocated to Washington, D.C.
Stoneman Douglas High School shooting.
On February 14, 2018, Hogg was a senior at Stoneman Douglas and on campus when a 19-year-old former student of the school entered Building 12 and started shooting with a semi-automatic rifle that coincided with the activation of the fire alarm. Hogg, who was in his AP environmental science class, told the teacher that the repeated "pop" sounds the class heard sounded like gunshots. Hogg and other students made an attempt to exit the building, but a janitor instructed the students to go back into the classroom. Hogg credits the janitor for saving them, as the group of students were inadvertently heading towards the shooter. A culinary arts teacher pulled Hogg and others inside her classroom and they hid in a closet.
Hogg checked social media and discovered that the shooting was occurring at his high school. He used his cell phone to record the scene in real time, to interview the other students hiding in the closet, and to leave a record in the event that they did not survive the shooting. Hogg's sister, Lauren Hogg, who was a freshman student at the time, corresponded with her brother via text message while the shooting was taking place. After about an hour, SWAT team police officers came into the classroom and escorted them out. Hogg reunited with his sister and father later that day.
Gun control advocacy.
Protests.
After the school shooting, Hogg emerged as a leader in the 2018 United States gun violence protests. Along with Alfonso Calderon, Sarah Chadwick, X González, Cameron Kasky and other students, he turned to the media to talk about their role as survivors in the shooting and voice his opinion on gun control and gun violence. He called on elected officials to pass gun control measures and has been a vocal critic of officials who take donations from the NRA, and he has been urging them to compromise on legislation to save lives.
Hogg joined the social media movement and student-led gun control advocacy group Never Again MSD shortly after its formation. Hogg flew to Los Angeles on February 21, 2018, to be on "The Dr. Phil Show", along with his sister, to discuss the shooting. There, they met with survivors of the Columbine High School massacre. Hogg, along with González, blamed the National Rifle Association and the politicians to which they donate as being complicit in school shootings. He declined to go to the White House on February 21 to meet with President Donald Trump, saying that he had to be in Tallahassee, and that Trump could come to Parkland if he wanted to talk.
Reactions by politicians.
When Republican candidate Leslie Gibson, who was running unopposed for the Maine House of Representatives, described González as a "skinhead lesbian", and also insulted Hogg as a "bald-faced liar", Hogg called for somebody to challenge the Republican; Eryn Gilchrist, who was "horrified and embarrassed" by Gibson's comment, decided to run as a Democrat to challenge Gibson for the position, as did Republican former State Senator Thomas Martin, Jr., who said Gibson's remarks did not represent the Maine Republican Party and that he planned to contact the survivors to commend their courage. Gibson dropped out of the race in response to public reaction critical of his comments.
Following the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol, David Hogg tweeted, "They can put up all the fencing around the capitol the real threats of @mtgreenee and @laurenboebert will still be inside until @GOPLeader takes a stand." Congresswoman Lauren Boebert (R-CO) retorted, “Give your keyboard a rest, child.” A video of Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) harassing Hogg in 2019 went viral in January 2021.
Recognition.
Hogg was featured on the cover of an April 2018 edition of "Time", along with fellow activists Alex Wind, Jaclyn Corin, González, and Kasky.
2nd Amendment views.
Hogg states that he is a supporter of the Second Amendment and supports NRA members' right to own guns legally, saying, "We're calling out the NRA a lot and 99.9 percent of the people that are in the NRA are responsible, safe gun owners and I respect them for that, joining an organization that wants to support safe gun ownership is excellent."
In an interview with Fox News, Hogg said he was for reasonable gun control such as regulations that prohibit those suffering from mental illnesses from acquiring guns. Asked what new legislation he wants to see, Hogg replied: "Raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to the age of 21; banning all bump stocks; making sure that we have universal background checks; making sure that people that have committed acts of domestic violence are no longer able to get a gun, which in Florida, it's harder, it's just not impossible, fully, yet; and making sure that people with a criminal history and a history of mental illness are not able to obtain these weapons of mass destruction."
Activism.
Hogg criticized the media coverage of the Parkland shooting as well as its aftermath in that black students were not given a voice by the media; he said that his school was 25% black but "the way we're covered doesn't reflect that".
In April 2018, Hogg initiated an effort to urge Speaker of the House Paul Ryan to bring a bill to the House of Representatives that required mandatory background checks for gun buyers; on Twitter, Hogg urged people to contact speaker Ryan and demand a vote on universal background checks.
Hogg worked to develop an anti-NRA advocacy group to encourage young people to register and vote in the 2018 midterm elections and elect candidates who promise better gun control legislation.
In May 2018, Hogg and other Never Again MSD students led a "die-in" protest at a Publix supermarket, with a mass of students lying down on the store's floor, as a rebuke of the supermarket's financial support of pro-NRA gubernatorial candidate Adam Putnam; the supermarket had contributed more than $670,000 to Putnam's campaign over three years. In addition, Hogg called on people to boycott Publix until the chain's support of Putnam stopped. As a result of the protest, Publix made a statement suspending support for Putnam.
In August 2018, Hogg announced he was planning on running to become a member of the United States House of Representatives when he turns 25 years old (due to ).
On February 10, 2021, March For Our Lives announced that Hogg would take a leave of absence "to take some time for himself to reflect and recommit to the mission."
Boycotts.
Hogg called for students to boycott spring break in Florida and instead travel to Puerto Rico if gun control legislation was not passed by the Florida state government. Having finished high school in May 2018, Hogg took a gap year to campaign for politicians in favor of gun reform in the midterm elections.
Hogg initiated a boycott of companies who advertise during "The Ingraham Angle". Hogg called for the boycott after television host Laura Ingraham attacked him in a tweet about his lack of college acceptances, which Hogg characterized as cyberbullying. In response to the boycott, 24 advertisers left the show. Following the loss of advertisers, Ingraham apologized. Hogg dismissed the apology as insincere. The boycott drew mixed reactions. Ingraham was supported by Ted Nugent, Bill Maher, and by Russian bots on Twitter. Fox News continued to support Ingraham. Public polling showed that public perception of Fox News declined more than that of any advertiser. Simultaneously, Ingraham's viewership increased in the weeks following the boycott. Before, her viewership averaged 2.5 million. It jumped to 3 million when she returned after the boycott.
Conspiracy theories and harassment.
Shortly after the shooting, false claims appeared on social media claiming that the event never happened, and others accused Hogg and other students of being "crisis actors". After a series of televised interviews following the shooting, far-right figures and conspiracy theorists attacked Hogg in online media. Hogg's family received death threats from various conspiracy theorists, according to David's mother. Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram reported removing posts that attack the students or accuse them of being actors. The conspiracy theories about Hogg and other Parkland activists were named "PolitiFact"'s 2018 Lie of the Year.
In April 2018, Hogg was threatened by a Sinclair Broadcast Group TV host Jamie Allman from station KDNL-TV in St. Louis, who wrote a tweet threatening to insert a hot poker in his anus. Following a boycott of advertisers initiated by Hogg on "The Allman Report", Allman resigned and his show was canceled.
On the morning of June 5, 2018, Broward County Sheriff's Office received a false report from an anonymous caller claiming that there was a hostage situation in Hogg's family home. The harassment tactic known as swatting was described by Hogg, several media organizations, and the sheriff's department as a prank.
During a June 2019 interview with the "Washington Post Magazine", Hogg said there have been seven attempts on his life.
Business venture.
In February 2021, Hogg announced that he and progressive tech entrepreneur William LeGate would start a company to compete with MyPillow, whose CEO Mike Lindell has spread unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud as a staunch supporter of former President Trump. Hogg announced the new venture in a series of tweets. The company name was later announced as Good Pillow. In early April 2021, Hogg announced in another series of tweets that he had resigned, released all his interest in the company to LeGate, and was leaving the venture.

Amanda Sandborg Waesterberg

Amanda Teresia Waesterberg (1842–1918) was a Swedish composer.
Amanda (née Sandborg) was born in Stockholm on 16 December 1842 as the daughter of Carl Sandborg (1793−1862), a cantor at Maria Magdalena Church and the Royal Swedish Opera, and his wife Frederica Cecilia (née Hagberg). At her baptism, Jacob Niclas Ahlström, conductor at the Royal Court of Sweden, was one of Amanda's godfathers. After having received her first music lessons at home together with her siblings, she enrolled in the class choir at the educational institution of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music. She was married to Lars Magnus Waesterberg, and became the mother-in-law of the industrialist Fredrik Ljungström.
From 1875, under the nom de plume "A S-g", Amanda Sandborg Waesterberg composed hundreds of works. She was also active in piano pedagogy. As a member of the Protestant free church in Sweden, many of her works were sacred songs. Half of the sacred ones were written for one or more voices with accompaniment. The remainder were in four-part harmonies for choir or for congregational singing.
Stylistically, Sandborg-Waesterberg was typical of mid-1800s song composition: a style that continued to be used in bourgeoisie salon music as well as within the "frikyrkan", even when it had lost its pertinence in coeval art music. [...] Since she was a pianist and accompanist herself, her piano parts are often quite elaborate and independent from the vocal parts. In some of her songs one can hear virtuosic figurations or onomatopoeic verse, interpretive of the chirping of birds in the coloratura-like ornamented vocal part. Several of her earlier songs relate to art music arrangements of folk tunes. She creates dramatic effects with the use of diminished chords. – Ph.D. Hans Bernskiöld (transl. Thalia Thunander), Swedish Musical Heritage, the Royal Swedish Academy of Music

Vimont Lake

The Vimont Lake is a freshwater body of the Lac-Ashuapmushuan, Quebec unorganized territory in the northwestern part of the Regional County Municipality (MRC) Le Domaine-du-Roy, in the administrative region of Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, in province of Quebec, in Canada. This lake extends almost entirely in the canton of Vimont, except the northern part Rinfret.
Forestry is the main economic activity of the sector. Recreational tourism activities come second.
A forest road serves the eastern part of the lake; road R0210 (North-South direction) serves the western part from the South where it connects to the forest road Route 167 connecting Chibougamau to Saint-Félicien, Quebec. The
Canadian National Railway runs along this road.
The surface of Vimont Lake is usually frozen from early November to mid-May, however, safe ice circulation is generally from mid-November to mid-April.
Toponymy.
This hydronym is linked to the name of the township of Vimont.
These place names evoke the work of life of the Jesuit priest Barthélemy Vimont (Lisieux, France, 1594 - Vannes, France, 1667). Coming to New France in 1629, he was first assigned as a chaplain to a garrison near Cape Breton in 1629, where he had to stop because of the sinking of Captain Charles Daniel's ship. In 1630 he was recalled to France because of the occupation of Quebec by the Kirke brothers. He returns to Quebec in the company of Jesuit fathers Pierre-Joseph-Marie Chaumonot and Joseph Antoine Poncet de la Rivière, of Marie Guyart said Marie de l'Incarnation and Marie-Madeleine Chauvigny de La Peltrie, August 1, 1639. Superior General of the Jesuits (1639-1645), the father Vimont attends the foundation of Montreal of Paul Chomedey de Maisonneuve which he describes in the 1642 relationship.
After a stay in France, from 1645 to 1648, he returned to Québec where he worked there his ministry, as well as in the surrounding parishes until 1659. He left New France for France where he died eight years later.,
The toponym "Lac Vimont" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec.

Bundaberg State High School

Bundaberg State High School is a heritage-listed state high school and technical college at 37 Maryborough Street, Bundaberg South, Bundaberg, Bundaberg Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1920 to 1956. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 June 2017.
History.
Bundaberg State High School (SHS) was established in 1912, and was opened on its current site on Maryborough Street in Bundaberg South in 1921 as Bundaberg State High School and Technical College. The school is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture. Bundaberg SHS retains the first two timber teaching buildings constructed on the site: a large variant of the suburban timber school building type (1920, Block D); and an early vocational building (1920, extended 1937 and 1956, Block G); plus two saw-tooth workshop buildings: Workshop No.1 (1956, Block R), and Workshop No.2 (1959, Block M). The school has been in continuous operation since its establishment, and Block D is the earliest surviving purpose-built state high school building of its type in Queensland.
The European presence in the Burnett River area, traditionally the land of the Kalki people, began with pastoralism in the 1840s and 1850s, while timber cutters arrived in the mid-1860s to work the coastal scrub. By the 1860s there were five pastoral stations on the lower Burnett River. Selection of land around Bundaberg began in 1867 under the "Sugar and Coffee Regulations" of the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1860, and the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1868 enabled the resumption of half of the Bingera and Branyan Runs in November 1869. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed the same year.
Bundaberg's development as a port and service centre was boosted by growing coastal traffic and by its designation as the port for Mount Perry's copper mining from 1881. Surrounded by sugar plantations and the site of two sugar refineries, Bundaberg became an important sugar town. The first South Sea Islander (SSI) indentured labour arrived in Bundaberg in 1879 and the sugar plantation system reached its peak in Queensland in the early 1880s. However, large sugar plantations with their own mills and a SSI workforce were eventually replaced by European small farmers supplying central sugar mills.
The development of Bundaberg was accompanied by the establishment of secondary education facilities. Bundaberg possessed a private high school for girls from February 1893, which became co-educational . In Queensland, governments were slow to establish state secondary education, considering this to be of little relevance to Queensland's economy which was based on primary industries. The Grammar Schools Act 1860 provided scholarships for high-achieving students to attend elite grammar schools. It was not until 1912 that the government instituted a high school system, whereby separate high schools were established in major towns or, where the student population was too small, a primary school was expanded to include a "high top". The first high schools were established within existing technical colleges, utilising their buildings. In Queensland generally, high schools remained few in number until after World War II (WWII).
Throughout the 19th century the only avenue for technical education in Queensland was the local School of Arts. During the 1880s several committees established separate technical colleges and initially these colleges were conducted within existing school of arts buildings. The first purpose-built technical college to open was the Ipswich Technical College in 1901; and the Technical Instruction Act 1908 later empowered the government to take over existing technical colleges. Queensland Government control of technical colleges in turn facilitated the combination of technical colleges and state high schools on the same sites.
In accordance with the Queensland Government's decision to provide free secondary education, in late January 1912 the first three Queensland state high schools were opened: in Gympie, Warwick, and Bundaberg. They were followed a week later by high schools in Mackay, Mount Morgan and Charters Towers. High tops were soon established at primary schools at Childers, Gatton and Herberton. In accordance with government policy, high schools were not opened in towns with existing grammar schools, although the government planned to take over any grammar schools at a later date.
The Bundaberg State High School was accommodated at Bundaberg Technical College, in a former Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations (BSES) laboratory building, on a small site,  north of Quay Street and west of Maryborough Street. The technical college, established in the Bundaberg School of Arts c.1889, had relocated to this riverside site in early 1911.
By March 1912, Bundaberg SHS had an attendance of 97 pupils. As the high school and technical college shared the same site, there was soon pressure to find a new home for the high school. The school's first principal, Berthold Henry Charles Krone, noted in 1914 that a reserve, which had been set aside for high school purposes, would be a suitable location, with more room for sports. This land was a Reserve for a Grammar School, gazetted in 1887, located in Bundaberg South, between Maryborough Street and the North Coast railway line, north of the Lady Chelmsford Hospital. In 1916 the Minister for Education, Herbert Hardacre, agreed that the Grammar School Reserve should be used for the high school, while the technical college should have a new building on its current site by the river.
The high school was still operating at the technical college in late 1918, even though enrolments at both the high school and technical college were increasing, after a decline during World War I. The Queensland Government eventually decided to build a combined technical college and high school on the Grammar School Reserve, and Public Works expenditure of £9,026 was approved in October 1919. The Technical College Committee later claimed it had always been opposed to moving to the new site, which it argued was too remote and dangerous for female students to attend night classes.
The first purpose-built high school buildings in Queensland were constructed in 1917 and were large, elaborate buildings that were variations of a standard design introduced in 1914 (the suburban timber school building), as well as vocational buildings built to standard designs. suburban timber school buildings solved many of the problems of light, ventilation, and classroom size that had plagued previous school designs as well as providing the ideal, modern education environment. The type was timber-framed, highset with covered play space beneath, and classrooms were vented by a system of metal ducts leading to prominent roof vents. A continuous ventilation flap was also provided on the wall at floor level. Large banks of windows were set on the south side, to provide left hand natural light to pupils, and classroom wings were linked by verandahs. Larger examples had a symmetrical arrangement of wings. Classrooms were wide, and hat and coat rooms, plus teachers rooms, were provided.
The new Bundaberg State High School and Technical College building was a large variant of a suburban timber school building. It was under construction in early 1920 when the Railway Department, which sought to build a locomotive depot on the Grammar School Reserve, was forced to back down in the face of public protest. The building was almost complete by December 1920.
The new school building (Block D in 2017) was officially opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, John Huxham, on 24 January 1921. Block D was set on concrete piers and was roofed with asbestos slates, with three large ornamental ventilating fleches on the roof, and decorative timber work to the three projecting gables. The central wing contained six classrooms, including a chemistry lecture room (with four large rooms and two smaller, for a total of 180 pupils); separate male and female teachers rooms, located between the first and second, and fifth and sixth classrooms; and separate hat and coat rooms for boys and girls (accessed off the verandah), partitioned off the northern part of the second and fifth classrooms and the teachers rooms. The ceilings were coved, with metal tie rods, and ventilation ducts ran between the ceiling vents and the fleches. A central gabled verandah annexe to the north had stairs up to an entry porch and hall, with a room for the head teacher on the west side, and for the record clerk and library on the east side. A verandah, with two sets of stairs, ran along the north side of the central wing, connecting with the verandah annexe's entrance hall and two end corridors located between the central wing and the east and west wings, which were perpendicular to the main wing.
The two end wings (which could accommodate a total of 100 pupils) had their own side verandah and stairs. The east wing contained a chemistry room, and a mechanical drawing and physics room, with a balance room, polariscope (used for examining substances) room and store between the main rooms. The west wing contained a bookkeeping room and domestic science room, separated by a fitting room and store. The understorey was open, except for under the verandah annexe, and some battening, and the floor was concreted. Male and female hand basins were located under the verandah annexe. Three additional piers were provided to support the balance table in the eastern wing (not extant, although their position is still discernible in the understorey's concrete floor).
Bundaberg received the third purpose-built high school of the suburban timber school building type, after Gympie State High School and Lockyer State High School, Gatton (similar new buildings were opened at both schools in 1917). As the original buildings at the latter schools were demolished in the 1950s, Bundaberg's Block D is now the earliest surviving purpose-built state high school building of its type in Queensland.
A smaller building (the eastern wing of Block G in 2017) was also constructed, as an annexe for cookery and woodworking classes, just to the south of Block D, with a parade ground between the two buildings. The annexe was lowset, with a Dutch gable roof which was sheeted with red fibre cement tiles. It had a cookery classroom on the east side, and a larger woodworking classroom on the west side. The interior had a coved ceiling with exposed metal ties. The walls of the woodworking room were unlined. There was a verandah on the north side, and a stair to the verandah led to a small, central, projecting bay with a gable roof. The walls were clad externally with weatherboards. The windows were casements, and two stove recesses, projecting from the southern elevation of the cookery classroom, had separate skillion roofs with short chimneys. Although it predates standard designs for vocational buildings that were introduced in 1928, Block G shares a number of characteristics of the later buildings: it is lowset, timber framed, with a Dutch gable roof, a verandah, and a pair of stove recesses for the cookery classroom.
The spacious new grounds in Bundaberg South allowed the high school to finally have sporting facilities: a tennis court was opened in July 1921, and a cricket pitch was formed by December.
During the 1920s some changes were made to the school buildings, and the size of the school grounds. Motor shafts were bolted to concrete foundations under the woodworking half of Block G ,  and in 1923 the school reserve was increased to , and . In 1925-6 the old sugar laboratory was moved from its Quay Street site to the Bundaberg State High School and Technical College, east of Block G - where it was used for woodworking. Block G was then converted solely to domestic science use, with a lined and ceiled dressmaking classroom (and curtained-off dining area) replacing the woodworking classroom, and a new servery in the partition with the cookery room.
During the 1930s, an Intermediate School was added at the Bundaberg State High School and Technical College, in a new building located southeast of Block G. The idea of creating an intermediate level of schooling emerged in Queensland during the late 1920s. Intermediate schools initially catered for years six and seven, and offered vocational subjects: manual training for boys and domestic science for girls. The first intermediate schools were established within existing school facilities at Warwick, Charters Towers, Mount Morgan and South Brisbane from 1928. The first purpose-built intermediate school building was erected in 1932 within the grounds of Warwick State High School.
The Intermediate School building (not extant) at Bundaberg, erected during 1933 and opened in February 1934, was another large suburban timber school building: highset, timber, with three projecting gables and a central roof fleche. Similar in size and plan to Block D, it was also symmetrical, with a northern verandah and verandah annexe, teachers rooms and hat rooms, plus six classrooms in the central wing, and two classrooms in each of its east and west wings. By 1933 a small building, an engineering workshop, also existed south of Block G, making a total of five teaching buildings at the school.
Other changes occurred at the school in the 1930s. In 1935 more land was added to the school grounds, this time in the southeast corner, when was obtained, opposite Goodwin (now Watson) Street. This became the site of a janitor's residence (not extant). In 1937 a domestic science classroom, with a coved ceiling and a tiled Dutch gable roof, was constructed off the centre of the northern verandah of Block G. A hat room was added to the east end of the verandah, and a teachers room to the west end. Minor changes to Blocks G and D also occurred , when the doorways to two of the store rooms in the east wing of Block D were reconfigured, and the hat room at the east end of Block G's verandah was converted into a laundry.  
By 1940 there were toilets under the south ends of the wings of Block D (for boys and male teachers under the east wing, and girls and female teachers under the west wing). At this time there were 10 teaching buildings at the school - including four to the west of Blocks D and G, and two to the south of Block G and the old sugar laboratory (the old laboratory, the first home of the high school, was removed in the 1970s). By the end of 1940 the high school had an attendance of 183.
More buildings were added to the school in the 1950s. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nation-wide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the "baby boom". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended. The Queensland Government also continued its focus on vocational education during the 1950s and 1960s. New standard types were developed, including a brick veneer, concrete slab-on-ground and steel portal frame structure for manual training in 1958.
The 1950s technical college workshop buildings at Bundaberg SHS are a reflection of the industrial economy of Bundaberg, with its foundries, sugar mills and distilleries. A timber-framed technical college workshop building (Workshop No.1, or Block R in 2017) was added south of the engineering shop to the south of Block G, during 1955-6, the first of a projected scheme for four workshops, in a north-south line, linked by covered walkways. Used for engineering trades, it was , with a twin sawtooth roof. Its clerestory windows faced to the south; and had concrete ramps to double doors on the north and west sides. After WWII, similar sawtooth roofed technical college workshop buildings were constructed at Ipswich, Maryborough, Mackay and Cairns.
During 1955-6 Block G was extended to the north, at its west end. The new wing, with a hipped and gabled roof, had an eastern verandah (connecting to the original building's north verandah), and a western verandah. There were two sets of stairs off the east verandah, and one off the west verandah. The 1920 building's dressmaking room now became a second cookery room, with the dining area partitioned off, and new casement windows were added to the south elevation. The 1950s wing's rooms, from the south, included: dressmaking, with a staff room and fitting room to the north; then another fitting room, for a second dressmaking room to the north.
Workshop No.2 (Block M in 2017), for Motor Engineering, was planned in 1955, south of Block R, but was not built until 1958-9. By this time the use of timber for technical college workshops was less common. Block M also had a twin sawtooth roof; and ramps to two of its doorways, on the west and south sides. The two workshop buildings were connected by a covered way at their east ends. In September 1958 estimates were provided for partitioning workshop No.2 for a car electrics lab, battery room, store, diesel fuel lab, fitting shop, tool room, metrology lab, and vehicle workspace and general workshop area. A hydraulic hoist was also fitted. A skillion extension was added to the north side of Block M in the late 1960s. A third workshop was added south of Block M by 1964, but did not have a sawtooth roof.
Enrolments at the high school rose in the 1960s. Year Eight students were taught at the high school from 1964, and by 1967 Bundaberg SHS was the second largest high school outside the Brisbane metropolitan area, and the fifth largest in Queensland.  As a result, the school continued to change from the 1960s, as multiple new buildings were added and old buildings were removed. Most additions have tended to match the northerly orientation of the original school buildings, giving the school its regular layout. Of the school buildings present in the late 1950s, only Blocks D, G, R and M survive in 2017. In 1963, changing rooms were added under the north ends of the east and west wings of Block D (only the north end of the west wing was still enclosed in 2017).
There were also changes to the school's administrative structure during the 1960s. The Intermediate section of the High School closed at the end of 1963, and the technical college separated from the high school in 1965, with its own principal and administration. Growth continued in the 1970s. By April 1973 the school had an enrolment of 1673, and in 1975 plans were made to convert the soon-to-be-vacated technical college buildings to high school use. The use of the workshops also changed in the 1970s. In 1971 Block R was used for "Fitting and Turning", and Block M for "Auto Mechanics". By 1978, Block R was a gymnasium, while Block M was still used for manual arts.
The school grounds continued to expand. In 1978 there were four houses north of Boreham Street, while two tennis courts had been added at the east end of the north side of the street (1972). The current Boreham Street was formed further north by 1984, and the land formerly occupied by houses was added to the school grounds in 1988.
Changes to the buildings and grounds continued from the 1980s onwards. In 1987 Block D was converted for use by the Commercial Department, and as a computer centre. By 2003 Block G was used for English, and Blocks R and M were used for Technical Studies; while the enclosure for hand basins under the verandah annexe of Block D, and the changing rooms under the north end of the block's east and west wings, had become storerooms. The Intermediate School building was removed by 2003. Block D was converted for the Commercial Department in 1987. In 2013 the school grounds were extended south to Walker Street, absorbing Barber Park (the former Lady Chelmsford Hospital site).
In 2017 the school continues to operate from its 1921 site, and its grounds now cover . The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there.
Description.
Bundaberg State High School occupies a large () site fronting Maryborough Street, approximately south of the main centre of the Bundaberg. It is surrounded by residential development and its western boundary is defined by the North Coast Railway Line. The school buildings stand at the centre of the long rectangular site in a compact manner and are largely oriented to the north, which is diagonal to the site boundaries.
Block D (1920).
Block D is a large one-storey, highset, timber-framed building standing in the centre of the site, tightly crowded by other, later buildings to the north. It is symmetrical and comprises a long central wing of classrooms with its long sides facing north and south and it has a verandah running along the northern side providing circulation. This wing has a long gable roof and a wide, central entrance bay projects from the front, emphasised by a tall perpendicular gable roof projecting front and back. Originally the front entrance to the school, accommodating a head teacher's room and a library and clerk's room, the entrance bay has its own small, gable-roofed porch and, although it was originally open and verandah-like, it is now enclosed with weatherboards. It was reached from the ground via a branching stair that is now demolished. At either end of the long wing is a short perpendicular wing of classrooms that also has projecting gables front and back and their own separate outward-facing verandah. The building is clad with weatherboards generally, but is single-skin where the walls are protected by a verandah. The roofs are clad with modern steel sheets and have wide eaves lined with v-jointed (vj) boards above exposed rafters.
The building employs simple materials and details with a focus on providing natural light and ventilation.
The central entrance bay is emphasised by the greatest use of decoration, incorporating timber shingles as wall cladding at the gable apex, whereas the other gable ends have weatherboards, packed open to create gaps for ventilating the roof space behind. The gables have timber battening and shaped barge boards. The roof is surmounted by three large ventilation fleches; one above the central bay and one above each of the end wings. The fleches are open timber-framed elements and appear like bellcotes sheltering plain metal ventilators under bellcast spire roofs decoratively clad with patterned pressed metal sheets. The central fleche and is topped by a metal weather vane finial.
The building has large banks of timber-framed windows, many of which face south, allowing a high level of natural light and ventilation into the classrooms. The window banks comprise a row of casements below a row of horizontal pivot sashes below a row of fanlights, which were originally inwardly opening hopper sashes but have mostly been fixed closed. The central bay has smaller areas of casement windows sheltered by hoods with timber brackets, as are the large banks of windows in the gable ends.
The verandah is accessed by later steel stairs that replicate the form and location of the timber originals. The verandah has arched timber brackets between posts and the original timber balustrade is retained on the end wings but has been replaced by bag racks on the centre wing. The wall between the verandah and the classrooms retains original double-hung sash windows, some of which have fanlights, and pairs of timber French doors. However, some modern aluminium-framed sliding windows have been added, and some modern doors have been inserted or replaced original French doors. All but one of the original arched openings from the verandah into the former teachers' rooms and hats and coats rooms have been removed and sheeted as these rooms have been incorporated into the classrooms by removing the partitions. This and the part removal of partitions between classrooms have resulted in large, continuous interior spaces. The end wings are more intact and retain the original layout although small alterations have been made to the ancillary rooms by removing partitions to combine them. The interior walls are lined with v-jointed timber boards (original) or plasterboard sheeting (modern). In parts, the rooms have an operable timber ventilation board at the wall base that is original. This appears to relate to the original locations of classrooms (ventilated) and hat and coat rooms (unventilated). The former head teacher's room and the library and record clerk's rooms retain original sheet and battened ceilings in a decorative pattern with a central latticed ventilation panel, but all other rooms have a modern suspended ceiling, behind which the coved timber board lined ceiling and iron tie rod probably survive.
The central bay has an elaborate timber entrance door with side and fanlights of leaded and coloured glass and moulded timber panelling.  The door itself has moulded panels and a large, textured glass pane, which is not original. A small sliding glass hatch from the entrance hallway into the library and record clerk's room survives.
There are original and early fixtures including ceramic sinks within the building.
The understorey is largely open and the floor is a concrete slab with a perimeter spoon drain. The stumps are concrete (original) and there are notches indicating where a battened perimeter skirt (now removed) was fixed. The original enclosure for hand basins under the central entrance bay is retained although these have been converted to store rooms and all original toilet fabric has been removed from the interior. Other enclosures, under the building's end wings, are later and comprise toilets (built 1940) and female changing rooms (1963). The toilets are highly intact with female toilets at the south end of the west wing and male toilets at the south end of the east wing, reflecting the former gender segregation of the technical classrooms under which they are located. They incorporate separate toilets and entrances for teachers and retain timber partitions and doors. No longer used, the female changing rooms are located north of the female toilets and have concrete shower partitions. The male changing rooms, previously north of the male toilets, have been demolished.
Block G (1920, extended 1937 and 1956).
Block G, originally a domestic science and woodworking building, stands behind (to the south of) Block D, separated from it by a bitumen parade ground. It is a lowset, timber-framed building comprising two perpendicular wings in an L shape. The earliest wing (built in 1920) faces north and has a northern verandah and a Dutch gable roof. Projecting from the front of this wing is a large lecture room (built 1937) also with a Dutch gable roof. The later wing (built 1956) projects forward (north) of the original wing at its western end. It has a verandah on its eastern and western sides and a gable roof. All roofs are clad with corrugated metal sheets and have wide eaves lined with flat sheets with timber cover battens.
The building is clad with weatherboards generally but is single-skin (externally-exposed framing) where walls are protected by a verandah. The verandah of the 1920 wing retains its laundry enclosure at the eastern end, and projecting from the rear of this wing are two stove recesses clad with weatherboards, reflecting the original domestic science classroom use. The building retains its original fenestration with some windows having high sills, however, the original timber-framed casement and double-hung sashes have been replaced with aluminium-framed sliding sashes in all but a few locations. The fanlights above these sashes are also replacements.
Timber stairs provide access to the verandah and are original except for one steel replacement in the original location and configuration. Original post and rail verandah and stair balustrades are retained. The verandah ceiling of the earliest wing is lined with timber vj boards and in the later wing with flat sheets with timber cover battens. Evidence of the original verandah skylights on the western verandah is retained in the ceiling, however, these have been sheeted over and no longer permit high-levels of natural light into the former dressmaking classrooms of this wing.
The internal layout is highly intact. The earlier wing comprises two large classrooms (cookery classrooms in 1956), separated by a narrow room (a dining room in 1956), and a large lecture room projection from the northern verandah. These rooms are accessed from the verandah via pairs of timber French doors with fanlights and have tall, coved ceilings braced internally with an exposed iron tie rod. The walls and ceilings are lined with timber vj boards and have ventilation panels that are sheeted over. The rooms retain picture rails and the stove recesses have been converted to cupboards with shelves. The later wing comprises two large classrooms (dressmaking in 1956) separated by a staff room that has been created by removing the original partitions that formed the small fitting and staff rooms. These rooms are accessed from the verandah via timber French doors with glazed panels and fanlights and have flat ceilings. The walls and ceilings are lined with flat sheets with timber cover battens in a decorative pattern.
Block R (1956) and Block M (1959).
Blocks R and M stand to the south of Block G with Block M behind (to the south of) Block R. They are aligned with each other and are identical timber-framed workshop buildings comprising two long bays with south-facing sawtooth roofs. They have concrete slab-on-ground foundations and are clad with weatherboards up to window sill level with sheet material above that. The roofs are clad with corrugated metal sheets. A short covered walkway (1959) connects the two buildings at the eastern end. The buildings have large areas windows on all sides to permit high levels of natural light, however, the original timber-framed sashes have been replaced with aluminium framed sliding sashes in all cases except for four banks in the northern wall of Block M. The clerestory windows have been sheeted over or replaced with glass louvres. Block M retains original timber French doors and one pair of timber board doors large enough to permit big machinery. Block R does not retain original doors.
The interiors have had partitions installed. Block R has been partitioned to accommodate offices and other small spaces and a suspended ceiling has been installed throughout except in the western end, which retains its original open, lofty spatial qualities. Block M has had much less partitioning (possibly early) but has had a ceiling installed throughout. Block M has also had a skillion roofed extension added to its northern side, which is not of cultural heritage significance. Two early ceramic sinks are retained in Block M.
The Grounds.
The school complex comprises many other buildings and structures that are not of cultural heritage significance. However, the buildings are generally long and narrow and are oriented identically with their long sides north and south, not oriented to the street or boundaries. This has created a cohesive campus with many long narrow spaces between buildings. A large school oval is at the northern end of the site and a mature poinciana ("Delonix regia") stands at near the boundary of the school on Maryborough Street near the intersection with Ruddell Street that marks an early entrance to the school.
Heritage listing.
Bundaberg State High School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 June 2017 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
Bundaberg State High School (established in 1912 as one of Queensland's first six state high schools, and opened on its current site in 1921) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains excellent, representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities and mature trees.
Block D (1920), the oldest surviving purpose-built state high school building of its type in Queensland, is important in demonstrating the Queensland Government's policy of providing free secondary education. 
Block G, the former vocational building (1920, extended 1937 and 1956), and the two sawtooth roofed technical college workshop buildings, Block R (1956) and Block M (1959), reflect the Queensland Government's focus on vocational training as a way of ensuring the state's economic prosperity. The three vocational buildings are also important in demonstrating the way secondary and technical education were interlinked in the early 20th century, with high schools and technical colleges operating from the same site.
The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage.
Bundaberg State High School's Block D is the oldest surviving purpose-built state high school building of its type in Queensland.
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.
Bundaberg State High School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early state high school with later modifications. This includes generous, landscaped sites with mature shade trees, parade ground and play areas, sporting facilities, timber-framed teaching buildings of standard designs, classrooms with high levels of natural light and ventilation, and separate vocational buildings.
Block D's design is a variation of the standard design for suburban timber school buildings and from the design of Technical Colleges of the time. Block D demonstrates the principal characteristics of its type through: its highset, timber-framed construction; an open understorey that accommodates a play area and toilets; symmetrical design with wings linked by verandahs; head teacher's room, clerk's room/library, and evidence of the two teachers rooms; lofty classrooms lit by large banks of windows on the southern side to provide left hand natural light to students; and a strong consideration for natural ventilation, including hinged wall ventilation flaps at floor level and distinctive roof fleches.
Block G is a forerunner of the standard design for vocational buildings. It retains its lowset, timber-framed construction; a pair of stove recesses for the former cookery classroom; a verandah with a laundry enclosure; verandah circulation on the northern side; large areas of south-facing windows to the classrooms; and a Dutch gable roof.
Blocks R and M are technical college workshop buildings which retain their: large, timber-framed sawtooth roof form; robust structure of long spans creating open floor plans; large areas of windows providing high levels of natural light and ventilation into the interior; and robust use of materials suitable for a workshop environment.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations.
Bundaberg State High School has a strong and ongoing association with the Bundaberg community. It was established in 1912 and opened on its current site in 1921, and generations of Bundaberg students have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of Bundaberg and as a focus for the community.

Louis Le Provost de Launay

Louis Le Provost de Launay (8 June 1850 – 17 August 1912) was a French politician who was Deputy and then Senator for the department of Côtes-du-Nord (now called Côtes-d'Armor).
He was a right-wing Bonapartist.
Early years.
Louis Le Provost de Launay was born on 8 June 1850 in Libourne, Gironde.
His father was Auguste-Pierre-Marie Le Provost de Launay (1823–1886).
His father was a prefect of the Second French Empire who was elected a representative in the National Assembly in 1874, deputy from 1877 to 1881, and senator from 1885 to 1886.
Louis Le Provost de Launay studied law in Paris and obtained his license.
For a period he was secretary to Théodore Grandperret.
At the start of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he joined the "Chasseurs d'Afrique" as a private soldier, and later was made a sub-officer.
After the war he received his doctorate in law and was admitted to the Bar in 1872.
Local politics.
In 1875 Le Provost de Launay was elected general councilor for Côtes-du-Nord representing the canton of La Roche-Derrien.
He was elected mayor of Penvénan on 18 May 1884. 
He was replaced on 10 December 1893 by Pierre Le Provost de Launay.
In 1895 Le Provost de Launay, afraid of losing his seat in the general council, moved from the canton of La Roche to the canton of Tréguier. 
In 1901 he was defeated in the cantonal elections and lost Tréguier to Gustave de Kerguézec(), who was later elected a radical deputy in 1906.
Deputy.
Le Provost de Launay was elected to the Chamber of Deputies for Côtes-du-Nord on 20 February 1876.
He was elected deputy for the 2nd constituency of Lannion, Côtes-du-Nord, by 7,076 votes to 4,237 for M. Le Gac.
In the chamber Le Provost de Launay was prominent in the Appel au peuple group led by Paul de Cassagnac, and was active in opposition to the republicans led by Léon Gambetta.
He supported the government of the 16th of May.
After being reelected unopposed on 14 October 1877 he voted against the cabinet of Dufaure and against the left-wing cabinets that succeeded it.
He was against the amnesty of the leaders of the Paris Commune.
Le Provost de Launay was again reelected without competition on 21 August 1881.
He was involved in discussions on the budget, public education, colonial policy and state railways.
His 1883 proposal to drop the requirement for municipalities to have a rural guard passed into law the next year.
He voted against the Gambetta, Freycinet, and Jules Ferry ministries and against the credits for the Tonkin expedition.
When the right-wing Ligue des Patriotes was created in 1882, members of the Appel au Peuple committee were present at the constitutive general assembly, as were Blanquists, revisionists, members of the Jeunesse Antisémite and members of Jules Guérin's Antisemitic League of France.
Le Provost de Launay and Jules de Cuverville, both prominent Bonapartists, were members of the steering committee.
On 4 October 1885 Le Provost de Launay ran on the conservative list in Côtes-du-Nord and was elected first out of nine.
He voted against reinstatement of the district poll, for indefinite postponement of revision of the Constitution, against prosecution of three members of the Ligue des Patriotes, against the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and against the prosecution of General Boulanger.
Le Provost de Launay was reelected on 22 September 1889, holding office until 14 October 1893, again sitting with the Conservative Union group.
He again represented the second constituency of Lannion and was again elected without opposition.
He continued to attack the republican regime, including during the debates over the conquest of Dahomey.
He and Jules Delahaye brought up the Panama scandals, and he made a speech in which he denounced the manipulations of the so-called 104 parliamentarians.
This proved fatal to him, and both he and Delahaye failed to be reelected in 1893.
Le Provost de Launay was defeated by the republican candidate Paul Le Troadec, who won 5,578 votes to his 4,843.
His opponent was a farmer who was Mayor of Lézardrieux and a general councilor.
Senator.
Le Provost de Launay was elected to the Senate on 16 February 1896.
He defeated the Marquis de L'Angle Beaumanoir by 894 votes to 337 in a by-election.
He sat on the right, and was energetically opposed to colonial expeditions.
He again intervened on the Panama scandals.
He was very active in the debates over the Dreyfus affair.
Le Provost de Launay was reelected on 4 January 1903 and 7 January 1912.
In the Senate he continued to oppose the republicans.
In May 1903 he called on the government to regulate the use of automobiles on public roads.
He was involved in questions related to army, opposed to excessively harsh treatment of soldiers but concerned that common criminals should be dismissed.
He was also concerned with defending free education and the separation of church and state.
Louis Le Provost de Launay died in office on 17 August 1912 in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie.
Publications.
The Bibliothèque nationale de France lists 34 documents published by Le Provost de Launay, mostly a few pages extracted from an official journal that give the text of a speech or legislative proposal.

Valmarana family

The Valmarana family is an aristocratic family in Vicenza, one branch of which also held Venetian patrician status. Its motto was "Plus Ultra" (Further). They were named after the village of Valmarana (now part of Altavilla Vicentina) in the Berici Hills, where they held fiefs from the bishop of Vicenza.
History.
According to legend, the family was descended from the ancient Roman Maria gens. In 1031 they were made counts by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor. On 30 April 1540 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor issued a special diploma making them counts palatine of Nogara.
Their title of count was also recognised by the Republic of Venice. In 1659 the family branch led by the brothers Triffone, Stefano and Benedetto was given Venetian patrician status after they paid 100,000 ducats to help fund the Cretan War This made them one of the 'Case fatte per soldo' (houses whose patrician position was achieved through money). Another line of the family did not join the Venetian patricians but did still sit in the Noble Council in Vicenza itself. Under the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia both branches were granted noble status and the rank of count of the Austrian Empire by Sovereign Resolutions on 18 December 1817, 11 March 1820 and 13 March 1825.

Min fanglei

The Min fanglei () is an ancient Chinese bronze "lei" vessel from the late Shang dynasty or early Western Zhou dynasty (12th – 11th century BC). It is one of the largest of its kind, and called the "King of Fanglei". After its accidental discovery in 1919 in Hunan, its lid remained in China but the body was sold to collectors overseas, and set a world-record auction price for an Asian art work in 2001 when it fetched US$9.24 million. In 2014, a group of Chinese collectors bought it for a price between US$20 and 30 million, and donated it to the Hunan Museum, where it was reunited with its lid.
Description.
The Min "fanglei" is dated to the late Shang dynasty or early Western Zhou dynasty (12th – 11th century BC). It is a "fanglei", or square or rectangular "lei," a type of ancient Chinese ritual bronze vessel. The Min "fanglei" is tall, and its mouth measures . Without the lid, it is 64 cm (25 inches) tall and weighs 42 kg (92.5 pounds). It is finely decorated on each of its four sides, with pairs of dragons cast on its shoulders and a horned dragon mask on its handle. Because of its size and workmanship, it is called the "King of Fanglei".
The "fanglei" is named for the bronze inscription inside its body, which reads "Min zuo Fu Ji zun yi" (), or "Min made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji". On the inside of its lid, the inscription has two extra characters: "Min Er [or Tian] Quan zuo Fu Ji zun yi" (皿而[or 天]全作父己尊彝), or "Min Er [or Tian] Quan made [this] esteemed vessel for Father Ji".
Modern history.
The Min "fanglei" was accidentally discovered in 1919 in Maoshanyu, Shuitian Township (now Jiaqiao Town), Taoyuan County, Hunan Province. According to local records, a boy named Ai Xinzhai () found the vessel lying partly exposed on a mountain slope and told his father Ai Qingyan (), who then dug it out.
In 1924, Shi Yuzhang () bought the body of the vessel for a substantial sum. Ai Qingyan kept the lid, which he gave to his son's school, Xinmin School (), in lieu of tuition. The staff of the school read the inscription inside the lid and recognized its significance. After the "Ta Kung Pao" in Changsha reported the discovery of the artifact on June 11, 1925, Zhang Shizhao, the provincial education director, attempted to retrieve the vessel but was unable to locate it.
Zhou Pan (), a local military officer, purchased the lid for 3,000 silver dollars. When Zhou was arrested in Kunming, Yunnan in 1950, the lid was confiscated and given to the Hunan Cultural Relics Management Committee, which was merged into Hunan Museum in 1956.
In 1928, French scholar George Soulié de Morant published "A History of Chinese Art", which included a photograph of the Min "fanglei" (without the lid) and noted that it had been collected by prominent art dealers including C. T. Loo, A. W. Bahr, and C. F. Yau ().
The vessel was bought by Japanese collector Umekichi Asano () in 1930, and then sold to Taiwanese-Japanese collector Munachi Nita (新田栋一; Chinese name Peng Kaidong 彭楷棟) in 1950. When Nita put it on auction with Christie's in 2001, Shanghai Museum and Poly Museum raised a large sum to make a bid for the vessel, but were outbid by a French collector for US$9.24 million. At the time it was a world-record price for an Asian artwork.
In 2014, the Min "fanglei" was again put on auction by Christie's. On March 19, a day before the auction was scheduled to take place, Christie's announced that the owner had agreed to sell the vessel to a group of private Chinese collectors, who then donated it to Hunan Museum to be reunited with its lid, from which it had been separated for 90 years. Christie's did not disclose the sale price, but Sina News reported it to be US$20 million, while another estimate gave $30 million.
On January 14, 2018, the Min "fanglei" was featured on the Chinese TV program "National Treasure".

John Blackie

John Blackie LLD DL (1805–1873) was a 19th-century Scottish publisher and the "son" of Blackie &amp; Son who served as Lord Provost of Glasgow from 1863 to 1866.
The company specialised in printing annotated bibles and religious works including Scotland's first religious newspaper, the Scottish Guardian.
Life.
He was born near Glasgow on 27 September 1805 the eldest of eight children of John Blackie (1782-1874) and his wife, Catherine Duncan. He was educated at William Angus's English School on Ingram Street then at the Glasgow High School.
Around 1830 the family moved to Glasgow where his father was partner in Blackie, Fullarton &amp; Co at 8 East Clyde Street on the north side of the River Clyde. The family then lived at 18 Monteith Row. In 1831 following the death of Fullarton the company renamed as Blackie &amp; Son but still operated from 8 Clyde Street. In 1837 a sister company was set up by John's younger brother, Walter Graham Blackie (1816-1906), and named W. G. Blackie &amp; Co, which existed concurrently with but separate from Blackie &amp; Son.
In 1857 Blackie joined Glasgow town council as a Liberal councillor. He became burgh magistrate in 1859. In 1863 he was elected Lord Provost and served for three years, succeeding to Peter Clouston. His main achievement in this role was in the instigation and implementation of Glasgow's City Improvement Act of 1865 which began a programme of slum clearance and rebuilding. A fresh water supply from Loch Katrine was also agreed and implemented.
John died of pleurisy on 12 February 1873 at his home Lilybank House in the Hillhead district.
At the death of John Blackie senior in 1874 (outliving his son) the company passed to various of his grandsons and the company was rebranded as Blackie &amp; Co Ltd.
Family.
In 1849 he married Agnes Gourlay daughter of William Gourlay, a Glasgow merchant of 8 South Frederick Street.
They had three sons who later rebranded the company as Blackie &amp; Co.
Artistic Recognition.
Blackie's photograph, by David Octavius Hill is held by the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.

Marie Recio

Marie Recio, "née" Marie-Geneviève Martin (10 June 1814 – 13 June 1862) was a French 19th-century opera singer (mezzo-soprano), the second wife of Hector Berlioz.
Biography.
Marie Recio was born in Châtenay-Malabry to a French military father, Colonel Joseph Martin (1758-1836), battalion commander and a Spanish mother. Peter Bloom believes that it is likely that she took singing lessons from the great Italian singer David Banderali (an academic at the Conservatoire de Paris from 1828 to 1849), being the friend of his daughter, Anne Barthe. In the 1830s, she became a professional singer in Paris.
Berlioz and Marie met around 1840. Maybe is it for Marie Recio that Berlioz began "Les Nuits d'été", with "Absence" (1841, the fourth piece of the final collection), which she often sang and that the musician orchestrated as soon as 1843. Berlioz himself confided: "She's meowing like a dozen cats."
Thanks to Berlioz's influence, she made her debut at the Opéra-Comique on 9 October 1841, but it was a fiasco and she only held the position for a few months. Her repertoire was limited: Inès in Donizetti's "La Favorite", Isolier in Rossini's "Le Comte Ory" and Alice in Meyerbeer's "Robert le Diable". It seems that the singer had a stage fright that deprived her of her skills.
Marie and Berlioz travelled to Brussels in September 1842 and she accompanied him on his various journeys to Prague in 1846 etc.
The couple lived together from 1844 and for almost twenty years. He married her on 19 October 1854, at the Sainte Trinité church in Paris. During all these years, she became collaborator and manager of the musician.
She died of a heart disease at a friend's home in Saint-Germain-en-Laye at age 48. Her mother, Marie Sotera Villas Recio, stayed with the composer until his last days.
She appeared under the features of actress Renée Saint-Cyr, in "La Symphonie fantastique" (1942), a feature film by Christian-Jaque.

The MHV 900 Class is the Danish Home Guard's newest ship class. It is a further development of the MHV 800 class and is about 3.50 meters longer and several tons heavier. The increased size allows the ship class to carry 2 float locks of 180 meters, which gives the Danish pollution preparedness a noticeable lift upward. In addition, the class is equipped with several fire pumps and a water cannon, so it can also be added to fire fighting. The ships are part of the Navy's normal task complex.

Friedrich Tischler (2 June 1881 - 29 January 1945) was a German lawyer and ornithologist who studied the birds of East Prussia and published a two volume work on them. He was working on another major work which was destroyed during the Second World War. He committed suicide along with his wife when Soviet troops marched into Germany.
Biography.
Tischler was the brother of the botanist Georg Tischler (1878-1955) and the son of Oskar Tischler (1843-1891), a landowner in Losgehnen. Tischler studied law in Königsberg, Leipzig and Munich and worked as a magistrate in Heilsberg. He took an early interest in birds and biology thanks to his tutor Karl Borowski, and became a member of the Deutschen Ornithologen Gesellschaft (German Ornithologists Society) in 1908 and spent time in an ornithological station on the Curonian Spit, meeting Johannes Thienemann and spent time at the Zoological Institute of the Königsberg Albertina University. He built up an insect collection and a herbarium. He published "Die Vögel der Provinz Ostpreußen" (the birds of the East Prussian province) in 1914 and a two volume "Die Vögel Ostpreußens und seiner Nachbargebiete" (the birds of east Prussia and neighbourhood) in 1941. He was appointed as a Foreign Scientific member of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society for the Advancement of Science and was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Königsberg Albertina University.
Friedrich Tischler was married to Rose Kowalski (1884-1945). The manuscript of a third work was destroyed in the Bombing of Königsberg. While Soviet troops invaded the region in the winter of 1945, the couple committed suicide next to a grave that they had their servant Karl Hartwig dig for themselves, most likely on the January 29, 1945. The site was recognizable only as a grassy mound overgrown with trees and it was only in 1999 that a memorial was set up by Polish and German ornithologists.
Otto Kleinschmidt named a subspecies "Parus borealis tischleri" after Tischler in 1917 but it is today considered a synonym. Similarly he also described "Accipiter tischleri" in 1938 which is a synonym of "Accipiter gentilis" and "Corvus coloeus tischleri" in 1935 which is a synonym of "Coloeus monedula soemmerringii".

Stinche Prison

The Stinche Prison (Italian: "carcere delle Stinche") was a prison on Via Ghibellina in the city of Florence, Italy. It stood more or less on the site now occupied by the Teatro Verdi.
History.
The earliest mention of a prison in Florence refers to the "Burellæ", the vaults under the ruins of the city's ancient Roman amphitheatre and theatre, which remained visible for most of the medieval period. Next the city built or adapted towers as prisons, such as the torre della Pagliazza. People were also imprisoned in the basement of the Palazzo del Capitano or the Bargello. A cramped but less spartan gaol known as the "Alberghetto" was sited in the Torre di Arnolfo of the Palazzo Vecchio - its 15th century inmates included Cosimo il Vecchio and Girolamo Savonarola. All these prisons were run by private individuals and inmates had to pay one 'libbra' a day to their gaoler to cover his expenses, meaning wealthier people could buy better treatment. The poor were very harshly treated and mainly had to cover their fees from alms - there were periodic amnesties on particular holidays and religious festivals, but these only released a very limited number of prisoners and did not include murderers, political prisoners and those who had committed other serious crimes.
The Stinche complex was built from 1299 onwards by the Florentine Republic, using many stones from towers and houses owned by the Ghibelline Uberti family, which had been demolished after that family was driven out of the city following the Battle of Benevento. It was a square building surrounded by a moat and a very high 18-metre-long wall with no openings - this gave it its nickname of the "Isola delle Stinche" or "Stinche Island". The building itself had only one door, known as the "Porta della miseria" after its inscription "Oportet misereri" (it requires charity), referring to the fact that the prison was funded by private individuals not the state. The Buononimi di San Martino and a sub-company of the Compagnia di Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio known as the Buononimi delle Stinche gave charity to the prisoners. The Compagnia appointed four Buononimi delle Stinche to manage their donations and bequests so as to provide spiritual aid, money and food to the prisoners, especially the poorer ones who could not afford to bribe the guards for better treatment. They gained so much authority that they were granted the right to free debtors on the condition that the Buononimi became their guarantors and oversaw whether or not the debts were paid.
In 1304 the prison's first inmates were Ghibellines taken in the capture of Stinche Castle, a Cavalcanti family stronghold near Greve in Chianti. The prison went on mainly to house prisoners of war and political prisoners. Most of Walter VI, Count of Brienne's political enemies were held there and the city's inhabitants stormed the prison. Orcagna was commissioned to paint a fresco of the event in the prison courtyard, entitled "The Fall of the Duke of Athens", in which saint Anne gives the Florentines the banners of the arts but an evil angel chases Walter from the city - the fresco is now in the museum in Palazzo Vecchio. Prisoners were led along the via Ghibellina to the execution site near Torre della Zecca. Tabernacles were set up along the route to comfort the condemned prisoners, such as the 'Tabernacolo delle Stinche' painted in 1616 by Giovanni da San Giovanni and remodelled in the 19th century by the architect Luigi Cambray-Digny.
Later the prison also housed debtors and bankrupts, including the historians Giovanni Villani (caught up in the Bardi and Peruzzi banking crises) and Giovanni Cavalcanti (who described his time there in "Storia dei suoi tempi"). Niccolò Machiavelli was another inmate after he was implicated in the Orti Oricellari plot, as were the Florentine ambassador to France Roberto Acciaioli, Francesco Gianfigliazzi's wife (imprisoned in 1440 after smuggling herself into the city in disguise to plead her exiled husband's case) and the Neapolitan ambassador Pietro Vespucci (for his part in the Pazzi Plot). The painter Cennino Cennini may have written his "Libro dell'arte" whilst imprisoned there, but this is uncertain.
In 1428 the Florentine Republic authorised the Compagnia di Santa Maria della Croce al Tempio to hire a doctor, a chaplain, a barber and a caretaker to assist the Buonomi delle Stinche at the prison. The Compagnia became so popular that it was granted an annual public subsidy of 112 gold florins, which supplemented the donations and bequests it also received. Also in 1428 public wash-houses were built against the prison's south side, as shown by the street name via dei Lavatoi. The prison was sold off by the state in 1833 and partially demolished, making room for a building for equestrian shows and a home for the Società Filarmonica Fiorentina - the latter was later transformed into the Teatro di Pagliano, which later still became the Teatro Verdi. After the prison closed its inmates were moved to the Le Murate complex just to its east.

The collection comprises artworks in the mediums of sculpture, photography and painting by international contemporary artists. The works are installed on five floors of the bunker, which the architect Jens Casper transformed into a compendium of individual rooms that interconnect on multiple floors.

Each exhibition in the bunker additionally includes site-specific works that refer to and interact with the various interior spaces and their history.
The collection is accessible to the public from Thursdays through Sundays only in the form of guided tours via prior application on the website of the collection.

<doc id="56649061" url="?curid=56649061" title="Caligula (horse)">
Caligula (horse)

Caligula (1917 – after 1936) was an Irish-bred British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. He was unraced as a two-year-old in 1919 before emerging as a top-class stayer in the following year. In his first eight races as a three-year-old he won a minor race at Newmarket and the Ascot Derby but looked outpaced when tried over shorter distances. He recorded his biggest win on his final appearance when he recorded an upset victory over a strong field in the St Leger. After being briefly exported to India he stood as a breeding stallion at various European locations but had little success as a sire of winners.
Background.
Caligula was a "striking" grey horse bred in County Kildare Ireland by James J. Maher. As a yearling he was put up for auction and bought for 3,100 guineas by Seymour Edward Frederick Egerton, 6th Earl of Wilton. Lord Wilton sent the colt into training with Harvey Leader at Newmarket, Suffolk.
He was sired by The Tetrarch an unbeaten horse who was regarded as one of the fastest two-year-old ever seen in Britain and Ireland, but whose career was ended by injury before he could race at three. The Tetrarch showed very little interest in his stud duties: his attitude towards sex was described as being "monastic in the extreme". Although he sired few foals his progeny included several major winners. Caligula's dam Snoot was an influential broodmare whose other descendants include Nashua, La Sorellina (Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe), King of Kings, American Flag, Blue Swords, Noverre, and Dance Partner.
Racing career.
1920: three-year-old season.
Caligula, who was unraced as a two-year-old, made his racecourse debut in the Severals Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse in April and finished second to Cicerole. At the next Newmarket meeting he finished down the field behind Tetratema in the 2000 Guineas and then recorded his first success in a minor race under a light weight of 100 pounds. Later that month he ran disappointingly when 1/3 favourite for a race at York Racecourse in May. In June, it became apparent that Lord Wilton, who was well known for his heavy betting, was experiencing financial difficulties: he withdrew Caligula from the Derby and was forced to cancel a "large private luncheon party". At Royal Ascot in June Caligula, ridden by Joe Childs started at odds of 10/1 for the Ascot Derby and won "easily" from Paladin and Novello, while the leading fancies Abbot's Trace and Hugo Cunliffe-Owen's Orpheus were unplaced. On the following day the colt was dropped in distance and was beaten into third behind Allenby and Edward Hulton's Silvern in the St James's Palace Stakes over one mile. At Goodwood Racecourse in July he ran unplaced behind Braishfield in the Sussex Stakes. On his last run before the St Leger Caligula ran in the £1,000 Richemount Plate at Hurst Park in August and finished a close fourth behind Bracket, Bideford and Most Beautiful.
In the late summer of 1920 Lord Wilton financial problems worsened and his creditors refused to let his horses race. With Caligula scheduled to run in the St Leger but unable to do so under Wilton's ownership, Harvey Leader embarked on a search for a new owner for the colt and a week before the race arranged his sale to the Indian industrialist and businessman Mathradas Goculdas. The sale was private but the price was reported to be approximately 8,000 guineas.
On 8 September, in front of an exceptionally large crowd at Doncaster Racecourse, Caligula stated at odds of 100/6 (approximately 16.7/1) for the 145th running of the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. Shortly before the race the colt had performed very impressively in a training gallop at Newmarket leading the "London Sportsman"s correspondent to describe him as a likely winner but this was a minority view. The Derby winner Spion Kop started favourite at 3/1 in a field of fourteen despite having had injury problems in the build up to the race, while the other fancied runners included Allenby, Silvern, Abbot's Trace and Orpheus. The race was run in a fog, and for most of the race the runners were not visible from the stands. When the leaders emerged from the murk in the straight Black Gauntlet was in front but Caligula, ridden by Arthur Smith, took the lead approaching the final furlong and held off a challenge from Silvern to win by half a length, with three lengths back to Lady James Douglas's Manton (a 33/1 outsider) in third place. Caligula's victory was surprising from a pedigree viewpoint as The Tetrarch's stock had previously been regarded as deficient in stamina.
Caligula earned £7,941 in 1920, making him the second most financially successful horse of the season behind the 1000 Guineas winner Cinna.
It was reported that Goculdas had imported Caligula in late September to India with the intention of racing him at least once (in the Viceroy's Cup) before standing him at stud. Later reports suggested that Goculdas had brought the colt to India simply to look at him before returning Caligula to England to begin his career as a breeding stallion.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Caligula an "inferior" winner of the St Leger.
Stud record.
Caligula stood as a breeding stallion in Britain, Germany and France, with his last foals being born in 1938. He had fertility problems throughout his stud career and sired few foals, but did get some good winners including The Consul (Yorkshire Cup).

Eaglehill

Eaglehill () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation of the Gaelic name is 'Tully-Lug-Skiver-An-Erla'. 
Geography.
Eaglehill is bounded on the north by Tullyloughfin townland, on the west by Tullybrack townland and on the east by Tullandreen and Corracholia More townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), forestry plantations and a gravel pit. Eaglehill is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 104 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
A lease dated 17 September 1816 John Enery of Bawnboy includes "Tullyscaravanerin".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list six tithepayers in the townland
An 1827 lease from Finlay to Elliott includes "Tullyscaravanerin".
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The townland is bounded on the north by a large mountain stream."
The Eaglehill Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 42, being 21 males and 21 females. There were nine houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 36, being 17 males and 19 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were six houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists six landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 45, being 22 males and 23 females. There were seven houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are nine families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are seven families listed in the townland.

Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site

Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site is a heritage-listed archaeological site of a former hospital and private cemetery at the corner of Bluebell Road East and Gernich Road, Tinana, Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1883 to 1888. It is also known as Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site, South Sea Islander Hospital and Cemetery site, and Pacific Islander Hospital, Maryborough. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2017.
History.
The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site at Tinana, formerly named the Pacific Islander Hospital, Maryborough, and originally comprising , is situated between Iindah, Genrich and Bluebird Roads, at Tinana, approximately southwest of Maryborough. The hospital officially opened on 19 December 1883 and closed on 31 December 1888. One of only four central hospitals built for the treatment of South Sea Islanders (then called Pacific Islanders or Polynesians), the site is a rare and important remnant of the response by the Queensland Government during the 1880s to the high death rate among indentured South Sea Islanders. The former "Polynesian Cemetery" site has the potential to yield new information that will contribute to a greater understanding of the role and treatment of indentured South Sea Islander workers in Queensland's history. The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site has a special association with South Sea Islanders who, as indentured workers, made an important contribution to the establishment of the Queensland sugar industry, and has a special association with their descendants.
The settlement of Maryborough in the traditional country of the Butchulla people, started in 1847 to serve the needs of the pastoral settlers in the district. Maryborough, with a population of 299, was declared a township in 1851. It was proclaimed a port of entry in 1859 and a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) in 1861. From April 1861, land on the Mary River was sold for agricultural purposes, and by the end of the 1860s thousands of free immigrants had entered Queensland through the Port of Maryborough. Supplying the Gympie goldfields from 1867 further boosted Maryborough's growth.
Sugar cane was cultivated around Maryborough from the late 1860s. The first commercially viable sugar cane crop in Australia had been grown by Captain Louis Hope on his Ormiston House Estate at Ormiston, Queensland in 1862 and by 1864 he had established the first commercial sugar mill in Australia. Cultivated primarily on plantations, sugar cane production spread rapidly to coastal areas to the north, such as Maryborough, Mackay and Bundaberg, where the warmer climate proved more suitable.
A labour shortage existed in Queensland at the time and it was believed that labouring in the tropics was unhealthy for Europeans. Therefore, an inexpensive, non-European labour force was sought by cane plantation owners (planters). The use of South Sea Islander labour in Australia began in the 1840s when Benjamin Boyd employed them as shepherds in lieu of convict labourers in the Riverina District of New South Wales. The first group of South Sea Islanders brought to Queensland as indentured labour arrived at Brisbane on 14 August 1863 aboard Robert Towns' ship the "Don Juan", and went to work on his cotton plantation, Townsvale (later Veresdale), on the Logan River. Captain Claudius Whish employed Islanders on his Oaklands property near Caboolture, as did Captain Louis Hope on his sugar plantation at Ormiston, near Cleveland.
South Sea Islanders made a major contribution to Queensland's early sugar industry. Between 1863 and 1904, approximately 50,000 Islanders were brought to Queensland as indentured labourers, generally employed on three-year contracts bound by the current Masters and Servants Act 1861. Most came from 80 islands in Melanesia, mainly those of present day Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands. They made a vital contribution to the sugar industry by performing virtually all of the associated field work during the first phase of the sugar industry's development. Most returned to their islands at the conclusion of their contract period.
The first South Sea Islanders employed in the Maryborough district arrived in November 1867 aboard the schooner "Mary Smith", a month after the Gympie gold rush commenced. Most of this group of 84 men became employees of the Maryborough Sugar Company. The cost to employers of their travel to Maryborough was approximately £9 and their wages were £6 per annum (compared with wages for a European of £6 per month).
By March 1868, 2107 Islanders had been brought to Queensland, and were employed in various capacities including agricultural and pastoral work, and as servants in the towns. They lived and worked from Bowen to the Moreton Bay district, and west to Roma.
The need to protect South Sea Islanders from illegal practices became apparent soon after this trade in indentured labour from the islands arose. By 1868, there were reports that the recruitment of South Sea Islanders had devolved into kidnapping (known as blackbirding). At the least, there was coercion and deception involved in their hiring. The Polynesian Labourer Act 1868 was enacted to regulate recruitment. Under the Act, a government agent accompanied each recruiting ship to ensure all the regulations referred to in the Act were upheld, the Islanders were required to sign a contract for up to three years, and employers were required to pay them a minimum wage of £6 per year plus rations and pay for their return voyage home after completion of their contract. Deaths and desertions were reported to the nearest magistrate.
By 1870, sugar had become the third largest of Queensland's crops, by area of cultivation. In 1872, 56 mills in Queensland were producing more than of sugar and of rum per year, and sugar was being exported to other colonies. The labour shortage remained acute and the entire industry would have collapsed without South Sea Islanders.
During the 1870s and 1880s there was ongoing public criticism and political debate about the use of South Sea Islander labour. Further Acts of Parliament were introduced to protect the Islanders from unscrupulous recruiters and employers. Inspectors of Polynesians were appointed to monitor Islanders' health and welfare. The first Inspector appointed to oversee Bundaberg and Maryborough was employed in 1875 and also acted as the sub-collector of customs.
Concerns continued to be raised about the living and working conditions, and the illness and death rates for South Sea Islanders. Complaints were made by successive Inspectors of Polynesians at Maryborough.
In January 1876, Richard Bingham Sheridan, Inspector of Polynesians at Maryborough, reported to the Office of the Colonial Secretary that South Sea Islanders were experiencing both harsh treatment and poor living standards. He alleged that some planters were deterred from trying to diminish the death rate by the prospect of saving both the cost of the labourer's return passage and his accumulated wages if he died. As a result of Sheridan's charges, a select committee was established in September 1876 to investigate. Sheridan gave evidence about the medical neglect of the South Sea Islanders: "that medical attendance upon the Polynesians was greatly neglected; that there was no system of regular medical attendance; that numbers died without any medical man". Other witnesses, who were wealthy planters and Members of Parliament, reported favourably on the conditions for South Sea Islander employees. The investigation did not result in legislation for improved conditions.
Following Sheridan's resignation, Charles Horrocks became Inspector of Polynesians for Bundaberg and Maryborough from 1877. He regularly inspected South Sea Islander accommodation and clothing, and weighed their food rations. Instances of large numbers of Islanders dying on individual farms were investigated, with the worst examples being Robert Cran's Maryborough plantations of Yerra Yerra, Yengari and Irrewarra. In 1879, the death rate amongst South Sea Islanders in the Maryborough district was 7.4%, compared with 0.9% for similarly aged European men between 16 and 30 years. During the previous five years, Cran's estates had a mortality rate of 9.2%.
On 12 February 1880, the subsequent Inspector of Polynesians at Maryborough, Henry Reginald Buttenshaw, reported that Cran &amp; Co's properties had an exceedingly high death rate. On visiting the properties Yerra Yerra and Irrewarra, he found 60 Islanders ill with dysentery. Buttanshaw cited how local sugar planters benefitted financially by the death of an indentured worker.
The high mortality rate led to another medical investigation in 1880 when the Colonial Secretary, Arthur Hunter Palmer, ordered a departmental investigation into conditions in the Maryborough district. This was conducted by Drs Wray and Thomson who meticulously investigated the situation. They inspected Cran &amp; Co's plantations and seven other estates in the area for comparative purposes. Their report blamed poor food, long working hours, polluted water, and a lack of proper care for the sick, for the high death rate.
The doctors advised of "an urgent necessity for a complete and efficient system of inspection" at all levels. Their recommendations included "the speedy erection of a Central Polynesian Hospital in each district, presided over by a qualified medical practitioner". Horrocks, who had suggested this system three years earlier, had also devised the means for its financing, through a fee paid annually by employers for each indentured South Sea Islander, with the wages of deceased servants likewise diverted into public funds.
The resultant new Act, the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1880 set limitations on the age of recruits; their living conditions; medical service and ration provisions; and the work they could undertake. Islanders could only be employed in tropical or sub-tropical agriculture, including the cultivation of sugar cane, cotton, tea, coffee, rice and spices. This Act made medical care for South Sea Islanders compulsory and made provision for the construction of central hospitals, sponsored by the government and financed by the planters and other masters. However, it took another three years for the first central hospitals, the Pacific Islander Hospitals at Mackay and Maryborough, to be constructed.
Organisations outside Queensland also complained about the high death rate for South Sea Islanders. In 1879 the Aborigines' Protection Society had contacted the Colonial Office directly about the excessive death rate for South Sea Islanders in Queensland. In 1883 The British Medical Journal cited the Queensland Registrar-General's annual report, which revealed that the death rate of South Sea Islanders was twelve times that of Europeans of the same age group, and requested investigation of the cause by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.
The period 1881 to 1884 marked the peak of the plantation system of growing sugar cane. In 1881, there were 6396 South Sea Islanders living in Queensland. Of these, 1515 (23.69%) lived in the Maryborough and Wide Bay census district, comprising 1163 adult males, 55 adult females, and 269 male and 28 female minors.
Two central hospitals for South Sea Islanders, called Pacific Islander Hospitals, were built in 1883. They were funded by the Queensland Government, planters and other masters (all of whom paid 10s per South Sea Islander employee per annum to the Pacific Islander Fund, as stipulated by the Pacific Islander Labours Act 1880). The first hospital opened was located at Mackay, the district with the largest South Sea Islander population. The second hospital was built at Tinana outside Maryborough. The Mackay Pacific Islander Hospital was reportedly "a good building, with large airy wards, on the same plan as, only larger than, the Maryborough hospital, and capable of carrying from 300 to 400 boys [sic]". Two more Pacific Islander Hospitals opened , at Geraldton (now Innisfail) and Ingham Hospitals, both comprising separate "Kanaka ward" wings attached to the main hospital building, and with comparatively high bed densities.
The Pacific Islander Hospital for the Maryborough district was established at Tinana in late 1883. Specifications had been drawn up by the Department of Public Works in July 1882 and tenders for building the hospital and a resident surgeon's residence were called soon afterwards. The hospital buildings, chimneys and tanks were constructed during 1883 by contractor, Henry Neale, for £2762 10s. Its construction progressed slowly because of a shortage of timber. However, building was nearing completion in November 1883 when its first Resident Surgeon, Dr Charles H Clarkson, arrived to take charge of the facility. The hospital opened officially on 19 December 1883, although Clarkson had already admitted some cases.
The hospital was sited on a site at Tinana bounded by Iindah Road and two unnamed roads to its west and north. It was intended to provide care for 50 patients. The hospital complex, at the time of its construction, comprised a hospital building and a doctor's residence, built on the most elevated part of the site. The hospital building was specified as being built of ironbark or similar, supported by tarred ironbark or bloodwood timber stumps, and covered by a galvanised iron roof. The hospital building comprised two wards, a dispensary and a detached kitchen wing, connected by a covered way. The doctor's residence, along with its detached kitchen wing and covered way, was built of similar materials, and located about to the west of the hospital building. Concrete footings for the brick chimneys (hospital, residence and residence kitchen) and boiler mounts (2x boilers in hospital kitchen) were specified as being deep, with an embedded sheet of 24-gauge galvanised iron to receive the brickwork above. Both the hospital and residence buildings had separate earth closets (locations unknown) and eight water tanks on timber stands.
Soon after taking up his position, Clarkson reported to the Colonial Secretary on the building and made recommendations for improvements to it and the grounds, and about furniture needed for the hospital's efficient functioning. Due to the necessity for isolation of violent or contagious cases, more rooms were needed than provided in the building's current configuration.
Clarkson recommended clearing the thick timber that surrounded the buildings, and constructing: a two-rail fence on the three lines of road that bounded the site; a picket or light galvanised iron fence to divide the house from the main hospital buildings; and trelliswork around portions of the verandah for privacy. He regarded the hospital's eight water storage tanks as inadequate to supply the probable number of patients. Furthermore, the tanks' overflow travelled under the hospital building, which was wasteful and detrimental to patients' health. He recommended that the hospital be connected to mains water from the Tinana waterworks on Teddington Road, about away, at a cost of about £180 per mile. This water supply would also enable firefighting. Clarkson also required; to be sited "at a distance from the building: a washing shed; a four-stalled stable and shed; and a "dead house" [morgue] with [a] Zinc and Iron-lined table". The Colonial Secretary or his delegate marked these additional building requests as approved on Clarkson's report. Temporary sheds for washing were under construction by assistant wardsmen in December 1883.
Clarkson also pointed out to the Colonial Secretary "the necessity for the reservation of a piece of land as [a] Cemetry [sic]. The Maryboro General Cemetry [sic] being six miles distant...". A year earlier, the Tinana Divisional Board had proposed a cemetery reserve adjacent to the Polynesian Hospital, but a suitable site could not be decided upon. As the Pacific Islander Hospital neared completion, the local Inspector of Polynesians (Thomas B Smyth) was arranging for "the provision of a cemetery to bury the remains of those who die" at the Pacific Islander Hospital. A reserve for "Polynesian Cemetery" R314 was created in the northeast corner of the site and appeared on later survey plans and maps. This implies that the reserved site was used for burials while the hospital was operating and a cemetery reserve was created after the hospital's closure to protect those burials.
In December 1883, Clarkson reported to the Colonial Secretary that he had appointed the staff for the hospital. These were: one married wardsman at £70 a year to commence his duties from 1 January 1884; two assistant wardsmen at 20s a week; and three South Sea Islander wardsmen, one at 12s per week and the others at 10s a week. The men were employed at the time in cutting firewood, making necessary alterations, filling up the closets, and building temporary sheds for washing and so forth. Clarkson also advised that he had engaged a carpenter at 40s per week to subdivide the ward and to make the necessary fittings - table and other furniture. On 2 February 1884 Clarkson advised that the subdivision of the wards was nearly completed, but the stable and dead house (morgue) and various internal fittings remained to be done. He had also added four additional tanks instead of the proposed underground tank, and reported that "necessary drainage will give a supply to a natural water course which exists about the middle of the paddock and the labour mostly of our wardsmen will as soon as the clearing is finished be able to turn it into a water hole available for the paddock and also for supplying water for washing purposes".
Illness was still very common among South Sea Islanders at this time. Clarkson's March 1884 report stated that due to the prevalence of dysentery and malarial fever there had been a large increase in the number of admissions, as well as a comparatively high death rate, with eight deaths that month. Clarkson was transferred to the Mackay Pacific Islander Hospital in April 1884 and replaced at Maryborough by Dr J Raphael Joseph.
Water supply continued to be a concern. By November 1884, the Committee of Management of the hospital resolved to request that the government have water connected from Tinana, noting the insufficient supply from only 12 tanks containing each and that "the open waterhole that was made is unfit for use, even scrubbing purposes, the water going into it being contaminated with the worst kind of filth viz the washings from the Hospital itself". Tenders were invited for drainage work at the Polynesian Hospital, closing 2 January 1885, which was undertaken by A Brown for approximately £197. By 8 December, water pipes connecting the hospital to Tinana Waterworks were laid but the water pressure was very low.
Other improvements on the site were made soon afterwards. In January 1886 a carpenter was engaged in the erection of a stable, coach house, wash-house, bath and an ornamental paling fence around the doctor's residence. Stables were confirmed on the hospital site by April 1886.
Regulation of the hospital's procedures occurred in 1885. By-Laws for the hospital, established by the Colonial Secretary's Office, Brisbane, and in effect by 12 August 1885, specified requirements for a range of processes and activities including Committee of Management meetings and inspections, hospital visitation, reporting and burials. Forms were provided, to be completed for the notification of admissions, discharges and deaths. According to the hospital by-laws, patient burials were to be conducted by the hospital staff, with a permanent staff member required to sign the burial report. This change was reflected in the death register from August 1885 onwards.
In January 1886, all members of the Hospital Committee of Management resigned in protest against the Resident Surgeon's over-expenditure and unwillingness to reduce costs. The Committee was also concerned by the death rate at the hospital, reporting that the number of South Sea Islander deaths in the Maryborough district had risen, despite the hospital, from 77 in 1883; to 105 in 1884; to 122 in 1885.
In March 1886, Dr Joseph, the Resident Surgeon, faced a board of enquiry charged with five offences concerning the running of the hospital - primarily inappropriate use of hospital resources and staff. The charges included: using the night wardsman as a gardener in the doctor's private garden while an Islander performed the function of night wardsman; falsification of the patients' death rate to lessen the figure; often neglecting patients for up to a week, leaving a wardsman to do his work; and taking items from the hospital store for his private use.
The enquiry was inconclusive and no new legislation was enacted, but it did reveal that the doctor was abusing his position, although there was no evidence he falsified the death rate. Dr Joseph was dismissed by the Queensland Government in April 1886 and Dr David Watkins O'Connor, the local Health Officer, officiated at the hospital until the appointment of Dr Francis Bowe as the Resident Surgeon in May 1886.
Meanwhile the number of South Sea Islanders in the Maryborough district continued to reduce due to falling sugar prices and new legislation to limit inexpensive South Sea Islander labour and to break up large plantations into small holdings. An amendment to the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1880 banned South Sea Islanders from a range of work, and restricted them to menial jobs in agriculture and the Pacific Islanders Act 1885 sought to end the recruitment of South Sea Island labour by 1890. At 31 December 1886 there were 759 indentured employees (of a total of 10,165 in Queensland), down from 1215 adults in 1881. Through 136 arrivals, 53 deaths and 254 departures, it was estimated that the number of South Sea Islanders in the district would be 563 by 31 December 1887. By 1891 this number of South Sea Islanders working in the Maryborough district had reduced to 120, out of a total of 9478 in Queensland.
In 1887, Arthur Woodward, Inspector of Pacific Islanders and Officer-in-Charge of The Pacific Islander Labour Office, reported upon the Financial Condition of the Pacific Islanders' Hospitals, and recommended that all the Pacific Islander Hospitals be closed because the cost of running them would exhaust the Pacific Islanders' Fund, which paid for them, by 31 December 1887. Maryborough's deficit was estimated to be £6749 by the end of December 1887 and the other hospitals were also in debt. Woodward reported that while The Pacific Islanders Fund, was in credit for £2871 3s 11d, the four Pacific Islander Hospitals (Maryborough, Mackay, Ingham, and Johnstone) were in deficit of £19,079 16s 5d, estimated to increase to over £21,263 by 31 Dec 1887.
No action was taken until Woodward's report for the following year repeated his advice. The Maryborough and Mackay Pacific Islander Hospitals closed on 31 December 1888. Subsequently, the "Kanaka Ward" at Geraldton (Innisfail) Hospital and the "Kanaka Ward" at Ingham Hospital, which had opened , closed in December 1890. Of these four Pacific Islander Hospitals, only the Maryborough one had an adjacent "Polynesian Cemetery" reserve and has not been totally developed in 2017; with the Mackay, Geraldton and Ingham sites operating as modern hospital complexes.
After the closure of the central Pacific Islander Hospitals, South Sea Islanders were cared for in separate wards established at general hospitals, or were cared for at their plantations. Maryborough sugar planters had met in January 1889 to decide how to care for their sick South Sea Islander workers and resolved to approach the Maryborough General Hospital and to petition the government to have portions of the Polynesian Hospital building, and its furniture, shifted to the Maryborough Hospital, as a separate ward, because the Maryborough people did not wish to have "the coolies mixed with the whites" at the hospital. Subsequently, in 1889, part of the Pacific Islander Hospital building at Tinana was removed and established at the Maryborough General Hospital as a "Polynesians" ward'.
Meanwhile, a large quantity of furniture and stores from the Pacific Islander Hospital, Maryborough was sold by auction at the Immigration Depot.
A survey plan of the site from 1891 shows the hospital building and adjacent doctor's residence located in the northwest corner of Lot 5 of Section 130 and orientated parallel to the northern lot boundary (later Bluebell Road). A waterhole is located to the southwest of the residence, which was surrounded by a square, fenced garden area, and was accessed via a made road that had a gated entrance on Iindah Road to the south. The Polynesian Cemetery Reserve, R.314, is identified as a area to the northeast of Lot 4 of Section 130.
In March 1892, the remaining buildings were inspected for disposal, and a more detailed plan of the extant, and recently removed, structures was prepared. The hospital building comprised a long central ward, with north and south-facing verandahs and double-sided chimneys at either end; flanked by wings to the east (ward with partitions at northern end) and west (partitioned to form several rooms), each with verandahs that had enclosures (possibly lavatories) at the northern end. The detached hospital kitchen, which was connected to the northern verandah of the central ward by a covered way, had a south-facing verandah and contained three rooms, the largest central room with a chimney flanked by boilers. The residence comprised a square core of four rooms, the sitting room containing a chimney, with verandahs to the east, south and west (enclosed bathroom at northern end); and had a detached two-room kitchen to the north that contained a chimney and was connected by a covered way.
The disposal report noted that a portion of the hospital building (west wing), down-piping and guttering, all 12 tanks and stands, the roof of the covered way, and kitchen and ward partitions, had been removed. The residence was recommended for reuse as a police station at Tinana, and was subsequently rebuilt at Gympie Road for that purpose. The cladding used for the verandah enclosures matches that of the detached kitchen. Material from the hospital building was used for the associated police cell built on the Tinana Police Station site.
A total of 363 patients died at the Pacific Islander Hospital, Maryborough between 1883 and 1888. Prior to the establishment of Pacific Islander Hospitals, South Sea Islanders were buried on the plantations on which they worked or in the "non-Christian" or "coloured section" of general cemeteries. In January 1876, Richard Bingham Sheridan, the Inspector of Polynesians for the Maryborough district, said in his report to the office of the Colonial Secretary: "...I am led to believe that the interment of a South Sea Islander in no way differs from the burial of a dog or any other carrion. As I am informed, a hole or grave is made in the most convenient place, the body, as soon as possible after it has ceased to breathe, is rolled in the blanket in which it died, and put in the shallow resting place without further care or ceremony." While the Maryborough Cemetery does contain a small section in which South Sea Islanders were reportedly buried, there are no known records of South Sea Islander burials at the Maryborough Cemetery between 1883 and 1888. Given the distance of to Maryborough Cemetery from the Pacific Islander Hospital, it is likely that some, if not all, of the deceased patients were buried in the adjacent Polynesian Cemetery Reserve.
The Pacific Islanders Act 1885, which aimed to end recruitment, was repealed in 1892 on economic grounds. However the Pacific Island Labourers (Extension) Act 1892 further barred South Sea Islanders from construction work on plantation roads and tramways. Nevertheless, the plantation system was gradually supplanted by the central mill system serving small cane farms worked by European labour.
After Federation in 1901, two pieces of Australian Government legislation put an end to the South Sea Islander labour trade: the Immigration Restriction Act 1901 and the Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901. The former initiated the various policies that came to be termed the "White Australia Policy" by excluding all non-European immigrants. The latter legislation ended recruitment of South Sea Islanders from March 1904 and started their deportation after December 1906. Up to 1908, around 7000 people were deported. About 1200 were granted residency, and an estimated 1000 others stayed on in Australia without residency approval.
On 30 March 1911, Lots 4 and 5 of Section 130, the land comprising the former Pacific Islander Hospital, Maryborough (excluding the Reserve for Polynesian Cemetery), were sold to William Nichols, who was subsequently issued a Deed of Grant in September 1914. The land changed ownership a number of times thereafter. In 1972 the Reserve for Polynesian Cemetery was redesignated as Portion 134 and subsequently sold at public auction to the owners of Lots 4 and 5 in late 1972 or early 1973. In 1994, the former cemetery site and adjacent allotment to its west were reconfigured to increase the size of the former Portion 134 to .
Over time, modification of the former hospital and cemetery site has occurred, in association with various occupation and land use practices. A residence, flanked by paddocks or enclosures to the west and south, was established to the south of the former hospital buildings by 1940. The made road from the former hospital to Iindah Road was still evident, though the central portion of the alignment deviated to the west of that indicated in the 1891 survey plan. Mature vegetation in the vicinity of the residence and to the north and east of the made road had been substantially cleared. By 1957 the residence was no longer extant, and the lot containing the former cemetery reserve, and an area in the southwest corner of the site, had been substantially cleared of vegetation, the latter reportedly used as a gravel quarry. Further clearing of vegetation across the northern centre of the site was evident by 1964, along with the addition of a dam to the immediate south of the former cemetery reserve. A house was constructed on the northern side of the former cemetery reserve by 1994, and further structures, vegetation clearance and landscaping has occurred across the northern extent of the site in recent years, including a dam excavated in the vicinity of the historical waterhole.
In 2017 the former Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site comprises three allotments - Lot 1 RP880020 (east, cemetery reserve); Lot 2 RP880020 (centre); and Lot 5 M371033 (west, hospital and residence site).
Archaeological surface survey.
An archaeological surface survey of the former Pacific Island Hospital site (Lot 5 M371033 and Lot 2 RP880020 only) was undertaken in May 2017. The site was found to be heavily disturbed but some structural and artefactual traces of the former complex were identified. These were concentrated in the northwest corner of Lot 5 and included three concrete slabs that correspond with the configuration of chimney bases for the hospital building and detached kitchen, as indicated in the 1892 plan, as well as small isolated fragments and scatters of ceramic, glass, butchered bone, brick and clay pipe. The type and range of ceramics were limited but generally consistent with domestic activities, including possible high-status vitrified ceramics in the vicinity of the doctor's residence, although some of the heavy earthenware could relate to medical purposes. Two lithic artefacts and freshwater mussel shells ("Velesunio ambiguous") in the vicinity of the dam (former waterhole) could potentially predate the hospital era or relate to South Sea Islander peoples adapting traditional technologies and food sources on site. Several timber posts, generally consistent with the description of the timber rail fence erected around the hospital reserve, were observed. No historical artefacts or features were located on Lot 2, other than a timber post on the southern boundary. Overall the fragmentary and decontextualised nature of surface finds, which were difficult to accurately date, general absence of substantial building debris and apparent lack of rubbish pits, broken bottles or dense artefacts scatters that are normally found at late 19th and early 20th century occupation sites, has resulted in low (Lot 2) to moderate (Lot 5) archaeological potential.
A surface survey of Lot 1 RP880020 was not undertaken due to access restrictions. Historical records indicate that this former cemetery site has high archaeological potential. Archaeological investigations at and around the site, including the use of non-invasive methods such as ground-penetrating radar, have the potential to clarify the presence, nature and extent of burials, which along with the identification and analysis of associated artefacts and features could address broader research questions that relate to: the treatment of deceased patients and burial practices at the hospital; mortality rates, gender and age; spatial distribution and arrangement of graves - whether patients were buried individually or communally; evidence of traditional South Sea Islander cultures in burial practices; comparative studies with plantation burials; and broader late 19th century social attitudes towards South Sea Islander indentured workers.
Commemoration.
The Kanaka Memorial in the Mary River Parklands, Maryborough, recognises the hard work and the sacrifices of the South Sea Islander workers to the success of Maryborough.
The hospital and cemetery site was nominated for entry in the Queensland Heritage Register in 2017 due to its importance to the South Sea Islander community and to highlight South Sea Islander history and association with the site.
Description.
The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site is located in the suburb of Tinana, across the Mary River from and approximately southwest of the Maryborough CBD. The 19th century hospital site and cemetery reserve occupied Lot 5 M371033, Lot 1 RP880020 and Lot 1 RP880020, which slope down from the northwest to southeast and are bounded by Iindah Road (south), Genrich Road (west) and Bluebell Road East (north). However, the register boundary comprises two separate areas including part of Lot 1 RP880020 (cemetery, east) and part of Lot 5 M371033 (hospital site, west).
Hospital site.
The registered former hospital site occupies in the northwest corner of Lot 5 M371033. Mature vegetation has been substantially cleared from the heavily disturbed site, with the exception of some scattered and perimeter eucalypts, and grass cover comprises thick, waist high weed species such as Blady or Kunai grass ("Imperata cylindrical") and Snake Weed ("Stachytarpheta spp.").
Visible evidence of the 19th century occupation includes three rectangular concrete chimney bases, positioned in a triangular formation and orientated roughly parallel to Bluebell Road, and isolated artefacts and scatters.
Artefacts distributed across the hospital site are generally highly fragmented, comprising scatters and small isolated pieces of ceramic (predominately domestic, with traces of possible medical earthenware), glass, butchered bone, brick and clay pipe. Artefacts in the vicinity of the dam (former waterhole), to the southwest of the chimney slabs, include stone tools and freshwater mussel shells (Velesunio ambiguous).
Cemetery.
The historical cemetery reserve comprises in the northeast corner of Lot 1 RP880020, and the register boundary covers the northern of the lot, which includes a buffer to the west and south to account for the potential for burials and other subsurface features to exist outside the reserve.
The lot has been developed as a private residence, with a house, sheds, lawn areas and landscaped gardens to the north, bamboo along the western boundary, and a modern dam surrounded by various eucalypts to the south.
Heritage listing.
Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 27 October 2017 having satisfied the following criteria.
The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.
The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site (1883–88), located at Tinana, is important in demonstrating the response by the Queensland Government during the 1880s to the high death rate among indentured South Sea Islanders employed in Queensland's important sugar industry. As the site of one of only four "central hospitals" built exclusively for the treatment of South Sea Islanders; and one of the two not attached to a general hospital, it is a rare and important remnant of this government initiative.
The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history.
As a rare example of a "Polynesian Cemetery" reserve attached to a 19th-century Pacific Islander Hospital, the place has the potential to yield new information that will contribute to a greater understanding of the role and treatment of South Sea Islanders in Queensland's history.
Archaeological investigations at and around the former cemetery reserve could clarify the presence, nature and extent of burials, which along with the identification and analysis of associated artefacts and features could address broader research questions include: the treatment of deceased patients and burial practices at the hospital; spatial distribution and arrangement of graves; evidence of traditional South Sea Islander cultures in burial practices; comparative studies with plantation burial practices; and broader late 19th century social attitudes towards South Sea Islander indentured workers.
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site has a special association with Queensland's South Sea Islander community, who are descendants of those who came to Queensland as indentured labourers between 1863 and 1904. Now an archaeological site, it represents the loss of South Sea Islanders to illness and injury as a result of their labour to establish and develop the Queensland sugar industry.
The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history.
The Pacific Islander Hospital and Cemetery site has a special association with the South Sea Islanders who, as indentured workers, made an important contribution to the establishment and development of the Queensland sugar industry. Over approximately 35 years, thousands of South Sea Islanders worked in the Maryborough district, and 1964 were admitted to the Pacific Islander Hospital at Tinana; where 363 died.

Buonsignori Map

The Buonsignori Map (Italian - "Pianta del Buonsignori" or "Carta del Buonsignori") was an axonometric map of the city of Florence, produced as an etching in 1584 and later reissued in 1594. It was drawn by and named after the Olivetan monk Stefano Buonsignori, etched by Bonaventura Billocardi and edited by Girolamo Franceschi. One of the 1594 copies belongs to the Museo di Firenze com'era and hangs in the local history rooms at the Palazzo Vecchio. Its full Latin name is "Nova pulcherrimae civitatis Florentiae topographia accuratissime delineata" (New map of the fairest city of Florence, the topography most accurately delineated).
Buonsignori was official cartographer and cosmographer to Francesco I and Ferdinand I. He produced the map from using the view from his monastery on Monte Oliveto, a viewpoint also used by the contemporary Pianta della Catena. The first edition of 1584 was dedicated to Francesco I and the 1594 edition included several new constructions, such as the Fountain of Neptune, the Equestrian Monument of Cosimo I in piazza della Signoria and the first fortifications of what would become the Belvedere.

Makkal Needhi Maiam

The Makkal Needhi Maiam (; MNM) is an Indian regional political party in the state of Tamil Nadu and union territory of Puducherry. The party was founded by Kamal Haasan at Madurai on 21 February 2018. He also unveiled the party flag. The flag is symbolised by six interlocked hands, meant to represent co-operation between the Southern states of India (5 States and 1 UT). Their election symbol is a battery torchlight.
Makkal Needhi Maiam has also launched a mobile whistleblower application named ‘Maiam Whistle’, open to the public. This party is estimated to have around 5,500 office bearers at present. R. Mahendran quit the party stating that the party was functioning in an "undemocratic manner."
Vice-President.
Dr. Kamal Haasan, the President of the Makkal Needhi Maiam party, appointed Mr. A.G. Mourya IPS (Retd) and Mr. Thangavelu as Vice-President of Makkal Needhi Maiam party in 2021.
State Secretaries list.
Dr. Kamal Haasan announced new executives of Makkal Needhi Maiam party on 26 June 2021. 
2019 Lok Sabha Election.
For 2019 Indian general election he declared to contest on 40 seats included 39 of Tamil Nadu and 1 of Puducherry.
Initially, there was speculation that Kamal Haasan could ally with the Congress after the state Congress chief had hinted at it. A few days ago, a lesser known Republican Party of India had forged an alliance with the MNM.
Releasing the party manifesto and the second list of candidates of his Makkal Needhi Maiam or MNM at a function in Coimbatore, Mr Haasan said, "All candidates are my faces. I am proud being the chariot puller than being in the chariot".
Makkal Needhi Maiam's vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha election was 3.72% (in the seats it contested). Makkal Needhi Maiam secured 1,613,708 votes of the 4,20,83,544 polled in Tamil Nadu. J. Ebenezer, who contested from the Kanyakumari constituency secured the fewest votes at 8,590 while the MNM vice-president Dr. R.Mahendran contesting from the Coimbatore constituency secured the highest number of votes by the party at 1,45,104. The party performed well in urban areas such as Chennai, Coimbatore and Madurai, where it regularly polled upwards of 8.5% to 12.5% of the vote share and often secured more than one lakh votes, but it performed poorly in rural areas. Despite this, all the candidates lost their deposit.
Makkal Needhi Maiam candidates lost their deposit in all the seats it contested in the 2019 Indian general election but they came third in many urban constituencies through it fell behind the Naam Tamilar Katchi in several rural constituencies and Amma Makkal Munnettra Kazagam in some constituencies behind the DMK and AIADMK fronts came first or second in all constituencies.
2021 Tamil Nadu Assembly Election.
On 13 December 2020, Haasan launched MNM's election campaign for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, running candidates in 142 assembly constituencies and committing that he would not form an alliance with either DMK or AIADMK. MNM failed to win any seat in the election, with Haasan himself losing to BJP's Vanathi Srinivasan in the Coimbatore South Assembly constituency by 1728 votes.

Shining Resonance Refrain

Shining Resonance Refrain is a Japanese role-playing game developed by O-Two Inc. and published by Sega. Originally developed by Media.Vision, it is an entry in Sega's "Shining" series of video games, and an expanded and remastered version of the Japan-only Shining Resonance released for the PlayStation 3 in 2014. While the original PS3 release was not translated into English, "Refrain" was released in July 2018 for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One platforms.
Gameplay.
The game plays as a traditional Japanese role-playing game with action-based battles, similar to the "Tales" series of video games. Interactions by the player made between the main character and other playable characters affect player's "relationship level"; talking while resting or camping initiates special story scenes, which in turn can lead to dating scenes the following day.
Plot.
The game follows Yuma Ilvern, who holds the Spirit of the Shining Dragon, an ancient Dragon who died in an ancient war. At the start of the game, Yuma is held captive in Gaelritz Prison with an attempted rescue mission by Sonia Blanche and Kirika Towe Alma on the way. After a confrontation with Excella Noa Aura and her three spears, Yuma summons the Blade of the Shining Dragon, the Vanderhorn. They then manage to escape on the back of the Shining Dragon after Yuma transformed into him and return to Marga, the capital of Astoria. When he wakes up back as Yuma, he joins Astoria in their war against the Empire alongside the Dragoneers and the Princess of Astoria in an attempt to achieve peace for their people.
Development and release.
The game was announced in May 2014 as "Shining Resonance", as the newest title in Sega's "Shining" series. The game was developed by Media.Vision, and featured illustrations by longtime series character artist Tony Taka. The game received a Japan-only release later in the year on the PlayStation 3. In November 2017, a remaster, "Shining Resonance Refrain", was announced for PlayStation 4. The remaster was at 90% complete at the time of the announcement, and while an English language release was not announced, Sega did note that they were considering a worldwide audience for the series, a departure from most of the recent entries in the series, which had stayed in Japan. In February 2018, Sega announced that the game would receive an English language release of the PS4 version, and that an additional release would be made for the Xbox One and Nintendo Switch platforms. The game was released in July 2018.
The remastered version on PlayStation 4 and Switch contain multiple new additions to the core of the original PS3 game. The game contains a "Refrain Mode" which tells a new "what-if" side story separate from the main story. It does not need to be unlocked - it is available prior to even starting the main game, though the developers state that while the side story doesn't affect the main story, it makes more sense if the main game is played first. Two additional party members, Excela and Jinas, are added as well; they were present in the prior game, but not playable. Over 150 pieces of downloadable content (DLC) from the PS3 game are included in the remaster as well.
Reception.
"Shining Resonance Refrain" received mixed reception, according to review aggregator Metacritic. The PlayStation 3 version of the game was the fifth best-selling game in its release week in Japan, selling approximately 67,000 copies.

John Phillpotts (land agent)

John Phillpotts (1743-1814) was a landowner and entrepreneur chiefly noted as the father of Henry Phillpotts, a controversial Bishop of Exeter.
Biography.
John Phillpotts inherited the Sonke estate in Llangarron, Herefordshire, in 1769 when his father died. The estate had been in the ownership of the Phillpotts family since the mid sixteenth century.
In 1770 Phillpotts moved to Bridgwater in Somerset where he acquired a brick and tile factory. The following year he married a local woman, Elizabeth Everard. This marriage ended prematurely with Elizabeth’s death just over twelve months later; no children had been born. In 1773, at the age of thirty, John married again. His new bride, Sibella Glover, was ten years younger than he and came from a well-off Somerset family.
In 1782 Phillpotts sold his brick factory and moved with his family to Gloucester where he purchased the Bell Inn and secured for himself the office of Land Agent to the Dean and Chapter of Gloucester Cathedral. He was registered as a freeman of the City of Gloucester on 28 September 1782. He acquired this status "by fine", i.e. on payment of a fee, the standard fee at that time being twenty pounds. In 1791 Phillpotts cut himself off from his rural origins by selling the Sonke. He sold off the Bell Inn in the same year.
John and Sibella Phillpotts had many offspring. According to one obituary notice Sibella Phillpotts had borne a total of twenty-four children, but registration details have only been found for fifteen. Only six of the children reached adulthood, two daughters and four sons.
The eldest son, John Phillpotts (1775-1849), became a well known figure in local politics in Gloucester. The second son, Henry Phillpotts (1778-1869), became a prominent bishop. Thomas Phillpotts (1785-1862), the third surviving son, became a West Indies merchant with property in Gloucester Quays. The youngest son, George Phillpotts (1794-1853), served in the British Army; he died whilst serving as Acting Governor of Bermuda.
After the death of the elder John Phillpotts in 1814 his widow Sibella and the two surviving daughters remained living at their house in Parker’s Row (nowadays Brunswick Road) in Gloucester. The daughters never married, but devoted themselves to good works for the people of Gloucester.
The younger daughter, Isabella Phillpotts (1790-1825), was known as “the angel of the prisons”. She died aged thirty-four. Sibella Phillpotts herself died in December 1833. The remaining daughter, Susanna Phillpotts (1779-1837),died not long afterwards.
John and Sibella Phillpotts, Susanna and Isabella are all buried in the family vault inside St Mary de Crypt Church, Southgate, Gloucester.

The movie also portrays how Sethumadhavan who marries Meenukutty deals with her manic adoration of Mohanlal which leads to several embarrassing life events for him like how she acts like a madwoman when she goes to see Ravanaprabhu movie whereby earning the utmost respect of the regional Mohanlal fans club members, or how she advises a girl to meet her boyfriend because Mohanlal did it in one movie and Sethu had to deal with parents ire. There are hilarious scenes of her attacking both verbally and physically anyone who complains about Mohanlal movies. She becomes pregnant with a child which is a long cherished dream of Sethu and his family but a late night trip to watch a movie followed by a bike accident on the way back leads to the miscarriage of the child which breaks both Meenu and Sethu's hearts and Sethu relocated from his home village to the city by getting a transfer from his bank job in the village to a branch in the city.
There they meet several colourful characters in the colony and other hilarious scenes occur related Meenukutty's Mohanlal addiction. The climax of the movie shows Meenukutty being duped by one of the residents of the colony who claims to be a scriptwriter for a Mohanlal movie who takes advantage of Meenukutty's manic addiction to Mohanlal and convinces her to give him all her gold and any money to help her become a producer for a Mohanlal movie. While Meenukutty gives him all her gold ornaments she also finds a bag in the cupboard which was given to Sethu by his close friend as it contained all the money he has collected by selling everything he owned to pay back a bank loan. Meenukutty under a misunderstanding thinks the money is a surprise Sethu had hidden from her to give to Aamod to pay for the movie production and takes it and gives it to Aamod. When Sethu comes back from work and realises what Meenu has done he goes blind with anger and frustration and slaps her and tells her he does not want to live with her and even claims he was a fool to not to listen to the villagers and the doctor back home who said Meenu was not mentally well because he loved her and thought they could have a good life together.
Then he leaves the house for the railway station to die because now he will be labelled as a dishonest person and a thief and his reputation as an honest man was one of the most valuable things he had. Mr Who listens to his story and berates him for acting like a coward and tells him to learn from the lessons of Mohanlal movies and how even in situations worse than this the hero faces all his problems headstrong and succeeds in life. Sethu convinced by Mr Who leaves the station and on the way back to his home he calls the Mohanlal fans club leader tells him of a man who committed a scam in the name of Mohanlal and is on the run with the money. The enraged fans ask for a photo of Aamod from Setho in whatsapp and spread his face across social media using Mohanlal fans and eventually track him to a railway station where he is waiting for a train to escape the city.
The fans and Sethu capture him and retrieve the money. Sethu gets a call from one of his neighbours in the colony telling him to come to the hospital as Meenu has tried to commit suicide. Doctor tells Sethu that his wife is in urgent need for blood and Sethu who felt helpless once again relies on the power of the Mohanlal fan club to get many club members to come and donate blood. The doctor chides Sethu for not understanding what was the underlying cause for Meenu's love for Mohanlal and the Doctor gives Sethu his wife's suicide note where she explains to him that when she was little her father died in an accident and she was depressed and afraid of the world and Mohanlal and his movies gradually helped her become normal in his and that he was the light which helped her come out of her darkest moment in her childhood. Sethu feels guilty and sad for his actions. The final scenes involve Meenu waking up at the Hospital the Doctor and Sethu greet her with smiles and tells her she is fine and well but Meenu is more concerned about how the new Mohanlal film "Pulimurugan" was doing in the cinemas. The movie ends with both Meenu and Sethu along with fan club members watching "Pulimurugan" in theaters with celebrations.

Lafler v. Cooper

Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.S. 156 (2012), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court clarified the Sixth Amendment standard for reversing convictions due to ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining. The Court ruled that when a lawyer's ineffective assistance leads to the rejection of a plea agreement, a defendant is entitled to relief if the outcome of the plea process would have been different with competent advice. In such cases, the Court ruled that the Sixth Amendment requires the trial judge to exercise discretion to determine an appropriate remedy.
Anthony Cooper was charged by the State of Michigan with assault with intent to murder and three other offenses. After being incorrectly advised by his lawyer that the prosecution would be unable to prove intent to murder, he rejected a plea bargain. After being convicted at a fair trial, he appealed his conviction, arguing that his lawyer had provided ineffective assistance of counsel by advising him to reject the plea deal. Michigan courts denied him relief, but federal courts granted a writ of "habeas corpus" requiring the State to reduce Cooper's sentence to the one he would have received under the plea agreement. The State appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case.
Writing for the 5–4 majority, Justice Kennedy ruled that ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations can constitute grounds for relief if there is a fair probability that defense counsel's ineffective assistance resulted in a harsher sentence or conviction. In those cases, Justice Kennedy wrote, trial judges should exercise discretion in choosing to vacate a conviction and accept the original plea bargain, resentence the defendant, or leave the original conviction undisturbed. Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Roberts (in large part) which argued that the majority had invented a constitutional right to plea bargain. Justice Alito also wrote a dissenting opinion in which he largely agreed with Justice Scalia and specifically argued that the majority's remedy was unsound.
Reactions following the Supreme Court's ruling were mixed, with some commentators praising the Court's recognition of the role of plea bargaining in criminal justice and others criticizing the implications of not sufficiently protecting defendants' rights and of requiring defense counsel to plea bargain at the desire of the prosecutor.
Background.
Ineffective assistance of counsel.
The Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that:
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence."The Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to require states to provide indigent criminal defendants with counsel. In "Strickland v. Washington", the controlling Supreme Court decision on ineffective assistance of counsel, the Court ruled that simply having "a person who happens to be a lawyer [...] present at trial alongside the accused [...] is not enough to satisfy the constitutional command". The "Strickland" Court determined that a conviction may be reversed for ineffective assistance of counsel if the defendant shows that:
Michigan trial court.
On March 25, 2003, Anthony Cooper shot Kali Mundy repeatedly under the waist, injuring (but not killing) her. Cooper was charged with assault with intent to murder, possession of a firearm by a felon, possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and for being a habitual offender. Before trial, the prosecution offered Cooper a plea bargain to dismiss two charges and recommend a sentence of 51 to 85 months on the other two in exchange for a guilty plea. Cooper expressed willingness to accept the deal and plead guilty, but later rejected the offer and went to trial. At trial, Cooper was convicted on all counts and received a sentence of 185 to 360 months' imprisonment.
Cooper later gave evidence his attorney had inaccurately advised him that he could not be convicted of assault with intent to murder because he shot the victim below the waist. The state trial court heard and rejected Cooper's motion for resentencing, not finding that his attorney's defective advice, to reject the plea agreement, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.
State court appeals.
Cooper appealed to the Michigan Court of Appeals, renewing his claim that his attorney's incorrect advice during plea bargaining constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. In a "per curiam" opinion issued on March 15, 2005, the Court of Appeals affirmed the rejection of the claim on the grounds that Cooper had "knowingly and intelligently rejected two plea offers and chose to go to trial". Cooper applied to the Michigan Supreme Court for leave to file an appeal, which it denied on October 31, 2005, "because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court".
Federal habeas proceedings.
Cooper filed a petition for a writ of "habeas corpus" in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, again renewing his claim that his attorney's advice to reject the plea agreement constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. On March 26, 2009, U.S. District Judge Denise Page Hood granted the petition, issuing a writ of habeas corpus "ordering specific performance of Petitioner’s original plea agreement, for a minimum sentence in the range of fifty-one to eighty-five months, the plea Petitioner would have accepted if counsel had been competent".
The State of Michigan appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Cooper's lawyer had not provided deficient advice, that there was no prejudice because Cooper received a fair trial, and that the District Court's "specific performance" remedy was unlawful. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order, holding that Cooper had established a "Strickland" violation and that the remedy of specific performance was proper.
Supreme Court.
The State appealed to the Supreme Court, filing a petition for "certiorari". On January 7, 2011, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, granting certiorari and directing the parties to brief and argue the following question, in addition to the question presented in the petition for certiorari: "What remedy, if any, should be provided for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea bargain negotiations if the defendant was later convicted and sentenced pursuant to constitutionally adequate procedures?"
Arguments.
For the Supreme Court's review, both parties agreed that the first "Strickland" prong had been satisfied – that is, the parties agreed that Cooper's trial counsel had performed deficiently. The central disagreement was on whether Cooper had satisfied the "Strickland" prejudice prong. The State argued that Cooper did not suffer any prejudice from his counsel's deficient performance because the Constitution does not guarantee defendants a right to a plea agreement, and that far from being prejudiced, Cooper had exercised his Constitutional right to stand trial by rejecting the plea deal. Because Cooper had received a fair trial after pleading not guilty, the State argued, Cooper's rights had not been violated.
Cooper argued that even though there is no right to a plea agreement itself, criminal defendants have the right to be assisted by competent counsel "during" plea negotiations. Accordingly, Cooper argued that criminal defendants can be prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, even if the subsequent trial was fair. Cooper also pointed out that every federal court of appeals to have considered the issue, and 25 of the 27 states to have considered the issue, agreed that counsel's deficient performance during plea negotiations can constitute "Strickland" prejudice.
In response to the Supreme Court's order directing the parties to argue what remedy would be appropriate, the State argued that no remedy was appropriate. The State wrote that courts should not order prosecutions to offer a particular plea agreement, because doing so would constitute a breach of separation of powers and the discretion inherent in the plea process. The State also argued that allowing criminal defendants any remedy would "open the floodgates to litigation by defendants seeking to unsettle their convictions". Cooper argued that allowing the defendant to accept the plea agreement was the appropriate remedy, putting the defendant in the same position as if counsel had not performed deficiently.
Opinion of the Court.
Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court on March 21, 2012. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court vacated the Sixth Circuit's opinion and remanded for further consideration. Relying on his opinion in "Missouri v. Frye", which was also decided the same day, Justice Kennedy wrote that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel extends to plea negotiations. The Court ruled that to establish prejudice and obtain relief, a defendant
must show that but for the ineffective advice of counsel there is a reasonable probability that the plea offer would have been presented to the court (i.e., that the defendant would have accepted the plea and the prosecution would not have withdrawn it in light of intervening circumstances), that the court would have accepted its terms, and that the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.
As to the remedy for ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations, the Court wrote that any remedy should be "tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interests". The Court noted that the injury from deficient counsel during plea bargaining "can come in at least one of two forms": losing a "lesser sentence" and losing the opportunity to plead guilty to "counts less serious than the ones for which a defendant was convicted after trial". In cases where the "sole advantage a defendant would have received under the plea is a lesser sentence", the Supreme Court ruled that courts should "exercise discretion in determining whether the defendant should receive the term of imprisonment the government offered in the plea, the sentence he received at trial, or something in between". When "resentencing alone will not be full redress for the constitutional injury, [...] the proper exercise of discretion to remedy the constitutional injury may be to require the prosecution to reoffer the plea proposal".
Applying those standards to Cooper's case, the Supreme Court ruled that Cooper had established that he had been prejudiced by his counsel's deficient performance. Turning to the remedy, the Court ruled that the District Court should require the prosecution to re-offer the plea deal and then decide whether to resentence Cooper.
Dissents.
Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion joined by Justice Thomas and Chief Justice Roberts (as to all but Part IV). In a rare move, Scalia read his dissent from the bench, calling the Court's holding "absurd" and "unheard-of". Scalia argued that by reversing a conviction following "a full-dress criminal trial with its innumerable constitutional and statutory limitations upon the evidence that the prosecution can bring forward, and (in Michigan as in most States) the requirement of a unanimous guilty verdict by impartial jurors", the majority transformed plea bargaining from being an embarrassing "necessary evil" to being an embraced, constitutionally-protected institution of the criminal justice system.
Justice Scalia remarked that the Sixth Amendment was designed to protect fair trials, and that errors which do not impact the fairness of a trial cannot constitute "Strickland" prejudice. He noted that the majority's remedy, which left to the discretion of the trial judge the specific relief, was unprecedented in the history of the Court's criminal justice jurisprudence. Finally, he argued that granting relief would violate the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, which prohibits federal courts from granting relief unless the state court issued a decision "contrary to, or [which] involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States".
Justice Alito also wrote a dissenting opinion, which largely agreed with Justice Scalia's analysis. Justice Alito then wrote the "weakness in the Court’s analysis is highlighted by its opaque discussion of the remedy that is appropriate when a plea offer is rejected due to defective legal representation".
Reception.
Reactions to the Supreme Court's decision were mixed. Lawyers on all sides of the issue were surprised by the broadness of the Court's ruling. An article published in the "Federal Sentencing Reporter" argued that the government had "[won] by losing" by requiring defense lawyers to "bargain at the behest of the prosecutor". The Brennan Center for Justice wrote that the decision could incentivize defense counsel to advise accepting the first plea bargain their clients are offered for fear of being labelled "ineffective" by a court deciding that rejecting the plea was disadvantageous with the advantage of hindsight, but also noted that the decision represented a "triumph of realism and justice over narrow legalism and formalism". Articles published by the "Notre Dame Law Review" and the "University of Chicago Public Law &amp; Legal Theory Research Paper Series" argued that the Court had not done enough to protect defendants' rights, while an article published in the "Mississippi Law Journal" criticized the Court for "possibly neglecting the fundamental goal of the Sixth Amendment: the right to a fair trial". The ruling was described as creating "a new body of constitutional law" and was seen as broadly impactful on all sides.

Chandrahasan

Chandrahasan (6 March 1936 — 18 March 2017) was an Indian film producer and actor from Tamil Nadu, India.
Career.
Born to advocate Srinivasan and Rajalakshmi, Chandrahasan was the second of four children. His elder brother Charuhasan and younger brother Kamal Haasan worked predominantly as actors in the film industry, while his younger sister, Nalini Raghuram, is a classical dancer. As a youngster, Charuhasan practised as a singer, before being readied for a career as a lawyer. In contrary to Charuhasan, Chandrahasan maintained a very close relationship with his younger brother Kamal Haasan throughout his successful career as an actor.
In 1995, he appeared as an actor in his niece Suhasini Maniratnam's directorial debut "Indira". The film featured his own daughter Anu Hasan in the titular role alongside Arvind Swamy and Nassar. During the 2000s, Chandrahasan took a more active role in the management of Raaj Kamal Films International. During the problems faced during the release of "Vishwaroopam" (2013), Charuhasan had taken a pivotal role in mediating with the opposition.
Prior to his death, Chandrahsan completed acting in the lead role of a film titled "Appathava Aattaya Pottutanga" by debutant director Stephen Rangaraj. A tale of romance between two older individuals, Stephen cast Chandrahasan as he wanted someone who was known as a "respectable person" and because the romance should not be conveyed in the wrong light. The film, which featured him alongside Sheela, the mother of actor Vikranth, remains unreleased.
Personal life.
Chandrahasan was married to Geethamani and has a son, Nirmal Hasan, who is settled at United States. His daughter, Anu Hasan, has appeared as an actress in Indian and British productions. 
Geethamani has died in January 2017 aged 73. Following her death, Chandrahasan has died in March 2017 aged 81.
Death.
Following a cardiac arrest, Chandrahasan died aged 81 on 18 March 2017 in London, United Kingdom. Following the death of his wife in January 2017, Chandrahasan had travelled to stay with his son Nirmal in the United States, for a change of scenery. On his return, to avoid taking a twenty three hour journey to Chennai, he had made a brief stopover in London to visit his daughter Anu. He was staying at her residence during the time of his death. The family later held a quiet funeral upon the return of his body to Chennai, before holding a remembrance meet with film industry personalities in April 2017. Apart from family, other guests included Rajinikanth, Ilaiyaraaja and Prakash Raj. Kamal Haasan later described his brother as "a father figure".

William Staniforth

William Staniforth (1749-1834) was an English surgeon, notable for being one of the first surgeons at the Sheffield Royal Infirmary.
William was the son of Samuel Staniforth (1725-1811) and Mary Ash. His brother Samuel (1747-1824) was a linen draper, and lived next door to William on Castle Street. William was well known for his Oculist business named "Staniforth's Eye Ointment". In the 1876 publication "Reminiscences of Old Sheffield: Its Streets and Its People" William is described as being 'the best operative surgeon and oculist in town'.
Staniforth retired in 1819 and died on 21 August 1833. He was buried in Attercliffe Chapel. Prior to the Infirmary being redeveloped, a medallion was placed on the wall of the Board Room.

Urusbiy

Urusbiy () is the surname of the mountain princes (Taubiy) of the Balkaria in the North Caucasus.
History.
The Urusbiy surname has its origins in one of the representatives of the Sunshevs' surname () - the Bezengi Taubies (mountain princes).
The grandson of Chepelleu, a son of Urusbiy Sunshev, left with his mother at the end of the 18th century, first to the Chegem society, where his mother came from. Having grown up and become acquainted with the neighboring Baksan gorge, he decided to leave forever. After taking his noblemen (uzdens), emcheks and serfs with their families from there, he settled in the Baksan gorge near the entrance to the gorge, near the border of the possessions of the Kabardinian princes Atazhukin, on the site called "Kamyk". Soon after the resettlement, Chepelleu received support from relatives of his mother - the Chegem princes (Taubiy). With the passage of time, the Urusbievs' surname was formed from Chepleleua and his descendants. The Urusbiy surname took the name of the father of the founder Chepleleu - Urusbiy Sunshev.

The park sits at a strategic location, adjacent to the river and at the intersection of several planned, but not constructed, multi-use trails. The trails include the Western Gwinnett Bikeway along Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, The Rogers Bridge Trail along Rogers Bridge Road and the Chattahoochee River Greenway which follows the river along the city’s northern boundary.
Amenities.
The Chattahoochee River flows along the northern boundary of the park. Approximately two-thirds of the park is an open grassy field with small wooded areas along the stream buffer and at the southern end of the park. A gravel parking lot, picnic pavilion, and playground, are the only recreational amenities in the park. The private event facility includes large open space, a small multi-use building, and a boat ramp; a city easement provides public access to the boat ramp.
Chattapoochee Dog Park.
It is the first dog park created in the city. Located on nearly three acres, the park is in the northeast section of Duluth adjacent to the Chattahoochee River.

National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy – Government of India

The Union Cabinet approved the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) on 9 February 2012. The objective of the policy is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data and information in both human readable and machine readable forms.
Scope.
A large quantum of data generated using public funds by various organizations and institutions in the country remains inaccessible to the public, although most of such data may be non-sensitive in nature and could be used by public for scientific, economic and developmental purposes. There has been an increasing demand by the community, that such data collected with the deployment of public funds should be made more readily available to all, for enabling rational debate, better decision making and use in meeting civil society needs. The NDSAP policy is designed to promote data sharing and enable access to Government of India owned data for national planning, development and awareness.
The National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) is applicable to all shareable non-sensitive data available either in digital or analog forms but generated using public funds by various ministries, departments, subordinate offices, organizations, and agencies of Government of India as well as of the states. The objective of this policy is to facilitate access to Government of India owned shareable data through a wide area network, thereby permitting a wider accessibility and usage by public. The principles on which data sharing and accessibility need to be based include: openness, flexibility, transparency, quality, security and efficiency.
The motivation behind this policy is United Nations Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, Principle 10: ""Environmental issues are best handled with the participation of all concerned citizens, at the relevant level. At the national level, each individual shall have appropriate access to information concerning the environment that is held by public authorities...and the opportunity to participate in decision-making processes. States shall facilitate and encourage public awareness and participation by making information widely available." and Right to Information Act, 2005, Section 4 (2): "It shall be a constant endeavour of every public authority to take steps in accordance with the requirements of clause (b) of sub-section (1) to provide as much information suo motu to the public at regular intervals through various means of communications, including internet, so that the public have minimum resort to the use of this Act to obtain information."". Some state governments such as Sikkim, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Odisha, Assam, etc. have created their own policy on the lines of NDSAP.
Open Government Data (OGD) Platform India.
The open government data initiative started in India with the notification of the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP), submitted to the Union Cabinet by the Department of Science and Technology, on 17 March 2012. The NDSAP identified the Department of Electronics &amp; Information Technology as the nodal department for the implementation of the policy through National Informatics Centre, while the Department of Science and Technology continues to be the nodal department on policy matters. In pursuance of the Policy, the Open Government Data Platform India was launched in 2012.
"OGD Platform India" is a platform for supporting open data initiative of Government of India. The platform has been set up to provide collated access to resources (datasets/apps) under catalogs, published by different government entities in open format. The portal is intended to be used by Government of India ministries, departments and their organizations to publish datasets, documents, services, tools and applications collected by them for public use. The base "Open Government Data Platform India" is a joint initiative of Government of India and Federal government of the United States.
The current version launched on 11 December 2014 is the stable release of the platform. After the launch of the Digital India program in 2015, "Open Government Data Platform India" has been included as one of the important initiatives under Pillar 6 – "Information for All".
Government Open Data License – India.
While appropriate open formats and related aspects for implementation of the policy has been defined in the "NDSAP implementation guidelines" prepared by an inter-ministerial task force constituted by the National Informatics Centre, the open license for data sets published under NDSAP and through the OGD Platform remained unspecified. The license Government Open Data License – India is published as an "Extraordinary Gazette" on February 2017. The license ensures that the data released are not misused or misinterpreted, and that all users have the same and permanent right to use the data.
Government Open Data License – India (GODL-India) is applicable to "all shareable non-sensitive data available either in digital or analog forms but generated using public funds by various agencies of the Government of India". The license permits anyone to "use, adapt, publish (either in original, or in adapted and/or derivative forms), translate, display, add value, and create derivative works (including products and services), for all lawful commercial and non-commercial purposes". In return, the user must acknowledge the provider, source, and license of data by explicitly publishing the attribution statement, including the DOI (Digital object identifier), or the URL (Uniform Resource Locator), or the URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) of the data concerned.
The license does not cover the following kinds of data: a. personal information; b. data that is non-shareable and/or sensitive; c. names, crests, logos and other official symbols of the data provider(s); d. data subject to other intellectual property rights, including patents, trade-marks and official marks; e. military insignia; f. identity documents; and g. any data that should not have been publicly disclosed for the grounds provided under section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005.

Stefano Bonsignori (bishop)

Stefano Bonsignori or Bonsignore O.SS.C.A. (23 February 1738, Busto Arsizio - 23 December 1826, Faenza) was an Italian cleric, bishop and theologian. Napoleon I appointed him patriarch of Venice, but this appointment was not confirmed by the Holy See.
Life.
Academic.
A son of the cotton merchant Giovanni Battista Bonsignori and his wife Giovanna Galeazzi, he began his education under an uncle who was a priest, before moving to the Archepiscopal Seminary of Milan. In 1759 he entered the oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles and was ordained priest at the end of 1760. He served as a grammar teacher at the seminaries in Celana and Gorla, then as a rhetoric and theology teacher at the main seminary in Milan and the Helvetic College. During this time he became part of the circle of scholars gathered by cardinal Angelo Maria Durini - others included count Karl Joseph von Firmian, archbishop Giuseppe Pozzobonelli and Carlo Trivulzio. He became an orator, epigraphist and church historian and in 1774 was made doctor of the Biblioteca Ambrosiana. The following year he graduated in theology from the University of Pavia.
In 1791, after the seminaries reopened following the limitations on the general seminary, he was made professor of dogmatic theology and prefect of studies, with a substantial salary. He became a noted and rich orator and theologian and in 1797 he was admitted to the prestigious Metropolitan Chapter as a canon theologian. This period of success soon stopped, however, with the founding of the Cisalpine Republic, the abolition of cathedral chapters and the confiscation of their goods. Probably thanks to contacts with politicians, Bonsignori gained a 1,200 lire pension and met Napoleon after he came to Milan following his victory at the battle of Marengo. He gained the general's sympathy and accompanied archbishop Filippo Maria Visconti to the Consulte de Lyon as an advisor.
Bishopric.
Thanks to Francesco Melzi d'Eril, vice-president of the new Italian Republic, he gained several important posts in the following years, as part of Melzi's attempts to reinstate those linked to the aristocratic world swept away by the Cisalpine Republic. In a list of names proposed as diocesan bishops in Italy, Melzi wrote by Bonsignori's name "one of ours". Whilst he waited for the 1801 Concordat to come into force, Bonsignori became a member of the Istituto Nazionale and vice-director of the Biblioteca di Brera. Only on 5 April 1806 did Napoleon nominate him to be bishop of Faenza, confirmed on 18 September 1807 by pope Pius VII. He was consecrated as a bishop by archbishop Antonio Codronchi on 27 December 1807 and on 13 March the following year took possession of his diocese.
He was one of the most pro-French bishops, albeit in a passive form, even when the First French Empire annexed the Papal States and when Pius was put under house arrest after excommunicating Napoleon. This put him at odds with Pius' attempts at resistance. He even wrote a letter to his diocese's parish priests in 1810 praising a circular by the Minister of Religion and ascribing civil marriage the same value as church marriage. He was suitably rewarded with the titles of count, baron, commander of the Order of the Iron Crown and Grand Official of the Kingdom of Italy. This culminated in Napoleon's nomination of him as Patriarch of Venice on 9 February 1811, without approval from the pope, who continued to see him as only bishop of Faenza. Bonsignori reached the Lagoon on 9 April but did not spend much time there, since on 5 May he reached Paris for a council, where he acted as secretary and made no major interventions. He was similarly passive at the later deputation of Savona between October 1811 and February 1812. In 1813 he reached Pius in his captivity at Fontainebleau, but again took no active part in the negotiations for the new concordat.
After Napoleon.
After Napoleon's first fall in 1814 Bonsignori renounced his loyalty to him and withdrew his statements about civil marriage. He left Venice on 5 May 1814 and made a sermon at Faenza Cathedral confessing his guilt. Pius then sentenced him to a year in which he was not allowed to hold pontifical masses, after which he was allowed to return to his diocese. He became a strong supporter of Pius' attempts to return to the pre-Napoleonic status quo - he rebuilt the college of urban parish priests, restored the suppressed monasteries and parishes and opened new monasteries at Bagnacavallo and at Fognano, Brisighella. He later reorganised the episcopal seminary, leaving it his collection of books and manuscripts.

Chihilsitoon (, meaning "Forty Columns"), also spelled Chehel Sutoon, Chelsutoon, Chihil Sutun or Chihilsutoon, is an area in southern Kabul, Afghanistan, part of District 7. 
History.
It is named after the Chihilsitoon Palace, a garden and pavilion that was originally built at the same location by then-Emir Abdur Rahman Khan at the end of the 19th century. Historic maps also refer to both the palace and area as "Hendaki".
The palace's commemorative plaque was set in 1888. It was expanded with paved walkways and marble fountains by his successor Habibullah Khan. It had been used at times as a state guesthouse during the 20th century, notably being the visiting residence of U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower and Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, and during the communist era, was used as a government media hub. The site was heavily damaged by civil war and laid in ruins for years, before it was fully rebuilt and reopened in 2019.
Chihilsitoon is located in the outskirts of the city's urban area, just east from the Kabul River that streams south towards Char Asiab. The Chihilsitoon Road links it towards central Kabul to the north and Darulaman to the west. Like other places of District 7, it is an unplanned area and generally poor.

Pomatodelphis

Pomatodelphis is an extinct genus of river dolphin from Middle Miocene marine deposits in Alabama, Florida, Brazil, Germany and France.
Classification.
"Pomatodelphis" belongs to the platanistid subfamily Pomatodelphininae, which is distinguished from the South Asian river dolphin in having a flattened rostrum, a transversely expanded posterior end of the premaxilla, an eye and bony orbit of normal size (not atrophied), and nasal bones not reduced in size but wide transversely. A close relative of "Pomatodelphis" is "Prepomatodelphis" from marine deposits in Austria. Three species are known, "P. inaequalis", "P. bobengi", and "P. stenorhynchus".

Grecotel

Grecotel S. A., part of N. Daskalandonakis Group, is the largest luxury hotel chain in Greece.
As of 2014, the company reported a turnover of 151 million Euro, 1.85 million lodging nights.
Grecotel has a total of 35 hotels as of 2017. Hotels in the Peloponnese and Crete operate from March to mid-November, 
the resort at Cape Sounio (Attic Riviera) is operational until late December.
N. Daskalantonakis Group, the main owner of Grecotel, is a family business, reportedly involved in 60 companies and one of Greece's largest tourism businesses.
German tour operator TUI Group acquired 50% ownership of Grecotel in 1981. 
The brothers Nikos and Takis (1931–2012) Daskalantonakis (Δασκαλαντωνάκης), olive oil traders of Rethymno, Crete, in 1976 opened their first hotel outside of Rethymno, Rithimno Beach. Other hotels in Crete followed in the late 1970s to early 1980s. They bought 50% of Grecotel from Cypriot businessman Dimitris Pierides in 1986.
In the years leading up to the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, the owners made substantial investments which however did not yield the expected results. Thus, with the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the company came into difficulties and in 2012 had to be rescued by TUI Group.
The investments specifically concerned the hotels in the historical center of Athens, which fell victim to chronic degradation in the wake of the financial crisis, turning into "immigrant ghettos" rife with crime, coinciding with a drop in lodging nights in hotels there.
Within the Daskalandonakis family, there was a prolongued legal dispute over the control of the business, sparked by the financial difficulties, lasting from 2008 to 2017. Founder Nikos Daskalandonakis and his daughter Marie Sifounakis (wife of politician Nikolaos Sifounakis) won the case against his now-ex-wife and his other two children in Supreme Court decision 1340/2017.
In 2015, TUI sold its share of the company to the private owners, the Daskalantonakis family.
There was some speculation in Greek media regarding possible disputes over further investment plans as the reason for this decision.
Vassilis Menadakis was appointed general manager in 2015, replacing George Karatzias.
Agreco Farm is a traditional farm outside Rethymno, Crete, sponsored and developed by Grecotel founder Nikos Daskalandonakis. It was awarded "Best Organic Restaurant" by "Vanity Fair" in 2009.

Jason Kuznicki is the editor of Cato Books and of "Cato Unbound", the Cato Institute’s online journal of debate. He earned his doctorate at Johns Hopkins University, where Kuznicki received a Fulbright Fellowship and a Chateaubriand Prize. Kuznicki previously worked as an assistant editor of the "Encyclopedia of Libertarianism".
Kuznicki is the author of "Technology and the End of Authority: What Is Government For?" (Palgrave, 2017). In it he suggests government and states are just one tool among many that human societies have deployed to solve various sorts of problems. Rather than focus too much on the state, Kuznicki argues we should instead focus on the real center of society, institutions such as markets, churches, sports teams, scientific schools, and families, which the state is designed to support. As a thought leader within the modern libertarian movement, Kuznicki opposes libertarian perspectives that support some of the Confederacy's philosophical underpinnings, focusing instead on the basic human freedoms of African Americans.
Contributing to the anthology "Our American Story" (2019), Kuznicki addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative and suggested that we should not idolize the past, arguing "the most important American narrative today is one that historians call a "declension narrative", and second, it's false."
Kuznicki's writing and speeches have been featured on C-SPAN, the "Federalist", and "Law and Liberty," as well as in "Liberal Currents" where he continues to publish essays.

Lake Musselshell

The basin that held Pleistocene Lake Musselshell is in the lower (north-flowing) reach of the river. It is underlain mostly by highly erodible Cretaceous Colorado shale, Montana group sandstone, siltstone and shale, and Hell Creek sandstone and shale. The bedrock is gently folded and affected by local faults and joints. There is a sequence of nine terraces and more than 100 glacial boulders. The terraces are older than the erratics as the erratics rest on the terraces.
Glacial stages.
Advancing out of Alberta a lobe of the late Wisconsin Laurentide Ice Sheet advanced southeastward into east and central Montana and southwestern Saskatchewan, leaving the Cypress Hills and Boundary Plateau unglaciated. As the Laurentide ice crossed the area of the present day Milk River valley in southern Alberta, it was divided into two lobes by the Sweetgrass Hills, which also remained unglaciated. The western lobe, the Shelby lobe, advanced southward to the Missouri River, in the vicinity of Great Falls, Montana. The lobe that extended east of the Sweetgrass Hills, the Havre lobe, moved in two directions. The Lorna sublobe, advanced across the Missouri River to north of the Highwood Mountains. The Malta sublobe expanded southeastward along the present-day Milk River, bounded to the north by the Boundary Plateau and to the south by the Little Rocky Mountains and the region of the Mussellshell River.
The Lake Great Falls provides an approximate date and southern boundary for the maximum advance of the glacial lobes into Montana, impounding the Missouri River, Yellowstone River, and Little Missouri River rivers, each valley forming a glacial lake; i.e., Lake Mussellshell, Lake Circle, Lake Jordan, Lake Lambet, Lake Glendive, and Lake Mikkelson.

Walter Arthur Copinger

Walter Arthur Copinger (14 April 1847 – 13 March 1910) was an English professor of law, antiquary and bibliographer.
Early life and education.
Copinger was born on 14 April 1847 at Clapham, the second son of Charles Louis George Emanuel Copinger and his wife Mary, widow of George James, and daughter of Thomas Pearson of Shepperton, Surrey. Educated at the private school of John Andrews at Wellesley House, Brighton, he passed to University College, Durham, but left Durham without completing his course to enter the office of a relative who was a solicitor in London. He did not remain there long. In 1866 he was admitted a student of the Middle Temple, and after spending a short time in the chambers of T. Bourdillon, a well-known conveyancing counsel, he was called to the bar on 26 January 1869. He had mastered the principal treatises of law, and especially the law of real property.
Career.
In 1870 Copinger settled in Manchester, and commenced practice as an equity draughtsman and conveyancer, and in the chancery court of the county palatine of Lancaster. His work as a conveyancer increased: he ceased to take court work and became the leading conveyancer out of London, also consulted on questions of copyright. He was a lucid legal thinker with facility in drafting, and a vivid teacher to his pupils.
After his call to the bar, Copinger turned his attention to the law of copyright, and in 1870 he published a work on the "Law of Copyright in Works of Literature and Art" (4th edit. 1904).
Copinger continued to write on legal subjects, more particularly on conveyancing. In 1872 appeared an exhaustive "Index to Precedents in Conveyancing;" and in 1875 "Title Deeds, their Custody and Production of other Documentary Evidence at Law and Equity." His "Law of Rents with special Reference to the Sale of Land in Consideration of a Rent Charge", which was written many years before, was published in 1886, in collaboration with Professor Munro. In 1876 he published "An Essay on the Abolition of Capital Punishment," which, to his amusement, was so enthusiastically received by the abolitionists that his intention to publish another pamphlet demolishing all the arguments in the first was abandoned.
In 1888 Copinger was appointed lecturer in law in Owens College, Manchester, and in 1892, on the resignation of Joseph Edwin Crawford Munro, he became professor of law, and finally dean of the faculty of law in the Victoria University. He received the Lambeth degree of Doctor of Laws from Archbishop Benson in 1889, and that of M.A. from the Victoria University in 1905. He was president of the Manchester Law Society's Library, and of the East Anglians of Manchester and District.
Copinger industriously pursued versatile interests. Besides being an expert in old property law, he was also a bibliographer and antiquarian, and took an interest in theology.
Bibliographer.
Largely owing to Copinger's efforts, supported by Richard Copley Christie, the Bibliographical Society was founded in London in 1892; he was the society's first president, and held the post for four years. His own work in the field, however, lacked accuracy.
Between 1895 and 1898 Copinger published his major bibliographical work, the "Supplement to Hain's Repertorium bibliographicum". It comprises 7000 corrections of and additions to the collations of fifteenth-century works described or mentioned by Ludwig Hain, and a list of nearly 6000 works not referred to by Hain. This work extends to upwards of 1630 closely printed double-column pages. It must be used with caution.
He contributed papers to the "Transactions of the Bibliographical Society", including a monograph on the fifteenth-century printed editions of Virgil. In 1892 he published a folio volume on "Incunabula Biblica", a bibliographical account of 124 editions of the Latin Bible printed between 1450 and 1500. At his Manchester residence, The Priory, Greenheys, he set up a small press, at which he printed for private circulation four volumes: 1. "Catalogue of the Copinger Collection of Editions of the Latin Bible", 1893. 2. "Corrections and Additions to the Catalogue of Incunabula in the Mazarin Library", 1893. 3. Reprint of Leland's "New Year's Gift to Henry VIII", 1895. 4. "On the Authorship of the First Hundred numbers of the" Edinburgh Review, 1895. Nos. 3 and 4 bear the serial title "'Bibliographiana".
Antiquary.
Copinger was interested also in genealogy, heraldry, and manorial history. In 1882 he published his "History of the Copingers or Coppingers" (new enlarged edit. 1884), in which he traces the descent of his family from the Danes in the tenth century, when they appear to have settled in Suffolk and in the south of Ireland. In his last years he concentrated on the history of Suffolk. In 1902 he issued the "History of the Parish of Buxhall", of which he was lord of the manor. Between 1904 and 1907 the "History of Suffolk as described by Existing Records" (in 5 vols.) made its appearance together with the "Manors of Suffolk: Notes on their History and Devolution" (7 vols. 1905–11). He also compiled the "History of the Smith-Carrington Family" (2 vols. 1907), which was severely criticized for its dependence upon inauthentic sources, and wrote "Heraldry Simplified", which appeared in the year of his death.
Theology.
In religion Copinger was member of the Catholic Apostolic Church, and for a number of years was the angel of the Catholic Apostolic church in Manchester; later he was angel-evangelist. His interest in theology was broad, and the work which he valued most of his own writings was a lengthy treatise from his pen on "Predestination, Election, and Grace" (1889). His other theological writings were: "Testimony of Antiquity ... being a Reprint of the Homily by Elfric", edited by himself, 1877; "Thoughts on Holiness, Doctrinal and Practical", 1883; "Contributions to Hymnody", 1886; "The Bible and its Transmission", 1897; a new translation of "Imitatio Christi", 1900; and William Law's "Serious Call adapted to the Requirements of the Present Day," 1905.
Personal life.
Copinger played several instruments, including the pianoforte and violin, and found time to compose a number of musical pieces, amongst which is a collection of seventy-five original hymn tunes. This collection, the "Contributions to the Hymnody of the Church", was first published in 1883 with thirty-five hymns in 1883 and enlarged to seventy-five hymns in 1885.
An ardent book-collector, he accumulated a considerable library. It was rich in early printed books, Bibles, manuscripts, and printed editions of the "Imitatio Christi", hymn books, Elzevirs, and general works of reference.
On 3 September 1873 Copinger married Caroline Agnes, eldest daughter of Thomas Inglis Stewart, vicar of Landscove, Devon. She predeceased him, leaving two sons and three daughters. Copinger died at his residence in Manchester on 13 March 1910 from pneumonia following an attack of influenza. He was buried at Birch, Rusholme, Manchester.
Legacy.
Copinger's collection of manuscripts is now held by the John Rylands Library, University of Manchester.

South Park (franchise)

South Park is an American multimedia animated comedy franchise created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone. It is based on the television series of the same name, developed by Brian Graden for Comedy Central.
Television series.
"South Park" is an American adult animated sitcom created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone and developed by Brian Graden for the Comedy Central television network. The show revolves around four boys—Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman, and Kenny McCormick—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular Colorado town. Much like "The Simpsons", "South Park" uses a very large ensemble cast of recurring characters and became infamous for its profanity and dark, surreal humor that satirizes a wide range of topics towards a mature audience.
The pilot episode was produced using cutout animation, leading to all subsequent episodes being produced with computer animation that emulated the cutout technique. Parker and Stone perform most of the voice acting for the show's male characters. Since 2000, each episode has typically been written and produced in the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary writer and director. There have been a total of episodes over the course of the show's 23 seasons. The show's twenty-third season premiered on September 25, 2019. A special aired on September 30, 2020.
Other media.
Films.
Theatrical film.
In June 1999, less than two years after the series first aired, a was released domestically by Paramount Pictures, with Warner Bros. handling international distribution. The film, a musical comedy, was directed by Parker, who co-wrote the script with Stone and Pam Brady. The film was generally well received by critics, and earned a combined US$83.1 million at the domestic and foreign box office. The film satirizes the controversy surrounding the show itself and gained a spot in the 2001 edition of "Guinness World Records" for "Most Swearing in an Animated Film". The song "Blame Canada" from earned song co-writers Parker and Marc Shaiman an Academy Award nomination for Best Music, Original Song.
"" was released direct-to-video in 2008 and features the three episodes from the 11th season (Imaginationland I, Imaginationland II, and Imaginationland III) merged into a compilation film.
Parker and Stone said in a 2008 interview that a theatrically released sequel would most likely be what concludes the series. In 2011, when asked on the official "South Park" website whether a sequel would be made, they said "the first "South Park" movie was so potent, we're all still recovering from the blow. Unfortunately, at the current moment, there are no plans for a second "South Park" movie. But you never know what the future may bring, crazier things have happened..." In 2011, "Time" called "South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut" the sixth greatest animated feature of all time. In 2013, Warner Bros. relinquished to Paramount its rights to co-finance a potential future "South Park" film during their negotiations to co-finance the Christopher Nolan science fiction film "Interstellar". Previous efforts to create a second "South Park" film were complicated due to both studios retaining certain rights to the property.
Paramount+ films.
On August 5, 2021, it was announced that 14 new original movies based on the series were greenlit at Paramount+, with two new movies being released yearly starting in 2021.
Shorts and sketches.
As a tribute to the Dead Parrot sketch, a short that features Cartman attempting to return a dead Kenny to a shop run by Kyle aired during a 1999 BBC television special commemorating the 30th anniversary of "Monty Python's Flying Circus". "South Park" parodied Scientology in a short that aired as part of the 2000 MTV Movie Awards. The short was entitled "The Gauntlet" and also poked fun at John Travolta, a Scientologist. The four main characters were featured in the documentary film "The Aristocrats", listening to Cartman tell his version of the film's titular joke. Short clips of Cartman introducing the starting lineup for the University of Colorado football team were featured during ABC's coverage of the 2007 matchup between the University of Colorado and the University of Nebraska. In 2008, Parker, as Cartman, gave answers to a Proust Questionnaire conducted by Julie Rovner of NPR. The Snakes &amp; Arrows Tour for Rush in 2007 used an intro from Cartman, Stan, Kyle, and Kenny preceding "Tom Sawyer". As Parker, Stone and producer Frank Agnone are Los Angeles Kings fans, special "South Park" pre-game videos have been featured at Kings home games at Staples Center, and the club even sent the Stanley Cup to visit South Park Studios after winning the 2012 finals. Parker and Stone have also created Denver Broncos and Denver Nuggets-themed shorts, featuring Cartman, for home games at Pepsi Center.
Music.
"", a compilation of original songs from the show, characters performing cover songs, and tracks performed by guest artists was released in 1998, while "Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics", a compilation of songs performed by the characters in the episode of the same name as well as other Christmas-themed songs was released in 1999, as was the to the feature film. The song "Chocolate Salty Balls" (performed by Hayes as Chef) was released as a single in the UK in 1998 to support the "Chef Aid: The South Park Album" and became a number one hit.
Video games.
Following the early success of the series, three video games based on the series were released by Acclaim Entertainment. A first-person shooter simply titled "South Park" was released in 1998 for the PC, Nintendo 64, and PlayStation. This was followed in 1999 by "", a party video game featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, "South Park Rally", a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the "South Park" games they produced.
There was a "South Park" game for the Game Boy Color in development at Acclaim but it was cancelled by Parker and Stone because they thought the game was not right for the system as the main demographic was kids. Parker and Stone have the prototype cartridge of the game, making it the first "South Park" video game ever made. Only one screenshot was published in "Nintendo Power" issue 114 in 1998. A ROM file for the game, in a complete state, was leaked online in August 2018.
Another "South Park" game was in development for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, and GameCube in 2004 but was cancelled for unknown reasons. A prototype of the game was found in an Xbox development kit in 2015.
In 2010, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new "South Park" games, that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily. The first such title is "South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!", a tower defense game developed by Doublesix, which was released in 2009 for the Xbox Live Arcade service on the Xbox 360 console. Another Xbox Live Arcade game, ', is a platformer which was released in the spring of 2012. ' is a role-playing video game that was written by Parker and Stone, and was originally scheduled to be released on March 5, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 consoles, and Microsoft Windows. The game was eventually released a year later in March 2014 to positive reviews. A sequel to "The Stick of Truth", ', was released in October 2017 with similarly good reception. A mobile game, ", was released for Android and iOS in November 2017.
Merchandising.
Merchandising related to the show is an industry which generates several million dollars a year. At the time of the show's premiere, the top-selling specialty T-shirt in the United States was based on "South Park", and US$30 million in T-shirt sales was reached during the show's first season.
A "South Park" pinball machine was released in 1999 by Sega Pinball. The companies Fun 4 All, Mezco Toyz, and Mirage have produced various South Park action figures, collectibles, and plush dolls.
Comedy Central entered into an agreement with Frito-Lay to sell 1.5 million bags of Cheesy Poofs, Cartman's favorite snack from the show, at Walmart until the premiere of the second half of the fifteenth season on October 5, 2011.

OpenSMILE

openSMILE is source-available software for automatic extraction of features from audio signals and for classification of speech and music signals. "SMILE" stands for "Speech &amp; Music Interpretation by Large-space Extraction". The software is mainly applied in the area of automatic emotion recognition and is widely used in the affective computing research community. The openSMILE project exists since 2008 and is maintained by the German company audEERING GmbH since 2013. openSMILE is provided free of charge for research purposes and personal use under a source-available license. For commercial use of the tool, the company audEERING offers custom license options.
Application Areas.
openSMILE is used for academic research as well as for commercial applications in order to automatically analyze speech and music signals in real-time. In contrast to automatic speech recognition which extracts the spoken content out of a speech signal, openSMILE is capable of recognizing the characteristics of a given speech or music segment. Examples for such characteristics encoded in human speech are a speaker's emotion, age, gender, and personality, as well as speaker states like depression, intoxication, or vocal pathological disorders. The software further includes music classification technology for automatic music mood detection and recognition of chorus segments, key, chords, tempo, meter, dance-style, and genre.
The openSMILE toolkit serves as benchmark in manifold research competitions such as Interspeech ComParE, AVEC, MediaEval, and EmotiW.
History.
The openSMILE project was started in 2008 by Florian Eyben, Martin Wöllmer, and at the Technical University of Munich within the European Union research project SEMAINE. The goal of the SEMAINE project was to develop a virtual agent with emotional and social intelligence. In this system, openSMILE was applied for real-time analysis of speech and emotion. The final SEMAINE software release is based on openSMILE version 1.0.1.
In 2009, the emotion recognition toolkit (openEAR) was published based on openSMILE. "EAR" stands for "Emotion and Affect Recognition".
In 2010, openSMILE version 1.0.1 was published and was introduced and awarded at the ACM Multimedia Open-Source Software Challenge.
Between 2011 and 2013, the technology of openSMILE was extended and improved by Florian Eyben and Felix Weninger in the context of their doctoral thesis at the Technical University of Munich. The software was also applied for the project ASC-Inclusion, which was funded by the European Union. For this project, the software was extended by Erik Marchi in order to teach emotional expression to autistic children, based on automatic emotion recognition and visualization.
In 2013, the company audEERING acquired the rights to the code-base from the Technical University of Munich and version 2.0 was published under a source-available research license.
Until 2016, openSMILE was downloaded more than 50,000 times worldwide and has established itself as a standard toolkit for emotion recognition.
Awards.
openSMILE was awarded in 2010 in the context of the ACM Multimedia Open Source Competition. The software tool is applied in numerous scientific publications on automatic emotion recognition. openSMILE and its extension openEAR have been cited in more than 1000 scientific publications until today.

Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles

The Oblates of Saints Ambrose and Charles (Latin: "Congregatio Oblatorum Sanctorum Ambrosii et Caroli") is an Ambrosian association of lay people and secular clergy in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan. Its members use the suffix 'O.SS.C.A'. It was originally based in San Sepolcro, Milan, but in 1928 moved to its present base on via Settala.
Their spirituality does not belong to any particular school, but has strong elements of the Ignatian - part of their charism is to maintain a spirituality whose marks are belonging to the diocesan clergy, obedience to the bishop and safeguarding elements of the Ambrosian Rite.
History.
It was founded as the Oblates of St Ambrose in Milan in 1578 by archbishop Carlo Borromeo, inspired by the Oratorians, although he had begun preparing for the establishment of the association as early as 1570. Its initial members were diocesan priests who made a vow of particular obedience to their bishop and of stability (ie to stay in the institution), but no vow of poverty and no vow to live in community. This formed a body of well-trained and willing volunteer oblates who the bishop could use for emergencies and other difficult tasks, principally heading seminaries and carrying out popular missionary preaching. Its constitutions were elaborations on those of Agostino Valier and the Barnabite Carlo Bascapè, then bishop of Novara. After a trial period of two years and a commission called by Filippo Neri and Felice da Cantalice, the oblates' rule was promulgated on 13 September 1581.
It was renamed in 1611 by cardinal Federigo Borromeo, who added Carlo Borromeo's name to its title. Napoleon I suppressed it in 1810 and after his fall cardinal Carlo Gaetano Gaisruck opposed reviving it. It took until 1854 for the oblates to be restored by archbishop Carlo Bartolomeo Romilli.
Structure.
The Congregation is now organised into four groups or 'families'

2017–18 FHL season

The 2017–18 Federal Hockey League season is the eighth season of the Federal Hockey League. The regular season ran from October 20, 2017, to April 7, 2018, originally scheduled for 52 games for each of the six teams. The Watertown Wolves won the playoff championship, their second championship in the league.
League changes.
The first expansion team of the 2017–18 season was announced in August 2016 as the Carolina Thunderbirds in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.
In February 2017, the FHL announced it was partnering with a developmental league called the International Developmental Hockey League (IDHL) for the 2017–18 season. It was originally intended to be focused on players between the ages of 20 to 23 who had aged out of junior leagues. At one point, the league website listed teams called the Baldwinsville Bandits, Elmira Express, Newark Diamonds, Palmyra Battalion, Syracuse Crush, and Watertown Whalers. The league held a tryout camp on June 15, 2017, for prospective players. However, on June 26, the IDHL then announced it would not play and instead purchased the Watertown Wolves when the team's local ownership group, said to be exhausted from the emotional investment in running a professional sports franchise, backed out.
After making it to the championship in the 2016–17 season, the Berlin River Drivers ceased operations due to the increased overhead costs of running the team and not selling enough season tickets for the following season. The Danbury Titans would also fold for citing overhead costs and specifically workers' compensation insurance in Connecticut.
When the schedule was released for the season, the Fighting Saints were listed with home games in Gravenhurst, Ontario, Témiscaming, Quebec, South River, Ontario, and Kingsville, Ontario. They were eventually announced to have relocated to Kingsville as the North Shore Knights. The North Shore Knights ended up rescheduling or forfeiting many home games after February 11, 2018.
The Cornwall Nationals folded during the season due to lack of funds despite sitting in second place at the time. The Nationals had played 34 games with an 18–13–3 record by their cease of operation on February 20, 2018. The five Nationals' games that were to take place against the Watertown Wolves were replaced by a travel-only team called the Northern Federals, similar to the Delaware Federals of the 2011–12 season. The Federals played the Wolves four times, all loses, including one classified as an exhibition game. All other games were immediately considered forfeits and were cancelled.

Select Committee on Overseas Trade

The Select Committee on Overseas Trade was a select committee of the House of Lords that sat from 1984 to 1985. The Committee was chaired by Lord Aldington and was described by one peer as "the most comprehensive survey of the British industrial scene since the Second World War".
Background.
During the early 1980s recession the surplus in the balance of trade had turned into a deficit of £2.4 billion for 1983, £3.8 billion for 1984 and £2 billion for the first half of 1985. This had been covered by North Sea oil, which contributed £6.8 billion in 1983, £7.1 billion for 1984 and £4.2 billion for the first half of 1985.
Report.
The unanimous view of the committee, as expressed in its Report (published on 15 October 1985), was that unless there was a change in attitude towards manufacturing industry Britain faced a political, economic and social crisis. The Report warned that Britain needed to expand its declining manufacturing base to combat the fall in revenue from North Sea oil. If there were no change in economic policy a growing balance of payments deficit would lead to harsh deflationary measures along with lower tax revenues, meaning less spent on public services and defence. The Report also predicted higher unemployment, a stagnating economy, rising inflation and an irreplaceable loss of GDP. The Report added:
The committee takes the view that, together, these prospects constitute a grave threat to the standard of living of the British people. Failure to recognize these dangers now could have a devastating effect on the future economic and political stability of the nation. The situation in which we find ourselves is not self-correcting: things will not come right of their own accord. Urgent action is required, not only by government but by everyone.
The Report quoted an article in the "Lloyds Bank Economic Bulletin" of September 1984 that predicted Britain's current account would change from a £1 billion surplus for that year to a deficit of £13.6 billion in 1990. The Report claimed that services were not a substitute for manufacturing "because many services are dependent on manufacturing and only 20 per cent of services are tradeable overseas". They also warned that there was no reason to expect an "automatic" revival of manufacturing to compensate for the decline of the oil surplus because lost export markets would be difficult to recover. Manufacturing would take years to recover: "New industries and new products usually grow out of long-established activities and require a long time-scale for development".
Response.
The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Leon Brittan, took what "The Times" called the "unprecedented step" of pre-empting the publication of the Report by releasing a statement: "This report needs to be set in perspective if we are not to get a totally biased and misleading view of the performance and prospects of our economy". The Shadow Chancellor, Roy Hattersley, responded by saying the "select committee's view of what will happen to this country if we do not act before the oil runs out confirms exactly what we have been saying in speech after speech for years".
In his Mansion House speech for 1985 the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson, dismissed the Report: "The Government...wholly rejects the mixture of special pleading dressed up as analysis and assertion masquerading as evidence which leads the Committee to its doom-laden conclusion". In his evidence to the Committee Lawson claimed: "There is no adamantine law that says we have to produce as much in the way of manufactures as we consume...If it does turn out that we are relatively more efficient in world terms at providing services than at producing goods, then our national interest lies in a surplus on services and a deficit on goods".
The Report was debated in the House of Lords on 3 December 1985. On 21 October 1987 Lord Beaverbrook claimed that the Report had "largely been discredited by events". This led to a further debate on the Report in November 1987, where Lord Aldington contested Beaverbrook's statement.
The Report ran through five editions and has been used as a teaching aid in universities.

Lake Cut Bank

Lake Cut Bank was a glacial lake formed during the late Pleistocene along the Missouri and Sun Rivers. After the Laurentide Ice Sheet retreated, water melting off the glacier accumulated between the Rocky Mountinas and the ice sheet. The lake drained along the front of the ice sheet, eastward towards the Judith River and the Missouri River.
The front of the Keewatin ice sheet completely blocked the valley of Cut Bank Creek so that for the ice dam was bordered by the water of an extensive lake, which has been designated glacial Lake Cut Bank. It is defined by the granitic pebbles and boulders on top of the hills southeast of Cut Bank and are present at several places in the basin farther north and west all below . The pebbles were deposited from icebergs floating on the lake. The lake bottom is identified by the laminated silts over the flatter parts of the basin. The silts are up to as seen in some of the coulees. Additionally, stratified sand and gravel are visible in the basin. There is no defined shoreline. The lake has been mapped below contour, with shore like slopes between . The Carlow Flat shows evidence of being submerged part of the time. About southwest of Cut Bank the same granite pebbles are found at . This is taken as the maximum and first lake level. The lake drained southward along the ice front. Later the water fell to and flowed through the sag occupied by ponds.
The inner gorge of Cut Bank Creek formed after the glacial lake drained. The lake received runoff from the adjacent land area and from the north front of the Two Medicine Glacier for over (Squaw Buttes, southwest of Cut Bank, westward to the mountains). Cut Bank Glacier and the South Fork of the Milk River drained into Lake Cut Bank.
Water from the St. Mary Glacier and from both the mountain glaciers and the Keewatin ice sheet, north of the international boundary drained into the South Fork of the Milk River and then into glacial Lake Cut Bank. The glacial river channel is not abandoned. It runs form the Milk River northeast of Landslide Butte to the head of Rocky Coulee.
By assuming that each layer of the laminated clay deposited in this lake is a varve, representing one season's deposition, the longevity of the lake could be counted.

Open Labour

Open Labour is an activist group operating within the Labour Party. Open Labour operates as a forum for Labour Party members to discuss ideas, tactics and campaigning in the soft left political tradition, which the organisation hopes to recast as the "open left". Within the party, Open Labour is generally positioned to the right of internal left-wing groups like Momentum and to the left of New Labour groups such as Progress. 
The organisation has been described as an "umbrella group of the Left".
History.
Open Labour was founded in 2015 following the 2015 Labour Party leadership election with the aim of giving voice to the soft left tradition within the Labour Party, which many felt had been largely absent from the debate. 
The soft left tradition within Labour goes back to the 1980s. While many Labour MPs, including the recent Labour leader Ed Miliband, had at times been characterised as coming from the soft left politically, there had not been an internal group advocating for this strand of politics since Compass unaffiliated from the party in 2011 in order to open up its membership to political parties.
Since 2015 Open Labour has produced and published a number of essays across a range of topics on its website, and has held several meetings and conferences to establish its strategy and political positions. It has also held a number of political fringe events at Labour Party conferences. Open Labour has offered its backing to candidates in internal party elections and candidate selections for local and general elections. Several Open Labour activists and members were elected to Parliament in the 2017 United Kingdom general election, including Open Labour Treasurer Alex Sobel, Jo Platt, Emma Hardy, Anna McMorrin, Paul Sweeney, Marsha de Cordova, and Lloyd Russell-Moyle. 
Founding committee member Ann Black was a longstanding member of Labour's National Executive Committee, with the group backing her in her failed re-election bid in 2018.
In the 2019 General Election a number of Open Labour supporters and members were elected to parliament, including Nadia Whittome, Olivia Blake, Feryal Clark, James Murray, and Abena Oppong-Asare.
Open Labour made no endorsement during the 2016 Labour leadership elections. During the 2020 Labour leadership elections, Open Labour endorsed Lisa Nandy for Leader and Angela Rayner for Deputy Leader after an extensive ballot of its members.
In the 2020 National Executive Committee elections, its members voted to endorse Ann Black and Jermain Jackman for the CLP section, George Lindars-Hammond for the new disability section and Alice Perry for the local government section, with Black and Perry winning election. In 2021, the organisation said its membership stood at 1,500 and it plans to make a number of endorsements for upcoming local and devolved elections.
Political positions.
Coming politically from the soft left tradition within Labour, Open Labour looks to recast this ideology as the "open left", defining it as "a practical, open-minded and tolerant type of democratic socialism". The group promotes a "democratic, participatory and pluralist culture".
Their beliefs include advocating an economic platform of transforming the UK economy to a higher-investment, environmentally conscious and more democratic model. They are also generally pro-European, and call for Labour to maintain a close relationship with Europe and its sister parties' on the continent, and for solidarity with those campaigning for social justice here and internationally.
Open Labour has roots in the history of organisations like the Tribune Group and the Labour Coordinating Committee, but also through local government and through trade unions.
In an article about the 2017 Labour Party Conference, Isabel Hardman described the group as the Corbynite flag", arguing that it and the wider soft left in Labour had shifted to the left after that year's general election.

Gino Alache

Gino Alache (born March 22, 1973) is a public relations specialist, music journalist, publicist and radio personality. He is best known as a specialist with in-depth knowledge of hard rock and heavy metal music. His interviews have been broadcast in different languages.
Biography.
Gino Alache was born in Lima, Peru. He grew up in La Molina district and attended a Catholic school on Marianist education. In his adolescence, he started to feel a deep admiration for bands such as Manowar, Metallica, Judas Priest, Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Since then, he began to write music articles finding what it would be his passion.
The beginning.
During his first years of adolescence, he listened a lot the American heavy metal radio programming such as KNAC 105.05, Pure Rock and Pirate Radio, he also followed the MTV television program "Headbangers Ball", and then in 1994, the Latin American version of MTV launched, under the name of Headbangers. It was the perfect opportunity for him to send his first articles by mail from Peru. Those articles were always about the Latin American heavy metal and hard rock scene, and, fortunately, they were accepted by the following programs up to 1997. In an interview on January 17, 2006, for the Portuguese webpage SounD(/)ZonE, he said: “I think that all started when I was in elementary school, a classmate brought a long duration of Iron Maiden – The Number Of The Beast, it was 1982, since then, I become passionate about all this.”
Career.
By January 2002, using the Internet, he began the creation of a website and later an online radio station called Rockum. His first steps in the web were as editor-in-chief and writer about Anglophone hard rock and heavy metal. By 2002, he began to write about records that just launched in Europe and United States, and then the ones from Latin America and Asia.
In 2004, Rockum made its debut with its first interviews with international artists, with two programs such as "World Premiere" and "Breaking The Rock" by streaming.
By 2006, he started to do live international coverage, beginning a new period, he travelled to countries such as Argentina and Chile to broadcast the events of the Latin American scene.
In summer 2008, he began to work in public relations, specialized in training. He was a press agent for the most important international shows in Peru. He worked with artists such as Aerosmith, Metallica, Stryper, Cerati, Skid Row, The Cranberries, José Luis Perales, Rotting Christ and Yellowcard.
In February 2010, Terra Networks hired him as an editor-in-chief of a new blog called Zona de Metal.
In March 2010, the "Phantom Magazine" invited him to be a staff writer, with a monthly column called "Sólido como el Metal"
In April 2010, he did his first international journalistic interview for the most important newspaper of Peru, "El Comercio".
In May 2012, he got a postgraduate degree in public relations and corporate communication from San Martin de Porres University.
In June 2012 by the Radio Clasicas Actuales.com, he released his first radio program, apart from Rockum, called Rockum Classics with just 1970s rock music.
By September 2013, as a general producer and creative director, he was in charge of the intellectual creativity and production of the first heavy metal song of the famous Peruvian singer of Creole and Afro Peruvian music Eva Ayllón with the band of hard rock Temptation Xplodes, the song was called "Desaparecer".
In the same year, the Archbishop of Lima hired him as a producer and press director to create the first massive March for Life by producing and directing three testimonial video clips and a song with a video clip where the Peruvian artist Sandra Muente sang "Vengo a cuidar de ti" ("I come to take care of you").
In September 2014, he released his new video clip with the band Kikasban called Seis (This music comes from the soul), and he tried to mix the different fusions that our cultures, ethnics, and traditions have.
Support to Peruvian rock.
In April 2010, in a new press interview made by the Peruvian newspaper "El Chino", he declared: "The rock in Peru is not only (his commercial stars) Pedro Suárez Vertiz and Libido, be heavy is a matter of survival, we ask the Peruvian State for support to the real rock scene in Peru". The "Chino" newspaper qualified his work as a "quixotic" example that a man does not need to be used to "hang on to boom" to have success.
Personal life.
On September 20, 2014, he married the constitutional lawyer Patricia Ballenas.
Present.
Nowadays, he lives with his wife and continues editing and broadcasting Rockum. Gino produces new artists, and he is a business consultant in matters of press and corporate reputation. He is writing an autobiographical book about his experiences in the world of rock, which will launch by the middle of 2020.
In May 2019, Alache had his first Tv appearance in Canada. Global Television Network in Canada invited him to their "The Morning Show" aired via Global News CKWS-TV in Kingston. In that Canadian breakfast television show, Gino Alache was considered a celebrated music journalist and publicly named a New Kingstonian by the MuchMusic’s and MuchMoreMusic’s longest running on-air Canadian television personality Bill Welychka.

Stefano Bonsignori (cartographer)

Stefano Bonsignori or Buonsignori (died 21 September 1589, in Florence) was an Italian Olivetan monk and cartographer to Francesco I, Grand Duke of Tuscany. He was born in Florence and is most notable for his eponymous Bonsignori Map of Florence.
Biography.
Little is known about Bonsignori's life before he came to be in the service of the Medicis. He was born in Florence and became part of the Olivetan monastic order before being invited in 1575 to become Francesco's cartographer.
According to a letter sent to the superior of his congregations, the Grand Duke intended to entrust him with the completion of the cycle of maps for the Guardaroba (cloakroom) in the Palazzo Vecchio, which remained unfinished after the dismissal of Ignazio Danti. Of the 53 cartographic panels painted on the doors of the cloakroom, 23 are by Bonsignori, with the most recent one being from 1589.
His famous axonometric map of Florence was created under the patronage of Francesco between 1576 and 1584 and etched by Bonaventura Billocardi. The prominence of the Arno River and the detailed depiction of a variety of often quite minor water-related structures is telling of the way in which water management had been an important aspect of the policies of Francesco's father, Cosimo I, whose achievements had transformed the city's landscape.
In 1588 his role as Grand Ducal cartographer was confirmed by Francesco's successor, Ferdinando I.
Stefano Bonsignori died in 1589 and was buried in the church of Santi Michele e Gaetano, but his tomb disappeared during the seventeenth-century reconstruction of the building.

Leprosy in Malta

The history of leprosy in Malta began in the Middle Ages, but the disease became particularly prevalent in the Maltese archipelago during the 19th century.
Before the 16th century.
There is no clear information about the length of time leprosy has been present in Malta, but the origin of the Maltese word is clearly Semitic and suggests a link to Maltese history prior to the arrival of the Normans.
It has been proposed that the Hospitalier religious settlement, which was held by the Franciscans near Mdina, had a leprosarium, but there is a lack of historic evidence to support this.
The first clear testimony about leprosy in Malta is that of Garita Xejbais, a Gozitan, known as "erga corpore morbo lepre" (effects of leprosy on the body) when he gave his testament in support of the church in 1492. This example equally shows that the sick person maintained their legal rights, contrary to what happened in some European countries during the Middle Ages.
Under the Knights of Malta.
When the knights of the Order of St John of Jerusalem arrived in Malta in 1530, they brought their laws with them to the archipelago. Notably, it was stipulated that a knight who had contracted leprosy could be treated for the disease but could not keep his habit. Quarantine rules were decreed, and when the unwell were welcomed to the "Sacra Infermeria", they were cared for in separate cells.
The first case reported during the Hospitalier period is that of a Dominican friar, who died in 1630 at his monastery in Ir-Rabat.
The interest shown by Maltese leaders in the illness grew over the course of the 17th century, as the contagiousness of the disease became better understood. For each suspected case, a precise diagnosis had to be confirmed by multiple specialists.
Census records show that prevalence of the disease remained rather weak as, during the 1687 census, only one 30-year-old woman living in Ħal Qormi is registered as suffering from leprosy, but it is likely that not all cases had been registered, and five other cases were identified during the same period. A few other cases were reported, like that of a religious woman at the monastery of Saint Catherine in Valletta who died in 1770, or that of the son of a Turkish dignitary who came to seek treatment on his journey to Marseille.
The 19th century.
At the beginning of the 19th century, cases of leprosy remained sporadic. Between 1839 and 1858, only seven cases of leprosy were noted— four men and three women. Despite these cases, however, the British health authorities in Malta responded negatively to an enquiry from the Royal College of Medicine about the presence of leprosy on the archipelago, recognising nevertheless that cases might be present but unidentified.
However, prevalence of the condition continued to grow during the second half of the 19th century, perhaps due to increased contact with North Africa but also with British India.
A special committee was created in 1883 which noted 30 known cases of the disease. There were 69 cases in 1890, with prevalence estimated at 42 per 100,000. Eight cases were noted in Gozo of which four were in In-Nadur. Only 11 advanced cases of the disease were admitted to the "Ospizio" for the poor in Il-Furjana. The majority of these cases came from rural areas, such as Ħal Qormi and Il-Mosta. A single case came from Valletta.
The 20th century.
In 1892, the construction of a specialist building for leprosy patients linked to the new hospital in Ħal Luqa was agreed, replacing the "Ospizio" in Il-Furjana. This building was named after Saint Bartholomew. Initially, the hospital only accepted male patients; female patients were only welcomed from 1912 onwards. The maximum number of patients was reached in 1917 with the presence of 114 patients, of which 71 were men and 43 were women, suggesting a prevalence in the archipelago of 49 per 100,000. The presence of the disease declined thereafter.
The isolation conditions were probably very difficult, as the unwell were treated more like prisoners than patients. Several incidents have been noted, in particular in 1900 when there were two attacks on guards and several escapees. A police presence was maintained on the site until 1903. Gradually, the rules regarding isolation were relaxed and the number of incidents diminished. The prevalence of the disease remained constant, with a rate calculated at 47.2 per 100,000 in 1916.
A new specialist service for Gozo patients (Sacré-Cœur hospital) opened at Fort Chambray in Gozo in 1937. However, due to the small number of patients, the service closed in 1956 and Gozo patients were sent to Saint Bartholomew hospital in Malta.
The arrival of effective antibiotics and the death of the oldest patients meant that the number of patients at the hospital diminished until its closure in December 1974. The 22 remaining patients were assigned to quarters in the "Hal Ferha Estate" (a development created in the abandoned fort of Ħal Għargħur) with the provision of a plot of land to cultivate and the care of a nurse and a doctor. There were no more than five of them in 1994.
The 21st century.
The last patient at the "Hal Ferha Estate" was transferred to a geriatric hospital in 2001. The centre was closed in 2004.
Leprosy has since been considered eradicated in Malta.

Lorin Andrews

Lorin Andrews (April 1, 1819 – September 26, 1861) was an educator and school reformer in Ohio. He co-founded the Ohio Teachers Association in 1848 and he was the president of Kenyon College from 1853-1861. He left the position to serve in the American Civil War, and died of typhus contracted in camp.
Early life.
Andrews was born on April 1, 1819 to Alanson and Sally Needham Andrews in Ashland, Ohio, then called Uniontown. As a child, he worked on his father's farm and attended common schools. He married Sarah Gates on October 30, 1843, and the couple had three children, Clara Elizabeth (d. 1928) who married W. L. Rawson, Frank L. (d. 1913) who married May Munson, and Louis (died young).
Career.
Andrews attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio from 1838 to 1840 but had to leave school before graduation because he was unable to pay tuition. Future president Rutherford B. Hayes was a member of that class. During college, he joined the Episcopal church. He then began teaching at Ashland Academy and became principle of the school by 1844. He received an honorary MA degree from Kenyon in 1846 and became interested in politics and law. He passed the bar in 1847 but did not leave the field of education. Also in 1847 he co-founded the Ohio Teachers Association. In 1848 he became teacher and superintendent of the Massillon-Union schools.
He was an advocate for school reforms including: free grade schools in towns and villages, a state education commissioner, common school libraries, township boards of education, state funding of child education, a monthly journal of education, legislative support of institutes, improved buildings, increased wages, and increased public support for education. In 1848, together with Mortimer Dormer Leggett, Andrews became editor of The Free School Clarion. He was a noted advocate of the 1853 School Law which made many of these reforms including the election of a state school commissioner. In 1853 he ran for the office of state commissioner of schools, but was defeated.
In the early 1850s Andrews was an agent for the Ohio Teachers' Association and he served as the body's president in 1854 and 1855. In late 1853 he was elected president of Kenyon College, which had been going through financial difficulties since the 1840s. He began his duties in 1854, which included holding the title of Professor of Mental and Moral Philosophy, Political Economy, etc. Also in 1854 he received an honorary LLD from Princeton College. Andrews tenure at Kenyon was very successful and he was offered the presidency of Iowa State, which had formed in 1858, but he turned it down.
Civil War and death.
At the start of the American Civil War in April 1861, Andrews resigned from Kenyon to raise a company of volunteers. He was known as the first Ohioan to volunteer to fight for the Union in the Civil War, and was suggested for Governor of Ohio that summer. He was given the rank of colonel and put into command of the 4th Ohio Infantry. During the summer, he was encamped in West Virginia and led his regiment in the Battle of Rich Mountain, part of the Western Virginia Campaign. Later in the summer he became sick with typhus. He returned to Gambier and died on September 26, 1861. He was buried on the campus of Kenyon College.
Legacy.
A Civil War camp, Camp Andrews in Knox County, Ohio near Mount Vernon was named for Andrews. In 1866, a large shaft was erected over his grave at Kenyon College. A junior high school in Massillon, Ohio was named for him in 1923.

Remmia gens

The gens Remmia, occasionally written Remia, was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Only a few members of this gens are mentioned in history, of whom the most illustrious was the grammarian Quintus Remmius Palaemon, but many others are known from inscriptions.
Origin.
The Remmii claimed descent from Remus, the twin brother of Romulus, the legendary founder and first King of Rome. Although the traditions relating to them date back to at least the fourth century BC, Romulus and Remus are not generally regarded as historical figures, and in the Greek authors "Remus" is generally called "Romus", for which the apparent diminutive "Romulus" might be regarded as a doublet. However, the nomen "Remmius" could still be derived from "Remus", perhaps a cognomen of uncertain derivation. Chase classifies it among the gentilicia that either originated at Rome, or cannot be shown to have come from anywhere else. Schulze, on the other hand, regards it as an Etruscan name, "rem-ne", perhaps sharing a root with place names such as "Remona" and "Remoria".
Praenomina.
The Remmii largely confined themselves to the most common praenomina, particularly "Marcus", "Lucius", "Gaius", "Publius", and "Quintus". One of the women of this gens bore the feminine praenomen "Prima". Other women of the Remmii bore individualizing surnames derived from old praenomina, identical in form but placed at the end of the name, like cognomina, including "Maxima", "Octavia", "Salvia", and "Secunda", as well as "Tertullina", a diminutive of "Tertia".
Branches and cognomina.
The only distinct family of the Remmii under the Republic bore the surname "Rufus", originally given to someone with red hair. Most of the other surnames of the Remmii seem to have been personal cognomina, many of them belonging to freedmen, and indicating their original names. Of those that represent traditional Roman surnames, "Faustus", fortunate, was an old praenomen that came to be widely used as a cognomen in the late Republic and imperial times. "Felix" means "happy", "Festus" "joyous" or "festive", "Fidelis" "faithful", "Fortis" "strong", "Fructa" "fruitful", "Fructuosa" "very fruitful", "Jucundus" "pleasant", "Scaeva" "left-handed" or "unlucky", and "Severus" "stern" or "severe". Three of the Remmii were named after months, and bore "Januarius", "Aprilis", and "December" as surnames.

Charles Paul Jean Baptiste de Bourgevin Vialart de Saint-Morys

Charles Paul Jean Baptiste de Bourgevin Vialart de Moligny, comte de Saint-Morys (11 July 1743, Paris - 15 August 1795, île de Houat) was a French art collector.
Life.
He was the son of Charles Paul Jean Baptiste de Bourgevin Vialart de Moligny (5 March 1713, Paris - June 1794, Paris), who was himself the son of Charles Antoine Jacques Bourgevin (1680-1764) and Catherine Thérèse Boucher. His mother was Charles Paul Jean Baptiste's wife, Marie Élisabeth Jean Baptiste Guyard de Saint-Clair (1721-1765), daughter of Jean Guyard de Saint-Clair and Marguerite Élisabeth Vialart. The Bourgevin family was linked to the Boucher, Grimaudet and Guiller families. 
He was a member of the 1st (Grey) Company of the King's Musketeers from 1761 to 1769. He married Éléonore Élisabeth de Beauterne de Jauville on 29 July 1769, sole heiress to her uncle Étienne-Paul Boucher (1699-1778). Étienne-Paul was the son of the cloth merchant Louis-Paul Boucher and brother of Charles-Gabriel Boucher de l'Étang (commissioner for the 1st Company of the King's Musketeers) and Catherine Thérèse Boucher. His new wife's fortune allowed him to buy the office of counsellor in the Grand'chambre of the Parlement de Paris. He lived at 8 rue Vivienne in Paris an in 1780 bought an estate at Hondainville, where he began a manor house on the site of the old château to house his collection of drawings, paintings and natural history specimens. The building later became a prison before half the estate was bought by colonel Guillaume-Michel Barbier-Dufay (1769-1834), who demolished the house. The other half remained his wife's property. 
He was an amateur draughtsman and engraver and in 1784 he also began potato farming in what is now the Canton of Mouy. He chose to leave France in 1790 at the start of the French Revolution and so his goods, lands and collections were seized, including all his drawings, which were integrated into the Louvre between 1796 and 1797. He and his wife divorced on 3 December 1794. He was made intendant general of the royal army, but died on the Quiberon Expedition. His son Charles Étienne de Bourgevin Vialart de Saint-Morys was killed in a duel with colonel Barbier-Dufay on 21 July 1817.

He is most notable for his collection of drawings, which he began in 1769 and expanded using his wife's fortune and his inheritance from his uncle in 1778. Antoine Joseph Dezallier d'Argenville's collection of 3350 drawings were sold off on 18-28 January 1779 in 555 lots, of which 84 lots (around 424 drawings) were bought by Saint-Morys. 
He also bought drawings at the sale of the marquis de Gouvernet's collection of 1013 drawings in 1775. At the Mariette sale (15 November 1775-30 January 1776) he bought 400 sheets. He was advised by Jacques Lenglier, who had qualified as an art dealer and painting dealer in 1786. Lenglier bought a third of the drawings at the Prince of Conti sale on 8 April 1777 on behalf of Saint-Morys. By the time he left France he had 12,644 drawings in his collection.

Tullyveela

Tullyveela () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw. The local pronunciation is Tullyveela.
Geography.
Tullyveela is bounded on the west by Derrynananta Lower, Derrynananta Upper, Gowlan and Lannanerriagh townlands and on the east by Corrachomera, Greaghnadoony, Greaghnaloughry and Tullynaconspod townlands. Its chief geographical features are Derrynananta Lough, mountain streams, a waterfall, forestry plantations, a quarry, gravel pits, dug wells and spring wells. Tullyveela is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 505 statute acres.
History.
In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land.
The 1930s Dúchas Folklore collection states- "A battle was fought in Crocán na gCamps, Derryconnessy, Corlough. Co. Cavan. It is supposed to have been fought between the Gael and Danes. When the cavalry were coming to Crocán na gCamps they had a row and fought a battle. The fought in Tullyvella and Conspud. It is not known which side won the battle, but they are still supposed to fight, at certain times of the year at night, and it is thought to be a bad sign of disturbance when dead people come back to fight. About 100-200 years ago battles were fought in the Townlands of Tullyvella and Conspud between the dead people who fought at the battle of Crocán na gCamps. In the morning after these battles were fought, the heather would be red with blood. One night there was a fight in Conspud and a man heard a voice calling him by his Christian name, that a neighbour's house was on fire. He looked out and saw the neighbour's house on fire, but he did not go to it. Next day the house was not burned, but was as if nothing happened." 
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Tullyvelagh" and the owner as "John Finlay".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list twenty-one tithepayers in the townland.
The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- "The soil is light and produces bad crops of oats, potatoes etc. It pays no county cess nor tithe, being considered a track of mountain...It is bounded on the north-east &amp; south-west sides by two large streams which rise in the mountain and run south-east".
The Tullyveela Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 110, being 54 males and 56 females. There were twenty houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 93, being 43 males and 50 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were sixteen houses in the townland, all inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists forty-five landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 102, being 48 males and 54 females. There were eighteen houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.
In 1871 the population of the townland was 109, being 58 males and 51 females. There were twenty houses in the townland, one of which was uninhabited.(page 296 of census)
In 1881 the population of the townland was 97, being 46 males and 51 females. There were seventeen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In 1891 the population of the townland was 97, being 44 males and 53 females. There were nineteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are twenty-one families listed in the townland.
In the 1911 census of Ireland, there are twenty-one families listed in the townland.

Günter von Drenkmann

Günter von Drenkmann (9 November 1910 - 10 November 1974) was a German lawyer. In 1967 he was appointed president of the Berlin district court ("Kammergericht"). The post was one that had held between 1890 and 1904. He was killed by "2 June Movement" terrorists during a kidnapping attempt.
Life.
Provenance and connections.
George Richard Ernst Günter von Drenkmann was born in Berlin. He came from a well-connected family. The "Drenckmanns" had become "von Drenckmanns" when his grandfather was ennobled in 1901. His father, Edwin von Drenkmann (1864-1944) had been a senior Prussian financial official ("Geheime Oberfinanzrat"). His mother, born Helen Drory (1874-1968), was the granddaughter of Leonard Drory (1800-1866), an entrepreneur from Colchester, England, and his wife.
One of Günter von Drenkmann's sons, Peter von Drenkmann, later also served as president of the Berlin district court ("Kammergericht"), between 1999 and 2005.
Early years.
Günter von Drenkmann studied Jurisprudence at Tübingen, Munich and Berlin. His education was predicated on the expectation that he should follow the family tradition and become a judge. However, at the start of 1933 the Nazis took power and lost no time in transforming Germany into a one-party dictatorship. Von Drenckmann repeatedly refused to join any Nazi-connected organisation, so was unable to become a judge. Instead he worked on legal matters in industry and for the chamber of commerce.
In the later 1930s, together with his friend Francis Wolff he was a member of "Hot Club Berlin". This was a circle of friends who got together in private to listen to banned jazz music. They also established contact with one or two jazz musicians such as Herb Flemming. In 1939 Wolff, who was Jewish, emigrated to New York to escape Nazi oppression. There he built a career as a successful record company executive. Von Drenkmann stayed in Germany.
In April 1939 he married Lilo Morgenroth.
Middle years.
May 1945 marked the end of the war and the end of the Nazi regime. Drenkmann was among relatively few lawyers who had stayed independent of the Nazi Party. By temperament he was a liberal Social Democrat, and in 1945 (if not earlier) he became a member of the Social Democratic Party ("Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands" / SPD).
His career as a judge began in 1947 with appointment as a judge for civil matters at the Berlin district court ("Kammergericht"). True to his family tradition, a succession of promotions quickly followed. In 1967 he was selected as president of the Berlin district court ("Kammergericht").
Death.
Von Drenkmann celebrated his sixty-fourth birthday on 9 November 1974. He planned to retire a year later. On Sunday 10 November 1974 he was at home with his wife. An unexpected visitor appeared at the door. When the bell rang he went to open the door, placing it "on the chain" because something felt not right. Several assailants forced their way into the apartment. There was a struggle and a gun was used. Someone fired a .38 calibre "dumdum" bullet and it hit Drenkmann. Neighbours saw the attackers escape in two cars. Günter von Drenkmann died on the way to hospital.
The "2 June Movement" claimed credit for the "action" against someone whom it said was one of those "responsible ... for the murder of a comrade".
The previous day, Holger Meins, a student member of the RAF terrorist group, had died at , where he had been held. Meins was known as a large man but weighed just 39 kg at the time of his death. It was reported and widely accepted that he had died of starvation as a result of a hunger strike that he and other RAF prisoners had undertaken in an effort to pressure authorities to improve prison conditions.
The attack on von Drenkmann was found to have been part of a planned that went wrong. Some of the terrorists believed they had a "need to escalate their profile".
In 1986 six members of the "2 June Movement" were prosecuted in what was known as the Lorenz-Drenkmann trial, which covered both the 1974 killing of Günter von Drenkmann and the 1975 kidnapping of Peter Lorenz. The court was unable to attribute the killing of von Drenkmann to any of the six individuals on trial. It remains unclear who killed von Drenkmann. All six defendants were convicted of the kidnapping of Peter Lorenz and membership in a criminal association. They were sentenced to substantial jail terms, of up to fifteen years apiece.
The murder of von Drenkmann is frequently cited as the first of a series of widely publicised terrorist actions in West Germany.
A state funeral for von Drenkmann was held in front of Berlin's Schöneberg City-hall. More than 20,000 members of the public attended. West German President Walter Scheel gave a brief address, calling for all democrats to join the war against terror.
Commemoration.
A bronze memorial tablet to von Drenkmann was placed on the former courthouse building in Berlin-Charlottenburg. When the court relocated to Berlin-Schöneberg another memorial tablet was placed near the entrance. However, plans announced in 2004 to rename the street in which the new building is located from Elßholzstraße to Drenkmannstraße have not been implemented. "The checking processes continue" was the explanation from Andrea Boehnke, speaking on behalf of the Justice Ministry, when asked about it in 2014.

Speak No Evil (novel)

Speak No Evil is an American mystery novel by Mignon G. Eberhart. It was published by Random House in 1941, and was issued in the UK by Collins Crime Club. It was reissued in hardcover by Amereon House in 1995.
Background.
This was the first of two novels by Eberhart to be set in Jamaica, the other being "Enemy in the House". This work was completed in late 1939, shortly before the author and her husband traveled to Jamaica in November of that year; this trip was used for research, so that Eberhart could appropriately capture the location's atmosphere.
Plot Summary.
When wealthy Richard Dakin is murdered while on vacation in Jamaica. Suspicion immediately falls upon Elizabeth, his new and much younger bride. To complicated matters, Elizabeth used to be romantically involved with Richard's nephew, Dyke Sanders, and appears to still carry a torch for him. Richard's ex-wife, Charmain, and his assistant, Ruth Reddington, soon get mixed up in the case as well.
Reception.
Kirkus Review called "Speak No Evil" a "velvet smooth concoction that doesn't deviate far from previous successful patterns." The "New York Times", praised "Speak No Evil" as "a well-told and interesting mystery story, with a situation of excellent intricacy and with real subtlety of character drawings. Hearty applause!" The Times closed its review by calling the novel "one of the best of the author's tales."
In a twenty-first century queer reading of the text, Rick Cypert points to the character of Dyke Sanders (the female protagonist's effete former boyfriend) as a typical example of Eberhart's use of queer-coded characters.

Karthik Ramanna is Professor of Business &amp; Public Policy and Director of the Master of Public Policy Program at the University of Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government.
Ramanna's scholarship has explored regulation and decision-making at the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the International Accounting Standards Board. He has also written about the costs and benefits of fair value accounting. His 2015 book "Political Standards" posits that accounting rule-making is an exemplar of a "thin political market," a regulatory setting of economic consequence in which the general public is largely disinterested and where corporate special interests possess relevant tacit knowledge. This situation can result in regulatory capture.
Ramanna is a proponent of reforming business ethics education, arguing that corporate managers have unique capabilities and duties to steward the basic institutions of capitalism. Prior to Oxford, Ramanna taught leadership, ethics, and financial reporting at Harvard Business School, where he won the International Case Centre's Outstanding Case-Writer prize, dubbed by the Financial Times as “the business school Oscars.”

Neuroplastic surgery

Neuroplastic or neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery is the surgical specialty involved in reconstruction or restoration of patients who undergo surgery of the central or peripheral nervous system. The field includes a wide variety of surgical procedures that seek to restore or replace a patient’s skull, face, scalp, dura (the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord), the spine and/or its overlying tissues.
History of the field.
Neuroplastic surgery has adapted reconstructive principles from the fields of craniofacial surgery, and plastic and reconstructive surgery and refined them in order to prevent and/or address challenging deformities which result from Neurosurgical Procedures. The evolution of this new specialty and first center for Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery was started at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland by a formal collaboration between the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery and Department of Neurosurgery, under the vision of Dr. Chad Gordon. &lt;/ref&gt; Gordon CR, et al. Neuroplastic Surgery. J Craniofac Surg. 2018; Jan;29(1):4-5. PMID: 29077688 &lt;/ref&gt; Upon arrival to Johns Hopkins Hospital, Dr. Chad Gordon formed a multi-disciplinary team of physicians, scientists and engineers. &lt;https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/profiles/results/directory/profile/9251953/chad-gordon&gt; The team’s unified goal was to develop techniques and devices to treat adult neurosurgical patients. These advances led to several "first-in-human" publications and skull implant/craniofacial computer-assisted technology patents, and allowed for the establishment of the first formal fellowship training program in Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery. J Craniofac Surg. 2018 Jan;29(1):4-5. doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000004063. .&lt;/ref&gt; Gordon CR. Understanding Cranioplasty. J Craniofac Surg. 2016 Jan;27(1):5.doi: 10.1097/SCS.0000000000002312. .&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018, Dr. Gordon was appointed the Director of Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Johns Hopkins. In 2018, the "Society of Neuroplastic Surgery" was officially formed with the mission to "advance the art, science, and technology related to Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery", and at that time, Dr. Gordon was elected to be the society's first President. &lt;www.SNPS2018.org&gt;
The first peer reviewed journal to recognize neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery as its own field was the "Journal of Craniofacial Surgery" which dedicated its January 2018 issue to introducing the new field of neuroplastic surgery to its readership. In that issue, the editor-in-chief, Mutaz Habal, published an editorial on neuroplastic surgery where he stated: "Based on the desire to present the fact that neuroplastic surgery is there, we have a dedicated this issue of the "Journal of Craniofacial Surgery". This presentation mostly involves surgical procedures that will be termed ‘‘neuroplastic’’ in the years to come."
Training.
Training in neuroplastic surgery requires completion of a neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery fellowship which lasts 1–2 years. Such fellowships are available to individuals who have completed a residency in Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, ENT Surgery, Neurosurgery or Oral and Maxillofacial surgery. As of today, the only formal fellowship training program in neuroplastic and reconstructive surgery is located at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins Hospital. The fellowship is co-sponsored by both Departments of Plastic Surgery and Neurosurgery. For each of the clinical fellows in the program, there is an expected volume of participating in over 110 neuro-cranial reconstructions per year with Dr. Gordon and his neurosurgery colleagues, as well as a large spectrum of complex scalp reconstruction and craniofacial cases. The first surgeon formally trained in "Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery" was Dr. Gabriel Santiago [2016-18], who completed ENT surgery residency in the US Navy prior to starting the fellowship. The first Neuroplastic Surgery Research Fellow was Dr. Amir Wolff [2017-18], an attending oral-maxillofacial surgeon from Rambam Medical Center in Haifa, Israel.
Annual Neuroplastic Surgery Symposium.
The first Annual Neuroplastic and Reconstructive Surgery Symposium was held at Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital in September 2015, co-chaired by Dr. Chad Gordon (Johns Hopkins) and Dr. Michael Yaremchuk (Harvard). Its overarching mission was to increase collaboration, awareness and synergy amongst numerous disciplines including craniofacial plastic surgery, adult-based cranial neurosurgery, biomedical engineering, and neurology for improved patient outcomes. Since then, the symposium has grown significantly and rotates annually between Harvard Medical School/Massachuestts General Hospital (Boston, MA) and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine/Johns Hopkins Hospital (Baltimore, MD). Its main emphasis relates to cranioplasty, implants and implantable neurotechnologies. &lt;https://hopkinscme.cloud-cme.com/default.aspx?P=5&amp;EID=18099&gt;

Phantom Brickworks

Phantom Brickworks is the eighth studio album by English producer Stephen Wilkinson, known by his stage name Bibio. Released on 3 November 2017, it's his sixth album for Warp Records and his first entirely ambient record. The album is a set of improvised compositions consisting of simple piano, synth, and guitar loops surrounded by tape hiss and field recordings. Making the songs based on the concept that "places can be haunted by meaning," Wilkinson mentally went into both real and fantasy places when producing the tracks. The album was well-received by reviewers, who called it Bibio's most accomplished record, and landed at number 11 on "Time Out New York"'s list of the best albums of 2017.
Concept.
The pieces on "Phantom Brickworks" gave Wilkinson "a mental portal into" real and imagined settings. He made the LP based on the concept that "places can be haunted by meaning," reasoning, "human beings are highly sensitive to the atmospheres of places, which can be enhanced or dramatically altered when you learn about the context of their history." The songs are very similar to electronic voice phenomena recordings in their attempt to record sounds of ghostly activity. Most of the song titles are references to parts of the United Kingdom, such as the track named after Capel Celyn, a community in Gwynedd, Wales that was intentionally flooded to create a reservoir in 1965, and "Capel Bethania," a song named after a chapel demolished in 1991.
Production and composition.
While elements of ambient music have been included in all of Bibio's records, "Phantom Brickworks" is his first entirely ambient release. The album is a set of improvised, slow-tempo minimal ambient electronic compositions that were written and recorded in more than ten years using only a microphone and loop pedal. Compared by multiple reviewers to the works of William Basinski, Gas, and the more ambient records of Aphex Twin and Brian Eno, each song involves short piano, synthesizer, and guitar loops being transformed into "ghostly textures," described "Time Out NY". Sam Walker-Smart analyzed the sounds "constantly weave in and out of the mix, drifting by as if in a dream."
"Phantom Brickworks" has a very spacious structure that uses lots of reverberation, delay, and elements of long sustain in the composition: "XLR8R" analyzed it has a "widescreen vibe," where the tracks have "patient, sometimes nearly imperceptible cycles of accretion and subsidence" and, as a result, "feel as much like landscapes as they do music." On each track, hazy filtering, field recordings, and tape hiss are present to either drown out or undermine the importance of the main loop. As "Clash" magazine noted, "the material on "Phantom Brickworks" writes its own rules [of ambient music] as it progresses, with Bibio uncovering fresh techniques simply through the act of performance." Writer Philippa Nicole Barr states that in achieving a haunting vibe, the music's rhythmic structure follows a sort-of offbeat pattern that "conveys that sense of the uncanny – slowing the listener down to a meditative state, so that they can begin to imagine the many phantoms all around them."
Release and promotion.
"Phantom Brickworks III" and "Capel Celyn" were released on 19 September 2017 and 25 October 2017 respectively as preview tracks for "Phantom Brickworks". On 2 November 2017, the "Phantom Brickworks" audio/visual installation was held at The Boiler House in The Old Truman Brewery, London with music from the album serving as the soundtrack. Warp Records summarized it as a "stunning historical venue, exploring themes of landscape, time and place through large-scale projections of films." Warp released "Phantom Brickworks" on 3 November 2017. The music video for "Capel Celyn," released on 30 November 2017, is footage of remains of the song's titular town.
Critical reception.
Several critics called "Phantom Brickworks" Bibio's most accomplished release. Some reviewers praised Bibio for taking on a new style, "No Ripcord" stating that it "solidifies Bibio as an artist of remarkable versatility," while others highlighted its ghostly yet listener-friendly atmosphere. "The Line of Best Fit" claimed, "With Phantom Brickworks Bibio has not only created a record that stands apart from his other Warp albums to date, but has cemented his mastery of the atmospheric; creating an album that can imprint on a listeners’ surroundings like few others." 
"PopMatters" applauded the album for being more "consistent" than previous Bibio albums, which "tend to lose their identity in his experimentations, ending up as a pile of mixed goods." "The Music" opined, "It'd be tempting to write this off as a potboiler in between major projects, but there are subtle undercurrents of emotion that gently reel in the patient listener." Daniel Sylvester of "Exclaim!", however, criticized the tracks for being too long, "only the two-minute "Ivy Charcoal" providing the listener with something wholly digestible." "Time Out New York" ranked it the eleventh best album of 2017, and AllMusic placed it on their list of the year's best electronic albums.
Track listing.
All tracks written, recorded, and produced by Stephen Wilkinson and mastered by Guy Davie at Electric Mastering in London.

Olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily ag member 2

Olfactory receptor family 2 subfamily AG member 2 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the OR2AG2 gene.
Function.
Olfactory receptors interact with odorant molecules in the nose, to initiate a neuronal response that triggers the perception of a smell. The olfactory receptor proteins are members of a large family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) arising from single coding-exon genes. Olfactory receptors share a 7-transmembrane domain structure with many neurotransmitter and hormone receptors and are responsible for the recognition and G protein-mediated transduction of odorant signals. The olfactory receptor gene family is the largest in the genome. The nomenclature assigned to the olfactory receptor genes and proteins for this organism is independent of other organisms.

Carmen Barros

Carmen Aída Barros Alfonso (born 7 January 1925) is a prominent Chilean actress and singer of jazz, popular music, and opera. In addition, she is a professor of acting perception, diction, and vocal projection, and a theater and opera director. She is known for being the first to portray the character Carmela in the Isidora Aguirre play "" in 1960.
Biography.
Carmen Barros is the elder of two siblings. Because of her father's military profession, which caused him to be sent on missions in Germany, as well as to different garrisons in the country, Carmen never stayed more than seven months at one school. She lived between Santiago, other cities of the country, Peru, and Europe, and learned to speak German before Spanish.
However, she attended the French Nuns, a women's college where she was the "wild card" of the course for any artistic competition involving dancing or acting.
When she was 14, her father was assigned as Chilean ambassador to Germany, and that change marked her life. It was 1940, and World War II was in full development. A lot of people Barros' age that she met on this trip she never saw again; they joined Hitler's army to colonize Europe and fell out of contact. As a counterpoint, the cultural opportunities of Berlin influenced her future career: concerts, opera, theater; despite the horror of the war, that never changed. She tried to resume her basic education, in a German school, but could not stand being in a co-educational one, so she chose to retire and take private classes at home. However, she never finished her studies.
At age 19, Barros returned to Chile, but everything had changed. Santiago del Campo offered to let her sing on the radio and gave her the pseudonym "Marianela". She had begun her career as a singer.

As a result, he gains the power to travel through dimensions and create rifts that can act as small barriers. In High School, Derek is an unpopular kid and is best friends with a girl named Ernestine.
A few months after Derek acquires his powers, he is video recording his powers when he meets a being known as Tempus Fuginaut who accuses Derek of causing tears in reality. Derek escapes but he dislocates his shoulder, and he goes to his best friend Ernestine for help. Ernestine takes him to the hospital, where Derek's adoptive mother arrives worrying for him. Suddenly, a mentally unstable woman name Killspeed breaks out and kills several hospital staff members in order to take some money for her cancer. Derek puts his Sideways costume on and they fight, with Sideways defeating her. When the police arrive, Sideways uses his Rift abilities to teleport, but he accidentally severs Killspeed's arm. A few weeks later, Derek teams up with Hot Spot, a former Teen Titan, to take down a man named Replicant who can replicate superpowers. Replicant accidentally kills himself when he creates multiple rifts on top of his body, and Sideways gains popularity.
Sideways is called out by a villain name Showman who gains power the more people are angry. With quick thinking from Erin, she calms the audience, which allows Sideways to teleport Showman to a different location where he defeats him. Derek is overwhelmed with stress and doesn't talk to his adoptive mother, but finds out she was killed by people who were investigating him.
Derek manages to find out the people who killed his mother, and defeat most of them. Derek joins the Young Justice team.
At some point, Derek joins the Seven Soldiers of Victory.
Powers and abilities.
Due to Derek falling through the Dark Multiverse during the " event, he acquired several powers involving reality and spacetime manipulation. Derek has the ability to create rifts (tears in the space-time continuum) which allow him to travel through any place he wants as long as he knows where it is. He can also teleport to other people's locations as long as he knows who they are; he did not know where his best friend was but when he imagined her face, he immediately teleported to her location. He can also use rifts for offensive abilities, like cutting off people or redirecting their attacks back at them. Sideways also has super strength and durability as well. When Derek creates a rift on top of another rift, it can create a miniature Black Hole.
Supporting cast.
Some of Sideways' supporting characters include fellow High School student and avid cosplayer Ernestine "Ernie" Edgars, who makes Derek's costume, his adopted parents David and Helen Flynn. Throughout his life, Derek gains allies including former Teen Titans member Isaiah Crockett / Hotspot. He also joins the Seven Soldiers of Victory.
Critical reception.
The character has been commonly compared to Marvel Comics character Spider-Man, specifically the Ultimate version, evoking both his costume design and personality. The character and comic initially received mixed reviews, with the first issue averaging 7 out of 10 according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup. Over time, the series received generally positive reviews with an average rating of 7.4 out of 10. In a review of the first issue for IGN, Blair Marnell praised Rocafort's art but said the teenage dialogue was "so far off of the mark that it borders on self-parody." Bleeding Cool called the character "charming" but the story "meandering". It went on to say Rocafort's art is fantastic but not the best fit for the comic's tone. The character is part of an effort to increase diversity within the fictional setting and has received attention for being a minority character drawn by a Puerto Rican artist.

Wild Fire (band)

Wild Fire is an American rock band founded in Biloxi, Mississippi, on November 5, 2015. it currently consists of duo Zack Sawyer (vocals and piano) and Tyler Voss (bass). The band emerged from Cathercist founded by former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts. After Cathercist lost some band members they recruited new ones, which changed the band's musical direction. As a result, the band no longer felt comfortable performing under their original name and changed it to Wild Fire. Before this transformation, Cathercist had released two albums titled "The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer" and "As Hope Expires".
Wild Fire released their single, "Villain", on November 5, 2015, which was later included on their debut album released on May 23, 2017, titled "Revolt". With this release, they also announced the end of Cathercist. "Revolt" contains 15 tracks, one of them a cover of Dr. Hook's "The Cover of Rolling Stone", the album's final track.
On March 29, 2018, Wild Fire announced in a Facebook post about an upcoming acoustic record and revealed that Taylor Roberts would be leaving the band. It has been reported that Alidor also left Wild Fire with Roberts, but the band has not confirmed this. On July 26, 2018, Wild Fire announced that Wade Sigue will be replacing Taylor Roberts as lead guitarist. Then on August 2, 2018, Sawyer announced their new musical project is called "At the Lake House"; each song from will be released independently, not collectively as an album.
On January 10, 2019, the band revealed through a Facebook livestream that their new drummer is called Britt Hartley and he will be replacing Cameron Alidor. Soon after this, it was reported that Hartley left the band. With no further comment, Sawyer said “it wasn’t working out.”
History.
Formation and early years.
Wild Fire was founded on November 5, 2015, in Biloxi, Mississippi. It evolved from the band Cathercist, which had been active for five years according to an article in the "Sun Herald". Former Wild Fire guitarist Taylor Roberts founded Cathercist in Gulfport, Mississippi, but the exact date of the band's beginning is unclear. On their official page on ReverbNation the band says Cathercist was founded in 2007, while other sources say the band was officially established in 2010. During an interview, Roberts said the band was founded in 2005–2006. They appeared at the 2008 Taste of Chaos concert where they opened for Avenged Sevenfold, Atreyu, and Bullet For My Valentine. This indicates the band was active prior to 2010 and before Sawyer joined as the lead vocalist. The band adapted their name from the word "catharsis", which they defined as purging or cleansing oneself through music or art.
Cathercist released their debut album titled "The Untimely Death of Zack Sawyer" in 2011. The name represents the change Sawyer went through in the process of making the album. It was recorded in Argo, Alabama, at Echelon Studios, and was produced, mixed and mastered by Joseph McQueen. The band released their second album "As Hope Expires" on May 24, 2013. They began recording it a week after the release of their first album. It consists of eight tracks, four of which appear on "Revolt", Wild Fire's 2017 debut album. The instrumentals were recorded in Miami at Bieler Bros. Studios over the course of a week and the vocals were recorded in Wisconsin. Matt LaPlant produced, mixed and mastered the album. In 2014 Wild Fire was the national winner of the Ernie Ball Battle of the Bands at Welcome to Rockville.
Wild Fire includes members from Cathercist, Zack Sawyer and Taylor Roberts. The other known members of Cathercist were: Aaron Buck (rhythm guitar), Hollis Godsey (bass guitar) and his brother, Chris Godsey (drums), Daniel Ferguson (guitars), Mikhail Cintgran (bass guitar), and Matt Marciana (drums). Tyler Voss and Cameron Alidor replaced them in Wild Fire. Sawyer became a member of Cathercist when he first met Roberts in Mobile, Alabama, in 2009. He was originally a member of a band called 35 Point Week. After they broke up Sawyer auditioned for Cathercist, who had also lost their singer, and was hired the same night.
With a new lineup and the release of the new single, "Villain", in 2015, they announced Cathercist was over and that the band would continue making music under its new name Wild Fire with Zack Sawyer on vocals and piano, Taylor Roberts on guitar, Tyler Voss on bass, and Cameron Alidor on drums. After the announcement, Cathercist's official website was taken down, and their Facebook account was renamed "Wild Fire".
When Sawyer was asked how Wild Fire emerged from Cathercist, he responded saying: Taylor Roberts and myself were working on our record with our band Cathercist for a couple of years and then we lost some members. We were still continuing to work on it, but by the time the record was written, with the new people involved, it was just a different sound. It was something new, something we wanted to push forward with and something we really loved. It's not like we thought our fans didn't like it—we just didn't feel comfortable continuing under the same name. There were a lot of twists and turns to get where we looked up and said 'we need to change the name. It's time'. Taylor Roberts said it was the beginning of a new chapter for them and with four members it felt like a different band with the lineup change.
2017–present: "Revolt" and "At the Lake House" project.
The band released their debut album "Revolt" on May 23, 2017. "Revolt" contains 15 tracks and was produced by Matt LaPlant, who sang backing vocals for some of the songs. The song's official lyric video has had over 426,880 views on YouTube, and been streamed more than 600,000 times on Spotify. In total, all the videos containing the song on YouTube have more than three million views. The single peaked at number 82 on the Media Base Rock Charts in the third quarter of 2017.
In an interview, when Roberts was asked about "Villain", he said the song was about being a villain after he hinted he did not write the song. He cited The Joker as an inspiration, saying "there's always been something so fascinating about [Joker]. He's a villain you fall in love with and every now and again, you can find yourself in those same shoes, so his character becomes very relatable."
The band covered one of Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show's songs titled "Cover of the Rolling Stone", which is included on "Revolt". Sawyer revealed that his cousin, Ray Sawyer, was a member in Dr. Hook &amp; The Medicine Show which disbanded in 1985, not long after Ray Sawyer left the band to pursue a solo career.
Wild Fire has been featured at 1065 Fest 2016, Rocklahoma 2017, Gulfport Music Fest 2017, and Inktober Fest 2017.
The band began touring across the United States after the release of "Revolt". They announced a show on September 5, 2017, in Mobile, Alabama, alongside Sick Puppies. Later, on November 14, 2017, they announced a show opening for Sleeping With Sirens in the House of Blues Parish Room in New Orleans on November 15. They also announced they had signed with Artery Global to fulfill their booking needs. In early 2018, the band announced a free concert at the House of Blues in New Orleans alongside Appetite for Destruction, a Guns N' Roses tribute band. Sawyer revealed plans for a new record in summer 2018.
On March 29, 2018, along with a statement of an upcoming acoustic record the band announced that Taylor Roberts was leaving Wild Fire. During a Facebook live stream, Tyler Voss and Zack Sawyer announced that the band will "no longer be genre specific", they also revealed that they will be trying to release a new song each month. According to former lead guitarist Roberts, the album features songs from their debut album "Revolt" re-recorded acoustically, along with some covers, at Sawyer's house in the last week of February. On April 25, 2018, the band released a single from the new album, which is a cover of Post Malone's "I Fall Apart", to YouTube. on May 2, 2018, Roberts performed his last show with Wild Fire.
On June 27, 2018, drummer Cameron Alidor also announced through a Facebook post that he will be leaving Wild Fire "to focus on other opportunities." It has been reported that Alidor left the band when Roberts did, but Wild Fire postponed the announcement. On July 11, Wild Fire broke the news to their fans on their official Facebook account, stating that "auditions are officially closed for guitar" and they are accepting auditions from drummers.
On July 26, 2018, Sawyer and Voss revealed via a video posted to YouTube and their social media accounts that the guitarist from Memory of a Melody, Wade Sigue, will be replacing Taylor Roberts.
On August 2, 2018, Sawyer reported the band will be releasing a collection of songs titled "At the Lake House", but each of the songs will be released independently. Amongst the songs will be re-recorded tracks from "Revolt" and covers of pop songs. Sawyer reported that even though they announced they will no longer be genre specific, that does not mean they will leave hard rock behind. He said that "At the Lake House" was a project they wanted to do.
All the songs on "At the Lake House" will be acoustic. Roberts left with two songs left to be recorded. The guitar parts for those songs were written by Sawyer and producer Matt LaPlant. It has been reported that the band also stripped off some parts of the finished songs which were written by Roberts.
On November 6, 2018, the band released the second song from "At the Lake House", which was a cover of Marshmallow's "Silence".
On February, 14, 2019, the band published their first song since "Silence" titled "Earned It", with a noticeable stylistic change musically.
Musical style and influences.
Wild Fire labeled the genre of their music as "loud and aggressive hard rock" in 2015–2018. During an interview, former guitarist Taylor Roberts said: "We’re too hard to be hard rock but we’re not hard enough to be metal, so we’re kind of a nice little in-between [...] we hate labeling the genre that we’re in. We play music and we like to have a good time." After Roberts left the band, Sawyer and Voss both announced that they will no longer be genre specific.
After the announcement, some fans were led to believe that Wild Fire will be abandoning hard rock. Sawyer said:We haven’t left the old sound behind exactly. People who love music tend to love all kinds of music. We’re just showing off a different side to our musical interests. The hard rock is not gone. This was just something we had to do. […] It just means we’re going to do whatever we want with little to no regard for what we’ve done in the past. It means that we’re a rock band that can do anything. If I want to write an acoustic song, I will. A pop song, a rap song, a country song. It means this band will fulfill all of our musical endeavors instead of making side projects to fulfill those ideas. We’re still making rock music.
The band is known for using classical instruments like pianos and strings on their songs, especially on the "Revolt" record. The band has seen a stylistic change with their new materials, stripping rock elements from the "At the Lake House" songs.

She has not dealt only with the social area but was also a loud and frequent critic of the government corruption scandals, including corrupted redistribution of euro-funds in agriculture or social and labour policies.
She remarried in June 2016, subsequently being known as Lucia Ďuriš Nicholsonová. She was part of a small delegation from the Slovak parliament to meet the Dalai Lama during his visit to Slovakia in October 2016.
Member of the European Parliament, 2019–present.
In May 2019 Ďuriš Nicholsonová became one of the 14 Members of the European Parliament from Slovakia, as her political party Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) has won 9.60% of votes, resulting in two mandates. In parliament, she is a member of the European Parliament's Committee on Employment and Social Affairs (EMPL) and the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). On 18 July 2019 she was elected as chair of the EMPL Committee.
In 2021, Ďuriš Nicholsonová left the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) to join the Renew Europe group in Parliament. She was subsequently reelected chair of the EMPL committee, winning 38 votes compared to runner-up Margarita de la Pisa Carrión who won 15 votes.
Political positions.
Ďuriš Nicholsonová is well known for the reform she proposed as an opposition politician to improve living conditions of Romani people in Slovakia and prevent their further socio-economic exclusion, consisting of early pre-schooling for children from excluded communities and more effective, specialised and motivational social support and tailored assistance. She has focused on employment and social matters, including rights of persons with disabilities and active ageing, during her European election campaign and praised work–life balance incentives of the European Parliament.

Vasari Sacristy

The Vasari Sacristy (Italian - "Sacrestia del Vasari") or Old Sacristy (Italian - "Sacrestia Vecchia") is a room in Sant'Anna dei Lombardi, Naples, Italy, one of its two sacristies. It was the refectory of the Olivetan monastery of Santa Maria di Monteoliveto until 1688, when it was converted to its current role. The conversion in 1688 revealed 15th century inlays by Fra Giovanni da Verona, also to be seen in the church's Tolosa Chapel. The church was renamed Sant'Anna dei Lombardi in 1805.
An "Adoration of the Shepherds" by a follower of Vasari was moved to its present position above the door in the counter-facade during the 17th century. The two side lunettes contain sculptures of the archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary, attributed to Giovan Battista Cavagna and resting on two marble lavabos leaning against the walls.
The central nave vault is divided into three quadrants, showing personifications of Faith, Religion and Eternity It is accompanied along the walls by 17th century furniture decorated with a cycle of precious wooden inlays by Fra Giovanni da Verona dating to 1506 (the third cycle after those of Santa Maria in Organo in Verona and the Territorial Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore near Asciano) with views of the city and scenes of life in the Olivetan order. Between the inlays are niches with wooden statues showing saints relating to the Olivetans. Behind the altar is a painting of Carlo Borromeo by Girolamo d'Arena, which had hung in the original church of Sant'Anna dei Lombardi (which had also been dedicated to St Carlo Borromeo) but was moved to its present location after that church was destroyed in the 1805 earthquake. Either side are two paintings of Michael the Archangel and the Virgin Mary.
History.
It is named after Giorgio Vasari who in 1545 painted its vault frescoes, whilst it was still a refectory. His fame had reached Naples due to his 1542-44 works in Rome and due to his capacity to complete commissions quickly. His time in Campania from 1544 to 1545 was short but busy and brought Tuscan Mannerism (which had previously only reached as far as Rome) to Naples. He received several commissions from viceroy don Pedro da Toledo, from noblemen and from monasteries, the first of which was to decorate the old refectory of the monastery next to Santa Maria di Monteoliveto.
He almost refused it due to the space's Gothic architecture, which he felt might be too dark to show off his style to best effect. He decided to take it, however, and plastered the vaults, brightening the space and giving him extra space to paint. Some of the figures were painted from Vasari's drawings by Raffaellino del Colle, whilst Stefano Veltroni and others assisted with the purely decorative areas. Whilst painting the frescoes Vasari also produced two triptychs, one for the room's counter-facade and one for its back wall, showing "The Manna from Heaven" and "The Feast in the House of Simon", now in the Museo nazionale di Capodimonte and Museo Diocesano di Napoli.

<doc id="56650665" url="?curid=56650665" title="Air-liquid interface cell culture">
Air-liquid interface cell culture

Air liquid interface cell culture (ALI) is a method of cell culture by which basal stem cells are grown with their basal surfaces in contact with media, and the top of the cellular layer is exposed to the air. The cells are then lifted and media is changed until the development of a mucociliary phenotype of a pseudostratified epithelium, similar to the tracheal epithelium.
This method of cell culture aims to be used to study fundamental aspects of the respiratory epithelium, such as cell-to-cell signaling, disease modeling, and respiratory regeneration.
Air-liquid interface cell culture compares to standard cell culture practices by specifically aiming to restore the pseudostratified striation of the respiratory airway "in vitro", and aiming to maintain the respiratory airway-niche of (from top to bottom) 1) air, 2) pseudostratified epithelium, and 3) liquid media. Standard cell culture processes are either non-airway specific, or revolve around an organ system that require other means of cellular maintenance "in vitro".
Protocol.
The protocol for air-liquid interface culture relies on two key steps: isolation of the epithelial cells from an organism, and culture of those cells
Isolation.
Organs with epithelial cells are isolated (dissected) and placed in PBS to clean any impurities and these isolated organs are digested using trypsin. After the digest, ROCK inhibitor (Rho-associated kinase inhibitor) is added to prevent cellular apoptosis of isolated cells. What is left is digested cellular content mixed with tissue; pronase/DNAse is added to clean up dead cellular material as well as any remaining protein material. The resulting material is chopped finely in media and individual isolated cell samples are placed in respectively marked microcentrifuge tubes, and shaken at 37 °C for 30 – 40 minutes. Once the cells have been incubated, they are plated onto transwell membranes for growth.
Culture.
Plate cells with SABM (Small Airway Basal Media) to enrich the cells with nutrients for the purpose of growth and eventual differentiation. Once the cells are plated, they are grown for 3–7 days under careful observation (while changing media each day) until desired confluence is reached.
More recently, a study on "In vitro" generation of type-II pneumocytes initiated from human CD34(+) stem cells has been demonstrated the air liquid interface cell culture method precisely.
Uses in scientific study.
Air-liquid interface cultures are used in many stem cell studies which aim to recreate a pseudostratified epithelium "in vitro". These studies can contribute to new findings in various topics:
Cancer.
In modeling cancer and various other diseases, the stem cells in the basal layer of the tracheal epithelium (basal stem cells) were isolated and used in developing 3D organoids that could be used for various studies, including tumor studies. The cell culture method used involves the isolation of cells into culturing with growth factors to grow over time. Once the cells had been grown, they were mixed with Matrigel and cultured to form 3D organoids.
Cell growth/differentiation.
In modeling the pseudostratified epithelium "in vitro", more cellular studies have been performed in order to determine the nature of the cells – their differentiation pathways, their growth mechanism, their repair/response mechanism in the state of post-injury.
One recent study has shown that differentiated cells in the respiratory epithelium (secretory cells and ciliated cells primarily) can dedifferentiate into their naive status, and become stem-like again.
Adapted protocol: maintenance of stem-like properties in basal stem cells.
As an adaptation to the air-liquid interface culture protocol, auxiliary protocols have been developed using the ALI framework to maintain naive stem cell properties for extensive periods of time.

2018 Peel Region municipal elections

Peel Region municipal elections, 2018, were part of the larger Ontario municipal elections, that took place on Monday, October 22.
After ballots were cast, Patrick Brown was elected as the mayor of Brampton, Bonnie Crombie re-elected as the mayor of Mississauga and Allan Thompson re-elected as the mayor of Caledon.
The election was intended to be the first ever direct election of the Peel Regional chair. However, the election of this position was cancelled after the Doug Ford government introduced The Better Local Government Act, 2018 (Bill 5) in August 2018.
Open races.
Jim Tovey, Mississauga councillor for Ward 1, died suddenly in January 2018. Tovey was in the midst of planning for massive waterfront redevelopment.
In February 2018, Brampton councillor Chris Gibson announced his retirement in Wards 1 &amp; 5. Officially a city councillor, he had been given the city's additional Regional seat for multiple terms. Regional councillor Elaine Moore, from the same wards, announced her retirement in late March.
Gael Miles retirement was made public the evening before the start of registration. Caledon's Doug Beffort retired.
Peel Region chair.
Original nomination process.
In 2016, the provincial Liberal government announced voters in the 2018 election would elect regional chairs. Across the province, the selection of regional chairs varies, with some regional councils electing chairs while other chairs being selected by councillors. Peel Region traditionally appointed the regional chair from existing councillors.
In early 2018, the candidates for the position of regional chair began to be nominated.
Starting the year "85% sure" he would run, Ron Starr officially announced his intention to run for Regional Chair in late March 2018. Later, after the cancellation of the position, Starr withdrew to run for re-election in Ward 6.
Rumours that were circulating of Patrick Brown running for Regional chair were neither confirmed or denied, when asked by Metroland in May 2018. Brown was accused of sexual misconduct in January, which he denies, forcing his resignation as Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario leader. He moved to Mississauga after being removed from the party caucus. He did not run for re-election as a Barrie MPP in the June provincial election. Patrick Brown also withdrew from the race.
Mississauga councillor Nando Iannicca enrolled in July.
Bob Delaney, former MPP for Mississauga-Streetsville, registered in July. Charles Sousa and Harinder Takhar, also former MPPs, agreed to not run, in an effort to not split the vote.
Registered candidates included:
A shift in Ontario's government after the provincial elections, saw Doug Ford announce the cancellation of the voter elected position of regional chair in Peel.
While this prompted Brown to pull his Chair nomination, to run for Mayor of Brampton, Delaney continued his campaign, noting that the law had yet to pass.
Incumbent Frank Dale has indicated he may change his mind on retirement, according to "The Mississauga News".
Appointment process.
TVO journalist Steve Paikin has heard suggestion of the following candidates:
Former Caledon Regional councillor Barb Shaughnessy, who had run for Mayor of Caledon, indicated that she would not be pursuing the position.
Brampton.
Brampton had 313,273 eligible voters during the 2018 election. A total of 169 voting locations were open across the city.
Mayor.
In October 2017, incumbent Brampton Mayor Linda Jeffrey announced her intent to run for a second term.
Real estate lawyer Wesley Jackson was noted in a February 2018 "Peel Daily News" article as "hoping to become Brampton's next mayor."
In July, John Sprovieri announced his intention to run for Mayor of Brampton. Omar Mansoury withdrew.
On Election Day on October 22, Patrick Brown was declared the winner.
Debates.
Brampton Board of Trade is hosting debates of city council candidates throughout the day on September 17, 2018, through live stream, concluding with a Mayoral debate. Brown, Gosal, Jackson, Jeffrey, and Sprovieri were invited to the event. Questions were pre-selected from membership. According to the "Guardian", the majority of the event saw "Brown and Sprovieri focusing much of their attention on Jeffrey's record and vice versa."
The first Mayoral debate to allow physical attendance will be held September 20, 2018, at Sheridan College, Davis Campus, through The Pointer, an online news outlet for Brampton.
Brampton Focus hosted a debate on September 25 at the Rose Theatre Brampton, inviting Jeffrey, Brown, Gosal, and Sprovieri. Media reports suggest that the debate was often drowned out by cheering and jeering.
A debate was held by the Brampton Real Estate Board on October 4. All candidates were in attendance.
Prime Asia TV Canada hosted a debate on October 18.

Ward 2.
The incumbent is Karen Ras. She was unopposed until the final week of nominations.
Ward 3.
The ward incumbent is Chris Fonseca.
Ward 4.
The ward incumbent is John Kovac.
Ward 5.
The Ward 5 incumbent is Carolyn Parrish.
Nikki Clarke was registered as a candidate, but disqualified. Clarke had waited until the last day of the nomination period to file her papers, and was soliciting signatures from City staff. This prompted incumbent Carolyn Parrish to ask for a review of the paperwork by the Clerk's department. A total of 8 discrepancies were found in signatures, and the nominee was not allowed to replace those signatures. Clarke came a close second in the 2018 provincial election, running for the NDP in Mississauga—Malton.
Some of the candidates talked to the "Mississauga News" about issues important to them. Malton Community Building Project hosted a candidate event on October 9.
Ward 6.
Incumbent councillor Ron Starr was in his third term on council when on March 28 at a city council session he announced his intention to run for the newly elected Region of Peel Chair. Fourteen candidates entered the race to succeed Starr for the open seat with Joe Horneck being the first to register. July 23 one week before the filing deadline Starr decided to drop out of contention for Regional Chair with that race had 10 candidates including former PC leader Patrick Brown (now Brampton Mayor) and Starr re-registered for his incumbent ward, suggesting that he could do more in his existing position then as regional chair. 
Starr was successful in winning re-election with Ward 6 by a margin of 347 votes proving the closest contest in the city, even though two other wards had no incumbents. Mississauga News columnist John Stewart summarized the race by saying most of the city was a status quo election however "Horneck's loss is more politically impressive than most wins elsewhere. He almost unseated an entrenched council vet in a stable ward. As it is, he's Ward 6 councillor in waiting."
Tahir Ali, Syed Mohammad Jaffery, Fazli Manan, and Avtar Minhas have withdrawn.
Ward 7.
Incumbent councillor Nando Iannicca retired from this riding, and re-emerged later in the nomination period as a candidate for Chair of the Region of Peel.

Diocesan Museum (Naples)

The Diocesan Museum is the museum of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Naples, displaying paintings, reliquaries and bronzes previously housed in the Archepiscopal Palace, closed and suppressed churches in the Diocese (such as the churches of Santa Donna Regina Nuova and the neighbouring Santa Maria Donnaregina Vecchia) or churches where it is too risky to display artworks. The paintings are mainly from the Neapolitan School, including works by Luca Giordano, Francesco Solimena, Massimo Stanzione, Aniello Falcone and Andrea Vaccaro. 
It was originally housed in the Archepiscopal Palace but due to an initiative by cardinal-archbishop Crescenzio Sepe it re-opened in the rooms behind the chancel of Santa Donna Regina Nuova and on a new mezzanine floor above the side chapels of its nave on 23 October 2007. The rooms above the side chapels are organised thematically, with a room each for the Passion of Christ, the Seven Sacraments, Martyrdom, the Life of Priests, Monks and Mendicants and the Seven Works of Pity. Other rooms house objets-d'art, such as two bronzes of St Candida of Naples and St Maximus by Giovan Domenico Vinaccia from Naples Cathedral, reliquaries, vestments and sculptures in wood and stone.

FS Class E.321 (third rail)

FS Class E.321 was a class of 17 third-rail electric locomotives, built for the Italian State Railways (FS) for operation on the Varese line and on the underground line in Naples.
History.
The E.321 was an evolution and improvement of the previous FS Class E.320. Seventeen units were built by Officine Meccaniche (OM) of Milan, with electrical equipment by Tecnomasio Italiano-Brown-Boveri (TIBB), from 1923 to haul heavy passenger trains on the electrified line of the Milan - Varese - Porto Ceresio railway and for use on the so-called "subway" of Naples.
Construction.
The locomotive consisted of a single central box, following the typical design of the time, with cabs and control desks at each end. This was mounted on a rigid frame carried on three coupled axles with 1,500 mm driving wheels and a carrying axle on the typical Italian Zara bogie at each end. The wheel arrangement was 1′C1′. The electrical equipment was contained in the central body. Two direct current (DC) traction motors provided a total power of and the locomotive could reach a maximum speed of 95 km/h.
The design was almost the same as the E.320, but addressed the fragility of the E.320's mechanical rod transmission. The two motors, of similar but slightly lower power rating, were now set lower in the frame. This allowed the previous arrangement of steeply inclined coupling rods to intermediate jackshafts to be replaced by a lighter triangular rod on each side, similar to that used on the Italian three-phase locomotives, and no longer needing the jackshafts. The total weight of the locomotive in working order was 69 tonnes, of which 48 tonnes was adhesive. This was nearly three tonnes lighter than the E.320 and yet there was nearly a ton more adhesive weight.
They were painted in the typical khaki brown Castano-Isabella livery of Italian electric locomotives.
Preservation.
E.321.012 is preserved at the Museum of Science and Technology in Milan.

Akisho

The Akisho (Somali: "Akisho", Arabic: اكشو) is a sub-division of the Ali Madahweyne subclan of the Dir clan family. Famous people of the Akisho clan are Ahmed gurey, Arawelo and Oday Biiqay.
As a Dir sub-clan, the Akisho have immediate lineal ties with the Issa, the Gadabuursi, the Surre (Abdalle and Qubeys), the Biimaal (who the Gaadsen also belong too), the Bajimal, the Bursuk, the Gurgura, (the Quranyow sub-clan to be precise as they claim descent from Dir), Gariire, other Dir sub-clans and they have lineal ties with the Hawiye (Irir), Hawadle, Ajuraan, Degoodi, Gaalje'el clan groups, who share the same ancestor Samaale.
Overview.
Akisho is one of the oldest somali clans being mentioned as far back as the 16th century in the book "The Conquest of Abyssinia" also known as "Futuh al-habash". Akisho members are strict adherents of Sunni Islam. Akisho groups and their related clans are reputed to have migrated from Somali Ethiopian region all the way up North as far as the country Chad, the Sudan, and Northern Eritrea are said to be inhabited by Akisho and many Dir tribes.
Distribution.
The Akisho inhabit both the Somaliland and Ethiopia in Somali region. In Somaliland, Akisho members live in the Maroodi Jeex region, in the cities and towns of Hargeisa, Arabsiyo, Wajaale, Allaybaday, and Gabiley In Ethiopia, where the Akisho are among the most widespread Somali group, Akisho members inhabit Jijiga, Dire Dewa, Bale (Nagelle), Babile, Fayanbiro, Qabri-Bayah, Fiq, Hara-Maaya, Harar, Obra, and Dadar. Fadeyga godanta booraale gursum and many more geographical regions. Currently, the sultan of the Akisho clan is Muhiyadiin Odawa.
Also the Madahweyne Dir, Akisho clan is one of the largest Dir sub-clans within the borders of the Somaliland region of Ethiopia based on the Ethiopian population census. Many Akisho's live in the Afar region of Ethiopia.
The Akisho live in Jijiga district where they make up a large part of the Kebri Beyah and Fafan Zone. The Dir-Madaxweyne Akisho, along with the Gurgura, Issa and Gadabuursi subclans of the Dir represent the most native and indigenous Somali tribes in Harar.
History.
The city of Dire Dawa was originally called Dir Dhabe and used to be part of Adal Sultanate during the medieval times and was exclusively settled by Dir clan which is a major Somali tribe. The Akisho name is originally derived from "Cayisho" which means, in old Somali, the (Cayilsan) "Fat One." The Gurre and Gurgurre both are very closely related to the Akisho, use a nickname and were referred to the Oromo and Somalis as the traders or Gurgure from the old Somali and Oromo word "gorgortan" which means "one who sells and trades".
According to the folklore historians of the Southern Suure Dir of the Mudug region, the Akisho and gurre and the Gurgure madahweyne Dir produced some of the most famous Somali folk heroes like the Somali queen Araweelo who was Warre Miyo. Also the Akisho and Gurgure clans were instrumental in spreading the Muslim faith in the hinterlands of Ethiopia. The Sheikh Abba Hussein in Southern Ethiopia is said to be of Dir, as well as Awbarkadleh and Awbuube who are two major saints of the Somalis.
Currently Muhiyadiin Odowa is the Sultan of the Akisho.
The information in contained in this Response was provided by Matt Bryden, a consultant and Somali specialist now working with the United Nations Institute for Research on Social Development (UNRISD) in Nairobi (16 June 1998). He stated that the Akisho "are related to the Dir clan family, and live mainly between Jigjiga [in Ethiopia], Hargeysa and many regions in Ethiopia. In Somalia, they have been awarded a seat in the constituent assembly. They face no threat of persecution in any of the areas in which they live." The Research Directorate was unable to corroborate the Akisho's participation in the constituent assembly nor whether they face "persecution."
According to the Ethiopian Review the Akisho may be more numerous in Ethiopia than they are in Somalia (30 Apr. 1996). For additional information on the Dir clan and the Akisho sub clan, please consult Patrick Gilkes' The Price of Peace: Somalia and the United Nations 1991–1994 pages 144–148, and the appendix of Somali clan families.
Clan tree.
The Akisho clan consists of 12 major sub-clans:
There is no clear agreement on the clan and sub-clan structures and many lineages are omitted. The following listing is taken from the World Bank's "Conflict in Somalia: Drivers and Dynamics" from 2005 and the United Kingdom's Home Office publication, "Somalia Assessment 2001".

Constant routine protocol

A constant routine protocol is a common method used in human circadian rhythm research to study internally generated, or endogenous, circadian rhythms without the effect of external, or exogenous, influences. In the method, subjects are kept in constant conditions for at least 24 hours. These include constant light and temperature, as well as constant semi-recumbent posture. In addition, subjects' food intake is evenly distributed throughout the protocol, and subjects are typically not allowed to sleep for the duration. While in these conditions, subjects are often assessed for a number of variables of interest. Two of the most common and best understood of these variables are core body temperature and melatonin.
History.
The term was first coined by in 1978 after it was used in an experiment to determine the effects of jet lag independent of an individual's behavioral cycle - though the methods involved in a constant routine date back to at least 1947.
The protocol arose from the well established concept in circadian research that the observation of organisms under constant conditions allows for the illumination of endogenous rhythms, as first described by French scientist Jean-Jacques d'Ortous de Mairan in 1729. In contrast to previous methods, however, the constant routine protocol was developed upon the recognition that several key behaviors exhibiting circadian rhythmicity (including sleep-wake cycle, the behavioral cycle, and the food-intake cycle) also act as masking agents of some endogenous rhythms.
Discoveries.
The constant routine protocol, because of its ability to drastically reduce the masking effect of exogenous influences on the circadian pacemaker, has yielded invaluable results in the literature over the last 40 years of its use. Some of these achievements include accurate characterization of the endogenous components of the diurnal rhythms of melatonin, core body temperature, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), glucose tolerance, heart rate, and cognitive performance, among others.
Drawbacks.
Constant routine protocols have been criticized due to evidence that the conditions necessary for the protocol themselves influence the circadian clock. Sleep deprivation and constant dim lighting may mask the endogenous clock or affect circadian phase. For example, it has been demonstrated previously that sleep deprivation itself has an effect on heart rate rhythms as measured by EEG. In addition, it has been suggested that sleep deprivation and the constant routine protocol may themselves effect the circadian phase of the participant, based on research done in hamsters.

List of ancient Greek monetary standards

A wide variety of different monetary standards were used by different ancient Greek city-states for their silver coinage. These standards differed in the weight of the main monetary unit and also in the denominational structure of the coinage. Modern numismatists have assigned names to these standards, based on the most prominent city-state that minted on them or the region where they are most common. 
Each standard was based on a single unit: usually a stater or a drachm. All other denominations in the system would be multiples or subdivisions of that unit. In practice individual coins tend to vary from their ideal weights, due to a lack of precision during manufacture and the loss of weight over time through wear.
Some standards were restricted to a few city-states; others, notably the Attic-Euboean standard, became very widespread. Weight standards tended to decline over time, because mints sought to profit by producing coins that were slightly lighter than their nominal weight, and because the weight of new coins was often based on the weight of coins already in circulation, which had lost weight through wear. 
Many of these standards derived from systems of weight that existed in individual city-states when they began to use coinage in the sixth and fifth centuries BC. Others arose over time as a result of weight reductions and weight adjustments. Most Greek states had ceased to mint silver coinage by the reign of Augustus, but a few standards continued in use throughout the Principate, like the cistophori.

Sarah Godlewski

Sarah Ann Godlewski (born November 9, 1981) is an American businesswoman and politician who has served as Wisconsin state treasurer, since 2019. She was elected in 2018, defeating Republican Travis Hartwig.
On April 14, 2021, she announced her campaign in the 2022 United States Senate election in Wisconsin.
Early life and career.
Sarah Godlewski was born in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and graduated from Memorial High School. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in peace and resolution studies from George Mason University, where she was student body president. During that time, she helped to successfully lobby the Virginia Legislature to pass absentee ballot reforms. Later, she attended the University of Pennsylvania's Fels Institute of Government, but did not complete her degree. In April 2021, the "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel" reported Godlewski does not have a master's degree in public policy from the University of Pennsylvania despite several publications and websites claiming she had the degree.
Career.
She was a National Security Fellow for Air War College and attended the Women's Campaign School at Yale University. Godlewski has also been involved as an interviewer with the Veterans History Project.
In 2016, Godlewski served as the Director of Women's Outreach for Wisconsin in Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, but did not vote in the election. Five years later, her campaign for US Senate said she hadn't voted because she was unsure if she met residency requirements, though in fact she did meet the requirements, and Wisconsin has same day voter registration.
Godlewski also taught as an adjunct professor at George Mason University between 2004 and 2009.
Godlewski worked for Arapahoe County, Colorado from 2012 to 2016 as the director of the Office of Strategy and Performance. During that time, Godlewski served as a member of the Joint Task Force on Veterans with PTSD which made recommendations to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the United States Congress.
Godlewski's career has led her to work on community Microfinance in India, language and culture strategic planning for the United States Department of State, child protection initiatives in Belize, education reform and public health in Uganda, and social policy work in Sweden. Between 2004 and 2012, Godlewski worked for defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton as a lead associate. She has claimed that she saved taxpayers millions of dollars in that role, but was unable to prove those numbers when they were investigated by the "Milwaukee Journal Sentinel". In 2015, Godlewski co-founded investment firm MaSa Impact with her husband Max Duckworth, a multimillionaire investor from Maryland.
Godlewski served on the board for the U.S. Fund for UNICEF and served as chairperson of the UNICEF Advocacy Committee. In addition to her leadership role with UNICEF, Godlewski served on the board for mOm Incubators, the Arlington Academy of Hope, and George Mason University's School of Visual and Performance Arts. Godlewski has also been an investor with WE Capital. In the past, Godlewski has helped to direct Women's Leadership programs for the Democratic National Committee.
Wisconsin state treasurer.
Campaign.
In April 2018, Godlewski announced her candidacy for state treasurer. Godlewski won a three-way primary on August 14, 2018, receiving 43.5% of the vote. Her opponents were former television anchor Cynthia Kaump and former Treasurer Dawn Marie Sass. She ran on a platform of restoring the office, ensuring transparency and accountability, and pursuing a win-win investment strategy.
Godlewski raised over $700,000 for her campaign, while Travis Hartwig, her Republican opponent, raised less than $13,000. Godlewski and her husband contributed over $300,000 to her own campaign. She won the general election with 50.9% of the vote, to Hartwig's 46.8%.
Tenure.
After being elected, Godlewski received a memo from the Legislative Reference Bureau that identified 16 responsibilities that the State Treasurer should be doing but had neglected in recent years. During the transition for Governor-elect Tony Evers, Godlewski was appointed to serve as a member of the Next Generation Workforce and Economic Development Policy Advisory Council. In January 2019, Godlewski was unanimously elected to serve as chairwoman of the state Board of Commissioners of Public Lands. In August 2019, Godlewski and Governor Evers established a Retirement Task Force to create new investment options and expand awareness of retirement planning in Wisconsin. In February 2021, the Task Force presented its results to Governor Evers. Its recommendations include five proposals: WisconsinSaves, 401(K)ids, Emergency Savings, Incentivize Participation, Interactive E-Commerce Portal. In March 2020, Godlewski created the Treasurer's Homeowners Task Force to make it easier for Wisconsinites to buy a home and to stay in their homes. In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, she utilized her role as the chair of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands to release an additional $5.25 million to aid in virtual learning on top of a record $38.2 million to public school libraries.
2022 U.S. Senate election.
On April 14, 2021, Godlewski announced her campaign in the 2022 United States Senate election in Wisconsin.

United Airlines Flight 1175

On February 13, 2018, around noon local time, a Boeing 777-222 airplane, operating as United Airlines Flight 1175 (UA1175), experienced an in-flight separation of a fan blade in the No. 2 (right) engine while over the Pacific Ocean en route to the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport (HNL), Honolulu, Hawaii. During level cruise flight shortly before beginning a descent from flight level 360, and about 120 miles from HNL, the flight crew heard a loud bang, followed by a violent shaking of the airplane, followed by warnings of a compressor stall. The flight crew shut down the failed engine, declared an emergency, and began a drift-down descent, proceeding direct to HNL where they made a single-engine landing without further incident at 12:37 local time. There were no reported injuries to the 374 passengers and crew onboard and the airplane damage was classified as minor under National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) criteria.
NTSB investigators traveled to the scene to begin an incident investigation. They found a full-length fan blade fracture in the No. 2 (right) engine, a Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) PW4077 turbofan. Its installed set of hollow-core fan blades had undergone two previous overhauls at P&amp;W that included a thermal acoustic imaging (TAI) internal inspection that is intended to prevent this type of failure. The right engine nacelle lost most of the inlet duct and all of the left and right fan cowls immediately after the engine failure. Two small punctures were found in the right side fuselage just below the window belt with material transfer consistent with impact from pieces of an engine fan blade. The damage was eventually repaired and the aircraft returned to service. Improved procedures for TAI inspection were implemented by P&amp;W, increased frequency of TAI inspection was required by regulators, and a redesign of the inlet duct was also initiated by Boeing, all as a result of this incident and investigation.
Aircraft.
The aircraft involved was a Boeing 777-222, the United Airlines specific variant of the original 777-200 series, registration N773UA, ( 26929 and line number 4. It was equipped with two Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines and was 23.3 years old, having made its first flight on October 28, 1994. It was delivered new to United Airlines on September 29, 1995. Boeing stopped building the 777 with P&amp;W PW4000 series engines in 2013, and the engine is no longer in active production.
The Boeing 777 is a long-range, wide-body, twin-engine aircraft. At the time of the incident it had a relatively low accident fatality rate. The only two 777 accidents with total loss of aircraft, passengers and crew are Malaysia Airlines flights MH17 that was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014 and MH370 that disappeared over the Indian Ocean in March 2014. The other fatal accidents, Emirates Flight 521 and Asiana Airlines Flight 214, were both were attributed to pilot error. Two other hull losses with passenger injuries occurred: EgyptAir Flight 667 had a cockpit fire while parked at the gate at Cairo Airport, and British Airways Flight 38 crashed on landing at Heathrow Airport. But the latter was attributed to a design defect in its Rolls-Royce Trent 895-17 engines, not the P&amp;W engines on this incident aircraft.
Engine.
The original 777-200 was distinctive for its Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 engines that are about as wide as a 737 fuselage. The PW4077 variant used on the United 777-222 nominally produces of thrust. It is a dual-spool, axial-flow, high bypass turbofan engine,
that is a higher bypass version of the PW4000-94 engine originally fitted to the Boeing 747-400. It was re-designed exclusively for the 777 with a larger diameter fan section using 22 hollow core fan blades. The PW4000-112 fan blade is a wide chord airfoil made of a titanium alloy, about long and about wide at the blade tip. A PW4000-112 fan blade can weigh a maximum of .
Incident.
The flight departed SFO on time and the push back, taxi, takeoff, and climb were normal. There were three pilots on the flight deck: Captain Christopher Borzu Behnam, who was the pilot monitoring, First Officer (FO) Paul Ayers, who was the pilot flying, and a jump seat rider, who was off-duty United Airlines 777 First Officer Ed Gagarin. The captain, age 57, reported a total of 13,592 hours total time, with 360 hours in the B777. The first officer, age 60, reported a total of 11,318 hours total time, with 10,087 in the B777.
At the time of the fan blade out engine failure event, 11:58 Hawaiian standard time (HST), the flight was about 120 miles from HNL at flight level (FL) 360 when there was a violent jolt and very loud bang that both pilots stated was followed by extreme airframe vibrations. The pilots reported that immediately after the jolt and loud bang, the autopilot disconnected, and the airplane began to roll to the right. A positive exchange of controls was accomplished with the captain becoming pilot flying. The pilots stated that about 15 to 30 seconds after the jolt and loud bang, the Engine Indicating and Crew Alerting System (EICAS) showed that there was no engine pressure ratio (EPR), N1, or oil pressure. After accomplishing the Severe Engine Damage checklist, the crew shut down and secured the engine. The jump seat rider stated that after the right engine was shutdown, the vibration subsided although the controllability of the airplane was not normal. The crew declared an emergency and began a drift down descent to FL 230.
The captain directed the jump seat rider to go back into the cabin to assess the condition of the engine. The jump seat rider noted that the engine was oscillating and that the cowling was missing. He took a video of the engine to show the captain and the FO the engine's condition. The pilots reported that concurrently, the purser had come to the flight deck and the captain briefed her about the emergency and that they would be landing at HNL. The crew decided the most suitable airport in time, distance, and familiarity was HNL. The airplane continued to HNL and made a visual approach and landed on Runway 8R without further incident. The pilots stated that the aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) personnel inspected the airplane and when the airplane was determined to be safe, they taxied the airplane to the gate where the passengers deplaned normally. The 363 passengers, 3 pilots, and 12 flight attendants board deplaned normally at the gate and there were no injuries.
Cockpit Voice Recorder Timeline.
Selected events from the CVR (all times HST).
Investigation.
The examination of the airplane revealed a small hole along with several dents and gouges in the fuselage adjacent to the No. 2 engine. There were two small dents and punctures in the right side of the fuselage, below the window belt in the vicinity of seat rows 20 and 21. Subsequent laboratory examination of the skin surrounding the puncture found embedded particles of largely titanium and vanadium, which along with aluminum are the alloying elements of the fan blade material. There were also several dents in the right wing and the right-hand horizontal stabilizer.
The majority of the right engine inlet assembly was missing. All the inlet lip skin, the forward bulkhead, most of the inner and outer barrels, and about half of the rear bulkhead were not recovered. The majority of both inner and outer halves on the fan cowl were also missing. The missing parts were lost at sea. The left and right side thrust reversers, and the exhaust cowl were in place and intact.
Engine.
There was extensive damage to the interior surface of the fan case in the form of gouging and cracking. Although there were cracks in the case and the outer layer of the Kevlar wrap was split, there was no penetration of debris. The maximum deformation of the Kevlar environmental wrap was about 2.5-inches at about 3 o'clock. The location of the maximum deformation of the wrap was coincident with the approximately 34-inch long crack on the inside of the fan case.
Interior surfaces of the fan case and the remains of the inlet duct showed scratches and gouges that were in a spiral pattern across the fan case and front flange onto the inlet duct to the broken edge of the duct on the inboard area of the nacelle. The examination of the fan case showed that there were three distinct patterns of tracks along the flow path that appeared to spiral forward from the plane of the fan blades' leading edge across the A-flange on to the inlet duct's inner barrel.
Fan blade No. 11 was fractured transversely across the airfoil directly above the fairings that are between the base of each blade. The blade's fracture surface was flat with elliptical-shaped marks across the internal ribs and along the convex surface of the airfoil. The other fan blade, which was identified as fan blade No. 10 and was the adjacent trailing blade, was fractured across the airfoil about 24-inches above the fairings. Laboratory examination of fan blade No. 11 revealed a low cycle fatigue (LCF) fracture that originated on the interior cavity wall directly below the surface.
The metallurgical examination of the fractured fan blade was accomplished at P&amp;W's Materials Laboratory in the presence of members of the Powerplants Group as well as an NTSB metallurgist. The examination revealed a fatigue fracture that had initiated from a subsurface origin on the interior surface of the hollow core fan blade. The origin of the crack was in an area where the basal planes of the crystals were all similarly aligned and were almost perpendicular the localized stress field when the fan blade was formed. The examination also revealed that the fan blade's material conformed to the specified titanium alloy's requirements.
The installed set of fan blades, including the fractured fan blade, had undergone two overhauls at which time the blades underwent a thermal acoustic imaging (TAI) inspection. At the initial TAI in 2010, there was a small indication at the location of the origin of the crack. The review of the records from the 2015 TAI show that there was a larger indication in the same area as where there was an indication in 2010 and from where the crack originated. At the time of each TAI, the inspectors attributed the indication to a defect in the paint that was used during the TAI process and allowed the blade to continue the overhaul process and be returned to service. Because of this United Airlines fan blade separation incident and the finding that the fractured fan blade
had a rejectable indication at the previous TAI, P&amp;W initiated an over-inspection and reviewed the TAI inspection records for all 9,606 previously inspected PW4000 112-inch fan blades.
The training that was provided to the inspectors was primarily on-the-job training (OJT). The review of the TAI process revealed several issues with the inspectors’ training as well as with the inspection facility that could adversely impact the inspection. P&amp;W has advised that it was working to correct those issues. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Engine Certification Office (ECO) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would mandate the accomplishment of initial and repetitive TAI inspections on PW4000 112-inch fan blades.
Airframe.
The inlet is a cantilevered structure that directs the airflow into the engine fan case in a controlled and uniform manner. The inlet consists of two concentric cylinders (the inner and outer barrels) joined by forward and aft bulkheads and a lip skin. The inlet aft bulkhead was constructed of Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) on the production airplanes. During engine fan blade out (FBO) certification testing the inlet cowl construction consisted of an aluminum bulkhead. The inlet is bolted to the forward end of the fan case though an attach ring using 44 bolted connections. Loads and displacements resulting from a FBO are transferred between the inlet and the engine fan case though the attachment bolts and the attachment ring.
Because the aluminum versus the CFRP structure has the ability to yield while absorbing the same amount of energy, it can redistribute the FBO loads between the fan case and the inlet without causing failure to the inlet, or the fan case to inlet interface. The inlet and fan cowl structural analyses showed that the CFRP aft bulkhead design was less capable than the aluminum bulkhead that was tested during engine certification test and determined that multiple possible scenarios could have led to their separation:
The fan cowls are two cylindrical halves located aft of the inlet that enclose the engine fan case and the external engine accessories which provides a smooth aerodynamic surface over the core of the engine fan case. The fan cowls are supported on the forward end by the inlet and on the aft end by the thrust reverser. Additionally, the fan cowls are attached to the fan cowl support beam using four hinges (total of eight) at the top and latched (four latches) at the bottom to allow for the fan cowls to be opened for maintenance.
The engine is certified under Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) part 33 regulations. To comply with the regulations, the engine successfully demonstrated containment and safe shutdown of an engine after intentional fracture of a fan blade at redline speed. Although it is necessary to install an inlet for proper engine operation during these tests, it is not required that this inlet meet production standards. The test inlet used was of a different design which included an aluminum aft bulkhead instead of the production CFRP aft bulkhead. Additionally, these tests are conducted without the fan cowls attached. The inlet and fan cowls are certified under FAR Part 25 of which Boeing was responsible for.
On June 30, 2020, more than two years after the incident, The NTSB determined the probable cause(s) of this incident to be:
Reactions.
Pictures and video of the damaged engine were posted to social media by passengers, and of the landing by an observer on the ground. A closer look at the damaged engine showed that it was missing a fan blade.
Subsequent action.
United Airlines planned to fully refund all of the passengers' tickets.
On July 18, 2019, the cockpit crew was awarded the Superior Airmanship Award by the Airline Pilots Association for safely landing the plane.
In 2019 the FAA issued an airworthiness directive mandating recurring engine inspections based on usage cycles, and at that time stated "these thresholds provide an acceptable level of safety". The 6500 flight cycle fan blade inspection interval adopted by the FAA was also adopted and used by other national authorities, until Japan's transport ministry ordered increased inspection frequency after the similar JAL 777-200/PW4000 engine failure incident at Naha Airport (OKA) in Japan on December 4, 2020.
On February 12, 2020, a resident of California and Guam who was a passenger on the flight filed suit in the Superior Court of Guam seeking over $1 million each from United, the Boeing Company and Pratt &amp; Whitney for severe mental and emotional injuries, including post-traumatic stress disorder, in addition to physical injuries. The lawsuit cites statements made by the Captain to the press including a description of the sensation after the engine failure as, "the aircraft experiencing what felt like 'hit[ting] a brick wall at 500 miles an hour'".
In August 2020, Boeing provided an update to the FAA on its work to also strengthen 777 engine covers. The manufacturer told regulators it had decided to redesign and make replacement covers with which airlines could retrofit their fleets, according to the FAA document. This document was not made public until the contents of internal Boeing documents reviewed by the Wall Street Journal were first published immediately after a similar incident occurred with United Airlines Flight 328 in Denver in 2021.
At the NTSB press briefing two days after the similar United Airlines Flight 328 incident, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said it remained to be seen whether that engine failure is consistent this previous incident. "I think what's important is that we really truly understand the facts, circumstances, and conditions around this particular event before we can compare it to any other events," he noted. "But certainly we will want to know if there's a similarity."

Fullest

Fullest is the fourth single by independent American rapper Cupcakke from her third studio album Ephorize.
Background.
The song was first released on January 5, 2018 on her album. The rapper announced via Instagram that if her post received 5,000 comments, she would release the video for "Fullest".
Composition.
Madeline Laguaite from "The Red &amp; Black" described the song as "a fun, fast-paced song that takes certain elements common to Latin music and incorporates them into the track. CupcakKe is full of confidence and self-assurance throughout the song, with lines like 'You can't ever make me look foolish' and 'my bank account look the fullest.' The track winds down with the post-chorus and a claim that 'them bitches still ain't the fullest.'" Jazz Scott from "Tiny Mix Tapes" claimed it to be bossa nova.
Music video.
Harris released the music video for "Fullest" via her YouTube channel on February 20, 2018. Salvatore Maicki from "The Fader" described it as "vibrant and gloriously gaudy in all the ways a CupcakKe video should be" and went on to say "the 'Fullest' visual shows what really goes down when CupcakKe throws a house party— and what happens to sloppy uninvited guests." Dennis Hinzmann from "Out" wrote that "the rapper shows us what a house party for the Instagram generation looks like. Millennial pink palette: check. Inflatable pool animal: check. Neon backlighting to ensure everyone finds their best angle: check" and goes on to say "the party bumps around the rapper. That is, until some messy, uninvited guests show up. A coordinated withering glare followed by beachballs and squirt guns eject the would-be crashers, so the party can go on."

Alexander Berulava

Alexander (Sasha) Berulava () (11 November 1945 – 27 September 1993) was a Georgian journalist, writer, and human rights activist, founder of the Georgian Television of Abkhazia, who was murdered by Abkhaz separatists during the ethnic cleansing of Georgians in Abkhazia in 1993 together with other members of the Government of Abkhazia.
Alexander Berulava was born on 11 November 1945 in Sukhumi, Georgia. Berulava graduated from the Tbilisi State University, Faculty of Journalism.
Berulava joined the Council of Ministers and the Council of Self-Defense of Abkhazian Autonomous Republic during the Georgian-Abkhazian War in 1993 and served as the head of Military Press-Center. When the city of Sukhumi fell to the Abkhaz separatists on 27 September 1993, Berulava along with other authorities from the Government of Abkhazian Autonomous Republic (Zhiuli Shartava, Raul Eshba, Mamia Alasania, Guram Gabiskiria and others) refused to leave the besieged city and was captured by Abkhaz militants and North Caucasian volunteers.
Based on video materials, Human rights documents and witness accounts of the event, Berulava, Gabiskiria, Shartava, Eshba and other members of the government were dragged outside of the parliament building and forced to knee by the Abkhaz/North Caucasian militants. Berulava is not seen on the video, though according to the testimony of his friends, he refused to surrender and always kept a bullet and a F1 grenade in case of his capture (He was already captured by Abkhazian forces at the beginning of conflict and was tortured in Gudauta).
All captured members of the government including Berulava were murdered by the Abkhaz militants.
The President of Georgia Giorgi Margvelashvili awarded Alexander Berulava with the Vakhtang Gorgasali Order First grade order for his courage and heroism in the fight for the protection of the homeland and its territorial integrity.

Spencer Davis (racing driver)

Spencer Scott Davis (born November 29, 1998) is an American professional stock car racing driver who competes in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 11 Toyota Tundra for his own team Spencer Davis Motorsports.
Racing career.
Early years.
Davis began to race in the go-kart ranks when he was six years old. From there, he progressed into late model cars and trucks. He won many championships around the Southeast United States. In 2014, aged 15, Davis ran the full NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour schedule with backing from Coors Light. He ran a partial schedule in both the Southern Modified Tour and the main NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour in 2015 while also driving a partial NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West schedule.
Developmental series.
After finding limited success in modifieds, Davis transitioned to the NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series East in 2015, driving for NTS Motorsports. After a restricted schedule that year, he found a ride with Ranier Racing with MDM for the 2016 season. Davis found victory lane for the first time at Dominion Raceway in May of that year. The deal with Ranier eventually collapsed, and Davis spent the remainder of the year driving for his family team, Jefferson Pitts Racing and Hattori Racing Enterprises. He was also named to the 2016–2017 NASCAR Next class.
On February 11, 2017, Davis signed with Venturini Motorsports to run seven ARCA Racing Series events in 2017 after testing with the team at Daytona International Speedway. His first race was at Talladega Superspeedway. After scoring a top-five in his first race, Davis found the top ten in three of his other six starts. He also ran premier late model events.
Balancing a NASCAR Camping World Truck Series schedule in 2018, Davis wound up running a partial schedule in the K&amp;N East for Danny Watts Racing, which operated in conjunction with Rette Jones Racing. Expanding on that, Davis and RJR announced a full K&amp;N East slate for 2019. At World Wide Technology Raceway in August, Davis earned his first win with RJR and first in three-plus years, passing Sam Mayer on a late green-white-checkered restart.
NASCAR.
On January 23, 2018, it was announced that Davis would compete for Kyle Busch Motorsports, splitting time between the team's Nos. 4 and 51 entries. as part of the announcement, he was named as the driver of the No. 51 in four races and the No. 4 for a race, including the first three races of the season between the Nos. 51 and the 4. In his first race at Daytona International Speedway, Davis posted a seventh-place finish.
In 2019, Davis ran a limited slate with K&amp;N team Rette Jones Racing but also joined Niece Motorsports for the summer race at Chicagoland Speedway in the Truck Series.
For 2020, Davis started his own team, Spencer Davis Motorsports. The team competed in most of the races during the first half of the 2020 NASCAR Gander RV &amp; Outdoors Truck Series season, fielding the No. 11 Toyota with Davis behind the wheel. On August 6, Davis revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and would miss the Henry Ford Health System 200, scheduled for the following day.
In January 2021, Spencer Davis Motorsports announced Davis would run the full Truck season in the No. 11. On March 20, it was announced that Davis acquired the owner's points of NEMCO Motorsports. After failing to qualify at Daytona, they were not entered into the Daytona RC. The team still wants to run a majority of the schedule.
Spotting.
During 2019, Davis dipped his toe into spotting, helping Niece Motorsports driver Kyle Benjamin in the Gander Outdoors Truck Series.
Personal life.
Davis was homeschooled in order to maintain a flexible racing schedule. Spencer Davis grew up in Dawsonville, Georgia, the son of Scott Davis and Cynthia Davis. His father, Scott Davis, runs a poultry equipment business in Dahlonega.

Paracletus cimiciformis

Paracletus cimiciformis is a species of aphid with a complex life cycle. Its primary host plant is "Pistacia" and its secondary host is a grass, where it is present on the roots. Here it is associated with an ant and part of its life cycle is spent in the ant's nest.
Hosts.
The primary host for this species is the terebinth or turpentine tree ("Pistacia terebinthus"). Its secondary hosts include the grasses and cereals bent, wild oat, cock's-foot, fescue, wall barley, barley, rice, meadow-grass, "Polypogon viridis", tall fescue, "Stipa capensis" and wheat.
Distribution.
"Paracletus cimiciformis" is native to much of Europe and has been recorded in North Africa and Asia.
Life cycle.
The life cycle of "P. cimiciformis" is complex. For most of the year, wingless females are produced parthogenetically, but in the late summer on their secondary hosts (grass), winged males and females are produced which fly to their primary host, the terebinth tree. Here they mate and overwintering eggs are laid. In the spring these hatch and the wingless females that develop create swollen galls on the leaves; they live in these galls and reproduce asexually. In late summer some winged females develop which fly off and colonise the roots of grasses. Some of these aphids are carried into their nests by ants, where they overwinter, emerging in the spring to recolonise the roots of their secondary hosts, the whole cycle taking two years.
Ecology.
Although "Pistacia" is the primary host plant, this aphid is present in parts of Europe where this tree does not grow, and in these localities, the insect stays on the roots of the secondary host all year round. On grasses, it is always found living in association with ants in the genus "Tetramorium" such as the pavement ant, "Tetramorium caespitum" and "Tetramorium semilaeve".
On its secondary host, the aphids have two genetically identical forms. One of these has a rounded green body and sucks the sap of the host plant; it produces honeydew which is consumed by the ants, and in fact the ants herd the aphids and stimulate them to produce honeydew. The other form has a flattened brown body and produces pheromones which mimic those produced by ant larvae. When approached by an ant these flattened aphids remain stationary and get carried into the ant nest and deposited among the ant brood. Here they proceed to prey on the ant larvae, piercing them with their stylets and sucking out the hemolymph. They stay in the ant nest during the winter, and in the spring are carried to near the surface of the ground with the ant's own young. Here they produce round-bodied aphids which proceed to feed on grass roots and reproduce asexually. Both round-bodied and flattened morphs can reproduce parthogenetically, producing either form of offspring, and it is unclear what factors trigger the production of one morph in preference to another.

Pinus yorkshirensis

Pinus yorkshirensis is an extinct species of pine tree. The fossil pine cone came from Hauterivian and Barremian-aged sedimentary rocks located in the Speeton Clay in Yorkshire (hence the species epithet).
Discovery and naming.
The type specimen of "Pinus yorkshirensis" was discovered during a field trip at the University of Birmingham. It is one of four known fossil pine cones from Europe. It was 5 million years older than the previous record holder, "Pinus belgica".
The fossil was destroyed for science so scientists could study the fossil in more detail. All that remains are a few microscope slides and a single image. They are currently housed at Lapworth Museum of Geology.

The Kids Are Alright (album)

The Kids Are Alright is the debut studio album by American R&amp;B duo Chloe x Halle. It was released on March 23, 2018, by Beyoncé's record label Parkwood Entertainment. The album features guest collaborations from rappers GoldLink, Kari Faux and Joey Bada$$. The album earned them their first two career Grammy Award nominations for Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best New Artist for the 61st Grammy Awards.
The album is primarily a R&amp;B album, although it features elements of trap. The album was supported by the title track, released as the lead single on January 3, 2018. Along with fourteen new songs, the album also featured "Grown", the track recorded by the duo that serves as the theme song for the American comedy series "Grown-ish", as well as two songs from their 2016 EP "Sugar Symphony". The song "Warrior" was featured in "A Wrinkle in Time".
To promote the album, the duo performed the album track "Happy Without Me" and "The Kids Are Alright" on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!", and released a 10-minute short film named after the album.
Background.
Chloe and Halle Bailey began work on the album "three years ago, since before our EP, and before our mixtape." In an interview with "Time", the girls mentioned Beyoncé and Billie Holiday as inspirations for the record.
When asked about the title, Chloe said,"The title means so much to us; we’re speaking about ourselves as we’re growing into young women, telling ourselves we’re going to be OK. We’ll make mistakes and we’ll have obstacles, but we’ll overcome them. But then also in a general sense, with this generation and how the world has gone mad and all these crazy things that are left for this generation to handle, it’s just proclaiming that we will be alright no matter what, and they shouldn’t worry about us. I love being part of this generation because we’re not afraid to let our voices be heard, and we’re not afraid to speak our mind."
Critical reception.
The album received mostly positive reviews.
Writing for Refinery29, Courtney Smith stated, " Chloe X Halle write lyrics that address love, both universal and romantic, but do the latter from a place of power... It's a reminder to not underestimate or infantilize them simply because they are young."
Sydney Gore for MTV wrote, "Overall, this record is loaded with catchy bops, hardcore bangers and beautiful ballads with uplifting messages that will surely turn into anthems for various experiences in your personal life."
Briana Younger, writing for Pitchfork said about the album, "The Beyoncé-approved sister act are fearless on their debut album, reshaping pop and R&amp;B in their own images until even the highest-profile co-signs seem beside the point... Listening to their debut, it’s easy to believe that if God spoke, she would sound like Chloe x Halle." Pitchfork rated the album 7.6 out of 10.
Gabe Bergado wrote in a review of the album for Teen Vogue, "Within the first few minutes of listening to Chloe x Halle's debut album "The Kids Are Alright", you'll be completely entranced by the sisters' dreamy vocals and electrifying beats."
Alex Zidel wrote for HotNewHipHop, saying, "[The album wows] many with impressive chemistry and an undeniable charm." Also listing "Happy without Me" as an album highlight, he wrote, "In a pairing that not many expected would sound this beautiful, Joey Bada$$ and Chloe x Halle makes for a fantastic collaboration... Joey complements the pair's voices as he raps seamlessly throughout his bars."
"The Kids Are Alright" film.
Immediately following the release of the album, the duo released a short film on YouTube named after the album. The film highlights six songs from the album, and features a guest appearance by Ashton Sanders. The film was directed by Cara Stricker, and written and creative directed by Kwasi Fordjour.

ONAP

ONAP (Open Network Automation Platform), is an open-source, orchestration and automation framework. It is hosted by The Linux Foundation.
History.
On February 23, 2017, ONAP was announced as a result of a merger of the OpenECOMP and Open-Orchestrator (Open-O) projects. The goal of the project is to develop a widely used platform for orchestrating and automating physical and virtual network elements, with full lifecycle management.
ONAP was formed as a merger of OpenECOMP, the open source version of AT&amp;T's ECOMP project, and the Open-Orchestrator project, a project begun under the aegis of the Linux Foundation with China Mobile, Huawei and ZTE as lead contributors. The merger brought together both sets of source code and their developer communities, who then elaborated a common architecture for the new project. 
The first release of the combined ONAP architecture, code named "Amsterdam", was announced on November 20, 2017. The next release ("Beijing") was released on June 12, 2018.
As of January, 2018, ONAP became a project within the LF Networking Fund, which consolidated membership across multiple projects into a common governance structure. Most ONAP members became members of the new LF Networking fund.
Overview.
ONAP provides a platform for real-time, policy-driven orchestration and automation of physical and virtual network functions that will enable software, network, IT and cloud providers and developers to rapidly automate new services and support complete lifecycle management.
ONAP incorporates or collaborates with other open-source projects, including OpenDaylight, FD.io, OPNFV and others.
Contributing organizations include AT&amp;T, Samsung, Nokia, Ericsson, Orange, Huawei, Intel, IBM and more.

Colonel James Henry Deakin (2 March 1823 – 23 September 1880) was a British Conservative Party politician and brewer.
He was elected MP for Launceston in the 1874 general election but was unseated just under three months later, owing to corruption, including allowing his tenants to "kill rabbits the eve of the election", causing a by-election. His son James Henry Deakin (junior) was elected in his place at the ensuing by-election.
In 1871, Deakin bought the Werrington manor from Wicklow MP William Wentworth FitzWilliam Dick, selling off much of the land and properties of the estate. In 1882, the manor and its lands were then purchased by John Charles Williams.
Deakin was an Honorary Colonel of the 33rd Lancashire Volunteers.

French Ship Vendome (1651)

The Vendôme was a 72-gun ship of the line of the French Royal Navy, the smallest ship to be classed as a First Rank ship in the French Navy. She was built at Brest Dockyard, designed and constructed by Laurent Hubac. She was nominally a three-decker, but in practice the upper deck was divided into armed sections aft and forward of the unarmed waist, making the upper deck equivalent to a quarterdeck and forecastle.
Service history.
The "Vendôme" began to go into commission in March 1665, began reconstruction at Brest Dockyard in August 1665, and became flagship of the Ponant (Atlantic) Fleet under "chef d'escadre" Abraham Duquesne on 29 April 1666.
Disposal.
Her name was technically altered to "Victorieux" on 24 June 1671, but this was not put into practice as she was condemned on 17 July 1671 and she became a careening hulk at Brest until condemned in 1679.

Kamal Haasan's unrealized projects

The following is a list of unproduced Kamal Haasan projects in roughly chronological order. During his long career, Indian film actor-director Kamal Haasan has worked on a number of projects which never progressed beyond the pre-production stage under his acting commitments or direction. Some of these projects fell into development hell or were officially cancelled.
1960s.
"Mangala Mangai".
"Mangala Mangai", starring Kamal Haasan as a child actor, has not been released.
1980s.
"Chamayam".
"Chamayam" is a 1981 Malayalam-language movie directed by Sathyan Anthikad and written by John Paul Puthusery. Kamal Haasan and Ambika were meant to star in the film, but the project was later shelved. The project was abandoned because of the death of producer Majendran, who has co-produced the 1981 film "Sambhavam".
"Raja Ennai Mannithuvidu".
In 1982, C. Rudhraiya began a venture titled "Raja Ennai Mannithuvidu", with Kamal Haasan playing younger brother to Chandrahasan. Sujatha was cast as the latter's wife and Sumalatha was to play Kamal's heroine. The story dealt with the conflict between the peacenik older brother and the Naxal leanings of the Kamal character. The film was shot simultaneously in Telugu language. After 15 days shoot, this movie was shelved. One song recorded for the film by Ilaiyaraaja were later used in Mohan starrer "Anbin Mugavari" (1985).
"Top Tucker".
Directed by Bharathiraja, "Top Tucker" was to have starred Kamal Haasan and Radha. The project began in 1982 after the release of "Tik Tik Tik" (1981), and was briefly also referred to under the title of "Sivappu Sattai". After was canned, the film was shelved as Bharathiraja felt it was becoming too similar to his and Kamal's earlier film "Sigappu Rojakkal" (1978), and decided to collaborate with Kamal on a different film, which eventually became "Oru Kaidhiyin Diary" (1985).
"Khabardar".
Telugu director Tatineni Rama Rao started working on the film in 1984, which was a social drama centred upon a terminally ill patient and a doctor, produced by Poornachandra Rao. Kamal Haasan, Amitabh Bachchan, Sridevi and Jayaprada worked on the film which revolved around the notion of euthanasia. However, after shooting a substantial portion of the film, it was suddenly shelved.
In 1996, referring to the film under the working title of "Kanoon Ke Kathere Mein", Kamal Haasan revealed that he had completed most of his work on the film in a 25-day period. He was then told by the producers that they were unhappy with the output, and he mutually agreed to stop working on the project after receiving half his remuneration. In the early 1990s, the makers approached Kamal Haasan to finish the film but he refused citing other commitments. In 2020, K. Bhagyaraj stated that the film was stalled because Amitabh Bachchan had felt that the audiences would praise Kamal Haasan's portrayal rather than his, and subsequently asked to cancel the project.
Untitled adaptation of "The Godfather".
In the mid-1980s, Muktha Srinivasan planned to direct a film based on the American film "The Godfather" (1972) with Sivaji Ganesan, Kamal Haasan and Amala. He paid them an advance and confirmed their dates; however the project was dropped after Kamal Haasan's then associate Ananthu felt that it would be a Ganesan-focused film and not a Kamal film.
1990s.
"Athi Veerapandiyan".
In the early 1990s, Gangai Amaran agreed terms to direct a film titled "Athi Veerapandiyan" starring Kamal Haasan in the lead role. The film was based on jallikattu and Aishwarya was signed to portray the leading female role. However Kamal Haasan later opted out of the film and instead began work on another rural drama, "Thevar Magan" (1992), directed by Bharathan. He later credited Gangai Amaran for the idea of the song "Sandhu Pottu" from the film, which was initially meant for "Athi Veerapandiyan".
In 2016, Gangai Amaran alleged that his brother Ilaiyaraaja had effectively told Kamal Haasan to stop working on the project, during an ego clash between the two brothers.
"Ponniyin Selvan".
In an interview with "Filmfare" in January 1994, director Mani Ratnam stated that adopting Kalki Krishnamurthy's historical novel "Ponniyin Selvan" was one of his "dream projects" that he had hoped to work on during his career. Ratnam revealed that he worked on a first draft of the film alongside Kamal Haasan, who had bought the rights of the novel, but the pair shelved their plan as the project did not make financial sense at the time. Kamal Haasan then attempted to make the story into a forty-part television series, and worked with writer Ra. Ki. Rangarajan on the screenplay, but the project was later stalled.
"Kanden Seethaiyai".
Balachandra Menon wanted to remake his Malayalam film "Ammayane Sathyam" (1993) into Tamil, and turned down remake offers from other directors. Producer Raveendran signed on Kamal Haasan to do the film and recruited S. P. Balasubrahmanyam to take another role. The team initially approached Annie, who starred in the original to reprise her role as the lead female character, though her reluctance meant that the team picked newcomer Ruchita Prasad, who adopted a stage name of Jayasandhya.
The makers abandoned the project due to creative differences. It was later alleged that Kamal Haasan had wanted his role to be more prominent than the character from the original version. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on "Avvai Shanmughi" (1996), and recruited several members of the cast of "Kanden Seethaiyai" to work on his next project.
"Ladies Only".
A remake of the Tamil film "Magalir Mattum" (1994), the film is yet to have a theatrical release for unknown reasons. Produced by Kamal Haasan, "Ladies Only" is the story of three women, Seema Biswas, Shilpa Shirodkar and Heera Rajagopal working in the same office. They are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss Randhir Kapoor. The three decide to gang up against him to teach a lesson, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist, played by Kamal Haasan.
"Amaara Kaaviyam".
In the mid-1990s, Kamal Haasan worked on the script of a film titled "Amaara Kaaviyam", while working on "Ladies Only" and "Avvai Shanmughi" (1996). His wife at the time, Sarika, was expected to direct the film, while Nagma and Shilpa Shetty were reported to be a part of the cast. Kamal Haasan took a trip to the United States to learn about more filmmaking technology during the pre-production process. The film was subsequently never made.
"Marudhanayagam".
Kamal Haasan had been pondering directing a historical film for a period of four to five years, when writer Sujatha suggested that Kamal Haasan looked at a folk ballad edited by Tamil scholar Vanamamalai, which introduced them to the historical figure of Muhammed Yusuf Khan, an 18th-century warrior. Kamal Haasan immediately agreed at the prospect and felt that the story had all the potential of a good historical film, being appealed to by the elevation from the nadir to the top of Khan's life. Sujatha revealed that nearly 80% of the film would faithfully adapt Samuel Charles Hill's biography of Khan, also known as Marudhanayagam, and to only use imagination where no solid or substantial information is available.
The producers and Kamal Haasan managed to rope in Queen Elizabeth II to appear as the chief guest at the launch of the project which took place in the MGR Film City on 16 October 1997. The launch also saw the inaugural shot canned with Kamal Haasan, in the persona of Marudhanayagam, hearing and reacting to an imperial announcement read out by the character played by Nassar, with Om Puri's character looking on. Official filming began several months later in Velangudi on 10 August 1998 with a scene of where a companion of the lead character, played by Kamal Haasan, is hanged prompting a brief altercation.
Works on "Marudhanayagam" suddenly ceased after a British company that had planned to co-produce the film backed out and the film has been indefinitely postponed since. Haasan had invested 8 crores of his own wealth into the project through and has since revealed that the film would be revived at a future date. Since 1999, Kamal Haasan has consistently spoken of plans to revive the film.
"Londonil Kameshwaran".
Kamal Haasan had written the script of "Londonil Kameshwaran" and wanted to play the lead role in the late 1990s, but never got down to making it because he felt it would not have been cost-effective. Through the project, he had aimed to reprise his character of the Palakkad Brahmin cook Kameshwaran from "Michael Madana Kama Rajan" (1990) and place him in funny situations when he visits London. He had briefly considered making the film in early 1999 after "Marudhanayagam" had run into production troubles, but instead chose to prioritise his commitments for "Hey Ram" (2000). After the profitable "Pammal K. Sambandam" (2002), Mouli asked Haasan to re-collaborate with this particular script but Haasan was uninterested. Madhavan was selected by Haasan to replace him, after the pair had shot for "Anbe Sivam" together in the period, and the project was made under Haasan's production house with the title of "Nala Damayanthi" (2003).
2000s.
"Robot".
Following the completion of his first directorial venture in Hindi, "Nayak" (2001), S. Shankar announced his next project, "Robot", which was to feature Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta. The film was to be produced by the now-defunct company Media Dreams, a division of Pentamedia Graphics. The film was reported to be a futuristic techno-thriller set in Chennai in around 2200 or 3000 AD. Despite the completion of a photoshoot featuring Haasan and Zinta, the project was shelved as a result of scheduling conflicts with Haasan. Shankar consequently started work on "Boys" (2003). The film was eventually revived and released in 2010 as "Enthiran" starring Rajinikanth and Aishwarya Rai.
"Naran".
After completing the shoot of "Pammal K. Sambandam" (2002), Kamal Haasan signed on to appear in "Naran" directed by K. S. Ravikumar. Produced by Ravikumar's manager P. L. Thenappan and featuring music by A. R. Rahman, the film was launched with a small ceremony in November 2001. Kamal Haasan was reported to play the lead role of a character named Narayanan, abbreviated to "Naran". Reported to be a tale about a man and a beast, the team had also been in talks with Amitabh Bachchan to be a part of the film. Ravikumar noted the "get-up itself would be different one" and that the team were contemplating to make it simultaneously in Hindi and Telugu. The film was later put on hold due to budget issues and Kamal Haasan moved ahead to work on "Panchathanthiram" (2002) with Ravikumar and Thenappan.
"Krishna Leela".
In February 2004, Kamal Haasan and Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao began pre-production works on a project titled "Krishna Leela". The film was set to narrate the story of an individual called Krishna Das, played by Kamal Haasan, and the women in his life. The project was described as a comedy entertainer, much like the actor and director's previous collaborations in the 1990s. Abhirami and Gautami were reported to feature alongside him in a leading role, while actresses Rohini and Vinodhini were also cast in roles. Comedians including Goundamani, Vadivelu, Senthil, Vivek and Chitti Babu were also added to the supporting cast. Seeking to cast two new actresses, Kamal Haasan scouted for talent in London. The film was later dropped, and Kamal Haasan and Rao considered working together for a different project, "Mumbai Xpress" (2005).
"KG".
Kamal Haasan, Singeetham Sreenivasa Rao and Ramesh Aravind discussed the script of a film titled "KG" in early 2004, usually during Kamal Haasan's visits to Bangalore. Described as a "cop thriller" to be shot in Tamil and Kannada around Bangalore, Kamal Haasan revealed that there would be no female lead and that it would be "quite a change" from his other films. In a turn of events, Kamal Haasan accepted an offer to star in Saran's "Vasool Raja MBBS" (2004), and put "KG" on hold. He later continued to work on "KG", which marked Ramesh Aravind's directorial debut, and Mumbai-based financier Bharat Shah agreed to fund the film. The trio later decided to indefinitely postpone work on the project.
"Marmayogi".
"Marmayogi" was first pondered by Kamal Haasan after the release of "Aalavandhan" (2001), however nothing proceeded. After a four-year sabbatical from directing films since "Virumaandi" (2004), Kamal Haasan announced "Marmayogi" as his next project after the completion of "Dasavathaaram" (2008). The film was planned as a bilingual Hindi-Tamil period film, set in the 7th century. Production house Pyramid Saimira along with Haasan's company Raaj Kamal Films International were set to produce the venture, and work began in late 2007. Early media reports suggested a box-office battle between "Marmayogi" and Shankar's "Enthiran" (2010), which was rebooted from the shelved "Robot".
Pre-production on the film continued throughout 2008, with technicians such as Rajesh Selva and Sanu Varghese actively involved for close to a year. Meanwhile, Kamal Haasan grew a long, thick beard for the film. He also cast actresses Hema Malini, Trisha, Shriya Saran and Sushmita Sen in pivotal roles. Along with Trisha, Kamal Haasan held a photoshoot at the AVM Studios in August 2008. Following the failure of Rajinikanth's "Kuselan" (2008), Pyramid Saimira opted out of the project in November 2008, effectively shelving the film. Kamal Haasan subsequently moved on to begin work on "Unnaipol Oruvan" (2009), and later filed a legal complaint against Pyramid Saimira for loss of earnings.
"Thalaivan Irukkiraan".
The project was first reported in the media in November 2008 as Kamal Haasan's next project, after his historical drama "Marmayogi" was shelved as a result of Pyramid Saimira's financial problems. Titled "Thalaivan Irukkiraan" and described by "The Times of India" as an "action adventure" film, it was said to be directed by Kamal Haasan and co-produced by Gemini Film Circuit and Sun Pictures, with A. R. Rahman working as the music composer. Pre-production works continued throughout late 2008, with actors such as Rishi Kapoor, Mohanlal and Venkatesh approached for leading roles. Actresses Trisha and Shriya Saran, who were originally a part of "Marmayogi", were expected to be retained for the film in order to use the dates they had allotted for the shelved film. Kamal Haasan's Raaj Kamal Films International registered the film's title but production was postponed after a deal could not be agreed with the proposed co-producers. During the period, Kamal Haasan also pitched the idea of financing the film to Udhayanidhi Stalin of Red Giant Movies, who did not take up the offer citing that he felt the script was too political. He later used the dates offered by Mohanlal and Venkatesh for another of his productions, "Unnaipol Oruvan" (2009), which was incorrectly reported in the media as being the same project as "Thalaivan Irukkiraan". In November 2010, Kamal Haasan revealed that he was busy writing the final draft of the film and would look to start production by March 2011 with American producers. Actress Anushka Shetty was also reported to have accepted to star in the film during the period, but the film was again stalled.
In January 2012, the film resurfaced with Kamal Haasan confirming that the film would be simultaneously made in Hindi under the title of "Amar Hain". The media reported that the film would be produced by Aascar Ravichandran, with actors Mohanlal, Ajith Kumar, Ravi Teja and Katrina Kaif also in the cast, though this later proved to be untrue. Reports later in February 2012, suggested that Kamal Haasan had asked Shankar to direct the film, with Jackie Chan, Salman Khan, Prabhas and Asin amongst others speculated to be a part of the project. Chakri Toleti was also reportedly approached to be the film's director during July 2012, but the project still did not materialise. After three years of inactivity, in June 2015, Kamal Haasan announced that he was reviving the film and that Saif Ali Khan would feature alongside him in a leading role. Associating with Hindi producers Virender K. Arora and Arjun N. Kapoor, Kamal Haasan revealed that the project would be a "contemporary story, touching on politics, finance and the underworld" and "an action film with lots of emotion", while comparing the film to Brian De Palma's English film, "The Untouchables" (1987). He added that the film would be shot in Mumbai and Delhi in India, with schedules also planned in Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States, while also that he would finish scripting the film after he finished work on the production of "Thoongaa Vanam" (2015). Despite the announcements, the producers backed out of the project and the film was again stalled.
After two more years of inactivity, in July 2017, Kamal Haasan suggested that he would revive the project after the release of "Vishwaroopam 2" (2018) and "Sabaash Naidu". Following a further period of quiet, where Kamal Haasan also revealed that he would stop acting, it was announced that composer A. R. Rahman and studio Lyca Productions became attached to the project in July 2019.
"19 Steps".
In mid-2008, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to be a part of an Indo-Japanese production titled "19 Steps" to be directed by Bharat Bala. The film was written by Malayalam scriptwriter, M. T. Vasudevan Nair and was set to tell the tale of a Samurai warrior trying to conquer the ancient Indian martial art of Kalaripayattu. Starring alongside Asin and Tadanobu Asano, Kamal Haasan was set to play the role of an Indian martial arts guru. The film was being produced by Walt Disney and pre-production work had begun with large portions set to be shot in Kerala. Twenty days before the film began shoot, Kamal Haasan dropped out and the film was subsequently reported to be shelved indefinitely. As recently as 2016, Bharat Bala and producer Phillip Lee have expressed their desire to continue the film with a different cast.
"Buddham Sharanam".
In mid-2009, Kamal Haasan agreed terms to work with Mysskin on a film about Buddha, titled "Buddham Sharanam". Following the cancellation of "Marmayogi" and "19 Steps", Kamal Haasan was keen to work on a historical film with a similar theme, with the project also referred to in the media as "500 BC". He travelled to the United States to seek out production companies who were willing to fund the film, but no studio eventually agreed. Mysskin was then forced to drop the project and revealed it took him six months to get over the disappointment of the project's sudden end.
2010s.
"Tippuvum Unniaarchayum".
In September 2011, film producer Gokulam Gopalan announced that he would make a multilingual film on the life of Indian ruler Tipu Sultan. Featuring a script written by John Paul, Gopalan described Kamal Haasan as being the only choice for the titular role. The film was set to be directed by Vayalar Madhavan Kutty, and was scheduled to begin production in March 2012 and to be completed in a four-month long schedule. Set to be shot in Tamil and Malayalam, Gopalan announced that the story would also have extensive coverage of the warrior queen of North Malabar, Unniyarcha. Sridevi was amongst the actresses considered for the role.
In January 2012, Kamal Haasan confirmed that pre-production work was underway for the film, and that it would avoid taking a controversial political angle. However, the project was later shelved owing to inconsistencies with the script. Kamal Haasan consequently worked with producer Gopalan in "Thoongavanam" (2015) to settle the proposed agreement of working together on a film.
"Moo".
In late 2012, Hollywood producer Barrie Osborne expressed his interest in making an English film in association with Kamal Haasan, who would direct the project and feature in the lead role. The actor subsequently announced a project titled "Moo" in February 2013, which was said to be about three lives. A potential English title of "Triple Impact" was speculated, while other sources titled the film as "Yaavarum Kelir", with an English title of "All Are Kin". The project later failed to develop. In 2017, sources suggested that the film was still under consideration.
"Vaamamaargam".
In December 2014, in a public interaction on social media with his daughter Shruti Haasan, Kamal Haasan announced that he was working on a project tentatively titled "Vaamamaargam". Transliterated into English as "left-hand path", he suggested that the film's title was inspired by the Tamil terms given to aghoris and communists, before stating the film would be about "business ethics". He later clarified that the film was separate from "Marudhanayagam", though the film eventually did not develop into production.
"Amma Appa Vilayattu".
In November 2015, Kamal Haasan and T. K. Rajeev Kumar agreed to collaborate on a project and announced that they were working on a family drama script to be titled "Amma Appa Vilayattu" in Tamil and "Amma Naana Aata" in Telugu. After initial discussions with Sridevi failed to materialise, Rajeev Kumar cast Amala Akkineni and Zarina Wahab in pivotal roles and announced that the film would be shot entirely across the United States, with schedules in New York and Georgia. The film was later postponed and by early 2016, Kamal Haasan chose to collaborate with Rajeev Kumar on a different project that he had written himself, "Sabaash Naidu".
"Sabaash Naidu".
In early 2016, following the postponement of "Amma Appa Vilayattu", Kamal Haasan developed a story featuring the character of Balram Naidu, the RAW operative from his 2008 film "Dasavathaaram" for "Sabaash Naidu", and T. K. Rajeev Kumar was handed directorial duties. Co-produced by Raaj Kamal Films International and Lyca Productions, the film was launched in three languages, with the title "Sabaash Naidu" used for the Tamil and Telugu versions, and "Shabhash Kundu" used for the Hindi version. Kamal Haasan's daughter Shruti Haasan was selected for a key acting role, while his younger daughter Akshara Haasan joined the team as an assistant director. Ramya Krishnan, Brahmanandam and Saurabh Shukla were selected for other acting roles in the production. The team commenced the shoot in Los Angeles, California during June 2016.
The shoot of the film was initially put on hold in June 2016 after the original director T. K. Rajeev Kumar was diagnosed with Lyme disease, prompting Kamal Haasan to takeover as the director. Two days after Rajeev Kumar's exit, the film's editor James Joseph also withdrew from the project after his wife had met with an accident. After the completion of the film's schedule in the US, Kamal Haasan chose to replace the original cinematographer Jaya Krishna Gummadi after being unimpressed with his work. In July 2016, Kamal Haasan fractured his leg after falling at his home in Chennai, with the incident leading to an indefinite delay of the project.
During the period of the production delay, in November 2016, Kamal Haasan split with his long time partner Gautami, who had also worked in the project as a costume designer. Delays meant that the actors in the project had committed to other films and it became difficult to coordinate all the cast members to partake in the shoot at short notice. In January 2017, plans to begin the film again were delayed following the death of Githamani, the wife of co-producer Chandrahasan. Two months after the death of his wife, Chandrahasan also died of a heart attack while visiting London. The film was further delayed as a result of Kamal Haasan's entry into politics, with the actor stating his final film would be "Indian 2" (2020) for Lyca Productions.

RNF43

Ring finger protein 43 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RNF43 gene.
Function.
The protein encoded by this gene is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase and is predicted to contain a transmembrane domain, a protease-associated domain, an ectodomain, and a cytoplasmic RING domain. This protein is thought to negatively regulate Wnt signaling, and expression of this gene results in an increase in ubiquitination of frizzled receptors, an alteration in their subcellular distribution, resulting in reduced surface levels of these receptors. Mutations in this gene have been reported in multiple tumor cells, including colorectal and endometrial cancers. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2015].
