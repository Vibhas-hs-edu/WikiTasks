Dessie Smith Prescott

Dessie Smith Prescott (August 4, 1906April 19, 2002) was Florida’s first professional woman guide and the first female licensed pilot in the state. She was inducted into the Florida Women's Hall of Fame in 1999 for her work.
Biography.
Prescott was born on August 4, 1906, in Island Grove, Florida. Her parents died in the 1918 flu pandemic, and she went to live with an aunt, and later with her brother (in Baltimore). Prescott earned money by working many jobs, including working as a waitress and car seller. With extra money she earned, she would travel back to Florida and hunt game for a month every year. Prescott soon moved back to Florida, helping to sell houses.
Prescott later moved to Philadelphia, where she lived with her brother and learned how to fly on retired planes. After a while, she was issued a pilot's license, becoming the third woman in the United States to be issued such a license. Prescott flew in a barnstorming troop, before quitting. In World War II, she was a member of the Women's Army Corps and later began flying. After attending an Officer Training School in Des Moines, Iowa, Prescott was assigned to the Central Flying Training Command, and spent her time in Texas. After the war was over, she moved back to Florida, where she would reside until her death. She was a close friend of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings.

Mango float

Mango float or crema de mangga is a Filipino icebox cake dessert made with layers of ladyfingers ("broas") or graham crackers, whipped cream, condensed milk, and ripe carabao mangoes. It is chilled for a few hours before serving, though it can also be frozen to give it an ice cream-like consistency. It is a modern variant of the traditional Filipino "crema de fruta" cake. It is also known by various other names like mango refrigerator cake, mango graham float, mango royale, and mango icebox cake, among others. "Crema de mangga" is another version that additionally uses custard and "gulaman" (agar) or gelatin, as in the original "crema de fruta".
Mango float can also be made with various other fruits like strawberries, pineapple, bananas, and cherries, among others. Combinations of different fruits result in a version closer to the original "crema de fruta".

America's Got Talent (season 13)

The thirteenth season of American talent show competition series "America's Got Talent" was broadcast on NBC from May 29 to September 19, 2018. The season saw no major changes to the program, with the guest judges for this season's Judge Cuts stage including Ken Jeong, Olivia Munn, Martina McBride, and Chris Hardwick.
The thirteenth season was won by close-up magician Shin Lim, with acrobatic group Zurcaroh finishing second, and electric violinist Brian King Joseph placing third. During its broadcast, the season averaged around 11.15 million viewers.
Season overview.
Open auditions were held in late 2017, within Orlando, Cincinnati, Savannah, Milwaukee, Houston, Las Vegas, New York City, Nashville, and Los Angeles, with producers also accepting online auditions. As with the previous year, the judges' auditions were held and filmed in March at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in Los Angeles. The Judge Cuts stage of the competition saw the involvement of actor and comedian Ken Jeong, actress Olivia Munn, singer Martina McBride, and comedian Chris Hardwick. There were no major changes made to the program in any aspects, but Simon Cowell was given allowances to halt the performances of two participants - both singers - during the Judge Cuts and asking them to do a different song, after he disliked each singer's original choice.
Of the participants who auditioned for this season, 36 secured a place in the live quarter-finals, with twelve quarter-finalists in each one - amongst these included: acrobatic Zurcaroh, singer Michael Ketterer, singer Courtney Hadwin, singer Amanda Mena, singer Makayla Phillips, who had each received a golden buzzer from the main judges and host; choir Voices of Hope, choir Angel City Chorale, ballroom dancers Quin and Misha, rapper Flau’jae, who had each received a golden buzzer from the guest judges; and opera singer Daniel Emmet, novelty water-spitting act Human Fountains, multimedia performance group Front Pictures, who were chosen as WildCard quarter-finalists. Around 22 quarter-finalists advanced to and split between the two semi-finals - including Front Pictures, chosen again by the judges, this time as their WildCard semi-finalist - with 10 semi-finalists securing a place in the finals. The following below lists the results of each participant's overall performance in this season:

Theodore T. Ellis

Theodore Thaddeus Ellis (April 25, 1867 – January 6, 1934) was an American inventor and publisher.
He was born in St. Louis to John and Mary Bentley Ellis. He began working in the newspaper industry in his teens as a press room apprentice, becoming a pressman in 1886. The next year he enlisted in the Navy, where he stayed for three years, spending most of that time in the Far East. When he returned to the US he worked for the Brockton Enterprise in Massachusetts and the Boston Herald, and in 1900 became press room foreman for The Worcester Telegram.
In 1905 he began working on inventions to improve printing press operations. The publisher of the Telegram, Austin P. Cristy, insisted that he either resign or stop dividing his time between his work and his inventing. Ellis resigned, and made enough money from his inventions to purchase the Worcester Telegram from Cristy in 1919 for $1,000,000.
His inventions included several press blankets, which he founded the New England Fibre Blanket Company to manufacture; they were distributed through the New England Newspaper Supply Company, which he ran. He also became a textile manufacturer, and founded the New England Woolen Fabric Company. He was chairman of the Royal Worcester Corset Company. At one time he served as the president of the New England Daily Newspaper Association.
In about 1912 he married Mary Griffin in Spencer, Massachusetts; they had no children.
In 1920 he acquired The Worcester Evening Gazette from George F. Booth, and combined the two papers into Worcester Telegram-Gazette, selling the combined paper, along with The Sunday Telegram, in 1925 to a group including Booth, for about $2,000,000.
He remained an honorary member of the International Printing Pressmen's Union, despite becoming a publisher, and gave $100,000 in 1928 to the union's widows and orphans fund.
In August 1931, Ellis and Frank Knox jointly bought control of the Chicago Daily News. Knox became the publisher, and Ellis was Vice President.
Ellis was an art collector; his collection included the Northbrook Madonna, at that time thought to be by Raphael, painted in about 1505. He bought it from the Earl of Northbrook in 1928. He was a director of the Worcester Art Museum.
In 1928 he bought Knollwood, a large estate near Worcester, now in the National Register of Historic Places.
Ellis kept a herd of prize cattle, and in 1931 one of his Guernsey cows, "Green Meadow Lustre", broke the record for the most milk and butterfat produced in a single year by a cow between three-and-a-half and four years of age.
Ellis died of a heart attack on January 6, 1934, while in London.

2018 Tathra bushfire

The 2018 Tathra bushfire was a bushfire that burned between 18 and 19 March 2018 and primarily affected parts of the South Coast region in the Australian state of New South Wales. The fire, understood to have been caused by a failure in electrical infrastructure, began in the locality of Reedy Swamp, near Tarraganda, which spread east towards in the municipality of the Bega Valley Shire.
The fire burned through over 1,250 hectares (3,100 acres) of farmland and forest reserves, before impacting the village of Tathra. The fire burned into the town and resulted in an urban conflagration that destroyed over 100 structures.
Background.
Between July 2017 and February 2018 over 11,000 uncontrolled bushfires burnt across New South Wales; with major fires in the Sydney, Shoalhaven/Jervis Bay, Hunter, Mid Coast, Port Stephens, the Pilliga, Southern Tablelands, Mid Western and Tamworth/New England areas. December 2017 was the fifth-warmest December on record. In February 2018 the Minister for Emergency Services, Troy Grant, urged the public to help fire agencies by ensuring they remain prepared for fires. The day of the fire, 18 March 2018, was an extremely hot and windy day, with conditions reaching over and winds gusting to over at the time the fire started.
Timeline.
March 18, 2018
March 19, 2018
Response.
The NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, Member for Bega, Andrew Constance, Member for Eden-Monaro, Mike Kelly and Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, visited Tathra soon after the fire and met with evacuated people at the Bega Showgrounds.
On 26 March 2018 Berejiklian and Constance announced that up to $10 million was available to remove asbestos-contaminated material and to help residents to clean up their properties; with the clean-up operation coordinated by NSW Public Works in conjunction with insurers and the Bega Valley Shire Council. On 29 March Prime Minister Turnbull officially declared the Tathra and Reedy Swamp areas a disaster zone for the purposes of affected residents accessing Australian disaster relief funds. The NSW Government appointed Euan Ferguson as the official Recovery Coordinator and announced that impacted residents could access disaster relief grants to eligible individuals and families whose homes and essential household contents have been damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster; small business were provided access to free independent and confidential business advice; NSW Family and Community Services provided a range of temporary housing support options; and a range of other support services were provided. The Bega Valley Shire Council established a Mayoral Appeal Fund, under the chairmanship of Councillor Kristy McBain, the Mayor; over $1,500,000 has been raised to date.
Investigations.
Immediately following the fire, numerous criticisms were raised by Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters through the Fire Brigade Employees Union in relation to the handling of the fire. Of immediate concern was the fact that their assistance had been declined in the early stages of the fire, which they believe cost more houses which could have been saved. Further culminating the issue were claims by RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers that it would have been "dangerous" for Fire and Rescue NSW firefighters to attend the fire, a claim which was later refuted. Following the allegations, further information was released detailing numerous incidents across the entire state where the Rural Fire Service had denied help from Fire and Rescue NSW at fires and other emergencies. As a result of this, the NSW Government instituted a commission of inquiry, headed by Mick Keelty , a former Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police. The focus of the inquiry was on the call taking and dispatch arrangements of both Fire and Rescue NSW and the NSW Rural Fire Service.
Both the Fire Brigade Employees Union and former Commissioner Keelty emphasised prior to and following the report, that it would not be a criticism of the action of volunteers, but rather an investigation into the overall co-ordination of emergency incidents in NSW. The inquiry identified numerous issues with the response to, and management of the fire. These included: the fact "some policies were not followed on the day"; a deputy incident controller was not appointed; there were delays in feeding information back to the FRNSW ComCen who were on the line to numerous 000 callers seeking assistance; the 'Fires Near Me' app was not regularly updated; an emergency alert was issued too late; ABC radio continued normal broadcasts on the day of the fires rather than broadcasting emergency updates; there were discrepancies in the number of resources attached to the fire between agencies; the RFS were limited to communications by radio with no real time vehicle locators; and that the 000 call taking system was "cumbersome" among other issues.
The key issue of the declined FRNSW assistance was addressed by Keelty in the report. Keelty stated that "It is likely that assistance from FRNSW was initially declined without full situational awareness of the intensity and speed of the fire" and that "FRNSW ComCen overruled the decision of the RFS District Duty Officer and deployed to the Bega Valley fires without being called out, but as it happened this was very useful for the overall protection of homes". Keelty made a number of recommendations, including the abolition of fire district boundaries between the two agencies, the establishment of a centralised 000 call taking system, the roll-out of automatic vehicle locators across the RFS fleet, a review of the effectiveness of emergency public information arrangements and that both services take steps to continue to building a strong mutual respect based relationship with one another, particularly in management areas.
Under the "Coroner's Act 2009", the New South Wales Coroner instituted a coronial inquiry to establish the cause and origin of the bushfire, which as of March 2019 is yet to be released.

Wolfstein Castle

Wolfstein Castle or Schloss Wolfstein is a "schloss" and former castle in Freyung in Lower Bavaria. It gave its name to the county of Wolfstein which was dissolved in 1972.
Location.
The "schloss" lies northwest of the town centre of Freyung on a rocky crag surrounded on three sides by the Saußbach river.
History.
Wolfstein Castle was built as a fortification by the Bishop of Passau, Wolfger von Erla, around 1200. Before that, the surrounding land had been ceded to the bishops of Passau by Emperor Henry VI in 1193. In 1301, a place is first mentioned in a document as "Purchstol zu Wolferstein und ein Wald dazu", later Freyung. The castle itself served as a fortification, administrative base and episcopal hunting lodge. When the Prince-Bishopric of Passau was dissolved in 1803, Wolfstein was initially annexed by Austria. Three years later, the area went to the Kingdom of Bavaria after the Treaty of Pressburg. In 1806, the Bavarian "Landgerichtsbezirk" of Wolfstein was established with its headquarters at Schloss Wolfstein in the municipality ("Landgemeinde") of Ort. It belonged to the Lower Danube Circle (which became Lower Bavaria in 1838). In 1862, the new "Landgerichtsbezirk" of Waldkirchen was established from municipalities of the "Landgerichtsbezirke" of Wolfstein and Wegscheid and the former "Landgericht" of Wolfstein was renamed to the "Landgericht" of Freyung. Both "Landgerichtsbezirke" belonged to the "Bezirksamt" of Wolfstein. In 1938, the "Bezirke" were renamed "Landkreise". Since the incorporation of the municipality of Ort on 1 April 1954, Wolfstein Castle has stood on the territory of the town of Freyung. In 1972 the county of Wolfstein was dissolved.
Present day.
The "schloss" ensemble includes a mighty tower house, built between 1199 and 1204 and 1590, two low wings with arcades, dating to the late 16th and early 17th century, and the castle wall with closed quadrangular courtyard. Since 1982 it has housed the county art collection, "Galerie Wolfstein", with its collection of contemporary art from Eastern Bavaria; since 1989 it has also been home to the Hunting and Fishing Museum ("Jagd- und Fischereimuseum") of the county. This was redesigned and reopened in 2014 under the name "Jagd Land Fluss" ("Hunt Country River"). Directly in front of the castle is are the council offices for Freyung-Grafenau.

Biography.
Dabry gained his first officer-rank when he joined the Aéropostale in 1928 as navigator. Two years later on 12 April 1930 with Jean Mermoz as pilot and Léopold Gimié as radio-operator they made a closed circuit length record by floatplane. The aircraft, a Latécoère 28 fitted with a 600 hp Hispano-Suiza engine flew 4 345 km for 30h25.
On 12 and 13 May 1930 the same crew performed the first crossing of the South Atlantic Ocean with the floatplane Laté 28 "Compte de la Vault" fitted with an Hispano-Suiza engine (600 hp). They flew between Saint Louis, Sénégal to Natal (Brazil). They delivered 130 kg of mail during this 3200 km journey. During the flight two records would be established namely, distance in a straight line for a seaplane and mail delivery time as they flew for 20 hours and 15 minutes.
He became a captain at Air France in 1936. During his career he made more than 540 crossings of the North Atlantic Ocean. He became one of the executive directors of the company. He had logged 16,000 hours of flight time when he left Air France in 1957.

Soviet Baltic Sea campaign in 1945

The Soviet naval Baltic Sea campaign in 1945 was launched by the Soviet Navy to harass enemy shipping and naval military assets of Nazi Germany on the Eastern Front during World War II. Both submarines and surface units of the Soviet Navy were employed. The campaign scored successes during Operation Hannibal.
Background.
When Finland joined sides with the Allies in September 1944, the Soviet Navy could successfully avoid the German mine barrages at the entry of Gulf of Finland and quickly resumed submarine operations during the second part of the year. At the beginning of 1945 the Soviet Navy dispatched once again submarines alongside motor torpedo boats for coastal attacks but avoided the use destroyers and major warship.
Twenty Soviet submarines were engaged into the offensive, performing more patrols compared to 1944 and displaying an increased aggressive behavior: cooperations with reconnaissance aircraft was sometimes performed.
Submarine Engagements.
On the night between 6 and 7 January, Soviet submarine S-4 was lost, likely rammed and sunk by German torpedo boat T-3 in Danzig Bay. It would be the only Soviet submarine loss of this campaign.
On 12 January, Soviet submarine K-51 shelled and sunk the neutral Swedish fishing boat "Ib" (15 tons).
On 16 January, Soviet submarine ShCh-307 torpedoed and sunk "Henrietta Schulze" (1923 GRT) south-west of Libau.
On 28 January, Soviet submarine K-51 torpedoed and sunk Danish merchant "Viborg" (2028 GRT) south of Bornholm.
On 30 January, Soviet submarine S-13 under command of captain Alexander Marinesko torpedoed and sunk the large German liner Wilhelm Gustloff (25484 GRT) employed as transport ship for Operation Hannibal. The ship went down with up 9400 human losses, including both civilians and military personnel.
On 4 February, Soviet submarine ShCh-318 torpedoed and sunk German tanker "Hiddensee" (643 GRT) south-west of Libau.
On 10 February, Soviet submarine S-13 under command of captain Alexander Marinesko accomplished another significant success, torpedoing and sinking the large German liner General von Steuben (14660 GRT), like Gustloff also employed as transport ship for Operation Hannibal. The ship went down with up 3600 human losses, mostly wounded military personnel.
On 23 February, Soviet submarine ShCh-309 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Gottingen" (6267 GRT) south-west of Libau.
On 17 March, Soviet submarine K-53 torpedoed and sunk German merchant "Margarethe Cords" (1912 GRT) off the Stolpebank.
On 23 March, Soviet submarine L-21 torpedoed and sunk the German patrol vessel V-2022 "E.Colzmann" off Kolberg.
On 24 March, Soviet submarine L-21 torpedoed and sunk the German tug "Erni" (105 GRT) off Kolberg.
On 10 April, Soviet submarine ShCh-310 torpedoed and sunk the German merchant Ilmenau (1201 GRT) west of Liepāja.
On 11 April, Soviet submarine K-56 shelled and sunk the neutral Swedish fishing vessel "Ramona" (57 GRT) south of Utklippan.
On 17 April, Soviet submarine L-3 torpedoed and sunk the German troop transport Goya (5230 GRT) employed for Operation Hannibal. The ship went down with up 7000 human losses, including both military personnel and refugees.
Motor torpedo boats engagements.
On 18 February, German merchant "Tolina"(1923 GRT) was sunk either by Soviet motor torpedo boat TK-158 or aircraft.
On 18 March, during a clash between Soviet motor torpedo boats and German S-boots, the Soviet unit TK-66 was lost.
On 27 March, a subsequent clash between Soviet motor torpedo boats (D-3 class) and German S-boots caused the further loss of Soviet units TK-166 and TK-196 and other units damaged.
On the night of 15/16 April, German destroyer Z-34 was attacked and torpedoed by Soviet motor torpedo boats in the bay of Danzig: the attack was performed by TK-131 and TK-141.
The ship received temporary repairs and with the surrender of Germany was transferred to the United States Navy that deemed the ship unworth of further repair and scuttled her. 
On 25 April, German merchant "Emili Sauber" (2475 GTR) was torpedoed and sunk by Soviet motor torpedo boat TK-133.
On 26 April, German landing craft F-248 was torpedoed by Soviet motor torpedo boats TK-131 and TK-135 or sunk by aircraft.
On 6 May, German landing craft PiLB-43/I was torpedoed and sunk by Soviet motor torpedo boat.
Minelaying operations.
All the three Soviet minelaying submarines left to the Baltic Sea Fleet were employed for their intended purpose like the previous campaign.
On 26 January, Soviet submarine L-3 laid a first field off Ventspils: the only success scored was the sinking of German merchant "Henry Lutgens" (1141 GRT) on 29 January. 
A second field was laid on 2 February off Libau: the only success scored was the German icebreaker Pollux (4191 GRT) heavily damaged and beached on 2 February. 
A third field was laid on 23 March, scoring the following hits:
Between 8 and 13 March, Soviet submarine L-21 laid mines off Hela peninsula. The field scored victories over German warships: 
On 30 March, Soviet submarine Lembit laid a field of mines off Wladyslawowo: the only known loss of this field occurred on 25 April with the sinking of German patrol vessel Vs-343
Outcome.
Fuel shortage restricted the number of German escort available for protecting ships and convoy and explain the Soviet success and the loss of a single Soviet submarine in action: while the campaign is not evaluated as a decisive victory (13 transports sunk, for 63000 GRT), submarine obtained some notable sinking. The sinking of Wilhelm Gustloff, General von Steuben and Goya was a demonstration of the deadly potential of submarine warfare.
It is important to stress how despite being often erroneously described as noncombatant units, the ships actually possessed defensive anti-aircraft weapons and also carried military personnel (in addition to refugees).

The Theban Tomb TT97 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, part of the Theban Necropolis, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite to Luxor. The tomb belongs to an ancient Egyptian named Amenemhat, who was the High Priest of Amun at Karnak, during the reign of pharaoh Amenhotep II of the 18th Dynasty. Amenemhat was the son of the "wab"-priest and "Overseer of the sandal makers of Amun", Djehutyhotep. 
The tomb consists of a hall, a passage and an inner room. The hall is decorated with scenes depicting an inspection and offerings. The hall shows scenes of a funeral procession and a priest and lector before the mummy of the deceased. The ceiling is inscribed with offering texts. The inner room contains a stele with an autobiographical text, scenes of purification, offerings, and a pillar contains traces of a hymn.
In a burial chamber the coffin of a royal sandal maker of Amun, named Thu was found. The coffin is thought to date to the 18th Dynasty.
Amenemhat is attested by several funerary cones now exhibited at the University College, London (UC 37551) and in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York.

Train graveyard

A train graveyard (or cemetery) is where trains and rolling stock are discarded while awaiting collection, recycling, or destruction. They might be abandoned and left to decay. The term can also be used to include trams. Such vehicle graveyards are distinguished from an abandoned railway, which is a railway line that is no longer used for that purpose, and abandoned railway stations which are similarly disused. Some train graveyards attract visitors and can be a source of tourism, while others have had a role in preserving the history of the railways.
Locations.
Some sites contain numerous trains that have been abandoned. In the United States, just outside Watervliet, New York, there is the main line for the Delaware and Hudson Railway. Alongside this railway line is a disused stretch of track which is home to rusted locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. In North Carolina, a graveyard features trains and trams from across the United States, including a passenger train from Philadelphia and abandoned subway cars. Istvántelki Főműhely, formerly one of the most important railway repair workshops in Hungary, now lays disused with old rolling stock on site. Many of them were taken there to be repaired before being exhibited in the Hungarian Railway History Park in Budapest but never made it. One particularly sizable site is the Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Wales, from which 213 of 297 locomotives were rescued by the nascent railway preservation movement. In Russia, there is one in Shumkovo. In Tangshan in north China there are rusting locomotives on the sidings of now shut-down coal mines. A few have also been moved and exhibited in a Coal Mining Park and Railway museum.
Trains can be abandoned in a location because it is deemed too difficult to move them. Two large steam locomotives of the Eagle Lake and West Branch Railroad, for example, were left in a woodland area in the U.S. state of Maine after the end of a local logging operation because it was not practical to move them from such a remote location.
Train graveyards can be of interest to railfans, urban explorers, and other tourists. The "Cementerio de Trenes" ("train cemetery") near Uyuni, Bolivia, serves as a tourist attraction with trains dating back to the 19th century left to rust in the extensive salt flats of the Salar de Uyuni. The site contains a train alleged to have been robbed by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and has been called "one of the most striking and haunting sights in the deserts of southwest Bolivia".

2018–19 La Liga

The 2018–19 La Liga season, also known as LaLiga Santander for sponsorship reasons, was the 88th since its establishment. The season began on 17 August 2018 and finished on 19 May 2019. Fixtures for the 2018–19 season were announced on 24 July 2018. This was the first La Liga season to use VAR.
Barcelona were the defending champions, and they secured a second consecutive title with three games to spare following victory over Levante on 27 April. Huesca, Rayo Vallecano and Valladolid joined as the promoted clubs from the 2017–18 Segunda División. They replaced Málaga, Las Palmas and Deportivo La Coruña, who were relegated to the 2018–19 Segunda División.
Summary.
Several clubs made managerial changes before the start of the season. Among them were Real Madrid, when Zinedine Zidane resigned following the club's third consecutive UEFA Champions League victory. He was replaced by Julen Lopetegui, who was managing the Spanish national team at the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia at the time of announcement and was dismissed from that job as a result. Other incomers included Pablo Machín at Sevilla, who was hired after his success with newly promoted Girona the previous season.
In the transfer window, the biggest deal saw Real Madrid lose Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a fee of €112 million; the Portuguese forward had scored 450 goals in 438 games during his nine years in the Spanish capital. Real Madrid's additions included Belgium international goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois for €35 million from Chelsea, and striker Mariano returned to the club from Lyon for €22 million. Defending champions Barcelona added Clément Lenglet to their defence, Arturo Vidal to midfield, and spent over €40 million on Brazilian forward Malcom. Players exiting Barcelona included Andrés Iniesta at the end of a successful 16-year-spell, as he signed for Vissel Kobe in Japan.
Veterans Gabi and Fernando Torres also left Atlético Madrid for new teams in Asia, while the same club welcomed in the likes of World Cup-winning French midfielder Thomas Lemar and Portugal's Gelson Martins. After a successful previous season, in which the team finished fourth and returned to the Champions League, Valencia made permanent the loan signing of Portuguese winger Gonçalo Guedes from Paris Saint-Germain and Geoffrey Kondogbia from Inter Milan. Forward Simone Zaza and midfielder João Cancelo both left to Italy, while Kevin Gameiro arrived as replacement. Athletic Bilbao sold Kepa Arrizabalaga to Chelsea for €80 million, a world record fee for a goalkeeper.
The tenth round of matches featured the first "El Clásico" of the season, which Barcelona won 5–1 at home against Real Madrid with a hat-trick by Luis Suárez. The result put Madrid into 9th place, and led to the dismissal of Lopetegui after only five months. Other early pace-setters included Sevilla with their prolific strike partnership of André Silva and Wissam Ben Yedder, Alavés who were briefly league leaders in mid-October, Espanyol, and Valladolid who had been taken over by former Brazil international Ronaldo.
Teams.
Promotion and relegation (pre-season).
A total of 20 teams will contest the league, including 17 sides from the 2017–18 season and three promoted from the 2017–18 Segunda División. This will include the two top teams from the Segunda División, and the winners of the play-offs.
The first team to be relegated from La Liga were Málaga. Their relegation was ensured on 19 April 2018, following a late 0−1 defeat to Levante, ending their 10-year spell in the top division.
The second team to be relegated were Las Palmas, after a 0−4 home defeat to Deportivo Alavés on 22 April 2018, ending their three-year spell in the league.
The last team to be relegated were Deportivo La Coruña, following a 2−4 home loss to Barcelona on 29 April 2018. This result ensured Deportivo's third relegation in seven years, and also handed Barcelona their 25th La Liga title.
On 21 May 2018, Huesca were promoted to La Liga for the first time ever by winning 2–0 at Lugo.
Rayo Vallecano was the second team to earn promotion to La Liga on 27 May 2018 by winning against Lugo as well, this time 1–0. Rayo returned after a two-year absence.
Valladolid was the last team to be promoted after beating Sporting Gijón and Numancia in the play-offs. Valladolid returned to top division after 4 years.
This was the first season since the 2014–15 season without any teams from the archipelagos of Spain (teams located on the Balearic Islands and Canary Islands) since Las Palmas was relegated and Tenerife failed to qualify for the promotion play-offs.
Stadia and locations.
 
Celta signed a sponsorship contract with Abanca to rename their stadium as Abanca-Balaídos.
Matches outside Spain.
On 16 August 2018, La Liga signed a 15-year agreement with Relevant Sports (owners of the International Champions Cup) to schedule one match per season within the United States. This would mark the first time ever that an official La Liga league match would be held there. The match between Girona and Barcelona, to be played on 27 January 2019, was selected to be played in Miami, but it required the approval of the Royal Spanish Football Federation. On 21 September 2018, the Spanish Football Federation denied approval of the match being held in Miami. On 26 October 2018, following a request for guidance from the Spanish Football Federation, US Soccer and CONCACAF, the FIFA Council discussed La Liga's proposal. At the end of the meeting, the FIFA Council stated that "Consistent with the opinion expressed by the Football Stakeholders Committee, the Council emphasised the sporting principle that official league matches must be played within the territory of the respective member association". On 13 December 2018, Barcelona left their disposition to play the match in Miami without effect.

Petr Jarchovský

Petr Jarchovský (born 6 October 1966 in Prague) is a Czech screenwriter, whose writing credits include "Big Beat" (1993), "Cosy Dens" (1999), and "Divided We Fall" (2000). Jarchovský is a frequent and long-term collaborator with director Jan Hřebejk.
Career.
Jarchovský attended high school in Prague and then, from 1987 to 1991, at the Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague, alongside his high school classmate and future creative collaborator Jan Hřebejk. His screenwriting debut was a collaboration with another classmate, Igor Chaun, on a project entitled "Very Believable Stories". Around this time, Jarchovský and Hřebejk also co-wrote a film based on Hřebejk's experiences of socialist summer camps, entitled "Let's All Sing A Song", which was later made into a feature film by Ondřej Trojan in his directorial debut.
Jarchovský and Hřebejk's breakthrough came in 1993 with the film "Big Beat", a rock and roll comedy set in the 1950s, written by Jarchovský and Hřebejk from a story by Petr Šabach. The film won the Czech Lion award for Best Film in 1993. In 1997 Jarchovský and Hřebejk received awards from the Film and Television Association and the Literary Fund for three episodes they had written for the TV series "Bachelors", which were awarded for their contribution to dramatic television programming.
The writing and production team behind "Big Beat" subsequently reunited for two further films, "Cosy Dens" (; 1999) and "Divided We Fall" (; 2000), both of which became enormously successful within the Czech Republic. Jarchovský also wrote the screenplay for "Želary" (2003), directed by Ondrej Trojan, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004.
Jarchovský also teaches at the Faculty of Screenwriting and Script Editing at FAMU, and works as a script editor for Czech Television.

Athletico Mince

Athletico Mince is a British comedy podcast hosted by Bob Mortimer and Andy Dawson. The series began life as a humorous take on the world of football, including discussions such as whether being gentle in the Premier League makes one a better manager. As the podcast evolved however, the focus of the segments has switched more towards the bizarre, and often true, experiences and encounters of the hosts. Despite the move away from football, there are still a number of features that include personalities within the world of sport such as Steve McClaren, Mark Lawrenson and Peter Beardsley. Other features include Bob’s trips to South Africa, Dom Littlewood and Andy's interactions with Jeremy Corbyn.
The podcast was first released on 8 March 2016. In late 2016 a live version of the show was created and has since been toured around the UK, with a video available online. As of March 2018, the podcast had over 30 million listeners, with over 200,000 per episode.
Since April 2019, the podcast has used Patreon as a platform to introduce the 'Club Parsnips' membership. This allows the audience to pay for the content, if they wish. The benefits include bonus episodes, access to episodes earlier and no advertisements during episodes.
Sections and characters.
The podcasts include a number of real and fictional characters, voiced by both hosts, in semi-regular sections.
Other, less frequent, characters include Dara Ó Briain, Piers Morgan, Gregg Wallace, Alan Brazil, Ian Holloway, Chris Evans, Billy Bragg, Jim White, Joe Swash and Jordan Henderson.
In most cases, each section is self contained. However, on some occasions there have been crossovers within the stories, for example, the Alderman appearing at a Jeremy Corbyn rally and Peter Beardsley featuring in episodes of "Gangs of the EPL".
Themes.
As the show has progressed the focus and themes within the podcasts have evolved. While football began as the sole focus of the show, numerous other areas have become important areas of discussion.
Prior to the start of "Athletico Mince", Bob underwent heart surgery that saved his life. A running joke in many of the episodes involves Bob questioning Andy as to why he hasn't bothered to ask about his health.
With Andy living in Sunderland, and Bob having moved to the more affluent south of England from Middlesbrough, a lot of the humour is based on the social standing of the hosts with Dawson portrayed as a lower class, run-down character and Mortimer as a pompous millionaire who has servants and/or slaves.
Other media.
In April 2017 Dawson released "The World of Football According to Athletico Mince".
Animated versions of the songs, themes and stories have been made available online and used during the live shows. Fan-made instrumental versions of the songs have been used in later episodes.
Certain performances of the 2020 live tour were postponed due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
The episode artwork for the first 50 episodes was illustrated by artist and designer Ben Brignell.
The Chief animator for the podcast is graphic designer @benpics. His cartoon work and animation blends caricature and observation to add another dimension to the podcast.
Reception.
The podcast has received a largely positive response from both critics and fans with many enjoying its use of football as a theme, without listeners having to be avid followers of the sport. There has also been praise for Mortimer due to his performances without his comedy partner Vic Reeves, yet still in keeping with his surreal style.
In an interview with Mortimer, Joe Zadeh from Vice quipped that the podcast "from episode one...derailed immediately from its intended topic of football, and has since become a bizarre and engrossing world of idle chat, improvised tales and sketches that often prolapse mid-joke"
Bruce Dessau from "The London Evening Standard" stated "This is distinctly daft comedy, full of in-jokes, catchphrases and occasional songs. It evokes Viz comic as much as comic Vic Reeves, yet "Athletico Mince" is very much a winner in its own right."
In "The Guardian’s" countdown of the 50 best podcasts of 2016, Gwilym Mumford named his favourite episode as "Steve’s Restaurant Showdown, which features a surreal Scottish folk tale from Mortimer that rivals anything he’s managed as part of Reeves and Mortimer."

TT95

The Theban Tomb TT95 is located in Sheikh Abd el-Qurna, part of the Theban Necropolis, on the west bank of the Nile, opposite to Luxor. The tomb belongs to an ancient Egyptian named Mery, who was a High Priest of Amun at Karnak, during the reign of pharaoh Amenhotep II of the 18th Dynasty. Mery was the son of the First Prophet of Min of Koptos (Qift) named Nebpehtire and the Lady Hunayt. Mery's wife was named Dey.
Mery also partially usurped the tomb of the royal herald Iamunedjeh TT84 for himself and his mother.
Tomb.
The tomb consists of a pillared hall and a subterranean complex including five burial chambers. The scenes in the hall show offerings made to Mery and his mother. Guests, musicians and dancers are depicted as well. Mery is shown inspecting cattle, the weighing of gold, chariot making and metal working in another scenes. The pillars are decorated with scenes showing Mery and his wife Dey "going forth to see Amun", the text of a New Year Festival, Mery and his mother consecrating offerings for Amun-Re Harakhti and Amenhotep II.
One burial chamber is located at the end of a long passage (chamber 1) and the burials in chamber 1 date to the 18th Dynasty. The other four chambers form a complex and are entered from a location outside the burial chapel. The burials in the four chambers date between the 18th and 22nd Dynasty.
An additional shaft with a burial chamber was added to the tomb during a later period (21st and 22nd Dynasty).
Human remains.
Grave robberies have damaged the burials to an extent that it is not clear exactly how many individuals were laid to rest in the tomb. Chamber 1 contained the burial of four individuals: two males and two females. The four connected chambers and associated passageway contained 29 individuals. Of these burials eight were male, nine were female and for the rest the gender could not be determined. Further burials were found in the hall and the total number of individuals is said to be 73.

Walt Disney's Treasury of Classic Tales (hardcover book collection)

Walt Disney's "Treasury of Classic Tales" is a series of hardcover books that collects the Sunday comic strips of Walt Disney's "Treasury of Classic Tales", an umbrella title for comic strips which were drawn by several different Disney artists during the period of the early 1950s to the mid-1980s. The "Treasury of Classic Tales" comic strips were used by Walt Disney Studios to introduce current movie characters into comic adaptations for the public. The books are being published by IDW Publishing's imprint, "The Library of American Comics". The first book of the series was released in November of 2016.
In April 2018, it was announced that, due to the sales goal of the series not being met, the third volume may be the last one to be published. 
Format.
The hardcover books have a sewn binding, a sewn linen ribbon bookmark, and a dust jacket. They measure 12 × 8.5 inches or 305 × 216 mm.
They are printed in full colour, as were the original comic strip publications. Each volume of the series has approximately 230 pages, some of which contain supplementary materials. Every book has an introduction written by the animation historian Michael Barrier. Background information on each featured comic story is consistently presented before each comic strip. All are prefaced with an introduction which includes comparisons between the movie and comic strip adaptation, trivia about the movie, and Walt Disney's motivation and biographical touchstones.
Volumes in the series are sold separately. The release schedule for the series is one volume per year.

Charles Anthony Vince

Charles Anthony Vince (1855–1929) was an English academic, school head and author. He was a Fellow of Christ's College, Cambridge. and Secretary of the National Liberal Union in 1892.
Life.
He was born on 7 December 1855 at Handsworth, the son of Charles Vince; the classical scholar James Herbert Vince was his brother. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and matriculated at Christ's College, Cambridge in 1874. He graduated B.A. in 1878, and M.A. in 1881.
A Fellow at Christ's from 1880 to 1886, Vince became an assistant master at Repton School in 1878. He was appointed Head Master of Mill Hill School in 1886.
When the Liberal Unionists split from Gladstone's Liberal party, Vince was in charge of Joseph Chamberlain's constituency organisation. He followed Chamberlain into the Liberal Unionist camp, becoming Secretary of the Birmingham Liberal Unionist Association, and leaving Mill Hill, in 1892. He later, in 1903, chaired the Birmingham Tariff Reform Committee, a significant power base for Chamberlain. As an aide to Chamberlain, he has been described as "chief political organiser". Another view, from Byng Kenrick, was of "a literary looking gent", who was "good at slogans and pamphlets but not a great organiser".
Around 1903 Vince was a leader writer for the "Birmingham Post". At this period, leading up to Chamberlain's resignation from the Cabinet, Vince was a close confidant. In 1906 he was considered a candidate to be editor of the "Post", but lost out to George William Hubbard.
Vince died on 27 January 1929, in Birmingham.
Works.
Vince was also a translator into English of Demosthenes.

Early life and education.
Rezakhani was born in Tehran, Iran and was educated in Europe and Iran before moving to the United States. He later moved back to London, UK where he earned his MSc in History from London School of Economics and a PhD in Late Antique/Middle Eastern History from UCLA with a dissertation titled "Empires and Microsystems : Late Antique Regional Economy in Central and West Asia, 500-750" under the supervision of Michael G. Morony and advised by Patrick J. Geary, Claudia Rapp, and Sanjay Subrahmanyam. Because of his multicultural background and education, Rezakhani is fluent in English, Persian and a number of other research and modern languages.
Academic career.
Since earning his PhD, Rezakhani became a research officer at the London School of Economics where he worked on an ERC funded project, Useful and Reliable Knowledge in Global Histories of Material Progress in the East and the West (URKEW). He also taught as a teaching fellow the LSE, SOAS, and AKU, as well as a visiting assistant professor at the University of Nevada, Reno.
From 2014 to 2016, he was an Alexander von Humboldt Stiftung fellow at the Freie Universität, Berlin. Since 2016, he has been an associate research scholar and lecturer at Princeton University.
Rezakhani has also been involved in various projects for the academic study of late antique Iran and Central Asia, as well as Global Late Antiquity. He is the founder and manager of rotating Twitter accounts Tweeting Historians and Historians of Iran, which aim to promote the works of the historians of Iranian and global history by presenting their work in form of weekly tweets concerned with each scholar's research. He is also the founder and author of Iranologie.com, a site dedicated to the history of Iran since 1997.
Scholarship.
Rezakhani is a Global historian who has published on Late Antique Iran and Central Asia, particularly Sasanian history. Educated initially in philology (including Indo-European Studies) and medieval history, Rezakhani's work encompasses comparative approaches to World History, using Central and West Asia as areas of focus and encompassing matters of culture, language, and economic and political history. Chronologically, Rezakhani's research is most concerned with the first millennium, particularly the period of transition from late antiquity to Early Islam.
Rezakhani's interest in Central Asian history has also resulted in works concerned with the historiography of the Silk Road and its creation in 19th century Europe as part of colonial historiography. His denial of the concept of the Silk Road, reflected in his article on the subject, the Road that Never Was and is the basis of a forthcoming volume, "Creating the Silk Road: Travel, Trade and Myth-Making" (I.B. Tauris, forthcoming);. His monograph on the history of Central Asia, called "ReOrienting the Sasanians", provided a political history of Central Asia (including Afghanistan and Transoxiana) from the Indo-Parthian period to the coming of Islam, and included the history of the Kushans, Iranian Huns, the Kidarites, Hephthalites, Nezak Shah, and the Western Turk Empire. In 2018, the book was the recipient of the Honourable Mention in the Ehsan Yarshater Book Award.
Rezakhani's contribution to the critiques of concepts prevalent in both academic history-writing and popular historical imagination about Iran and Asia, including the idea of Iranians as "Aryans", Nowruz as an "Indo-European" tradition, representations of "the Ancients" in contemporary Iranian discourse and other subjects.
He is a regular contributor to Iranian and English media, with contributions to BBC Persian, VOA Persian and Radio Farda, as well as to popular history journals such as History Today. Rezakhani runs the History of Iran podcast and is an editor at the Sasanika Project.

Samara embankment

The Samara embankment ("; Samarskaya naberezhnaya") is a 5 km long pedestrianized street along the left bank of the Volga river in Central Samara, Russia. It spans between Lesnaya Street and Samara river port.
History.
The first stage.
Design work was begun in the 1930s. Wooden houses, storage facilities and stables occupied the Volga bank. In order to begin the construction it was necessary to demolish all buildings, strengthen the bank, extend the riverside, plant trees and shrubs and shape a beach. The Samara embankment was designed by architect Mikhail Trufanov. The project included four stages: the first between Vilonovskaya and Nekrasovskaya Streets, the second between Studenchesky lane and Volzhsky avenue, the third between Nekrasovskaya Street and Samara river terminal and the fourth between Volzhsky avenue and a ravine at the north-west of Samara.
The bank was cleared between Vilonovsky and Nekrasocsky ramp. A beach appeared here in 1939. The building of the 1350-metre-long first stage of the embankment was begun in 1940. In 1941 construction was suspended before 1954 following the outbreak of the Second World war. Retaining wall was erected along the bank. Ural Granite was used for lining of the embankment. New promenade was decorated with the concrete sculptures and young trees. Now a lot of summer cafe with a view to the river operate here.
The second stage.
1400-m long the second stage was erected between 1958 and 1961. Retaining wall was made of reinforced concrete. Granite was used for stairs and curbstones. The second section is a 30–60 meters wide boulevard with 7 meters wide promenade alleys which is decorated with garden sofa. In 2011 the section was reсonstructed. The embankment was cobbled, street lights was replaced and for bicyclists was made bikeways. Monument to the first Samara voivode Grigiry Zasekin was opened in 2014 near Polevoy ramp. 
The third stage.
The third stage is a continuation of the first stage to the river terminal. The calciferous retaining wall was built in the early 20th century. After the construction of the new river port building this section of the bank had made more pleasant. The territory was landscaped and decorated with a fountain by architect M. Trufanov. In 2012 the section was reconstructed similarly to the second section.
The fourth stage.
The river bank in this location has a sharp incline. That is why it was cut into two of successively receding flat surfaces (terraces). The fourth stage of Samara embankment has non-official name "Oktyabrskaya embankment". Ladya monument in the form of a boat which is one of the most prominent symbols of Samara was opened here in 1986. The opening ceremony was held in conjunction by the 400-year anniversary of Samara.

Charles McGarel

Charles McGarel (1788–1876) was an Ireland-born Ulster-Scots merchant and slave owner. In 1833 the British Government abolished slavery and compensated owners, such as McGarel, who became a major beneficiaries of this scheme. With his wealth he conducted business in the City of London, funded civic works in his home town of Larne, County Antrim and bought land and property in Ireland. Having no children, he left his estate to his brother-in-law, James Hogg, on condition that he integrate "McGarel" into his family name, becoming James McGarel-Hogg, later Lord Magheramorne.
Early years.
McGarel (or M'Garel) came from Larne, County Antrim. His parents, innkeepers Hannah and Charles McGarel, had six children, four boys and two girls. As young men the brothers travelled to Demerara in South America, where the economy of the area was based on the use of slave labour to produce coffee, cotton and sugar. In 1808, aged about twenty, McGarel was working as a partner in a mercantile business importing goods from Britain and later property dealing involving sale of slaves. His elder brother, John, had been in Demerara since 1799 and another brother, William, died there in 1810.
Return to Britain.
The McGarel brothers were back in Britain in about 1817. John, perhaps singled out as someone unused to city life, was subjected to a blackmail attempt by a trickster in London. The perpetrator was arrested, tried and sentenced to death for attempting to obtain £20. Charles went into partnership in the City of London with Alexander and David Hall in a business called Hall, McGarel at 7 Austin Friars. They acted as agents/attorneys for plantation owners and provided loans and mortgages. In addition to the sale of plantations, buildings and crops, the partners were involved with the sale of slaves. Alexander Hall left the business and was replaced by David's son Alexander Hall Hall (the double name was a result of a clerical error at his baptism). McGarel invested in various commercial and business activities including railroads and iron/coal workings in Wales. Not all of his investment went well: he was a Mexican Bond holder during a period when the government of that country defaulted on payments, and some of his railway shares gave poor returns.
Slavery abolition - compensation to the slave-owners.
In 1826 Lord Bathurst, Britain's Colonial Secretary of State, attempted to force compulsory manumission on Demerara. The administrative body in Demerara - the Court of Policy - refused to comply and they were supported by the plantation owners who submitted a petition to the Crown. McGarel was one of the five signatories of this document that helped to thwart Bathurst's plan. However, in 1833 the Slavery Abolition Act was passed that stated:
A compensation fund of £20 million was set aside for slave-owners by the British Government, estimated to be the equivalent of 40% of the national budget. £15 million of this was raised in the form of a loan. Slave owners, who believed they were entitled to compensation, made claims that were then checked by a Slave Compensation Commission. The value depended on factors such as gender, age and skill levels of individual slaves. These claims were then validated in the colonies. Some claims were duplicated, making the process even more protracted and could lead to litigation. It took many years for all of the claims to be processed. The three McGarel brothers, Charles, John and Peter, all received compensation with Charles being the largest recipient. Some of these payments were shared with his partners or other claimants.
Hogg family.
In 1856 McGarel, who was 68, married 28 year old Mary Rosina Hogg, daughter of Sir James Weir Hogg, an Irishman, who like McGarel was from County Antrim. One of Mary's fourteen siblings was brother Quinton Hogg. McGarel, who was childless, took an interest in Quinton's career and initially found him a position with sugar merchants Bosanquet, Curtis &amp; Co., where he became a partner. McGarel sent him to Demerara where he helped develop more efficient processes for extracting sugar from the cane. Hogg, who had witnessed the suffering of the poor in London, also provided welfare facilities for the plantation workers. He later returned to England and continued his philanthropic work in education for the poor.
McGarel's brothers and sisters had few children, only his sister Catherine had one surviving daughter, Mary Allen, who married Sir James Murray, discoverer of Milk of Magnesia. McGarel chose to leave his estate to another of his wife's brothers, James Hogg, with the proviso that he include McGarel in his family name.
Larne, Co. Antrim.
McGarel paid for the construction of several buildings and other works in his home town of Larne, Ireland. These included Larne Town Hall, built at a cost of about £5500. It was opened in 1870 for use by all denominations as a news-room, library and town hall. He also funded ten almshouses for the needy (removed 1971), and donated land for a new cemetery in 1862.
McGarel became a land owner and landlord in Antrim when in 1842 he purchased the Magheramorne estate from John Irving, M.P. for Antrim. He was initially an "absentee landlord" but took residence in 1844 at the beginning of a period that came to be known in Ireland as the Great Famine. Blight in the subsistence potato crop throughout the land led to mass starvation, followed by fever and disease. The death toll in Ireland during this period has been estimated at 1 million people. Tenant farmers, who were unable to pay their rents, were often evicted and many emigrated with their families. The Ulster area of Ireland was not so badly affected, but McGarel's tenants still struggled to meet their commitments and in 1849 petitioned him for a 50% rent reduction, which McGarel granted. It was also reported at this time that McGarel had been providing barrels of lime for his tenants to use on their land from his Magheramorne lime quarry. It is not clear if he reduced the rent on a regular basis, but in 1875 he announced another 50% half-year rent reduction for "his loyal and contented tenancy". McGarel took an interest in the work of his tenant farmers and encouraged improvements via innovation and training. He also supported the Larne Agricultural School and the work of Dr Thomas Kirkpatrick, agricultural inspector. This scheme was not without critics because only a small number of the students who graduated went on to take up farming. During the period that followed the 1866 financial crisis, McGarel believed that the high number of unemployed workers in Britain should be encouraged to emigrate to the colonies. He joined the National Emigration League and was prepared to seed fund the scheme with £1000 of his own money if others matched his contribution.
McGarel was High Sheriff of County Antrim in 1848, a Justice of the Peace and appointed Deputy Lieutenant in 1855 In 1846 Charles McGarel with others was appointed one of Her Majesty's Commissioners for borrowing, raising, managing, and expending a five hundred thousand pound loan for British Guiana related to immigration purposes.
Family.
McGarel outlived all of his sibling and died at 6 Regency Square, Brighton, Sussex on 10 October 1876 aged 88; probate indicated value of his effects was under £500,000. His wife Mary died in 1913. In the 1851 census for Co. Antrim, brother John (1779-1852) is shown as living in Main Street, Larne, with his brother, Peter (c1789-1859), and his wife Helena (1801-1882). Peter, who had continued to live in Larne, was active in civic matters in the town. McGarel's sister, Catherine, who was the mother of Lady Mary (Allen) Murray, had died in about 1816 and the remaining sister, Mary (1788-1872) died in Larne unmarried. McGarel's brother-in-law James Hogg, who inherited his estate was made 1st Baron of Magheramorne in 1877.

Soho Roses

Soho Roses were a Glam punk rock band from London. They emerged from the British Glam scene along with Hanoi Rocks, The Dogs D'Amour, The Babysitters and The Quireboys; gaining popularity during the late 1980s with a series of singles and an album before splitting in 1989.
Formation.
Soho Roses evolved from Post-punk Glam band The V2s, formed in 1986 by Andy ‘The Riff’ Socratous, guitarist of punk band The Dark. 
This formation rehearsed until they parted company with Mark ‘Boots’ Thomas and recruited Paul ‘Blittz’ Toombs. Andy ‘The Riff’ left after recording a demo. With the departure of Andy Riff, the band was re-named Soho Roses. The sound developed with Andy J. Davies’ trashy, punky, Rock n roll guitar taking centre stage, underpinned with Joolz's melodic bass playing.
"Whatever Happened To" EP.
After shows on the London circuit, Soho Roses formed a self-financed record company (Trash Can Records of London) and released their debut 12” 4-track EP titled "Whatever happened To". The EP was recorded and mixed in two days with engineer and producer Colin Leggett at Carlton Studios, Bedford, UK in June 1987. Soho Roses' attitude at the time was summed up when budget constraints forced the decision to either remix the EP or release it on pink vinyl. The band chose a shocking pink vinyl release (and later blue vinyl). The record marked their commitment to the sprit of 'Trashy, Glam' with D.I.Y, punk ethics.
The EP bucked the trend for a 'Heavy Rock/ Metal Glam' sound, which was current at time, for a more sleazy rock 'n' roll vibe with an emphasis on catchy tunes. This split the British rock fraternity and brought the Soho Roses both praise and derision. Both of which the band revelled in. Although they were given enthusiastic reviews, journalists struggled to categorise them. In an interview with Chris Welch in "Kerrang!" magazine January 1988 they explain how they did not mind being called 'Glam' but because they did not lean too heavily on ballads they preferred to be called 'Trash'.
"Whatever Happened To" sold out of its initial pressing and was championed by influential British rock magazines "Kerrang!" and "Metal Hammer"; receiving critical acclaim from highly regarded rock journalist Chris Welch. Kim Fowley, manager of The Runaways, expressed an interest in the band. With U.K. live performances, interviews and reviews with "Sounds" (Mary Anne Hobbs), "Metal Hammer", "Kerrang" (Ray Zell), the band's popularity increased significantly in the UK Glam Rock scene.
The band did several shows at the Marquee Club. On the strength of the buzz created, a follow up single "So Alone" was recorded in the spring of 1988 at Oasis Studios and Unit 3 studios in Camden and was released late summer that year. 
"So Alone" EP.
The success of "Whatever happened To" EP and subsequent live shows led to further coverage in the form of interviews and reviews in the UK music press. Following a gig supporting Teenage Idols at the Marquee Club in 1988 Steevi Jaimz of Tigertailz allegedly punched a member of Soho Roses' entourage, triggering a notorious fight that resulted in Jaimz being ejected from the club. The press recognised a rebelliously comical undertone to this story. The band played at the 1998 Metal Hammer Xmas party at the London Astoria where Paul appeared on MTV.
"So Alone" was recorded in spring of 1988 at Oasis Studios and Unit 3 studios in Camden, London and released on their label Trash Can Records of London in August 1988, again with engineer and producer Colin Leggett, presented a more'polished, tighter sound, demonstrating how the band was evolving without compromising their trashy aesthetic.
"So Alone" received the accolade of 'single the century' from "Metal Hammer"'s Mark Day. Strangely, it received two reviews in this magazine. Fan loyalty meant it appeared in the 'Reader's Chart' of that magazine in August, September and October 1988.
"The Third and Final Insult".
Due to the rise of the American glam scene (Guns N' Roses etc) and differences in opinion regarding direction, in early 1989 Joolz announced that he wanted to leave the band triggering the mutual decision to split. In June 1989, days after a chaotic, swan song, sell-out gig at the Marquee Club, London, the band recorded "The Third and Final Insult" album.
This album was recorded by Andy Le Vien at RMS studios South Norwood London in 23.5 hrs from walking into the studio to walking out with the finished product. 
It was released in the UK late Autumn 1989 and was later re-released in 2007 in an American retrospective package called "Whatever Happened to... The Complete Works of Soho Roses". This was a special package release by American label Full Breach Kicks and included the total Soho Roses back catalogue including remixes of the "So Alone" EP from the original multi track recordings by guitarist Andy J. Davies who has become a respected figure in the underground punk world.
As fashionable LA bands such as Guns N' Roses and Poison increased in popularity in the UK, Soho Roses remained committed to their classic Glam Metal Punk influences like New York Dolls, Buzzcocks, and Sex Pistols. As the 1980s came to a close their distinctive punk sound was falling out of fashion, which increased their authenticity.
Soho Roses are influential and are still fondly remembered in the UK underground rock scene for their DIY attitude and playing the music they wanted to. They escaped the Glam backlash by splitting while they were still respected, making their legacy durable.
Post Break Up.
This attitude continued with each member's post Soho Roses career. Joolz joined The Wildhearts from August 1989 to mid 1991. Pat also spent time in The Wildhearts from early 1990 to October 1991. Later on both Joolz and Pat played in Guns n' Wankers, who released the album "For Dancing and Listening" on Fat Wreck Chords in 1994. The band's name was intended as a reference to their no nonsense role in the glam rock scene while other bands became increasingly corporate and insincere. Paul joined a band called Scarlet Tears. Andy went on to produce and play in various bands and work as a producer.

Saraana Bay

Saraana Bay is a freshwater body of the southwestern part of Gouin Reservoir, in the territory of the town of La Tuque, in the administrative region of Mauricie, in the province of Quebec, in Canada.
This bay extends into the townships of Crémazie (northern part), Évanturel (southern part) and Poisson (a bay on the west side). Following the completion of the Gouin Dam in 1948, the navigability area of Gouin Reservoir and Saraana Bay increased significantly. The water level can vary significantly depending on the management of the Gouin Dam; the level usually falls in late winter in anticipation of the spring freshet.
Recreotourism activities are the main economic activity of the sector. Forestry comes second.
The Forest Road R1009 passes from the west side of Mattawa Bay serving the lower Flapjack River into the northern part of Tessier Lake (Gouin Reservoir) (located south of Saraana Bay). and the southern part of Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir). This R1009 road joins the Southeast route 404 which serves the northern part of the Canadian National Railway.
The surface of Saraana Bay is usually frozen from mid-November to the end of April, however, safe ice circulation is usually from early December to the end of March.
Geography.
The main hydrographic slopes near Saraana Bay are:
On the east side, Saraana Bay is separated from Bureau Lake (Gouin Reservoir) by a peninsula advancing on to the North, almost to the village of Obedjiwan, Quebec. On the west side, Saraana Bay is separated from Mattawa Bay by a peninsula on the north-east of . This peninsula includes the "Pike Head Mountain" (elevation: ) on the east side of a strait connecting the northern part of Mattawa Bay with its South.
Saraana Bay is long and includes many islands, including “Aux Mouettes Island” and “Police Island”. Saraana Bay is fed by:
The mouth of Saraana Bay is located at:
The mouth of a width of of Saraana Bay is located to the northeast being barred by an island with a length of (west side of the river mouth) and a peninsula (on the east side) stretching westward . From there, the current crosses the "Bay of Rocher-Matci" which is attached to the Du Mâle Lake by the Kaopatinak pass.
From the mouth of Saraana Bay, the current flows over to Gouin Dam, according to the following segments:
From this dam, the current flows along the Saint-Maurice River to Trois-Rivières.
Toponymy.
In the Atikamek language, this hydronym translates as "Des-Filles-d'Anna" bay.
The toponym "Baie Saraana" was formalized on December 5, 1968, by the Commission de toponymie du Québec, i.e. when it was created.

Muhammad ibn Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Hasan al-Niffari

Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Hasan al-Niffarī, commonly known as al-Niffarī, was a 10th-century Sufi mystic.
Biography.
Muhammad ibn ‘Abd al-Jabbar ibn al-Hasan al-Niffarī died in the second half of the 10th-century somewhere in Egypt. There is confusion as to the exact year of his death, but a commonly accepted date is 965. Nothing is known of the place or date of his birth, but it is assumed that he is from or associated with the town of Niffar in present day Iraq, or the city of Nippur. Most of what is known about al-Niffarī is taken from the commentary by the 10th-century Sufi scholar Muhammad al-Hashimi al-Tilimsani. While he is relatively unknown and obscure, he is briefly mentioned by the scholars Ibn Arabi, Al-Sha`rani, and Haji Khalifa.

According to al-Tilimsani, the written works attributed to al-Niffarī were not actually written by him. Rather, al-Niffarī wrote down his revelations on scraps of paper and these were compiled by one of his followers, either his son or his grandson; as such, it is unclear whether his revelations were meant to collected and published. Two large collections of al-Niffarī's works exist today, both written in Arabic.
Al-Mawāqif.
The more prominent and seminal of these collected works is "al-Kitāb al-Mawāqif" (The Book of Standings). Al-Niffarī used the basical radical w/q/f (to stand) but uses a causative form to indicate an act of being stood up by the divine presence. As such, much of his work depicts an intimate relationship and unity with the divine presence, reflecting the author's attainment of "fanā"' (dissolution of the ego). These spiritual standings/stayings begin with versions of the phrase "He stayed me", referring to the same causative act. Furthermore, the standings reflect the eminence of the apocalyptic vision and the eschatological revelation, and the polarity of the experience of divine unity that switches between peace and terror. Finally, al-Niffarī purposefully uses unclear pronouns when referring to himself and the divine presence to highlight the confusion and the dissolution of the barrier between the two entities as they merge into one being.
Al-Mukhātabāt.
The other collection of writings by al-Niffarī is "al-Mukhātabāt", which refer to a series of spiritual addresses from the divine presence addressed to His servant, i.e. the author.

East Asian languages

The East Asian languages are a language family (alternatively "macrofamily" or "superphylum") first proposed by linguist Stanley Starosta in 2001. The proposal has also since been adopted by other linguists such as George van Driem. It comprises most languages situated within East and Southeast Asia, who are believed to have derived from a common proto-language located in China.
Classifications.
Early proposals.
Early proposals of similar linguistic macrophyla, in narrower scope:
Precursors to the East Asian proposal:
Starosta (2005).
Stanley Starosta's (2005) East Asian proposal includes a "Yangzian" branch, consisting of Austroasiatic and Hmong–Mien, to form an East Asian superphylum. However, Starosta believes his proposed Yangzian to be a direct sister of Sino-Tibetan rather than Austronesian, which is more distantly related to Sino-Tibetan as a sister of Sino-Tibetan-Yangzian. He concludes Proto-East Asian was a disyllabic (CVCVC) language spoken from 6,500 to 6,000 BCE by Peiligang culture and Cishan culture millet farmers on the North China Plain (specifically the Han River, Wei River, and central Yellow River areas).
Starosta (2005) proposes the following Proto-East Asian morphological affixes, which are found in Proto-Tibeto-Burman and Proto-Austronesian, as well as in some morphologically conservative Austroasiatic branches such as Nicobaric.
van Driem (2012).
The following tree of East Asian superphylum (macrofamily) was proposed by George van Driem in 2012 at the 18th Himalayan Languages Symposium, held at the Benares Hindu University.
According to van Driem, the linguistic evidence for the East Asian languages matches the genetic evidence from Y-DNA Haplogroup O. (Further information: Father Tongue hypothesis)
Larish (2006, 2017).
According to Michael D. Larish, the languages of Southeast and East Asia descended from one proto-language (which he calls "Proto-Asian"). Japonic is grouped together with Koreanic as one branch of the Proto-Asian family. The other branch consists of the Austronesian, Austroasiatic, Kra-Dai, Hmong-Mien and Sino-Tibetan languages.
Vocabulary comparison.
Below is a comparison of basic vocabulary items for proto-languages of all 5 East Asian language families.

Zhang Decheng

Zhang Decheng or Chang De-Cheng (; 1846 – late-July 1900) was a Chinese nationalist and leader of the Fists of Harmony and Justice during the Boxer Uprising. Though working as a boatman during his youth, he would spend much of the Boxer Rebellion as a leader of the group he created, the Fists of Harmony and Justice.
Biography.
Born in either Zhaozhang or Goucun village in the Zhili Province of the Qing Dynasty, Zhang would spend much of his youth as a boatman along the Daqing, Ziya, and other rivers in Zhili.
As time went on and foreign contacts in Northern China increased, particularly the actions of western missionaries, Zhang and other similar-minded individuals would set out to "destroy foreigners". Though the Fists of Harmony and Justice did exist during the mid-1890s, they proved only to be a minor inconvenience to any official Qing or foreign affairs due to the group's small size, lack of influence, and mostly local actions taken by bands of around 50 men each. In 1899, a compatriot of Zhang, Zhao Sandu set out to establish order in the Fists of Harmony and Justice's ranks during a conference at the Yaoli Yaowang Temple in Wangkou. Both Zhang Decheng and Cao Futian would develop the creation of the First Heavenly Regiment, along with the structure of their organisation, which was as follows:
Though central structure for the organisation was formed, the group relied on a system of small groups of men under local leaders, which was to be replaced (in some capacity) by the new First Heavenly Regiment. And for this new group that was created, Zhang required more members for his group, which was done by trying to convince Boxer followers that he had magical abilities. He supposedly hid a knife in the ground, somewhere in Tianjin, and then claimed that this place was "dangerous". His followers then dug up the area and found the knife, and were convinced that Zhang did indeed possess supernatural powers. In early 1900, he proclaimed himself "Number One Boxer" and said he had a mandate from the gods. He led at that time several thousand followers.
In early June 1900, Zhang Decheng went to see the Viceroy of Zhili, Yu Lu. He presented himself to him as the founder of the Boxer movement, and the viceroy promised to provide the Boxers with money and equipment.
For many, he was considered as the supreme Boxer leader.

Mary K. Okheena

Mary Kapbak Okheena (also goes by Memorana, Krappak, Kappak) is an Inuvialuit graphic artist known for her stencil prints including "Musk-ox Waiting for the Tide to Cross Water" (1986) and "Shaman Dances to Northern Lights" (1991), drawings and embroidery. She is part of the third generation of organized graphic artists in the Canadian Arctic. Okheena has five children with her husband Eddie and she currently lives in Inuvik where she practices embroidery and makes wall hangings.
Biography.
Early life.
Okheena was born in 1957 in Holman (Uluqsaqtuuq), King’s Bay, Victoria Island, Northwest Territories. Her father Jimmy Memorana was a sculptor and printmaker and helped found the Holman Island Eskimo Co-operative. Her mother, Nora Memorana, was an expert sewer. Both Jimmy and Nora were respected drum dancers in their communities. Okheena grew up watching her father and her aunt Agnes Nanogak Goose make prints for the Holman Print Shop (part of the Holman Island Eskimo Co-operative) inspiring her career in printing.
Career.
Mary K. Okheena started drawing in her teens and at the age of nineteen. In 1977 she sold her first drawing. She was invited by Father Henri Tardy to help with stencil printing after she made a large embroidery design for his church. Father Tardy, who introduced printmaking to Holman, taught Okheena how to make waxed-paper stencils. She started printing in 1977 when John Rose, the Holman Print Shop manager, asked her to come and learn printmaking. Okheena began her professional printing career by printing other artists’ images, which are included in annual Holman print collections from 1979 and 1980-1981. In 1986, Okheena began printing her own works at the Holman Print Shop after her prints were rejected by the Canadian Eskimo Council in 1984. Between 1977 and 1982, Okheena intermittently worked at the Holman Print Shop during the birth and infancy of her eldest children. Okheena worked for the Holman Print Shop longer than any artist currently working there.
She eventually left the print shop partly because of health problems caused by printmaking chemicals and set up a home studio. Okheena also spends her time crocheting, quilting, carving, making wall hangings, and sewing clothing for her family.
Okheena has also illustrated John Bierhorst’s 1997 children’s book called "The Dancing Fox: Arctic Folktales".
Artwork.
Print.
Mary K. Okheena uses a specific stencil technique in her prints to achieve subtle and luminous gradations of colour. Okheena abstracts formal qualities of animal and human forms. She is often inspired by children’s facial expressions, and often uses culturally symbolic images in her work such as the inukshuk. She has created her own form of storytelling, by reflecting the dual traditions of Holman Inuvialuit families and those of the resident Copper Inuit (as seen in "Shaman Dances to Northern Lights"). She combines an Inuit aesthetic with influence from Southern culture and uses Western artistic devices. 
Over her career, she has had 74 of her drawings made into prints, and 36 she printed herself. She has also printed 31 works from other artists’ designs. In 1988, Mary K. Okheena was commissioned to create a print for the cover of the Northwest Territories Telephones’ telephone directory.
Public collections.
A number of museums and galleries that have her prints in their permanent collections include the Canadian Museum of History, Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre in Yellowknife, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Winnipeg Art Gallery.

James Mastin

James Richard Mastin (1935–2016) was an American sculptor and painter, best known for his public monuments of life-sized bronze figures commemorating significant historical events and individuals. The hallmark of his work was meticulous craftsmanship and emotional content.
His most recognized public works are the Bahamian National Monument, "Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden" in Green Turtle Cay, The Bahamas, the "Key West Historical Memorial Sculpture Garden" in Key West, Florida, and "Les Chasseurs Volontaires" (commemorating The Siege of Savannah) in Savannah, Georgia.
The Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden was declared a national monument of The Bahamas. It consists of a central monument depicting two Loyalist women arriving in The Bahamas surrounded by 24 busts of descendants of Loyalist families. The Loyalists were those individuals who remained loyal to the British Crown after the American war of independence in 1776. Many Loyalists in the northern American colonies fled to Canada, while Loyalists in the more southern American colonies fled to the islands of the Bahamas with their slaves. The Loyalist Memorial Sculpture Garden was commissioned by the Historical Society of Green Turtle Cay.
The Key West Historical Memorial Sculpture Garden was commissioned by the Friends of Mallory Square, Key West. Its central monument, "The Wreckers" pays tribute to the brave men engaged in salvage operations that made Key West the richest city on the east coast of the United States south of New York in the nineteenth century.
Les Chasseurs Volontaires ("Siege of Savannah") was commissioned by the Haitian American Historical Society and the City of Savannah, and commemorates the free Haitian soldiers who successfully fought in the American Revolution in 1776 alongside the American colonial army in Savannah, Georgia to assist in the American efforts towards independence from Great Britain. The drummer boy depicted in the monument was a young Henri Christophe, who became one of the original leaders of the Haitian government, after Haiti obtained its independence from France.
Mastin also created a maquette, or model, for a larger than life-sized sculpture he contemplated called "Circle of Love" to celebrate the native American Lucayan people who lived in South Florida and in the Caribbean basin at the time of the arrival of European immigrants from Spain.
Early life and education.
James Mastin was born in South Dakota, but grew up in Los Angeles, California. He was a classically trained artist, with degrees from Pasadena City College, the Art Center of Los Angeles, the Los Angeles County Art Institute, the Chouinard Art Institute, and studied under Sergei Bongart, as well as the Massachusetts Conservatory of Art and Music.
Career.
Mastin originally pursued an acting career and sold artwork to support his studies. After military service, he opened a commercial art studio in California. A large number of his paintings were put into print by Windsor Art. In the 1960s Mastin traveled the American Southwest, painting portraits of Native Americans. He began sculpting in the 1970s, primarily working in clay and wax, as well as plaster and resins. He moved to Miami, Florida in the 1970s and opened his permanent art studio, James Mastin Galleries. He remained in Miami until his death.
Over the course of his career, Mastin created many allegorical, figurative, and abstract works exploring the human condition, and explored a variety of media and styles. Although his monumental, public works were heroic figurative pieces full of emotion, his personal work included oil, acrylic, and watercolor landscapes, abstracts, and portraits. He also experimented with mixed media, incorporating lights and sound generated by video images, LED light arrays, mirrors, and water elements. For his monumental work, Mastin sculpted in clay, casting his pieces in bronze using the ancient lost wax method of casting, finishing them with a chemical patina to add color and protect the pieces from the elements.
Cultural activities.
James Mastin was also an accomplished singer, pianist, and actor, and performed concerts in The Bahamas and Florida. He collaborated with Alton Roland Lowe to establish the Albert Lowe Museum in Green Turtle Cay, The Bahamas. He was also a member of The Bakehouse Art Complex, 2+3 The Artists Collaborative, and the Civic Chorale of Miami.

Stomach Trouble

Stomach Trouble is a 1927 silent animated short starring the comic strip character Krazy Kat. The short was released by Winkler Pictures.
Plot.
The cartoon starts in a house where Krazy wakes up from his bed. He then heads to the refrigerator to get some breakfast. To his surprise, he finds his refrigerator empty, and notices he desperately needs to fill his belly.
Krazy goes outside to look for anything to satisfy his hunger. He spots a pie placed on a window sill of another house but the owner removes it before Krazy could get near. He tries to take sausages from a basket carried by a hound but the long meats are too tricky to handle. He then attempts to take a sandwich from a steamer owned by a mime but the mime notices this immediately before taking back the cookware and fleeing.
While still looking for ways to obtain food, Krazy sees a chef carrying a platter with a roasted turkey on top, heading towards a prison. As he follows the chef, the cat sips the sauce that drips from the plate. Looking through a prison window, Krazy sees the turkey being served to a prisoner, giving him the notion that he too should be a prisoner. Krazy goes on to annoy the prison guard, even breaking the officer's billy club, until he is finally thrown into a cell. Inside his cell, Krazy is excited that he prepares some utensils. To his dismay, the guard only offers him tea. Krazy complains to the guard, who discloses that the other prisoner will be executed tomorrow, and therefore deserves some special treatment. Krazy faints in embarrassment.

Fawdon Wagonway

The Fawdon Wagonway was from 1818 to 1826 a long horse-drawn and partially rope-operated industrial railway in Fawdon near Newcastle upon Tyne. It was the first cable car employing a moving rope that could be picked up or released by a grip on the cars.
History.
Fawdon Colliery was set-up around 1810, and its coal was originally transported via the Kenton and Coxlodge Waggonway to Wallsend. In 1818, the Fawdon Wagonway was built by Benjamin Thompson, one of the partners owning Fawdon Colliery on a new route to transport the coal south to Scotswood. The line used inclined planes and stationary steam engines. The re-routing was the cause of controversial discussions between Thompson and the owners of the properties, over which the track ran.
Benjamin Thompson installed a series of stationary steam engines along the rail track between the Kenton Bank and Hotchpudding Planes. Stationary steam engines transported the coal wagons through the hilly landscape at a speed of . 
Each rope ran between two steam engines and could be alternately wound onto drums at the ends by the engines. Its length corresponded to twice the distance between the steam engines. The rope could be clamped by a grip that looked like a vice attached to the carriage. At the point where the railway crossed a public road, the rope was guided by friction rollers down a cable duct and under a plank bridge to the other side of the road, where it again rose above the ground. Before the car came to the public road, the boy who rode on it released the rope from the vice. The momentum of the car carried it across the road, and the boy hung the rope back into the vice as the car continued its movement.
The inclined plane was used until 1826, when the Brunton and Shields Wagonway (later Seaton Burn Wagonway) was built to the River Tyne at Whitehill Point.
The routes of the Fawdon and Seaton Burn Wagonways were used in the 1890s together with the route of the Coxlodge Wagonway for building the Fawdon Railway.
The 1920s Ordnance Survey map showed a new Fawdon wagonway leading to the Coxlodge Colliery Jubilee Pit.
The wagonway is still preserved as a low earthwork on which an asphalt road runs. Archeological excavations were conducted in Newcastle Great Park in 2003.

Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019

Sweden participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019. The Swedish broadcaster Sveriges Television (SVT) organised the national final "Melodifestivalen 2019" in order to select the Swedish entry for the 2019 contest in Tel Aviv, Israel. After a six-week-long competition consisting of four semi-finals, a Second Chance round and a final, "Too Late for Love" performed by John Lundvik emerged as the winner after achieving the highest score following the combination of votes from eight international juries and a public vote.
Background.
Prior to the 2019 contest, Sweden had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fifty-eight times since its first entry in . Sweden had won the contest on six occasions: in 1974 with the song "Waterloo" performed by ABBA, in 1984 with the song "Diggi-Loo Diggi-Ley" performed by Herreys, in 1991 with the song "Fångad av en stormvind" performed by Carola, in 1999 with the song "Take Me to Your Heaven" performed by Charlotte Nilsson, in 2012 with the song "Euphoria" performed by Loreen, and in 2015 with the song "Heroes" performed by Måns Zelmerlöw. Following the introduction of semi-finals for the , Sweden's entries, to this point, have featured in every final except for 2010 when the nation failed to qualify.
The Swedish national broadcaster, Sveriges Television (SVT), broadcasts the event within Sweden and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. Since 1959, SVT has organised the annual competition "Melodifestivalen" in order to select the Swedish entry for the Eurovision Song Contest.
Before Eurovision.
"Melodifestivalen 2019".
Melodifestivalen 2019 was the 58th edition of the Swedish music competition Melodifestivalen and will be held between 2 February 2019 and 9 March 2019. The four presenters were Sarah Dawn Finer, Kodjo Akolor, Marika Carlsson and Eric Saade. The winner of the contest will represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2019 in Tel Aviv, Israel.
Final.
The final took place on 9 March 2019 at the Friends Arena in Solna, Stockholm. Twelve songs competed — two qualifiers from each of the four preceding semi-finals and four qualifiers from the Second Chance round. The combination of points from a viewer vote and eight international jury groups determined the winner, John Lundvik with the song "Too Late for Love". The viewers and the juries each had a total of 464 points to award. The nations that comprised the international jury were , , , , , , and .
At Eurovision.
According to Eurovision rules, all nations with the exceptions of the host country and the "Big 5" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests, with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot. On 28 January 2019, a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi-finals, as well as which half of the show they would perform in. Sweden was placed into the second semi-final, to be held on 16 May 2019, and was scheduled to perform in the first half of the show.
Once all the competing songs for the 2019 contest had been released, the running order for the semi-finals was decided by the shows' producers rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. Sweden was set to perform in position 8, following the entry from Denmark and preceding the entry from Austria.
Semi-final.
Sweden performed eighth in the second semi-final, following the entry from Denmark and preceding the entry from Austria. At the end of the show, Sweden was announced as having finished in the top 10 and subsequently qualifying for the grand final. It was later revealed that Sweden placed third in the semi-final, receiving a total of 238 points: 88 points from the televoting and 150 points from the juries.
Voting.
Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final.
Detailed voting results.

Members of this gens are first mentioned in the time of Cicero, and from that time they attained particular distinction as statesmen and writers. The most illustrious of the family was the historian Gaius Sallustius Crispus, who wrote valuable works on the Jugurthine War and the Conspiracy of Catiline, which still exist.
Praenomina.
The main praenomina of the Sallustii of the Republic and early Empire were "Gaius", "Gnaeus", and "Publius". Other names appear in imperial times, including "Marcus" and "Quintus". All of these were among the most common names throughout Roman history.
Branches and cognomina.
The only cognomen borne by the Sallustii of the Republic was "Crispus", belonging to an abundant class of surnames derived from the physical features of an individual, and originally belonging to someone with curly hair. "Passienus", borne by some of the Sallustii during the early decades of the Empire, was a gentile name inherited from the paternal line when one of the Passieni was adopted by his granduncle, the historian Sallust, becoming part of his gens. "Lucullus", borne by an ill-fated member of this family in the time of Domitian, may have been derived from "lucus", a grove, although it might also have been a diminutive of the praenomen "Lucius".

Death of Keane Wallis-Bennett

On 1 April 2014, shortly after 10 a.m., Keane Wallis-Bennett, a 12 year old girl died whilst changing for a gym class at Liberton High School, Edinburgh, Scotland. A prefabricated wall in the middle of the changing room collapsed and, unlike the other girls, Wallis-Bennett was not fast enough jumping out of the way. The purpose of the free-standing wall was to provide privacy whilst changing and showering. Pupils at the school had complained about the wall being unstable some months before, but nothing had been done. Surveyors had not identified the wall as needing repairs. At least 13 schools were subsequently identified as having similar walls. There had been other problems with the buildings at Liberton High School. In December 2011, a 15-year-old student was injured after falling down a lift shaft. Wallis-Bennett's funeral was held at Mortonhall Crematorium.
British prime minister, David Cameron, said "It was an absolutely shocking accident... Clearly the lessons will have to be learned to make sure that tragic accidents like that cannot happen again."

Zwiesel Forest Museum

The Zwiesel Forest Museum () in the town of Zwiesel on "Kirchplatz 3" is a cultural and natural history museum in the Lower Bavarian county of Regen. It is housed in a building formerly part of a girls' school run by an English sister. The exhibition is elaborated in German and Czech. The building also serves as the cultural centre for the town of Zwiesel.
General.
In the late 19th century a wave of museums were founded in Bavaria, which also affected Zwiesel. From 1904, documents and artefacts from the history of Zwiesel were collected and, one year later, a municipal museum was established, which was housed on the upper floor of the local mortuary. The collection grew steadily and the existing premises became too small. In 1924, the museum found a new home in the former community brewery and later in the fire brigade equipment house on the town square.
In the 1960s, its thematic focus changed. Oberforstrat Konrad Klotz (1905-1994), head of the Zwiesel forestry office, and Georg Priehäußer (1894-1974) worked towards a new concept for the museum. In 1966 they succeeded in establishing the first German forest museum in Zwiesel. The flora and fauna of the forest, as well as the subject of "wood", became the central features. These areas were supplemented by municipal and regional history as well as by the theme of "glass" for Zwiesel, which was indispensable given the centrality of glassmaking in the town.
Unusual exhibits such as the trunk details of a 400-year-old fir tree or a jungle diorama were integrated into the concept.
In 2014, the contents and design of the Forest Museum were revised once again and moved to the former girls' school on "Kirchplatz", which is located right next to the neo-Gothic church of St. Nicholas.

Bayryasova Kisyakbika

Kisyakbika Bayryasova is forcibly baptized Muslim woman, sentenced to be burned for returning to Islam.
Political situation in the province.
Kysyabika Bayryasova was born in 1679 in the Duvanskoy volost of the Siberian road in Russia. At the beginning of the 18th century the so-called "mountain power" was created in the Urals. Vasily Tatishchev, known as the founder of the city of Yekaterinburg, the author of the book "The History of Russia" was the head of the "mountain power". At that time, the active development of new deposits began, new plants and mines were built in the province. The local population the Bashkirs feared losing their patrimonial rights to lands obtained under the conditions of accession to Russia, and sought to protect their cultural, religious and domestic traditions. The discontent of the people have caused a Bashkir rebellion of 1735–1740. On the rebellion "mountain power" responded with punitive campaigns. Residents of insurgent villages were killed, sold into slavery, forcibly baptized. Bashkir woman Kisyakbika Bayryasova was captured by punitive power and have brought to Ekaterinburg. She was given as serf to the writer and translator Kiriak Kondratovich. She was baptized, and after baptism she was named Katerina.
Like the rest of the slaves, Kisyakbika dreamed of freedom. September 18, 1737, she made her first escape with another slave. The old woman was caught and whipped. But the freedom-loving woman did not stop this. On September 26 of the same year Kisyakbika made her second escape from Ekaterinburg with the secretary of the manager of the "mountain power". Kisyabika was caught and this time was carved with a whip.
Meanwhile, on April 20, 1738, the execution of Toigilda Zhulyakov was executed. He was also forcibly baptized, but he returned to Islam. All the Bashkirs of Yekaterinburg and its environs were taken to the place of Toigilda burning. Toyhildy Zhilyakov was burned at the stake in front of his children. But Kisiakbika did not stop before the fear of being burnt. In September 1738, she ran for the third time.
February 8, 1739 In the Office of the "mountain power" was decided to burn Kisyabika Bayrasova on fire for returning to Islam and for three escapes.
A month later, after the publication of the decid of Kisyabika Bayrasova was executed on the central square of Yekaterinburg.

Alice Greenwood

Alice Drayton Greenwood (1862–1935) was a British historian, teacher and writer.
Life.
Greenwood was born in Chorlton, in Lancashire on 18 November 1862. Her father was Joseph Gouge Greenwood and her mother was Elizabeth (Eliza) Taylor. Her maternal grandfather was Unitarian minister John Taylor. Alice had a younger sister and her mother died in 1871. The sisters were brought up in Fallowfield after her father remarried. Her father's career in teaching went well and he rose to be a Professor of History and Classics. In 1857 he was made principal of Owen's College. In 1880 he became the vice-chancellor of Victoria University whilst Alice was at Cheltenham Ladies' College. In 1882 she left the college and she was able to side step the discrimination to women at Victoria University. Her father was generally supportive of her education and she was able to avoid the rule that prevented women from entering the university by attending lectures held by the university in Brunswick Street. She was mentored by the Latin professor Augustus Samuel Wilkins and by Herman Hager who taught German literature, but importantly, she was spotted by Adolphus William Ward who was professor of English language and history.
After two years at Somerville Hall Greenwood and Gertrude Bell won the only first class honours degrees awarded to women that year. Oxford University recorded nine men at the time and ignored the two women. Some sources say that Bell was the only and first woman that year.
In 1888 Greenwood started teaching at Clifton High School for Girls where she found that she liked teaching but did not want to become an administrator. She moved on to North Manchester High School for Girls four years later. In 1892 she completed her first book "Europe and Papacy in the Middle Ages".
Greenwood was in contact with her former mentor, Adolphus Ward, who succeeded her father at Owen's College. He was starting a school for girls in Manchester and in 1896 she became the second headteacher of Withington Girls' School.
She decided, in 1900, to devote her time to writing and she resigned her headship of Withington Girls School. She continued to work with Adolphus Ward, as he was the editor of "The Cambridge Modern History", from 1901 and he was the co-editor of the "Cambridge History of English Literature" from 1907. Greenwood completed numerous tasks for both of these works and was credited with chapters in the "Cambridge History of English Literature". In 1907 and 1911 she published two volumes of the "Lives of the Hanoverian Queens of England". Her thorough research was noted for its lack of speculation; she stated the known facts about the women and did not pad out the work with facts about Hanoverian men. She did, however, take a subjective view of history from her Queen's point of view.
The second volume of "Lives of the Hanoverian Queens of England" was published while she was at Oxford as she moved to St Hugh's College in 1910 where she became involved in the running of the college.
Greenwood continued to write and in 1921 she published "History of the People of England - Vol. I - 55 B.C. to A.D. 1485".
She and a teaching friend named Helen Turing retired together to London and then on to Somerset where Greenwood died at Williton in 1935.

Moose Lallo

Morris G. "Moose" Lallo (also known as Maurice; September 25, 1924September 1, 2020), was a Canadian ice hockey player, coach, and general manager. He played in over 1000 professional games during 19 seasons in the minor leagues. He played on five championship teams, and was named a first-team all-star in both the International Hockey League and the Eastern Hockey League.
Lallo became a player-coach in 1960, then later became a full-time head coach and general manager which lasted for 24 seasons. During his first 17 seasons of coaching with the Muskegon Zephyrs and Muskegon Mohawks, his teams won the Fred A. Huber Trophy seven times as regular season champions, made the playoffs 13 times, and won the Turner Cup twice. He coached another seven seasons after leaving Muskegon and was named the IHL Coach of the Year five times. He later coached in the Atlantic Coast Hockey League and won two more championships in the Continental Hockey League. He achieved 823 coaching victories in 1531 games and was inducted into the Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1993.
Early playing career.
Lallo was born on September 25, 1924, in Montreal, Quebec, and was also known as Maurice.
Lallo began his professional hockey career in the 1944–45 season, and was a member of the Boston Olympics team that won the Eastern Amateur Hockey League (EAHL) championship, despite not playing a game in the playoffs. The Olympics won another EAHL championship in the 1945–46 season, but Lallo played only 27 games in a shortened season, and missed out on skating in the playoffs again. After one year off, Lallo played with the San Diego Skyhawks in the Pacific Coast Hockey League (PCHL), and racked up 136 penalty minutes in just 48 games in the 1947–48 season. He won the PCHL championship with San Diego, in the 1948–49 season, his third title as a player. Lallo played one more season in San Diego, then took a year off, and began the 1951–52 season with Moncton Hawks in the Maritime Major Hockey League. After five games in Moncton, he moved to New Haven in the EAHL. Lallo scored 18 goals in two seasons in New Haven, and accrued 239 penalty minutes.
Lallo earned a spot with the Grand Rapids Rockets in the International Hockey League (IHL) for the 1953–54 IHL season. Despite playing in a higher-level league, he posted personal bests with 12 goals, 40 points, and 152 penalty minutes. In the 1954–55 IHL season, Lallo scored another personal best of 22 goals, and had a career high of 194 penalty minutes. He was voted an IHL first-team all-star for the season. He returned to Grand Rapids for the 1955–56 IHL season, scoring 15 goals, and cut down penalty minutes to 76. He was signed by the Huntington Hornets for the 1956–57 IHL season.
After four seasons in the IHL, Lallo was signed to the Washington Presidents in the Eastern Hockey League, by the same owners from his New Haven seasons. In the 1957–58 season, he played 49 games and had only 44 penalty minutes, and won his fourth playoffs championship with Washington. In the 1958–59 season, he scored a personal best 23 goals, and 55 points, earning an EHL first-team all-star award. Lallo split the 1959–60 season between Washington and Philadelphia, playing 63 games, scoring 15 goals.
Playing style.
Lallo was considered a colourful spirit and a rugged defenceman. He was known for delivering hard body checks, and playing old-time hockey while losing teeth. Lallo never wore shoulder pads which helped him develop a hip check while defending. He considered himself a "rough and tough hockey player, but never dirty".
Zephyrs player-coach.
Lallo was recruited to join the International Hockey League expansion team in Muskegon, by Jerry DeLise, the same team owner who brought him to New Haven, then Washington. Lallo was also assigned the duties of player-coach of the Muskegon Zephyrs at age 36. In the 1960–61 IHL season, he played 65 games, scored 11 goals, earned 117 penalty minutes, and made the playoffs finishing third in the east. Lallo led the team through playoff upsets against the second-place Fort Wayne Komets, and the first-place Toledo Mercurys to reach the finals, but lost in five games to the St. Paul Saints.
Lallo had his best offensive career output during the 1961–62 IHL season, scoring 24 goals, and 72 points, and earned a second-team all-star honour as a defenceman. As the coach, he led the team to first place overall in the regular season, winning the Fred A. Huber Trophy with 43 wins, and 88 points. In the playoffs, Muskegon defeated the third-place Minneapolis Millers 4 games to 1, and then swept the second-place St. Paul Saints in the finals to win the Turner Cup. It was Lallo's fifth championship as a player, and the first professional championship season for any Muskegon sports team. Lallo was named a first-team all-star coach, the equivalent to coach of the year, when the Commissioner's Trophy was later introduced.
In the 1962–63 IHL season, Lallo played all 70 games, scoring 10 goals. The Zephyrs finished third place in a close race, only two points behind the first-place Fort Wayne Komets. In the playoffs, Muskegon lost in six games to the Komets. In the 1963–64 IHL season, Lallo again played all 70 games, and netted 14 goals. In another close race in the standings, Muskegon finished sixth place out the playoffs, only two points out of fourth place. Before the 1964–65 IHL season, Lallo stepped down from his coaching duties to concentrate on his final season of play, and Lorne Davis took over as player-coach. Lallo again played all 70 games, scoring 8 goals. He retired from playing at age 41, with 1086 games played.
Mohawks head coach.
Lallo was hired as a full-time coach and general manager for the 1965–66 IHL season, and the Zephyrs were renamed the Muskegon Mohawks. In his first season behind the bench, he led the Mohawks to 46 wins, and first place in the season, winning a second Huber Trophy. In the playoffs, Muskegon stumbled, losing in four games straight to the Port Huron Flags. After the season, Lallo received his second first-team all-star coach nomination. In the 1966–67 IHL season, Muskegon had a lot of players move on, and finished sixth place, 20 points out of the playoffs. Lallo regrouped for the 1967–68 IHL season, and returned to first place with 43 wins, 98 points, and a third Huber Trophy. In the playoffs, Muskegon defeated the third-place Columbus Checkers four games to none, and then defeated the Dayton Gems four games to one, winning the IHL championship. It was the second Turner Cup for Lallo as a coach, and he was honoured with his third coach of the year award.
In the 1968–69 IHL season, he led Muskegon to 34 wins, and a third-place finish. In the playoffs, Muskegon won all three games in round-robin play, then defeated the Toledo Blades in a five-game series, then lost in three games straight to Dayton in the finals. The league split into two divisions for the 1969–70 IHL season, and the Mohawks earned 46 wins, 100 points, won the north division, and first overall in the league, capturing a fourth Huber Trophy for Lallo. In the playoffs, Muskegon faced the south division winning Dayton Gems in a best-of-seven series, but lost in six games. Lallo received his fourth coach of the year award in 1970. In the 1970–71 IHL season, he led Muskegon to 43 wins, 91 points, and another first-place finish in the IHL, and his fifth Huber Trophy as coach. In the playoffs, the Mohawks fell in six games to sixth-place Port Huron. In the 1971–72 IHL season, Lallo achieved a third consecutive Huber Trophy, and his sixth overall, leading the Mohawks to 49 wins and 100 points. In the playoffs, he led his team past the Dayton Gems in five games, into the finals versus the Port Huron Wings, but lost in six games. The season earned Lallo his fifth coach of year award, and fourth in the last seven years.
Lallo became a part-owner of the team for the 1972–73 IHL season, and stepped back from coaching, to focus on his managing duties. Bryan McLay became the player-coach, but after 55 games, and the team struggling, Lallo returned behind the bench. In the final 29 games of the season, he led the team to 17 victories, but missed the playoffs by one point. Lallo remained as coach for the 1973–74 IHL season, and led Muskegon to 44 wins, and first in the north division. In the playoffs, they were defeated in three games by the Columbus Owls. In the 1974–75 IHL season, Lallo improved the team to 48 wins, 99 points, first overall in the IHL, and his seventh Huber Trophy. Muskegon defeated Port Huron in five games in the first round of the playoffs, but lost in seven games against the Saginaw Gears in the second round. Both Lallo, and McLay had their contracts renewed after two first-place finishes.
The 1975–76 IHL season would be Lallo's final full season coaching Muskegon. He led the Mohawks to 34 wins, 81 points, and a fourth-place finish in the north. The team fell to first-place Saginaw in five games in the first round of the playoffs. McLay retired from playing, and took over a head coach, and Lallo remained as team president and general manager. With the team struggling forty-four games into the 1976–77 IHL season, Lallo returned behind the bench with and led the team to fourth place. In the playoffs, Muskegon took first place Saginaw to seven games in the first round before the season ended. Lallo began the 1977–78 IHL season as coach, but stepped aside after 44 games in favour of McLay. With the team performing poorly, he later resigned his general manager post on March 9, 1978, ending eighteen years with the organization.
Later coaching career.
Lallo became head coach of the Fort Wayne Komets for the 1978–79 IHL season. He led the team to 45 wins, 96 points, and second overall in the league. In the playoffs, his team defeated the Toledo Goaldiggers in six games, but lost to the first-place Grand Rapids Owls in seven games. He returned for the 1979–80 IHL season, and his Komets finished first in the south division with 40 wins, and 93 points. In the playoffs, he led Fort Wayne past Toledo in four straight games, and Saginaw in five games. In his sixth IHL finals, Lallo and Fort Wayne lost in six games to the Kalamazoo Wings, in a bid for his third Turner Cup. The 1980–81 IHL season, was Lallo's 20th and final season in the IHL. He coached Fort Wayne to his 15th winning season with 37 wins and second place in the west division. His team defeated the Milwaukee Admirals in five games in the first round, but lost to Saginaw in five games in round two. His contract was not renewed after the season.
Lallo had initially retired after his departure from the IHL, but decided that he missed hockey enough to agree to a one-year contract with the rebranded Baltimore Skipjacks of the Atlantic Coast Hockey League. He coached his new team to 47 points in 48 games, finished third place in the 1981–82 ACHL season. His Skipjacks team almost upset the second place Mohawk Valley Stars, but lost in a close seven game series.
Lallo began the 1982–83 season with the Decatur Blues, in the semi-professional Continental Hockey League, but team folded after only five games. He was recruited by fellow Quebecker and former IHL coach Maurice Benoît, who was the general manager and coach of the Troy Bruins, and Lallo took over coaching duties of the Bruins. Lallo led the Sabres to 23 wins, in only 37 games, and the CHL championship, his third playoffs title. Troy repeated another first-place finish in the 1983–84 season, and another CHL championship, Lallo's fourth playoffs title. The Sabres were in first place during the 1984–85 season, but Lallo was fired due to financial issues.
Later life and honours.
Lallo was named the IHL Coach of the Year five times. He was inducted into the Muskegon Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1993. His uniform # 2 was retired in his honour in Muskegon.
Lallo died on September 1, 2020 in Pompano Beach, Florida.

Linda Miller (engineer)

Linda Jean Miller (born 1961) is an American civil engineer who works for Bechtel. She is currently director of the excavation works for the Sydney Metro project, having recently been in charge of Crossrail's Farringdon Station.
Education.
Miller is from Arizona. She has a bachelor's degree in engineering from United States Military Academy in West Point, New York. After graduating, Miller started her career in the United States Army, where she flew helicopters. She earned a master's degree in engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.
Career.
Miller has worked as Bechtel for more than 25 years. Throughout her career she has been a champion of engineering projects that leave a positive legacy. While working on the Boston Central Artery, a 161-mile road and tunnel project, she appeared on a PBS documentary. She worked on a new launch project at Cape Canaveral and the Seattle Monorail Project.
She worked on the Connaught Tunnel, a Victorian rail tunnel built in 1878 between Stratford and North Woolwich. At the start the team only had 135 year-old drawings as a guide, and had to use giant props to support the excavation. She described the project as 'open heart surgery'. She thinks it is "boom time" for tunnelling, with new technology putting the UK at the cutting-edge. She was seconded as project manager of Farringdon station. The station includes platform and concourse tunnels, ticket halls, escalators, and adits built using sprayed concrete lining. In March 2017, Miller left the UK and moved to Australia to begin work on the Sydney Metro.

William U. McCabe

William U. McCabe (1880 – May 5, 1931) was an attorney and politician from Mountain Home, Arkansas. He served in the Arkansas Senate from 1921 to 1924, and the Arkansas House of Representatives from January 1931 until his death on May 6, 1931. McCabe worked to reform the Arkansas Constitution and state highway funding system during a period of good government reforms in the state.
Career.
McCabe entered government by serving in the 1918 constitutional convention to replace the 1874 Arkansas Constitution. The proposed constitution included women's suffrage, but was not ratified.
Throughout his political career, McCabe fought to increase highway funding for small, rural counties like Baxter County. He introduced bills in 1924 and 1931.
House of Representatives.
During the 48th Arkansas General Assembly, McCabe authored a bill proposing a constitutional convention to reorganize the state government. Proposed during the peak of the good government movement, McCabe's bill echoed many of the retrenchments proposed by Governor Harvey Parnell.
Death.
McCabe was shot in his hotel room early in the morning of March 12, 1931. With a bullet embedded in his heart, McCabe recovered sufficiently to return to Mountain Home, but succumbed to pneumonia at a Little Rock hospital on May 6, 1931. Another hotel guest, H.G. Lansdale, a traveling salesman from Atlanta, Georgia, was charged with murder after a pistol was found in his room. The two men had both complained to a hotel clerk about noise. Lansdale was later acquitted by a jury on June 20.

French submarine Redoutable (1928)

Redoutable was the lead ship of the s of the French Navy launched in 1928 at Cherbourg, France. It participated in the Second World War, first on the side of the Allies from 1939 to 1940, then on the side of the Axis for the rest of the war. She was scuttled by the French on 27 November 1942 to prevent her capture by the Germans during their advance on Toulon, but was then refloated by the Italians in 1943. On 11 March 1944 she was sunk by bombs from Allied aircraft.
Development.
Context.
The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 sought to prevent a future naval arms race by imposing limits on the number and size of certain types of warships that each great power could possess. France sought to expand its submarine forces – which were not limited by the treaty – as an essential tool to defend its coastline and empire. The 1100-ton "Requin"-class submarines, designed in 1922, was the initial attempt to meet these requirements; however, the speed of the submarines was notably insufficient and the design overall was considered inferior to the last German submarines launched in 1918.
The design for the "Requin" class's successor was commissioned from general engineer of maritime engineering Léon Roquebert. Roquebert was tasked with creating a "grand cruiser" type of submarine, with the role of carrying out surveillance of an adversary's bases, destroying their communications by attacking their ships, while protecting French colonies. They were operate with a surface squadron and provide clearance of enemy vessels for it.
Construction of the Type I project submarines, starting with , was approved by the superior council of the navy on 1 July 1924. The building programme was expanded the following year with the Type II submarines.
Characteristics.
 long, with a beam of and a draught of , "Redoutable" could dive up to . The submarine had a surfaced displacement of and a submerged displacement of . Propulsion while surfaced was provided by two diesel motors built by the Swiss manufacturer Sulzer. The submarines' electrical propulsion allowed it to attain speeds of 
 while submerged. Designated as "grand cruise submarines" (), their surfaced range was at , and at , with a submerged range of at . Radio communication was through wireless antenna.
"Redoutable" had significant firepower. She was equipped with eleven torpedo tubes: four tubes in fixed positions in the bow, a orientable platform for three 550 mm tubes behind the conning tower, and another orientable platform on the stern composed of two 550 mm and two tubes. The 550 mm torpedoes were intended for use against large ships, with the 400 mm torpedoes for smaller boats. Torpedoes were propelled by compressed air at a speed of , exploding on impact. Torpedoes left a trail on the surface, which allowed the target to see and avoid the torpedo, as well as trace the torpedo back to its origin. The submarines were also fitted with a deck gun, mounted in front of the conning tower and from 1929, dual anti-aerial machine guns.
"Redoutable" had a quick diving speed, submerging in between 30 and 40 seconds. She had a reputation of handling well while at sea, both at the surface and while diving. Her motors were relatively noisy, as was auxiliary propulsion while submerged, and this constituted the principal criticism of that submarine, despite their reliability. Their speed and powerful armament was balanced against their ability to detect targets, which was essentially by visual sight. She was equipped with three periscopes – an attack periscope, a surveillance periscope, and an auxiliary periscope – and a hydrophone for passive sonar.
History.
Construction.
"Redoutable" was the first of 31 "Redoutable"-class submarines, also designated as the 1500 ton boats because of their displacement. The class entered service between 1931 and 1939.
Ordered in 1924, "Redoutable" was laid down on 1 July 1925 at the Arsenal de Cherbourg. She was launched on 24 February 1928 and was commissioned 10 July 1931. In 1932, she encountered problems with her diving systems and returned to Cherbourg for repairs.
Second World War.
At the start of World War II, she was assigned to the seventh submarine division, based at Cherbourg, along with "Vengeur". From 12 October to 2 November 1939, "Redoutable" carried out a surveillance mission to the Azores, where a part of the German commercial fleet, suspected of supplying German U-boats in fuel, was located. On the night of November 1 she encountered a cargo ship that was sailing all lights off. As the cargo refused to stop in accordance with the submarine's summons, the submarine fired warning shots with its 100 mm cannon, to which the cargo responded by further firing at the submarine. At that moment, "Redoutable" captured a message from the British freighter "Egba" who reported being attacked by a U-boat; The French submarine, understanding that she was attacking an ally, ceased fire and withdrew. In December 1939, he was sent to search for the German supply ship "Altmark" (10 000 barrels) in the centre of the Atlantic with "Fresnel", "Heron" and "Héros".
In June 1940, she was patrolling along the Tunisian coast to prevent a possible Italian landing. She was located in Bizerte when the armistice was signed on 25 June and was placed on guard in Toulon.
On 9 November 1942, the day after the Allied landing in North Africa, "Redoutable" was allowed to rearm. It was not completed when the Germans entered Toulon on 27 November and the submarine scuttled with the French fleet. The ship was refloated on 16 May 1943 to be repaired by the Italians. It was finally sunk by a bombardment on 11 March 1944 with the "Pascal" and "Fresnel".

French submarine Ajax (1930)

Ajax was a of the French Navy launched in 1930 at Brest, France. It participated in the Second World War, first on the side of the Allies from 1939 to 1940 then on the side of the Axis for the rest of the war. On 23 September 1940, during the Battle of Dakar she was badly damaged by depth charges from and was then scuttled.
Construction and Characteristics.
"Ajax" was ordered as part of the French fleet expansion program from in 1926. The project was an improvement of the first post-war French submarines - the Requin type. The design was designed to be especially faster and more maneuverable over the previous class, as well as a larger range and larger weapons storing capacities.
"Ajax" was one of 31 "Redoutable"-class submarines, also designated as the 1500 ton boats because of their displacement. The class entered service between 1931 and 1939.

Second World War.
At the start of World War II, "Ajax" was assigned to the 6th Submarine Division, based in Brest, along with her sister ships "Persée", "Archimède" and "Poncelet". In April 1940, with her sister ship "Archimède", she escorted convoy HX 41 from Halifax to Britain. In front of the advancing German forces, she left Brest along 6:30 pm with thirteen other French submarines and one tanker. The force arrived at Casablanca on 23 June. After the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir, she patrolled along the Moroccan Coast.
On 23 September 1940, she arrived at Dakar with "Persée" and "Poncelet". On the 23rd, she sighted the British force preparing to attack Dakar. She turned to attack it along with "Persée", who was quickly sunk by British depth charges. "Ajax" itself was forced to crash-dive and was then depth charged, but sustained only minor damage. The next day, she attempted to torpedo the battleships and but was detected on sonar and critically damaged by depth charges from the destroyer . She was forced to surface and scuttled by its crew, most of which was then rescued by lifeboats from "Fortune".

German torpedo boat Albatros

Albatros was the fourth of six Type 23 torpedo boats built for the German Navy (initially called the "Reichsmarine" and renamed the "Kriegsmarine" in 1935). Completed in 1927, "Albatros" often served as a flagship of torpedo boat units. The ship made multiple non-intervention patrols during the Spanish Civil War in the late 1930s. After an attack by aircraft of the Spanish Republican Air Force killed German sailors in 1937, she participated in the retaliatory bombardment of Almería.
At the beginning of World War II in 1939, "Albatros" helped to lay minefields and made anti-shipping patrols before participating in Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway in April 1940. The ship fired the first shots of the campaign when she encountered and crippled a Norwegian patrol boat. She was lightly damaged during the Battle of Horten Harbor. "Albatros" then ran aground and was wrecked.→
Design and armament.
Derived from the World War I-era torpedo boat , the Type 23 torpedo boat was slightly larger, but had a similar armament and speed. The Type 23 had an overall length of and was long at the waterline. The ships had a beam of , and a mean draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. The pair of Schichau geared steam turbine sets, each driving one propeller, were designed to produce using steam from three water-tube boilers, which propelled the ship at . "Albatros" carried a maximum of of fuel oil which was intended to give a range of at . The effective range proved to be only at that speed. Their crews consisted of 4 officers and 116 sailors.
As built, the Type 23s mounted three SK L/45 guns, one forward and two aft of the superstructure; the aft superfiring gun was on an open mount while the others were protected by gun shields. They carried six rotating torpedo tubes in two triple mounts amidships and could also carry up to 30 mines. After 1931, the torpedo tubes were replaced by tubes and a pair of C/30 antiaircraft guns were added. At least some of the ships were fitted with depth charges, but details are lacking.
Construction and career.
"Albatros" was laid down at the (Wilhelmshaven Navy Yard) on 5 October 1925 as yard number 105, launched on 15 July 1926 and commissioned on 15 May 1927. After working up, "Albatros" became the flagship of the 4th Torpedo Boat Half-Flotilla, which also consisted of her sister ships , and . The half-flotilla was under the command of "Korvettenkapitän" Karl Dönitz, who later became grand admiral of the "Kriegsmarine" of Nazi Germany.
In the spring of 1929, "Albatros" was departing Wilhelmshaven to take part in a fleet cruise in Spanish waters, and collided with "Möwe" at the exit from the harbor. Both ships followed the fleet four days later after repairs. In 1931, the 4th Torpedo Boat Half-Flotilla and the light cruiser were present during the celebrations of the 10th anniversary of the Latvian Navy in Libau. The following year, "Albatros", again with her sisters and "Königsberg", represented Germany at the celebration of the betrothal of Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten of Sweden, the oldest son of the then crown prince of Sweden, to the German princess Sibylla of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. On 7 December 1932, "Albatros" was decommissioned and replaced by "Greif" as flagship of the 4th Half-Flotilla.
On 5 October 1933, "Albatros", commanded by "Kapitänleutnant" (Lieutenant) Werner Hartmann, was put back into service, replacing the pre-war boat "T151" in the 2nd Torpedo Boat Half-Flotilla based at Swinemünde (now Świnoujście, Poland). "Albatros" became the flagship of the 2nd Half-Flotilla, which consisted of "Möwe" and the two Type 24 torpedo boats and , on 1 October 1934.
Spanish Civil War.
From July 1936 to October 1937, "Albatros" carried out three non-intervention patrols in Spanish waters which were intended to prevent men and material from reaching the participants of the Spanish Civil War. On the first mission from 28 July to 27 August 1936, the four ships of the 2nd Half-Flotilla escorted the light cruiser and the heavy cruisers and to the north Spanish coast where they evacuated Germans and other refugees to France. The warships not only transported refugees, but also escorted the many merchant ships that were chartered by Germany for the repatriation of their citizens. The half-flotilla returned to Spain with "Albatros" from 28 September to 29 November. Her sister ran aground while leaving Cadiz harbor that same month and had to return to Germany on one turbine, escorted by "Albatros".
The 2nd Half-Flotilla returned to Spain for the third time from May to June 1937. On 24 May, Republican aircraft attacked the town and harbor of Palma de Mallorca causing "Deutschland" to depart for Ibiza, although "Albatros"s captain chose to remain in port. During subsequent attacks later that day, several bombs fell near the ship and she steamed to join the cruiser in Ibiza. Five days later, another attack was carried out on "Deutschland" which killed several dozen crewmen. As retaliation, Adolf Hitler ordered "Admiral Scheer" to bombard the Republican-held city of Almería. The four boats of the 2nd Half-Flotilla escorted the ship as she did so on 31 May, targeting Republican coastal artillery, naval buildings and ships in the harbor, which killed 19 people. On 24 June "Albatros" was replaced by "Möwe", and returned to Germany escorting the light cruisers "Köln" and .
Interwar.
In fall 1937, the 2nd Half-Flotilla was disbanded, and "Albatros" served as a training ship until she was decommissioned on 16 February 1938. The boat was placed back into service on 1 July 1938 and was assigned to the 6th Torpedo Boat Flotilla. She was transferred four months later to the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla, which included her sisters "Greif", "Möwe", , and "Falke".
Second World War.
At the start of World War II, "Albatros" was used in the defensive mining operations in the North Sea that began on 3 September 1939 that were intended to prevent the British Royal Navy from entering the German Bight. From 3 to 5 October "Albatros", together with three destroyers and her sisters "Greif" and "Falke", was tasked with anti-shipping patrols in the Kattegat and Skaggerak that captured four ships.
During Operation Weserübung, "Albatros" was assigned to Group 5 under "Konteradmiral" Oskar Kummetz on the heavy cruiser , tasked to capture Oslo. "Albatros" transported about 100 men of the invasion force and was one of the cruiser's escorts through the Baltic and Kattegat. While passing Skagen, Denmark, on 8 April 1940, the British submarine unsuccessfully attacked the cruisers of the group with torpedoes. "Albatros" spotted their tracks and unsuccessfully depth charged the submarine. Later that night the group encountered the Norwegian patrol boat in heavy fog at 23:00. After firing a warning shot and realizing that "Albatros" would not turn away, and was going to violate Norwegian neutrality, "Pol III" fired flares to alert Norwegian coastal batteries and rammed "Albatros" in the side. From "Albatros" it was clear that the guns on "Pol III" were manned, and that the Norwegians intended to fight. Despite clear orders from Kummetz to fire only if fired upon, the torpedo boat's captain, "Kapitänleutnant" Siegfried Strelow, opened fire, hitting "Pol III" with at least two 10.5 cm shells and raking her with machine guns, thus firing the opening shots of the campaign. The Norwegian ship's crew attempted to abandon ship in the only intact boat remaining, but it capsized and they were taken aboard "Albatros". "Albatros"s crew set the patrol boat on fire and abandoned it, proceeding up the foggy Oslofjord independently. The torpedo boat was finally able to get a bearing from her sister "Kondor" and followed her towards the naval base at Karljohansvern, in the town of Horten. En route, she was spotted by the lightly armed Norwegian minesweeper which sheered off after radioing a report at 04:03 on 9 April.
The German force tasked to occupy Karljohansvern was scheduled to do so at dawn on 9 April, but "Kondor"s captain, the commander of the force, decided to assault the harbor directly since the Norwegians had already been alerted. About 140 soldiers were transferred to the small motor minesweepers "R17" and "R21" and the former was in the lead as they steamed through the harbor entrance at 04:35 at high speed, slowly followed by "Albatros", while "Kondor" was transferring her embarked troops to another ship. The minelayer engaged "R17" ten minutes later and set her on fire, but not before she unloaded her troops. The minelayer was only able to get a few shots off at "R21" before she steamed behind an island in the harbor. About this time, "Albatros" was approaching the harbor mouth and exchanged fire with "Olav Tryggvason" without effect. Strelow, with only a single gun able to bear on the minelayer, withdrew behind one of the outer islands and started blindly bombarding the harbor. The minelayer was occasionally struck by shrapnel, but she hit the torpedo boat with one shell at 06:30, killing two and wounding another pair of sailors. "Albatros" withdrew not long afterward and the German troops that had made it ashore bluffed the Norwegians into surrendering at 07:35.
Later that morning, "Kondor" and "Albatros" were ordered to land their troops at Son and then, reinforced by "R21", she was ordered to secure the submarine base at Teie. On the morning of 10 April, "Kondor" and "Albatros" were engaged by coastal batteries on the island of Bolærne and forced to turn away. Later that day, "Albatros" was escorting the merchant ship while also landing men on the island of Rauøy; Strelow decided to steam east of the island to avoid any further attention from the guns on Bolærne. Unbeknownst to him, sea ice had removed the marker for the Gyren shoal a few weeks earlier and "Albatros" struck it at a speed of . The impact ripped open at least one fuel tank and holed the turbine and boiler rooms. The ship settled with a pronounced list to port and her stern in the air. She quickly lost all electrical power and several fires were ignited that caused several small explosions; "Albatros" was declared a total loss. The crew were rescued by the "Vorpostenboot" and was later assigned to after the Norwegian surrender. The minelayer was initially renamed "Albatros II" and then became "Brummer".

Tala'i ibn Ruzzik

Tala'i ibn Ruzzik (, with his full titles and surnames "Abū'l-Gharāt Fāris al-Muslimīn al-Malik al-Ṣāliḥ Ṭalāʾīʿ ibn Ruzzīk al-Ghassānī al-Armanī") was a military commander and official of the Fatimid Caliphate, serving as its vizier from 1154 until his assassination in 1161, when he was succeeded by his son, Ruzzik ibn Tala'i. He is generally acknowledged as the last of the powerful and capable viziers of the Fatimid state. During his tenure the Fatimid Caliphate regained a measure of stability, and was once again able to project its power abroad and pursue its political interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Early life and career.
Although his "nisbah" of "al-Ghassānī" implies an origin form the Arab tribe of the Ghassanids, and one source claims that he was an Armenian, most authors consider Tala'i ibn Ruzzik an Armenian (whence the surname "al-Armanī"), and indicate that his father was among those Armenians who came to Egypt under the rule of the powerful Armenian vizier Badr al-Jamali and his son al-Afdal Shahanshah. Indeed, some writers thought that he was born in Armenia. Born at the beginning of the 12th century, at first Ibn Ruzzik appears to have pursued a career in Iraq, where he also converted to Twelver Shi'ism, as evidenced by the correspondence he maintained thereafter with Mosul, Kufa, and Hillah.
At an unknown point, he joined the Fatimid army. His career there is unknown, but by 1143/4 he was governor of al-Buhayra, when he subdued a rebellion of the Lawata Berbers. Later he participated in the revolt of al-Adil ibn al-Sallar and his stepson Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh against the vizier Ibn Masal (winter 1149/50), winning an important victory for the rebels. He then held the governorships of Aswan and of Qus (the capital of Upper Egypt). By 1154, he was governor of either Asyut in Upper Egypt, Ashmunayn and al-Bahnasa, or of Munyat Bani al-Khasib. In April of that year, Abbas ibn Abi al-Futuh and his son Nasr, who had already assassinated Ibn al-Sallar, murdered Caliph al-Zafir. Abbas placed the five-year-old al-Fa'iz on the throne and executed two of al-Zafir's brothers, whom he accused of responsibility for al-Zafir's assassination. Thereupon the women of the palace, led by al-Zafir's sister Sitt al-Qusur, reportedly cut off their hair and sent it to Ibn Ruzzik, requesting of him to save the dynasty. Ibn Ruzzik mobilized his forces—the holders of the "iqṭāʿ" fiefs and allied Arab and Berber tribes—and marched on Cairo, where Abbas' attempts to organize resistance foundered on popular opposition to his regime. As Ibn Ruzzik appeared before the city, Abbas, his son, and their chief supporters escaped the city towards Syria. Sitt al-Qusur sent word of their escape to the Crusaders of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, however, and Abbas was killed, while Nasr was taken captive and sent back to Egypt, where he was executed by the women of the palace. The treasure of the palace, however, which Abbas had loaded on a train of 600 mules and camels and taken with him, was kept by the Crusaders.
Vizierate.
Domestic policies.
Thus, in July 1154, Ibn Ruzzik entered Cairo in triumph. The symbols he chose during his entry carried ominous overtones for the future of the Fatimid dynasty: eschewing Fatimid white, both the standards of his army, and Ibn Ruzzik's own clothes, were black, the colour of the Fatimids' arch-rivals, the Abbasids. He then installed himself in the Dar al-Ma'mun palace, and began a purge of the officials and their families who had collaborated with Abbas. Those found guilty were executed or sent to exile, while a few managed to escape to Yemen. This left Ibn Ruzzik, now vizier, as the undisputed ruler of the country; the underage Caliph al-Fa'iz was reduced to a mere figurehead and lived under virtual house arrest. He was the first Fatimid vizier to assume the honorific "laqab" of "al-Malik" ("king"); according to Thierry Bianquis, this was probably in imitation of the earlier Buyid dynasty, who were likewise Imamis and who exercised a similar role as the guardians of, and "de facto" rulers instead of, the Abbasid caliphs. However, it was also a title used by the other great contemporary Muslim ruler, Nur al-Din Zengi of Syria.
Himself well educated in high Arabic culture and a capable poet, Ibn Ruzzik liked to surround himself with scholars, among whom the most notable were the "qāḍī" al-Muhadhdhab al-Hasan ibn Ali ibn al-Zubayr (from Aswan), and the "kātib" al-Jalis al-Makin ibn al-Hubab, who directed the chancery ("dīwān al-inshāʾ"). Abbas' flight with the state treasure left a problematic financial situation, but Ibn Ruzzik proved an energetic and capable administrator, who paid close attention to financial matters: he not only balanced the economy, but also amassed a huge personal property through confiscations and speculation in cereals. Much of his personal wealth was used to endow pious establishments, including the large Husayn Mosque outside the Bab Zuwayla gate, intended to house a precious relic, the head of Husayn ibn Ali. This was the last major monument built under the Fatimids in Cairo, and was fortified according to the style of Upper Egypt.
Having served long in Upper Egypt, Ibn Ruzzik maintained close ties to it; upon becoming vizier, he financed the reconstruction of the main mosque at Qus. The area now became his main powerbase: a wealthy region which controlled access to the interior of the African continent, as well as the commerce routes linking Egypt with Arabia—including the symbolically important "hajj" routes and the wheat supply for Mecca and Medina— and the Indian Ocean. The support of the governor of Qus, Nasir al-Dawla Yaqut, was important in suppressing the rebellion of the governor of Damietta, al-Ahwad ibn Tamim in 1156, but Yaqut himself plotted an uprising in 1157, in consultation with one of the Caliphs aunts, who resented Ibn Ruzzik's interference in palace affairs. Yaqut was arrested in Cairo and replaced with Izz al-Din Tarkhan, followed by Shawar, one of Ibn Ruzzik's pages (and future vizier).
Conflict with the Crusaders.
In spring 1154, a Crusader fleet from the Kingdom of Sicily raided the port city of Tinnis with devastating effect. Newly come to power in Cairo, Ibn Ruzzik initially sought to placate the Crusaders by paying them tribute in exchange for a truce. To this end, he planned to raise new taxes on the "iqṭāʿ" fiefs of his officers. The latter were opposed to the idea, and instead launched a raid of their own against the Crusader port of Tyre. The operation, bold and unorthodox, was successful, and scuppered Ibn Ruzzik's plans.
In April 1154, Nur al-Din Zengi, the Muslim ruler of northern Syria, succeeded in capturing Damascus. Encouraged by this event, Ibn Ruzzik abandoned his negotiations with the Crusaders and renewed efforts to form a league between Egypt and Nur al-Din, which had already been attempted by Ibn al-Sallar in 1150. In 1158, Ibn Ruzzik sent the "ḥādjib" Mahmud al-Muwallad to Nur al-Din, proposing an alliance and joint operations against the Crusader principalities, while an army under Dirgham, the deputy chamberlain of the palace ("nāʾib al-Bāb"), was dispatched to raid into Palestine. The army scored some successes at Gaza and raided in Palestine up to beyond the Jordan River, while the Fatimid fleet raided against Beirut. These victories emboldened Ibn Ruzzik, who wrote of them to Nur al-Din, exhorting him to join with Egypt in holy war against the Crusaders. He also tried to enlist Usama ibn Munqidh, a former Fatimid official who had gained Nur al-Din's favour, in support of this cause, but in vain: Usama refused to take sides, and al-Muwallad's embassy failed.
These operations were judged as ineffective both by Arab chroniclers and modern historians, while the reasons behind Nur al-Din's passivity have been debated. Nevertheless, these operations forced the other powers of the eastern Mediterranean to once again take account of Fatimid power. In the aftermath of the raid, a mission from the Byzantine Empire arrived at Cairo, asking for assistance against the Kingdom of Sicily. In reply, the brother of the ruler of Cyprus, who had been taken prisoner, was sent to the Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos. Soon after, envoys from the Crusader realms arrived to arrange a truce, while the Byzantines restored their relations with Nur al-Din. At the same time, Ibn Ruzzik tok care to fortify the city of Bilbays, north of Cairo, to block any army invading the country from the north.
Death and succession.
On 23 July 1160, Caliph al-Fa'iz died of illness. Ibn Ruzzik at first considered raising an adult member of the Fatimid clan to the caliphate, but in the end settled on the nine-year-old al-Adid, whose father was one of the brothers of al-Zafir executed by Abbas on the very day al-Fa'iz had been raised to the throne. With a minor once again on the throne, Ibn Ruzzik's position was secure, and was strengthened further when he forced the young caliph to marry his daughter.
However, these moves, coupled with Ibn Ruzzik's patronage of Twelver Shi'ism, alarmed the royal family. Sitt al-Qusur paid black soldiers, who attacked Ibn Ruzzik on 10 September 1161 in the hallway of his palace. Mortally wounded, Ibn Ruzzik nevertheless survived long enough to secure from the Caliph the recognition of his son, Ruzzik ibn Tala'i, as his successor, as well as the death of Sitt al-Qusur and the three men who had attacked him. On his deathbed, he reportedly confided to his son his three regrets: the construction of the Husayn Mosque outside the walls, which could be used to attack Cairo; that he did not have the opportunity to use Bilbays as a base against the Crusaders, despite the expenses lavished on it; and having put Shawar ibn Mujir al-Sa'di in the powerful position of governor of Upper Egypt, from where he now posed a threat to his own power. His premonition proved true: in 1162, Shawar chased Ibn Tala'i from Cairo, and became the "de facto" ruler of Egypt. In 1174, one of his descendants took part in an abortive large-scale conspiracy to overthrow Saladin and restore the Fatimids, who had been deposed three years previously, to power.
Assessment.
Muslim chroniclers were divided in their assessment of Ibn Ruzzik: the Egyptian historian Ibn Zafir focused on his violent behaviour and greed, but the 13th-century polymath Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi considered him among the most successful Fatimid viziers, along the likes of Ibn Killis or al-Afdal Shahanshah. This assessment is largely shared by modern historians; Thierry Bianquis describes him as "the last great man of the Fāṭimid state, who wanted to reconstruct a strong Egypt, which could carry out its own foreign policies".

Charles Dunham

Charles A. Dunham (18321900) was a spy, forger, and American Civil War journalist. Dunham had at least twelve identities, and is best known for testimony claiming Abraham Lincoln's assassination was ordered by the Confederacy. He wrote for the "New York World", "New York Herald", and "New-York Tribune" simultaneously. At one time, he wrote an article for the "Herald," a rebuttal of the article in the "Tribune." Dunham claimed to have spied on both sides in the Civil War, and, in an attempt to defraud the government, claimed to have raised a legion called the Cameron Guards. Dunham was a lawyer before the outbreak of the Civil War, and claimed to have been conscripted into the Confederate army, where he eventually escaped to the North.

Memoirs of a Revolutionist

Memoirs of a Revolutionist is Peter Kropotkin's autobiography and his most famous work.
Summary.
Kropotkin's "Memoirs" address the arc of his life, the development of his anarchist philosophy, and his activism for socialist causes. It covers his childhood, cadet corps schooling, geographical work, political awakening, international travel, and Chaykovsky Circle work. He discusses his exile and activism in Western Europe after escaping from a Russian jail.
Publication history.
Elements of what would become Kropotkin's "Memoirs of a Revolutionist" were first published in "The Atlantic Monthly" between 1898 and 1899 in English, the same year it received its first publication from Houghton Mifflin with an introduction by Georg Brandes. Later editions of this original 1899 release include those edited and introduced by James Allen Rodgers (Doubleday, 1962) and Nicolas Walter (Dover Publications, 1971). Both use endnotes to address Kropotkin's subsequent Russian-language additions in the translation of his "Memoirs".
After its initial release, Kropotkin continued to revise his "Memoirs" with Russian-language additions in a translation of the 1902 English release. These were published in multiple editions between 1906 and 1929. The canonical 1933 Soviet Academia edition derived from Kropotkin's Russian manuscript and became the basis for Soviet reprints.
A reviewer of the English editions in "The Slavonic and East European Review" remarked that the memoirs remained readable and interesting in the present day. While he praised the editors' extensive notes and sufficient indices, he felt that ready footnotes would have been more appropriate than endnotes for putting Kropotkin's additions in context, and that the 1933 Russian edition's illustrations would have been worthwhile imports.

Deerfoot-Bad Meat

Deerfoot-Bad Meat or Api-kai-ees meaning "scabby dried meat" or "bad meat" (born in 1864 in Siksika territory. Died in 1897 Calgary, Alberta District, North-West Territories). He was a Siksika runner from Western Canada whose most noted achievement was winning the 1886 Calgary Star-Rink Endurance Race.
Biography.
Deerfoot-Bad Meat was born on traditional Blackfoot territory (now the Blackfoot Indian Reserve) on the Western Canadian plains. He was the son of Nato-West-Sitsi (Medicine Fire) and nephew of Big Chief Crowfoot. Deerfoot-Bad Meat followed the Blackfoot tradition at the time of having several wives and several children; he died on February 24, 1897 in Calgary.
Career as a runner.
By 1880, Deerfoot-Bad Meat had become an exceptional long-distance runner working as a messenger for the Blackfoot Confederacy running between camps in the North-West Territories and the Montana Territory.
Deerfoot-Bad Meat first began running in minor local races when he was discovered by a Calgary gambling group called The Syndicate. The group was interested in finding local runners who could compete with continental champions for gambling money. Around the same time the indoor track "Star-Rink" was being built in Calgary which would serve as a venue for these championship foot-races. In 1883, in one of his first professional races, Deerfoot-Bad Meat defeated professional runner James Green and Blackfoot runner Little Plume in a four-day endurance race. In 16 hours, he completed and 6 laps. Following this, Api-kai-ees was officially given the professional name Deerfoot, after the original Seneca runner Deerfoot-Red Jacket.
Deerfoot-Bad Meat continued to run successfully in many more local races in the Calgary area and beyond, defeating challengers from as far away as Europe. In 1886 he won the prestigious Dominion Day race, coming within a second of breaking the world record for that distance.
Later that autumn, in order to showcase Canadian talent to the world, multiple gambling groups decided to organize a major race in Calgary. Deerfoot-Bad Meat was entered to run against the favourite J.W. Strokes of Birmingham, England, and George Irvine of Winnipeg, Manitoba. In what was considered the race of the decade, Deerfoot-Bad Meat overwhelmingly defeated Stokes and Irvine, beating the Englishman by a full lap. Not happy with what the Europeans considered a "humilliating" defeat, the handlers of the British runner claimed a miscount of laps and the race was invalidated. The organizers rescheduled a new race for several days later. Nevertheless, being already suspicious of the British team, Deerfoot-Bad Meat stepped onto the race track only after giving Stokes a six-lap head-start in order to dispel any possibility of another miscount. Deerfoot nevertheless passed the Birmingham racer and finished the ten miles in 54 minutes 30 seconds.
Later career and death.
Disillusioned and disappointed with the corruption involving the gambling group The Syndicate, Deerfoot parted ways with his team in 1886 and began running as an independent with mixed success. Deerfoot died in 1897 of tuberculosis and is buried in an unmarked grave in Calgary.
In 1974 the City of Calgary renamed a major freeway, Deerfoot Trail, as well as an industrial centre and shopping venue (Deerfoot City) in his honour.

Pohjanmaa-class corvette

The "Pohjanmaa" class is a series of four multi-role corvettes currently under development for the Finnish Navy as part of the Squadron 2020 () project. Together with the existing four s, the four new surface combatants will form the backbone of the Finnish Navy from the mid-2020s onwards. They will replace seven older vessels that have been or are due to be decommissioned: the minelayer , two s and four s.
Design.
General characteristics.
The overall length of the "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be about and the beam about . The maximum draught of the vessels will be about which corresponds to a displacement of about . With these main dimensions, the new multi-role corvettes will be the largest Finnish surface combatants since the 1930s coastal defence ships and . Each ship will have a complement of about 70 officers and crew. Designed for year-round service in the seasonally freezing Baltic Sea, "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will feature an ice-strengthened hull and ability to operate independently in ice. Although no Finnish-Swedish ice class exists for military vessels, the ice capacity of the corvettes will be equivalent to that ice class 1A for merchant ships.
The "Pohjanmaa" class will feature a combined diesel-electric and gas (CODLAG) propulsion system with a total output of about . During normal patrol operations, the ship's twin ice-strengthened controllable pitch propellers are driven by electric propulsion motors. However, two of the four 12-cylinder MAN 12V175D type diesel generating sets are installed on double resilient mountings within soundproof enclosures to reduce noise and vibration during anti-submarine warfare (ASW) missions. When higher speeds are required, a single General Electric LM2500 gas turbine driving both propeller shafts via a common gearbox can be used to achieve speeds in excess of . For low-speed maneuvering, the ships are fitted with two bow thrusters.
Combat management system, Communication system and sensors.
The combat management system (CMS) of the "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be provided by the Swedish defence company Saab. The integrated communication system (ICS) TactiCall is provided by Saab. Built around the 9LV CMS, the system will include Sea Giraffe 4A FF fixed-face AESA and Sea Giraffe 1X short-range 3D radars installed on a Saab Lightweight Integrated Mast (SLIM), two CEROS 200 fire control directors, TactiCall integrated communications system, and a laser warning system. Before final selection, the Finnish Navy shortlisted Saab together with Lockheed Martin Canada and Atlas Elektronik as the potential combat management system provider and integrator.
The underwater sensor suite will consist of Kongsberg's SS2030 active hull-mounted sonar and SD9500 lightweight over-the-side dipping sonar. In addition, "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be equipped with Patria's lightweight dual-tow Sonac DTS that includes both an active variable-depth sonar as well as a passive towed receiving array.
Armament.
"Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be armed with a single dual-purpose naval gun, surface-to-surface and surface-to-air missiles, anti-submarine torpedoes, naval mines, close-in weapon systems, and a decoy system.
The forward-mounted Bofors 57 mm Mk3 dual-purpose main gun will be recycled from the s. In addition, each "Pohjanmaa"-class corvette will be fitted with two Saab Trackfire remote controlled weapon stations for close-in self-defence and four Rheinmetall Multi Ammunition Softkill System (MASS) decoy launchers.
The primary surface-to-surface armament of the "Pohjanmaa" class is the Gabriel 5 subsonic anti-ship missile. The latest version of Israel Aerospace Industries's anti-ship missile family was selected over Kongsberg's Naval Strike Missile, MBDA's Exocet, Boeing's Harpoon and Saab's RBS15. In Finnish Navy service, the missile system will be referred to as PTO2020 ("Pintatorjuntaohjus 2020", "surface defence missile").
Against aerial targets, "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be armed with Raytheon RIM-162 Evolved Seasparrow Missile (ESSM) surface-to-air missiles. Each vessel will be capable of carrying a total of 32 missiles quad-packed to eight Mark 41 Vertical Launching System silos. In Finnish Navy service, the system will be referred to as ITO20 ("Ilmatorjuntaohjus 20").
For underwater warfare, the vessels will be fitted with Saab Torped 47 lightweight anti-submarine torpedoes. In addition, "Pohjanmaa"-class corvettes will be able to lay naval mines.
Development and construction.
The initial development of the new surface combatants for the Finnish Navy began with a research and planning phase in 2008 and the Squadron 2020 project was officially launched in 2015. The 647.6 million euro shipbuilding contract was awarded to the Finnish shipbuilder Rauma Marine Constructions in September 2019. The construction of the four-strong class will be staggered over 2022–2025 and full operational status is achieved in 2028.
Naming.
One of the Finnish Navy's traditions has been to name its major combat ships after regions in Finland. The name "Pohjanmaa", which is the Finnish name for the region Ostrobothnia, has been used both by the Finnish and Swedish navies for previous ships and classes of ships, dating back to the 18th century with the first recorded vessel being "Gamla Pojama" "("Old Pohjanmaa")", that was launched in 1760, and the last one, being the minelayer/training vessel , which was sold in 2016. The aforementioned 18th century Pohjanmaa, alongside the Hämeenmaa, Uusimaa and Turunmaa types were also the four main "archipelago frigate" types used in the 1790 Battle of Svensksund, which is one of the largest Finnish (Finland was a part of Sweden at the time) naval victories and the largest naval battle in the Baltic Sea to date.
Criticism.
Corvette or frigate?
While the Finnish Navy and the Ministry of Defence refer to the new surface combatants as multi-role corvettes, several commentators have pointed out that by displacement the vessels should be classified as frigates. In late September 2019, shortly after the construction contract was awarded, MP Johannes Yrttiaho (Left Alliance) submitted a written question to the Parliament of Finland about, among other related topics, the classification of the new ships.
In the official blog of the Finnish Defence Forces, Flotilla admiral Jori Harju (Commander of the Finnish Navy) noted that one of the reasons leading to the increased displacement is the additional strengthening of the hull, propulsion shaft lines and propellers required for year-round operation in the seasonally freezing Finnish territorial waters. He also pointed out that the "Pohjanmaa" class is intended to operate primarily in coastal waters whereas frigates are traditionally considered as the smallest class of warships operating in the high seas as part of a so-called blue-water navy.
Too large for Finland?
Since the early 2000s, Finnish Navy's surface combatant fleet has consisted mainly of fast attack craft with displacements of . Until the planned commission of the new "Pohjanmaa" class, the largest surface combatants of the Finnish Navy remain the two s. Several commentators have criticized the Squadron 2020 program due to the size of the new corvettes: according to critics, the ships are too large for the often shallow Finnish territorial waters riddled with skerries as well as too attractive and large targets for Russian anti-ship missiles. Furthermore, it has been speculated that the ship size has been driven by their suitability for international missions rather than domestic defence needs and that the whole concept has been derived from the s operated by the United States Navy.
The Finnish Navy has argued that the size of the new ships is a result of combining multiple missions within a single hull. In particular, the ability to lay naval mines has been raised as one of the key features necessitating a larger vessel. Despite some similarities in external appearance to other naval ships, the new multi-role corvettes have been tailored for the Finnish Navy's missions in the Baltic Sea and thus represent a completely new vessel concept with no reference design in service anywhere in the world.

AS Franz Krull

AS Franz Krull (; ) was a metal works and engineering company in Tallinn, Estonia. It was founded by German industrialist Franz Krull in 1865 in Narva and in 1875 it was moved to Tallinn. The company manufactured different products, including steam locomotives, equipment for power plants and oil shale industry, and agricultural machinery. During the Soviet occupation the company was nationalized and it became one of the largest contractors for the Soviet gas industry.
History.
The company was founded on 25 April 1865 when German brazier Franz Joachim Heinrich Krull rented from the city of Narva a coppersmith workshop, which was belonged to deceased Friedrich Ludwig Büll. The main product of the newly established company became distillation apparatuses. In 1870 it introduced the new type of distillation apparatus which had higher efficiency and quality than other models of that time. That business created enough revenue to bought out the workshop.
In 1875, Franz Krull sold the workshop in Narva and moved the industry to Tallinn. In 1895, Franz Krull sons Franz Krull II and Gerhard Krull took over the management of the company. In 1899, the industry moved to the Kalamaja district in Tallinn. The company also produced boilers, e.g. for the Tallinn Power Plant and locomotives, cisterns and tanks, filters and pumps, transmissions and gears, equipment for lumber mills and copper smithies, and various cast iron products. Production of the distillery equipment decreased but continued to be a part of the production portfolio. Before World War I AS Franz Krull received a number of contracts from the Russian military sector, particularly from three shipyards in Tallinn which were established in 1912–1913. As a result, the company had 400 employees in 1913. The company started to manufacture also high-capacity refrigeration and ice-making equipment.
When World War I started, Gerhard Krull was in Germany and cannot return to Estonia. As German national he was afraid of confiscation of the company. To avoid this, the ownership was transferred to his brother-in-law, who immediately sold the company to the Azov–Don Commercial Bank and fled with money. Franz Krull II continued as a director of the company until his death in 1917. During the war the company manufactured water desalination systems for cruisers, cooling systems and boilers for cargo ships, and various machines and equipment for fortresses.
In the beginning of the independence of Estonia, AS Franz Krull was taken over by German financiers. Later it was listed at the Tallinn stock exchange. The company manufactured mainly cast iron consumer goods. In 1927, it started to manufacture equipment for the oil shale industry. Between 1927 and 1938, it manufactured four tunnel oven for the oil shale company Eesti Kiviõli. In 1938, the Glen Davis Shale Oil Works in Australia planned to order two tunnel ovens from AS Franz Krull; however, due to time and budget constraints the deal was not finalized. In 1931, AS Franz Krull manufactured its first steam locomotive. The company continued to manufacture refrigeration equipment, which in addition to the Estonian market was exported to Lithuania, but occasionally also to India, Iran, the United Kingdom, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Bulgaria. The company produced also road construction machinery, peat industry machinery, agricultural machinery, and boilers.
After start of the Soviet occupation the company was nationalized and renamed Punane Krull (meaning Red Krull). After start of the World War II, the equipment of the metal works and employees were transferred to Russia to avoid capture by German forces. During the German occupation the metal works continued to work in Tallinn under German administration.
After restoration of the Soviet rule in Estonia, the company was renamed Plant No. 9 of the Main Department of Synthetic Liquid Fuel and Gas () in 1945. The plant specialized in the production of equipment for the oil shale and natural gas industry, as well as lifting equipment. In 1949, it was renamed Tallinn Machinery Plant (). The plant production included large-scale ventilators, centrifugal pumps, high-power steam boilers, conveyors, and elevators. Its drilling rigs were used in addition to the Soviet Union also in Albania, Romania, China and several Arab countries.
In 1955, the plant was placed under the USSR Oil and Gas Industry Construction Ministry, which focused on the construction of construction machinery. In 1963, the plant started manufacturing air-cooled heat exchangers. In 1971, the plant was named after the communist politician Johannes Lauristin.
After Estonia regained independence, the plant was privatized in 1993. As of 2018, it is named OÜ Tallinna Masinatehas and it concentrated on production of heat exchangers.

Léonie d'Aunet

Léonie Thévenot d'Aunet (2 July 1820 – 3 March 1879) was a French author, novelist, playwright and Arctic explorer.
Biography.
D'Aunet was born to Auguste-François-Michel Thévenot d'Aunet an officer of a military squadron from Québec, and d'Henriette-Joséphine d'Orémieulx. She was educated at the . She married the painter François-Auguste Biard (1798–1882) on 23 July 1840 in Paris.
In 1838 the corvette "La Recherche" (1838–1839), under the command of Joseph Paul Gaimard, undertook a scientific expedition to Spitzbergen, to explore the Arctic. D'Aunet was by this time living with Biard, and agreed to persuade her future husband to accept the position of official painter for the expedition, on condition that she be allowed to accompany him. She traveled with Biard across Belgium, Holland and Norway, before leaving Hammerfest, the northernmost city in Scandinavia, and returned after spending several weeks at Spitzbergen. She was the first woman to participate in a scientific expedition to the northern regions, On return, her letters were published, in serial form, in "Revue de Paris".
In autumn 1843 she became acquainted with Victor Hugo, whom she most likely met at the salon of . Their relationship eased Hugo's life, inspiring him to the numerous poems of which one finds trace in "Les Contemplations". Her seven year liaison was interrupted by Victor Hugo's exile after the coup d'état by Napoleon III on December 2, 1851.
On Monday April 1844, their relations became public knowledge, when on July 5, 1845, she was surprised with the writer in the act of adultery in a hotel on the . The commissioner let Hugo leave after hesitating, when Hugo invoked his inviolability as a peer of France, but Leonie was arrested and taken to the prison at Saint-Lazare.
After two months, she was transferred to the Convent of the Ladies of Saint Michael, where Adèle Foucher (wife of Victor Hugo), who was glad to see a competitor to Juliette Drouet, decided to visit Leonie. In the meanwhile Louis-Philippe I awarded a commission to her husband to appease him.
Literary career.
On September 10, 1845, she entered the convent of the Augustines, where she remained for about six months. Once released, she made frequent visits to Hugo's home. Adèle Hugo helped her, in exchange for clothing advice and interior decoration, to launch her literary career. Some even affirmed that most of her books were due to Victor Hugo When Hugo left for exile, Adèle dissuaded her from joining him, but their correspondence did not cease. He, feeling responsible for the children of Leonie, upon his return from exile, regularly sent her money until his death.
She entered into the literary career under her maiden name, after her legal separation from her husband in 1855. She began by publishing, as a book with Hachette, the account of her journey to Spitzbergen under the title of "Voyage d'une femme au Spitzberg". This work was followed by the "Un Mariage en province" (1856), published in "La Presse"; "The Vengeance" (1857), "Étiennette", "Silvère", "The Secret" (1859), "The Heritage of the Marquis d'Elsigny" for the Library of the Railways from Hachette Publishers, and which earned her a distinguished place in the world of letters.
Playwright.
D'Aunet also devoted herself to the theater by writing the drama "Jane Osborn", performed by Lucie Mabire, on 30 January 1856 at the Porte de Saint-Martin theatre. She also published serials in "Le Siècle", "Le Courrier de Paris", "Le Journal pour tous", and "", and held the fashion column at the magazine "Les Modes parisiennes" under the pseudonym "Thérèse de Blaru".
Family.
She left a son, known as Biard d'Aunet, who married Miss de Lestang-Parade. She also had a daughter, , who died in 1897, who bore in literature the pseudonym ("Sparkle") and who successively married Viscount Peyronny and Baron Double de Saint-Lambert.

Extrusion welding

Extrusion welding is one of the processes used to weld thermoplastics and composites, developed in the 1960s as an evolution of hot gas welding. It can be a manual or automated process.
The process uses a welding head that has a nozzle for hot air and an extruder that pushes filler material out. The process entails heating of the joining (faying) surfaces by means of heat of and addition of molten or plasticized filler material (extrudate) being extruded through a die (shoe). The extrudate is applied with pressure to ensure good bonding, and then the part is allowed to cool.
Welding steps.
The steps of this welding process are similar to other plastic welding processes and involve:
Preheat is required at the initial start of the weld. This is typically achieved by using the hot air nozzle on the welding gun and fanning the starting area. Once welding has commenced, proper travel speed and gun angle will ensure that the upcoming faying surface has been sufficiently preheated.
The filler material is a polymer that comes in the form of spooled strands or in pellets.
Joint configuration.
Most weld joints are designed to be a single pass, but plates over 30 mm thickness will require multiple passes. Because most passes are designed to be done in a single pass, extrusion welding typically takes less overall time to perform as compared to other plastic welding processes, particularly its predecessor, hot gas welding.
Joint design include:
Butt joints will be single-V or double-V groove with 45-90° and 0-2 mm root gap. If welding a double-V groove, welding will need to be performed in a minimum of two passes.
T-joints will normally have a single bevel of 45-60° and 0-2 mm root gap.
Both TYK connections for piping and fillet welds are achievable as well.
Applications.
Extrusion welding is an attractive process for applications that take advantage of its ability to weld thick sections quickly. For some applications, especially where there are large geometry parts where more traditional plastic welding methods (such as hot plate welding) is not possible, extrusion welding is the only feasible and cost effect option. In particular, tanks for liquid waste, corrosive materials, water supply are common applications. As long as a sealing bond is achieved, extrusion welding can be used for waterproofing applications as well.
Materials.
Extrusion welding has seen the most success in welding different types of polyolefins.
Common materials welded with this process are:
Equipment.
While there are various forms of extrusion welding equipment, there are three main components that every extrusion welding setup contains:
Extruder.
The extruder is the part of the setup that actually feeds extrudate through the system. The setup of the extruder depends on if the extrudate is in pellet or in spooled strand form. When spooled strands are used, the spool is fed through a tube into the welding head and then exits through the shoe. When pellets are used for extrudate, the pellets are fed into a hopper, then a heated spiral extruder forces them through the welding head and out through the shoe as molten filler material. Pellets can only be used when welding is being performed in the flat or horizontal position.
Radiant heat source.
For most applications, the radiant heat source will be hot air. The air is heated and blown through a nozzle that is part of the weld head setup. Different nozzle geometries are available, and the welder may select a certain nozzle depending on the joint configuration. Although there is a general purpose nozzle, certain nozzles ensure more thorough or more focused heating of a given joint type. Although hot air is usually used as the means for preheat, halogen lamps are sometimes used as the means for preheating the faying surface.
Welding shoe.
The welding shoe is the die at the end of the feed through which the filler material is being extruded. Typically, the shoe is made out of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) because of PTFE's non-stick properties. Welding shoes come in various shapes and sizes depending on the joint design that is being welded. The welding shoe will also have guide nipples that prevent the molten extrudate from flowing in an undesired direction.
Welding parameters.
There are several main welding parameters, and each of them have a different bearing on the welding process. Some are dependent on the welder, whereas others can be set on the machine before welding commences. Getting a good balance of each parameter is the key to achieving strong and aesthetic welds. Automation or skill by an experienced welder, coupled with properly set parameters will result in consistent and reproducible welds.
Welding speed.
Welding speed or travel speed, is the rate at which the weld is traversing down the weld joint. For an automated system, the welding speed can be set before the machine starts to go. With a manual setup, the travel speed will depend on the welder. If the travel speed is too fast, there won't be enough filler material deposited, resulting in a small weld bead. Traveling too quickly may also not provide enough time to get sufficient heat to the faying surfaces. This will result in poor adhesion of the extrudate to the faying surface. This poor adhesion leads to poor strength of the welded part. Conversely, if the travel speed is too low, then too much filler material will be deposited, resulting in an unaesthetic weld and potentially flash formation which will then need to be removed.
Position of the welding head.
Position of the welding gun is essential to ensure that the extrudate is being deposited in the right area. When a manual system is being used, the welder will need to ensure that the welding head is aimed correctly. If there is misalignment between the gun and the joint, the material will not be deposited to the correct area. To help guide the welder, the weld shoe will be specifically shaped for a given joint geometry so that the position is maintained throughout welding.
Temperature of the extrudate.
The temperature of the extrudate will be set on the extruder before welding begins. The temperature must be high enough such that the extrudate will be sufficiently fluid to flow, but not so high that the polymer filler material will begin to chemically breakdown. The ideal temperature for the extrudate will be dependent on what polymer being used.
Airflow rate and air temperature.
Studies by have found that airflow rate and temperature are the two biggest factors in the development of creep strength of the welded parts. This is because airflow rate and air temperature are the two biggest factors in development of a melt layer prior to welding. The melt layer is the layer of molten polymer on top of the faying surface. When the melt layer reaches an ideal thickness for welding, the creep strength of the welds increase dramatically. Like with the temperature of the extrudate however, the ideal temperature and airflow rate for base material will depend on what polymer is being welded. Additionally, airflow may be altered depending on the shape of the nozzle.
Extrusion rate.
Extrusion rate is how much extrudate is actually being transferred into the joint at any given time. Along with extrudate temperature and airflow rate/temperature, extrusion rate must be balanced in order to achieve ideal weld properties. If not enough material is added, then there won't be complete fusion of the joint. Conversely, if too much filler is added, then there is potential to create flash or sharp point at the toes of the weld cap. These would act as stress risers and dramatically decrease the strength of the weld both in dynamic and fatigue loading.
Advantages and disadvantages.
Advantages.
The main advantage of extrusion welding is that it can achieve very high deposition rates of filler material into a joint, thus cutting down on cycle time. As compared to hot gas welding, which is a polymer welding process that could have many of the same applications, the time to completion for a weld is as much as 5-6x faster.
With proper parameters, the fusion areas of the weld will actually not be the weakest part of a given fabricated polymeric part.
Because many of the main welding parameters are preset on the machine, getting consistent high quality welds is possible.
Disadvantages.
If using manual extrusion welding, the welder must have a certain amount of skill in order to produce sound welds. This is especially true when welding in vertical or overhead positions. Furthermore, a manual machine could be as heavy as 12kg, which would prove to be cumbersome.

George M. Chinn

George Morgan Chinn (January 15, 1902September 4, 1987) was an American weapons expert and soldier. He attended Centre College, and played on the 1921 Centre Praying Colonels football team, which won the national championship. Chinn then opened a diner in a cave, known as 'The Cave House', which also functioned as an underground gambling center. He served as the bodyguard of Happy Chandler while he was governor of Kentucky. Chinn was also Sergeant of Arms for the Kentucky Legislature. Later he was the production line inspector for several weapons' manufacturers, and eventually, a Marine. He designed the Mk 19 grenade launcher.
Eventually one of the United States's premier arms experts, Bill Bright said of him "He did for military weapons what Wozniak and Gates did for computers. He added the right pieces to make them reliable and usable. He was what was then called a garage (in his case, cave) inventor." Chin retired to become director of the Kentucky Historical Society from 1960 to 1973, and later Kentucky Military History Museum.
Early life.
Chinn was born on January 15, 1902, to George P. Chinn (the warden of a state penitentiary) and Anna (Carlisle) Chinn (who would die eight years later). His grandfather John Pendleton Chinn, was a member of the Kentucky State Legislature. He grew up in Mundy's Landing, Kentucky. Chinn attended Braxton Hall and Millersburg Military Institute, both of which he disliked. At the Military Institute, he set a state record in the javelin throw. Though he would not graduate until 1920, in December 1918, Chinn was to have been commissioned as an officer in France, but World War I ended before he could.
While at Centre College, Chinn played football and wrote, among other places, in the local newspaper, "The Advocate." Playing as a lineman, Chinn started games in 1920 and 1921, though, as a result of constant injuries he often served as an assistant coach. He worked as a golf salesman for Lowe and Campbell Athletic Goods before leaving Centre to be assistant coach with Charley Moran at Bucknell University. Chinn left to coach at Wesleyan University, and later Catawba University (at the latter of which he was often in practice the head coach). By 1930, Chinn was recognized as one of the best college football coaches in the country.
Chinn hired a man known as Tunnel Smith to help him build a diner in a cave, which he called 'The Cave House'. The restaurant soon proved immensely popular, attracting thousands of people. On the side, he ran an illegal slot machine operation and liquor business. When arrested, Chinn was acquitted as he argued it was not an illegal game of chance, because it was impossible to win. He was also involved in restoring a ferry known as the "Iron Duke."
Military.
Unemployed, Chinn turned to his old friend, at the time governor of Kentucky, Happy Chandler. He served as a tour guide, and Sergeant at Arms for the Kentucky State Legislature. He got to know the capitol and its workings well enough that some thought he should run for governor. Chinn later served as the bodyguard for Chandler and Jack Dempsey when he spent time in Kentucky. In 1939, he took a job as a weapons consultant to the army. Eager to serve in the war, Chinn demanded to Chandler that he be allowed to join the Marines. He objected, saying "You're over forty years old, and you weigh 330 pounds! You'll get in the way and you’ll get killed, and you’ll get other people killed, too. Go home!" Eventually, Chandler relented. He was 118 pounds over the weight limit, and ten years over the age limit.
Chinn received basic training at Quantico, Virginia, and was then stationed at Fort Knox and Cherry Point. He made a series of improvements to the Browning .50 caliber machine gun, impressing his superiors. Chinn was then assigned to respond to questions regarding various guns. He worked on weaponry at the Naval Air Test Center, the Navy Proving Grounds, the Naval Aviation Ordnance Testing Station and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake. In 1945 Chinn travelled to the Pacific Theatre, inspecting capabilities of the Marines. At the end of the war, Chinn, by then a colonel was one of the most prominent weapons experts in the army.
From 1946 to 1956, Chinn worked on a four volume, 500,000 word history of the machine gun. He also worked extensively on the twenty-millimeter turret. During the Korean War, he was assigned to Seoul and Tokyo. He worked extensively on the Mk 19 grenade launcher. 
He retired from the Marine Corps as a colonel in 1962.

John Monteath Robertson

John Monteath Robertson FRS FRSE PCS CBE LLD (1900–1989) was a 20th-century Scottish chemist and crystallographer. He was the recipient of the Davy Medal in 1960 and president of the Chemical Society from 1962 to 1964.
Life.
He was born on 24 July 1900 at Nether Fordun farm near Auchterarder the son of William Robertson, farmer, and his wife, Jeannie Monteath. He was educated at Auchterarder Primary School then Perth Academy. He then studied chemistry at Glasgow University graduating BSc in 1923, MA in 1925. He then continued as a postgraduate gaining his first doctorate (PhD) in 1926. Under the advisement of G. G. Henderson, he produced a doctoral thesis entitled "The structural relationships of certain members of the bicyclic sesquiterpene series". In his graduate work, he crystallized sesquiterpene derivatives and gave them to William Henry Bragg for X-ray diffraction. He sent a caryophyllene alcohol. The structure was not solved until approximately 30 years later. 
In 1926, he began work as a researcher at the Royal Institution in London, under the tutelage of Bragg. He continued to work on sesquiterpene derivatives, but also shifted his attention to physics. In 1928 he obtained a post in physics at the University of Michigan in the United States, but returned to the Royal Institution at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory in 1930. During that time, he solved many small, organic molecule structures by X-ray crystallography. In particular, he reported the structures of several novel phthalocyanines. Robertson used heavy-metal derivatives to solve the phase problem by Isomorphous replacement, which paved the way to determine novel structures.
In 1939 he moved to Sheffield University as senior lecturer in physical chemistry. This was interrupted by the Second World War (from 1942) he served as chemical advisor to Bomber Command and scientific advisor to the RAF. From 1942 he was professor and department head of chemistry at Glasgow University. At University of Glasgow, he trained a number of students: "Among those who began X-ray work with me in Glasgow after the war are A. McL. Mathieson and J. D. Morrison (now mass spectrometry) in Melbourne, Maria Przybylska in Ottawa, J. G. White in Princeton, Jack Dunitz in Zurich, Sidney Abrahams with Bell Telephones in New York, Walter Macintyre in Boulder, James Trotter in Vancouver, M. G. Rossmann in Cambridge, H. M. M. Shearer in Durham, and J. S. Broadley and D. M. Donaldson at Dounreay, Thurso (now atomic energy). Ian Dawson (now electron microscopy), J. C. Speakman, George Sim, Tom Hamor and Andrew Porte (now nuclear magnetic resonance) are all back in Glasgow again, after adventures in other places, and are actively participating in our latest and most exciting work."In 1960, Robertson's group reported the structure of limonin, a complex organic molecule whose structure had eluded chemists since its discovery in 1841. With the structure, Robertson's group also demonstrated a clear path to apply novel computational techniques to solve the phase problem for complex organic molecules by using heavy-metal derivatives. This was a continuation of his previous work phasing organic molecules. 
In 1943 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Wilfred Cook, Thomas Alty, Edward Hindle, John Walton and James Pickering Kendall. In 1945 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In the 1962 Birthday Honours he was created a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 1963 he received an honorary doctorate (LLD) from Aberdeen University.
He retired in 1970 and died in Inverness on 27 December 1989.
Family.
In 1930 he married Stella Kennard (née Nairn) in Toronto.

Trem Carr

Tremlet C. Carr (November 6, 1891– August 18, 1946) was an American film producer, closely associated with the low-budget filmmaking of Poverty Row. In 1931 he co-founded Monogram Pictures, which developed into one of the leading specialist producers of B pictures in Hollywood.
In 1935, the company was merged into the newly created Republic Pictures, but a year later, Carr broke away and reestablished Monogram as an independent company. Following his death in 1946, Monogram changed its name to Allied Artists and began producing films made on higher budgets.
Biography.
Carr was born in Trenton, Illinois, and attended the University of Illinois. He worked for a construction firm in St. Louis. He moved into the film industry making a series of short comic features with Al St. John. He and W. Ray Johnston formed Rayart Productions, and Carr worked for him for seven years as vice president. From 1925 to 1930, he was vice president in charge of Syndicate Pictures. From 1928 to 1929, his Trem Carr Productions made 15 films.
In 1931, he helped form Monogram Pictures, becoming vice president in charge of production. (W. Ray Johnston was president.) In 1934, he was elected president of the Independent Motion Pictures Producers Association. In April 1935, Carr and Johnston reorganised Monogram as Republic Pictures. Carr became vice president of Republic Pictures. Carr eventually sold out his interests and produced a series of movies at Universal. Most of his films were "outdoor action pictures." In 1938, he rejoined the board of Monogram.
In 1940, he rejoined Monogram and stayed there until his death. He died of a heart attack while on holiday at the US Grant Hotel in San Diego. He was survived by a wife and a daughter. On Carr's death, Steve Broidy took over as executive in charge of production at Monogram.

Oleg Ryakhovskiy

Oleg Anatolevitch Ryakhovskiy (; born 19 October 1933) is a Russian former Soviet triple jumper. He is a former world record holder, the 1958 silver medallist at the European Athletics Championships, and twice Soviet national champion.
Born in Tashkent, Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic, Ryakhovskiy began to reach elite level in the 1955 track and field season, clearing a best of , which ranked him within the world's top 20 jumpers that season. He rose to seventh in the world rankings in 1957 with , then gave the best performance of the season in 1958, at . The latter mark was achieved at the Soviet Athletics Championships, where he put an end to Leonid Shcherbakov long-running streak to win his first national title.
The peak of Ryakhovskiy's career came in 1958. That year he achieved a triple jump world record of at the 1958 USA-USSR International Match, improving upon Brazilian Adhemar da Silva's three-year-old record by three centimetres. Ryakhovskiy's record stood for less than a year, as it was improved by fellow Soviet Oleg Fedoseyev the following May. Ryakhovskiy was selected for the Soviet team for the 1958 European Athletics Championships. Despite clearing sixteen metres at the competition (which no athlete had done previously) he was outperformed by Poland's Józef Szmidt and settled for European silver. He closed the season with a second straight national title at the Soviet Championships.
He had an unusual technique for the time, which relied less on lift in the jump stage and more on raw speed (he had a best of 10.6 seconds for the 100 metres). He remained high in the world rankings in the 1959, ranking fifth after clearing – the second best mark of his career, though this left him in second place behind Fedoseyev at the Spartakiade. A leg injury hampered his 1960 season; he was third nationally and dropped out of the global top ten performers. He ranked fifth in the world in 1961, but ceased to compete at a high level thereafter. He lost his state sports scholarship and instead opted for a purely academic one.
Ryakhovskiy was highly successful as a student-athlete during the period from 1957 to 1961. He won a gold medal at the 1957 World University Games in a games record – as the last winner of the competition, this record stands permanently. He followed this with two gold medals in 1959, winning at the World Festival of Youth and Students and then defeating Japanese Koji Sakurai and Hiroshi Shibata to claim the first ever men's triple jump title at the Universiade. He attempted to defend his Universiade title two years later, but was narrowly beaten by Romania's Sorin Ioan.
Ryakhovskiy studied sports science up to doctorate level at Moscow State Technical University and later became a professor there. Studying the mechanics of athletics, he served on the Technical Committee for the International Association of Athletics Federations for twelve years. Among his recommendations for the sport is a new method of recording false starts in sprint races. Ryakhovskiy argues that the current approach (measurement of pressure upon the starting blocks) unfairly impedes athletes who are stronger, heavier, or favour a starting technique with more backwards leg pressure. He has suggested using a light beam to measure movement of athlete's hands from the starting line, which is the first body part to move and can be measured equally across all athletes.

The Frauenau Glass Museum () in Frauenau in the Lower Bavarian county of Regen, previously a communal facility, has become a state-owned organisation since early 2014 called the State Museum of the History of Glass Culture ("Staatliches Museum zur Geschichte der Glaskultur") run by the Free State of Bavaria. The museum curator is the art-historian, Karin Rühl.
The museum was opened on May 6, 1975 by the founder of the museum, Alfons Hannes, in the presence of numerous international glass artists, includig Erwin Eisch and Harvey Littleton, with the highly regarded special exhibition "Venini-Murano" (Wolfgang Kermer collection).
Donation Wolfgang Kermer.
In 1982, the museum received a significant donation from the private studio glass collection of Wolfgang Kermer.
The following artists are represented in the donation:
In 2017, Wolfgang Kermer donated well over a hundred hand-blown French glasses, typical of the long-gone glassworks in the to-day regions Grand Est and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté. Although the origin and dating of the glasses, formerly mass-produced goods, today rarity, are often difficult to determine – Wolfgang Kermer described his donation ″Homage to the unknown glassblower″ – several glasses can be combined with the glass factory La Rochere (Franche-Comté).

Arthur Child (judge)

The Honourable Arthur Child (20 November 1852 – 24 August 1902) was a British lawyer, jurist and colonial administrator, who was Chief Justice of St Lucia from 1890 to 1902.
Career.
Child was born in 1852, the 11th child of Henry Child, a solicitor in London. He was from a family of lawyers, two of his father′s brothers were also solicitors.

Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Frauenau

The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary () is the Roman Catholic parish church of the town of Frauenau in the county of Regen in the Bavarian Forest in Germany.
History.
Saint Hermann (of Niederaltaich) lived from 1324 until his death in 1326 as a hermit in a monastic cell in the ancient forest. His successor, Hartwig of Degenberg, built a chapel for a miraculous figure, "Our Dear Lady" ("Unserer lieben Frau"), the Blessed Virgin Mary. The region of "Our Dear Lady of Au" ("Unsere liebe Frau Au") belonged to Niederaltaich Abbey on the River Danube. From the 14th century to the late 18th century, the miraculous image of the "Dolorous Mother of God" ("schmerzhafte Muttergottes") was the destination of a pilgrimage. As early as 1352, Frauenau was therefore elevated to a parish and, in 1396, a Gothic church was built. Its architect was Hans Krumenauer (father of Stephan Krumenauer), who was also involved in the cathedral in Passau. From 1759 to 1767 a new church was built in the rococo style. The church was consecrated on 15 August 1767 and placed under the protection of Mary, the Mother of God. Until secularisation in 1803, the parish of Frauenau was managed by Niederaltaich Abbey and Priory of Rinchnach. In 1927 the church was extended to the west.

Guntherstein

The Guntherstein (c.) is a crag in the Bavarian Forest with good views, high above the bowl of the Lallinger Winkel and village of Lalling in Bavaria, Germany.
The name comes from Saint Gunther, who once moved from Niederalteich Abbey to the then empty and primeval Bavarian Forest, cleared parts of the forests for settlement and later settled himself in the Bohemian Forest.
The "Gunthersteig", a hiking trail that leads in several days from Niederalteich via the Guntherstein and the border crossing at Gsenget to St. Gunther's Church in Czech near Hartmanice, still commemorates him today.
From this prominent rock there is a view over the Lallinger Winkel south to the Danube plain. On clear föhn days the view reaches as far as the Alps.

Before the Dead

Before the Dead is an album by Jerry Garcia. It is a compilation of early recordings of Garcia playing folk and bluegrass music with various other musicians. The recordings were made from 1961 to 1964, before Garcia co-founded the rock band the Grateful Dead. Produced as a four-CD box set, and also as a five-LP limited edition box set, it was released on May 11, 2018.
Recording.
In the early 1960s, the American folk music revival was in full swing, and the San Francisco Bay Area had its own folk scene. In 1961, after getting out of the Army, Jerry Garcia started playing folk music and other old-time songs. Garcia would sing and play acoustic guitar as a member of various ensembles and bands. Over the next few years, Garcia also become interested in bluegrass music, and learned to play the banjo. As his music skills evolved, he continued to play in different bands with similarly inclined musicians. A number of these performances were captured on reel-to-reel tape. In 1965, after a dalliance with jug band music, Garcia co-founded the rock band the Grateful Dead.
"Before the Dead" includes performances by several musicians who also collaborated with Garcia in later years. Robert Hunter wrote the lyrics for many Grateful Dead songs; David Nelson was a member of the New Riders of the Purple Sage; and Nelson and Sandy Rothman were members of the Jerry Garcia Acoustic Band.
Production.
"Before the Dead" was produced by Dennis McNally, an author and former publicist for the Grateful Dead, and Brian Miksis, a documentarian and audio engineer. The two worked together to track down some of the original recordings from Jerry Garcia's formative years as a musician. They also assembled many new short essays about the songs and the early '60s folk scene in the Bay Area, along with photographs from that time.
The 1962 performance by the Hart Valley Drifters, at the studio of Stanford University radio station KZSU, was previously released as the album "Folk Time".
Critical reception.
In "Rolling Stone", David Browne wrote, "... Garcia spent several years immersed in bluegrass and folk, playing in a succession of Palo Alto-area bands with oddball names like the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers. To date, only a small portion of the recordings he made with those combos has been released, making the multi-disc "Before the Dead" the deepest – and most educational – dive yet into Garcia's pre-Dead musical life. Right up to his death, Garcia would periodically revisit his bluegrass roots, from the wonderful but short-lived Old &amp; In the Way to albums he made with mandolinist David Grisman. But "Before the Dead" reveals, in more detail than ever before, when and how that appetite began and why numbers like "Deep Elem Blues" and "Rosa Lee McFall", both heard here, made their way into the Dead's repertoire."
In "DownBeat", Jesse Jarnow said, "An illuminating new box set, "Before the Dead"... shines light on Garcia's earliest music – recordings between 1961 and 1964 – most often remembered as his "bluegrass period" for his virtuosic banjo playing. But the four-CD/five-LP collection reveals a far richer picture... No casual player, the nearly four hours of music uncover a musician filled with ambition and energy. By a year after the earliest recording, Garcia had turned to banjo. That, too, became a progression, from the ghostly frailings of the Sleepy Hollow Hog Stompers, recorded in June 1962 ("Little Birdie"), to the shredding Bill Keith style he'd accentuated by his time with the Black Mountain Boys in 1964 ("Salt Creek"). The sequence resulted in Garcia's instantly recognizable electric guitar playing with the Dead, each crystalline, articulated note picked with a banjoist’s precision."
In "Glide Magazine", Doug Collette wrote, "In roughly three and half hours of live and studio recordings, captured in various ways at a variety of locales between 1961 and 1964, "Before the Dead" documents the late Jerry Garcia's formative years as a musician. Overflowing with meticulous attention to detail in sound, text and graphics, this 4-CD/5-LP box set reveals how this iconic musician nurtured those attributes that eventually stood him in such good stead as titular leader of the Grateful Dead... If "Before the Dead" proves anything, it is that this man's passion for playing, as well as his insatiable curiosity about a diversity of styles, traditional and otherwise, was well-established long before the coalescence of the Grateful Dead."

2018 Fijian general election

General elections were held in Fiji on 14 November 2018. The result was a victory for the ruling FijiFirst party of Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama, which received just over 50% of the vote and 27 of the 51 seats in Parliament, a loss of five seats. The main opposition party, Social Democratic Liberal Party, gained six seats, whilst the National Federation Party retained its three seats.
The elections also saw female representation in Parliament rise to 20 percent, with 10 women elected.
Background and campaign.
On 30 September Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama announced that the elections would be held on 14 November 2018. President Jioji Konrote subsequently dissolved parliament in accordance with section 58(3) of the constitution, on the advice of the Prime Minister.
234 candidates representing six political parties contested in the elections. 56 of the candidates were women. Candidate numbers for the ballot paper were drawn on 18 October. The Labour Party and Freedom Alliance Party presented a combined party list under the Labour Party banner.
During a campaign rally, FijiFirst leader Frank Bainimarama stated that he wanted to win all 51 parliamentary seats and govern without an opposition, arguing that the two main opposition parties represented i-Taukei and Indo-Fijian interests rather than all Fijians. The SODELPA party promised to restore the Great Council of Chiefs within a hundred days if elected, and to consider changing the electoral system to restore communal constituencies. They later explicitly promised to restore the 1997 constitution.
During the election campaign SODELPA leader Sitiveni Rabuka was tried and acquitted on charges of falsely declaring his assets and liabilities to the Supervisor of Elections. An appeal by the Fiji Independent Commission Against Corruption, which could have resulted in Rabuka's disqualification two days from the poll, was dismissed, with FICAC ordered to pay costs. Shortly before the appeal was decided Rabuka was again called in by police on unspecified charges.
On election day, voting was suspended at 26 polling stations due to torrential rain and flooding. Ballots cast at those stations were shredded. Polling recommenced with fresh ballot papers on Saturday 17 November.
Electoral system.
The 51 members of Parliament were elected from a single nationwide constituency by open list proportional representation with an electoral threshold of 5%. Seats are allocated using the d'Hondt method.
Schedule.
Key dates relating to the general election were as follows:
Aftermath.
The ruling FijiFirst Party lost 5 seats, but retained a majority in Parliament. FijiFirst leader Frank Bainimarama blamed poor weather for the loss of votes. Bainimarama was sworn in as Prime Minister on 20 November 2018.

Views.
Gill has expressed support for partial-decriminalisation of assisted suicide so that people would not be prosecuted for helping end the lives of their terminally ill relatives, stating in 2005 that "There is a very strong compassionate case for voluntary euthanasia". In a submission to the Select Committee on Science and Technology in 2007, he stated that he supports a gradualist approach to abortions in that early abortions are preferable to late abortions and the limit should be the point of foetal viability (22 weeks): "In terms of the gradualist position it would be consistent to reduce both the upper limit for abortions and the procedures that may be delaying first trimester abortions unnecessarily."
Personal life.

Konstantin Grcic

Konstantin Grcic (born 1965) is a German industrial designer known for creating mass-manufactured items, such as furniture and household products. Described as having a pared down aesthetic, his functional designs are characterized by geometric shapes and unexpected angles.
Background.
Grcic was born in Munich, Germany, in 1965, to a father from the former Yugoslavia and a German mother, and grew up in Wuppertal. As a child Grcic loved to build things, and during high-school he restored furniture.
Grcic studied cabinetry making in the Arts and Crafts tradition at the John Makepeace School for Craftsmen in Wood in London, starting in 1985. in 1988, he began his graduate studies in Industrial Design at London's Royal College of Art. Grcic worked with British designer Jasper Morrison in the late 1980s until 1990, when he began designing furniture for SCP, one of London's largest design stores. He credits his time in London for helping develop his individual style, describing "... his experiences in England as stirring his creative potential."
Career.
Portfolio.
Grcic founded his studio, "Konstantin Grcic Industrial Design" (KGID), in 1991 in Munich, Germany. Working with a staff of five, he creates "... pieces that have been described as both revolutionary and intelligent." According to the New York Times, he has a "... rigorous focus on logic, utility and simplicity".
With an emphasis on usability, Grcic is known for having a spartan approach to design, relying on geometric forms, unusual angles and hard edges. He has created installations and developed products such as furniture, lighting, watches, tableware, espresso makers, and even umbrellas. Grcic became recognized for his 1995 Refolo trolley, 1997 Wanda dish rack, 1998 award-winning Mayday lamp, 1999 ES shelf and 2001 Chaos chair.
His iconic 2004 Chair_One and 2006 Miura stool are both described as being comfortable to sit on, despite their oddly shaped compositions. Grcic has a philosophical approach to design, especially when it comes to seating products, his favourite objects to tackle, "Designing chairs touches issues of society, how we live...How life changes - that’s most interesting.".
He has used cutting edge technology, such as high-tech ceramics and 3D modeling software, to create his mass-produced items. Advanced engineering plastics were the basis of his award-winning Myto Chair, launched at the Milan Furniture Fair in 2008. Grcic also relies on low-tech solutions to advance the design process, manually creating and deconstructing rough paper models. An engineering-oriented approach and extensive research make up his methodology, something attributed to his upbringing, "...his penchant for amassing large amounts of data before he starts to work is nothing if not German." 
His furniture and lighting designs, including the likes of OK pendant light and Noctambule lighting pay testimony to his signature ability to thread the needle between restraint and playfulness.
Exhibits and media.
In 2009, the Chicago Art Institute held a retrospective of Grcic's work. Zoë Ryan, who curated the exhibit, states that the designer "is very mindful of how we interact with and use objects". In 2014, a Grcic exhibition of fictional products was showcased at the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany. His design pieces are also found in the permanent collections of the MoMA in New York City and the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris.
In 2005, London's Phaidon Press published the first book examining Grcic's body of work. Other publications include monographs accompanying his museum exhibitions. He is also the subject of various design books like "How to Design a Chair", as well as "Chroma: Design, Architecture and Art in Color" where he mentions how the Lego color palette has inspired him. A film about Grcic's developmental process was screened at "A Design Film Festival 2017" held in Singapore.
Related activities.
In 2009, Grcic curated an exhibition called "Design Real" at the Serpentine Gallery in London, England. He selected products with a practical function, from well known and lesser known designers, which reflected the first ten years of the millennium. In 2010, he curated two shows, one for France's "St. Etienne Design Biennale" and the other for the Istituto Svizzero (Swiss Institute) in Rome.
Grcic has also participated in design initiatives happening in Belgrade, Serbia, such as speaking at "Belgrade Design Week" or sitting on the juries of the "Mikser Festival" and the "University of Arts in Belgrade" final year competition. Concerning the burgeoning design scene in Serbia's capital city, Grcic has said,"I was not sure what to expect but I encountered a fantastic atmosphere and amazing people." The 2014 retrospective exhibition on Grcic's work, Panorama, held at the Vitra Design Museum, featured the installation Life Stage. Life Stage was a fictitious product meant as a mobile power source made of the eco-friendly resin Acrodur.
Awards and honours.
In 2001, Grcic received a "Compasso d’Oro" award for his Mayday lamp. He won another "Compasso d’Oro" in 2011 for his Myto chair. He won two "Designpreis Deutschland" prizes, from the Government of Germany, for his Chair_ONE and Miura stool in 2006 and 2007 respectively. In 2006, his Miura stool also received a "Best of the Best" Red Dot award and an IF Design Award.
In 2010, Grcic was named "Designer of the Year" at Design Miami, where he also created an installation consisting of seating made with polypropylene netting. In 2016, Dezeen magazine listed him as number 14 on their list of top 100 designers, based on the 48 articles written about him. That same year he also received the "Best Designer of the Year" award at the Salone del Mobile in Milan.

Michael Barnes (arts administrator)

Michael Barnes (31 October 1932 – 14 May 2008) was an arts administrator and promoter, primarily in Northern Ireland, where he was director of the Belfast Festival at Queen's (originally the Queen's University Festival) and the Grand Opera House, Belfast.
Born in Peckham, South London, he became interested in theatre while attending Alleyn's School on a scholarship. Having also received a scholarship to Wadham College, Oxford, he took a first in history and, after graduating, became a lecturer in modern history at the University of Edinburgh. Whilst in Edinburgh, he took part in shows during the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, but found that "learning huge dollops of script wasn’t all that appealing".
In 1961, he became a Lecturer in History at Queen's University Belfast, but continued to have an interest in the arts. The arts festival which would later become the Queen's University Festival was founded by a student, Michael Emmerson, in 1962, and Barnes quickly became involved. When Emmerson started a Belfast branch of the National Film Theatre as the Queen's Film Theatre in 1968, Barnes was the chairman of the film sub-committee.
Belfast Festival.
In 1973, Barnes was a senior lecturer in modern history at Queen's, when the role of Director of the Queen's University Festival became vacant. The Festival was in financial and creative difficulties and its future was uncertain. Queen's agreed to allow him to work on the Festival while remaining in his academic post, and Barnes became the Director, a post he would hold until 1994. Under Barnes' leadership, the Festival became the second largest in the British Isles after the Edinburgh Festival, and was able to attract internationally known performers, even during The Troubles, when many artists and audiences were reluctant to visit Northern Ireland. Performers included the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Moscow State Ballet, Yehudi Menuhin and local talents like Seamus Heaney and James Galway. Barnes also promoted newer artists like Nikolai Demidenko, Trestle Theatre, Philip Hammond, Rowan Atkinson and Billy Connolly.
In the 1970s, Belfast's Grand Opera House was going to be sold and demolished. It was instead purchased by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland, who successfully applied to make it the first listed building in Northern Ireland. Barnes supervised an extensive renovation, and when the Opera House re-opened in 1980, he was the artistic director. He left his academic post in 1976, to concentrate full-time on his roles in the arts; his dual role helped the Opera House become a significant venue for the Festival. He continued in this position until 1994, and undertook two further refurbishments in 1991 and 1993, when the building, which was situated adjacent to the Europa Hotel - the "most bombed hotel in Europe" - was damaged by explosions.
After his retirement in 1994, his health began to suffer, and he lived in a nursing home in Belfast until his death in 2008.
In 1981, Barnes had convinced Michael Palin to perform his first solo show at the Belfast Festival; he returned every other year after. Belfast was the only place where Palin performed his one-man shows, saying that nowhere could be "better than the Belfast Festival". The two men became friends, and after Barnes' death, Palin set up a drama scholarship programme at Queen's University in his memory.

Daniel M. Russell

Daniel M. Russell is an American computer scientist who is a senior research scientist at Google. He teaches on the subject of effective web-search strategies, using large-scale teaching systems developed by him at Google. Russell sometimes refers to himself as a "search anthropologist" for his focus on user experience in web search and improving sensemaking of information with technology. Russell is also a Resident Futurist at University of Maryland, where he works for the Office of the Vice-President for Research.
Russell has held research positions with IBM (as a senior research scientist, and briefly at a startup that developed tablet computers a few years before the iPad. ), Apple Inc. (where he wrote the first 100 web pages for www.Apple.com using SimpleText.) and Xerox over the course of his career.
Education.
Russell graduated from University of California at Irvine with a B.S. in Information and Computer Science (1977). He received his M.S (1979) and Ph.D. (1985) in Computer Science from University of Rochester. His doctoral work was titled "Schema-Based Problem Solving" which was based on "using recombinations of pre-stored plans in sophisticated ways". While at University of Rochester, Russell did research work in "the neuropsychology of laterality, models of apraxia and aphasia, coordinated motor movements and computer vision".
Career.
Russell joined Xerox Corporation in 1981 where he worked as a consultant at the Webster Research Center in New York. Russell then became a Research Associate where he engaged in AI research and the development of Interlisp-D courses. In 1982, he joined the research staff at PARC. Until 1991, he led a project called "Instructional Design Environment" (IDE) with Richard Burton and Thomas P. Moran to "develop a practical computer-aided design and analysis system for use in ill-structured design tasks". He then worked in the User Interface Research group, led by Stuart Card, which studied the uses of information visualization techniques.
Russell worked at Apple in the Advanced Technology Group sector from 1993 to 1997. He managed research within the User Experience Research Group which studied issues of sensemaking, cognitive modelling of analysis tasks, synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, shared awareness of individual state, joint work coordination, and knowledge-based use of complex, heterogenous information. Alongside his research, he developed applications such as Knowbots and AI planner-based assistants for Macintosh OS. Russell subsequently became the Director of the Knowledge Management Technologies laboratory where he led the research efforts in five areas: Intelligent Systems, Spoken Language, User Experience, Interaction Design, and Information Technology. As Director, Russell also worked alongside the Apple CEO Tim Cook and founder Steve Jobs in corporation on Network Computing.
Russell was an adjunct lecturer on the Engineering and Computer Science faculty of the University of Santa Clara (1998), and has taught special topics classes in Artificial Intelligence at Stanford University (1994).
Russell returned to Xerox in 1997 where he worked as a manager in the User Experience Research area through 2000. From 1998 to 1999, Russell led the Madcap project, a system to capture, organize and render large amounts of complex presentation materials into an understandable whole. The project is implemented in Java and Quicktime.
Russell joined IBM in 2000, where he managed a research group in the User Sciences and Experience Research (USER) lab at the IBM Almaden Research Center. He subsequently became a senior manager where he led larger research groups in areas covering user experience design of large systems. Until 2005, he engaged in understanding sensemaking behaviour of people dealing with mass information collection. He has also contributed in the design and use case studies in the BlueBoard system as a collaboration tool. BlueBoard is a large interactive system and display surface for collaboration whose primary goal was to support quick information access and sharing through shoulder-to-shoulder collaboration. The tool was also used to explore computer interfaces in public spaces. The project's success led it to be installed in the main lobby of the IBM Watson Research Lab as well as the boardroom of IBM CEO Lou Gerstner per his request.
Russell joined Google in 2005; as of 2018, he is a senior research scientist and lead for the research area of "Search Quality &amp; User Happiness". He coordinated the development of two Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) on effective searching skills which were launched in 2012 on PowerSearchingWithGoogle.com, which had more than 3 million students. In September of 2019, MIT Press and Dr. Russell 4.4M people have taken Power Searching with Google MOOC
He also led a Search Education team that developed A-Google-Day, launched April 11, 2011, a large-scale teaching system in which users can practice their searching skills with Google. The software package for it was later re-packaged and offered on Google's Course Builder.
Russell have also given commencement address, lectures and keynote conferences about different topics in Academy.
Russell have helped the world to search better, investing time with random people studying how they search for stuff. Russell added in the interview: "One statistic blew my mind. 90 percent of people in their studies don't know how to use CTRL/Command + F to find a word in a document or web page!" This information has been also translated to other languages, like in Spanish And by creating videos ("1 Minute Morceaux" on his YouTube Channel) and giving tips to improve Web Literacy.
On March 26, 2019. Russell mentioned on Twitter that his quest is to teach the world to be better at online research In the same tweet and also on his blog, Russell, shared his most recent publication, this one on Scientific American called:"How to Be a Better Web Searcher: Secrets from Google Scientists", done with Mario Callegaro.
On March 27, 2019, Russell also announced on his blog, the Amazon ordering entry for his book:The Joy of Search, published by MIT Press
September 24th, 2019, his book, The Joy of Search is on sale Which have been reviewed and presented in different venues and by different people. For example, Jill O'Neill, Director of Content for NISO (National Information Standards Organization) And, Keynote Conference ("The Joy of Search: Augmenting intelligence by teaching people how to Search"), in the International Conference of Education, Research and Innovation (ICERI)
Research.
Russell's research focus has been human experience with search engines and in large, complex collections of information. He aims to design comprehensible and intuitive ways for users to engage with information effectively. Particular topics include the design of information experience; sensemaking; intelligent agents; knowledge-based assistance; information visualization; multimedia documents; advanced design and development environments; design rationale; planning; intelligent tutoring; hypermedia; and human–computer interfaces.
While developing AI technology at Xerox PARC, Russell realized that sophisticated technology was useless if people did not intuitively know how to use it. This motivated him to shift his focus to the sciences of user experience.
In 2011, Russell taught effective searching skills and enhancing learning efficacy. Russell also investigated new approaches to dealing with the growing amount of available information.
Authored publications and cited works.
Russell's authored publications in topics including education innovation, human–computer interaction and visualization, information retrieval and the web, and mobile systems can be found on the Google AI website. His works are widely cited by other authors.
Personal life.
Russell blogs on effective searching skills as well as his own investigations in sensemaking and information foraging.
Russell started writing his blog, SearchResearch, in 2010.
On October 23, 2013, Russell appeared on Lifehacker's "The How I Work series", interviewed by Tessa Miller. On it, Russell describes a day in his life, how he works and some personal topics 
On August 9, 2017, his blog arrived to the first 1,000 posts.
Awards.
Russell was inducted into the CHI Academy (ACM) in 2016. He was added to the UC Irvine Information &amp; Computer Science Department Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2013, Russell received the UC Irvine Bren School's 2013 Lauds &amp; Laurels Distinguished Alumnus award.

La Casa del High Jinks

La Casa del High Jinks is a historic house located on High Jinks Ranch in Pinal County, Arizona, southeast of the community of Oracle. The ranch was founded in 1912 by Buffalo Bill Cody, who ran a gold mine at the site. After Cody's death, the ranch was seized for unpaid taxes and subsequently sold to Lewis Claude Way. Way built the Pueblo style ranch house on the property, which he completed in 1928. The house is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 
High Jinks Ranch is surrounded by the Coronado National Forest and is a gateway to the Arizona Trail, an 800-mile (1,300 km) long trail that traverses the north-south length of Arizona. The ranch has vast views of the Galiuro Mountains and Bassett Peak (elev. 7,663 feet (2,336 m)). 
The closest town to the ranch is Oracle, a 20 minute drive away. Situated in the foothills of the north slope of the Santa Catalina Mountains, Oracle is well-known for Biosphere 2, a large-scale experimental apparatus housing seven model ecosystems. Its mission was a two-year closure experiment with a crew of eight humans ("biospherians"). Long-term it was seen as a precursor to gain knowledge about the use of closed biospheres in space colonization. In addition to housing Biosphere 2, Oracle is remote enough to have received an International Dark Sky Park designation in 2014 from the International Dark-Sky Association. Oracle is far enough away from light pollution for numerous celestial bodies to become visible. The town has some of the darkest nights in the continental United States. 
The ranch is a one-hour drive from Tucson and Saguaro National Park, a two-hour drive from Phoenix, a 2.5-hour drive from Tombstone, and 3 hours from Bisbee. 
History.
Settlement and construction.
The Ranch's area was called "Campo Bonito" and mostly populated by mine (gold, silver, other ores) diggers. The property still contains deposits of black diorite.
On April 14, 1912, Buffalo Bill Cody and his foster son Lewis Henry "Johnny" Baker established High Jinks as a gold mine and ranch; it is unknown which of the two came up with the name. Cody visited a cabin at the ranch until his death in 1917; however, the mine produced little gold, and Cody never saw a return on his investment. The High Jinks Gold Mining Company failed to pay property taxes on the mine for several years, resulting in its seizure by Pinal County in 1921; the county then sold the property to the State of Arizona.
Lewis Claude Way purchased the property from the state for $56.14 in March 1922. Way was a Spanish–American War veteran and a U.S. forest ranger who served as superintendent of both Rocky Mountain National Park and Grand Canyon National Park; he was also a friend of Cody and Baker. With the help of his wife, Marie Burgess Way, and Mexican laborers, Way built the two-story ranch house over the next few years, completing it circa 1928. The Ways moved into their new house upon its completion; Baker and his wife, Olive, lived with them until Baker's death in 1931, after which Olive only lived at the house part-time. Lewis died in 1944, and Marie sold the property the following year, after which it passed through several different owners. The first remodeling at High Jinks was done in 1964 by then-owner Lester Nauman, a gold prospector and electronics repairman. Nauman did work on two bathrooms and covered the original fir sheathing on the ceiling and walls of the family room and master bedroom with pine paneling.
According to Harold Bell Wright in his book "The Mine with the Iron Door" (1923), Johnny Baker used stulls found in surrounding mines to build the Ranch's juniper wood carvings.
Protection and development.
The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 16, 1996.
For three decades and until 2007, the estate was owned by journalist E. Dean Prichard who preserved it and contributed to the launch of the Arizona Trail. E. Dean Prichard built the archway (porte-cochere) leading to the Ranch during the 1980s. He also added a carport, a tackroom/entry/storage building,
stables, a ramada, and the four casitas, three of which are small, frame houses and the other a mobile home. Inside the house, E. Dean Prichard added stairs to the third floor.
The house was abandoned up until 2010 when Dan Blanco and his wife, Laurel Wilson, purchased it and continued its renovation until Blanco's death in 2016. 
Description.
Features.
La Casa del High Jinks is approximately 51 feet by 31 feet, 30 feet high. The foundation consists of granite and concrete walls.
Style.
La Casa del High Jinks is an example of the Pueblo Revival style, a reinterpretation of traditional Pueblo architecture which was popular among white settlers in the Southwest in the early 20th century. The Pueblo Revival style, along with Mexican-inspired styles such as Spanish Colonial Revival, came to define regional architecture of the era. The two-story cube-shaped home was built with granite and wood, both of which were collected from the ranch site. The house features massive stone exterior walls with projecting wooden vigas, a characteristic element of the Pueblo style; other Pueblo elements of the house include its flat roof and wooden lintels. Later owners built several modern structures on the home site, including a carport, stables, pool, and four casitas.
In popular culture.
La Casa del High Jinks was the filming location for the 1924 motion picture "The Mine with the Iron Door". The film is based on the novel of the same name by American Author Harold Bell Wright published in 1923. The story of a lost mine with an iron door located deep within the Santa Catalina mountains has persisted for several hundred years. The mine has been one of the most extensively hunted lost mines in North America. 
The 1895 Bain 9-A buckboard (a four-wheeled wagon), which was used by Elizabeth Taylor and Tom Skerritt in the 1987 American made-for-television western romance film "Poker Alice", is exhibited at the ranch. The movie is based on the real-life story of Alice Moffat (1851-1930), an English poker player in the American West.
During E. Dean Prichard's time at High Jinks he wrote "A Metaphysical Autobiography: Revelations of a Galaxy Goddess" cataloging his heteronormative sexual encounter at the ranch with the alien goddess Tinr and her prophesies. 
Residents have recorded periodic sightings of two feral donkeys, Pancho and Crackers, who have made their home in the forest surrounding High Jinks Ranch since 2014.

2018–19 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team

The 2018–19 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team represented the University of Kansas in the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, which was the Jayhawks' 121st basketball season. The Jayhawks, members of the Big 12 Conference, played their home games at Allen Fieldhouse in Lawrence, Kansas. They were led by 16th year Hall of Fame head coach Bill Self.
Season notes.
The Jayhawks entered the season with high expectations due to returning All-Big 12 players Udoka Azubuike and LaGerald Vick, adding three 2018 McDonald's All-Americans, and several transfers coming off their redshirt years. Following the 2017–18 season, several sports websites ranked Kansas 1st on their "Way too early rankings" which preview the next season. The Jayhawks also entered the season ranked number 1 in the AP Poll. Despite the high expectations, the team dealt with adversity during the season as four different players that were expected to be starters missed time. Silvio De Sousa was declared ineligible by the NCAA, Udoka Azubuike underwent season ending surgery in January, Marcus Garrett missed five games due to injury, and LaGerald Vick took a leave absence in February to handle personal issues and eventually announced he wouldn't return. On February 23, 2019, the Jayhawks lost to Texas Tech 62-91. The loss was the Jayhawks worst conference loss under Bill Self and worst conference loss since the 1999-2000 season when they lost to Oklahoma State 53-86. Following a 68–81 loss to Oklahoma on March 5, the Jayhawks were eliminated from Big 12 regular season title contention, ending their NCAA record streak of 14 consecutive titles.
Roster and coaching staff changes.
Graduation.
Below are players who graduated from the University of Kansas without any college eligibility left.

Format.
A single round was held, with each team making six dives. Eleven judges scored each dive: three for each diver, and five for synchronisation. Only the middle score counted for each diver, with the middle three counting for synchronisation. These five scores were averaged, multiplied by 3, and multiplied by the dive's degree of difficulty to give a total dive score. The scores for each of the five dives were summed to give a final score.

Mad Foxes

Mad Foxes (originally titled Los Violadores) is a Spanish exploitation thriller film directed by Paul Grau.
Plot.
A wealthy Spanish playboy seeks violent revenge on the Nazi biker gang that murders his family.
Critical reception.
Critics have called "Mad Foxes" "the ultimate exploitation movie" and "one of the nuttiest films ever." Australian film critic and editor of "Senses of Cinema" Alexandra Heller-Nicholas in her book "Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study" (2011) called the film a "brazenly incoherent mélange of kung fu, softcore porn, Nazi fetishism and bike film pegged loosely to a rape-revenge structure, albeit one caught in a garbled narrative loop".

List of first women mayors in the United States

After Kansas granted women the right to vote in municipal elections in February 1887, Susanna Madora Salter was elected mayor of Argonia, Kansas on April 4, 1887 and became the first female mayor in the United States. Salter had been nominated without her knowledge or consent, as a stunt intended to discourage women from participation in the political process. In 1862, Nancy Smith won the mayoral election of Oskaloosa, Iowa, after being nominated as a "joke", but she declined to hold office.
Following the adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1920, Bertha Knight Landes became the first woman mayor of a city with more than 150,000 residents, after she was elected mayor of Seattle, Washington in 1926.

Svalbard Bryggeri

Svalbard Bryggeri is a microbrewery in Longyearbyen at the island of Spitsbergen, the archipelago of Svalbard, Norway. Svalbard Bryggeri at 78° North is the northernmost commercial brewery in the world.
Establishing a brewery on the Svalbard archipelago required a change of Norwegian law, which prohibited commercial production of alcoholic beverages there. This meant that production was only started as late as 2015, after the law was changed by the Storting and an Italian supplier of equipment delivered and installed them.
The brew is characterized by that 16% of the water used for brewing are thawed ice from the 2,000 year old Bogerbreen glacier.

<doc id="57005055" url="?curid=57005055" title="Shoshana Borochov">
Shoshana Borochov

Shoshana Borochov (; September 9, 1912 – November 18, 2004) was the daughter of Ber Borochov, one of the founders of socialist Zionism. For over a decade she was married to Thomas James Wilkin, an Assistant Superintendent in the Criminal Investigation Department of the Palestine Police, who was assassinated by the Lehi on September 29, 1944.
Childhood.
On the occasion of his Zionist activity, Shoshana's father, Ber Borochov, wandered among the capitals of Europe, and participated in the Seventh World Zionist Congress held in 1905 in Basel. Before leaving for the Congress, he married Lyuba, a member of a rabbinic family who studied languages at Moscow State University. At the end of the Congress, he continued his wanderings among various European capitals, avoiding being arrested in Russia. 
In 1909, Borochov arrived in Vienna and stayed there with his wife Lyuba until 1914. In 1912, Shoshana was born in Vienna.
In 1914, by the outbreak of the First World War, Borochov moved with his wife and daughter to Italy, and from there they sailed to the United States, where they lived in New York. With the outbreak of the revolution in Russia in 1917, Borochov returned to Russia. After the October Revolution, in December 1917, Borochov died in Kiev from pneumonia, when he was thirty six years old.
In the land of Israel.
In 1925, Lyuba with her two children, Shoshana aged thirteen and David, immigrated to Mandatory Palestine by the Fourth Aliyah and lived with them in an apartment in workers' dormitories on Dov Hoz street in Tel Aviv. For her livelihood, the mother worked first in the Zionist Executive and later in the Executive Committee of the Histadrut.
Shoshana studied at the Herzliya Hebrew Gymnasium and graduated in the summer of 1930. Shoshana wanted to aid her family and looked for a job. With the help of Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, who was the chairman of the Jewish National Council, Shoshana got an office job at HaMerkaz HaHakla'i. Her additional jobs were teaching English lessons for the children of neighbors and writing articles of women's affairs in the newspaper "Davar".
At that time, the poet Alexander Penn courted her, but she rejected his courtship due to his drinking habits and womanizing.
Wilkin.
The person.
Thomas James Wilkin was born in England in 1909. He joined the Palestine Police Force in Mandatory Palestine in 1930. At first he took a police course and then served for several months at the Bethlehem police station. For the next eight years he served in the Jaffa police.
Their familiarity – Ram Oren version.
In his historical novel "Red Days", which was published in 2006, the writer Ram Oren described the story of the love of Wilkin and Shoshana. Ram Oren's version of the circumstances of the acquaintance was that Wilkin met Shoshana Borochov at the first time when, at the end of his first week of serving in Jaffa, he and his friends toured the streets of Tel Aviv. They entered the "Tarshish" cafe, and Shoshana sat by a table on which she wrote an article for "Davar". Shoshana drew Wilkin's attention and he went to get to know her, but she turned him away. Two years later he met her again in March 1933 at the Purim party which was made by Baruch Agadati and was held at Eden Cinema, but got cold shoulders from her. After the artistic program had ended, the orchestra started playing and the participants began dancing. Wilkin returned to Shoshana and invited her to dance with him. After a hesitation, she agreed. While talking, he found that her English was excellent, and asked her if she could teach him the Hebrew language for a fee. Shoshana replied that she would think about it and would inform him of her decision in a letter to his address. A few days later she sent him a letter, informing him of her agreement to teach him Hebrew and inviting him to her home. Thus began the relationship between them, which lasted eleven years until his assassination by Lehi on September 29, 1944.
An investigation officer.
After a few months of studies by Shoshana, Wilkin reached a good level in Hebrew. He used to sit at cafes with Jews and collect a lot of information. Wilkin was considered as an outstanding officer in the British police and got three decorations for excellence. In 1938, Wilkin moved to serve in the British Intelligence headquarters in Tel Aviv. As an officer who had mastered Hebrew, Wilkin was considered a dangerous enemy, especially by the underground organizations who recognized his abilities and were afraid of him. Wilkin was involved in investigations and torture of the Irgun and Lehi members, and in raiding the Irgun headquarters in 1939, and was the right hand of Assistant Superintendent Geoffrey J. Morton, who on February 12, 1942 shot and killed Lehi commander Avraham Stern (Yair) by a pistol.
All the while his ties with Shoshana grew stronger. The connection between them was widely known, and Shoshana received verbal and written threats. Her brother David was concerned because he had broadcast over the Haganah's underground radio station, and feared that Wilkin would turn him in. The director of the Agricultural Center demanded that she cut off her ties with Wilkin, and when she refused, he fired her from her job. Her only source of income remained the English lessons which she gave to the neighbors' children.
The killing of Wilkin.
In 1943, Wilkin moved to serve in the police headquarters in Jerusalem as the head of the Jewish department. He lived on the compound of the Romanian Orthodox Church in Shivtei Israel (Twelve Tribes of Israel) street in Jerusalem, and the couple failed to meet as often as before, but their love was put to the test and they decided to get married.
Lehi continued to track Wilkin in Jerusalem in order to kill him in revenge for the murder of Yair Stern. On September 29, 1944 they assassinated Wilkin on the sidewalk in the heart of Jerusalem, near the Romanian Church. The news of his murder was told to Shoshana by a doctor and an officer who came to her home. Hearing the news, Shoshana fainted and the doctor gave her a tranquilizer.
Mandate authorities held Wilkin's at the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. It was attended by hundreds of police and government leaders, including Chief Secretary to the British High Commissioner for Palestine and Transjordan of the British Mandate, which was second to the High Commissioner, and Mandate Police Chief John Rymer-Jones. Among the people following his coffin was Shoshana. She watched the coffin with tears in her eyes. Arthur Frederick Giles, the Intelligence chief, approached her, expressed his sympathy and gave her a silver chain that was found among Wilkin things, and she wore it around her neck.
Life after Wilkin's death.
After Wilkin's death, Shoshana, who was mourning, got an invitation from Giles to come his bureau to meet with him. At the meeting, Giles suggested Shoshana go to England to meet Wilkin's parents. She agreed and the commander organized her trip. She arrived at his parents' town of Aldeburgh, where she met the parents and sister of Wilkin, and told them about her relationship with him. Wilkin's sister proposed that Shoshana stay and live with her in Aldborough, but she did not accept the offer and returned to Palestine.
In 1945, Shoshana married Arthur Strauss, a German Jew, born in 1901 who immigrated to Palestine in 1935. She met him while giving him private lessons in Hebrew. In 1948 they had a daughter, who married Shaul Mishal, and they had three children. In 1984, Arthur died. In her later years, Shoshana lived in a senior home in Karmiel. At the end of 2004, Shoshana passed away and was buried in Metula.

Ohotaq Mikkigak

Ohotaq (Oqutaq) Mikkigak (1936 - 2014) was a Cape Dorset (now Kinngait) based Inuk artist from southern Baffin Island. Mikkigak was involved with Cape Dorset printmaking in the program's early years, providing drawn designs for printing. Many of his works were printed and featured in the studio's annual collections, including "Eskimo Fox Trapper" and three pieces used in the Cape Dorset Studio's 40th anniversary collection. Mikkigak's work has also been included in of over twenty group exhibitions and was the subject of multiple solo exhibitions, including a show held by Feheley Fine Arts called "Ohotaq Mikkigak: Imagined Landscapes".
Career.
Formative years.
Mikkigak drew for the Cape Dorset printmaking program when it was in its early stages of operation. His first printed work, "Eskimo Fox Trapper," was realized in 1961. As the printmaking studio progressed, Mikkigak partially withdrew his participation, beginning to work full-time for numerous community-based agencies. Following his retirement from caretaking at the Peter Pitseolak School in Cape Dorset, Mikkigak returned to drawing, and three of his works were included in the Cape Dorset print studio's 40th anniversary collection (released in 1999). Three lithographed versions of his works used the chine collé technique, and were included in the Annual Print Collection of 2001. A print of Mikkigak's work called "Three Ravens" (2001-2005) was also included in 2001 catalogue for the West Baffin Eskimo Co-Operative (Kinngait Co-operative).
Later career.
Mikkigak's first solo exhibition of drawings and prints was held in September 2010 at Feheley Fine Arts in Toronto, Ontario. He had another solo show at Feheley Fine Arts in November 2012 called "Ohotaq Mikkigak: Imagined Landscapes." Also in 2012, Mikkigak exhibited several large-scale drawings alongside the works of fellow Canadian artist Jack Bush at the Justina M. Barnicke Gallery at the University of Toronto. Mikkigak's other group exhibitions include:
Collections.
Mikkigak's work is featured in several collections including:
Major influences.
Mikkigak's time hunting on the land and stories from his grandmother highly influenced his work. It is noted that he did not look to colonial artists or art history for artistic inspiration. It has been observed that Inuit artists of Mikkigak's period drew significant inspiration from the apprenticeship structure of Arctic co-ops (such as the Cape Dorset printmaking studio). While Mikkigak was a practicing artist, he worked with James Houston and others based out of the Cape Dorsert (Kinngait) printmaking studio's first location, a government-issued building known as the "sanaguavik". Houston was known for encouraging Inuit artists to draw based on their "isumanniivit" (their own thoughts), which is likely to have influenced Mikkigak's work.
Style.
Mikkigak's work covered a board spectrum of subjects and themes, and was often done in pencil crayon (a medium that was particularly prevalent among Inuit graphic artists). Mikkigak's work also consistently emphasized the sky and weather patterns, often using an aerial view for the composition. It was common for artists, including Mikkigak, to use Inuktitut syllabics at the bottom of a piece in order to explain the scene in detail, as well as to use larger formats and manipulate scale in order to convey the Arctic landscape's expansiveness. A theme in Mikkigak and other Inuit artists' work is the use of landscapes to represent memories connected to the represented land, rather than purely the reality of the scene depicted. Mikkigak's drawings did not seek to abstract the landscape, despite his later images taking on a more contemporary style and tone. Instead, he took inspiration from both imagined and real spaces in order to represent their expansive and all-encompassing nature, while focalizing Northern Canada as a fertile rather than barren landscape of colour and open space. He is noted for his autobiographical illustrations, and has said that he enjoyed making drawings filled with colour; especially landscapes, and scenes using animals (particularly birds) and people.
Personal life.
Mikkigak was married to Qaunak Mikkigak (sometimes spelled Haunak or Qaunak), an Inuk throat singer and carver. They lived the traditional Inuit lifestyle together before settling in Cape Dorset.

Gary M. Olson

Gary M. Olson, Ph.D. (born 24 December 1944) is a professor and researcher, specializing in the fields of human-computer interaction and computer supported cooperative work. He has published over 120 research articles and book chapters, and is one of the authors of "Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet" (Morgan &amp; Claypool, 2014)"."
Education.
Olson received his B.A. in psychology from the University of Minnesota in 1967. He received his M.A. in 1968 and Ph.D. in 1970, both in psychology from Stanford University.
Career and research.
Olson became an assistant professor of psychology at the University of Michigan in 1975, was promoted to associate professor in 1977, and professor in 1984. He first became interested in human-computer interaction in the early 1980s, and played a large part in developing the human-computer interaction program at the University of Michigan. He joined the School of Information as a professor and associate dean for research in 1995, and was named the Paul M. Fitts Collegiate Professor of Human-Computer Interaction in 2001, which was his position until 2008, when he became the Donald Bren Professor of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Irvine.
Olson has placed a focus on collaborative technologies and long-distance work throughout his career. In 2000, Olson and his wife Judith S. Olson published the notable and highly cited paper "Distance Matters""," that reviews over a decade of research on collaborative technologies for remote work, details some of the challenges of long-distance collaborative work through the technologies found in these studies, and provides potential ways to maximize the chance of succeeding at remote work. Olson has also published several edited books, most notably "Scientific collaboration on the Internet" (MIT Press, 2008) which includes chapters from several experts in the field of internet collaboration, as well as several case studies of large-scale collaborative projects. In 2014, Olson and his wife Judith S. Olson published their coauthored book "Working Together Apart: Collaboration over the Internet" (Morgan &amp; Claypool, 2014), which is a review of their research on technology used for long distance collaboration"."
In 2015, Olson was a member of a team that published a research paper on a tool called DocuViz, which visualizes the revision history of Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides documents. The team analyzed over 100 documents using the tool, finding patterns in collaborative writing and potential use cases for the tool. In several recent articles that Olson has had a part in writing, such as "How People Write Together Now: Beginning the Investigation with Advanced Undergraduates in a Project Course" in March 2017 and "Now that we can write simultaneously, how do we use that to our advantage?" in July 2017, Olson has continued to investigate and discuss collaborative word processors and the ways that they can potentially be used most effectively.
Olson retired in December 2016, but is still active in research. He is currently an Emeritus Professor at both University of California, Irvine and the University of Michigan.
Achievements.
In 2003, Olson was elected to the CHI Academy.
In 2006, Olson, along with his wife Judith S. Olson, received the SIGCHI Lifetime Achievement Award.
In 2007, he was elected to ACM Fellows for his contributions to computer-supported collaborative work"."
In 2009, he was named an APS Fellow for his work in the cognitive field.
In 2010, he was named an APA Fellow.
In 2016, he received the SIGCHI Lifetime Service Award.

Francesca Llopis

Francesca Llopis (Barcelona, 1956) is a visual artist from Barcelona. She began exhibiting in 1981. Her works are based and focused on her travels and on nature, mainly working on painting, drawing and video installations and collaborating with other artists such as Barbara Held and Robert Waytt. "Painting, drawing and image in movement are the basis and the main instrumental from which arises the system where I start any proposal".
She has participated in some exhibitions in Spain, France, Switzerland, the United States, Italy, Germany, Korea, China, Colombia, Argentina, Brazil, Taiwan, and Japan.
Style.
Her trajectory and pictorial work begins with the architecture and the influences of the Neo-expressionism movement of the 80s, which serve her to represent the urban culture. She is interested in the city for its urban planning, the city seen from above, and that is why she often uses the labyrinth as a metaphor for defining the city.
Her influences come, mainly, from the abstract expressionism of the American painting and from artists such as Louise Bourgeois, Judy Chicago, Meret Oppenheim, Nancy Spero and Eva Hesse.
Her latest works, of a more poetic and political nature, are made to be the viewer who completes them.
Artistic and professional career.
In 1976 Francesca Llopis enrolles at escola EINA where she meets Dani Freixes, , Albert Ràfols-Casamada, Maria Girona and Manel Esclusa, among others. Between 1979 and 1981 she shares an interior design studio with Josep Maria Civit and Ton Auquer and obtains an artistic residence grant at the Teater Studio in the Pałac Kultury in Warsaw. The inevitable and foreseeable "coup d'etat" transforms and creates a new pictorial imaginary to the artist, making her to question the lyrical abstraction of her first stage. From this inflection point, the "trip" will constitute a fundamental part of her process in the artistic work. Between 1983 and 1986, she begins her professional career: "Història d'una temptació" (History of a temptation) at MedaMOTHI in Montpellier, "Barcelona trasbalsada" (Barcelona overwhelmed) at Metronome and "Els dits gèlids" (The Frozen fingers) at Maeght gallery, in Barcelona, and "Tráfico de efectos" (Traffic of effects) at Montenegro gallery in Madrid. In 1988, she has an artist's residence at the Accademia di Roma and at the , where Arnau Puig defines her painting as "semantic structuralism" in reference to her obsession with the built space and the meaning of words. In 2002 she presents her first video installation "2 habitacions amb vistes" (2 rooms with views), a social portrait of Barcelona. In 2004 she develops ETC as a work in progress to discuss the absence of women artists in the history of art. In 2009, a new pictorial stage begins where inks and notebooks are assembled randomly, rising to different artistic artefacts, films and murals. In 2015, she participates in the Biennial of Noseden (Art line), in Japan, with Dealers of memory, which consists of two interventions: the video installation "Apunts per un iceberg" (Notes for an iceberg), in the Kurokawana school and the installation "Llibre de llàgrimes" (Book of tears) in the Myoken temple where she relates the intimate and the public, the original and the Universe. In 2016, in the SakaiArtePorto exhibition in Japan, she makes the installation Traction action from joining humanity to the Universe through an infinity made with pink pigmental footprints from the city's walkers. She makes a residence on performance at Art in Nature in Busan, Korea. In 2017, she presents the installation "Llum!" (Light!) with neon and glass at Montjuïc Castle in Barcelona, as a reflection of historical memory, the performance us &amp; the state of things in Köln, Barcelona and other places, and Big Draw at Picasso Museum in Barcelona with "Insecta'm" and "Enjardina't" (Insect me and Garden yourself).

Sylar (band)

Sylar is an American rock band formed in Queens, New York City, New York in 2011. The band members formed from various bands in the New York City post-hardcore scene, and take their name from the "Heroes" villain Sylar. The band is part of the NYHC movement, and currently consists of vocalist Jayden Panesso, rhythm guitarist/clean vocalist Miguel Cardona, lead guitarist Dustin Jennings, bassist Travis Hufton, and drummer Cody Ash.
History.
Sylar formed in Queens, New York in 2011, with Jayden Panesso and Thomas Veroutis after the two future band members connected on social media. The band has been described as creating a sound as if they use the studio "like an extra instrument... heavily produced and processed, with angular edits and heavily gated guitars creating an almost mechanical sound." Shortly after their formation, they released their debut EP with "Cutting The Ties" in 2011. The band were signed to Razor &amp; Tie records in 2013. Their production sound is heavily inspired by Caleb Shomo of Beartooth and Attack Attack! who helped produce their second EP, "Deadbeat", in 2013, and their debut album, "To Whom It May Concern", in 2014. In 2016 the band released their second studio album, "Help!", on Hopeless Records, which was followed by the release of three singles "Assume", "Dark Daze" and "Soul Addiction". Their third album, "Seasons", was released on October 5, 2018.
Musical style and influences.
In an interview with Dead Press, the members of the band cited Bring Me the Horizon's Sempiternal, Deftones's eponymous fourth album, Slipknot's Iowa, Atreyu's the Curse and Poison's Open Up and Say... Ahh! as their biggest musical influences. They have been categorised as nu metalcore, metalcore and nu metal.

Domnach Airgid

The Domnach Airgid (or Domhnach Airgid, English: Silver Church, or Shrine of Saint Patrick's Gospels) is an 8th-century Irish wooden reliquary that was considerably reworked between the 13th and 15th centuries and became a cumdach or "book shrine", when its basic timber structure was reinforced and decorated by elaborate silver-gilt metalwork. Its front-piece was enhanced by gilded relief showing Jesus in "Arma Christi" (with Instruments of the Passion), alongside depictions of saints, angels and clerics, in scenes imbued with complex iconography. It is thus considered a mixture of the early Insular and later International Gothic styles.
The Domnach Airgid is one of the few extant Irish shrines thought to have held non-Irish relics. When opened in the 19th century, the shrine was found to hold badly decayed leaves from a 6th-9th century manuscript recounting the Gospels written in Vulgate Latin. Thirty-nine pages of the manuscript survive, each measuring about nine inches in height. Based on the inscriptions, it is thought to be one of the earliest surviving depictions of apostles portrayed with their attributes and Instruments of the Passion. It has been in the National Museum of Ireland (Kildare Street site) in Dublin since 1847. There is an early 20th century replica in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
The earliest records title the shrine as "Domnach" (pronounced "Donagh"), a word derived from the Latin "Dominicus" ("Belonging to God" or "of the Master"). The antiquarian and painter George Petrie (1790–1866) was one of the first to describe the Domnach Airgid, and strongly believed the early medieval box was created as a host for relics, and only later became decorative shrine and container for Gospel manuscripts.
Description.
The Domnach Airgid is oblong in shape, and is 23cm high, 16.7cm wide and 9.8cm long. It contains three covers, each build during separate phases. The inner-most is made of Yew-wood and dates to the early medieval period, when the object was built to hold relics and portions of a Gospel. The middle cover dates from the 14th century and is made of tinned copper-alloy plates lined with sliver, while the 15th century outer cover is formed from silver plated with gold.
Early medieval casket.
The original early medieval casket was built to hold relics, and is dated to either the late eighth or early ninth century. It consisted of a single yew-wood chamber with a sliding door, and was covered with tinned bronze plates decorated with interlace. The original plates on the sides of the shire are still visible.
It is traditionally associated with Patrick and believed to have been in his possession and sanctified by him before he presented or gave it to St Macartan (454—506), the first Bishop of Clogher in County Tyrone. This story is first mentioned in a 7th-century vita of St. Patrick, in which the shrine is named as the Domnach Airgid. The original casket may have been referred to in the 10th century "Tripartite Life of St Patrick", which mentions gifts made to him, including relics of the Apostles, portions of the True Cross, and tufts of Mary's hair, or the Holy Sepulchre. Historians believe that such relics would have been collected during trips by Irish clergy to Rome.
14 and 15th century plates.
The shrine was significantly remodeled around 1350 under the commission of John O’Carbri, abbot of Clones, County Monaghan. The work was completed by the Clones craftsman and goldsmith John (Eoin) Ó'Bárdáin, whose signature () is engraved on the shrine. Ó'Bárdáin is known to have lived in Drogheda, and modernised its appearance in the contemporary International Gothic style, including the covering of the earlier wood shrine with tin-lined bronze panels decorated with interlace knots. O’Carbri likely had political motivations for commissioning the redesign in the context of the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The Normans sought to undermine the established order, in part via an attack on Irish Christianity, in an effort to detach the island from its Celtic heritage. In response, some clerics fought back by refurbishing and restoring early medieval sacred objects in order to reinforce the island's cultural identity.
During the first phase of reworking, the front plate (frontpiece) was replaced with four rectangular, silver gilt panels. A full-length, high-relief ("alto-relievo") representation of the crucified Jesus positioned between these panels forms its center point. The Holy Spirit, shown in the form of a dove enamelled in gold, hovers above his head. A small, square reliquary decorated with crystal is positioned above the dove, and is presumed to have once held what its owners believed was a fragment of the true cross. The four panels around Jesus contain eleven smaller, ornately and delicately figures carved in low-relief ("basso-rilievo"), They depict saints and clerics dressed in clothes that draw from both early medieval Irish and European gothic styles. The upper left hand panel shows the Archangel Michael and the Virgin and Child depicted in the Nursing Madonna ("Virgo Lactans") style. In the panel to their right a unidentified figure wears a broad brimmed hat and holds what may be palms. He stands alongside saints Paul and Peter. The scribe in the lower right panel, who may represent St Patrick, presents a cumdach, seemingly the Domnach Airgid itself, to St Macartan. Above Jesus's head is a squared shaped hollow space intended as a holding space, which historians such as Rachel Moss view as possibly intended to hold a "passion relic" of the True Cross. Above that again is an enameled heraldic shield, decorated with a rock crystal, a precious stone that was rarity in Ireland at the time.
The wider two of the sides contain a three plates also adorned with figures of saints. A cross added in 15th century to the rear panel depicts the three Magi. Other additions by craftsmen during this refurbishment include three circular mounds on the top plate, each of which were set with quartz crystals, though one is now lost. A number of other figures, including running animals and zoomorphic grotesques, some with unusually large jaws and bulbus eyes, were placed on small mounts at the borders and corners of the frontpiece. The dove hovering above Christ's head was also added during this rework.
Manuscript.
The folios of an eight or ninth century illuminated manuscript were found within the shrine when it was opened in 1832 by the antiquarian William Betham. The manuscript reproduced a Gospel written in Vulgate Latin, and inscribed with Irish majuscule script. The book is severely damaged, with just 39 extant leaves intact, of which some have become detached from their casing. It is today catalogued as MS. 24. Q. 23.
Provenance.
Over the centuries, the Domnach Airgid was kept in various religious houses and by local families in the Clogher and Clones region. It is though to have been owned by "The Lord of Enniskillen", who was likely a member of the Maguire family executed following the Irish Rebellion of 1641. It is first mentioned in modern literature by John Groves in 1819, when it was then kept as private heir-loom in Brookeborough, County Fermanagh. In 1832 it was purchased by the Dublin bookseller George Smith, before it was acquired by the Anglo-Irish peer, Henry Westenra. 
Petrie described the shrine detail c. 1835-39, and in 1896 John Bernard published a detailed paper on the manuscript. In 1918 Edmund Armstrong and H. J. Lawlor provided in-depth descriptions and accounts of its symbolism provenance for the Clogher Diocesan Register, and their work is still considered largely definitive. It was acquired by the National Museum of Ireland in 1847 from the collection of Petrie, shortly after his death. It was acquired during a period of refocus and acquisition by the museum (as they put it "judicious purchasing"), in part influenced by the antiquities dealer Redmond Anthony's (1768-1848) collection of Irish medieval jewelry and decorative art works. The museum's new directive sought to bring from private to public collections works of national historical significance such the Cross of Cong (a donation from 1839) and the Ardagh Hoard (acquired 1874), that had languished merely as curiosity pieces.
Condition.
Due to its age, the Domnach Airgid is in poor condition. Areas of the gilding contain accumulations of dirt, and any colourisation has long since faded, leading to its current dark appearance of mostly brown and black hues. The metal works between the front piece plates are disjointed, while the back end is mostly lost, with just the bronze sheet, which may be early, remaining exant. Petrie said that the order of some of the figures was changed during a then recent repair of the front cover. However he had an earlier drawing of the shrine, from which he based some of his descriptions.

Airy Mount

Airy Mount, near Versailles, Kentucky, is a historic site dating from 1796 with Georgian architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.
It is notable for its mural painted by French immigrant "Alfred Cohen, who left Marseilles, France, with two brothers in the 1820s and settled in Midway, in the northeast corner of Woodford County. The three houses concerned are the only ones known anywhere to have been painted with murals by Cohen, a primitive artist who had little, if any, formal training. Although these landscape scenes show disregard for correct scale and perspective, they possess charm through the artist's lack of inhibitions."
It is a "substantial residence, built in several stages, .. located one mile north of McCowan's Ferry Road in rural Woodford County. Appropriately named, the house is situated on the summit of a low, wide rise, and has a commanding view of the gently rolling landscape in all directions. The earliest portion, constructed ca. 1796, includes the western three bays of the
central two-story block."
The other two houses with Cohen murals are Wyndehurst and Pleasant Lawn, both also NRHP-listed.

Ermenrichs Tod

Ermenrichs Tod or Koninc Ermenrîkes Dôt (the death of king Ermenrich) is an anonymous Middle Low German heroic ballad from the middle of the sixteenth century. It is a late attestation of Germanic heroic legend.
The ballad, which is printed in a highly garbled form, tells the story of how Ermenrich is killed by Dietrich von Bern and several other heroes. The poem shows numerous similarities to older stories about Ermenrich attested in early medieval and Old Norse sources.
Summary.
According to the song, Dietrich wants to exile the King of the Franks, "van Armentriken", because the latter wants to hang Dietrich. As one of his companions Dietrich receives the gigantic King Blödelinck, who is only twelve years old and is the son of a Frankish widow. Dietrich then sets off to "Freysack" who the enemy king lives, passing by a set of gallows. He and his companions disguise themselves as dancers and receive an audience with the king before revealing themselves and demanding to know why the king wants to hang Dietrich. When the king is silent, Dietrich cuts off his head and then the twelve proceed to kill everyone in the castle except for Reinholt von Meilan, who is spared due to his loyalty to the king. Blödelinck has disappeared in the fighting and Dietrich assumes he is dead, but the giant reappears.
Printing.
The ballad was originally printed as a broadside titled Van Dirick van dem Berne (concerning Dietrich von Bern) in 1535/45 or 1560 together with another ballad "Juncker Baltzer" in Lübeck, and was printed again in a Low German songbook from 1590 or 1600. The broadside is heavily corrupted—possibly the work of a printer famous for his mistakes, Johannes Balhorn the Elder—and not always comprehensible. Victor Millet suggests that it was printed in honor of King Christian II of Denmark, who returned from exile in the Netherlands at this time. Elisabeth Lienert finds this interpretation questionable, however notes that "Juncker Baltzer", the text printed alongside "Ermenrichs Tod", is clearly about Christian.
Metrical form.
The ballad is printed in the so-called "Hildebrandston," a stanzaic metrical form named about another heroic ballad, the "Jüngeres Hildebrandslied". No melody has been transmitted with the text, but it was likely meant to be sung. The stanza consists of four "Langzeilen," lines consisting of three metrical feet, a caesura, and three additional metrical feet. Unlike the similar stanza used in the "Nibelungenlied", in the "Hildebrandston" all four lines are of the same length. The lines rhyme in couplets, with occasional rhymes across lines at the caesura. An example is the first stanza of the poem as contained in the first printed edition:
Relation to the oral tradition.
Although the text is very late and at times not clear, it nevertheless contains many references to events in the oral tradition about Ermenrich that are otherwise only found in allusions or Scandinavian sources. Lienert notes that it is possible that the ballad comes from a tradition in which Dietrich successfully returns from exile and avenges himself on his wicked uncle. Joachim Heinzle suspects that many of the mistakes come from the composer of the ballad only partially remembering the heroic tradition. "Van Armentriken" is clearly the legendary Ermenrich, with his name misunderstood as the name of his country. His misidentification as King of the Franks/France may be connected to a note by Johannes Agricola in which a king "Ermentfrid" (that is, Ermenrich) of the Franks supposedly conquered Lombardy and there killed his nephews known as the Harlungen. Blödelinck is Blödel, i.e. Bleda, Attila's brother, who also appears in the Nibelungenlied and the historical Dietrich poems. "Freysack" is probably Breisach, which was connected with the Harlungen from an early date. Lastly, Ermenrich's death is reminiscent of the Svanhild episode recorded in the Poetic Edda and other sources, as the sons of Jónakr also pass by a set of gallows on their way to confront Jörmunrekkr. Dietrich's involvement may be a variant of his return from exile – in a variant of the text, it is even said that Ermenrich wanted to drive Dietrich away, not the other way around. Despite the many apparent connections to the oral tradition, Millet believes that it is useless to use "Ermenrichs Tod" to reconstruct legends about Ermenrich.

Redout (video game)

Redout is a futuristic racing video game developed and published by Italian studio 34BigThings, and co-published by Nicalis and 505 Games.It is inspired by racing games such as "F-Zero", "Wipeout", "Rollcage", and "POD" as stated on the game page on Steam.
The game was released on Microsoft Windows on September 2, 2016, while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One got a late August, 2017 release. The Nintendo Switch port was originally slated for a Spring 2017 release, but got delayed and was re-announced for a May 14, 2019 release.
Gameplay.
Redout is an anti-gravity racing game set in 2560 where players compete in the SRRL (Solar Redout Racing League) by piloting one of a selection of crafts on several different tracks.
There are seven racing teams and every team has four ships. Each ship has its distinct characteristics of acceleration, top speed, grip, structural integrity, energy pool and energy recharge speed. The players can customize their ship's characteristics installing upgrades and choosing a passive and active powerup of the six of each available.
There are five racing complexes (and an additional seven have been added via DLC) each one consisting of five tracks. Track design includes loops, jumps, teleports, underwater sections, tubular sections and tracks with low or no gravity.
The game features different racing modes of which the most unusual one is the boss mode, a race on a very long track obtained by linking via teleports the five tracks of a racing complex. Multiplayer is supported online via lobbies of up to twelve players and locally via two players split-screen.
The ship controls are similar to that of aircraft, including strafing and pitching the vehicle; the latter is used when turning uphill to prevent the ship from grinding the floor (slowing and damaging the craft) and when turning downhill to prevent redouts (an aesthetic effect).

Messines Ridge British Cemetery

Messines Ridge British Cemetery is a Commonwealth War Graves Commission burial ground for the dead of the First World War located in the Ypres Salient in Belgium on the Western Front.
History.
The town of Messines, now known as Mesen, was the location of a number of battles during the First World War, beginning when it was captured by German forces in late October-early November 1914. Later in the war, it formed the southern corner of the Ypres Salient and in June 1917, the New Zealand Division drove the Germans out in the Battle of Messines, taking 3,700 casualties in the process. In March 1918, it was lost to the Germans in the Spring Offensive and returned to Allied control again in September 1918, when it was seized during the Hundred Days Offensive.
Foundation.
Messines Ridge British Cemetery was established after the First World War for the remains of soldiers collected from several smaller cemeteries in the area. These included the Bell Farm Cemetery, Blauwepoortebeek Cemetery, Bousbecques East German Cemetery, Bristol Castle Military Cemetery, Lumm Farm Cemetery, Middle Farm Cemetery, Onraet Farm Cemetery, Queensland Cemetery and the River Douve Cemetery. Most of these cemeteries held men that were killed in the period from June to December 1917. One, the Bousbecques East German Cemetery, held four British soldiers that had died in November 1914 while the Bristol Castle Military Cemetery dated from September–October 1918.
Cemetery.
The cemetery, designed by the English architect Charles Holden and located on the Mesen-Wulvergem Road, to the west of Mesen, holds the remains of 1,493 Allied soldiers, over half of whom are unknown. It was established on land that formerly belonged to the 'Institution Royale'.
Within the cemetery are special memorials to several soldiers who are believed to be among the unknown remains buried at the cemetery; four British, ten Australian, thirteen New Zealanders and one South African. In addition, there are special memorials to thirteen British soldiers buried in other cemeteries in the area during the war but whose graves were destroyed by artillery fire. In total, 1,534 soldiers are buried or remembered at the cemetery.
Bodies continue to be occasionally discovered in the area and are often interred at the cemetery; one was found while digging a pipeline and was formally interred on 25 February 2013. Although the identity of the soldier was not known, he was believed to be a New Zealander, as badges and paraphernalia from the New Zealand Rifle Brigade was found with his remains. This followed another interment of an unknown New Zealander the previous year.
Messines Ridge (New Zealand) Memorial.
The cemetery also includes the New Zealand Memorial to the Missing, also designed by Holden, in memory of 840 soldiers of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force killed in the area and who have no known grave. The memorial, at the entrance to the cemetery, takes the form of a Cross of Sacrifice on a circular base about which are provided panels with the names of the missing, including that of the All Black George Sellars, killed during the Battle of Messines.

Anatolie Popa

Anatolie Popa (, "Anatoliy Vasilievich Popa"; March 15, 1896 – June 25, 1920) was a Bessarabian-born military commander active during World War I and the Russian Revolution and Civil War, one of the organisers of the Moldavian armed resistance against the advancing Romanian troops in January 1918.
Biography.
Early life and the Russian Revolution.
Anatolie Popa was born into a poor peasant family in Cotiujenii Mari, in the Soroksky Uyezd of the Bessarabia Governorate. After primary education in his home village and Vadul-Rașcov, he enrolled in the Bălți municipal school. However, as his family was unable to cope with the high fees, he dropped out before graduating. Nevertheless, with the low literacy rate in Bessarabia, at 15 Popa was able to get a job as secretary of the rural police in his home village. This provided him with an occasion to become acquainted with the anti-Tsarist literature, mainly through the students returning home during the holidays.
With the start of World War I, Popa was drafted in the Imperial Russian Army and, after graduating the Odessa War College as an officer, he was sent to the Eastern Front. He was supportive of the overthrow of the Tsar during the February Revolution, and his political views were further influenced by the strong Bolshevik agitation in the 49th Technical Reserve Battalion in Odessa, where he was recovering from a battlefield injury. Popa was eventually put in command of a battalion of the 75th Sevastopol Infantry Regiment and in September 1917 was dispatched to Chișinău, the Bessarabian administrative centre.
Popa soon joined the Moldavian national movement, which sought autonomy for Bessarabia, and was appointed a delegate to the Moldavian Central Military Executive Committee. The movement for autonomy, spearheaded by the Moldavian National Party (MNP), was regarded with suspicion not only by the ethnic minorities, but also by the leftist revolutionary committees and the Moldavian peasant majority, who feared autonomy was a step towards annexation to the neighbouring conservative Kingdom of Romania. The October Revolution, however, led to a mood change amongst the more moderate leftist groups, and in November 1917 the various revolutionary committees coagulated into a provisional provincial assembly, "Sfatul Țării", which on proclaimed the autonomous Moldavian Democratic Republic within a Russian Democratic Federative Republic.
The assembly, proclaiming itself the highest authority in Bessarabia, appointed a provisional executive, the "Council of Directors"; furthermore, it nominally pledged allegiance to the Provisional Government, placing itself in tacit opposition to the provincial and Chișinău city Soviets of workers' and soldiers' deputies, which had recognised the Bolshevik Council of People's Commissars ("Sovnarkom") at the end of November. As the latter commanded the allegiance of most regular troops of the Russian Army in Bessarabia, increasingly Bolshevik in outlook, the "Council of Directors" sought to enlist the Moldavian militias in an effort to create an Armed Force loyal to "Sfatul Țării". Anatolie Popa was among the officers chosen for this task and, on , he received the command of the "nationalised" Moldavian 478th detachment of Bălți. Popa was also appointed military commissioner for the Bălți county, growing close to the local Council of peasants' deputies. The state of emergency was soon declared in the Bălți county "in order to preserve public order", however Popa was reticent in using violence against the peasants. On , the "Council"'s Military Director had to request the Commissioner for Moldavian Problems in Odessa to order Popa to comply with the directions issued by the local commissioner and commander of the garrison.
Romanian intervention and defence of Bălți.
The authority of "Sfatul Țării" was not universally recognised across Bessarabia; instead, several local committees, some loyal to the "Sovnarkom", exercised authority locally. The most serious contender was the Chișinău City Soviet, which, radicalised by the Ukrainian Rada's demobilisation order, had elected a mostly Bolshevik executive committee in mid-December. The Soviet and the "Council" still collaborated in managing the demobilisation, however they were unable to cope with the disruption caused by the large number of disorganised, badly fed soldiers leaving the front. Confronted with widespread peasant rioting and the unreliability of Moldavian troops, which were also siding with the Bolsheviks, a closed session of "Sfatul Țării" authorised the "Council of Directors" to look for military support outside the province: the leftist leaders, Ion Inculeț and Pantelimon Erhan, held talks with the chief of the Odessa Military District, while the nationalist MNP sought assistance from the Romanian government in Iași. By , rumours of an imminent foreign military intervention had spread in Chișinău, prompting the Moldavian Military Central Executive Committee, the City Soviet and the provincial Peasants' Council to issue protests, affirming their commitment to the revolution and a federal Russia, and calling for redistributing land to peasants, purging the "reactionary" elements in "Sfatul Țării" and establishing relations with the "Sovnarkom". In spite of reassurances coming from the leaders of "Sfatul Țării" that only "neutral" troops would be brought, the provincial and Chișinău City soviets took steps toward strengthening their positions. On they established a "Revolutionary Headquarters", proclaimed the highest authority over all "Soviet" troops in Bessarabia, and soon they enlisted the support of the frontline department ("Frontotdel") of the Rumcherod, which had arrived to Chișinău at the end of December.
The "Council of Directors" also ultimately decided on to request military assistance from General Dmitry Shcherbachev, the nominal head of Russian troops on the Romanian front; the general, who had no effective authority over the troops, forwarded the request to the Romanians. Several leaders of the Nationalist Party would later testify this was the intended course of events, the "Council" fearing a direct call for Romanian troops would result in a popular revolt. The request precipitated a Bolshevik takeover, as, on , the "Frontotdel" proclaimed itself the supreme authority over all troops in Bessarabia and took control of the mail, telegraph and main railway stations in Bessarabia. The authority of "Sfatul Țării", declared an "organ of the bourgeoisie", was virtually dissolved. In this context, the Romanian army moved in into Bessarabia in early January and occupied several towns and villages along the Prut, encountering only light resistance from local pro-Soviet troops. The first major encounter took place in Chișinău on , when Moldavian and Russian troops disarmed troops of the Transylvanian volunteer corps sent by the Romanian government to take the city. Later that day, Erhan and Inculeț, summoned at a joint meeting of the provincial and City soviets with the Moldavian Military Central Executive Committee, denied any role in the Romanian invasion, repudiated the MNP directors, and even agreed to send a protest note to the Romanian government, calling for a withdrawal of its troops. The mood among the Moldavian troops was also strongly anti-Romanian, and Erhan and the Military Director, Gherman Pântea, were forced to authorise resistance; however, as the main corps of the Romanian army approached Chișinău on , Pântea directed most Moldavian troops in the opposite direction in order to avert a battle. While the initial Romanian forays into the Bessarabian capital were repulsed with difficulties by the Russian and Moldavian troops, the "Frontodel" and the City Soviet, faced with a numerically superior opponent, ultimately decided to withdraw towards Bender, and the Romanians occupied Chișinău on .
The news of the Romanian invasion quickly reached the rest of Bessarabia, and resistance was prepared, most notably in Bălți and Bender. On , on the initiative of the Bălți County commissioner Vasile Rudiev, the county's Council of Peasants' Deputies began organising a resistance to the Romanian advance. The Council declared a general mobilisation and established the "Revolutionary Headquarters for the Defence of the Country", comprising Andrei Paladi, chairman of the county's Land Committee, G. Galagan, member of the Provincial Peasant's Council executive committee, Rudiev, and others. Already on the 22nd, the "Revolutionary Headquarters" was able to muster 3,000 workers and soldiers of the local garrison, who held a rally also attended by delegates from nearby villages. The mobilisation was not however supported by all the committees: the Bălți Municipal Council rejected it on January, refused to send delegates to the "Revolutionary Headquarters" and event requested its dissolution. Its delegates to the joint session of the Peasants' Council, the Municipal Council, the Workers' and Soldiers' Soviet and the county zemstvo were even able to obtain a slight majority against armed resistance. According to his own account, the chairman of the local Soviet, the Menshevik Razumovskyi, also attempted to delay the mobilisation, arguing that a hastily armed crowd would not be able to resist a regular army; however, his attempts to persuade the session of the Peasants' Council were received with jeers. In spite of such opposition, Rudiev and Popa, who replaced the former in the "Revolutionary Headquarters", handed out weapons to volunteers in the city and nearby villages and ensured that the two artillery pieces available to the garrison were properly manned. According to a witness interrogated by the Romanians after taking the city, the local Revolutionary Committee, led by sub-lieutenant Solovyov, requested Popa to hand in the weapons from the garrison, threatening him with death; another witness however indicated that Popa acted on its own accord, handing out weapons personally, in collaboration with other members of the "Revolutionary Headquarters". Popa also took into custody several Romanian officers arrested in the countryside, and rejected Razumovskyi's plea for their release, stating he was acting in retaliation to the arrest of Moldavian officers in Ungheni.
The Second Congress of the Bălți County Peasants' deputies, held on , voted to reject the authority of "Sfatul Țării" as unrepresentative, pledged allegiance to the Bolshevik "Sovnarkom" and called for the institution of Soviet power. Furthermore, the Congress rejected Bessarabia's separation from Soviet Russia and decided to send Paladi to Petrograd to request for military assistance against the Romanian intervention. The call for an end to the Romanian intervention was initially joined by the Third Bessarabian Peasants' Congress, assembled in Chișinău on and presided by Rudiev. However, as the latter city had already been occupied by Romanian troops, the radical leaders of the Congress were arrested and executed shortly after; a more complacent leadership was installed and renounced overt opposition to the Romanian military occupation. According to the pro-Romanian politician Dimitrie Bogos, Popa also attended the Provincial Congress in Chișinău on the , where he sided with the initial majority, and only afterwards returned to Bălți and began organising the resistance against the Romanian army.
Popa also contacted Gherman Pântea, the acting Director for the military of the provisional Bessarabian executive, requesting information about the situation in Chișinău. According to the transcript of their exchange, Popa had managed to enlist an infantry battalion, two cavalry squadrons, a machine-gun company, a motor transport company, as well as an artillery battery. Noting that the population was outraged by the Romanian intervention and the Peasants' Council had switched allegiance to the Petrograd government, he requested more officers and money for the soldiers' pay, and offered to send ammunitions and even troops to Chișinău. In his reply, Pântea repeated the Romanian argument that their intervention was only meant to protect the supply depots and pacify the capital, and expressed his distrust of the Bolshevik government. However, he also noted the Moldavian troops' dissatisfaction with the Romanian presence and affirmed his commitment to a republican Bessarabia "alongside Russia". Furthermore, Pântea informed Popa about his intention to resign from the executive, as the latter was becoming increasingly pro-Romanian, as well as his decision to mobilise the Moldavian Army to defend the country in case "someone looks over the Prut", towards the Romanian government.
Between , Moldavian and Russians troops, led by the "Revolutionary Headquarters", defended Bălți against the Romanian offensive. The defenders of the city, comprising up to a thousand volunteers and the revolutionary troops in the garrison, were also joined by armed peasants from Cubolta, Hăsnășenii Mici and other nearby villages. The initial advance of the Romanian 1st Cavalry Division commanded by general Mihail Schina was temporarily repulsed with losses at Fălești, with the general himself briefly captured by a peasants self-defense group in Obreja on . The same day the Romanians attempted to enter the city, but, coming under machine gun and artillery fire, they retreated with heavy losses; another Romanian cavalry detachment was repulsed near the railway station. Superior both in number of troops and artillery, the Romanian troops were ultimately able to defeat the revolutionary detachments and capture the town in the afternoon of , with part of the defenders retreating toward the north. Soviet sources also indicate the counter-revolutionary forces acting inside Bălți as a factor in the defeat. The Romanian occupation forces immediately began a crackdown on the resistance, with 20 locals executed and more than one thousand arrested in the following two days. Anatolie Popa was also apprehended on the occasion and, on , was sentenced to death by a Court Martial for his role in organising and arming the local troops. The assessment of the battle was mixed: while the Soviet historiography praised the "Defence of Bălți" as a heroic deed, Bogos saw the battle as an "infamy" comparable to the events of January 6, when Moldavian troops in Chișinău disarmed the Transylvanian volunteer corps. As argued by historian Izeaslav Levit, the opponents of the Romanian intervention included people of different ethnic backgrounds and political options: while the chairman of the local Soviet, the Ukrainian lieutenant Soloviev, collaborated with the "Revolutionary Headquarters" chiefly in order to prevent its takeover by the Bolsheviks, the Moldavians Rudiev and Popa were primarily supporters of the Moldavian autonomy and of peasants' interest, pushed into collaboration with the Bolsheviks by what they saw as their betrayal by the right wing of the "Sfatul Țării".
Russian Civil War and death.
Owing to Popa's good standing with the Bessarabian population, the Romanian authorities sought to co-opt him in their administration; consequently, he was soon pardoned by King Ferdinand and offered a position in the Romanian Army. Anatol Popa however took the occasion and fled over the Dniester, to Ukraine, joining the Soviet partisan groups. Given a command position, he led a partisan detachment that crossed the Dniester back into Bessarabia during the Khotyn Uprising in January 1919. After the Romanian Army violently suppressed the rebellion, he returned to Ukraine, where his group engaged troops loyal to the Directorate.
By April 1919, Popa was appointed commander of the first infantry regiment of the 1st Bessarabian brigade, led by Filip Levenson. This Red Army unit included many participants in the Khotyn Uprising, and was later redesignated as a Special Bessarabian Brigade and in June was integrated into the newly organised 45th Soviet Rifle Division. Under the command of Bessarabian Yona Yakir, the division fought in the Southern Campaign of the Russian Civil War; after the fall of Odessa, it took a 400 kilometre march across enemy lines, engaging along the way the forces of Yudenich, Denikin and Makhno. On February 13, 1920, Anatolie Popa was given the command of the 399th Regiment "Communist" of the 45th Division, which was sent to the Polish front, suffering heavy losses. Replenished to a full strength of 400, on March 23 the regiment was ordered to capture the settlement of Novo-Miropol'. The assault encountered strong resistance and Popa, heavily wounded, was captured by the Polish forces. He died under interrogation before the Soviets were able to take the town, three days later. Posthumously awarded the Order of the Red Banner, Popa was praised by Yakir in his 1929 memoirs as a "titan commander" who "possessed both great willpower and great endurance".

2019 AAF season

The 2019 AAF season was the only season in the history of the Alliance of American Football (AAF), which began on February 9, 2019. A ten-week regular season was scheduled for each of the league's eight teams.
On April 2, multiple sources indicated that Thomas Dundon, controlling owner of the AAF, had followed through on threats made in the previous week and suspended the AAF's operations, against the will of its founders. By the end of the week, the AAF front office had confirmed the suspension of operations and allowed players to opt-out of their contracts to sign with other leagues. The league filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 17, 2019.
At the time the season ended, eight out of ten scheduled weeks had been played, and the Orlando Apollos, with a league best 7–1 record two games ahead of its nearest competitors, had clinched no less than a share of the regular season's best record, regardless of how the rest of the schedule would have played out. A four-team playoff was scheduled to start on April 21, with a championship game on April 27. Initially scheduled for Sam Boyd Stadium on the outskirts of Las Vegas, Nevada, the title game was moved to the Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas, before the league ceased operations.
Teams.
The Alliance of American Football had eight teams competing during its inaugural season.
Final standings.
The Orlando Apollos clinched a playoff berth on March 24, and top seed in the Eastern Conference on March 30. The Birmingham Iron clinched a playoff berth on March 31.
Schedule.
Each team had a ten-game regular season schedule, consisting of six in-conference games (home-and-away against each of the other three teams) and four out-of-conference games (one game against each of four teams; two home and two away).

All of the preseason scrimmage games were held January 27–28 at the Alamodome, in conjunction with the league's training camp.
Playoffs.
Following the 10-week regular season, the top two teams in each conference were due to face each other in conference championship games, hosted by the higher seeded team. These semifinals were scheduled for April 21. The winners would then meet in the league championship game on April 27 at a neutral site. Originally, the title game had been set for Sam Boyd Stadium near Las Vegas, Nevada announced October 23, 2018 , but was changed to Ford Center at The Star in Frisco, Texas on March 20, 2019, before the season was ended.

Antikensammlung Kiel

The Antikensammlung Kiel is the collection of antiquities held by the Classical Archaeology Department of the University of Kiel, housed in nine basement rooms in the Kunsthalle Kiel. It is the only museum of its kind in the state of Schleswig-Holstein and includes internationally important collections of pottery from Magna Graecia as well as classical sculptures and casts of such sculptures.
History.
The university founded the collection in the first half of the 19th century, thanks to Peter Wilhelm Forchhammer, its first archaeology lecturer, supported by Otto Jahn. In 1840 he began raising funds for a museum of local and classical archaeology which he hoped would bring about an artistic revival in northern Germany and the following year he was given the first objects for the collection, even before the building was begun. These donations were casts of the sculptures from the Parthenon and arrived in Kiel in 1842. Kiel was then part of Denmark and Christian VIII of Denmark granted the university the main space in the chapel of Kiel Castle to turn into a cast gallery - that chapel had been destroyed by fire in 1838. It opened there on 18 January 1843. After that of the University of Bonn, it was the second archaeological collection set up in Germany or Austria and the first public art museum in northern Germany.
Directors.
The post of director is traditionally held by the head of the university's Classical Archaeology Department.

Governor Trumbull (1777 ship)

Governor Trumbull was launched at Norwich, Connecticut in 1777 as a purpose-built privateer. There is no record of her having captured any British vessels but she did raid Tobago in 1779. The Royal Navy captured her shortly thereafter and took her into service as HMS "Tobago". she served in the Leeward Islands until the Navy sold her in 1783, probably at Jamaica. She was apparently wrecked on 16 August 1787 at Tobago.
Privateer.
"Governor Trumbull" was commissioned on 18 November 1778 under Commander Henry Billings of Norwich, Connecticut, and fitted out at New London. She sailed from New London, Connecticut, at end-November. On 17 December the Connecticut privateer sloop "American Revenue", Captain William Leeds, arrived at New London with sails, rigging, and stores from the British transport "Marquis of Rockingham", which had wrecked on Gardiners Island on 13 December on a voyage from Newport, Rhode Island, to New York City. Of "Rockingham"s 22-man crew there were only five survivors. "Governor Trumbull" had assisted "American Revenue" in the salvage effort.
"Governor Trumbull" came into Stonington, Connecticut, at about the same time. She sailed from Stonington Point on 25 December, bound for the West Indies, and by mid-January 1779 was off Tobago. Billings decided to raid the lightly-defended island. 
On 16 January 50 men from "Governor Trumbull" landed at Man-o-War Bay. They established a small emplacement that they armed with two carriage and some swivel guns, and then the bulk of the force moved inland. An attack on a sugar mill cost the Americans three casualties. On the other hand, the men in the emplacement repelled an attack by Lieutenant Clark and 17 British planters and militia, killing one planter and wounding another. 
Clark regrouped and a second attack forced the Americans to quit their emplacement and return to "General Trumbull". The Americans had lost two men dead and some 26 prisoners. Billings then sailed north. 
On 5 March "Governor Trumbull" encountered two British warships, and towards the north end of St Bartholomew's. "Venus" set off in pursuit and after a chase of six hours, several shots from her chase guns and two broadsides, "Governor Trumbull" struck. The British took their prisoners of their prize and put a prize crew on board. Reportedly, "Governor Trumbull" had 103 men on board when the British captured her. 
Her captors took "Governor Trumbull" into St John's, Antigua. She arrived there on 7 March and was condemned.
A British listing of prizes taken in the West Indies described "Governor Trumbull" as being of 20 guns and 150 men. It also put the place of capture as off St Christopher's.
Royal Navy.
The Royal Navy took "Governor Trumbull" into service as HMS "Tobago", and commissioned her under Commander Butchart. Commander Charles Hotchkys replaced Butchart in June. Around November 1780 Lieutenant Benjamin Archer assumed command; he was promoted to commander in January 1781.
On 9 March 1782 Commander George Martin became captain of "Tobago".
"Tobago" was in company with and when they encountered the American frigate which was escorting south of Cape Canaveral on 10 March 1783. An inconclusive engagement developed between "Sibyl" and "Alliance" that proved to be the last battle of the American Revolutionary War. "Alarm" and "Tobago" neither participated in the engagement nor captured "Duc de Lauzun".
Commander Martin received a further promotion to post-captain soon after he left "Tobago" to take command of the 50-gun on 17 March 1783. Lieutenant Rowley Bulteel replaced Martin.
Fate.
The Royal Navy sold "Tobago" on 21 June 1783 for £2,050 in the West Indies, probably at Jamaica.
Post script.
"Lloyd's List" reported on 7 December 1787 that the "sloop Tobago" was totally lost on 16 August on the rocks on the windward side of Englishman's Bay, on the north side of Tobago.

List of Trump administration dismissals and resignations

Many political appointees of Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, resigned or were dismissed. The record-setting turnover rate in the first year of the Trump Administration has been noted in various publications. Several Trump appointees, including National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci, and Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price have had the shortest service tenures in the history of their respective offices.
Trump justified the instability, saying: "We have acting people. The reason they are acting is because I'm seeing how I like them, and I'm liking a lot of them very, very much. There are people who have done a bad job, and I let them go. If you call that turmoil, I don't call that turmoil. I say that is being smart. That's what we do."
For comprehensiveness, the list below includes, in addition to dismissals and resignations, routine job changes such as promotions (e.g. Gina Haspel from CIA Deputy Director to Director), officials moving to a comparable position (e.g. John F. Kelly from Secretary of Homeland Security to Chief of Staff), and acting or temporary officials being replaced by permanent ones. The list does not include many lower level positions, however, such as that of executive director of the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, Matthew Doherty, dismissed in November 2019, without a replacement to lead the council that was created in 1987. But some less prominent officials are listed because their departure was newsworthy.
Also listed are the officials who resigned in the aftermath of the 2021 United States Capitol attack, well into the presidential transition, when their term would have ended soon anyway.

Dozens of Trump administration officeholders resigned in reaction to the Capitol storming, even though their terms in office would expire fourteen days later with the inauguration of President Biden. Some senior officials, however, decided against resigning in order to ensure an "orderly transition of power" to the incoming Biden administration, out of concern that Trump would replace them with loyalist lower-level staffers who they feared could carry out illegal orders given by him.
Three members of the National Security Council resigned prematurely. 
Five senior officials at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) resigned in protest.

Books.
"The Last of the Tribe".
"The Last of the Tribe" (Scribner, 2010) focuses on the search and discovery of the last surviving member of an uncontacted indigenous tribe in the Brazilian Amazon. The "San Francisco Chronicle" called it "Avatar for grown-ups” and praised the book for being “expertly told: perfectly timed, thoroughly researched and descriptively written." The story was optioned for the screen by Chockstone Pictures and is currently in development.
"Between Man and Beast".
"Between Man and Beast" (Doubleday 2013) tells the story of Paul Du Chaillu, a young 19th century explorer who emerged from expeditions in Africa with the first specimens of the gorilla – an animal that previously was the subject of myth and legend. Du Chaillu’s adventures, both in the jungle and in the showrooms of Europe and the United States, coincided with the publication of Darwin’s "On the Origin of Species", and they helped ignite the evolution debate. The book was selected as one of the Best Books of 2013 by Amazon, and Barnes &amp; Noble chose it as a “Discover Great New Writers” selection. "Nature" called it “a supremely entertaining, enlightening and memorable read,” and the "San Antonio Express-News" remarked that “the mind staggers to recall that this story is a work of nonfiction.” 
"A Brotherhood of Spies".
"A Brotherhood of Spies" (Doubleday 2018) tells the story of the U-2 spy plane and explores how it forever changed the nature and scope of American espionage. The story focuses on four individuals involved in the plane’s development: Edwin Land, the founder of Polaroid; CIA officer Richard M. Bissell Jr.; Clarence “Kelly” Johnson, Lockheed’s chief engineer; and Francis Gary Powers, a pilot recruited by the CIA to fly the U-2. In a pre-publication review, "Publishers Weekly" wrote that “this exemplary work provides a wholly satisfying take on a central chapter of the Cold War – a dramatic story of zeal and adventure.”

Hereford County Hospital

Hereford County Hospital is an acute general hospital on Stonebow Road in Hereford. It is managed by Wye Valley NHS Trust.
History.
The foundation stone for Hereford County Hospital was laid in 1937 by Queen Mary. It was built adjacent to the site of the Public Assistance Institute. By 1946 the County Hospital provided 142 beds of which 25 were maternity beds.
A new hospital was procured in 1999 under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the old Hereford County Hospital, the Hereford General Hospital and the Victoria Eye Hospital. The new hospital, which was designed by WS Atkins and built by Alfred McAlpine at a cost of £62 million, opened in 2002. At the time concerns were expressed that the new hospital was too small to replace the facilities which were being lost. Consequently an additional ward, the Gilwern Assessment Unit, opened on the site in December 2015 providing an acute geriatric assessment unit. This was followed by a 24 bed medical assessment unit in November 2018.
In 2020 construction began on a new three storey block to replace the ageing Nightingale style Canadian Huts built in the aftermath of the Second World War. The new facility will provide 72 new inpatient beds and allow the hutted wards to be demolished. Concurrent works to expand the intensive care bed base from six to eight beds were also commenced. In all the new works will expand the bed base to approximately 272 by 2021.
Facilities.
The hospital has 236 beds. The site also houses the Stonebow Mental Health hospital which includes a psychiatric ward named after Jenny Lind, a Swedish opera singer. Facilities management services are provided by Sodexo.
Kier Group has a contract for a £40m programme of reconfiguration works at the hospital.

Indigenous metal music

Indigenous metal is heavy metal music played by indigenous peoples of various colonized regions. Bands may play music from across the metal spectrum, though most center indigenous themes, stories, or instruments. Groups with indigenous members are sometimes considered to play indigenous metal regardless of the thematic content of their music.
Indigenous metal entered American popular culture in the 1980s and early 1990s through the commercial success of songs like "Indians" by Anthrax. Several Native-fronted bands, such as thrash metal group Testament, also began releasing music dealing with indigenous themes during this period. Brazilian band Sepultura helped pioneer the style through the 1996 release of "Roots", which was created in collaboration with members of a Xavante community and is noted for its distinct Brazilian percussion, ambient field noise, and chanting. A Karajá man features on the cover of the album.
"True" native metal (heavy metal created by Native American artists who utilize traditional instruments and language) gained popularity throughout the 2000s, especially in parts of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas.
Characteristics.
Themes and lyrics.
The term "indigenous metal" is sometimes conflated with "tribal metal," which is more broadly influenced by pan-indigenous stories and follows Viking metal bands' approach to capturing their culture. Indigenous metal is often explicitly defined as exploring themes of "experienced dispossession, liberation, and death" in addition to preserving linguistic and cultural heritage. Native American metal bands in the Southwest United States sometimes refer to their musical style as "Rez metal," as it concerns political issues that make it popular amongst youth on reservations. 
Many bands focus on linguistic preservation by singing either partially or exclusively in their indigenous languages. Notably, New Zealand band Alien Weaponry have performed several songs in the Māori language on international stages. Bands Aborigene and Araña, who write about Maya civilization and Pipil stories, are among the most popular metal acts from El Salvador.
Musical style.
Artists may make use of cultural imagery, fashion, melodies, and instrumentation. In general, the use of percussion and traditional wind instruments are a core compositional element to indigenous metal music. Mexican band Cemican, for example, incorporate pre-colonial Aztec wind instruments such as stone flutes in their songs.
Language revitalization.
Metal that showcases indigenous languages plays an important role in revitalization efforts, especially when the languages used are endangered. In an interview, Alien Weaponry manager Niel de Jong voiced his belief that making the Māori language "...cool through music" may convince apprehensive Māori youth to learn the language. Brazilian folk metal band Arandu Arakuaa regularly perform in Tupi Guarani, Xerénte, and Xavante; they include a children's song on every album to promote the languages to young audiences. In 2013, Testament lead singer Chuck Billy, who is Pomo and spent much of his youth on the Hopland Band reservation, was recognized by both California State Assembly member Jim Frasier and the National Museum of the American Indian for his positive contributions to Native American image.
Some bands have faced backlash within their communities for unconventional language use. For example, Igloolik-based Inuit band Northern Haze were initially discouraged from writing lyrics in their native Inuktitut when they began releasing music in the 1980s.

Capri Everitt

Capri Aliyah Everitt (born August 30, 2004) is a Canadian singer and children's activist who is best known for receiving a Guinness World Record for "most national anthems sung in their host countries in one year." Everitt sang the national anthem in 80 countries between 2015 and 2016 (though only 76 counted for the record). She was eleven years old at the end of the tour. Everitt sang each country's national anthem in its own language, singing in a total of 41 different languages. The purpose of the tour was to raise money and awareness for orphaned and abandoned children, and all donations were given to SOS Children's Villages. A full-length documentary entitled "Around the World in 80 Anthems" has been made about the tour.
Biography.
Capri Aliyah Everitt was born on August 30, 2004 and raised in Canada and started singing and playing the piano when she was five. Everitt's family were fans of the Guinness Book of World Records and Everitt felt inspired by the book "The World Needs Your Kid." Everitt decided she wanted to sing as many anthems around the world as possible to raise money and awareness for orphaned and abandoned children. The plan was to raise money for SOS Children's Villages, which received all donations from the tour. Her parents sold their cars and rented out their home to finance the trip. They also received some funding for plane and train tickets from sponsors like Eurail and Flight Centre. The name of the tour was "Around the World in 80 Anthems" as a play on the name of the novel "Around the World in Eighty Days" by Jules Verne.
She began by singing in Ottawa, Ontario on November 19, 2015, then traveled to 80 countries within about nine months, singing each country's national anthem in its own language. She sang in a total of 41 different languages during the tour. The last stop was on August 12, 2016.
She received a Guinness World Record for "most national anthems sung in their host countries in one year." She then traveled around the world with her family and nine-year-old brother Bowen and sang the national anthem in about 80 countries. Everitt sang the national anthem in 41 languages, as she sang each country's anthem in its native language. Her final stop was in the United States where she performed at a Washington Nationals baseball game. At each stop, she sang the country's national anthem in full and in its native language. Although Everitt sang in 80 countries, only 76 counted for the Guinness record.
Everitt is a 3 time TEDx speaker/singer, having presented a TED Talk at the largest TEDx event in Asia, TEDx Chilliwack, British Columbia and TEDx Surrey, Canada.
Everitt started attending school in Vancouver and has been a speaker at WE Day events in both Vancouver and Winnipeg and she continues to raise money for children. Her family decided to create a book and documentary of the experience to raise more money for SOS Children's Villages. The short film, entitled "Anthems: A Journey Around the World", has won five awards and received 10 selections on the international film festival circuit. A feature-length documentary, "Around the World in 80 Anthems", was also shown at international festivals receiving four awards and nine selections.
Capri recently became the first singer in history to sing all 12 national anthems for an international girls soccer tournament in Dallas, Texas. The tournament, one of the largest girl's soccer gatherings in North America, featured over 135 teams from around the world and over 4000 girls. Capri raised over US$2000 during the tournament, declining to ask for a personal fee and allowing all of the proceeds to go to her charity of choice, SOS Children's Villages International. 
Everitt is also a songwriter and has released 4 singles: "New York in My Mind", "Girl Stand Up", "Push" and "Butterflies".

SS Themis (1911)

Themis was a steam cargo ship built in 1911 by the William Doxford &amp; Sons of Pallion for the Wabanas Dampskibskompani, a subsidiary of Nova Scotia Steel &amp; Coal Company and managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. She was named after Themis, Titaness of divine law and order.
Design and Construction.
On March 10, 1911 it was reported that a new company "The Wabana Steamship Company" (Wabanas Dampskibskompani) with a capital of NOK 1,500,000 was registered in Nøtterøy with the purpose of transporting ore between Newfoundland and Europe. The new company was a subsidiary of the Nova Scotia Steel Company and was managed by Wilhelm Wilhelmsen. Two ships were leased to conduct the operations ("SS Tellus" and "SS Themis") by the newly formed company for a period of 10 years.
The ship was laid down in 1910 at William Doxford &amp; Sons shipyard in Pallion. The vessel was launched on 30 March 1911 (yard number 419), the sea trials were held on 25 April 1911 (April 28 according to Norwegian source) with the ship being able to reach speed of . After completion of her sea trials, the ship was delivered to her owner on the same day.
As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, a mean draft of . "Themis" was assessed at 7,402 GRT, and 12,925 DWT which made her the largest ship in Scandinavia at the time, slightly larger than her sister ship "Tellus". The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 412 nhp triple-expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller, and moved the ship at up to .
Operational history.
On March 21, 1910 "Themis" was chartered to Nova Scotia Steel &amp; Coal Company for a period of 9 consecutive navigation seasons (April through December) for a fee of £2,031.5 per calendar month starting in 1911. On March 24, 1910 "Themis" was also chartered to Gans Steamship Company for nine consecutive winter seasons for a fee £1,562.10 per calendar month, starting in 1911 as well.
After completion "Themis" proceeded directly to North America and arrived at Wabana on May 11, 1911. During her maiden trip in May 1911 the ship brought 12,500 tons of ore from Wabana to Philadelphia. "Themis" continued operating on Wabana-Philadelphia route for the remainder of 1911. For example, in August 1911 she managed to make three trips from Wabana, bringing a total of 37,560 tons of iron ore to Port Richmond.
After the close of navigation "Themis" was chartered by The Spanish-American Iron Company, a subsidiary of Pennsylvania Steel Company, to transport iron ore from Felton in Cuba to Philadelphia and Baltimore throughout December 1911 and early spring of 1912. The ship departed for her first trip on November 26, 1911 and finished her charter on April 24, 1912. During this service the ship brought in over 100,000 tons of ore in 10 trips. For example, on December 19, 1911 the ship unloaded 11,000 tons of ore at Sparrow's Point in record time. In a similar fashion the ship brought and unloaded 10,900 tons of Cuban ore at Sparrow's Point on April 12, 1912. On April 25, 1912 the ship sailed for Wabana to resume her summertime ore carrying to Philadelphia which continued until the end of navigation season in early November.
On November 7, 1912 "Themis" departed Philadelphia for Tampa arriving there on November 13. There she loaded 3,073 tons of phosphates for transportation to Antwerp before continuing to New Orleans. After loading cargo, the vessel left New Orleans on November 26, but ran aground next day damaging her forpeak. Nevertheless, "Themis" pressed on with her journey and arrived in Antwerp on December 20 with a leaking forpeak and some damage about her deck caused by storms she encountered during her trip. The ship left Antwerp on January 5, 1913 to Savannah via Cardiff arriving there on February 7. 16,000 bales of cotton were loaded onto the ship in Savannah and she sailed out on February 14 for Bremen. After unloading, the ship then proceeded back to Wabana via Newcastle to resume ore transportation to Philadelphia until October 1913. On October 10, 1913 "Themis" left Wabana for Rotterdam and continued serving this route for the remainder of 1913.
On January 10, 1914 "Themis" departed New York City for Marseille, arriving there on January 30. After her return to the US, the ship loaded 1,652 tons of phosphate pebble at Tampa on March 10 and 5,500 tons more at Boca Grande on March 14, then proceeding to Galveston and Savannah, where 13,450 bales of cotton were loaded on March 24. "Themis" departed from Pensacola to Bremen on March 25, and arrived in Germany on April 16. After unloading at Bremen, the vessel sailed on to Wabana and resumed her ore shipments to Rotterdam through mid-August 1914. After arrival in Wabana on August 27, the vessel loaded ore and proceeded to Philadelphia arriving there on September 3, and from there continuing to Norfolk in ballast.
After the start of World War I "Themis" could no longer be involved in her transatlantic ore trade, as the main consumer of her cargo was Germany. She became a tramp ship and was chartered for any cargo that she could carry. She was chartered to carry coal and departed Norfolk on September 10 to Piraeus, arriving there on October 1. The ship then was chartered for one more trip, leaving New York on December 26, 1914 and arriving in Copenhagen on January 18, 1915. On March 31, 1915 "Themis" together with several other Wilhelm Wilhelmsen's ships was sub-chartered by Nova Scotia Steel &amp; Coal Company to Barber Line for a period of 8 months for a fee of £7,680 per calendar month. The vessel was handed over to Barber Line on April 28, 1915, and departed shortly thereafter for South America, visiting ports of Buenos Aires and Montevideo, returning to Boston on August 12, 1915.
On September 12, 1915 "Themis" departed New York for Wellington, Sydney, Melbourne and other Australian ports carrying 11,000 tons of cargo, the majority of which was case oil (including 24,000 cases for New Zealand) consigned for the Vacuum Oil Company. The ship reached the Panama Canal on September 21, by which time the slides occurred on the canal and delayed her until October 4, at which point the Canal was closed indefinitely. "Themis" was ordered to proceed to Australia via the Cape route, arriving at Durban on November 8. After re-coaling, the ship continued on to her destination reaching Wellington on December 13. "Themis" then proceeded to Australia and visited several ports until her departure on February 23, 1916 from Newcastle for South America. The vessel arrived at Montevideo on April 3, continued on to Buenos Aires two days later where she loaded among other things 8,341 bags of dried blood for New York. The ship arrived in New York on May 5, 1916 and after unloading was immediately chartered for cargo delivery to China. About 10,500 tons of cargo was loaded onto the vessel, including 200,000 cases of oil and 500 bales of cotton. The ship left New York on June 21, passed through the Panama Canal on July 2, arriving at Hankow on August 25, 1916. From there the ship continued on to Shanghai, and then to Philippines where she loaded 11,250 tons of sugar for delivery to New York.
On November 21, 1916 "Themis" on a passage from Iloilo for New York City grounded on the outer end of the West Breakwater in Limon Bay right after leaving the Panama Canal for sea. The ship laid with her bow aground until the afternoon of November 25 while the divers patched the holes in her hull and bulkheads. She was then pulled off and towed stern first into port of Cristóbal to discharge the remaining cargo, before being put into drydock at Balboa for repairs on December 10. About 2,000 tons of sugar were lost in the accident. The repair work was finalized on December 22 and the vessel proceeded through the Canal on December 24 to reload her cargo. "Themis" finally departed the Canal area on January 1, 1917 after reloading was completed.
On February 14, 1917 "Themis" left Baltimore with a load of acid phosphate bound for Rotterdam. From there the ship sailed to India where she loaded wheat cargo for transportation to Marseilles.
Sinking.
"Themis" sailed from Karachi early in the morning on September 7, 1917 carrying 11,000 tons of wheat, 260 tons of St John's bread and some other general cargo for Marseilles via the Suez Canal. The ship was under command of Captain Erling Jacobsen and had a crew of 36 men. Approximately at 01:00 of October 11, 1917, the vessel departed Malta escorted out of harbor by 4 British patrol boats. At around 07:30 on October 12, 1917 in an approximate position , about north off Cape Bon the ship was suddenly hit by a torpedo on her starboard side, around the No.3 hold. The ship started listing on her starboard side almost immediately and Captain Jacobsen ordered the crew to stop the engines and abandon ship. The lifeboats were lowered, and the crew left the ship in an orderly fashion. Shortly, two British escort vessels appeared, "HMT Portsmouth" among them, and started assisting the crew. All 37 men boarded "Portsmouth" who took them to Bizerta where they arrived around 22:30 on the same day. The crew later was transferred to French warship "Saint Louis" where they were provided with temporary accommodations. "Themis" sank stern first around 12:15 in an approximate position . It was later discovered that the torpedo was launched by German submarine .

Jorge Wagensberg Lubinski (2 December 1948 – 3 March 2018), was a Spanish professor, researcher and writer.
Graduate (1971) and PhD (1976) in Physics with extraordinary prize from the University of Barcelona, where he was Professor of Theory of Irreversible Processes and Statistical mechanics in the Faculty of Physics from 1981 to 2016. He was also a visiting professor at Danube University Krems (Austria).
Wagensberg was one of the most outstanding scientific disseminators in Spain as an editor, lecturer, writer and museologist.
He created and directed between 1991 and 2005 the Science Museum of the "la Caixa" Foundation in Barcelona, also leading the renewal of the same that culminated in 2004 in what is now called CosmoCaixa, with headquarters in Barcelona and Madrid. In 2005, the Generalitat de Catalunya awarded him the National Prize for Scientific Thought and Culture for his work imagining and creating the new Cosmocaixa. He remained the scientific director of the la Caixa Foundation until 2014.
As a scientist, Wagensberg made contributions to the production of scientific thought, in different fields, such as: thermodynamics of non-equilibrium, thermodynamics of microbiological crops, Monte Carlo method, theoretical biology, entomology, taphonomy, philosophy of science and scientific museology in specialized journals such as Journal of Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics, Physics A, American Journal of Physics, The Journal of Physics and Chemistry of Solids, Journal of Theoretical Biology, Bulletin of Mathematical Biology, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), Scandinavian Entomology, Beiträge zur Entomologie, Biology and Philosophy, Biological Theory, Computer Applications in Biosciences (CABIOS), Museum Practice or ECSITE News Letters.
He was president of the European Collaborative for Science &amp; Technology (ECSITE) between 1993 and 1995 and, in 2010, he was a founding member of the European Museum Academy (EMA). He collaborated regularly in the magazine Mètode and in the newspapers "El País" and "El Periódico".
He was the author of journalistic essays, a score of books and a hundred research papers on thermodynamics, mathematics, biophysics, microbiology, paleontology, entomology, scientific museology and philosophy of science. In April 2014 he published a work in the journal on cognition and evolution "Biological Theory", of the Konrad Lorenz Institute in Austria, on the essence of the scientific method: "On the Existence and Uniqueness of the Scientific Method" (2014), vol.9 ( 3), pp 331–346.
In 1983 he founded the book collection "Metatemas", of which he was editor since then. The collection, dedicated to scientific thought, has published more than a hundred titles by authors such as: Erwin Schrödinger, Albert Einstein, Konrad Lorenz, Richard Feynman, Stephen Jay Gould, Jacques Monod, François Jacob, Norbert Wiener, Murray Gell-Mann, Martin Gardner, Martin Rees, Richard Dawkins, Benoît Mandelbrot, Lynn Margulis, Douglas Hofstadter, Sheldon Glashow, René Thom and Wagensberg himself, among others. On its 30th anniversary the collection exceeds the 130 titles published.
He was the author of numerous aphorisms, published in newspapers (especially in " El País") and in compilation books, such as "Más árboles que ramas" (Tusquets, 2012).

Alexandre Isaac

Pierre Alexandre Ildefonse Isaac (9 January 1845 – 5 August 1899) was a French lawyer who was a left-leaning Senator of Guadeloupe from 1885 until his death in 1899.
He was of mixed African and European ancestry. He was particularly involved in colonial issues, always seeking administration based on justice and humanity.
He was one of founding members of the Human Rights League in France. 
Early years (1845–85).
Pierre Alexandre Ildefonse Isaac was born in Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe, on 9 January 1845.
He came from an influential "mulâtre" family of Pointe-à-Pitre.
The Isaacs were educated and wealthy, and were among a small number of people of mixed race who had managed to join the political and economic elite of the island.
Socially, Guadeloupe was still mostly segregated.
Alexandre Isaac studied law and became an advocate.
He was appointed a sub-inspector of registration, and was Director of the Interior of Guadeloupe from 1879 and 1884.
Members of the African community in Guadeloupe had mostly been transported to the island as indentured servants in the 1860s and 1870s.
In the 1880s they still lacked basic rights and civil liberties.
When they petitioned for citizenship in 1884 Isaac, as Director of the Interior, was strongly in favour of granting their request.
He said, "these foreigners ... have blended into the local population whose habits they have adopted, and today they continue with their hardworking tendencies, they are a population quite worthy of [our] concern."
The island's general council passed a motion in favour of their naturalization by a large majority.
Senator: first term (1885–94).
On 1 March 1885 Isaac was unanimously elected Senator of Guadeloupe.
His brother, Auguste Isaac(), became a deputy of Guadeloupe in 1893.
According to the black socialist politician Hégésippe Légitimus the Isaac brothers had betrayed the people of the island for the sake of their political ambitions.
They had sold out to the white elites and catered to every whim of the sugar producers.
From 1885 Isaac was an advocate at the Paris bar.
In the Senate he sat with the left, voted with the majority and participated in debates on topics such as primary education, sugar, the insane, the proposals by Anselme Batbie() concerning nationality, relationships between France and the Dominican Republic, organization of Indochina, colonial reform and the naval budget.
He voted for establishment of the district ballot, for the Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and for the Senate process against General Boulanger.
He was a member of the committees on war, the navy and customs, and was also a member of special committees to study legal and colonial texts.
He was elected Secretary of the Senate in 1892, 1893 and 1894.
Isaac called for the West Indian colonies to be assimilated legally and administratively as French departments.
In 1885 he presented to the senate the case for Guadloupe's African community to be given citizenship.
Isaac was a key speaker at the Congrès Colonial International de Paris of 1889.
The explorer Gustave Le Bon argued that attempts to educate the "inferior races" of the colonies would only cause them misery.
Isaac opposed this view, reminded the audience of the ideals of the French Revolution and said he could not understand how education could be held to be a bad thing.
In 1890 Isaac was deeply involved in the discussion of the bill to extend the 1888 bill concerning the Algerian indigenous people.
He was a member of a senate committee led by Jules Ferry to overhaul the Algerian organization in 1891, and was one of seven committee members who visited Algeria.
In 1893 he submitted a proposed law to change the system of representation of Algerian natives.
In this proposal Isaac downplayed the issue of polygamy, and stated, "it would not be impossible, after setting aside religious prescriptions, strictly maintained in the field of personal status, to release, as has been done in other respects, local legislation which would, in relation to the metropolitan legislation, only show differences of detail justified by the diversity of needs."
He noted that Algerian indigenous people were already subject to most aspects of French law, and the settlers also benefited from legal exemptions.
Senator: second term (1894–99).
Isaac was reelected on 4 February 1894 by 194 out of 286 votes.
In his election manifesto he clearly distanced himself from the revolutionary socialists.
He continued to sit with the radical left.
He was interested in all legal issues, but his main activity was in colonial issues, particularly those of Guadeloupe, the West Indies in general, and Algeria, and always in favour of humane and just administration.
He was involved in discussions on colonial administration in general, the boundaries between the French Congo and German Kamerun, formation of a colonial army, judicial organization of the colonies, creation of a Ministry of the Colonies, Annam and Tonkin, annexation of the islands to the leeward of Tahiti and a colonial health service.
Isaac visited Senegal in 1894 when François Devès was accused of libel, and Isaac and Hyacinthe Devès also visited French Sudan.
Isaac observed that local slavery was still in practice being condoned by the authorities.
He wrote to Senegal Governor Henri-Félix de Lamothe() about his concerns over arbitrariness, the protectorate system and the judicial system.
The governor was sure that Isaac was behind the attacks that two French newspapers made on his administration.
Isaac was involved in review of various reports on Algeria issued between 1892 and 1896, and submitted his own report on French and Muslim justice, police and security on 28 February 1895.
He issued a report on 15 March 1898 in which he asked the Algerian committee to end the system of attachment that Albert Grévy had started in 1881, and that had been expanded by Louis Tirman between then and 1891.
Isaac was one of the first members of the Central Committee of Ligue Des Droits De L'Homme, formed in 1898.
He was one of the moderate republicans in the early League, others being the first president, Senator Ludovic Trarieux, and Yves Guyot.
At an early meeting he pointed out that although the Dreyfus affair was absorbing, there were many other examples of injustice that demanded action, such as the plight of the Algerian Jews.
Alexandre Isaac died in office on 5 August 1899 in Vanves, Seine, at the age of 54.

La Messe de l'athée

La Messe de l'athée (English "The Atheist's Mass") is a short story by Honoré de Balzac, published in 1836. It is one of the "Scènes de la vie privée" in "La Comédie humaine".
Plot summary.
The main character, Desplein, is a successful surgeon. One day, Doctor Horace Bianchon, his former assistant and friend, sees Desplein, an atheist, going into the Saint-Sulpice church, and, knowing Desplein and his strong atheistic beliefs, decides to follow him. He sees Desplein alone attending a mass. After Desplein departs, Bianchon questions the priest from whom he learns that Desplein attends a mass at the church four times a year (at the beginning of each season) which he himself pays for.
A few years later, Bianchon sees Desplein going into Saint-Sulpice for the mass again; but this time, he questions Desplein about it. Desplein explains that when he was a poor medical student, already desperate, his landlord evicted him from the modest building he lived in, along with Bourgeat, his elder Christian neighbour originating from Auvergne. Bourgeat offered to look for a new place for both of them and eventually found two cheap rooms in the attic of another building. Thenceforth, Bourgeat became a father figure to Desplein. He helped to pay for Desplein's education, and did menial tasks like cutting the wood. After Desplein became successful, he bought Bourgeat a horse and cart for his water carrying work; Desplein would not have been capable of escaping his misery without the help of his Christian friend.
Bourgeat became ill some time later, but Desplein was able to cure him; howbeit, the following year, Bourgeat contracted the same illness, and this time succumbed to it. On his deathbed, Desplein by his side, he expressed religious hopes, including, of course, the humble wish of going to heaven. Desplein, having lost probably his closest friend, decided to dedicate his thesis to Bourgeat and to pay for the seasonal masses every year, reciting the wished-for prayers on behalf of Bourgeat; Desplein claimed that the prayers were "all that a man who has [Desplein's] opinions could allow himself." Howsoever many times Desplein repeated the prayers, he swore that "he would give his fortune in order that the beliefs of Bourgeat enter his head." 
The closing lines follow: "Bianchon, who treated Desplein whilst experiencing his last illness, today never dares confirm that the illustrious surgeon died an atheist. Believers would not like to think that the humble Auvergnat had come to open the doors of heaven for him, as he once opened the doors of the earthly temple whereabove one can read: to great men the homeland grateful."
Recurring characters.
Bianchon appears in several novels and stories of "La Comédie humaine", including "Le Père Goriot". He is the narrator of "Étude de femme" and "La Grande Bretèche".
Themes.
Sylvia Raphael wrote "..the unselfish devotion of the humble water-carrier is matched only by the profound gratitude and deep religious feeling (in the broadest sense of those words) of the irascible, often selfish, eminent atheistic surgeon. Balzac's awareness of the complexity of human beings, of the coexistence within them of conflicting traits, comes out clearly in the story of Desplein who, self-centered and ambitious, forms a bond with the water-carrier which survives even the latter's death."

Sergio Stuparich

Sergio Eduardo Stuparich Clementi (born December 14, 1943) was a Chilean author and philosopher descending from Italian immigrants from the Adriatic island of Lussin, Croatia.
Biography and career.
Stuparich was born and raised in the capital Santiago. An alumni at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and the University of Chile, he worked as a philosophy teacher at Santiago University of Technology (now Usach) before the 1973 military coup. At the same time, he was active in the Socialist Party and was therefore forced to put himself in safety at Italy's embassy when the military took over. In the meantime, he wrote the novel "Chile: Comprometerse con una clase", which was published later in exile.
After 1973, Stuparich was exiled in Italy, where he continued to teach and obtained a PhD qualification, Dottore in Filosofia from the University of Turin.In this period the writer had an extra marital relationship with an Italian, AMATO Romana, from whom he had a daughter later belatedly recognized in 2008, AMATO Stuparich Clementi Eleonora and with whom the author struggles to maintain relationships. He eventually came to live in Sweden.
During his time in Sweden, Sergio Stuparich undertook research at the Master level in Theoretical Philosophy at Lund University. He also produced the selection of the anthology "Uppbrott" (1982) and "Vote from Latin America" (1986), followed by books on Philosophy, "Del Homo al Hombre" (2011) and "El Pensamiento del Siglo XXI" (2012), and two memoirs, "La Guarida" (2008) and "Exilio Italiano" (2016). 
He died in Malmö, Sweden.

Penn State Forest

Penn State Forest is a state park in Burlington County, New Jersey, United States. The forest is protected as a section of the environmentally sensitive Pine Barrens. Various recreational resources are available to visitors including Oswego Lake and the Oswego River for swimming, boating, and fishing. The lake has a picnic area with a boat launch, swimming area, and primitive restrooms. Miles of unpaved roads composed of gravel, dirt, and sand traverse all areas of the forest. The roads are open for hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and cross-country skiing, as well as four-wheel driving. Hunting for deer, wild turkey, water fowl, and small game is permitted in season. A section of the Pine Barren Plains, a globally rare dwarf forest ecosystem that reaches a mature canopy height of about , is located in the northeastern portion of the park. Penn State Forest is operated and maintained by the New Jersey Division of Parks and Forestry.
The nearest settled areas include the unincorporated communities of Jenkins Neck in Washington Township to the southwest, Chatsworth in Woodland Township to the northwest, and Warren Grove, Manakawkin and Long Beach Island in Ocean County to the east-southeast. The northern section of Bass River State Forest is located to the north while the easternmost portions of Wharton State Forest and the main portion of Bass River State Forest are located to the south.
The first recorded inhabitants of the area were a branch of the Lenape tribe of Indians. Europeans built a small settlement called Penn Place on the Oswego River in the 19th century. The state purchased the land in 1910 and created what was initially called Penn Reserve. The Civilian Conservation Corps began building the park's gravel roads in 1933. A large-scale military exercise involving a division of army troops from Fort Dix participated in a mock invasion in 1941, prior to the US entry to World War II. Penn State Forest served as the temporary division headquarters during the exercise. In 1971, a supersonic jet on military bombing practice runs crashed through the park's fire lookout tower creating a long path of destruction.
From the 1950s to the 1970s, many proposals for a massive jetport spanning much of Burlington County failed to materialize due to increasing environmental concerns. In 1978, the federal government designated the New Jersey Pinelands National Reserve, further protecting Penn, Wharton, and Byrne state forests as well as all the surrounding Pine Barrens from future development efforts.
History.
The area was occupied by a branch of the Lenape tribe of Native Americans when the first European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. The Lenape left behind evidence of their passing in the form of shell middens from the shellfish they had consumed. A small village named Penn Place, consisting of just five buildings by the mid-1860s, was constructed by the settlers along the upper Oswego River. The village was named for a Penn family member who had, according to legend, previously resided in the area at some time in the 18th century; however, the first man named Penn to settle there was James Penn, who was the son of a sea captain named William Penn (a different man than the founder of Philadelphia and Pennsylvania). James Penn's descendants may have remained in the area until about 1890. Edwin Pue and his wife acquired the land and sold it to the state in 1910—the state's fifth acquisition for its park system.
In 1912, the state ran a telephone line across what was initially called Penn Reserve. A wooden fire lookout tower was constructed on Bear Swamp Hill (elevation ) in 1915. After the wooden tower burnt down, a modern fire lookout tower was built in 1960. That tower was destroyed when a plane crashed through it in 1971. An Air National Guard pilot named William F. Dimas, flying from McGuire Air Force Base, crashed during practice bombing runs in a supersonic F-105 Thunderchief over the Warren Grove Gunnery Range, which is adjacent to the state forest. The crash killed the pilot and destroyed about 1000 trees along a path about wide and long.
The first Civilian Conservation Corps enlistees arrived in 1933 and worked on road construction. The CCC workers at Penn State Forest consisted solely of African Americans since construction crews were segregated during that era. The CCC camp area is located to the northeast of Oswego Lake.
In the spring of 1941, prior to the US entry to World War II, a five-day military exercise involving 16,000 army troops from Fort Dix participated in a mock invasion that occurred near the coastal areas of the state. Penn State Forest served as the temporary division headquarters during the exercise.
In the late 1950s, a large airport was proposed by Burlington County officials to be constructed in the Pine Barrens, mainly to serve New York and Philadelphia. The airport would have spanned from Penn State Forest to Vincentown, a distance of about , including parts of the Wharton and Brendan T. Byrne (formerly, Lebanon) state forests. The plan included filling in Oswego Lake to make it a runway as just one small part of a supersonic jetport with four times the combined capacity of Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK airports. Eventually, environmental concerns about the project led to the federal protection of the Pine Barrens as a National Reserve in 1978, after airport proposals that had lasted for two decades.
The Pine Barren Plains.
The park preserves an area known as the Pine Barren Plains—also called the Pine Plains or the Pygmy Forest—a globally rare stunted forest ecosystem that reaches a mature canopy height of only about . New Jersey contains the world's largest acreage of this type of dwarf forest, including areas both within and outside the Penn State Forest. The trees are mainly pitch pine and blackjack oak in the northeastern portion of Penn State Forest. Researchers have speculated that the trees evolved to their short statures due to a combination of droughts, nutrient deficiencies, relatively higher-speed winds due to higher elevations than their surroundings, and more than twice as many wildfires as other areas within the Pine Barrens.
Oswego Lake.
Oswego Lake, a artificial lake created in 1942 by a dam on the Oswego River, provides opportunities for swimming, boating, and fishing. The lake functions as a reservoir for cranberry farms located downstream along the Oswego River. The upper stretches of the generally slow-flowing Oswego River, along the Papoose Branch at the east end of the lake, can be explored by canoe and kayak. Canoeists and kayakers can also head south out of the park along the Oswego River to Harrisville Lake by portaging around the dam.

Sebile

Sebile, alternatively written as Sedile, Sebille, Sibilla, Sibyl, Sybilla, and other similar names, is a mythical medieval queen or princess who is frequently portrayed as a fairy or an enchantress in the Arthurian legends and Italian folklore. She appears in a variety of roles, from the most faithful and noble lady to a wicked seductress, often in relation with or substituting for the character of Morgan le Fay. Some tales feature her as a wife of either King Charlemagne or Prince Lancelot, and even as an ancestor of King Arthur.
Origins.
The character of Sebile has her earliest roots in the Ancient Greek figure of the virgin priestess and prophetess known as the Cumaean Sibyl. This Classic motif was later transmuted into a Christianized character named Sibyl in the Christian mythology of the Early Middle Ages. The further transformation during the Late Middle Ages eventually turned her (as summed up by Alfred Foulet) from "the sibyl of antiquity, a god-possessed human prophetess, into the fay of mediaeval, particularly Arthurian romance, a queen and enchantress, only rarely virginal and prophetic, usually a lustful magician who entices heroes to her otherworld lair for prodigiously prolonged sessions of love-making. In the late mediaeval legend Sybil/Sybilla/Sebille comes to resemble Morgan le Fay so closely as to be conflated with her in those places in which she is not Morgan's rival or companion."
Matter of France.
Queen Sebile first appears in text in the Matter of France's "Chanson des Saisnes" ("Song of the Saxons", written c. 1200) as the young and beautiful second wife (a daughter in later versions) of the Saxon king named Guiteclin or Geteclin (representing the historical Widukind), who fights against the Franks. Queen Sebile falls in love with the Frankish king Charlemagne's nephew and Roland's brother, Baudoin, for whom she betrays her husband. After Guiteclin is killed, she marries Baudoin, who thus becomes the King of Saxony.
Later versions from various countries present her instead as a daughter of either King Desiderius of Lombardy in "Macaire ou la Reine Sebile", the Emperor of Constantinople in "La Chanson de la Reine Sibile" and Willem Vorsterman's "Historie vander coninghinnen Sibilla", or the pagan king Agolant in "La Reine Sebile". This Sebile marries not Baudoin, but Charlemagne himself.
In the early 13th-century French epic poem "Huon de Bordeaux", Sebile is a cousin of the story's eponymous hero, the Frankish knight Huon of Bordeaux. She uses her magical abilities to aid Huon in slaying her captor: a monstrous, 17-foot-tall giant named Pride ("l'Orgueilleux"), whom Huon defeats and beheads after a terrible duel. In "La Chanson d'Esclarmonde", one of the continuations of "Huon", Sebile is one of the three fay mentioned by name when summoned by the fairy queen Morgue (Morgan), Lady of the Hidden Isle (Avalon), to welcome Huon and Esclarmonde, his lover and daughter of the Emir of Babylon.
Matter of Britain.
Sebile makes her first known appearance in an Arthurian legend in Ulrich von Zatzikhoven's late 12th-century German poem "Lanzelet", in which the loving fairy mistress of Prince Lancelot is named Iblis (or Yblis), an anagram for Sibil/Sybil. There, she is the only daughter of Iweret of the Beautiful Forest (Beforet), an enemy of the family of Lancelot's foster mother, the sea fairy Queen of the Maidenland. Iblis is the most virtuous woman, as proven by a magic cloak test (an arguably central motif of the entire tale), who falls in love with Lancelot in a prophetic dream before even meeting him. After Lancelot slays her father in combat (she faints when he fights and instantly forgives him after his victory) and he learns his name and real identity, Princess Iblis marries him as the new king of this realm. Lancelot later leaves to defeat hundred knights and marry the Queen of Pluris (marrying for the fourth time), but eventually escapes from her and returns to the faithful Iblis and their kingdom. Ruling their combined lands together, they have four children, and later they both die on the same day.
In the early 13th-century French "Lancelot-Grail" prose cycle, Queen Sebile ("Sedile le roine") or Sebile the enchantress ("Sebile l'enchanteresse") becomes a villainous character. She takes part in the kidnapping of Lancelot by her, Morgan le Fay ("Morgue la fee"), and the Queen of Sorestan. This story was made well known through Thomas Malory's retelling in his popular "Le Morte d'Arthur", where the three queens became four: Queen Morgan of Gorre (Rheged), and the unnamed trio of the Queen of Norgales (North Galys, meaning North Wales), the Queen of Eastland, the Queen and of the Outer Isles (identified by Malory as the Hebrides). The queens of Eastland and Sorestan appear identical in both versions, so Sebile seems to be the Queen either of North Galys or the Outer Isles in Malory's tale. They all are described as the most powerful female mages in the world after the Lady of the Lake. Sebile, the youngest of them, is noted as so expert at sorcery that she had managed to render Cerberus harmless during her visit to Hell. In a well-known episode from "Lancelot-Grail", found largely unchanged in Malory's compilation, the queens are riding together when they find the young Lancelot asleep by an apple tree (apples being a symbol of enchantment in the legends). Amazed by how fairylike handsome Lancelot is, they argue over who among them would be the most deserving of his love for reasons other than their equal social rank and magical powers (at least in the French original version, as Malory turns Morgan into a clearly dominant leader of the group). Each of them states different reasons to be chosen, with Sebile emphasizing her merry character, youth and beauty. The Queens consider waking up Lancelot to ask him to choose among them, but Morgan advises that they take him still asleep to their castle, where they can hold him in their power. The next day, the Queens appear before the awoken Lancelot in their finest clothes and ask him to choose one of them as a lover; if he refuses, he will never leave his prison. Despite this threat, Lancelot, faithful to his secret beloved, Queen Guinevere, categorically and with contempt refuses all three. Humiliated by his response, the angry queens throw Lancelot into a dungeon, but he is soon freed by the daughter of the King of Norgales' enemy (either King Bagdemagus of Gorre or the Duke of Rochedon) who asks him to fight for her father in an upcoming tournament.
In the Venician "Les Prophéties de Merlin" (written c. 1276), Sebile is part of a quartet of enchantresses: besides Sebile and Morgan (Morgain), here being her only lover among all the women, they include also the Queen of Norgales and the Lady of Avalon (Dame d'Avalon). They all are former students of Merlin, who had received dark magic powers through his demonic origin, and are also in good relations with the extremely villainous knight Brehus without Mercy (Brehus sans Pitié). Sebile remains a powerful sorceress, whose special skills include invisibility, but is clearly inferior to the Lady; this is evidenced in the episode where Sebile and the Queen of the Norgales together attack the Lady's castle with their magic (in Sebile's case, trying to set it on fire) without any real effect, while the Lady retaliates by effortlessly taking their clothes off and making the naked Sebile visible for all. Morgan too is greater in her magic and seems to be in a master-to-disciple relationship with the younger Sebile, but they are equal in their lust. The two are usually inseparable companions, but this is tested when they become rivals to seduce the widowed knight known as Berengier of Gomeret or Bielengier the Handsome (Bielengiers li Biaus), who first spends a night with Sebile but then leaves to marry one of Morgan's ladies, the virgin Lily Flower (Flour de Lis), who had kidnapped his child for Morgan. This results in a quarrel that goes from an exchange of worst insults to a physical brawl that leaves Morgan battered half to death by the younger Sebile; the Queen of Norgales then saves the remorseful and terrified Sebile from Morgan's revenge by reminding Morgan how they both stole Lancelot's brother Ector de Maris from her but she had forgiven them, and Morgan and Sebile soon fully reconcile. There are also other knights that Sebile is known to desire, especially Lamorak.
In the French text known as the "Livre d'Artus" ("Book of Arthur", written c. 1280), Sebile (Sebille) is a beautiful pagan queen of the Fairy Realm ("la Terre Fae") Sarmenie, who has just lost her husband. Queen Sebile has an affair with Arthur's knight Sagramore (Sagremor), who is at first her prisoner until he seduces her. Sagramore converts Sebile to Christianity when she hastily baptizes herself after he refuses to sleep with a heathen. An evil knight known as the Faery Black Knight ("Le Noir Chevalier Faé", "Cheualiers Faez") or Baruc the Black ("Baruc li Noirs") is revealed as the one who had killed her previous husband in order to marry her himself. The villain is then defeated in great battle and captured after a personal duel against Sagramore with Sebile's help. After that, Sebile marries Sagramore, who stays with her for 15 days before leaving to resume his quest. 
In the anonymous French prose romance "Perceforest", a massive prequel to the Arthurian legend written c. 1330, the most beautiful, wise and honorable enchantress Sebile is known variably as Sebile of the Lake ("Sebile du Lac") or the Lady of the Lake, Sebile of the Red Castle ("Dame du Lac, Sebile du Chastel Vermei"). In this tale, King Arthur is the descendant from the union of Sebile and Alexander the Great. Alexander is at first a young knight before becoming King Alexander of England and then battling to conquer the world. Sebile falls in love with Alexander on sight; she incites him into her mist-concealed Castle of the Lake (later the Red Castle) by magic and keeps him there through seduction. Their mutual love then grows, especially after Sebile nurses him back to health from a grave wound and Alexander lifts a siege of her castle by defeating her enemies. In one episode, travelling Sebile is attacked by four evil knights who want to rape her, but the Scottish knight Tor of Pedrac arrives at the last moment and slays the villains (their severed heads are then preserved with a spell and given to him as a memorial of this deed). After Alexander dies, Sebile marries Vestige of Joy, also known as the Knight of the Black Eagle, and gives him a daughter named Alexandre, also known as the Maiden of the Two Dragons. Other characters include her cousin Gloriane, the lady of Castle Darnant.
Italian folklore and other classic literature.
Another Sebile later appears at the end of the 14th century in the French "Le Roman d'Eledus et Serene" as a maidservant of the heroine Serene, "versed in the science of love". Serene and Sebile are considered doublets.
In central Italy, Sebile features in a local version of the Venusberg motif from Germanic mythology. In "The Paradise of Queen Sebile" ("Le Paradis de la Reine Sebile", "Il paradise della regina Sibilla"), Antoine de la Sale records a folk legend that he heard from locals at the aptly-named mountain Monte Sibilla in 1420: Sebile/Sibilla is depicted as a demonic fay sorceress who lives with an entourage of amorous nymphs in magnificent palaces and lush gardens within a subterranean, paradise-like enchanted realm (inspired by Morgan's Avalon). She welcomes guests to her kingdom of carnal pleasure ("voluttà"), but, if, entangled in the delights, they spend more than a year there, the guests are trapped forever in sinful bliss, waiting for the Last Judgment with the fairies.
In de la Sale's "La Salade" (written c. 1440), a German knight and his squire enter Queen Sebile's kingdom out of curiosity and revel for a year in its forbidden pleasures. Before it is too late for him, the knight realizes the sinfulness of this by witnessing how the fair ladies transform each week into adders and scorpions for a night, so he escapes and hurries to Rome to confess to the Pope just in time. The squire, who regrets having left the pleasures of the fairy realm, flees him and returns to the Sebile's earthly paradise; the Pope sends out messengers with the news of his absolution, but they arrive too late. Sibilla is gifted with her famed prophetic powers, but tells only bad news, never good. In a similar story included within Andrea da Barberino's prose chivalric romance "Il Guerrin Meschino" (the part written c. 1391), a pious knight, advised to seek out the fay Sebile ("fée Sébile") in her abode in the mountain near Norcia, goes through a cave to her realm; he stays there for a year, but refuses all temptation and only attempts to learn about his parentage, without success. He boldly resists the flattering advances of the fay and her damsels, whose sinister nature he suspects, but later too receives an absolution after confessing to the Pope in any case.
Sebile is also a recurring character in Italian works of the 16th century, such as in Gian Giorgio Trissino's "L'Italia liberata dai Goti" (1547). The names and characters of Sebile ("Sibilla"), Morgan le Fay ("Fata Morgana") and the fairy queen Alcina are often interchangeable in Italian tales of fairies; for example, Morgan substitutes for Sebile in P.A. Caracciolo's 15th-century "Magico". Pietro Aretino's 16th-century "Ragionamenti" mentions a certain "sister of Sibilla of Norcia and aunt of Morgan the Fairy (Fata Morgana)".

Fenwick (fishing)

Fenwick is a brand name of Pure Fishing.
Fenwick is named after a lake in Kent, Washington where 5 Seattle businessmen founded the company in 1952. Fenwick was an early pioneer in the use of fiberglass blanks to create fishing rods that were corrosive resistant to salt water and that quickly replaced metal and traditional wood and bamboo fishing rods for their durability and ease of maintenance.
Fenwick was purchased by Phil Clock and moved to Westminster, California in 1968 and focused on the fishing rod needs of Bass fisherman.
Fenwick was the first to market with an all graphite fishing rod in 1973.
Both Fenwick's fiberglass and graphite fishing rods led fisherman to innovate new ways to fish using the unique material properties of Fenwick fishing rods.

Hardy Fishing Rods is a brand of Pure Fishing.
In 1874 brothers William Hardy and John James Hardy started "Hardy Brothers" with the purchase of "Superior River and Sea Fishing Tackle" in Alnwick, Northumberland, England. 
In 1891 they patented and launched "the Perfect" fishing reel to complement the fishing lures they sold. It was successful and they received a royal warrant from King George V of the United Kingdom. They went on to develop numerous fishing reels featuring innovations like a full bail arm and long distance casting reels that would win competitions.
In 1897 they opened a shop in London's Pall Mall that lead to international expansion of their fishing rods, lures and guides still made by hand in England.
In 1967 Hardy Brothers was bought out by the Harris and Sheldon group and in 1985 renamed the "House of Hardy Limited." It was later merged with a former Hardy employee's fishing company and renamed "Hardy and Greys Limited" in 2004.
In 2008 the history of the House of Hardy was made into a documentary, The Lost World of Mr. Hardy.
In 2013 the company Hardy &amp; Greys was sold to Pure Fishing, a division of conglomerate Jarden Corporation, that was later renamed Newell Brands. Newell sold Pure Fishing to Sycamore Partners in 2018.

2018 Leeds City Council election

The 2018 Leeds City Council election took place on Thursday 3 May 2018 to elect members of Leeds City Council in England. It was held on the same day as other local elections across England and the rest of the UK.
Following a full boundary review of Leeds' 33 electoral wards by the Local Government Boundary Commission, the all-out election saw all of the council's 99 available council seats contested based on the new ward boundaries. Three of the previous wards were abolished and replaced (City &amp; Hunslet, Headingley, and Hyde Park &amp; Woodhouse for Headingley &amp; Hyde Park, Hunslet &amp; Riverside and Little London &amp; Woodhouse). The last all-out election in Leeds was in 2004 after the previous full ward boundary review in 2003.
With three seats available for each ward, electors were able to cast up to three votes for three different candidates. The first three candidates past the post in each ward won a council seat.
The Labour Party won the election with 61 of the 99 council seats.
Election summary.
This result had the following consequences for the total number of seats on the council after the elections:
Councillors who did not stand for re-election.
Incumbent Morley Borough Independent councillor, Robert Finnigan, did not stand in the ward he represented, Morley North. Instead, he stood in the neighbouring ward of Morley South Ward. However, Finnigan was subsequently not elected at the election for the ward.
Ward results.
Three councillors were elected for each of the wards.
An asterisk (*) denotes an incumbent councillor who stood again at the election, having 21 sitting councillors not stood again for their seats.
The percentage vote share (%) is calculated by counting only the highest-scoring candidate for each party and individual independent candidates. For example, the total number of votes cast by electors in the Adel &amp; Wharfedale ward for Barry Anderson (the highest-scoring Conservative candidate), Nigel Gill (Labour), Peter Jackson (Liberal Democrat) and Liddy Swales (sole Green candidate) was 7,980. As Anderson gained 4,856 votes, he took 61.5% of the 7,980 total possible ballots cast, whilst Gill gained 1,556 votes and 19.7% of the total votes cast.
The percentage change (±) is the proportion by which the individual party and/or candidate's vote share increased or decreased from the previous council election in 2016.
The turnout is the amount of registered electors who voted in the ward at the time of the election. The turnout percentage (%) is the proportion of registered electors in the ward who voted on the day of the election.

Kathleen K. Gilmore

Kathleen K. Gilmore (November 12, 1914 – March 18, 2010) was an American archaeologist and specialist on Spanish colonial archaeology. She was the first archaeologist to prove the location of Fort St. Louis, established by the French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle. She received the J. C. Harrington Award of Society for Historical Archaeology in 1995, the first woman ever honored by the society.
Early life.
Kathleen Kirk was born on November 12, 1917, in Altus, Jackson County, Oklahoma to Jesse (née Horton) and Rufus Patrick Kirk. She was the middle child of three and had an older sister and younger brother. Raised in Altus until she was twelve, the family moved to Tulsa, where she completed her secondary education. Beginning her studies in geology at the University of Tulsa (TU), after three years, she transferred to the University of Oklahoma (OU), where she obtained a bachelor of science degree. Hoping to work in the growing petroleum industry, she was unable to find employment in the male-dominated field during the Great Depression and enrolled in business school to learn secretarial skills.
Career.
Kirk had worked throughout her schooling at the Bone and Joint Center in Tulsa and the TU Library, after graduation she looked for a position as a geologist and found few opportunities for women. Taking a job as an editorial assistant at the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in Tulsa, she worked for a year, before she found a steady job. In the late 1930s, Kirk moved to Houston and took a job working as a stenographer for Humble Oil. Her employers appreciated her knowledge of geological terms, but hired her as administrative staff. Disliking the stenography pool, Kirk left to work as a typist with Superior Oil Company in Corpus Christi and eventually returned to Houston to work with Standard Oil of Kansas, where she remained until 1940, when she married petroleum engineer, Robert Beattie Gilmore, on Christmas Day.
Soon after their marriage, the couple moved to Dallas, where Robert took a position with DeGolyer and MacNaughton, of which he would later become president. Gilmore remained at home and raised their four daughters, Betsy, Judy, Pat and Sally and then in the early 1960s, she became involved with the Dallas Archaeological Society, participating in field schools, hosted around Dallas. One of the first digs she participated in was at the Gilbert site in Rains County, Texas in 1962. The following year, Gilmore enrolled in a new graduate-level program for anthropology offered by Southern Methodist University (SMU), studying under the tutelage of Ed Jelks and Fred Wendorf. Her first published paper, issued in 1967, dealt with the excavations she had conducted at Presidio San Luis de las Amarillas and at Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá.
At the time of her studies, there was an ongoing academic debate in the archaeological field as to whether the discipline encompassed only pre-historic sites or whether both historic and ancient sites were within the field. She attended a conference in 1967, in St. Louis of the Central States Archaeological Society, where the issue was debated, noting the ongoing reconstructions of Colonial Williamsburg. The group decided to form the Society for Historical Archaeology later that same year. As Gilmore was interested in history, she developed a method in which she used historic archival materials to inform her planning for field work, but was careful to note that flaws in records, inherent systemic biases and human error could alter the reliability of material.
Gilmore began searching for the complex of the San Xavier Mission in Milam County, Texas in 1968, which included the missions of Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, San Ildefonso, and San Francisco Xavier de Horcasitas, as well as the presidio of San Francisco Xavier de Gigedo. Successfully locating all three mission communities, using a Spanish survey from the time of the construction of the missions, and identifying the presidio site, the field work she conducted there became the basis of her master's thesis, "The San Xavier Mission: A Study in Historical Site Identification". After completing her master's degree in 1968, Gilmore contracted to work at several sites, focusing on Caddoan excavations around Lake Palestine and Rosario Mission for the Parks Department.
Completing her PhD in 1973, with a thesis, "Caddoan Interaction in the Neches Valley, Texas" she was approached by Curtis Tunnell, state archaeologist of Texas to analyze materials collected from a ranch on the Garcitas Creek to determine whether it might be the location of Fort St. Louis, which had been established by the French explorer, René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle in 1685. Analyzing artifacts and pottery sherds, she published "The Keeran Site: The Probable Site of La Salle's Fort St. Louis in Texas" later that same year. In 1986, she sent the pottery samples to Canada because extensive work had been done there on French ceramics of the period. Gerard Gussat analyzed the fragment and confirmed that it had been made in Saintonge and was French. Combined with the other materials she had evaluated, including Spanish artifacts, Gilmore revised her initial paper and confirmed that the site was definitively the location of Fort St. Louis. Her groundbreaking work solved the question of where the fort had been located and was the first proof of the actual site of the structure.
In 1974, Gilmore began teaching at the University of North Texas (UNT), as an adjunct professor and her appointment included a research appointment to continue her investigations. Over the next several years, Gilmore worked on numerous cultural resources management (CRM) projects for the state, including digs at Granger Reservoir, Lake Ray Roberts, Lakeview Lake, North Fork Reservoir, and a survey of sites along the Oklahoma/Texas border, known as the Red River Archaeology Project, which she directed. She also led the excavations in 1978 to survey Old Salem, North Carolina's Single Brothers Industrial Complex Site for consideration for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places and a 1981 preliminary test at English Turn, Louisiana to identify the location of a French and later an American site of Fort St. Leon. She was elected as president of the Society for Historical Archaeology, the first woman to hold the post. She also served from 1982 to 1983 as the president of the Texas Archaeological Society.
In 1990, Gilmore left UNT and began doing consulting work. In 1993, she consulted on a project to locate the site of the Mission Santa Cruz de San Sabá, which she had reported on in 1967. The mission was located in Menard, Texas. In 1995, when La Salle's ship "La Belle" was located, close to the location Gilmore had predicted, she worked on the excavation, which also discovered eight Spanish cannon at the site. She was the recipient of the J. C. Harrington Award from Society for Historical Archaeology in 1995, becoming the first women honored with the award. Between 1999 and 2002, she worked in conjunction with the Texas Historical Commission on a re-examination of the Keeran site, which not only reaffirmed the accuracy of her location of Ft. Saint Louis and discovered the Spanish presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto en la Bahía, which had been constructed atop the French fort.
In the mid-2000s, Gilmore returned to a project researching Felipe de Rábago y Terán, which she had developed an interest in when she was working on her masters thesis. The conquistador, who was the commander of the San Xavier and San Sabá presidios in central Texas, was suspected of involvement in a murder. Gilmore was determined to uncover his history and name his victim, Juana Francesca de 
Rodriguez, whose identity had been obscured from published accounts. Traveling to Spain, Italy and Mexico with an interpreter, and working with a palaeographer Gilmore pieced together the archival records and began compiling them into a book. During this period, she established the Texas Presidios Project, in part to locate the various sites where Rábago had command. In 2003 Gilmore became the inaugural recipient of the Curtis D. Tunnell Lifetime Achievement Award, which recognizes excellence in Texas archeology and in 2008, was honored by Governor Rick Perry and the Texas History Commission with receipt of the Governor's Award for Historic Preservation. At the time of her death, she was working on the final edits for publishing her book on Rábago, even editing in the hospital emergency room.
Death and legacy.
Gilmore died on March 18, 2010 at Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas, in Dallas County, Texas, from a heart attack. She is remembered as one of the first architects to study Spanish missions in Texas, one of the pioneer women in the field, and an expert on colonial archaeology.

Reynolds International Pen Company

Reynolds Pens is an Indian brand and a former American manufacturing company of writing instruments, mainly pens. Products commercialized under the Reynolds name include ballpoint, gel, rollerball, and fountain pens, and mechanical pencils.
History.
In June 1945, Chicago businessman Milton Reynolds was in Buenos Aires, Argentina, when he came across the first commercialized ballpoint, the Biro pen.
In October 1945, Milton was able to reverse engineer the Biro pen and was the first to manufacture and sell ballpoint pens into the US market. "Reynolds Rocket" pen was introduced at Gimbel’s department store in New York City, selling $100,000 worth of pens on the first day. Demand in 1945 was running 30,000 pens per day, making it America's #1 ballpoint pen. However, within three years the price of the pen went from $12.50 to 50¢.
The Reynolds Rocket Pen had a tiny ball bearing that let ink out only when pressed against the item you were writing on. In advertisements Reynolds claimed it had enough ink to 15 years without refilling.
In 1947, in a publicity stunt to promote Reynolds' pens Milton Reynolds and William Odom announced they would beat Howard Hughes's around the world record. They set a new record time of under 79 hours by flying the "Reynolds Bombshell" around the world while managing to pass out thousands of pens.
In 1948, Reynolds expanded overseas and opened Reynolds European, and later in 1959 spun out Reynolds European SA as an independent company focused on non-ferrous metals.
The Chicago-based Reynolds Pen Company closed with Milton Reynolds moving to Mexico. The French subsidiary survived as did their Indian licensee. Later, the French subsidiary would be purchased.
In 2000, Newell Rubbermaid acquired Reynolds Pens France and in 2007, announced they would be closing the French manufacturing plants, causing huge labor union protests.
In May 2016, Reynold's license—GM Pens International—in India decided to end their exclusive contract and stopped making Reynold branded pens, instead choosing to make their own Rorito brand pen.
Now Reynolds' license is Flair Pens, they market and distribute Reynold's pens in India. Reynolds has an R&amp;D facility in Chennai. Reynold Pens, along with Paper Mate and Parker, are brands owned by US based Newell Brands and are sold in more than 70 countries.

Lake Ellyn Park

Lake Ellyn Park is a public park located at 645 Lenox Road in Glen Ellyn, Illinois. The park is centered around Lake Ellyn, an artificial lake created for the Hotel Glen Ellyn in 1889. The hotel burned down in 1906, and Glen Ellyn citizens proposed turning the land into a public park; however, as Glen Ellyn did not have a park district, it lacked the legal authority to buy the land. The city's residents voted to create a park district in 1919, and the new district bought the land and added park facilities in the early 1920s.
The park's main building is the Lake Ellyn Recreation House, which was built in 1937. Designed by Frederick G. Walker and built with the help of the Works Progress Administration, the building features a large recreation space with a fireplace and views of the lake. In 1968, the landscaped Ruth Candy Parkway and the Perry Nature Preserve were added to the park; both were preexisting Park District properties that bordered the park.
The park was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 7, 2017.

Tower of History

The Tower of History (originally the Tower of Missionaries) is a observation tower in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Located at 326 E. Portage Avenue, it was the tallest observation tower in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan when completed in 1968. The tower was built in a modernist style and consists of three vertical, trapezoid-shaped columns that support five cantilevered observation platforms. It provides a panoramic, 360-degree view of the Soo Locks, the St. Mary's River, Lake Superior, and cities on both the American and Canadian sides of the border. The view extends for roughly ; in total, approximately are visible from the tower.
History.
The Tower of History was built in 1968 by St. Mary's Catholic Church as part of a never-completed shrine to Catholic missionaries active in the Upper Peninsula that was to be named the Shrine of the Missionaries. It was designed by George Rafferty of Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Progressive Design Associates, while Frank Kacmarcik served as the project's art consultant. The tower was built on the site of Jacques Marquette's first log house and chapel. It was initially estimated to cost just $50,000 to build, although this figure soon ballooned to over $600,000 once recommendations from the project's architect and consultants were factored in; ultimately, the total cost rose to nearly $1 million.
The tower was planned to be complemented by a new church building and community center, although St. Mary's ultimately ended funding for the project. From the beginning, it was conceived as both a historical and a tourist attraction. The tower was originally intended to house a museum to 17th- and 18th-century missionaries as well as be connected to the planned new church building, effectively functioning as its steeple. Initially called the Tower of Missionaries, it was renamed the Tower of History to broaden its appeal to visitors. The tower was initially projected to cover its costs by visitors paying $1 or $2 to experience the view from the observation platforms, but according to parishioner and building committee member Paul Ripley, the unforeseen oil crisis precluded the tourism growth that they expected.
In 1971, due to the financial problems that St. Mary's was enduring, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Marquette assumed responsibility for the tower. In 1972, its operation was reorganized and it became directed by a state-wide board of directors. Also at that time, the tower employed 10 college students as workers. By 1975, it was attracting over 40,000 visitors a year. In 1979, an advisory board to the Diocese of Marquette's administrative board recommended either closing the tower or donating it to a civic organization. In 1980, the diocese donated it to Le Sault De Sainte Marie Historical Sites, Inc. (Sault Historic Sites).
The Tower of History includes museum exhibits about Catholic missionaries, local history, and Native American history. The museum exhibits and a video presentation are located on the tower's Lower Level, while three separate viewing platforms (both open-air and glassed-in) and additional exhibit space are located on the Upper Level. The tower features an express elevator that ascends to the viewing platforms in 45 seconds. The Tower of History is open to the public between mid-May and mid-October.

Hemp beer () is a form of beer infused with elements of the cannabis plant. Hemp beer is not brewed from hemp directly, but hemp products such as seeds are a later flavoring addition.
American breweries producing hemp beer include the Humboldt Brewing Company and Limestone Brewing Company.
Canadian microbrewery Cool Beer Brewing Company produces Millennium Buzz Hemp Beer.
Beermaking.
Hemp beer is unique in that its namesake derives from the addition of hemp to flavor beer. Breweries follow a basic guide of water, hops, barley or malt, and yeast in their own brews, which is based on then current German beer purity laws. Due to their close relationship as plants, the addition of hemp to hops based beers will maintain a complementing, but not identical flavor. Most, but not all hemp beers are hopped and then at some point in the process, hemped. Typically, a brew is hemped after the boiling process and then allowed to sit for several weeks to allow the yeast to ferment and the hemp to become infused. 
Hemp as an additive.
In the United States, hemp is defined under the 2018 United States farm bill as not having more than 0.3 percent THC. The low 0.3 percent dosage of THC is not enough to be psychoactive, whereas any cannabis plant with a greater dosage would be considered schedule 1 and potent. Breweries in the United States are currently experimenting with adding hemp to their own brews. Generally, the beer is brewed and then a body or piece of hemp is added in the final stages to give the brew an infused tastes and aroma. Due to the robustness and usability of the plant, several parts of hemp can be used as an additive during the brewing process in order to bring hemp flavor and aroma.
United States breweries.
Since marijuana is illegal federally, not every brewery is able to manufacture and distribute their own hemp beer. New Belgium brewery from Colorado was one of the first breweries to experiment with different forms of hemp, before producing a legal beverage. Larger beer producers such as Blue Moon, Constellation Brands, and Molson Coors, are preparing to release their own brews in response to New Belgium's positive reception. Lagunitas Brewing based in California have released a hemp and THC-infused beverage, that is only legal in its home state. As manufactures begin to experiment with the potential market, hemp will likely remain at the forefront followed by more CBD-infused beverages. Sweetwater Brewing Company in Atlanta, Georgia have already found success in a hemp infused and cannabis tasting beer without any psychedelic properties. More craft breweries and larger producers are more likely to develop their own products as the market becomes more demanding and legislation more relaxed.
Legal restrictions.
Federally, the United States still classifies cannabis as a controlled substance. Although some states have legalized the use of marijuana and hemp for business, personal, and recreational use, the federal restrictions creates a legal grey area. However, with the ratification of the 2018 Farm Bill, breweries and businesses are able to import, grown, and use hemp throughout their manufacturing process. The bill "puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law". Beers created using hemp or parts of it, have gone on to receive FDA approval. Brewers are unable to claim that their hemp infused products have any health effects without first being approved by the FDA. The administration is particular in what it approves, and beer that may have a pain relieving or psychedelic affect falls beyond the 0.3 percent limit of legal hemp. Beer producers may also choose to advertise their beer as being hemp infused, without any side effects in order to sidestep FDA approval. 
Flavors and aromas.
The flavor profile of hemp can vary, but the aroma is generally that of the cannabis variety. Depending on the brewer, what part of hemp used, preexisting or other added flavors, and how long the additives are allowed to infuse are variables that can impact the end result. Hemp beers have been described as having an "herbal flavor," "caramel" tastes, and a"stickily sweet and lightly bitter finish."

2018–19 Serie A

The 2018–19 Serie A (known as the Serie A TIM for sponsorship reasons) was the 117th season of top-tier Italian football, the 87th in a round-robin tournament, and the 9th since its organization under a league committee separate from Serie B. Juventus were the seven-time defending champions and defended their title following their victory against Fiorentina on 20 April 2019. The season was run from 18 August 2018 to 26 May 2019.
Events.
Hellas Verona and Benevento immediately returned to Serie B after finishing 19th and 20th while Crotone, finishing in 18th place, were relegated after two seasons in the top flight.
On 28 April, Empoli earned the right to come back to Serie A after one year of relegation. On 18 May 2018, Parma achieved promotion having finished second in the 2017–18 Serie B season, just three seasons after their bankruptcy relegation to Serie D. The last team promoted, after 2 years of absence, was Frosinone, who defeated Palermo in the Serie B play-off finals 3–2 on aggregate.
On 23 July, Parma were handed a 5-point deduction for the 2018–19 Serie A season, following text messages from Parma player Emanuele Calaiò "eliciting a reduced effort" from two players of Spezia during the 2017–18 season, a match Parma won 2–0 to secure promotion to this season. On 9 August, Parma had the 5-point deduction expunged.
On 14 August, the day of the Ponte Morandi bridge collapse in Genoa, the Italian Football Federation announced a minute's silence would be added for the victims of the collapse before all Serie A matches during the opening weekend that succeeded the incident. On 16 August, the Lega Serie A postponed the opening matches for both Genoese clubs Genoa and Sampdoria that were originally scheduled for 19 August.
On 13 September, Chievo was deducted 3 points after being found guilty of false accounting.
On 14 April 2019, Chievo was relegated from Serie A after a 3–1 defeat by Napoli, ending an eleven-year spell in the top flight.
On 20 April, Juventus won their 35th title and their eighth in a row with a win over Fiorentina.
On 5 May, Frosinone was relegated from Serie A after a 2–2 draw away at Sassuolo, going down after just one season.
On 26 May, Atalanta finished third and secured a place in the Champions League group stage, both for the first time in their history. Meanwhile, Empoli which were one point above the relegation zone ahead of Genoa, were eventually relegated to Serie B after they were defeated by Internazionale, while Genoa drew with Fiorentina.
This was also the last season of iconic Roma captain Daniele De Rossi that left the team after 18 seasons, while veterans Sergio Pellissier (from Chievo), Andrea Barzagli (from Juventus) and Emiliano Moretti (from Torino) retired from professional football at the end of the season.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the West Midlands (region)

The region of West Midlands is divided into 59 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 35 Borough Constituencies and 24 County Constituencies. Since the general election of December 2019, 44 are represented by Conservative MPs, 15 by Labour MPs, and 0 by Liberal Democrat MPs.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the West Midlands region will decrease by 2, from 59 to 57.

Zachary "Zak" Drake (born September 2, 1991) is a Canadian soccer player who plays for League1 Ontario club Oakville Blue Devils. He plays as a full-back or midfielder.
Playing career.
Early career.
Early in his career, Drake grew up playing in Ottawa, Canada. He won several youth tournaments, leagues, and individual awards. Most notably, in his U-17 season playing for Ottawa Fury in the USL Super-Y League, he was awarded Team MVP and received League recognition as the top 2% of players in the league. This led to an invitation to the US Olympic Development Program.
Drake accepted a Full Scholarship to NAIA school Holy Cross, and later transferred to Bethel University for his remaining three years of eligibility. Drake led Bethel's soccer program as captain in his senior year and they attended Nationals that year. He received awards such as All-American Awards and team leadership awards.
Drake also spent time playing in Brazil, Germany, Australia and Portugal.
Las Vegas Lights.
In January 2018, Drake signed with USL side Las Vegas Lights and lead the team in number of interceptions per minute and tackles per minute. His percentage of duels and tackles won were among the top in the team. He was the only player with a winning record within his games played at 3W 3T 1L (including Open Cup match vs. FC Tuscan). He appeared six times for the club in league play before returning to Canada at the end of June.
Vaughan Azzurri.
In September 2018, Drake signed with League1 Ontario side Vaughan Azzurri.

With the highest number of minutes for a field player, he led the backline to a nearly undefeated season, losing only once (to his old club, Vaughan Azzurri).

Critical response.
Reviewing the first two episodes of the anime, Steve Jones of Anime News Network gave the series a 3 out of 5 star rating, saying it "emerges as an odd beast to pin down", while also commenting that the show's comedy "[has] definitely been hitting more often than the average "isekai", with Jones admitting he had fun watching the episodes. In another review, Jones remarked how he enjoyed the show mostly because of its fan service. He also stated, "Do You Love Your Mom" continues to function as a reasonably amusing self-aware "isekai" romp with plenty of motherly cheesecake to titillate its audience, but in no way do I trust it to say anything meaningful about motherhood without tripping over itself." In a third review, Jones highlighted how the anime addresses real-life issues related to abusive parent-child relationships, as, according to him, "It's good to try and address abusive parenting."
Bipin Adhikari of Comic Book Resources expressed his opinion that the show is "as hysterical as the name suggests". The review anime website Beneath the Tangles wrote, ""Do You Love Your Mom and Her Two-Hit Multi-Target Attacks?" offers a fun play on the usual light novel shenanigans by saddling the hapless male protagonist with his doting mother. This does offer some amusing comedy. However, the [series] does also offer a nice glimpse at a deeper them of motherhood and managing the bond between a mother and a teenage child who's starting to want some independence." 
Allen Moody of THEM Anime Reviews gave the anime a 2 out of 5 star rating, criticizing the series for its absurdly long title and dynamics between the characters.

Are All Men Alike?

Are All Men Alike? is a lost 1920 American silent comedy-drama film directed by Phil Rosen. It stars May Allison, Wallace MacDonald, and John Elliott, and was released on November 8, 1920.
Plot.
Theodora Hayden, who gave herself the nickname of Teddy as an adolescent, is a wealthy socialite, with an appetite for airplanes and fast cars. She is engaged to her childhood sweetheart, attorney Gerry Rhinelander West. Spoiled, she is used to following her desires, without a thought to the consequences. When Gerry takes her to a café in Greenwich Village, she decides she loves the freedom of the Bohemian lifestyle the Village affords. Spurning West, she rents a place in the Village, and begins to paint incredibly horrendous pictures. She has her sports car parked in front of her building. In her encounters, she meets Ruby Joyce, another free spirit, and Ruby's boyfriend, Gunboat Dorgan, a boxer. In their interaction, Dorgan mistakes Teddy's flirting with true attraction. Teddy is then introduced to another artist, Raoul Uhlan, who tries to seduce her. When she rebuffs him, he turns aggressive. She is only saved by the entrance of Dorgan, who physically assaults the artist, throwing him out. Feeling that she now owes him something, Dorgan takes her in his arms and kisses her. She pushes him away, after which he storms out and takes her sports car for a joy ride. On his ride, Dorgan strikes another vehicle, causing extensive damage.
Teddy receives notice of three lawsuits against her. Ruby is suing her for alienation of affection, due to Dorgan feeling there is something between Teddy and him. The owner of the car which Dorgan plowed into is suing her for damages to the vehicle. Finally, Uhlan is suing her for the assault on him by Dorgan. Teddy confidently turns to her family, expecting their financial backing to get her out of her triple dilemma. However, her family spurns her. Distraught, she doesn't know what she will do, until Gerry re-enters her life. He promises to fix everything if she will simply agree to whatever he wants as his fee. She does, after which he makes everything right, as well as once again winning her affection.
Production.
In mid-June 1920 it was announced that Phil Rosen's contract was up with Universal, and that he had signed to direct a picture for Metro titled, "Are All Men Alike?", based on Arthur Stringer's short story "The Waffle Iron". On June 19 the following members of the cast were revealed: May Allison, Wallace MacDonald, Ruth Stonehouse, Winifred Greenwood, John Elliott, Emanuel Turner. The film had wrapped filming and was being edited by the end of August. On November 20, it was revealed that Lester Cuneo had joined the cast. The picture was released on November 8, 1920.
Reception.
"Exhibitors Herald" gave the film a generally positive review, enjoying Allison's performance, comparing her to Billie Burke, and also singling out the acting work of Ruth Stonehouse, William Green, and Lester Cuneo in supporting roles. They approved of the titles, lighting and cinematography. Overall they felt the film was pleasant, but slow-moving. "Wid's Daily" (one of the early titles to "The Film Daily") gave the film a lukewarm review. They felt the direction and cinematography were good, while the lighting was simply adequate, they highlighted the Greenwich Village feel of the interior shots, as well as some of the exterior locations. They felt that Allison's portrayal was satisfactory, while the supporting cast was adequate. The main detractions were the overall length of the film, based on the slimness of the story, and felt the titles contained extraneous conversation.

De Vivo's disk-winged bat

De Vivo's disk-winged bat ("Thyroptera devivoi") is a species of disc-winged bat found in South America. It was described as a new species in 2006.
Taxonomy and etymology.
It was described as a new species in 2006.
It was the fourth species described in the disc-winged bat genus and family.
The holotype used to describe this species was collected in 2000 near Serra Geral do Tocantins Ecological Station in Brazil.
It is possible that the currently-described species is a species complex that may face further taxonomic revision; it could undergo a taxonomic split with the description of a second species.
The eponym for the species name "devivoi" is Mario de Vivo; the authors of the 2006 paper chose to honor him with the species name because he "has been responsible for a considerable increase in the understanding of both mammal diversity and systematics in Brazil."
Description.
Its head and body length is .
Its forearm length is .
Its tail length is .
Its fur is cinnamon brown, with the ventral fur appearing frosted.
Range and habitat.
It is known from two countries in South America: Guyana and Brazil.

In 2015, the species was recorded in Colombia for the first time.
Conservation.
It is currently evaluated as data deficient by the IUCN.
It is a recently described species, and little is known about its range, population size and trend, ecology, and threats.
As of 2015, it was only known from four specimens.

Willets Point Farmhouse

The Willets Point Farmhouse is a double farmhouse at Fort Totten within Bay Terrace in Queens, New York City. It was built in 1829 in the Greek Revival style for Charles Willets, who had recently acquired the land surrounding the house. In 1867, the Farmhouse was expanded and renovated in Gothic Revival style. It was subdivided in the 20th century by the U.S. Army in order to provide officer housing for Fort Totten, and in the subdivision process, much of the original detailing was lost.
The building was abandoned by the Army in 1974 and the property was handed over to the City of New York. The farmhouse subsequently deteriorated and was vandalized despite the founding of the Fort Totten Historic District in 1999. In 2012, plans were made to renovate and stabilize the house, but as of 2018, it remains abandoned.

Eurilla Conservation Park is a protected area located in the Australian state of South Australia in the suburb of Crafers in the Adelaide Hills state government region about south-east of the state capital of Adelaide and about north of the town centre in Stirling.
The conservation park consists of land in section 535 in the cadastral unit of the Hundred of Onkaparinga. It is located to the east of the Mount Lofty Summit Road about south of the summit of Mount Lofty and is bounded on its northern boundary by the Cleland Conservation Park. It was proclaimed under the "National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972" on 22 September 1977. As of 2016, it covered an area of .
In 1980, it was described as follows:The main feature, and reason for dedication of the park, is an undisturbed bog consisting of a dense mat of the rare coral fern ("Gleichenia microphylla") and a sizeable colony of mature king fern ("Todea barbara"), an endangered species in South Australia. These specimens are amongst the finest in the state. An excellent bog habitat surrounded by "Eucalyptus obliqua" open forest over an open shrub stratum of "Exocarpos cupressiformis", "Banksia marginata" and "Pultenaea daphnoides". A dense ground stratum consists of a wide variety of herbs, grasses and forbs. There are many fallen logs in various stages of decay together with a substantial accumulation of forest litter. The park is substantially undisturbed and surrounded by native vegetation on three sides. This area has not been burnt since 1920, and suffers only minor influence from introduced species.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area. In 1980, it was listed on the now-defunct Register of the National Estate.

Lili Petschnikoff

Lili Petschnikoff (December 1, 1874 — September 23, 1957) was an American concert violinist.
Early life.
Lili Schober was born in Chicago, Illinois, but spent much of her youth abroad, studying violin under Joseph Joachim in Berlin and performing in Europe.
Career.
Lili Petschnikoff and her husband toured together as musicians in the United States in 1907. Petchnikoff gave a recital at the Aeolian Hall in 1916, with singer Clara Gabrilowitsch and pianist Rudolph Ganz. In 1919 Lili Petschnikoff gave a series of concerts at her home in Hollywood with pianist Cornelia Rider-Possart. She was officially retired by 1923, but played a radio concert with pianist Olga Steeb that year. She became a chamber music partner to Albert Einstein, who enjoyed playing violin with Petchnikoff in 1931, while he was working at the California Institute of Technology. She was also a friend to German singer Lotte Lehmann. 
She was said to own a Stradivarius violin, probably one of the two that her husband brought to the United States on his 1899 visit. Petschnikoff wrote an autobiography, "The World At Our Feet", published posthumously by her son in 1968.
Personal life.
Lili Schober married Russian violinist Alexander Petschnikoff. They had three children, Tatjana, Nadja, and Sergei, before they divorced. She reclaimed her American citizenship and eventually moved to Los Angeles during World War I, and her home opposite the entrance to the Hollywood Bowl was a gathering place of musicians and arts patrons. She died in 1957, in Los Angeles, aged 82 years.

Kia LaBeija

Kia LaBeija (born Kia Michelle Benow; March 18, 1990) is an American fine artist. Her most well known series, "24," is a sociopolitical commentary on the effects of growing up as a young woman of color with HIV. She is a former Mother of the Royal House of LaBeija.
Biography.
Kia LaBeija was born and raised in Hell's Kitchen, New York. Her mother, Kwan Bennet, was born in Subic Bay, Philippines and is Filipino American. Her father, drummer Warren Benbow, was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and is African American. She grew up in Manhattan Plaza and was in the dance program at Alvin Ailey. 
In 1993, LaBeija was diagnosed with HIV at the age of three, having contracted the virus through perinatal (mother-to-child) transmission. Her mother, Kwan, passed away of AIDS-related illness when LaBeija was 14.
LaBeija studied the arts at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts at The New School in Manhattan. At the age of 19, while at The New School, she became involved in the house and ballroom scene.
Fine art.
Kia LaBeija's work primarily is photography and dance. Her series "24" investigates her relationship to growing up with HIV as a woman of color in New York City. Her works have been included in group exhibitions, performances, and screenings at dozens of museums around the world.
LaBeija's work was featured as part of Art AIDS America, a touring group exhibition looking at 30 years of art making around HIV and AIDS. The show gained controversial press as there were only 5 black artists out of the 107 featured, with LaBeija being the only black woman. In January 2018, she was featured on the cover of "Artforum". She achieved this without gallery representation, major art collectors, or a solo show. She is a recipient of a 2019 Creative Capital Award with her partner Taina Larot, and was commissioned by Performa for its 2019 Performa Biennial.
Ballroom and voguing.
LaBeija came in the house and ballroom scene at the age of 19 in 2009 through a co-worker at Webster Hall. She began walking balls officially in 2012 and walked as a LaBeija for the first time at the last Latex Ball at Roseland Ballroom. She received the Hector Xtravaganza Xellence Award, named after her late gay father Hector Xtravaganza. In 2015, she was awarded the first Woman's Old Way Vogue of the Year. In 2016, she starred in band Pillar Point's music video "Dove". 
LaBeija appeared in the pilot episode of Ryan Murphy's Golden Globe and Emmy-nominated ballroom drama "Pose" as a principal dancer, and was featured in Wu Tsang's film "Into a Space for Love" for Gucci and "Frieze" magazine. Other credits include "A-Z of Aaliyah" for i-d Magazine and MAC and Calvin Harris and Sam Smith's lyric video for "Promises". In 2017, she was made Overall Mother of the Royal House of LaBeija, and stepped down officially in 2019.
Advocacy.
Kia LaBeija is an advocate for many underrepresented communities, especially people living with HIV/AIDS. She has been invited to speak at the CUNY Graduate Center, New York University, the New York Public Library, and Stanford University. "POZ magazine" placed her on the "POZ" 100 list of HIV/AIDS activists under 30. She has been featured on "HIV Plus Magazine"'s 20 Most Amazing HIV Positive Women list.
Accolades.
In 2019, LaBeija was honored by Performance Space New York. She was listed in "Dazed"s 20 best photos of 2018 and "PAPER" Predictions: 100 People Taking Over 2019. She has been featured in "W Magazine", "Vogue Spain", "Vanity Fair Italia", "The New York Times", "Numéro", "Ascent", "SLEEK", "Paper Magazine", and "Time Out New York".

Fears of a Clown

"Fears of a Clown" is the fourteenth episode of the twenty-ninth season of the American animated television series "The Simpsons", and the 632nd episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on April 1, 2018.
Plot.
Principal Skinner tells Groundskeeper Willie that he plans to retire, with Martin discovering the secret and blabbing it to the entire school. During the final sendoff, Skinner chooses Bart Simpson for his final farewell, who attempted to shoot him in the head with a rock. However, it was revealed that the retirement was just a ruse so Skinner would finally blow the whistle on Bart after years of being pranked by him.
Feeling embarrassed and angry, Bart chooses to pull off the ultimate prank to the entire staff by super-gluing the faces of Skinner and staff with plastic Krusty the Clown masks. Unfortunately, this causes people around Springfield to become terrified of clowns, and also causes Krusty to lose his comedic edge.
Because of this, Krusty is no longer a comedic character and even loses his clown appearance and make-up. Homer Simpson then says that Krusty looks just like him. Lisa then convinces Krusty to turn into a serious actor, and he takes part in a parody play version of "Death of a Salesman", called The Salesman's Bad Day, written by Llewellyn Sinclair (his second appearance from "A Streetcar Named Marge") who at first couldn't do, until Sinclair motivates him, causing Krusty to become a serious actor until his clown self appears in his mind, telling him that he is still a clown and nothing else.
Meanwhile, Bart is in court and was about to be free with the "boys will be boys" saying, until Marge Simpson objects and tells Judge Dowd that what Bart did was terrible and he has a real problem with pranking and suggests that Judge Dowd punishes Bart, resulting in him going to a rehab center for almost a month. Although Marge thinks she did a good thing, she doesn't know if it really was a good thing herself. During a session as Bart places tacks on the doctor's chair, the doctor convinces Marge to come in and sit on his chair, causing Bart to stop the prank and completing one step of his treatment.
After being released, Bart goes to apologize to the people whom he pranked. However, with the encouragement of Willie, Bart plans to pull the ultimate prank, staging a fake apology announcement at the gymnasium where above the crowd is a net full of water balloons. But when he sees Marge in the crowd, he tries to tell people to run away but the weight of the water balloons breaks the net, causing the crowd to get splashed with the water, with Marge finally realizing that "boys will be boys" saying is real and that motherhood "sucks", followed by Homer saying the same saying and Marge walking into the boys restroom to get even with him.
On the night of the play, Krusty is still being haunted by his former clown self. During the play, as Krusty tried to quiet the voice inside his mind, he causes the audience to laugh. He realizes that he is not a serious actor, but a clown, and starts to do comedic antics.
In the final scene, the play that Krusty was in is later seen being witnessed by the ghosts of Krusty, Arthur Miller, Rabbi Hyman Krustofsky, and William Shakespeare.
Reception.
Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave this episode a C-, stating, "Sometimes "The Simpsons" rolls out an episode that’s so pale an approximation of its best that sticking up for it becomes an exercise in hand-waving and deep, deep sighs. 'Fears Of A Clown' isn’t good. It’s also not bad. It is, instead, irrelevant in its hollow echoes of past, actually memorable, episodes. When the book on 'The Simpsons' is finally closed...and the inevitable all-time episode rankings are compiled, 'Fears Of A Clown' is one of those installments destined to elicit blank stares, even from die-hard fans. It barely exists."
"Fears of a Clown" scored a 0.9 rating with a 4 share and was watched by 2.06 million people, making it Fox's highest rated show of the night.

Secret Paths (video game)

Secret Paths in the Forest is a video game developed by Purple Moon. The game was designed to be episodic, and spawned sequels entitled ""Secret Paths to Your Dreams" and "Secret Paths to the Sea"”, which were released under Mattel after its 1999 acquisition of Purple Moon.
Plot and gameplay.
The game sees characters return from "Rockett's New School", where in a treehouse they reveal their deepest fears and thoughts. An example is Vietnamese-American child Minh, who is unhappy at the discordance in her parent's cultures. "Secret Paths to Your Dreams" acts as diary software akin to "Rockett's Adventure Maker".
Production.
The game was designed as a result of years of market testing the way boys and girls respond to games differently, something which was heavily discussed at the time in video gaming literature.
A 30-second TV spot for "Secret Paths in the Forest" played on network and cable stations in New York and Chicago in late 1997. In 1998, Purple Moon held a Sea World Treasure Trove promotion, part of which included the selling of this software at Sea World.
Critical reception.
In December 1997 alone, "Secret Paths" sold 23,539 units in the United States, according to PC Data. An article in "The New York Times" noted that young female playtesters enjoyed the title due to allowing them to see their own experiences played out through video game characters. In 2017, "Vice" retrospectively looked at the game as a "(now adorably primitive) digital tool for building visual narratives". "The Wow Climax: Tracing the Emotional Impact of Popular Culture" thought the game wholly embodied the juvenile goth tradition of revealing secrets to how the adult world works and giving the players tools to deal with it.
The title was one of the top fifty selling entertainment titles over the 1997 holiday season. It became one of Purple Moon's most popular games, and critically acclaimed. The game was nominated for a 1998 award by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences in the category of Computer Family/Kids Title of the Year.

Cannabis policy of the Jimmy Carter administration

During the administration of American President Jimmy Carter (1977–1981), the United States gave further consideration to the decriminalization of cannabis (marijuana), with the support of the president. However, law enforcement, conservative politicians, and grassroots parents' groups opposed this measure. The net result of the Carter administration was the continuation of the War on Drugs and restrictions on cannabis, while at the same time cannabis consumption in the United States reached historically high levels.
Campaign position.
During his presidential campaign, Carter responded to a candidate survey by NORML, and stated that he was in favor of decriminalization of cannabis, as had recently been passed in Oregon in 1973.
Presidency.
In a 1977 address to Congress, Carter submitted that penalties for cannabis use should not outweigh the actual harms of cannabis consumption. Carter retained Nixon-era (yet pro-decriminalization) advisor Robert Du Pont, and appointed pro-decriminalization British physician Peter Bourne as his drug advisor (or "drug czar") to head up his newly-formed Office of Drug Abuse Policy.
Decriminalization.
Six months into his administration, Carter was already speaking in support of decriminalization of cannabis, replacing imprisonment with civil fines, and removing federal penalties for possession of one ounce or less of cannabis. Carter supported softer enforcement regarding cannabis and cocaine, while maintaining a stricter stance against the perceived greater dangers of heroin.
Opposition.
Carter's momentum on decriminalization was impeded by the discrediting of Bourne, leading to Bourne's resignation on 20 July, 1978. Bourne came under controversy concerning his efforts to maintain the confidentiality of one of his staff for whom he had written a prescription for methaqualone. Shortly thereafter, National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws executive director Keith Stroup leaked Bourne's alleged use of cannabis and cocaine (which Bourne had previously characterized as being "acutely pleasurable" in "The Great Cocaine Myth," a 1974 article for the "Drugs and Drug Abuse Education Newsletter") at a party coinciding with the group's annual convention to journalists Gary Cohn and Jack Anderson in retaliation for the Carter administration's continued use of paraquat on Mexican cannabis fields.
Grassroots parents' organizations played a role in building popular opinion against cannabis decriminalization. The group Nosy Parents Association met with DuPont in 1977 and impressed upon him that youth cannabis usage was hurting students and families. Following this meeting, DuPont scaled back his support for decriminalization.
Carter was also opposed by conservative politicians. Ex-governor of California and future president Ronald Reagan used his syndicated weekly radio show to attack Carter for being soft on cannabis, and support stricter anti-cannabis policies.
Congress ultimately ignored Carter's support for decriminalization, alarmed by a sharp increase in the use of cocaine, and seeing cannabis as a gateway drug.
Compassionate Investigational New Drug program.
The Compassionate Investigational New Drug program (Compassionate IND) was founded in 1978 by the Carter administration, providing federally-produced cannabis products to a limited number of assigned patients. The program was closed to new applicants in 1992 under the George H. W. Bush administration.
Drug War in Mexico.
Carter spoke in favor of Mexico's program, funded by the United States, to eradicate cannabis in Mexico, stating: ""Marijuana happens to be an illicit drug that's included under the overall drug control program, and I favor this program very strongly."

Tiger (1813 ship)

Tiger was launched in America in 1813 and apparently captured on her maiden voyage. Captain Lewellyn purchased her in prize and initially she sailed between England and the Mediterranean. Under new ownership in the early-1820s, she started trading with New South Wales and India under a license from the British East India Company (EIC). She is last listed in 1833.
Origins.
"Tiger" apparently was launched in America in 1813. On 10 March 1813 "Medusa" captured the American vessel "Messenger", and on 22 March the American vessel "Tiger". It is highly likely that this "Tiger" was the "Tiger" condemned in the prize court on 4 May 1813 and sold to Llewellyn &amp; Co.
Career.
Initially "Tiger" traded between England and the Mediterranean.
In February 1817 "Lloyd's List" reported that "Tiger", Llewellyn, master, had had run onshore near Gravesend while on her way to Smyrna and Constantinople. It was expected that she would have to put back to repair. "Tiger", Powell, master, put into Northfleet Dock on 25 February to repair.
From around 1821 "Tiger" started trading with India and Australia. "Tiger", Brash, master, left England on October 1821 for Van Diemen's Land {VDL), and arrived at Hobart Town on 22 January 1822, having sailed via the Cape of Good Hope. She then sailed to Port Jackson, returning to Hobart Town on 20 April. She sailed for England on 26 May with colonial produce and 4000 bushels of wheat for Cape Town.
On 18 March 1825 Captain Kent sailed from England for Ceylon.
"Lloyd's Register" reported that on 9 August 1826 Captain R. Brash sailed from England for Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales. However, newspapers from Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, report that "Tiger", Captain Thomas Richards left England on 14 December and arrived 13 April 1827 at Hobart Town. "Tiger" carried a wide variety of goods consigned to merchants there. Captain Richards left Hobart-Town on 4 May for Port Jackson. After she arrived at Port Jackson, she was taken up for a voyage to Calcutta.
On 11 June 1828 "Tiger", Captain Richards, was at Concepción, Chile. Also in port was the brig "Indefatigable", ex–. On 18 August "Tiger" was at Tahiti where she was able to assist four men from "Indefatigable" who had arrived there by open boat, having been put in the boat after the Chilean crew members had mutinied on 21 July, killed Captain James Duncan, and taken her. The mutineers had retained the chief mate, Mr. Lossgreen, to navigate for them. "Tiger" brought the crew members she had rescued to Port Jackson around 24 September.
"Tiger" was carrying a cargo of wheat, tobacco, and horses. On her way to Sydney, as she neared the Australian coast, she had encountered a severe gale that damaged her spars and rigging. Two passengers on board, William Lowe and James Marshall, did such good work in assisting in the repairs to "Tiger" that Captain Richards refunded them their passage money. Lowe and Marshall later established a ship-building partnership.

Parish of Peka

Peka, New South Wales located at 29°53'04.0"S 143°58'36.0"E is an uninhabited cadastral parish of Ularara County in north western New South Wales.
Climate.
The climate is semi-arid, featuring low rainfall, very hot summer temperatures and cool nights in winter. 
The parish has a Köppen climate classification of BWh (Hot desert).
History.
The traditional owners of the Paroo River area are the Budjair, Kunja and Mardgany in the north and the Paruntiji, meaning people belonging to the Paroo, in the south. Aboriginal people are known to have lived along the Paroo for at least 14,000 years (Robins, 1999).
The Burke and Wills expedition were the first Europeans to the area, passing a few miles to the west.
Graziers came as squatters to the Paroo in the 1840s. They met resistance from the Aboriginal land owners, and tensions in the area continued well into the 1860s. From the 1850s however a shortage of white labour caused by the exodus to the gold fields saw many in the Aboriginal communities join the pastoral workforce. Aboriginal people continued to be a significant part of this work force for many decades whilst still maintaining their cultural traditions and attending local and regional ceremonies until the 1910s. From the 1920s however, Aboriginal people began to be forcibly removed from
their land by government policy.
From the 1880s to the 1910 drought, overstocking and rabbit infestation led to massive damage to land, soil and native plants and animals.
In 1978 the parish was incorporated into the Nocoleche Nature Reserve.

Armech Thermal Power Station

The Armech Thermal Power Station (ATPS), is a planned waste powered electricity power station in Ghana, with a proposed installed capacity of .
Location.
The facility would be located in the industrial area of the city of Tema, approximately , by road, east of Accra, the largest city and capital of Ghana.
Overview.
The Armech Thermal Power Station is a waste-to-energy (W2E) power plant located in Tema, Ghana's largest sea-port. The waste that will be burned to generate the electricity, will be sourced from several metropolitan and municipal assemblies in the Greater Accra Region. These include Accra, Tema, Ga South Municipal District, Ga East Municipal District, and La Dade Kotopon Municipal District. The Ghana Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development is a collaborator on this development.
The development of this power station is in response to the unsatisfactory waste-management environment in the Greater Accra area, particularly among the low-income communities. The dangers that these communities face include (a) bio-degraded waste that contains parasites and disease-causing microbes (b) toxic leachate which seeps from landfills into the water table and (c) the toxic emissions from landfill burning.
The poor environmental sanitation, leads to stagnation of drainage water and the breeding of disease-spreading mosquitoes. In the Greater Accra Area, 3.5 million malaria cases are recorded every year, with 900,000 of them occurring among children of less than five years of age, as of March 2018.
The power generated will be sold to the Electricity Company of Ghana, for integration into the national electricity grid.
Construction.
The power station is being built by "Armech Africa Limited". The main contractor is Energy China, with money borrowed from Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The construction cost is budgeted at US$300 million. This project represents the first grid-ready waste-to-energy project in the countries of the Economic Community of West African States. There are plans to develop a second waste-to-energy plant in Kumasi, in the Ashanti Region.

MAN TG-range

The MAN TG-range is a family of trucks produced since 2000 by the German vehicle manufacturer MAN Truck &amp; Bus. It is the successor to the F2000, L2000, and M2000 series. It consists of the TGA (now discontinued), TGL, TGM, TGS, and TGX.

Cannawigara, South Australia

Cannawigara is a locality in the Limestone Coast region of South Australia. It is crossed by the Dukes Highway and Adelaide-Melbourne railway line northwest of Bordertown. The southern end of the Ngarkat Highway is the Dukes Highway adjacent to the Cannawigara railway station. While the Dukes Highway runs northwest from Bordertown, Cannawigara Road runs due west.
The name of the locality is drawn from the railway station, which in turn was named for an 1851 pastoral lease. The word is an Aboriginal name for a long line of gum trees or a pathway of sticks over soft ground, and one of the six clans in the Tatiara region.
One of the major enterprises in the area is onion growing and there is a large packing shed near the former railway siding.

Jerusalem Center for Women

The Jerusalem Center for Women (JCW) is a feminist organization, established in 1994 as a part of a collaborative feminist effort with Bat Shalom known as the Jerusalem Link. The Jerusalem Center for Women aims to reduce hostilities between Palestine and Israel, as well as advocacy for women's rights in both areas. Most of the tactics utilized by this organization, include advocacy and workshops for community involvement, in addition to voice therapy sessions. The group receives support through international funding and attention.
History.
Founding.
The Jerusalem Center for Women was founded in 1994. At the time, the First Intifada had come to a close. The fallout that resulted from the conflict, gave rise to a renewed fervor of hostility from both sides, but also a renewed desire for peace advocacy. There was an idea for a collaborative initiative between an organization of Palestinian origin and an organization of Israeli origin, which was conceived during a 1989 summit on the activities of Palestinian and Israeli female activists. This idea would become the Jerusalem Link, a collaborative effort between one Palestinian and one Israeli group to work together on topics of feminism and peace between Israel and Palestine. Within the Jerusalem Link, the Jerusalem Center for Women represented the Palestinian side of the collaboration. Bat Shalom represented the Israeli side. This collaboration served as both a means to further advocacy goals, and a symbol of collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli people.
Aftermath of September 2001.
Though the Jerusalem Center for Women had received support at first, the election of President George W. Bush created obstacles that prevented the United States from delivering foreign support to the organization. The priorities of the United States government were altered, and the Israeli-Palestine conflict was not considered as high of a priority as it formerly was. The incident of September 11, 2001 had occurred at the time, and the United States had changed its focus from the Palestinian and Israeli conflict to the activities that occurred in Iraq. This gave rise to a concern among the members of the Jerusalem Link, that the Israeli government could take the opportunity to continue its expansion into Palestinian territories. The Jerusalem Center for Women in response, collaborated with Bat Shalom to ensure that equal rights were maintained while the attention of the United States was elsewhere.
Aftermath of Second Intifada.
While the First Intifada created some support for peace advocacy, the aftermath of the Second Intifada reduced the interest of peace in the conflict. This conflict caused some problems for the Jerusalem Center for Women. The governments in both Israel and Palestine were opposed to the idea of communication across the borders, something that went on to cause somewhat strained relationships between both the Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom.&lt;br&gt;
Despite this setback, the Jerusalem Center for Women continued their attempt to promote peace and equality. The organization's membership remained strong initially after the Second Intifada, due in large part to the emphasis on equality placed on its structure. During the year 2003, the Jerusalem Center for Women applied a variety of new programs to support and train women on how to advocate for their rights. These new programs were more hands-on approaches, which allowed the group’s members to play a more active role in state building. As the years went on however, tensions between the Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom increased with the hostilities of the Palestine-Israeli conflict.
Objectives and activities.
Goals and values.
The main goal of the Jerusalem Center for Women is to advocate for women's right in Israel and Palestine, and train them in ways with which they could influence the building and maintenance of the state through advocacy. The organization also advocates in favor of peace between the Israeli and Palestinian population. In its conduct towards the goal, the Jerusalem Center for Women tries to retain the value of equality through its structure and actions. The organization's location, membership, and leadership try to reflect this value of equality, and has helped it survive past the Second Intifada.
Activities.
In line with its goal of training women to play a more active role in communities, a common method used by the Jerusalem Center for Women is the creation of training camps for women in Palestinian and Israeli communities. These training camps educate women on topics such as politics, leadership, law, and culture. More forms of training would be provided over time. Conflict Resolution Techniques and From Grassroots to Decision-Making for instance, were two training camps led by the Jerusalem Center for Women that sought to convince women to actively advocate for the better of their community.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There were other programs outside of training camps established by the Jerusalem Center for Women within communities. During the earlier years of the organization's history, the Jerusalem Center for Women ran various forums for people to debate and discuss the matters of the Palestine and Israeli conflict. These forums were created as early as 1997, in which said forum consisted of a week of activities. Another method of advocacy that was used often by the Jerusalem Center for Women, came in the form of voice therapy projects. Similar to psychological counseling sessions, members of the Jerusalem Center for Women would hear the grievances of women who had fallen victim or knew of someone who had fallen victim to the Palestine-Israeli conflict.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Jerusalem Center for Women has also on occasion, attempted to appeal to individuals that held positions of power. The Jerusalem Center for Women was active during International Women’s Day for instance, to bring concerns of the organization and community to the Israeli government. The Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom also worked on an initiative in which they wrote letters advocating for peace, and sent them to be published on the news of both states. The Jerusalem Center for Women has also attempted to make appeals to foreign governments. These appeals would usually be expressed using active language, such as calling the Israeli occupation the catalyst for the violent response that occurred. An example of advocacy towards a foreign government, was a collaborative appeal to the United Nations, as a call to action.
Collaboration with Bat Shalom.
The Jerusalem Center for Women has collaborated with Bat Shalom on multiple occasions. The main goal of maintaining this relationship, was strengthening a sense of unity between Palestine and Israel. The group’s relationship was well at first, though there were some obstacles that sometimes impeded with collaboration. Near the beginning of their founding, the Jerusalem Center for Women encountered some disagreement with Bat Shalom regarding the definition of the Palestinian Right of Return. This was early in the formation of the Jerusalem Link, when both groups were constructing their joint guidelines of conduct, known as the Jerusalem Link Declaration of Principles. Though both groups agreed with the position of the Right of Return, they disagreed on a few details. Around 2001 to 2002, this disagreement caused the relationship between both groups to falter further. Both groups eventually agreed to implement their own definition of the Right of Return as equal dignity and rights for Palestinian and Israeli people.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Jerusalem Center for Women and Bat Shalom held their own symposium as early as 1997, known as "Sharing Jerusalem: Two Capitals for Two States." The Jerusalem Center for Women has also aided Bat Shalom in developing the Women’s Emergency Network. The network itself was meant to be a sort of reconnaissance measure, and was created after the United States turned its attention away from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The network was designed with the intention of monitoring the activity of Israeli detainment. In the event that there was action being taken against Palestinians, the women from either side would inform Bat Shalom. Both organizations would then work together on these issues.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
There was an attempt to maintain the value of balance in control between both groups, during their advocacy projects. When designing and executing these projects, both Palestinian and Israeli members were given platforms with which to speak and lead the organizational efforts. Furthermore, both groups tended to reflect upon the relationship they had with each other, in order to avoid having one group dominate over the other.
Structure and membership.
Members and location.
The Jerusalem Center for Women is situated between Palestine and Israel, on an area near the border called the West Bank. This location allows both Palestinian and Israeli people to access the organization. Activities are normally performed on the West Bank, as well as within Israel.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The Jerusalem Center for Women has multiple forms of leadership. The organization has a board of around 8 to 10 women to lead the group, and a group as large as 42 members that makes up an assembly to further discuss matters of leadership. Many of the members that have a position on the organization's board have also worked on the Jerusalem Link, or had joined the organization since its creation. Though there were no elections to determine new leaders for the organization, there would still be some changes in board members from time to time. If a decision was brought up within the organization, it would usually be passed solely by consensus.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The membership of the Jerusalem Center for Women is not entirely composed of these leading bodies however. Some members were hired to handle some of the more administrative roles of the organization. Joining the Jerusalem Center for Women is somewhat difficult, since the organization is more selective in its approach to accepting new members. Demographics are relatively balanced among those from Israel and those from Palestine, though there was a lack of representation from a subset of the Israeli people known as the Mizrahi. This lack of representation was not entirely uncommon, and could have been due to the emphasis on women's rights as a whole instead of having a specific focus on Mizrahi women's rights. Most of the organization's members have some form of education, such as a bachelor's degree or the necessary credentials to hold some government positions.
Funding and support.
The Jerusalem Center for Women has been receiving international aid for a long time. The organization has usually received funding from foreign countries. From the beginning, one of the more prominent supporters for the organization was the European Union, which also supported Bat Shalom.
The Jerusalem Center for Women’s international funding and support drew the ire from some of the other feminst groups in the area, with the worry that the organization might have been too institutionalized.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Though the Jerusalem Center for Women uses foreign support to help fund their activities, they also seek international support in order to attain a better platform to voice their concerns. To attain this support, the Jerusalem Center for Women usually tries to align its objectives with those of international governments. Sometimes, the activities of the group will have the additional goal of attracting the attention of diplomatic dignitaries to raise awareness internationally.

Philip Billingsley Walker

Philip Billingsley Walker (1841 – 5 August 1903) was a senior public servant with the New South Wales Post and Telegraph Department. He was heavily involved in the development of New South Wales' telegraphy and telephony networks. Notable for conducting one of the earliest wireless telegraphy experiments in Australia.
Early life and family.
Walker was born at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England, 28 February 1840.
His father, the Rev. James B. Walker (born 1794), became headmaster of King's School, Parramatta. His mother was Fanny Billingsley (born 1799). They married at Eynsham, Oxfordshire, England on 22 December 1824 and had a large family there, Philip Billingsley Walker being the sixth son. They emigrated to Australia in 1841, arriving at Launceston, Tasmania on 27 August 1841 on board the Arabian. They relocated to Sydney a few years later. The ten children of the marriage were as follows:
He married Louisa née Mitchell (born 1839) on 26 October 1861. They had six children:
Phillip Billingsley Walker received his education at the King's School, Parramatta where his father was the headmaster.
Professional career.
Shortly after leaving school he entered the public service as a clerk in the Works Department, but shortly afterwards transferred to the Telegraph Office, where he secured a position as operator. He rose rapidly in the service, by dint of sheer merit, and became secretary to the department during Colonel Cracknell's administration, when the telegraphs and post-offices were united under one permanent head. For many years he was assistant superintendent of telegraphs, and in the late 1890s was appointed by the Public Service Board to the position of Engineer-in-Chief to the department, an appointment he held until his death. He was a colonel on the staff, and director of telegraphs, and was in possession of the long-service medal. While con-nected with the Telegraph Department Colonel Walker introduced many needed reforms, and proved himself an efficient and painstaking ad-ministrator. When the Pacific cable agreement was being drawn up he was the officer to whom the Minister looked for advice. The late chief was held in the highest esteem, not only by the officers and employees of the department, but by all branches of the public service, and by a large circle of friends.
Wireless experiments.
On 10 August 1899, the Postmaster-General, one or two officers of the Department and representatives of the press, were invited to a demonstration of wireless under the supervision of P. B. Walker, Engineer-in-Chief of Telegraphs. The transmitting and receiving aerial wires were suspended on the corners of the roof of the Post Office building with the equipment itself in the laboratory below. The demonstration was entirely a success, though interference was present from adjacent tram lines. Walker stated that he felt there was presently limited commercial application, but nevertheless advised that further experiments would be conducted, with sea trials still to be decided upon. The transmitting was undertaken by Walker and the receiving by Watkin Wynne. All the equipment was manufactured by staff of the Government electrician, principally Mr. Nelson. A 12-inch induction coil was used for transmission and a two-inch coherer for reception. An amount of 150 pounds was stated to have been reserved for purchase of equipment from the Marconi Telegraph Company, with further experiments to proceed upon receipt. However Walker fell ill towards the end of 1899 and died in August 1900; with his death wireless telegraphy seems to have fallen dormant for many years.
Personal life.
Colonel Walker was a member of the Institute of Civil Engineers, a justice of the peace, an associate of several electrical societies. He was a noted chess player, and was vice-president or the Sydney Chess Club.
Late life and legacy.
Walker died of diabetes and pneumonia at Bligh Street, Sydney, on 13 June 1903 and was buried in the Waverley cemetery. His estate was sworn for probate at £4885.

Xiaomi Mi MIX 2S is an Android phablet manufactured by Xiaomi. Xiaomi unveiled a new version of the Mi MIX 2, the Mi MIX 2S, on 27 March 2018. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845, it features the same 1080p IPS LCD display found on the Mi MIX 2, a new dual 12 MP camera, Qi wireless charging, and is pre-loaded with Android 8.0 Oreo.
The Mi MIX 2S received a score of 97 on DxOMark.
Reception.
In August 2017, Mi MIX 2S was awarded the IDEA Gold Award for its design.
In reviews, the general feedback was favorable, with critics praising the more accessible elements of it over the original Mi MIX such as worldwide LTE bands, a lower price than the original Mi MIX, a smaller display and a traditional earpiece speaker to replace the piezoelectric speaker in the original Mi Mix. 
However, users (especially in France) report that the phone has issues managing 4G/4G+ connections. While connected to the 4G network, the phone has issues in handling the handover between cells, which disconnects the internet and it needs several seconds for the connection to be restored (even though the phone indicates strong signal and connection). Web pages do not load, VoIP calls (Whatsapp and Viber, etc.) get disconnected. Issue was fixed by software update
Android 9.0 "Pie" was released for the Mi MIX 2S on 30 October 2018.
Android 10.0 "Q" together with MIUI 11 was released for the Mi MIX 2S by end of 2019, and on 2020 was updated to MIUI 12. In Q3 2021 MI MIX was updated to MIUI 12.5

Lived experience

In qualitative phenomenological research, lived experience refers to a representation of the experiences and choices of a given person, and the knowledge that they gain from these experiences and choices. It is a category of qualitative research together with those that focus on society and culture and those that focus on language and communication.
In the philosophy of Wilhelm Dilthey, the human sciences are based on lived experience, which makes them fundamentally different from the natural sciences, which are considered to be based on scientific experiences. The concept can also be approached from the view that since every experience has both objective and subjective components, it is important for a researcher to understand all aspects of it.
In phenomenological research, lived experiences are the main object of study, but the goal of such research is not to understand individuals' lived experiences as facts, but to determine the understandable meaning of such experiences. In addition lived experience is not about reflecting on an experience while living through it but is recollective, where experience is reflected on after it has passed or lived through. The concept has been criticised as solipsistic and redundant.

Si Kak Phraya Si

Si Kak Phraya Si (, ) is an intersection in area of Wang Burapha Phirom sub-district, Phra Nakhon district, Bangkok. It is the intersection of Charoen Krung, Fueang Nakhon and Ban Mo roads. It is considered to be the second intersection of Charoen Krung, the first official street in Thailand, after nearby Saphan Mon (Mon bridge).
The term "Si Kak Phraya Si" can mean "Phraya Si's intersection" and comes from the Teochew word "角" ("Kak") meaning "angle" or "corner" and "四" ("Si") meaning "four", which refers the four-way intersection. Also, Phraya Si (พระยาศรี) is the name of Mon who has a house in this neighbourhood. He was an aristocrat during the reign of King Mongkut (Rama IV) and the leader in the construction of Charoen Krung including Saphan Mon. In addition, there is also Soi Phraya Si (Phraya Si alley), another way named in his honour. It is an alley that connects Fueang Nakhon and Atsadang roads to the Saphan Hok (Lifting bridge) over Khlong Lot (คลองหลอด; lit: "tube canal"). At this area, is the site of the first department store in Thailand – Harry A. Badman and Go., by Mr. Badman, British businessman in 1899 during the reign of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V).
So the name "Si Kak Phraya Si" is so named after the Chinese who were dragging the rickshaw through here during the reign of King Mongkut and still used as the official name until now. To this day, there're only two intersections with the prefixed "Si Kak" that are here and Si Kak Sao Chingcha (สี่กั๊กเสาชิงช้า) near Sam Phraeng area.
Besides, Si Kak Phraya Si was the site of the first café in Thailand named "Red Cross Tea Room" by Madam Cole (Edna S. Cole), an American woman who was founder of Kullasatri Wanglang School (Wattana Wittaya Academy). The café opened in 1917 during the First World War to raise money for the Red Cross to help the Allies. The location is also home to many luxury restaurants for foreigners and the elite of Thai society, in the period before the revolution in 1932, alike another areas in Bangkok, such as Ratchawong in Bangkok's Chinatown, Silom, Surawong or Si Phraya in Bangrak.

Chronicle of Rivius

The Chronicle of Rivius is a German-language manuscript often cited by Teodor Narbutt in his nine-volume work on the history of Lithuania and journal articles. Supposedly written between 1697 and 1730s by Jan Fryderyk Rivius, the chronicle remains unpublished. Lithuanian researcher Artūras Dubonis pointed out many inconsistencies in its authorship, unclear provenance, factual and chronological fallacies, and concluded that it is most likely a forgery, though more extensive study is required for a conclusive determination.
Provenance.
According to Narbutt, he accidentally purchased the manuscript in Reval in 1808. He first made references to the chronicle in articles published in 1817. Narbutt did not cite page numbers of the chronicle in his work, though the pages are numbered and he cited the page numbers of the Bychowiec Chronicle. Narbutt prepared a Polish translation of the most important parts of the chronicle and intended to publish it in a collection of primary sources on the history of Lithuania. However, the chronicle remains unpublished and is kept, along with the Narbutt's translation, at the Library of the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. 
Content.
The chronicle is written in German with some phrases in Latin and words in Latvian. Narbutt analyzed the chronicle and claimed that it used an earlier Russian chronicle, compiled by Mitrofan, a monk in Pinsk. This work by Mitrofan was used both by Rivius and by Augustinus Rotundus for his long-lost history. Thus, according to Narbutt, the Chronicle of Rivius preserved some unique fragments of Rotundus' work. Narbutt lamented that fragments of Rotundus work, including two genealogical tables, were lost when the last pages of the manuscript burned during a fire at his library in 1838. However, the surviving manuscript shows no fire damage.
The chronicle contains many obviously wrong and incorrect facts. For example, it claims that in 1276 a woman gave birth to 346 babies or that Turks made an assault on Belgrade in 1717. The chronicle also contains many unique, otherwise unknown, facts from the history of Lithuania. For example, Lithuanian and Samogitian golden coins from the 13th century, a Lithuanian pagan flag with a cock on the tip of the pole, an inscription on the tombstone of King Mindaugas, a description of the Perkūnas shrine in the Šventaragis' Valley in Vilnius. Some events are described differently in the chronicle than in Narbutt's works. For example, the chronicle records that Duke Mindaugas, his wife, and , Master of the Livonian Order, traveled to Rome in 1254 to discuss Mindaugas' coronation with the pope, while Narbutt described the trip in 1262 when Mindaugas traveled to clear his conscience of the apostasy and desire to serve pagan gods. In his comments to the translation, Narbutt even debated which version is more correct (though both are proved wrong by the 13th-century Livonian Rhymed Chronicle). 
Author.
Narbutt referred to the chronicle as "Kronika niemiecka J. F. R." (German Chronicle of J. F. R.) and revealed its author to be Jan Fryderyk Rivius (1673–1730/1735), grandson of Johann Rivius (1528–1596). However, in his chronicle Rivius provided his grandfather's biography that supplied no new information in addition to what was already known from the encyclopedias of Johann Friedrich von Recke and Karl Eduard von Napiersky, published in 1831, and of , published in 1777. The biography also repeated some mistakes found in these encyclopedias. Also, the 77-year gap between grandfather's death and grandson's birth is virtually impossible. The chronicle makes no mention of Rivius' father or his own life, other than he was born in Königsberg and in 1689 moved to Courland, where he worked as a pastor after pastor Grott moved to Libau. The exact same information about Grott was presented to Narbutt by Napiersky in a letter written in April 1833. Other researchers pointed out a Johannes Fridericus Ruvius from Wenden who became a student at the University of Dorpat in 1690, but Rivius was from Königsberg and it is unlikely that he "forgot" to mention his university education. Therefore, researcher Artūras Dubonis concluded that Rivius' biography was invented between 1833 and 1842.

Lordship of Cameros

The Lordship of Cameros (or Los Cameros) was a frontier lordship in the Sierra de Cameros in the province of La Rioja during the Middle Ages and the early modern period. It was originally part of the southern border of Navarre, comprising much of the territory that had been the Kingdom of Viguera in the first quarter of the eleventh century. It passed to Castile after 1076.
In the twelfth century, the lords of Cameros patronised the monastery of San Prudencio de Monte Laturce, where they were also buried. In 1162, Pedro and Diego Jiménez founded the Cistercian daughter house of Santa María de Rute. In 1181, they relocated it to Monte Laturce to "refound" the old monastery there on Cistercian lines.

L. Alex Wilson

L. Alex Wilson (1909-1960) was an American journalist who rose to prominence during the civil rights movement. He covered the Emmett Till murder for the African-American oriented, "Chicago Defender" chain, serving as the editor of the "Tri-State Defender". While later covering the Little Rock Nine school desegregation crises, Wilson was beaten and wounded by a white mob.
Biography.
Lucious Alexander Wilson was the editor and general manager of the "Tri-State Defender", an African-American newspaper published in Memphis, Tennessee. The "Tri-State" was then part of the influential "Chicago Defender" chain. In 1955, Wilson led the "Defender"s coverage of Emmett Till lynching, a catalyst for the civil rights movement. Wilson gained national attention when television images of him being beaten by a White mob were broadcast during his coverage of the Little Rock Nine finally entering Little Rock Central High School September 23, 1957. Wilson, a highly visible presence at 6'3", followed the black students to the school building until members of the racist mob started to attack him. He decided to walk, not run, away. After having been confronted by members of the KKK when he was younger and fleeing, he decided he would never run from racism ever again. A member of the mob hopped on his back and started choking him, and another one hit him in the head with a brick. One of the people he hired at the "Tri-State Defender" was Dorothy Butler Gilliam. After the events in Little Rock, Wilson became editor of "The Chicago Defender", but he died young, in 1960 (at the age of 51), possibly from the effects of the beatings he endured.

Information.
"Bumblebee" is the twenty-ninth domestic single released by Japanese hip-hop group Lead on April 25, 2018. It debuted at No. 5 on the Oricon Singles Charts and, by the second day, went up in ranking to No. 4. The single jumped again in rank to No. 2, where is stayed for the remainder of the week, giving the single the weekly ranking of No. 4 for its first week. The single was their first release in over six months, with their previous single being "Beautiful Day" released in August 2017. The single was officially announced via Pony Canyon's official YouTube for Lead on March 30, 2018, with the release of the music video.
The single was released in four editions: a standard CD, two CD+DVD editions with varying content and a version housing the CD and booklet. While the CD and CD+DVD editions house the b-side "Shizuku ~Sizk~" , the CD and CD+Booklet editions contain the song "Rosario ~ROZARIO~" .
The lyrics to the title track were written by Lead members Shinya Tanuichi and Akira Yamaoka, with Shinya writing the rap portions. The music was written and composed by Drew Ryan Scott, Darren "Baby Dee Beats" Smith and Sean Alexander. The b-sides "Shizuku ~Sizk~" and "Rosario ~Rosary~" had their lyrics written by Makihashi Shungo (best known by his stage name shungo.). While songwriter PHANTOM worked on both songs, "Shizuku ~Sizk~" was aided by PIUS and 345. "Rosario ~Rosary~" also had the help of Swedish songwriter Erik Lidbom and MUSOH.

Async – Remodels

Async – Remodels (stylized in all caps) is an album of "reconstructions" of tracks from Japanese producer Ryuichi Sakamoto's nineteenth solo studio album "async" (2017). The album includes eleven reworks (twelve on the Japanese release) by producers such as Jóhann Jóhannsson, Fennesz, Cornelius, Oneohtrix Point Never, Electric Youth, and Arca. Released in Japan in December 2017 by Commmons and in February 2018 in other countries by Milan Records, "Async – Remodels" garnered generally positive critical reviews and peaked at number 15 on the "Billboard" American Top Classical Albums chart.
Background.
In terms of the producers that contributed remixes to "Async – Remodels", Electric Youth, Motion Graphics, and S U R V I V E were suggested by the label Milan Records. Some of them were musicians Sakamoto was a fan of for a long time, including Oneohtrix Point Never, Arca, Yves Tumor, and Andy Stott. Other contributors included friends and previous collaborators with Sakamoto, including Alva Noto, Fennesz, Jóhann Jóhannsson, and Cornelius. Jóhannsson's reworking of "solari" was done as part of a "remix exchange" where Sakamoto also contributed a remix of one of Jóhannsson's songs for a remix album Jóhannsson was also working on. Arca and Yves Tumor also added their own vocals to their respective remixes.
Composition.
The tracks on "Async – Remodels" aren't remixes per se but rather "reconstructions" of music from "async" (2017) with only some parts sampled from the album. Some of the tracks, such as the remixes of "andata" by Electric Youth and Oneohtrix Point Never, make rhythmic versions out of the otherwise arrhythmic source material and also exaggerate certain melodies from it. Oneohtrix Point Never's remix is a calmer version of the original track, mainly driven by a piano performing the melody with synthesized plucks and, in the track's most intense moment, buzzing sounds surrounding it. 
Sakamoto described Electric Youth's Italo disco remix of "andata" as similar to his work with Yellow Magic Orchestra. Yves Tumor's remix of "ZURE" adds saxophone, a slow drum beat, a vocal line, and whisper sounds to the piece's instrumentation.
Other cuts, such as the Alva Noto remodel of "disintegration," Fennesz's "solari" rework, and Arca's reconstruction of the original album's title track, sound like completely new tracks from the musicians rather than remixes. In fact, when Sakamoto received Arca's remix, "at first I was wondering if I had been sent the wrong track." Fennesz's remix puts the melody of "solari" through a distorted atmosphere, and Alva Noto's reworking of "disintegration" "dilat[es]" the original track's piano plucks "to explore the chilly atmospheres between each note," wrote Andy Beta. More mellow than the original piece, Arca's rework depicts a loop of her singing the phrase "I peel my skin off for you" in Japanese. AllMusic journalist Paul Simpson described it as an "operatic epic filled with steely, trudging beats that sound like a knight in a broken suit of armor crawling across the ground, but never giving up the fight." Few tracks maintain most of the structure of the songs being remixed, including Motion Graphic's "fullmoon" remix.
Critical reception.
As AllMusic journalist Paul Simpson summarized "Async – Remodels", "the collection ultimately ends up feeling like a tribute as well as a remix album, serving to highlight Sakamoto's considerable influence on generations of forward-thinking electronic musicians." "PopMatters" found it to be "every bit as exploratory and delightfully weird as "async"," and "Exclaim!" stated that "Everything works here, in its own unique way." Eoin Hanlon of Australian magazine "Beat" called it "varied and ambitious," writing it has an "emotional progression that feels as celebratory as it does meditative." The diversity of styles was also praised in a review published in "All About Jazz", stating it "represents one of those rare occasions when two dissimilar ingredients give rise to something unforeseeably strange and new." Beta, also praising the album as ambitious and "tak[ing] the biggest risks," honored the remodels as "natural extensions" of "async", reasoning that they "all reveal the sizable debt and sonic paternity of Sakamoto on their own music." However, he also found the last three tracks to be the LP's weakest material, reasoning that S U R V I V E's recut "doesn't know what to do beyond adding dramatic synth washes to the original" and Stott's rework was "too light to be memorable." "Sputnikmusic" claimed, ""Remodels" at worst does indeed bastardize Sakamoto's intentions, [...] but the willingness to deviate from the original composition – and adding lush vocalizations and beats in their place – is a prime component of what makes [it] more than a simple throwaway remix album."
In a more mixed review, Daniel Martin-McCormick of "Pitchfork" wrote that "Async – Remodels" "glitters with aspiration and emotion, and yet rings slightly hollow." He reasoned that the remixes "simply struggle to cohere, or cohere a little too much. Across these mixes there's a surprising uniformity of tone and timbre, a kind of austere grandeur with lots of high end reverb trails, big percussion hits, and a sense of frozen futurism." He also panned the album's lack of female contributors given the number of women in 2018's experimental electronic scene such as Laurel Halo, Holly Herndon, Suzanne Ciani, Fatima Al Qadiri, Elysia Crampton, Nkisi, Pan Daijing, Pharmakon, Jlin, and Stellar OM Source. Daniel Bromfield wrote the album uses the "postmodern hellscape aesthetic" of avant-garde producers on its source material, which "sacrifices a lot of what makes "async" special, like its innocence and its bittersweet awareness of the transience of life." Alex Shutti of "Gigsoup" stated it would appeal to listeners of accessible music, but "any listener who has heard the original work can't help but want to return to the original project afterwards."

Chenxiang Highway station

Chenxiang Highway () is a station on Line 11 of the Shanghai Metro in Shanghai, located between and stations in the city's suburban Jiading District. It was conceived to be included with the first phase of Line 11 as "Universal Park Station", dependent on the expansion program of the adjacent Shanghai Universal theme park. However, with the uncertainly in the viability of the park expansion project, reservations were made in Line 11's alignment to allow for the station to be added at a later date as an infill station while the rest of the Phase 1 opened in 2009. Shanghai Universal closed in 2000 due to financial issues and low patronage, leaving the new infill station unnecessary. Planned redevelopment of the Shanghai Universal lands into dense residential and commercial properties reintroduced the need for a metro station to serve the area. The start of the infill station project was approved in 2014 now as Chenxiang Highway station. Construction of the station started in 2018 and it was opened on August 25, 2020.

Starfire Soccer Challenge

Starfire Soccer Challenge is a video game by Purple Moon, released in November 1998.
Plot and gameplay.
The game sees the player control an all-girls soccer team. The game sees a continuation of the characters from "Rockett's New School" and "Secret Paths".
Production.
The game's pioneering design was, like other Purple Moon titles, built off of years of research. At the time, American women were close to winning the World Cup, and women's soccer had become important to the target market. The research impacted both the plot and the user interface (UI) of the title. It became the first sports CD-ROM designed for girls. While boys' sports games have superstar athletes, this game was designed to have girl next door characters that the player could relate to. Sarah Stocker served as the game's producer.
Critical reception.
The game received a more positive reception from feminists than Purple Moon's other games. "Brenda Laurel: Pioneering Games for Girls" noted the game took a fresh take on the sports game. The journal article "Stuck on Screens: Patterns of Computer and Gaming Station Use in Youth Seen in a Psychiatric Clinic" described the game as an "outstanding example of digital technology supporting positive emotional development".
The game received a 1999 D.I.C.E award nomination for Computer Children's Entertainment Title of the Year.

Law of Bolivia

The law of Bolivia includes a constitution and a number of codes.
Constitution.
Bolivia has had seventeen constitutions.
Sources.
By 1840, sources of the law of Bolivia included: (1) Acts of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation, prior to the revolution of Bolivia. (2) Acts of the legislature of the Republic. Among these Acts there was a general code of laws, entitled Codigo Santa Cruz. This title is evidently in imitation of the title of Code Napoleon; for Santa Cruz is the name of the general who was elected president of the Republic in 1828; and under his presidency, the Codigo was published. (3) Decisions of the Bolivian courts. (4) Spanish law. (5) Roman civil law. (6) The ancient Peruvian law, or the customs and usages of the country.
Legislation.
The legislature has been called the Congreso Nacional. The gazette is called Gaceta Oficial de Bolivia.
Courts and judiciary.
Courts have included the Plurinational Constitutional Court, the Supreme Court of Justice and the Tribunal Supremo Electoral
Criminal law.
The Spanish Criminal Code of 1822 came into force in Bolivia on 2 April 1831. It was replaced by the Penal Code of 1834. A Law of 3 September 1883 made provision in relation to perjury. Bolivia now has a new Penal Code of 23 August 1972. 
There was a Code of Criminal Procedure of 6 August 1898.This was replaced by the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1972.
Copyright.
As to copyright, see the law of 13 April 1992.
Mining.
In 1892, the mining laws of Bolivia consisted of the Ley de mineria (Mining Law) promulgated on the 13 October 1880, and the Reglamento de la ley de mineria (Rules for the application of the Mining Law) made on the 28 October 1882. The International Bureau of the American Republics said that the "provisions of the Ley de mineria are simple and wise. They are contained in no more than twenty-seven articles and leave little room for casuistics or embarrassing technicalities."

Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform

Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform (VAMP) is a mission concept by the aerospace companies Northrop Grumman and LGarde for a powered, long endurance, semi-buoyant inflatable aircraft that would explore the upper atmosphere of planet Venus for biosignatures as well as perform atmospheric measurements. The inflatable aircraft has a trapezoidal shape that is sometimes called delta wing or flying wing, and would have dual electric-driven propellers that would be stowed during atmospheric entry.
The aircraft is proposed to be launched as a secondary payload on another spacecraft mission to Venus, probably on Russia's Venera-D in 2029. During daytime, VAMP would be able to make continuous science measurements, while at night the vehicle would descend to 50 km altitude where it would be fully buoyant, remain at a lower-power state, and still perform modest science measurements at the float altitude. The lower cloud layer of Venus, located between 47.5 and 50.5 km altitude, is acidic, but it is considered by some astrobiologists to be a target for exploration due to the favorable conditions for microbial life, including moderate temperatures and pressures (∼60 °C and 1 atm).
Overview.
Science driver.
The habitability of Venus' clouds has been a subject of discussion since scientists Harold Morowitz and Carl Sagan speculated it in 1967. Since then, subsequent studies have highlighted the potential for microbial habitability in Venus' cloud layers due to favorable chemical and physical conditions, including the presence of sulfur compounds, carbon dioxide (CO2), water, and moderate temperatures (0–60 °C) and pressures (∼0.4–2 atm). The surface conditions on the planet, however, are known to be inhospitable, with temperatures above 450 °C (860 °F).
Ultraviolet (UV) imaging of Venus reveals localised areas at cloud altitude that causes absorption between 330 and 500 nm. The Venus UV contrasts were first observed in Earth-based photographs in 1928 and subsequently measured by ground-based polarimetry in 1974, spectroscopy in 1978, and by spacecraft since 2008. Despite spacecraft investigations from orbit by "Venus Express", "Akatsuki" and "MESSENGER", and "Venera" entry probes (Venera program) spectroscopic observations show that the dark patches are composed of concentrated sulfuric acid and other unknown light-absorbing particles, but the chemical and physical properties of these contrasts are still unknown.
Since some models suggest Venus once had a habitable climate with liquid water on its surface for as long as 2 billion years, it is speculated by some scientists that these absorption features could be caused by large masses of microorganisms suspended in the lower cloud layer, and hypothetically thrive on iron- and sulfur-centered metabolism. On Earth, some extremophile bacteria can thrive in very acidic conditions, can feed on carbon dioxide, and excrete sulfuric acid.
Aircraft.
The Venus Atmospheric Maneuverable Platform (VAMP) concept started in 2012 through a collaboration between aerospace companies Northrop Grumman and LGarde, and it consists of an inflatable semi-buoyant aircraft with a science payload that can perform "in situ" measurements of Venus's atmosphere. The aircraft is scalable; the smaller version would have a wingspan of 6 m, and mass of 90 kg including instruments; a medium-sized would have 30 m wingspan and 450 kg mass, while the full-scale version has a wingspan of 55 m and a 900 kg mass.
VAMP would be deployed in space by the orbiting mothership, inflate, and fly into Venus's atmosphere without an aeroshell. The aircraft would be 10% buoyant, and would be able to cruise at 110 km/h when using propulsion and therefore, providing 90% of lift. The power source would be solar arrays and batteries.
When not propelled, the aircraft sinks to an altitude of ≈55 km above the ground, where it reaches 100% buoyancy. A passively floating vehicle also simplifies operations at night, as well as safe-mode procedures for recovery. The aircraft would be able to operate from several months to one year, and must be supported by an orbiting communications relay satellite for interactive -but not in real time- control. VAMP would fly at altitudes between 50 and 65 km and would cover a wide range of latitudes and all longitudes. There is ongoing research on the shape of the aircraft, its deployment, and resistance of different envelope membranes to the chemical (acid) and thermal environment of Venus. The team is also assessing the use of a lenticular shape which would significantly simplify packing, deployment sequence and structural mass, but it would not cruise so efficiently.
The vehicle concept was also presented in May 2017 as a proof-of-concept for exploration of other planets and moons of the Solar System with an atmosphere.
Science payload.
The 2013 preliminary concept envisions a suite of instruments NASA calls the 'Venus Flagship Design Reference Mission' for a balloon. Its mass is estimated at 20 kg and would require 50 W of electrical power to operate. The notional instruments consist of:
Potential missions.
There are ongoing discussions about possible NASA participation in Russia's Venera-D mission, scheduled for the late 2020s. In 2014, Russian scientists asked NASA if they would be interested in collaborating some instruments to the mission. Under this collaboration, Venera-D could incorporate some US components, including balloons, a subsatellite, a long-lived (24 hours) surface station, or a maneuverable aerial platform. Any potential collaboration is still under discussion.
The engineers working on the VAMP concept state that the aircraft is scalable, so a "medium size" version could potentially fly along on the Venera-D mission. This version would have a wingspan of 30 m and a mass of 450 kg, including instruments.
Northrop Grumman is also planning on entering NASA's New Frontiers program competition. If selected, it could be awarded up to $1 billion for design maturation, development, launch, and operations. However, it has been noted by experts that as proposed, VAMP cannot answer all key questions required by the NASA-chartered Venus Exploration Analysis Group's (VEXAG) 2014 science roadmap, and would be missing surface measurements and measurements of the surface's interaction with the atmosphere.

Civilian police oversight agency

A civilian police oversight agency, also known as citizen review board or civilian review board, is a body of civilians in an American city that is tasked with reviewing and improving police officer conduct. 
These agencies are an implementation of citizen oversight. This form of police accountability often gives the broader non-police community a medium to voice concerns and provide criticism of law enforcement operations, and improve officer conduct.
History.
The first recorded forms of civilian oversight took the form of police commissions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, by Progressive Era reformers. They were initially begun to decrease the influence of politicians on local police forces. This ultimately failed, as politicians infiltrated these commissions, though they had little expertise in the field of policing.
After the failed police commissions, civilian oversight was revolutionized, and had its beginnings in large cities such as Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and New York City. This started due to turmoil between African Americans and police in the early 1900s, and also failed, because these review boards were under-resourced, and performed not much beyond receiving and reviewing complaints about misconduct against police officers. Ultimately, the resistance faced by the police force, and the lack of resources caused these review boards to be disbanded and abolished.
In the 1960s, another wave of civilian oversight began. One of these agencies included the Public Review Commission, and the Office of Citizen Complaints. These boards were also created out of the turmoil between African Americans and the police, except this was during the Civil Rights Era, where these clashes arguably climaxed. What separated these civilian oversight boards from their ancestors was that this type of board utilized other agencies to investigate police misconduct. They also had more enhanced resources, more authority, and more durability.
Though the Civil Rights Era civilian oversight boards were not failures, there were advancements to these boards in the 1990s, up to the present day. The number of civilian oversight committees rapidly increased after the videotaped beating of Rodney King by the officers of the Los Angeles Police Department in 1991. Most of these agencies and committees were focused on reviewing reported police activities. However, this era created the first police auditors, such as the San Jose Police Auditor, and the Special Counsel for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, in 1993. Many of these auditors and review boards even combined into one stronger entity during this period. There were reportedly less than 40 civilian oversight agencies in 1990, over 100 by 2001, and 144 as of 2016, according to the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. To date, the Bad Apple Oversight Commission Database puts the total number of verified oversight commissions in the United States close to 200.
Forms.
Contemporary forms of Civilian Oversight Agencies are often varied due a large degree of variance between the backgrounds of such jurisdictions. Each Agency may vary due to specific social and cultural issues unique to that location. Despite this, there are typically three overarching forms of Civilian Oversight Agencies. They are: Investigation-Focused Models, Review-Focused Models, and Auditor/monitor-focused models.
Investigation-focused models.
Generally, this form of oversight agency is separate from the district's local police division. They operate by investigating reports of misconduct of police officers in their jurisdiction. The benefits of running an investigation-focused model agency is that they can complete thorough and impartial investigations into police conduct with a minimal degree of bias. It is common for those running these agencies to have a significant degree of training as to not improperly diagnose an investigation.
Further, these models heavily involve the citizens of the district they are representing. Thus, the operations of the investigation are transparent and this increases community trust in the operations of both the civilian oversight agency and the police department under which they reside. Another advantage to this model is the fact that it allows (more than others) for hiring of full-time staff to conduct the investigation - resulting in a more thorough analysis.
The negatives of this form are related to the significant costs of operation. This plays out largely in the costs of staffing full-time individuals to conduct investigations.
Review-focused models.
This category of oversight agencies are focused on reviewing the quality of internal investigations and especially those conducted by internal police-run oversight agencies. These are often entirely voluntary organization, unlike the Investigation-Focused models where there are often full-time investigators on the oversight agency. They are often focused on providing community input into the police investigation process to ensure that the community that the police have jurisdiction over has a voice.
The operations that a review-focused agency often implement are: to take in community complaints, review the police investigations of complaints from the community, make community recommendations to high level police directors, listen to community appeals, and to obtain and analyze community input.
The strengths of this model are that it may seem like these sorts of agencies are more transparent to the community that ones with full-time investigators. Further, it allows for community input into police-ran investigations, which can help in analyzing appropriate conduct for officers. Finally, they are also the least expensive option for oversight agencies since they are entirely volunteer run. Thus, they are more popular in areas with fewer funds to allocate.
The limitations of this sort of agency are that they tend to have a more limited authority over the conduct of police agencies. Further, they may be less independent from other oversight agencies since they rely heavily on the police department for information. Finally, due to a lack of funding, the members of these agencies are likely to have less training and ability to complete oversight into a police department effectively.
Auditor/monitor-focused models.
Finally, Auditor/Monitor-Focused models tend to be affecting systemic, large-scale reform to the police agencies within their jurisdiction. This is also one of the newest forms of citizen oversight and it tends to have a unique set of goals that distinguish it from other oversight agencies. These goals are: to monitor the internal complaint investigations process, to conduct evaluations of police training and codes of conduct, and to ensure effective public reporting.
One of the strengths of this sort of organization is that these agencies may have a broader access to critical information about police officer conduct and training. This allows for a deeper understanding of how to reform such an agency. Further, auditor and monitors of such agencies are likely to be experts in policing, allowing for a deeper fix than the other agencies. It is also likely that these agencies will conduct more change than superficial ones enacted by Investigation-Focused and Review-Focused Models. This would be because they are tackling the roots of what may cause poor police officer conduct and that it can also hold officers more accountable.
The limitations of such an agency would include a relative lack of community support for such an organization. This would stem from the fact that members of such a committee would be full-time, paid individuals and so may not "represent the community". Further, since a long-term systemic change is desired, compromises in individual cases may be made for the sake of systemic change. This may result in community backlash. Further, this form of citizen oversight can only make recommendations to law enforcement and cannot enforce changes onto them. Finally, the effectiveness of such an agency would depend heavily on the quality of individuals hired to do the task - more so than other oversight agencies. This is because ensuring a systemic change requires a high degree of technical sophistication and training to ensure effective outcomes.
Problems with oversight.
Issues civilian police review boards face.
45% of oversight agencies do not have enabling statues/ordinances that explicitly require that Law Enforcement Employees Cooperate with their agency. A further 69% do not have enabling statues/ordinances which require police officers/command staff cooperate as a condition of their employment. This allows lack of accountability on the hands of the police allows for obstruction of investigations and reviews by oversight agencies. 54% of oversight agencies reported that police officials did not implement their recommendations very frequently/frequently. 
Only 6% of oversight agencies are able to impose discipline on the police departments and officers they oversee. This lack of authority allows for police departments to ignore important recommendations made by oversight agencies. It can sometimes appear that explicit cooperation is provided to civilian oversight agencies by police departments along with respect for the legitimacy of the oversight agency, while at the same time a subtle and persistent push back exists to minimize the impact of oversight agencies. The intention of this push back is to cause the citizens to lose faith in the oversight agency's effectiveness or to have elected officials question the investment in the oversight agency and ultimately cause them to lose their funding.

Cannabis policy of the Ronald Reagan administration

The cannabis policy of the Reagan administration involved affirmation of the War on Drugs, government funded anti-cannabis media campaigns, expanded funding for law enforcement, involvement of the U.S. military in interdiction and eradication, reduction in emphasis in drug treatment, and creation of new Federal powers to test employees and seize cannabis-related assets.
Campaign.
During the 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan called marijuana "probably the most dangerous drug in the United States today".
Presidency.
Reagan's pick for drug czar, Carlton Turner emphasized during the selection process with Reagan's staff the necessity to perform interdiction, (cannabis) crop eradication and an "international program on something besides heroin". He told his staff "[addiction] treatment isn't what we do". Turner was a chemist who had been director of the Research Institute of Pharmaceutical Science, and run the University of Mississippi's Marijuana Research Project.
The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was created by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 as an executive function under Reagan. Under Reagan the office created the Just Say No ad campaign, for whom the First Lady, Nancy Reagan was also an outspoken proponent and even spokesperson. The campaign focused on "middle-class youth smoking marijuana".
In the first few years of the Reagan Administration, the Domestic Cannabis Eradication/Suppression Program (DCE/SP) run by the DEA expanded from seven states to forty. By 1985 it was active in all fifty states. The Campaign Against Marijuana Planting was initiated in 1983 in California, to become the country's largest eradication task force and including National Guard troops and federal resources including U-2 spy planes over Northern California.
The Reagan Administration saw a change in the Posse Comitatus Act to allow the U.S. Navy to join other Federal agencies engaging in "pot war" interdiction efforts. "For the first time in American history, U.S. naval vessels began directly to interdict drug-smuggling ships in international waters," and the interdiction budget expanded from less than $4 million in 1981 to over a billion by the end of Reagan's second term. In a 1984 radio address, Reagan said his administration had seen military operations like the South Florida Task Force (created in 1982) make "interdiction and seizure of major quantities of marijuana and cocaine" and had convinced Colombia to spray herbicide on its cannabis crops. The South Florida Task Force was "the most ambitious drug-interdiction program in the nation's history – all aimed at keeping marijuana out of the country".
Under Reagan, in 1985 the DEA began the nation's first non-military public employee mass drug testing program (including testing for THC metabolite).
In 1986, Reagan's Executive Order 12564 authorized drug testing for all Federal employees. The President's counsel acknowledged in 1987 that Federal courts had ruled mass testing programs unconstitutional, but the Executive Order "should survive a
well-reasoned analysis", "perhaps ultimately by the Supreme Court".
In 1986, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and "grouped cannabis with drugs like heroin". The bill was passed without committee hearings.
Civil asset forfeiture for cannabis-related activities was a major policy decision under Reagan, "not only sending pot users to jail but also 'forfeiting everything they own'" according to Ninth Circuit Court judge Stephen S. Trott (then a Reagan administration Associate Attorney General).
Legacy of the War on Drugs.
The War on Drugs was "most fiercely" waged by Presidents Reagan and his successor George H.W. Bush. A Government Accountability Office report found billion-dollar Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) media campaigns begun in the Reagan era "may have promoted perceptions among exposed youth that others' drug use was normal". The campaigns have been described as partly responsible for reframing the 21st-century debate on cannabis legalization "not by trying to shift attitudes about drugs, but by redefining marijuana as medicine and by focusing on the economic and social costs of the incarceration that has resulted from drug laws". Mandatory minimum drug sentences for cocaine and marijuana, established in the Reagan administration, have been "increasingly criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population".

Sand Lake, Iosco County, Michigan

Sand Lake is an unincorporated community in Iosco County in the U.S. state of Michigan. It is located near the center of Iosco County. Sand Lake is a census-designated place (CDP) for statistical purposes and has no legal status as an incorporated municipality. As of the 2010 census, the CDP population was 1,412.
Geography.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it is water. The CDP encompasses multiple lakes, including Bass Lake, Chappell Lake, Floyd Lake, Indian Lake, Island Lake, Little Island Lake, Round Lake, and Sand Lake.

List of census-designated places in Michigan

The following is a list of census-designated places in Michigan. According to the United States Census Bureau, the U.S. state of Michigan has 159 census-designated places (CDPs) used for statistical purposes at the 2010 census.
In the state of Michigan, CDPs are also categorized as unincorporated communities and do not hold any legal autonomy as an incorporated municipality. Their boundaries and population counts are for statistical purposes only, and CDPs fall under the jurisdiction of the township or townships in which they are located. CDPs can span multiple townships and counties and be part of a civil township or charter township but cannot contain boundaries within incorporated municipalities, such as villages or cities. Boundaries for a CDP may change between a census.
There are no minimum population requirements for an area to be designated as a CDP. The smallest CDP by population is Pilgrim with a population of 11. The smallest CDP by land area is Ponshewaing at . Forest Hills is the largest CDP in terms of both land and population with 25,867 residents and an area of .
Former census-designated places.
In some cases, a census-designated place may cease to exist and not be reported on an upcoming census. This may be a result of deletion, reclassification, or if the CDP becomes absorbed into an incorporated municipality. For the 2010 census, the United States Census Bureau removed 14 CDPs from Michigan. Of those, 11 were classified as minor civil divisions (MCD) that were already conterminous with an organized township and did not require dual designations. For the 2010 census, the U.S. Census Bureau removed the CDP designation for any MCD that was coextensive with a designated CDP. In Michigan, these remaining townships included Bloomfield, Canton, Carrollton, Clinton, Grosse Ile, Harrison, Plymouth, Redford, Shelby, Waterford, and West Bloomfield. These townships are no longer classified as CDPs, and there are no municipalities in the state that carry the CDP designation.
The K.I. Sawyer CDP, which was listed as the "military K. I. Sawyer AFB CDP" in 2000, was also deleted, but a small portion of the deleted CDP was reorganized and renamed as the "civilian K. I. Sawyer CDP" for the 2010 census. Greater Galesburg, Saginaw Township North, and Saginaw Township South are the only three to have been completely dissolved and not reported in any form from the 2000 census to the 2010 census.
Current list.
The following table lists all the census-designated places (CDPs) in Michigan according to data from the 2010 census. All information comes from 2010 census data, as well as listing population changes from the 2000 census. In the 2000 census, the state contained 95 CDPs. Of those listings, 14 were completely removed for the 2010 census, and 78 new census-designated places were created for a total of 159. Newly designated CDPs will be listed as having a population of zero at the 2000 census since they did not exist at the time. In the cases where a CDP spans multiple townships or counties, the township and county listed first contains the largest land area for the CDP.
Three CDPs also serve as a county seat: Atlanta (Montmorency County), Eagle River (Keweenaw County), and Mio (Oscoda County). Being designated as a county seat, however, does not give any legal authority or autonomy to the CDP and is merely the location of the county's seat of government.

Cannabis policy of the Gerald Ford administration

During the administration of American President Gerald Ford (1974–1977), the president moderated the strict anti-cannabis stance of his predecessor, resigned president Richard Nixon, though this did not result in any significant weakening of federal cannabis policy. In contrast with Nixon's harsh policies, Ford advocated instead reducing the harms associated with drug use. Ford struck a more conciliatory tone, identifying drug users as victims of traffickers, rather than criminals.
Presidency.
Ford retained White House "Drug Czar" Robert DuPont, originally appointed by Nixon. Unlike Nixon, Ford did not support the formation of an office of drug policy, however in 1976 he did not veto the amendment to create the Office of Drug Abuse Policy, though he failed to staff the office.
In 1975, Ford was questioned about his stance regarding decriminalization of cannabis, replying:
1976 campaign.
While running against Jimmy Carter in the 1975 presidential election, Ford took a harder line against cannabis use, rejecting the findings of the 1975 "The White Paper on Drug Abuse". Following his loss to Carter, in his remaining lame duck presidency, Ford again modified his position, and supported the "White Paper"'s position that more dangerous drugs should be combated while cannabis use should be a lower enforcement priority.
Personal life.
In his own family life, Ford confronted issues of drug use, particularly that of his wife Betty Ford who was later hospitalized for addiction to alcohol and opiates. In a 1975 interview, Betty Ford said of her children "I'm sure they've all tried marijuana," which was confirmed in October 1975 when Jack Ford publicly stated that he had tried marijuana, and downplayed any concerns regarding the drug. In response, Gerald Ford stated that while he did not approve of cannabis use, it was a "very honorable thing" for Jack to admit to its use, despite it being "not a healthy thing to have."

SS Michigan

The SS "Michigan" was a passenger steamship which transported passengers across the Great Lakes. At the time of her construction, she was one of the most advanced steamships on the Great Lakes. She offered luxurious accommodations for customers that included heated cabins, ornate wood design, and oil paintings to decorate the rooms. She was then purchased by Milwaukee Railway Company. In February 1885, the "Michigan" became entrapped in an ice pack, and a few weeks later, sank in Lake Michigan.
Vessel.
Built by the Detroit Dry Dock Company, in Wyandotte, Michigan, the vessel was constructed with an iron double hull, with separating the two hulls. In addition to the double hull, another safety feature added were five watertight compartments. 123 cabins were built and were said to be the grandest on the lakes, decorated with velvet carpets, furniture and oil paintings. Her powerhouse was an F &amp; AC compound engine with and cylinders and a stroke. Along with the engine was an , boiler built by De Soto &amp; Hutton of Detroit. She displaced 1,024 tons, with a length of and a width of feet. The "Michigan" had a sister ship, the .
Rescue attempt.
In the early months of 1885, a harsh winter had embattled shipping in Lake Michigan. It was typical for Great Lakes shipping trade to halt during the winter months, but an early thaw in February prompted it to resume. As soon as ships left port with cargo, however, a strong winter storm engulfed the region, dropping of snow in two days. This caused many ships to become trapped in ice, including two ships owned by the Milwaukee Railway Company, and one of which being the "Michigan"s sister ship, the "Wisconsin". Knowing the ships and their cargo could be doomed if left to the ice pack, the Milwaukee Railway Company decided to use the "Michigan" and her double hull to break through the ice and free the trapped vessels.
On the morning of February 9, 1885, the "Michigan" and 29 crewmen set up to see if they could free the ships. That same day, a nor'easter gale blew the ship off course and into an ever-growing ice pack. By the morning of the February 11, she was trapped in ice, drifting south. By February 17, conditions remained unchanged, and the crew was quickly exhausting resources. The captain ordered that the sailors ration supplies, and also enlisted a 17-man team to venture across the frozen lake, to land, as the condition of the ship had worsened. The group, using ice picks, axes, and ropes, covered and reached shore in Allegan County, Michigan. On February 21, a resupply ship arrived to restock the trapped "Michigan".
Loss.
February turned to March, and although conditions improved, and ice began to break up, the "Michigan" was still trapped. On March 19, the pressure on the hull was causing the ship to moan, as the double iron hull buckled, and continued throughout the night. A tugboat, the "Arctic" arrived the following day as a last effort to free the "Michigan". The "Arctic" became trapped as well. Late that night, the hull of the "Michigan" became inundated with water, and the captain ordered to abandon ship. All the crew was able to leave the doomed ship and watched as "Michigan" slipped under the ice, to the bottom on Lake Michigan. The crew then waited on the stuck "Arctic" until conditions improved, and the tug was freed. No lives were lost in the sinking.
Discovery of the wreck.
In 2005 the Michigan Shipwreck Research Associates located the wreck of "Michigan" in of water off Holland, Michigan. The discovery was made while MSRA members were scanning the lake bottom with David Trotter of Canton, Michigan, who was also instrumental in the 2001 discovery of the "H.C. Akeley" off Saugatuck. She lies upright on the lake bottom, with her cabin structure collapsed, because of the violent impact with the lake floor when she sank.

Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media

The Minister of Broadcasting, Communications and Digital Media is a minister in the government of New Zealand with responsibility for Television New Zealand and Radio New Zealand. The current Minister is Kris Faafoi, member of the Labour Party. 
History.
In 1936 the First Labour Government decided that broadcasting would be run by the state. As a result a government minister in charge of Broadcasting was appointed and new legislation (the Broadcasting Act 1936) was passed that abolished the existing New Zealand Broadcasting Board and established the new National Broadcasting Service in its place. A Director of Broadcasting was appointed and a Broadcasting Advisory Council formed as a result of the act to advise the minister. The Labour Party had specifically sought to broadcast parliamentary debates via radio as a means of allowing the public to listen and make their own judgment of events, rather than relying solely on the press, whom Labour were distrustful of.
Later the minister oversaw the introduction of television into New Zealand and became responsible for the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC).

Georgina Bowers

Georgina Harriett Bowers (1836–1912) was a Victorian comic illustrator, and one of the first female humourists to be acknowledged professionally. As a child she had a personal connection with animals, and later in life realistic drawings of horses and dogs became common features in her artwork. Bowers is noted most highly for her work as an illustrator for "Punch", though she published many of her own comics as well.
Early life.
Georgina Bowers was a Victorian illustrator born in 1836 in London, England. Her mother died before Bowers got to know her, and her father, George Bowers was the Dean of Manchester, though he was the Rector of St Paul's, Covent Garden at the time of Bowers’ birth.
As a child, Bowers loved country life and animals, which would both become recurring subjects of her later work. From a young age she took an interest in drawing dogs and horses, though her governess discouraged it, insisting instead that she focus on needlework and reading. This proved fruitless, however, and Bowers ended up drawing in most of her free time, of which she had quite a lot.
At 15 she was sent away from home to Derbyshire, where she was tutored privately in subjects such as music, drawing, and German. Here, however, despite being tutored in drawing, she was discouraged yet again from drawing animals. Instead, her teacher only advised her in watercolour sketching, which was deemed more appropriate for a young woman such as herself.
Career.
After her coming out, in which she was presented officially as a woman in society ready to be married, she decided to begin studying at the Manchester School of Art. This was unusual for a woman in her position, and she devoted much of her time to it.
Later she became an illustrator for Punch, working with artists such as Mark Lemon, Shirley Brooks, and John Leech. After Leech died in 1864, however, she moved to Hertfordshire to work and be near the countryside she loved so dearly as a child. This move proved beneficial for her, as she was able to partake in many sporting studies, as well as artistic studies of horses and dogs while hunting. Additionally, Bowers once stated that the vast majority of the jokes in her own publications were inspired by incidents that had occurred while out hunting.
By 1876, Bowers was designing nearly all of the hunting subjects for Punch, and spent her days with her dogs or on horseback, keeping a sketchbook in her saddlebag at all times so that she could draw the animals and scenery around her.
Publications.
Some of Bowers’ publications include (but are not limited to):

Tim Blais

Tim Blais is a Canadian science communicator. He explains scientific topics via writing and performing a capella parodies of popular music which he records and posts on his YouTube channel, "A Capella Science".
Early life and education.
Blais was born in Hudson, Quebec. Blais states that he comes from an "incredibly musical" family. His mother leads a church choir; Blais joined the choir when he was three. He also plays drums, piano, and stringed instruments including guitar. Blais graduated from McGill University in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science degree. In 2013, he earned a master's degree in high-energy theoretical physics with honors from McGill.
Career.
Blais created his first parody video in 2012, motivated by a desire to help people understand the world around them. He states that creating parody videos with a factual science theme came out of being fascinated by science, music (particularly a capella), and parody. He was inspired by "Weird Al" Yankovic, Bill Nye, Mike Tompkins, and Vi Hart. He was also inspired by the group The Maccabeats, an a cappella group that sings parodies of songs with replacement lyrics about Jewish themes. Blais has had an a cappella singing experience with Vancouver's Acapocalypse group.
In his solo videos, Blais performs all the tracks with his own voice, sometimes beat-boxing and creating brass sound effects. Most videos take a few hundred hours to complete.
Blais' first video parody was "Rolling in the Higgs", based on Adele's "Rolling in the Deep". The video was one of a handful of musical creations that followed the 2012 announcement of the discovery of a boson particle with Higgs-like characteristics. Blais' YouTube video generated over 17,000 hits in its first five days and had almost 800 thousand views as of April 2017. The video took Blais 60 hours to complete. Blais' second video, "Bohemian Gravity," parodied Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" to explain string theory. The video features a sock puppet portraying Albert Einstein. The work attracted the attention of Brian May, Queen's guitarist (who also holds a PhD degree in astrophysics), and May posted the video on his website.
Blais' YouTube channel has covered such topics as entropic time, exoplanets, and the discovery of insulin as a treatment for diabetes. Blais has collaborated with Dianna Cowern and others. Although Blais' career in science includes previous employment at the TRIUMF particle accelerator center in Vancouver, Canada, Blais makes a living from creating his videos, being supported by advertising revenue, sales of mp3s and posters, and contributions from fans via the Patreon website.
Blais also does public talks which include performances of his creations and as well as discussions of science culture and his experiences as a science graduate student and an artist in new media. In 2014, he was an artist-in-residence with the National Music Centre in Alberta, during which he experimented with new sounds and recorded tracks for an album. In 2015, he appeared on Canada's reality television program, "Canada's Smartest Person", in which he won his episode but lost in the season finale.

Still Gotta Mean Something

"Still Gotta Mean Something" is the fourteenth episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on April 1, 2018. It was written by Eddie Guzelian and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis.
Plot.
In flashback, Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh) plays dead to save herself from the massacre of the Scavengers by Simon and the Saviors. In the present, she takes time to compose herself before collecting a captive Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and carrying his modified baseball bat, "Lucille", and a suitcase. Negan tries to apologize for what happened to her people, recognizing that Simon had gone against his orders in wiping out the Scavengers, but Jadis is steadfast and threatens to kill him. While she is out of sight, he is able to access her suitcase, containing a gun and pictures from her past, convincing her to talk lest he destroy them with a flare. He reveals that he named his bat after his late wife, Lucille, and, like Jadis' pictures, his bat is the last thing he has to remember his previous life. Jadis' wristwatch beeps, and she suddenly rushes Negan to get the flare, but it is knocked out of their hands into a puddle, and extinguishes. She races off to get another flare as a helicopter hovers briefly overhead before disappearing, too late to see Jadis' second flare. Jadis breaks down into tears, and she lets Negan go; he offers her to come with him and follow a new path, but she refuses. Jadis also refuses to answer Negan's questions about the helicopter.
Meanwhile, the Hilltop community regroups after the Saviors' attack. Tara (Alanna Masterson) unsuccessfully tries to sway Daryl (Norman Reedus) that Dwight is still loyal to them after the attack. Michonne (Danai Gurira) tries to convince Rick (Andrew Lincoln) to read his son Carl's last message to him, but he cannot come to do it. Instead, he decides to locate the escaped Savior prisoners, and Alden (Callan McAuliffe) suggest that he check a nearby bar.
Morgan (Lennie James) feels guilt for Henry's (Macsen Lintz) disappearance, as Henry had been seeking vengeance on Jared (Joshua Mikel), the Savior that killed his brother and Morgan's pupil Benjamin. He goes out to look for him, accompanied by Carol (Melissa McBride). They find a walker with Henry's weapon through it, and Morgan believes Henry must be dead and instead heads further down the road, while Carol goes in the direction the walker came from to find Henry. Morgan meets up with Rick, and while they avoid a walker horde heading towards the bar, they are captured by the escaped Saviors, led by Jared. When Rick and Morgan come to in the bar, they find the Saviors arguing loudly among themselves about returning to the Hilltop. Rick promises amnesty to anyone who wants to return and warns of an approaching horde, but it comes too late as walkers flood the bar. Some of the Saviors cut Rick and Morgan loose of their bonds. Rick helps to eliminate walkers, but then turns on the remaining Saviors. Morgan chases down Jared and purposely traps him in a room with walkers, leaving Jared to die. As they collect themselves, Rick asks Morgan what changed to make him vengeful since their first meeting; Morgan replies that he had his son back then. Meanwhile, Carol is able to find Henry fending off walkers. She helps rescue him and takes him back to the Hilltop for a happy reunion. Rick and Morgan return, and Morgan sullenly informs Henry he killed Jared. Henry says he's sorry, but Morgan tells him to never say one's sorry, and walks off alone. In his room, Rick tearfully reads his letter from Carl.
Elsewhere, Daryl and Rosita (Christian Serratos) discover the Saviors' ammunition factory, where Eugene (Josh McDermitt) is helping to keep their ammo supply going. Daryl and Rosita plot to kill the men running the factory to end the supply. Concurrently, Negan is on route back to the Sanctuary when he finds a familiar face and offers them a ride. Back at Sanctuary, the gate guards are surprised to see Negan alive, believing he had been killed based on what Simon had told them. They let Negan and his passenger in, but Negan tells them not to tell anyone else about his return.
Production.
The scene in which Carol saves Henry from walkers while he is trapped among tree roots mirrors the scene from the season two premiere episode, "What Lies Ahead," in which Rick ushers Carol's daughter, Sophia, into a similar set of tree roots to have her hide from walkers; this was the last time Sophia was seen alive in the series, as she was found turned to a walker in the mid-season finale episode, "Pretty Much Dead Already." Furthering this, Henry is portrayed by Macsen Lintz, the younger brother of Madison Lintz, the actress who portrayed Sophia.
Reception.
Critical reception.
"Still Gotta Mean Something" received generally positive reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 71% with an average rating of 6.73 out of 10, based on 24 reviews. The site's consensus reads: "Though some character motivations remain boggling, a dangerous morality shift between hero and villain -- along with a gratifyingly gruesome death -- make "Still Gotta Mean Something" an enthralling lead-up to the final two episodes of this "The Walking Dead" season."
Ratings.
The episode received a total viewership of 6.30 million with a 2.6 rating in adults aged 18-49, marking a season-low, and the lowest rated episode since the season two episode "Secrets". This was a decrease from the previous week, which had 6.77 million viewers.

Pureair Sanatorium is located in Bayfield County, Wisconsin.
History.
Construction of the sanatorium began in 1918 as an effort to combat tuberculosis. The facility opened in 1920 despite the fact that the construction was not yet finished because the disease had become particularly widespread among the Bad River Band of the Lake Superior Tribe of Chippewa Indians and a nearby community of iron miners. In 1923, additions were added to accommodate World War I veterans who had contracted the disease while overseas. 
The sanatorium ceased operations in 1975. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The site was also added to the state register in 1989.
Pureair, Wisconsin is named after it.

The land had been subject to some clearing activity prior to 1983, but was considered in 2000 as having “regenerated well” and was also reported as being “known for its prolific flowering plants.”
Vegetation in the eastern part of the conservation park was surveyed in 1992 and subsequently described as an "Open Mallee" dominated by "Eucalyptus incrassata" and "Eucalyptus socialis" over an understorey dominated by "Hysterobaeckea behrii". The survey whose site was on a dune crest identified 50 species of native plant and one species of introduced plants within its boundary.
The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category III protected area.

Thingyan rice (, , Thingyan htamin; ) is a traditional Mon dish served during Thingyan, the traditional Burmese New Year. Thingyan rice is infused with water and commonly served with a salad of cured salted fish, which is blanched and fried with onions, along with sour mango or marian plum. The dish is then garnished with roasted chili peppers. Although Thingyan rice originates from the Mon people, it is now commonly prepared throughout Lower Burma.
This festive dish has also been adapted into Central Thai cuisine, where it is known as khao chae.

Southern Tagalog 10

The Southern Tagalog 10 was a group of activists abducted and "disappeared" in 1977 during martial law in the Philippines under Proclamation No. 1081 issued by President of Philippines Ferdinand E. Marcos. Of the 10 university students and professors who were abducted, only three "surfaced" later after being killed by suspected agents of the state. Two of those who surfaced were apparently summarily executed. The rest were never found.
Background.
The victims, most of them in their early twenties, all belonged to a network of community organizations in the Southern Tagalog region, Philippines. They were abducted in late July 1977 at the Makati Medical Center in Metro Manila.
The incident is believed to be the single biggest case of involuntary disappearance during martial law. Bonifacio Ilagan, brother of one of the victims and vice chair of Samahan ng Ex-Detainees Laban sa Detensyon at Aresto (an organization that works for the welfare of political detainees), described the abduction as "the single biggest case of involuntary disappearance and summary execution perpetrated by the Armed Forces of the Philippines in the entire history of the Marcos martial law in the Philippines."
Members.
The ten individuals known as the Southern Tagalog 10 are:
The names of Catalla, Faustino, Rizalina Ilagan, Sales, and Sison are included on the Bantayog ng mga Bayani's Wall of Remembrance for martyrs and heroes of martial law.
In popular culture.
The play "Pagsambang Bayan (People’s Worship)," written by Bonifacio Ilagan, is dedicated to the members of the Southern Tagalog 10. It was first staged in September 1977 at the University of the Philippines (U.P.) by the U.P. Repertory Company under the direction of Behn Cervantes. Its staging led to the arrest of Cervantes and the play's musical director. The play won the Palihang Aurelio V. Tolentino and has since been performed hundreds of times. The Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) cites the play as a "major work in Philippine theater." A musical version of the play was staged in 2017 by director Joel Lamangan at the Polytechnic University of the Philippines and the CCP.
On television, actress Bianca Umali played Rizalina Ilagan in the GMA Network docudrama "Alaala: A Martial Law Special," which first aired on September 17, 2017.

List of Parliamentary constituencies in the North West (region)

The region of North West England is divided into 75 parliamentary constituencies which is made up of 39 Borough Constituencies and 36 County Constituencies. Since the general election of December 2019, 32 are represented by Conservative MPs, 41 by Labour MPs, 1 by a Liberal Democrat MPs, and 1 by the Speaker.
Proposed boundary changes.
The Boundary Commission for England submitted their final proposals in respect of the Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster Constituencies (the 2018 review) in September 2018. Although the proposals were immediately laid before Parliament they were not brought forward by the Government for approval. Accordingly, they did not come into effect for the 2019 election which took place on 12 December 2019, and which was contested using the constituency boundaries in place since 2010.
Under the terms of the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Act 2011, the Sixth Review was based on reducing the total number of MPs from 650 to 600 and a strict electoral parity requirement that the electorate of all constituencies should be within a range of 5% either side of the electoral quota.
On 24 March 2020, the Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Chloe Smith, issued a written statement to Parliament setting out the Government's thinking with regard to parliamentary boundaries. Subsequently, the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 2020 was passed into law on 14 December 2020. This formally removed the duty to implement the 2018 review and set out the framework for future boundary reviews. The Act provided that the number of constituencies should remain at the current level of 650, rather than being reduced to 600, while retaining the requirement that the electorate should be no more than +/- 5% from the electoral quota.
The Act specified that the next review should be completed no later than 1 July 2023 and the Boundary Commission formally launched the 2023 Review on 5 January 2021. The Commission have calculated that the number of seats to be allocated to the North West region will decrease by 2, from 75 to 73.

Cannabis policy of the Lyndon B. Johnson administration

During the administration of American President Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–1969), the government made moves to reconsider cannabis law enforcement in the nation, including a more treatment-based approach to drug use. However, Johnson was saddled with controversies regarding the Vietnam War and internal national tensions, and was not able to make major changes to cannabis policy before declining to run for a second term in 1968. During the Johnson administration, cannabis usage was an issue of concern both in the youth counterculture as well as among American troops serving in the Vietnam War.
Presidency.
Federal Bureau of Narcotics chief Harry Anslinger, a strong opponent of cannabis since the 1930s, left office in 1963, setting the scene for potential evolution of the national cannabis policy.
In 1966, the Johnson administration passed the Narcotics Addict Rehabilitation Act, treating drug abuse as a medical issue similar to alcoholism. Johnson's 1967 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice concluded that the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 was ineffective, and over-broad in lumping cannabis use in with the more dangerous use of opiates. Johnson himself considered the possibility of easing cannabis regulations by removing the mandatory minimum sentencing for cannabis possession.
Throughout Johnson's administration, cannabis use rose sharply, with arrests increasing from 18,815 in 1965 to 61,843 in 1967. In response to the increasing usage of cannabis and other drugs, in 1968 Johnson placed the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (Treasury) and the Bureau of Drug Abuse Control (Food and Drug Administration) under the control of the Department of Justice, consolidating them as the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs.

Drug abuse response team

In the United States, a quick response team (QRT), also known as a drug abuse response team (DART), is an integrated, first responder and community paramedicine unit comprising law enforcement officers, rescue personnel, health care professionals and / or substance abuse counselors.
A QRT is trained to serve as a first responder unit for narcotic-related medical emergencies and, thereafter, to approach and counsel overdose victims during their "recovery windows" — the 72 hours immediately following life-threatening drug overdoses — when users are thought to be more open to accepting help.
At present, QRT and/or DART programs are operating in communities in at least 5 states (see "Proliferation" below).
History.
The QRT deflection model was first developed in 2014, in Colerain Township, Ohio — a 45-square-mile suburb in Hamilton County, just northwest of Cincinnati.
Colerain's then-safety services director, Dan Meloy – who had previously served as the township's police chief and, later, as the township's administrator — oversaw development of its pilot QRT program, in collaboration with the community's assistant fire chief Will Mueller (who is also an adjunct instructor of Fire science at the University of Cincinnati), and CEO Nan Franks and social worker Shana Merrick from the Addiction Services Council of Greater Cincinnati.
Concurrently and independently of the Colerain program, Lucas County, Ohio, developed its similar DART model, which it also first deployed in 2014.
Impetus.
Meloy and other Colerain officials saw the need to develop more innovative, person-centered approaches to reduce the then-sharply rising number of narcotic overdoses in their community, which had been particularly hard-hit by the United States' mid-2010s opioid epidemic.
At the time of the QRT pilot program's development, Colerain Township had approximately 60,000 residents, usually covered by just 33 fire/EMS personnel and 6 patrol officers at any given time.
Whereas in 2011, Colerain reported 51 total overdoses, by 2014 the annual number of overdoses in the community had risen to 141 – a 176% increase in just three years – according to statistics provided in 2016 by the township's Department of Public Safety to the non-profit organization Cover2 Resources, which had asked Colerain to consult as that organization assisted in the development of a similar QRT program in Summit County, Ohio (see "Proliferation" below).
Organization.
In the original Colerain model, a special tactics-trained police officer, a specially-trained firefighter-medic and an addiction counselor from the community were partnered to form a single QRT.
The community's initial QRT emergency responder candidate pool included 6 of the community's firefighter-medics who had previous experience serving as military, SWAT, or Hostage Rescue Team tactical medics (TACMEDs) and 5 police officers with special tactics training (through their service in the military, with SWAT, or on Narcotics Squads).
The chosen firefighter-medics received additional self-defense, chemical irritant deployment and de-escalation training. Special tactics training was deemed necessary, in township officials' estimation, due to the volatile circumstances that often prevail on scene during narcotics-related emergency responses.
Licensed substance abuse counselors were provided to the QRT program through a partnership with the Addiction Services Council of Greater Cincinnati.
The QRT program included a "360 Solution" component, under which all Colerain patrol officers were equipped with nasal-delivery naloxone (Narcan), provided by the Ohio Department of Health and Hamilton County Public Health.
Additionally, the police department canvassed the community several times door-to-door, delivering brochures that informed citizens about the township's efforts to respond to the opioid epidemic.
Colerain's QRT members were trained to use "motivational interviewing" principles – expression of empathy to build rapport with the opiate user, helping the user to elicit the pros and cons of entering treatment, respecting the user's right to choose, and communicating to the user that he or she is capable of change – during their post-incident follow-ups with overdose victims, to attempt to divert users into addiction treatment programs.
They were also trained to identify barriers to treatment, to assist users and their families in preparing to remove or overcome those barriers, to move the user toward a firm commitment to action, and to engage the victim's family and enlist its help in moving the victim to action.
Follow-on counseling encounters were directed to be made in a manner that built trust, maintained discretion and confidentiality, protected the individual's right to choose his or her own care, and complied with all state and federal regulations on patient privacy (i.e.., HIPAA).
Efficacy.
In January through June 2015 (the 6 months immediately preceding the unit's first deployment), Colerain's first responders made 96 overdose-related emergency runs (19 of which involved associated cardiac arrests). In the 6 months immediately following the QRT units' deployment, the township made 71 overdose-related emergency runs (7 of which involved associated cardiac arrests).
Although those initial, positive indications were not sufficient to conclusively prove the pilot program's effectiveness, they were nonetheless encouraging. A subsequent year-over-year analysis lent support to its developers hypothesis that the QRT program could be effective in reducing the number of overdoses in the community.
In January through June 2016, the township made 67 overdose-related emergency runs (just 6 of which involved associated cardiac arrests), representing just over a 30% reduction in such runs from the same 6-month period in the preceding year.
At 2016's year-end, Colerain Township's Department of Public Safety reported that its QRT units had conducted approximately 250 overdose follow-up encounters since July 2015, when the units were first deployed, and that nearly 80% of the users counseled by the unit had entered substance abuse treatment.
Nearby Middletown, Ohio's QRT arguably did not succeed in reducing overdose rates or overdose-related deaths in its first year of operation.
Interviewed by the "Journal-News", Middletown's fire chief, Paul Lolli, noted that in 2016 (the year its QRT was implemented), the city's emergency response agencies made 532 overdose-related runs (comprising 5.7% of its total response volume for that year) with 74 deaths recorded. But, from January 1 – June 17, 2017, the city's agencies had already made 577 opioid overdose responses (comprising 12.4% of its EMS run volume to that point in the year) with 51 recorded deaths.
In 2017, Lucas County sheriff John Tharp stated that that county's DART program had, in the 3 years since its first deployment, achieved a similar success rate, with 74% of contacted individuals having either entered detox or connected with other substance abuse treatment programs.
Proliferation.
The Colerain QRT's initial successes in addressing that township's opiate abuse epidemic garnered close attention from officials in surrounding communities, many of which expressed interest in adopting the model. Within the QRT's first 2 years of operation, communities in North Carolina, northern Ohio, Texas and West Virginia contacted Colerain to inquire about its program.
By June 2016, Ross County, Ohio, and its seat, Chillicothe, had launched their joint, multi-agency Post-Overdose Response Team (PORT), based on Colerain's QRT.
In August 2016, Oxford, Ohio, in Butler County, had "loosely" formed a QRT.
By September 2016, another Cincinnati suburb, Norwood, had developed and deployed a Colerain-model QRT.
In January 2017, the Funders' Response to the Heroin Epidemic – a Greater Cincinnati-based, private funding collaboration operated by InterAct for Change, a nonprofit subsidiary of Interact for Health — awarded both Colerain Township and Clermont County, Ohio, $100,000 grants to support (respectively) their QRT operational and development efforts. Both grants were to be paid over 3 years.
By March 8, 2017, two other Tristate communities — Lawrenceburg, Indiana and Kenton County, Kentucky – had developed and launched their own versions of the QRT program.
In contrast to the Colerain model, Kenton County's QRT – developed by Kenton County Police Department chief Spike Jones and Independence (Ky.) Fire District chief Scott Breeze – was operated by part-time staffers. Unlike Colerain's QRT members, who are full-time employees but also pull normal fire/EMS, police patrol or special tactics team duty, Kenton County's part-time staffers are not responsible for non-QRT duties.&lt;/ref&gt;
Middletown, Ohio, implemented its QRT program in 2016; the city's fire chief, Paul Lolli, reported that 92% of users contacted by the unit had "been able to enter treatment," although he acknowledged that the program had not recorded the results experienced by those who entered treatment, rendering the program's efficacy unclear.
In June 2017, citing opiate addiction as his community's "No. 1 public safety issue," Boone County, Ky., Judge-Executive Gary Moore announced that county's launch of its own Colerain-inspired overdose response team.
By July 2017, several other Ohio communities – including Colerain-neighboring Green Township, the cities of Cincinnati, Cleveland, Hamilton, Mansfield, Oxford and Troy, and Logan and Richland Counties – had developed and implemented QRT programs.
Summit County developed its QRT in partnership with the non-profit drug abuse education and prevention organization Cover2 Resources, with significant advisory support from Colerain Township's Meloy. The county deployed QRT units in Akron, Barberton, Coventry, Cuyahoga Falls, Green, Hudson, Munroe Falls, Norton, Stow and Tallmadge, under partnership agreements with those communities.
Indianapolis and Raleigh had also deployed QRT units as of July 2017.
In June 2017, Butler County Mental Health and Addiction Recovery Services received a $660,000 federal grant, funded by provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act, to develop a mobile overdose response program in that Southwestern Ohio locality.
Also in June 2017, Ohio Governor John Kasich signed into law a state budget that allotted $3 million in grant funding to assist Ohio communities in developing their own QRT or DART programs. The grants were to be administered by the Ohio Attorney General's Office and the initial application period was set to begin in mid-July 2017.
In September 2017, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced that QRT/DART development grants had been awarded to 40 Ohio law enforcement agencies and their partner organizations.
Hancock County received $87,500 and, by the end of the year, its QRT was operational; Ottawa and Wood Counties also received funding. The Mahoning County Sheriff's Office was awarded a $150,000 grant to develop a county-wide QRT program. The Newton Falls Police Department in Trumbull County and the East Liverpool Police Department in Columbiana County each received $50,000 grants.
Tuscarawas County was another of the first communities to receive an Ohio QRT/DART development grant; its sheriff's department was awarded $83,500 to start a county-wide, multi-agency program, which became operational in mid-October 2017.
In December 2017, Meloy resigned from his role as Colerain Township administrator to become an addiction services consultant, helping other communities to start their own QRT programs.
In late December 2017, Huntington, West Virginia, announced that it had developed and implemented a QRT program based on Colerain's model. The city funded its QRT unit through two, 3-year grants: $300,000 from the US Department of Justice and $1.05 million from the US Department of Health &amp; Human Services.
In 2018, following on Huntington's successful QRT implementation, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) awarded an addiction services provider, the Prestera Center, a $263,000 grant to develop a similar overdose intervention program in the Kanawha Valley. DHHR Secretary Bill J. Crouch told West Virginia Public Broadcasting that funding QRTs is "essential part of the DHHR's state opioid response plan," adding that his agency's goal was to, "expand the effort until there's a QRT in every major city in West Virginia."
Also in 2018, Pittsburgh and its surrounding communities began developing their own QRT-inspired, multi-agency response program – the Post Overdose Response Team (POST) — funded in part by the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) Center for Emergency Medicine of Western Pennsylvania via a $150,000 grant from the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. The Congress of Neighboring Communities (CONNECT) — a Pitt-based project that develops programs to address problems shared by Pittsburgh and its several dozen suburbs – will supply community medics and has indicated it will hire a peer recovery specialist to staff the team. Police officers will be provided by the city of Pittsburgh.
In April 2018, the Morgan County, Oh. Sheriff's Department announced that it would begin participating in a county-wide QRT partnership with Morgan Behavioral Health Choices, Allwell Behavioral Health Choices and the Muskingham Area Mental Health and Recovery Services Board.
Recognition.
On June 2, 2017, at its board's annual luncheon, Meloy was presented with the Hamilton County Mental Health and Recovery Services Board's 2017 Leadership Award.
In 2017, Meloy was also honored by the Greater Cincinnati chapter of the American Society for Public Administration (ASPA) for his work in developing Colerain's QRT program. Colerain Township itself received ASPA's Cincinnatus Government Cooperation Award (sponsored by the Cincinnatus Association) for its successful deployment of the QRT model.
On June 11, 2018, Mueller and Colerain's Dept. of Fire &amp; EMS accepted the Ohio Association of County Behavioral Health Authorities' 2018 CARES Award at Ohio's 2018 Opiate Conference.
On June 9, 2018, during the United States Conference of Mayors’ 86th Annual Meeting in Boston, the City of Huntington, W.V. and its mayor, Steve Williams, received the City Livability Awards Program "Outstanding Achievement" honor for the successful deployment of its QRT. First given in 1979, City Livability Awards honor, "mayors and their city governments for developing programs that enhance the quality of life in urban areas," and "are given annually to ten mayors and their cities," according to the Conference's website.

Hypergonadotropic hypergonadism is an endocrine situation and subtype of hypergonadism in which both gonadotropin levels and gonadal function, such as sex hormone production, are abnormally high. It can be associated with hyperandrogenism and hyperestrogenism and with gonadal cysts and tumors. It can be caused by medications such as gonadotropins, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, nonsteroidal antiandrogens, and selective estrogen receptor modulators, as well as conditions like human chorionic gonadotropin-secreting tumors, complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, and estrogen insensitivity syndrome.

Carl Gutwin

Carl Gutwin is a Canadian computer scientist, professor and the director of the Human–computer interaction (HCI) Lab at the University of Saskatchewan. He is also a co-theme leader in the SurfNet research network and was a past holder of a Canada Research Chair in Next-Generation Groupware. Gutwin is known for his contributions in HCI ranging from the technical aspects of systems architectures, to the design and implementation of interaction techniques, and to social theory as applied to design. Gutwin was papers co-chair at CHI 2011 and was a conference co-chair of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) 2010.
Education.
Gutwin has undergraduate degrees in computer science and in English literature. He received his PhD in 1997 from the University of Calgary, where he worked and developed the idea of workspace awareness as a design factor for distributed groupware systems.
Research.
Gutwin's main research areas are in Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), groupware usability, interaction techniques, collaboration support, modelling human performance, information visualization and interface design. Along with his students and collaborators, Gutwin has published more than 200 papers in Human Computer Interaction and Computer Supported Cooperative Work.
KEA: Key Phrase Extraction.
In 1999, Gutwin developed a key phrase extraction algorithm along with Ian Witten, Gordon Paynter, Eibe Frank, and Craig Nevill-Manning called KEA. Key phrases are important to a document as they provide a brief summary of a document's content and as document collections such as digital libraries become larger, the value of such summary information increases. The goal of the algorithm is to help alleviate the tedious process of assigning key phrases manually. The algorithm uses machine learning, lexical methods, and calculates feature values for each candidate to predict which candidates are good key phrases.
Workspace awareness for groupware.
In 2002, Gutwin along with Saul Greenberg, developed a research paper regarding the idea of workspace awareness (the up-to-the-moment understanding of another person's interaction with a shared workspace) and how it can help and improve the usability of a groupware application. The goal of the research was to provide groupware designers a framework about how to design for awareness in multi-user systems, specifically workspace awareness. The developed framework can help educate designers about awareness in groupware and help to improve the quality of the systems that are built.
Group awareness in distributed software development.
In 2004, Gutwin, alongside Reagan Penner and Kevin Schneider, evaluated how distributed developers maintain group awareness (where in the code are they working, what are they doing, and what their plans are). The team interviewed developers and reviewed project artifacts and communications from three open source projects. The findings suggested that developers maintain both a general awareness of the entire team and more detailed knowledge of people that they plan to work with. The primary tools for maintaining awareness were mailing lists and chat tools. The study is one of the first to consider how awareness works in the real world.
Tag clouds.
In 2008, Gutwin along with Scott Bateman and Miguel Nacenta, explored the popular method of tag clouds which help visualize and link socially-organized information on websites. The goal of the research was to find out which visual features of tags draw the attention of viewers. The study was conducted by asking users to select tags from clouds that manipulated nine visual properties. The results showed that font size and font weight have stronger effects than other features such as intensity and number of characters. However, when several visual properties are changed at once, there is no one property that stands out above the others. The study also makes way for general applications such as the visual presentation of hyperlinks as a way to provide more information to web navigators.
Touch-based interaction.
In 2012, Gutwin along with Andy Cockburn and David Ahlstrom, studied the human factors of touch based interactions such as tapping and dragging. The goal of the research was to provide developers a foundational knowledge in this area. The experiment was conducted using three input devices (the finger, stylus, and mouse as a performance baseline) and three different pointing activities which were bidirectional tapping, one-dimensional dragging, and radial dragging (pointing to items arranged in a circle around the cursor). For tapping, the results showed that finger pointing was faster than the stylus/mouse but inaccurate. For dragging, finger input is slower than mouse and stylus. For radial dragging, it was found that task time and movement distance are all linearly correlated with number of items available. Other radial dragging results showed that the stylus is the fastest but had the highest error rate of the three devices.
Awards.
Gutwin was inducted into the ACM CHI Academy for his contributions to HCI research in 2012. In 2015 he was recognized as an ACM Distinguished Researcher.

Sandeq

A Sandeq is a type of outrigger sailboat or trimaran used by the Mandarese people for fishing and as a means of transportation between islands. The size of Sandeq varies, with hulls ranging from long and wide. Its carrying capacity ranges from a few hundred kilograms to over 2 tons. The sleek shape of the Sandeq makes it more agile and faster than other sailboats. The name of the vessel comes from a word in the Mandar language that means pointy, referring to the bow's shape. 
This boat is a well-known piece of maritime cultural heritage to the Mandarese people in West Sulawesi, Indonesia. Before the use of outboard motors, the Sandeq was one of the dominant means travelling between islands of the archipelago, not only because of its smoothness and speed, but also thanks to its ability to sail close-hauled almost directly against the direction of the wind. The zig-zag technique called beating in English is called "Makkarakkayi" in the Mandar language. Although Mandarese seafarers have developed many types of boats, both big and small, the Sandeq is the only fully wind-powered vessel that is still commonly used in West Sulawesi today.
The two smaller outrigger hulls serve to balance the vessel, which relies on the wind force captured by the triangular sail. The Sandeq can reach speeds of up to . 
A Sandeq is also able to survive the wind and waves while chasing a herd of tuna. During the fishing season, skippers use Sandeq to trap eggs from a series of coconut leaves and seaweed. The Sandeq can also be used to collect spices from Ternate and Tidore to be delivered to the city of Makassar.
Every year, a Sandeq race is held in mid-August. The route from Mamuju, West Sulawesi to Makassar, South Sulawesi covers a distance of .

Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring

Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring, founded in 1731, was the first Danish provider of fire insurances in Denmark. It existed as an independent enterprise until 1976 and is now part of Tryg. The company's last headquarters was the Gustmeyer House at Ved Stranden 14 in central Copenhagen.
History.
The Copenhagen Fire of 1728 devoured around 28% of the buildings in Copenhagen. The merchants Hans Henrik Bech (c. 1699 - 1783) and Hans Hansen Berg (1688-1736) proposed a fire insurance scheme and Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring was founded by royal resolution on 26 January 1731. The fire insurance was instrumental in speeding up the rebuilding of the city since lending out money for construction projects became less risky. The first building was insured on 21 December 1731 by Otto Blome at Amagertorv 4.
Kjøbenhavns Brandforsikring was originally only active in the market for fire insurance of buildings located inside the City Walls but from 1889 it gradually opened up for fire insurances of buildings in Frederiksberg and a number of surrounding districts.
The company was based in the Gustmeyer House at Ved Stranden 14 and its last CEO was Frits Pedersen. The company merged with Danmark/Tryg/Fremtiden G/S under the name Tryg Forsikring in 1976.

Anne Edmonds

Anne Elizabeth Gabrielle Edmonds (born 11 October 1979) is an Australian comedian and actor best known for her stand-up work and for creating and starring in the ABC comedy series "The Edge of the Bush". Beginning her career in comedy at 29 (2010) after working in mental health in rural Australia, Edmonds uses her suburban background, singing/songwriting and storytelling to create a fearless, self-deprecating and often macabre stand up voice. Humiliation and despair are central themes to Edmonds' comedy, as are stories of teenage mischief, sex, failure, relationships and loneliness.
Early life.
Raised Catholic in the Melbourne suburbs of Essendon and Strathmore, Edmonds studied at The University of Melbourne, completing a Bachelor of Arts Degree and Honours in Social Work. 
Career.
Edmonds has performed extensively at Australian festivals including the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, Adelaide Fringe, Brisbane Comedy Festival and Sydney Comedy Festival, and toured internationally multiple times, performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe and the Soho Theatre, London. Edmonds's solo stand-up shows have received multiple nominations for the Barry Award, an annual prize presented for the most outstanding comedy show at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival.
The comedian is known for her character work, most notably Helen Bidou, an emotionally unstable, sarong-wearing, fashion expert who was featured on the ABC hit comedy show "Get Krack!n". A full length live performance, "Helen Bidou: Enter the Spinnaker Lounge", exposed a dark familial relationship with her son Connor (Sam Campbell), and received a Barry Nomination and Sydney Comedy Festival Best Show Award.
Other characters created by the comedian include John Watts, Dusty Banjosen and Rebecca, all of which feature on her original ABC show "The Edge of the Bush". Billed as "Australia's first Scandi-noir comedy", it was called "bizarre but satisfying" by "Daily Review". The show tells of a callisthenics dynasty which has been torn apart by incest, as a family is forced back into reunion by confronting the truth of what really occurred at the edge of the bush.
As well as appearing solo, Edmonds is also a part of a satirical trio called True Australian Patriots with fellow comedians Greg Larsen and Damien Power. A mock-Australian patriots group on Facebook and YouTube, the characters Les, Steve and Gary are portrayed as inarticulate whilst spewing nonsense hate speech. Edmonds commented on the reception to the trio: "The real groups are ripe for parody... We get a lot of people who think it's real which is disturbing. Ours is a complete parody but we get people who go 'You guys suck. Stop it', from both sides... Those groups are appalling and we're hoping to show the mis-information that they are spreading. I find that far-right voice in Australia really distressing".
Edmonds stars and has contributed to "Fancy Boy", an Australian six-part sketch comedy television series. Edmonds starred and co-wrote "Fancy Boy" alongside John Campbell, Stuart Daulman, Henry Stone, Jonathan Schuster and Greg Larsen. She is one of the voices in the Australian version of cult US Adult Swim show "Fish Centre".
Edmonds has made guest appearances on "All Star Family Feud", "Celebrity Name Game", "Dirty Laundry Live", "The Project", "Show Me the Movie!", "Have You Been Paying Attention?" and "Hughesy, We Have a Problem". Her solo standup show "What's Wrong With You?" debuted on Amazon Prime Video in 2020.
Edmonds supported Marc Maron on his 2015 Australian tour.
Music.
Edmonds is a singer-songwriter and incorporates this into her comedy work. Most notable is her song "Flying Home", which was featured in ABC's "The Edge of the Bush" and is available on iTunes.

Sambia Sexual Culture

Sambia Sexual Culture: Essays from the Field is a 1999 book about the Sambia people and their sexual practices by the anthropologist Gilbert Herdt. The book received negative reviews, accusing Herdt of being biased in his approach and his conclusions.
Summary.
Herdt discusses the culture of the Sambia people. His work is influenced by the philosopher Michel Foucault.
Publication history.
"Sambia Sexual Culture" was first published in 1999 by the University of Chicago Press.
Reception.
"Sambia Sexual Culture" received a mixed review from Glenn Petersen in "Library Journal", and negative reviews from the anthropologist Jadran Mimica in the "Australian Journal of Anthropology" and the philosopher James Giles in the "Archives of Sexual Behavior". The book was also reviewed by Alexandra A. Brewis in "American Anthropologist", Andrew P. Lyons in "Anthropologica", and Paul Sillitoe in the "Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute", and discussed by Nathaniel McConaghy in the "Archives of Sexual Behavior".
Petersen credited Herdt with providing "a good deal of theoretical discussion of sexual identity in a cross-cultural framework", and with taking "great care to relativize the homosexual aspects" of the Sambia's ritual practices. However, he criticized Herdt for providing little "commentary on the matter of elders taking sexual advantage of children", noting that the issue was "a topic of considerable immediacy in contemporary America."
Mimica considered Herdt's approach to Sambia culture biased. Though she complimented his discussions of topics such as the use of secret flutes in "Sambia man-making practices", the practice of nose-bleeding, "male fears of semen depletion", and "Sambia semen transactions", she found other parts of his work flawed, writing that while they contained interesting information, they were "limited by a naive mechanistic-functionalist conceptual framework dependent on uncritically accepted differentiations between 'biological', 'psychological', 'symbolic', 'cultural' and 'social' levels of human existence and ... such pseudo-Aristotelian notions as 'ultimate' and 'proximate' causes". She accused him of "prevarications and exaggerations about his methodology and data", and found his ideas about the Sambia incompletely worked out. She criticized his failure to make a systematic study of the Sambia language or to properly discuss this failure, and argued that despite his use of psychoanalysis and the influence of Foucault on his work, his framework was nevertheless basically "positivist". She considered him incorrect to describe Sambia culture in terms of categories such as the sacred, the profane, and the supernatural. She concluded that his book was "yet another volume in yet another series on the increasingly sterilised and sterilising academic topics of sexuality, gender, and culture."
Giles argued that Herdt's view that Sambia boys give up their homosexual desires and acquire heterosexual desires when they become young men conflicts with the conclusion, supported by Alan P. Bell, Martin S. Weinberg, and Sue Kiefer Hammersmith in "Sexual Preference" (1981) and John C. Gonsiorek and James D. Weinrich in "Homosexuality: Research implications for public health policy" (1991), that sexual orientation is set in early childhood. He questioned Herdt's view that Sambia culture determined the sexual desires of Sambia males, and accused Herdt of bias. He criticized Herdt for ignoring nonsexual desires that might motivate Sambia sexual behavior. He argued that the Sambia's sexual rituals are coercive, and that this should "make us suspicious of claims that the homosexual activities performed during or as a result of the ritual in any way reflect the participant’s real sexual desires." He criticized Herdt's argument that the "bawdy enthusiasm" showed by Sambia boys who participate in the rituals shows that their behavior is motivated by erotic desire, noting that "child victims of adult or adolescent sexual abuse are often willing, and even enthusiastic, participants in the sexual acts that they are manipulated into performing". Though finding "Sambia Sexual Culture" fascinating, he concluded that Herdt failed to support his main conclusions about Sambia sexual culture.
McConaghy criticized Giles for assuming that people are either heterosexual or gay and ignoring the existence of people with both heterosexual and homosexual desires. However, he agreed with Giles that the homosexual behavior of many of the boys may not have been motivated by sexual desire, as well as his criticism of Herdt's idea that culture can implant sexual desires through deep scripting. McConaghy further stated that the distribution of homosexual feelings could be the same in both Sambia and Western culture.

Western Front (RSFSR)

The Western Front () was a front of the Red Army during the Russian Civil War and Polish-Soviet War, which existed between February 12, 1919 and April 8, 1924. The Western Front was first established on the basis of the administration of the disbanded Northern Front. The Front headquarters were located consequently in Staraya Russa, Molodechno, Dvinsk, Smolensk and Minsk . 
Operations.
At the time of the formation of the Western Front, Soviet troops were fighting on a front some 2,000 km long, stretching from Murmansk (against the White Northern Army and the Entente interventionists), over the Karelian Isthmus (against Finland), and the Baltics to the Belarussian Front (against Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian formations and Russian White Guards, supported by German and Polish troops). 
By July 1919, the Soviet Armies of the Western Front had retreated from the Baltic area under the onslaught of the enemy. In Belarus, the Polish offensive was stopped in August on the Berezina River. In August 1919 the Front forces were on the line of the Gulf of Finland-Pskov-Polotsk-Berezina river.
In June-August and October-November 1919, the 7th and 15th Armies, supported by the ships of the Baltic Fleet, repelled two offensives of the White Northwestern Army under Yudenich against Petrograd and defeated it, which allowed the concentration of the main efforts of the Red Army in the fight against the armies of Denikin and Kolchak.
In 1920, the Western Front became the main front of the Soviet Republic and it participated in repelling the offensive of the Polish Army during the Soviet-Polish War. The May operation (1920) of the Western Front, although it did not achieve its goals, created favorable conditions for a successful counteroffensive of the troops of the South-Western Front in Ukraine.
As a result of the July operation (1920) of the Western Front, Belarus and parts of Lithuania were occupied, and in August 1920 the troops of the Western Front approached Warsaw. However, the reassessment by the Soviet command of its forces and the underestimation of the enemy's forces, as well as bad coordination between the Western and South-Western Fronts, led to the defeat of the Soviet troops of the Western Front in the Battle of Warsaw (1920) and their withdrawal.
Despite the defeat of the Red Army, Poland didn't continue the War and a truce was signed on 12 October, which enabled the Red Army to concentrate its main forces against Wrangel's troops around the Crimean Peninsula.
The Western Front and its administration continued to exist after the end of hostilities, until it was transformed into the Western Military District on April 8, 1924.
