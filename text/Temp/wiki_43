Teatralnaya (Saint Petersburg Metro)

Teatralnaya () is a station that is under construction on Line 4 of the Saint Petersburg Metro. It is in the Admiralteysky District of Saint Peterburg and is currently planned to open in 2023. It is named for Teatralnaya Ploshchad, or Theater Square, which is the location for several theaters, including the Mariinsky Theatre.
Design and Layout.
The station will have two lobbies, one near the Mariinsky Theater and the second under Ulitsa Dekabristov.
Construction.
Initial plans called for the station to open sometime from 2015 to 2016. In late 2010, the city pushed the opening date back to 2017. An initial assessment suggested that 42 buildings could be at risk from the construction. Consequently, the bid documents from the city required the construction company to shore up foundations for some of the buildings on the square.
Metrostroy, the lead construction company, began work on one of the tunnels from Spasskaya in February 2017. That tunnel was completed in December 2017.
In March 2018, work on the second tunnel hit a snag when workers walked off the job over unpaid wages. Workers reportedly had no been paid in three months. The construction company was unable to pay its workers when its accounts were frozen over accusations of unpaid taxes. With assistance from the Federal government, workers received their wages a week later.

Aeromarine M-1

The Aeromarine M-1 was a two-seat training biplane ordered by the US Army's Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps (USAAS) in 1917 and built by the Aeromarine Plane and Motor Company of Keyport, New Jersey.
Design and development.
Originally known as Aeromarine Training Tractor, Aeromarine's chief designer, Charles F. Willard, designed a two place trainer in both land-plane and seaplane configuration. The land plane was designated the Aeromarine M-1 and was produced to US Army Specification No.1001. The seaplane version was later called the Aeromarine 39 and sold to the United States Navy (USN). Both aircraft shared much in common, aside from the undercarriage, the primary difference was that the M-1's wingspan was shorter than the Aeromarine 39.
Operational history.
Six aircraft were produced and assigned serial numbers 265/270. During Army testing, the aircraft proved to be unsuitable for a training. "Preliminary tests showed that the M1 was unstable in anything but level flight, and most spent the war years packed in their crates."
In 1920, there was a proposal to re-engine these aircraft with the Aeromarine 100hp motor

Tha Din Daeng, Bangkok

Tha Din Daeng (, ) is a market and one of oldest neighbourhoods in Bangkok. It is in the Somdet Chao Phraya and Khlong San Subdistricts of Khlong San District on the Thonburi side (west bank of the Chao Phraya River).
History.
Tha Din Daeng dates back to the early Ayutthaya period (reigns of King Uthong to Intharacha). This area was a stop for cargo ships traveling from the Chao Phraya's mouth to Ayutthaya.
In the Rattanakosin period Tha Din Daeng was considered a prime location for commerce and industry. The area along the Chao Phraya, from Tha Din Daeng to the estuary, was home to many factories and businesses, such as rice mills, sawmills, warehouses, and docks. The traders in the area were mostly Chinese and Malays. King Mongkut (Rama IV) later encouraged European settlements.
Tha Din Daeng is home to many Thai Chinese, like other similar settlements such as Bangkok Chinatown, Yaowarat, Sampheng, Talat Noi, and Talat Phlu. Here there is a ferry that crosses from Rachawong pier (N5) in Sampheng. There are three shrines: Shiva Shrine, Sam Nai Keng Joss House (), the oldest Hakka's joss house in Bangkok, built in 1847, and Pung Tao Kong Joss House (本頭公廟).
Tha Din Daeng Road was built in 1931 during King Prajadhipok's (Rama VII) reign after the construction of Memorial bridge linked Phra Nakhon and Thonburi. The road was named by Prince Damrong to recall King Rama I's victories over the Burmese Army (Tha Din Daeng campaign).
Tha Din Daeng is home to many restaurants and street food vendors selling pork satay, pot-stewed goose and duck, milk café, "bok kia" (a kind of Hainan-style ice dessert), and " Phra ram long song" (พระรามลงสรง, rice topped with scalded pork and scalded water spinach and topped with satay sauce and "nam phrik phao").

Disappearance of Jamie Fraley

In the early hours of April 8, 2008, Jamie Fraley (born March 5, 1986), of Gastonia, North Carolina, United States, told a friend over the phone that she was going to the hospital for the third time in the last 24 hours due to a stomach flu. When asked who was taking her there, Fraley said it was another friend and declined to further identify that person. She has not been seen since; her cellphone was found a few days later but provided no useful information as to her whereabouts.
Investigators initially believed she had met with foul play, and began focusing on Ricky Simonds Sr., her fiancé's father, who lived in the same apartment complex, as a person of interest. He had driven Fraley to the hospital on one of her previous visits that day, and had a criminal record that included prison time for manslaughter after he had strangled a girlfriend in the 1980s. However, the investigation ended two months later when Simonds was found dead, apparently of heat stroke, in the trunk of a former girlfriend's car.
In 2015, a prison inmate confessed that he had killed Fraley, but he was incarcerated at the time Fraley disappeared. The investigation continues, and in 2012 the case was the subject of an episode of the Investigation Discovery channel's "Disappeared".
Background.
A native of Gaston County, Fraley had struggled with anxiety and bipolar disorder throughout her early life. By the late 2000s, Fraley had responded well to prescription medications for those conditions and was attending Gaston College on a part-time basis. According to her family, she was planning on a career as a substance-abuse counselor.
In 2006 she had begun dating Ricky Simonds Jr. Her family said she was very much in love with him, and eventually the two became engaged. However, Simonds had a criminal history, and after several earlier arrests for petty crimes, in early 2007 he was sentenced to 15 months in state prison for theft. Fraley continued to visit and interact with him while he was incarcerated.
Disappearance.
On April 7, 2008, Fraley came down with a stomach virus. It was severe enough that she twice sought treatment at a local hospital that day. As she had no driver's license, she relied on a social services worker, and friends and family to take her to and from the hospital.
After returning from the first trip, one of Fraley's friends visited her and picked up her dog, which Fraley had been sitting for her, then went out to drop off Fraley's prescription at a local drugstore. She went back later; Ricky Simonds Sr., her incarcerated fiancé's father, who lived in the same apartment complex and did maintenance work there, drove her there and another neighbor drove her back. Fraley decided around 12 a.m. that she had something more serious and needed to go back to the hospital, and called her mother to let her know. At 1:30 a.m. April 8, she called a friend in Albemarle; during the call she mentioned that she was going back to the hospital. The call was cut short when Fraley apparently saw her ride, whom she referred to as "he", arrive.
Fraley never checked into the hospital the third time. Since that phone call, there has been no evidence of her presence anywhere.
Investigation.
After Fraley missed an important appointment the next day, her family went to her apartment on Lowell-Bethesda Road to see if she was alright. They did not find her there. The door was locked; inside they found her wallet, purse, keys, and identification, but not her cell phone. Nothing else was missing. There were no signs of a struggle, so they concluded she had left willingly, wherever she had gone. Unable to locate her, they called police and reported her missing.
Gaston County police launched a major investigation, putting all its investigators on the case, with three of them devoted to it full-time, and requesting assistance from both the state's Bureau of Investigation and the FBI. "I have never seen a missing person case worked this thoroughly", said Christie Rhoney, the chief detective. Two days after Fraley's disappearance, utility workers discovered her phone at an intersection roughly a mile (1.6 km) from her apartment.
By the time the phone was turned over to the police, too many people had handled it for any usable evidence, such as fingerprints, to be gained from the exterior. Searching through its call records, police found that several calls had been made at 4:30 a.m. However, they turned out to be from the list of calls Fraley had dialed earlier and were not connected to the disappearance. A call had been made to the phone at 5 a.m., but it could not be determined who it was from.
Ricky Simonds Sr..
Ricky Simonds Jr., Fraley's fiancé, was still imprisoned at the time of her disappearance, so investigators ruled him out as a suspect. They quickly refocused on his father, Ricky Simonds Sr. He, too, had a criminal record, including six years in prison for manslaughter in the 1980s after strangling a girlfriend to death.
Simonds Sr. lived in the same complex as Fraley, just two doors away, and did maintenance work there. He had driven her to the hospital the second time on the day she disappeared, making him one of the last people to see her that day. Reportedly he was obsessed with Fraley. He refused to take a lie detector test.
Two months to the day after Fraley disappeared, however, the investigation into Simonds ended with his death. On June 7, Kim Sprenger, a former girlfriend who had recently obtained a protective order against him, noticed a foul odor in her car. It persisted, and the next day she opened the trunk. Inside, Sprenger found Simonds' body. Police investigating found he had a set of her car keys; a week earlier Sprenger's purse had been stolen from the car. The cause of death was ruled to be accidental heat stroke; during the previous days, high temperatures in the area had exceeded .
Police theorized that Simonds had used the keys to let himself into the trunk with the intent of ambushing Sprenger at some point, letting himself out with the working emergency latch. When heat exhaustion set in, however, it was possible that he had panicked and forgotten to use it, remaining in the trunk to die. After completing their investigation into Simonds' death, detectives told the media that he had been considered a person of interest in Fraley's disappearance, which remained an open case.
Members of both the Fraley and Simonds families believed Ricky Sr. had taken useful information about what happened to Fraley to his grave. Her mother, Kim, who had supplemented the official investigation with efforts of her own, recalled crying when she learned of his death.
Ricky Sr., she claimed, "was hiding something and we couldn't never get that out of him". Ricky Simonds Jr., by then released from prison, also said he believed his father, whom he described as being more of a friend, was aware of what had happened to Fraley, but generally found the unusual chain of circumstances overwhelming. "[F]irst my fiancé goes missing, then my dad climbs in a trunk and dies? Does that make sense to anybody?" he asked a local TV station.
2015 possible confession.
In 2015, Jerry Case, a man then serving federal prison time for kidnapping, made a possible confession regarding Fraley's disappearance; he had been incarcerated at that time.
When he confessed, Case was on trial for a 1985 murder in Gaston County which he had confessed to in a 2012 letter to the "Gaston Gazette". In 2015 he wrote another letter to the "Gazette", confessing to killing Fraley and another local woman who had been shot and killed in her house, which was then set on fire later that year. "I guess you could say this is confessions number two and three", he wrote.
Prosecutors immediately dismissed Case's confession as unlikely regarding Fraley, since he was incarcerated at the time she disappeared (although he was released a few weeks later) and he only provided details of the case that had already been made public. They also discounted his marginally probable confession regarding the later murder of the other local woman, though he had been free at the time the later homicide occurred.

Mandatory Brunch Meeting

"Mandatory Brunch Meeting" is the seventeenth episode of the fourth season and 83rd episode overall from the Fox series "Gotham".

The episode received critical acclaim, with critics lauding Monaghan’s performances as Jerome and Jeremiah and the introduction of the latter.
Plot.
Bruce (David Mazouz) arrives at St. Ignatius, the school that Jerome's (Cameron Monaghan) next target, "Xander Wilde", attended. The Headmaster (Steven Hauck) reveals that he has already given information regarding Wilde to Jerome.
Jerome holds a meeting with Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor), Tetch (Benedict Samuel), Fries (Nathan Darrow), Pike (Michelle Veintimilla), and Crane (David W. Thompson). He reveals his plans to wreak havoc in the city before invading Wilde's engineering offices in search of him. Jerome arrives at Wilde's proxy's apartment but is knocked unconscious, and subsequently wakes up in a cell with Wilde watching him via CCTV cameras. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) and Bullock (Donal Logue) arrive at the control room in the underground facility and confront Wilde, who looks exactly like Jerome. Wilde is revealed to be Jeremiah Valeska (also played by Monaghan), Jerome's twin brother. Jeremiah claims to have suffered severe abuse at Jerome's hands throughout his childhood, forcing their mother to send Jeremiah away to be adopted and renamed "Xander Wilde". Jerome's allies arrive and free Jerome, who vows to drive Jeremiah mad.
Lee (Morena Baccarin) challenges Nygma (Cory Michael Smith) to his game, the Riddle Factory, and wagers to abolish it if she wins. After she outsmarts Nygma, the two share a kiss. Jeremiah is placed into protective custody with the help of GCPD. Cobblepot recruits Grundy (Drew Powell) for the Legion.

Homer Is Where the Art Isn't

"Homer Is Where the Art Isn't" is the twelfth episode of the twenty-ninth season of the American animated television series "The Simpsons", and the 630th episode of the series overall. It aired in the United States on Fox on March 18, 2018. It is the final episode written by long time writer Kevin Curran, who died in 2016. The episode is dedicated to Stephen Hawking, who died four days before the episode's airing.
Plot.
At Gavelby's Auction House, Homer and Mr. Burns lose to tech mogul Megan Matheson at bidding for Joan Miró's painting "The Poetess", with which Homer is obsessed, to the point of attempting to steal the painting at the end of the auction. Once the painting arrives at her home, Megan finds out that it has been stolen. Polish-American Detective Manacek is called to solve the case.
Manacek goes to Megan's due to insuring the painting for double the price she paid of $30 million. She denies the accusation and sends Manacek to Burns' mansion. He shows he can't stand losing a bid to a woman, but dismisses the accusation too and sends Manacek to the final suspect, Homer, due to the obsession he showed about it. Homer demonstrates to him how much he wants the painting at the Power Plant, but denies stealing it. In the evening, Marge shows up at Manacek's apartment Brick Townhomes to convince him Homer is innocent, but he says they'd only talk at dinner. So Marge invites him to dinner at her house with their family.
After dinner, Homer panics when they start talking, and Bart and Marge explain how Homer became obsessed with the painting at the Springfield Museum of Fine Arts while chaperoning a field trip there, even dreaming about it at night. Lisa then reveals that Homer confided in her about the painting, forming a common interest between them. The two then went to the museum, only to find it closed due to being out of funds and the painting shipped off to an auction house. Springfielders protested on the museum's closure while Mayor Quimby explained the cuts, including the cut of 1/3 of the Springfield Police Department with Eddie having been fired, resulting in them giving up on the protests. Homer then decided to enter the auction in a bid to save the painting, where the scene returns to the start of the episode where the bids took place, and Homer tried to steal it.
After the story, Homer escapes from home, but Manacek finds him at the museum where he assures him he's innocent because he finds him too dumb to steal anything. Manacek later gathers all the suspects together in the museum and reveals that Megan and Burns are the thieves of the painting. Megan exchanged the security guards by twins hired by her, to simulate the steal, so she could collect the insurance policy for her girlfriend. However, Burns beat her to it when he built an identical auction house next to the original and stole it from the vault.
After Megan and Burns are arrested and the painting is retrieved from Burns' manor, Manacek reveals the true culprit to be none other than Lisa herself, as the painting is nothing other than her tote bag. Lisa explains that she secretly switched the painting before the auction happened, so it wouldn't go to millionaires' houses hidden away from people who love it, like Homer. As ownership of the painting reverts to the city, it is returned to Mayor Quimby, who chooses to preserve it at the Springfield Arena Football Arena, built with the money from selling the public arts, where Homer and Lisa happily go to view the painting together.
During the credits, there are different shots of Manacek as if they are part of a detective TV show. In one of those scenes Manacek receives in awe the golden Polish-American Man of the Year Trophy that is topped with an iconic Polish food, a pieróg, more commonly known by its plural form pierogi.
Reception.
Dennis Perkins of "The A.V. Club" gave this episode a B, stating, "At this point in its record-setting run, "The Simpsons" is entitled—encouraged, even—to muck about with its format all it wants. Here, the series’ traditional linear sitcom storytelling style is upended, from the classic theme song right on through. Starting out with Homer, fancy duds and ping pong paddle at the ready, bidding millions of dollars for Joan Miró's abstract painting "The Poetess", being outbid by first Mr. Burns and then ‘billionaire tech mogul’ Megan Matheson (Cecily Strong), and, enraged, being dragged out by security bellowing, ‘Don’t take that painting, I love it’—clearly, there's a mystery here. Both as to the hows and whys of Homer J. Simpson being involved in high-end art intrigue, and to what form this rejiggering of the "Simpsons" formula is taking. It's neat."
"Homer Is Where the Art Isn't" scored a 0.8 rating with a 3 share and was watched by 2.10 million people, making it Fox's second-highest-rated show of the night.
Retired "Akron Beacon Journal" writer Rich Heldenfels called the episode "a dead-on parody of Banacek."

Chłopaki Nie Płaczą (video game)

Boyz Don't Cry (Polish: Chłopaki Nie Płaczą) is an adventure video game developed by L'Art, released on March 30, 2005.
Development.
Warsaw-based L'Art employs 25 people. It is known within the Anglosphere for publishing localized versions of video games like "Myst III", "Nocturne" and "Hopkins FBI". The company initially focused on local game versions and multimedia presentations in order to increase funding for a new, unique video game. The company finalized this game while developing "Ski Jumping 2005" and two games set in the modern theatre of war. Maciej Oginski finished writing the game's screenplay and dialogue in December 2003. The development process officially began a few months later.
Oginski aimed to write a script in the style of Monty Python and "South Park" that would be enjoyable to those who had not seen the earlier films. The finished script consisted of 500 pages, and voice actors recorded over five hours of dialogue, filled with slang, newspeak and expletives. 
Developers chose to make the game in 2D as they were against 3D and felt FMV was tacky. It was reported in a Just Adventure preview, published August 19, 2004, that the company hoped to find a North American publisher for the game. They ended up publishing the title themselves. The game was originally meant to be published in Poland in September 2004.
Plot and gameplay.
The game is loosely based on the comedy film "Chłopaki nie płaczą" (2005) and centers on a duo of gangsters named Fred and Grucha.
Gameplay is similar to a classic two-dimensional LucasArts adventure game, where players interact with characters, collect inventory items and complete puzzles to advance the story.
Critical reception.
Przygodoskop thought the game would appeal to players who just wanted a fun experience, noting that it "wasn't ambitious, intellectual, or a milestone". GryPC wrote that the game's script could reasonably be used as a sequel to the film "Chłopaki nie płaczą". "Game Press" gave specific praise to the title's "Polonization" for its emphasis on appealing to Polish players and including historical or cultural references they would likely appreciate. Adventure Gamers enjoyed the title's "gorgeous [...] sumptuous looking stylized artwork." Gry.imro thought it was the best Polish adventure game in years. Imperium Gier praised the game's humour and cast of characters, but disliked the plot and gameplay. Gry.mocny disliked the "annoying" interface but appreciated how the game was not merely a straight remake of the film. Gra.pl noted the game's humor contained a large amount of social and political satire.

Blue Nile patas monkey

Erythrocebus poliophaeus is a purported species of Old World monkey found in Africa along the Blue Nile river valley in Ethiopia and Sudan. While first described in 1862, it was synonymized with the patas monkey in 1927. A 2017 study reclassified it as a distinct species. It has the identical distinctive hair on its the face as the nominate patas monkey, resembling a handlebar moustache.
Taxonomy.
Patas monkey classification was questioned by Gippoliti in 2017, who claimed that previous taxonomic decisions were based on a single type specimen. The first widely adopted taxonomy was created by Schwartz through his research in 1927. All "Erythrocebus" monkeys were classified into three subspecies: "patas", "pyrrhonotus" and "baumstarki," creating a monotypic genus.
The type specimen of "poliophaeus" was originally collected in Darfur, western Sudan (far from the Blue Nile), according to the animal dealer the specimen came from. It had a somewhat lighter coat than the standard form, and was hence given a separate species status in a 1862 book by Heinrich Gottlieb Ludwig Reichenbach.
"Erythrocebus" subspecies were originally classified by their nose colour. Around 1974, it was noticed that nose colour could actually change due to age or physiology, which meant that upholding the separate status of the different subspecies was no longer justified, although for many the previous classification was left unchanged. Conventionally, the subspecies are distinguished by facial hair and skin colour. Like the nominate form of patas monkey, this form has white hairs on upper lip hair which forms the shape of a handlebar moustache. In subspecies "baumstarki", this moustache is black. Both the nominate form and ssp. "baumstarki" have all-black noses, whereas this form has a white spot on the nose. In 2017 Gippoliti resurrected "E. poliophaeus" as a separate species based on the above characteristics of "pyrrhonotus", which according to him restricted the taxon to eastern Al Qadarif and Sennar wilayati and neighbouring edges of Ethiopia, based largely on scant photographic evidence. Gippoliti also considers his restriction of the taxon to this area to be a characteristic of the taxon, which he then bases the taxon on. Other reasons given for the taxonomic change is to attract attention and perhaps funding to these monkeys, and by chopping off taxa from the otherwise common and legally tradable patas monkey, and declaring them endangered, taxonomy could be used for conservation purposes.
Gippoliti proposed to name his new species with common names Heuglin's patas monkey or the Blue Nile patas monkey.
Conventionally, researchers apply ssp. "pyrrhonotus" to all patas monkeys from northeastern Africa, including Sudan, Ethiopia, Kenya and Uganda. Gippoliti restricts the name "poliophaeus" from those populations found in northwestern Ethiopia and eastern Sudan, although he also provisionally resurrects the taxon "formosa" subsumed as a subspecies of "poliophaeus"for monkeys from southwestern Ethiopia and Uganda -based on a photo and anecdotes, these animals might have somewhat darker coats than those found somewhat further north, and may often lack the white nose which characterises this taxon. Gippoliti also raises ssp. "pyrrhonotus" and "baumstarki" to the level of species in passing, without detailing any taxonomic motivations.

Joe Asselin

Joe Asselin (born 1977, Manchester, New Hampshire, United States) is an American Chicago blues and electric blues musician based out of Champaign, Illinois. He has appeared on five releases with the Blues Music Award-nominated Kilborn Alley Blues Band, with three of them being produced by fellow blues musician Nick Moss at his Blue Bella Records label. He was also a part of the International Blues Challenge finalist group the Sugar Prophets from 2011-2013. More recently he has worked with several other Champaign-based local blues, rock, and country bands and released his own solo acoustic album "Blue Genes" in 2016.
Biography.
Asselin originally learned how to play keyboards and harmonica when he was eight years old. While living in Litchfield, New Hampshire, he supposedly picked up the harmonica after stealing one out of his older brother Mark's glove box in his car. Music was a large part of his early family life. His brother Mark worked for the alternative band Cold as their guitar tech throughout the 1990s and also plays guitar.
Before moving to Illinois, Asselin played with the short-lived American Folk Project as the singer, harmonica player, and acoustic guitar player. After turning 22, Asselin came to Illinois in search of playing blues music. He connected with the Kilborn Alley Blues Band in Champaign in 1998 and began playing shows around the area. By 2001, the band had secured its first recording session, a live session at Urbana's WEFT radio station. In 2003, after some major regional success, Kilborn Alley put their first release proper, the eponymous "Kilborn Alley Blues Band" on local label PeeDee Records. The band's version of Johnny "Guitar" Watson's "Too Tired" single found its way to local blues jukeboxes as far north as Chicago. The album and the band's few gigs into some small South and West Side Chicago clubs brought them to the attention of Nick Moss. Prior to the release of the band's first major record, Asselin was nearly killed in a rear-end accident by a semi truck on Interstate 57 outside of Champaign. He went on to make a full recovery and resume playing with Kilborn Alley in 2006.
Moss produced the band's 2006 Blues Music Award-nominated release "Put It in the Alley" on his Blue Bella label. Asselin contributed 12 songwriting credits and harmonica to all the tracks. Asselin was also a part of the band's 2007 BMA-nominated follow-up "Tear Chicago Down", in which he once again contributed songwriting and harmonica efforts. By 2010, Asselin began taking on a lesser role in the band but still appeared as the featured harmonica player on the second-to-last release on Blue Bella for Moss, entitled "Better Off Now". By the end of 2010, Asselin had left the band permanently to pursue full-time a small business in landscaping.
By early 2011, Asselin found himself playing the occasional small acoustic shows around Champaign and Urbana, Illinois. He had long been acquainted with fellow local harmonica player and vocalist Josh Spence. Spence had begun putting together a project that was more of a mixture of blues, rock, and jam band music. Spence's guitarist for the project was moving out of state, and Asselin was asked to join as a guitar player. Asselin joined the band and immediately found success again both locally and regionally. In January 2011, shortly after Asselin joined, the band released their eponymous debut to regional and blues radio fanfare. Mixed by Larry Nix at Ardent Studios, the album was a blend of blues, rock, and rhythm &amp; blues. Asselin contributed songwriting and arrangement credits on all twelve of the album's tracks. The record was placed in the top 20 of the Roots Music Report Contemporary Blues Chart and peaked at number 21 on the "Living Blues" Magazine Radio Charts. The notoriety saw them compete at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee. At the challenge, the band placed in the Top 8 at the finals on the third day of competition, which earned them invitations to play at many blues festivals around the country.
Due to illnesses and scheduling conflicts within the band, Asselin started working solo again after 2013. Local musical relationships again helped Asselin find a home as a guitarist, vocalist and lyricist with a new project with fellow guitarist and vocalist Noah Williams. With some small regional success, Asselin and his new band mates in the William Marsala Blues Band returned to Memphis to compete in the International Blues Challenge in 2016. In 2019, the William Marsala Blues Band released their first album "Stuck In the Blues: Live From Home" on May 17. The album was recorded live at Dark Soul Studios in Decatur, Illinois on December 30, 2018 with no overdubs. The session came about due to the band wanting to shoot a professional promotional video for an upcoming show, and went ahead with recording a full-length list of material in the process.
Asselin, through the help of a GoFundMe campaign, also put together the funds to record his solo self-released acoustic debut "Blue Genes". Asselin has worked with country artist John David Daily and opened for Eric Paslay. Asselin signed with Nashville Entertainment Weekly Records in June 2018. He went on to release the EP "Flat Head Ford" in June 2018 to all platforms. Asselin began performing with Champaign-Urbana, Illinois vocalist/guitarist Lindsay Lilly in March 2019 and will be releasing an album in 2020 under the project called The Black Eyed Lillies. The album is set to be recorded at Blackbird Recording Studios in Nashville in January 2020 and has been funded through a GoFundMe campaign. The Black Eyed Lillies have also been selected by the Illinois Central Blues Club as its solo-duo performance representative at the International Blues Challenge in Memphis, Tennessee on January 28-February 1, 2020.

Medicine Hat explosion

The Medicine Hat explosion occurred on the afternoon of March 19, 1913, when a pocket of gas in the basement of the former Malcolm Canneries building, in Medicine Hat, Alberta ignited and destroyed the building. The resulting explosion killed 5 people and wounded 12 others. Over 100 years later, it remains the largest industrial accident in the city’s history.
Incident.
In early 1913, the Malcolm Canneries building had recently been sold to the Western Canada Cold Storage and Packing company. The new owner was in the process of installing machinery used for meat packing. A watchman noticed a fire around the walls and called the local fire department. In the meantime, spectators began to gather nearby to watch the event.
When the first responders saw where the fire was coming from, they started to chop a hole in the floor of the building to locate the source. A fireman, B. Ringler, was using an axe and had just opened a hole in the floor when he felt a sudden rush of natural gas. Realizing the danger, he yelled to the other firemen to get out of the building. As the men rushed towards the exit, a mighty roar was heard as the building exploded before everyone could get out.
The explosion reportedly raised the roof of the 3-storey building in the air while the brick side walls collapsed. The roof then came crashing back down and buried two people inside. The resulting debris of bricks and timbers was launched into the surrounding area, wounding officials and spectators. In total, five people died, two of them firemen, one a city employee and two spectators including a twelve year-old boy.
Aftermath.
Following the explosion, crews worked to remove the debris to locate the missing. The weather in March made recovery difficult, as the temperature that night dropped to -20 degrees Celsius. The local hospital received the seriously injured as well as those with minor injuries from flying bricks.
An investigation was held and it was determined that the firemen had triggered the explosion when they used an axe to cut into a sewer pipe, where the gas was seeping from. At the time, gas leaks were common and the use of mercaptan to odorize natural gas was not yet established.
Commemoration.
On March 19, 2013, a public ceremony was held at Fire Station No. 3 in Medicine Hat, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the incident. The ceremony was held at the Firefighters Memorial to recognize the loss of life and community impact due to the explosion. A private service for the families of the descendants of the fallen firefighters was also held.

The audience is welcomed to "Issues in Focus," a political news and talk program based out of Washington, and are introduced to the show's host, self-described Washington insider Dick Hedgerow. Dick announces the entirety of the night's program will be devoted to an in-depth discussion on the threat of extremism and welcomes his guest; Norman "Norm" Krieger, a co-founder of the fictitious polling and counterterrorism organization, the Center of Advanced Strategic Studies. Norm has been invited on the show to discuss his newly-published book, "Extremism in the 21st Century", which focuses on the mindset of extremists and their psychological motivations, as well as how they're able to spread their beliefs globally. Norm explains that he believes extremism should be considered the final threat to a democratic world (albeit there are other, manageable threats that are easy to handle), and tells Dick that while the government should be constantly fighting back against this threat, it's important to keep the public placated, and allow them to carry on with their normal lives.
Norm further elaborates that as the threat of extremism is combated, the public's understanding of it will be skewed, and it will ultimately become too difficult to keep up with the narrative, and the majority of the details will be indiscernible. Dick insists that this isn't an issue, suggesting that they refrain from complete transparency with the American people, citing security concerns, and instead try and help them adjust the way they see things, which Norm claims were his motivations for writing his book. As their discussion continues, Dick inquires about a concrete definition of the word "extremism," which Norm initially struggles with; he eventually decides that extremism is primarily defined by violence, or advocating for its use. When Dick asks if this definition transcends political leanings, such as conservative or liberal views, Norm proposes that these labels have lost their meaning beyond the competition aspect, but later contradicts himself when he says it is absolutely necessary for America to maintain the two-party system, as a country with no ideological opposition would be undemocratic.
The interview then shifts gears as it begins to investigate the extremists' intentions, which Norm believes is not only to incite violence but to make people think, asking complicated and dangerous questions that will only lead to insanity. Instead of engaging in the destructive act of thinking, Norm insists that the viewers need to stick to the facts provided by those in power in the government and the media and unquestionably devote their minds to the programming that "freedom-loving people" such as himself are trying to ensure all of society conforms to. When Dick objects to this concept, claiming it is nothing better than the brainwashing that extremists are guilty of, Norm reassures him that this is brainwashing people with the truth, while the other option is to be brainwashed with "made-up extremist nonsense." As the play carries on, Dick and Norm constantly renege on their stances and their beliefs, and at its conclusion, they nearly break the fourth wall, seemingly aware that they are actors in an elaborate performance and are no less extremists than the terrorists they have warned the audience of.
Production History.
"The Extremists" was first produced at the English Theatre Berlin, in February 2009, directed by Walter D. Asmus. It was followed by a production at Seven Stages Theatre, who co-produced the original showing, in Atlanta, Georgia, in March of the same year.
In 2010, a staged reading of the play was performed at the Schauspielhaus Bochum in Bochum, Germany, as well as the Acker Stadt Palast performing arts center in Berlin, 2012. A German translation of the play translated by Jasna Miletic was used for both productions.
Clancy Productions &amp; Assembly produced the play at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe in Edinburgh, Scotland, with David Calvitto in the role of Norman Krieger, and Carol Scudder playing Jane Woolwraith, a female counterpart to the script's Dick Hedgerow.
A 2018 production was performed at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, directed by Raymond Munro, with Jake Rosenthal as Norman Krieger, and Brett Iarrobino as Dick Hedgerow.
Critical Reception.
Critics have praised the play for its complex and intricate text; a review of the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe production describes Hopkins' script as a "fiendishly complex rollercoaster." Critics found the performances of Calvitto and Scudder dazzling, citing an incredible pace, and noting that audiences would leave the show questioning their understanding of western democracy.
Kolja Reichert of the German newspaper "Der Tagesspiegel" called the performance at the English Theatre Berlin "heady theater in the truest sense," and focused on the question of reality: "Hopkins builds a construct of ideas out of rhetoric until everything revolves around one thing - what is the truth for the good guys and what is it for the bad guys?" A review of the production in "Die Tageszeitung" claimed the play was an excellent example of the advantages theater holds over film, in that it lays bare the mechanisms of the media.

The Key (The Walking Dead)

"The Key" is the twelfth episode of the eighth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series "The Walking Dead", which aired on AMC on March 18, 2018. It was written by Corey Reed and Channing Powell, and directed by Greg Nicotero.
Plot.
At the Sanctuary, Negan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) organizes the Saviors to cover their weapons in the blood and viscera of the walkers prior to an attack on the Hilltop community. Dwight (Austin Amelio) struggles with hiding his loyalty to Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his allies from Negan and his other lieutenants, particularly Simon (Steven Ogg) as the Saviors start to convoy towards Hilltop.
Meanwhile, Rick and Michonne (Danai Gurira) return to the Hilltop to regroup. Daryl (Norman Reedus) apologizes to Rick for indirectly enabling the Saviors to clear out Sanctuary, resulting in the attacks on the various communities, while Rick admits that his plan of simply waiting for the Saviors ' surrender was insufficient. The two decide to continue scouting around Hilltop, leaving Maggie (Lauren Cohan) in charge. While waiting, Maggie spots empty crates outside of Hilltop, and on retrieving them, finds a note requesting supplies and vinyl records in exchange for the promise of "the key" to help them. Though Maggie is cautious, she, Michonne, Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Enid (Katelyn Nacon) decide to comply to see who might be willing to help. At the planned meeting point, the four meet Georgie (Jayne Atkinson) with her aides, Hilda (Kim Ormiston) and Midge (Misty Ormiston), who offers them knowledge in exchange for the supplies they were to bring. Maggie decides to hold them at Hilltop until they can figure out what they can do. As Maggie and Michonne discuss what to do, Enid suggests they should just turn Georgie away. Michonne talks her down, and Maggie realizes that the better option would be to fulfill Georgie's wishes. Georgie, in return, offers them some of their food, and a book of plans for constructing rudimentary structures like windmills, hoping that Maggie can turn Hilltop into a thriving community the next time she visits. As Georgie drives off, Enid admits to Michonne she killed the leader of Oceanside, Natanya, and is unsure of how she can know what the right thing is to do.
Outside the walls of the Hilltop, Rick spots the Saviors' convoy, and proceeds to chase them down, ramming Negan's car out of the convoy. Rick chases Negan through a desolate town, eventually tipping his car over. Negan flees into an abandoned building; Rick follows him upstairs with walkers following after them. Rick tries to kill Negan with a hatchet. Negan dives for cover but falls into the building's basement after crashing through some of the rotten wood. Rick follows Negan into the basement, finding his bat "Lucille". As Rick attempts to hunt him down in the dark basement, Negan tries to persuade Rick to surrender by offering to reduce the amount of resources that the Saviors take from the community. Rick rebukes him, refusing to trust him after the Scavengers were wiped out by Saviors; Negan, who had Simon go make "his standard deal" with the Scavengers, realizes that Simon disobeyed him by killing the Scavengers. To lure Negan out, Rick sets fire to Lucille and uses it to bash through a door that he heard walkers behind. The two fight as walkers swarm them; Negan manages to recover Lucille and get away, and Rick escapes soon after but loses track of Negan.
In the midst of events, Simon orders the other Saviors to surround the area while he and Dwight go to find Negan. While looking, Simon talks to Dwight, suggesting that they consider Negan may be dead so they can take control of the Saviors and make the group stronger. They find Negan's upturned car, but instead of searching for Negan, Dwight sets fire to it, and they return to rest of their men. Simon takes control, stating that Negan may be dead, and he now plans to "expunge" the other communities. Elsewhere, Negan wakes up to find that he was taken captive by Jadis (Pollyanna McIntosh), holding him at gunpoint.

Halcyon 6

Halcyon 6: Starbase Commander is an indie strategy video game and turn-based tactical RPG hybrid developed and published by Massive Damage, Inc.. It was released on September 8, 2016 for Windows, OS X and Linux, and October 19, 2017 for iOS. Taking place in a science fiction setting, the player must reclaim and rebuild the derelict ancient space station Halcyon 6 in order to stop an impending alien invasion of Earth.
The game received mixed reviews from critics, praising the game's concept but criticizing its slow progression. This caused the game's developers to release an enhanced version, "Lightspeed Edition", which decreased the game's length significantly, in addition to adding new features.
Gameplay.
The game revolves around managing and building the player's base, which has individual rooms that must be cleared out. To do this the player must gather resources from nearby worlds. They must also deal with attacking enemies such as pirates and aliens entering through portals that must be closed. There are two types of combat, ground and ship-to-ship, both of which operate in the manner of a turn-based RPG. The player can use combos to exploit vulnerabilities and apply status effects.
Development.
"Halcyon 6" was funded on Kickstarter, where its initial budget was USD $40,000. It ended up making almost $200,000 due to coverage from large gaming sites and promotional assistance from Square Enix Collective. The developers emulated the successful marketing campaigns of "Darkest Dungeon" and "Moon Hunters". Its development team was based in Toronto.
The game was inspired by the setting of "Star Trek", and by the gameplay of "Master of Orion", "Jagged Alliance", and "Star Control". Its base-building gameplay also took inspiration from "". Combining the individual systems of different genres was stated to be difficult, with the developers going through "5 or 6" different combat systems. Each aspect of the game was assigned to a different developer.
In 2017, the game's developers released "Halcyon 6: Lightspeed Edition", which fixed aspects that were criticized about the original game. This included a sped-up and "streamlined" campaign, slightly increased difficulty and improved combat and UI. It was released for free as a separate game to owners of the original.
Reception.
"Halcyon 6" received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 71/100 on Metacritic.
Adam Smith of "Rock, Paper, Shotgun" called the game enjoyable, but "less than the sum of its parts", saying that its mixture of gameplay genres "don't quite fit" with each other. He described the game's aliens as "dangerous [...] but also kind of adorable", saying that ""Halcyon" makes cosmic horror cute". Jason Bohn of "Hardcore Gamer" rated the game 4/5, calling it "one of those titles that cannot be recommended enough to fans of 4X games, JRPGs or space-based science fiction", despite "a few small details holding it back". Kat Bailey of "USgamer" rated the game 60/100, calling it "flawed but promising", praising the game's overall concept and calling its soundtrack "phenomenal", but criticizing its "tedious resource gathering, repetitive combat, and bugs".

Economic history of Azerbaijan

The economic history of Azerbaijan is a historical review of the development of the Azerbaijani economy from the beginning of the 20th century to the modern economy of the Republic of Azerbaijan.
The economy of Azerbaijan in the period of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic.
The government of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan did a lot of work from 1918 to 1920 to restore the Azerbaijani economy, which faced a decline following the overthrow of tsarism.
In 1919 the State Budget of Azerbaijan amounted to 665 million manats. The bulk of it was replenished by selling oil and levying profit tax, which was 30% then. Other sources of fiscal revenues were excise taxes on the sale of wine, tobacco and oil.
The custom services, established in those years, contributed 100 million manats to the treasury. 15 million manats came from duties levied on free trade, freight and passenger transportation. In those years Azerbaijan was a more agrarian country, aimed mainly at animal husbandry. During this period the cattle reached 1 million heads, horses – 150 thousand heads, buffaloes – 300 thousand heads, camels – 12 thousand head, rams and goats 1.5 million heads. Bartering was common in trade and economic relations of the Republic: oil was given in exchange for imported goods.
Azerbaijan was paying for military goods, telephone sets, cars, 100 locomotives, 2 thousand tanks, 5 thousand closed wagons, food products of America, France, Italy and other countries mainly with oil, cotton, wool, silk and leather.
The export of Azerbaijani oil declined significantly following the revolution in Russia. Because of the closure of the northern market in 1919 only 600 thousand tons of oil were exported from the 3.6 million tons of oil produced. Exporting oil to Europe became possible only after the restoration of the Baku-Batumi oil pipeline in 1919 and construction of the Baku-Julfa railway.
In the years 1918-1920 the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan made some changes in the administrative-territorial structure of the country and reorganized financial affairs of the country.
Within the Soviet Union.
The shaping of economic structure of the country continued at a slow pace during 1920-1939. The primary economic sectors were oil, gas, chemical, light industries, food processing, machine building and metalworking.
In the first years after the Second World War, all the branches of the economy were adjusted to the requirements of the peacetime period. In 1948, the republic's industry produced more goods than in the prewar years. In 1950, the production of industrial goods increased by 39% compared to 1940. In the 1950s and 1960s, the development of Azerbaijan industry was intensified, regional and sectoral structures had been improved. The output of industrial goods increased by 5.5 times in comparison with 1940. 146 large industrial facilities, which amounted to 60% of all constructions, were built and put into production in the years between 1941 and 1970s. Major factories such as the plant for the production of pipes, aluminum and rubber synthesis in Sumqayit, the Ganja aluminum smelter, the Dashkesen ore purification plant, the Mingechaur hydroelectric power station, etc., were built and put into production for the Azerbaijani industry. Thereby the foundation was laid for the development of such industries as heavy industry, energy, chemistry, petrochemistry, oil refining, ferrous and non-ferrous metallurgy, instrument making and electrical engineering.
During these years, a lot of work was done in the direction of profitable placement of industrial sectors and facilities in the country, developing of the regions with a low standard of living, increasing the level of use of labor resources in small and medium-sized cities.
Years of Independence.
Since the country's independence in 1991, the Republic of Azerbaijan has embarked on an independent policy in the field of economy. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Azerbaijan's economy had been severely damaged. The poverty rate had reached 49% in 2001. Later Azerbaijan's gross national income (GNI) amounted to $7,350 (2013) per capita, GDP per capita to $7,912.5 (2013), and a poverty rate decreased to 5% in 2013.
The exploitation of hydrocarbon resources has played a pivotal role in the economic development of Azerbaijan. The number of agreements with foreign companies and foreign investments had also contributed to the state's economy. Transition to market economy by adopting relevant reforms had also been one of the main objectives of the economic policy.
The first period of the economical development of Azerbaijan (from 1991-1995) can be described as the period of economic recession. The period after 1996 can be portrayed as the period of dynamic economic development.
Azerbaijan had broad-based economic foundations, which had been developing in different directions before 1991. Independence led to economic decline in Azerbaijan. Many factors caused GDP shrinking until 1996. The situation with Armenia aggravated the economic downturn.
In 1994, one of the important oil contracts was signed between Azerbaijan and 13 major oil companies, representing 8 countries of the world. This agreement went down in history as "the Contract of Century".
In the same year, the Presidents of the United States, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan signed inter-State agreement on the construction of oil export pipeline Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan.
A contract was signed in Baku between BP, Statoil, LUKAgip, Elf Aquitaine (France) (now TOTAL), OIEC (Iran) (now NICO), TPAO and SOCAR on the promising structure of Shah Deniz gas condensate field in 1996.
In 1999, the Baku-Supsa oil pipeline was put into operation. The pipeline was built as part of the contract for the development of the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli fields.Oil-gas sector contributed to the flourishing of other fields of economy. New reforms and measures were taken to reach macroeconomic and financial stability. During those years, Azerbaijan had joined different international institutions (IMF, World Bank, EBRD, Islam Development Bank, Asian Development Bank). The poverty rate had been decreased from 68% in 1995 to 29% in 2005 due to the economic growth.
In 2005, the government decided to revalue the manat at the rate of 5,000 to 1 new manat (AZN). In 2005–2010 years average annual growth rates of "oil" GDP more than 3.5 times higher than the increase in "non-oil" GDP. The share of the oil sector in the country's GDP for this period rose from 39 to 60%. Bank loans and incentive measures of the government contributed to the rapid growth of non-oil industries. Significant growth in the construction industry and service sector led to the fact that in 2010, the non-oil sector of Azerbaijan's economy overtook the oil industry in terms of growth rates.
3 five-year programs related to the socio-economic development of the Republic of Azerbaijan were implemented during 2004-2013. These programs were aimed at economic diversification. "State Programs for Social and Economic Development for 2014-2018", "State Programs on Poverty Reduction and Sustainable Development in the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2008-2015", "State Programs for reliable food supply of the population of the Republic of Azerbaijan for 2008-2015" and a number of sectoral development programs were implemented to date.
A number of socioeconomic region development programs aimed at economic diversification were implemented between 2004 and 2018.
The estimates of the Davos World Economic Forum showed that Azerbaijan's economy ranked 38th in the world for the level of competitiveness.

Raghunatha agrees to marry her after he returns. Raghunatha's mother also dies on tour. Finally, Raghunatha reaches Puri Jagannadh, where he meets Swamy Chidananda (Chittor V. Nagaiah) and he also comes in touch with Rangadasu, a cheat in a Sages form who heckles him. Raghunatha wants to commit suicide but is rescued by divine Lord Krishna (N. T. Rama Rao), and people start liking him. Rangadasu engages people to kill him, Chidananda Swamy rescues him, takes him to his "Ashram" and teaches him to practice yoga.
Meanwhile, Annapurna's mother Kameswari fixes another alliance to her. Raghunatha comes to know about this and he reaches his hometown. Kameswari poisons Raghunatha, but nothing happens to him. At midnight he was taken away by unknown people, but Swamy Chidananda arrives, protects him and also performs the marriage of Raghunatha and Annapurna. After the marriage, the couple reaches Puri and start living in the "Ashram". Rangadasu is envious about his popularity, hence he makes people doubt his devotion. One evening many people visit Raghunatha's Ashram, so, Annapurna sells her jewelry to feed them. Due to heavy rain, all shops are closed. Only one person on the way stops her and says that he will arrange the food if she agrees to fulfill his lust. Now Annapurna is in a dilemma and says that her God will fulfill his good wish. After the guests are honored in an appropriate manner, the person comes to the "Ashram" and calls her. Annapurna introduces him to Raghunatha and tells him about her promise.

History.
The name "Pratu Phi" means "ghost's gate", because the area used to be the location of the city gate used to transport dead bodies out of the fortified city for cremation during the early Rattanakosin period. Cremations were usually held at the nearby Wat Saket, just across the city moat of Khlong Rop Krung. The area was later officially named "Samran Rat" ("happiness citizen") for auspiciousness. But the name Pratu Phi remains in use by many people.
In modern times, Samran Rat is known as the hub of notable restaurants, serving a variety of Thai and street food such as pad thai and yen ta fo, with multiple traditional cafés (kopitiam) located in the area. The neighbourhood's better known restaurants include Jay Fai, which received one Michelin Guide star in 2017, and Thipsamai, which specializes in pad thai.

Grace Foster Herben

Grace Ida Foster Herben (born Grace Ida Foster, 19 September 1864 – 23 July 1938) was an American educator and missionary. The daughter of a minister and the wife of another, her career became intertwined with that of Rev. Stephen J. Herben after their marriage. Beforehand she served as the dean of women at Allegheny College, and afterwards she worked with the Northwestern Branch of the Methodist Woman's Foreign Missionary Society. She was a delegate to the 1910 World Missionary Conference, and was the only woman to serve on the New Jersey Council of National Defense during World War I.
Early life and education.
Herben was born Grace Ida Foster on 19 September 1864, in Lanark, Illinois. Her father was Rev. John Onesimus Foster, a member of the Rock River Conference and chaplain of the Sons of the American Revolution, and her mother Caroline Amelia Foster (née Bolles). Foster received voice lessons growing up, singing to audiences on occasion, and eventually training others; in 1887, she put on a concert with 45 singers, trained by her, in order to help fund her education. She performed again the following year, at a reunion of the Christian Commission in Round Lake, New York, which she attended with her father. In 1889 she graduated from Northwestern University with a Bachelor of Letters.
Career.
Around August 1889, Herben was appointed dean of women at Allegheny College, beginning her duties of 17 September. Herben came recommended by Bishop John H. Vincent, also taught history at the school, and served until 1891. While working in Pennsylvania, she still spent some time in Chicago. Her 1891 marriage to Rev. Stephen J. Herben largely merged her career with his, with both devoted to the ministry, although from 1891 to 1892 she was also a graduate student at Northwestern.
Herben was involved in the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church since at least 1903. In 1906, she started a college department of the Northwestern Branch of the organization, and served as secretary from 1906 to 1910. The program flourished, and was copied by most major denominations. This engineered a further program to attract female college students to missionary work.
Herben was a delegate to the 1910 World Missionary Conference. During World War I she was the only woman to serve on the New Jersey Council of National Defense, and was the chairman of the publicity department of the Women's Council for National Defense. She also chaired both the YWCA, and a committee related to food production, distribution, and conservation, and was a member of the Literary and Social Circle of the First Methodist church; in 1918, Mayor H. W. Evans appointed her to represent the town's Community Market at the meeting of the State Board Markets. Shortly after victory was declared in the war, Herben urged that saloons be closed and alcohol sales prohibited on the days of celebration. The following year she traveled to Houston for the annual conference of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, delivering a speech on "Waging Peace".
Personal life.
Herben married Stephen J. Herben, a Northwestern classmate, on 27 May 1891. They had two children: George Foster Herben, a physician, and Stephen Joseph Herben Jr., a philologist at Bryn Mawr College. Her husband died in February 1937; a resident of Maplewood, New Jersey, she died in July of the following year, in Orange, New Jersey.
In 1906 Herben was accidentally shot by George Foster Herben while target shooting. The bullet lodged above her left knee and was not deemed serious, although her husband's initial refusal to answer questions about the matter led to sensational headlines, such as "Lips are Sealed: Rev. Herben's Wife Shot Down".

Arnoglossus imperialis

Arnoglossus imperialis, the imperial scaldfish, is a species of flatfish from the family of left-eyed flounders, the Bothidae. It occurs in the eastern Atlantic from Scotland south to Namibia, extending into the western Mediterranean. This bottom dwelling species is sometimes caught as bycatch but is of little interest to fisheries.
Description.
Arnoglossus imperialis is a flatfish which has a short snout, shorter than diameter of eye. The eyes are separated by a bony ridge with the lower eye slightly in front of the upper eye. It has 95-106 rays in its dorsal fin and 74-82 in its anal fin, the males have the second to sixth dorsal fin rays elongated and thickened, in the females and it is the second to fifth. The lateral line has 51-66 scales and curves above the pectoral fin. The eyed side is greyish or brownish in colour with dark, irregular blotches; there are some small spots or blotches on the fins and in males there is a distinct black spot on posterior part of pelvic fins; in females, this spot paler and often quite indistinct. They grow to around to about 25 cm standard length.
Distribution.
"Arnoglossus imperialis" ranges along much of the eastern Atlantic from Scotland south to Nambia, including the Azores. This species is also found in the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.
Habitat and biology.
"Arnoglossus imperialis" is found on sandy or muddy bottoms down to a depth of 350m, it can also be found on substrates made of shell or coral The major part of its diet is polychaete worms, although benthic crustaceans are probably also important. Off the coast of Portugal crustaceans of the order Mysidacea were the most important food item preyed on by "A imperialis" while an earlier study off northern France had found gish to be an important food, especially "Callionymus lyra".

Fish v. Kobach

Fish v. Kobach (officially known since 2019-01-19 as Fish v. Schwab) was a bench trial in United States District Court for the District of Kansas in which five Kansas residents and the League of Women Voters contested the legality of the Documentary Proof of Citizenship (DPOC) requirement of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act, enacted in 2011, which took effect in 2013.
Then-Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach claimed these procedures were needed to protect the nation from a supposedly massive problem of vote fraud by people not legally allowed to do so, including 11.3 percent of non-citizens residing in the US amounting to some 3.2 million votes in 2016, greater than Hillary Clinton's lead in the 2016 popular vote. The plaintiffs in this case claimed there was essentially no evidence to support Kobach's allegations.
Trial hearings ran from March 6 to 19, 2018, with a contempt hearing for Kobach on March 20 with Chief District Judge Julie A. Robinson presiding. Robinson was appointed to the District court by President George W. Bush in 2001. On May 18 Judge Robinson ruled Kobach in contempt.
Final rulings were issued June 18 and 19, 2018. In brief, Judge Robinson found that the defense had presented no credible evidence of the massive problem claimed and instead had erected substantial obstacles to voter registration by people eligible to vote per the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She further found defendant Kobach in contempt of court.
Trial by ambush.
During the first three days of the trial, Robinson repeatedly warned Kobach about trying to introduce evidence that had not been shared with the plaintiffs during discovery. Kobach complained that the discussions "are relying on numbers that are stale". After three days, Robinson said, “We're not going to have a trial by ambush here... You're stuck with what you provided to [the plaintiffs] by the deadline".
Kobach contempt hearing.
Secretary Kobach had been fined $1,000 in 2017 for violating previous court orders in this case. In the March 20, 2018, contempt hearing Judge Julie Robinson was visibly agitated when it was revealed that he had still not complied with her 2016 court orders in two specific ways:
In the March 2018 hearings, Kobach claimed he had given verbal instructions to that effect but acknowledged that some county election offices may not have complied with this ruling. Robinson said that Kobach had assured her in telephone hearings that he had instructed his office to order county election officials to mail the postcards to all voters covered by her order. Kobach claimed she had not put that requirement in writing. She replied, “Why would I order something in writing that you've told me is being taken care of? ... (As an officer of the court) you are under an ethical obligation to tell me the truth.'”
On April 18, 2018, Judge Robinson ruled Kobach in contempt. She did not fine him but did order him to pay court costs, including attorney fees for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the contempt ruling. Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Kobach's campaign for governor, said the secretary of state's office would appeal the decision and would have no other comment. (Governor Jeff Coyler, who lost to Kobach in the 2018 Republican primary for Governor, said Kobach should be required to personally pay those fees that had been awarded. Secretary Kobach's office said that Kobach is shielded from any such liability.)
Findings of fact and conclusions of law.
On June 18 and 19, 2018, Judge Robinson published 118 pages of “Findings of fact and conclusions of law” in this case. In broad strokes, she sided with the plaintiffs on most of the major points in question and with the defense on a few relatively minor points.
Substantive rulings.
Most importantly, “the Court finds in favor of the Plaintiffs in the "Fish" case,” establishing that the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the “motor voter” act) takes precedence over the Kansas DPOC requirements. In addition, the “Court further finds in favor of Plaintiff Bednasek in his constitutional challenge”, concluding that the DPOC violated the 
fourteenth amendment. ("Bednasek v. Kobach" started as a separate case that was later joined to "Fish v. Kobach", because of the similarities of the issues involved.)
“Further, the Court imposes specific compliance measures given the Defendant's history of non-compliance with this Court's orders. And the Court imposes sanctions responsive to Defendant's repeated and flagrant violations of discovery and disclosure rules.” In particular, “Defendant shall strictly comply with the directives in this Order meant to enforce the Court's permanent injunction of the DPOC law and K.A.R. sec. 7-23-15. It is further ordered that Defendant shall attend 6 hours [of continuing legal education (CLE) on civil rules of procedure or evidence] in addition to any other CLE education required by his law license for the 2018-2019 reporting year.”
Lesser findings and rulings.
Defendant Nick Jordan, Kansas Secretary of Revenue, was dismissed from the case.
Mr. Fish's complaint was declared moot, because “in September or October 2016, he relocated within Douglas County and changed his address with the DOV in person. ... He is now registered to vote ... not due to the Court’s preliminary injunction, but his voluntary action of reapplying to register to vote at which time he provided DPOC."
Judge Robinson further generally found the plaintiff's expert witnesses credible while expert witnesses for the defense were often found to be not credible. For example, “Defendant's expert Hans von Spakovsky is a senior legal fellow at The Heritage Foundation, 'a think tank whose mission [is to] formulate and promote conservative public policies. ... [He] cited a U.S. GAO study for the proposition that the GAO 'found that up to 3 percent of the 30,000 individuals called for jury duty from voter registration roles over a two-year period in just one U.S. district court were not U.S. citizens.' On cross-examination, however, he acknowledged that he omitted the following facts: the GAO study contained information on a total of 8 district courts; 4 of the 8 reported that there was not a single non-citizen who had been called for jury duty; and the 3 remaining district courts reported that less than 1% of those called for jury duty from voter rolls were noncitizens. Therefore, his report misleadingly described the only district court with the highest percentage of people reporting that they were noncitizens, while omitting mention of the 7 other courts described in the GAO report, including 4 that had no incidents of noncitizens on the rolls. ... While [Mr. von Spakovsky's] lack of academic background is not fatal to his credibility ..., his clear agenda and misleading statements ... render his opinions unpersuasive. In contrast, Plaintiffs offered Dr. Lorraine Minnite, an objective expert witness, who provided compelling testimony about Defendant's claims of noncitizen registration. Dr. Minnite ... has extensively researched and studied the incidence and effect of voter fraud in American elections. Her published research on the topic spans over a decade and includes her full-length, peer reviewed book, "The Myth of Voter Fraud", for which Dr. Minnite has received grants and professional distinctions, and numerous articles and chapters in edited volumes. ... Notably, Dr. Minnite testified that when she began researching the issue of voter fraud, ..., she began with a 'blank slate' about the conclusions she would ultimately draw from the research. ... Although she admits that noncitizen registration and voting does at times occur, Dr. Minnite testified that there is no empirical evidence to support Defendant's claims in this case that noncitizen registration and voting in Kansas are largescale problems. ... [M]any of these cases reflect isolated incidents of avoidable administrative errors ... and / or misunderstanding on the part of applicants. ... For example, 100 individuals in ELVIS [the Kansas Election Voter Information System] have birth dates in the 1800s, indicating that they are older than 118. And 400 individuals have birth dates after their date of registration, indicating they registered to vote before they were born."
Magnitude of the problems.
"The voting rate among purported noncitizen registrations on [a Kansas temporary drivers license] match list is around 1%, whereas the voting rate among registrants in Kansas more generally is around 70%.” 
Beyond noting that only about 1% of registrants purported to be noncitizens actually voted, the court found that "31,089 total applicants ... were denied registration for failure to provide DPOC, ... [which] represented 12.4% of new voter registrations between January 1, 2013 and December 11, 2015", the cutoff date for confidential ELVIS data provided to plaintiff's expert witness, Dr. Michael McDonald, an Associate Professor of Political Science at the University of Florida and a leading scholar on American elections, voter registration, and factors affecting voter behavior and turnout. 
By comparison, "Defendant already has prosecutorial authority over Kansas election crimes. Yet, since obtaining this authority, and despite claiming to have located 129 instances of noncitizen registration in Kansas, Defendant has filed zero criminal complaints against noncitizens for registering to vote." But "looking closely at those [129] records reduces that number to 67 at most. Even these 67 instances are a liberal estimate because it includes attempted registrations after the DPOC law was passed, a larger universe than what the Tenth Circuit asked the Court to evaluate. Only 39 successfully registered to vote. ... And several of the individual records of those who registered or attempted to register show errors on the part of State employees, and/or confusion on the part of applicants." Moreover, those 39 represent only "0.002% of all registered voters in Kansas as of January 1, 2013 (1,762,330). Defendant Kobach “insists that [published numbers of noncitizens voting] are just 'the tip of the iceberg.' This trial was his opportunity to produce credible evidence of that iceberg, but he failed to do so. ... Instead, the Court draws the more obvious conclusion that there is no iceberg; only an icicle, largely created by confusion and administrative error.”
Summary of impact on democracy in Kansas.
The court found that "31,089 total applicants ... were denied registration for failure to provide DPOC, ... [which] represented 12.4% of new voter registrations between January 1, 2013 and December 11, 2015". Meanwhile, Kansas Secretary of State Kobach, who claimed this was a massive problem, provided evidence of only 39 cases of non-citizens having registered to vote in Kansas, which represented only "0.002% of all registered voters".

Glorieta Park

Glorieta Park, sometimes spelled Glorietta Park, is an urban park in Caloocan, northern Metro Manila, the Philippines. It is situated at the border between the villages of Barangay 187 and Barangay 188 (Zone 16, District I) in the former Tala Estate in North Caloocan close to the boundary with San Jose del Monte, Bulacan. The park is one of three city-owned parks in Caloocan under the management of the Caloocan Parks Administration Services, the others being the Buena Park and Sports Complex in South Caloocan and the Caloocan Amparo Nature Park in eastern Tala, North Caloocan.
The park occupies the central section of the former friar estate known as "Hacienda Tala" in the old municipality of Novaliches. This estate was purchased by the Philippine Commonwealth government under President Manuel Luis Quezon in 1938 for use as a leper colony to decongest and eventually replace the San Lazaro Hospital for Hansenites in Manila. The Central Luzon Leprosarium, built in 1940, was eventually reduced to an area of in 1971 through Proclamation No. 843 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos which set aside for the National Housing Authority (Philippines), for the Caloocan local government for use as a civic center containing its city hall, public high school, stadia and park to be located at its geographic center, for the Department of Social Welfare and Development bordering the planned civic center, and the remaining for housing and resettlement sites to be administered by the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation.
Glorieta Park is at the junction of Uyguanco Avenue and Langit Road and is the largest open space and recreation area in Barangay 187. It features a children's playground and the
Glorieta Multi-Purpose Gymnasium, a covered court formerly known as the Glorieta Kiosk. The Our Lady of Holy Rosary Parish Church borders the park to the north. It is also the location of the Tala Health Center, the Tala Post Office, the Tala United Methodist Church and Holy Rosary College. The barangay hall of Barangay 187 lies immediately to the east on Uyguanco Avenue. It is accessible from the Caloocan districts of Camarin and Bagong Silang on the south and west via the Zabarte/Old Zabarte Road and Langit Road, and from Novaliches, Greater Lagro and Fairview on the east and southeast via Quirino Highway and Uyguanco Avenue.
In February 2012, as part of the city's 50th anniversary, the Caloocan city government under Mayor Enrico Echiverri hosted a mass wedding at the Glorieta Park wherein a total of 1,510 couples were wed in an attempt to beat India's Guinness record for holding the world's largest mass wedding.
In October 2015, Mayor Oscar Malapitan formally inaugurated the Glorieta Amphitheater within the park which has a seating capacity of 1,500 and which will serveas a venue to showcase the talents and skills of Caloocanians. The amphiteater, which cost to build, was approved in the 2014 Caloocan City Supplemental Budget No. 14 under its "Sangguniang Panlungsod" Ordinance No. 0541.
Under the Caloocan City Comprehensive Development Plan 2017–2019, the Caloocan local government plans to construct additional sports facilities within the park, as well as a lagoon and fountain at the left and right side of the covered court, and a perimeter fence with lamp posts. The plan also includes the installation of a permanent front and back door access to the park for VIP use.

Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee

Temporary Advisory and Scientific Committee (, TKDN) was established in 1933 under the patronage of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Poland. It was one of the first attempts in pre-Second World War Poland to institutionalise the army’s cooperation with the scientific community in order to increase the country's military and economic potential. The following eminent scientists participated in the work of the TKDN: Janusz Groszkowski, Maksymilian Huber, Stanisław Pawłowski, Mieczysław Pożaryski, Antoni Roman, Bohdan Stefanowski, Wojciech Świętosławski, Czesław Witoszyński, Mieczysław Wolfke and in 1936 Kazimierz Smoleński. The liaison officers of the Ministry of Military Affairs included: Col. Zagrodzki, MD, Col. Stanisław Witkowski, Dipl.Eng, (Head of the War Industry Bureau), and Lt. Col. Leopold Gebel, (Deputy Head of the Army Administration Office, secretary to the TKDN).
An increasingly turbulent situation in Europe necessitated the development of new weapons and equipment for the army. The scope of TKDN's work was very broad, ranging from upgrading existing weapons to experimental technologies (e.g. the electric rifle)
The TKDN existed until the late 1930s.

Piano Interpretation

Interplay, is a solo album by jazz pianist Al Haig recorded in 1976 and released on the short-lived Sea Breeze label.
Reception.
The Allmusic review by Ron Wynn states, "A fine solo piano set from 1976, with Al Haig displaying the total technical package on standards and bop anthems. He plays some rapid-fire; others, he constructs slowly and carefully, then tears them down and rebuilds the theme with nicely executed, intricate solos".

Turkish-German University

Turkish-German University (, ) is a state university located in Istanbul, Turkey. The university was founded in 2013 with the intent of having an institute merging academic traditions from both Germany and Turkey. The university offers courses in Turkish, English and German.
The costs for the university are shared by Germany and Turkey. Turkey is taking care of the costs of the buildings. From 2009-2020 around 28 Million Euro were invested from Germany by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research.
In 2016, six academics were dismissed, including two faulty deans. As a reaction to the critique stated by academics from Germany, the rector Halil Akkanat stated that academics from Germany only wanted to talk Turkey down.
Turkish and German education programs have been developed by distinguished Turkish and German scientists. The Turkish-German University Consortium supported this process as a partner. Programs curriculum designed according to the needs of the Turkish and German business sector. The education system of all departments at the university is coordinated by their own partner universities in Germany. The most successful students can get the diplomas of both universities by getting 1 year of education in Germany. For example, all engineering departments except computer engineering are coordinated by Technical University of Berlin. 37 German universities and German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) are members of the consortium. The interstate treaty accepts the Consortium as a German partner of TGU, a state university. Both parties act together for the quality and success of joint research and education. Consortium Board of Directors, consisting of people from the fields of science, politics, culture and economy, supports TGU in its development.
Consortium Members:
In February 2021 it came out that the academic Taceddin Kutay, which has a contract with the university, had continuously published racist and homophobic tweets. Students of the university protested against it.
On the 7th of May 2021 the university social media accounts published a statement that the university has filed a lawsuit against its own member Prof. Dr. Murat Erdoğan considering him to have insulted the president. Students of the university protested against this decision.

Khama Rhino Sanctuary

Khama Rhino Sanctuary is a community based wildlife project in Botswana. The animal shelter was established in 1992 to assist in saving the vanishing rhinoceros, restore the historic wildlife populations and provide economic benefits to the local Botswana community through tourism and the sustainable use of natural resources. Covering approximately 8585 hectares of Kalahari Sandveld, the sanctuary provides prime habitat for white and black rhinos as well as over 30 other animal species and more than 230 species of birds.
History.
In 1989 a group of Serowe residents conceived the idea of a wildlife reserve near Serowe. Serwe Pan, then a cattle post, had been a traditional hunting area teeming with wildlife. The residents wished to re-establish it to its earlier state. In 1993 the Ngwato Land Board allocated the land around Serwe Pan to the Khama Rhino Sanctuary Trust.
Fauna.
Mammals.
The Sanctuary is home to other wildlife which have settled naturally or been translocated in. This includes zebra, blue wildebeest, giraffe, eland, springbok, impala, gemsbok, kudu, steenbok, duiker, red hartebeest, leopard, ostrich, African wild cat, caracal, small spotted genet, black-backed jackal, bat-eared fox, brown hyena.
Birds.
Over 230 bird species have been identified at the sanctuary. Including Abdim's stork and the bearded woodpecker.
Conservation.
The main conservation project undertaken by Khama Rhino Sanctuary is the rhino breeding program. To date, the sanctuary has relocated 16 rhinos to different places within the country from a founder population of four animals. The long term goal of the Sanctuary is to let the rhinos safely breed within its borders and re-introduce them into their natural wild habitats. The rhinos within the sanctuary are secured by anti-poaching patrols carried out by the rangers and the Botswana Defense Force.

George Foster Herben

George Foster Herben (17 March 1893 – 17 March 1966) was an American physician. He spent his career in New York, predominantly treating tuberculosis. After interning at Brooklyn Hospital, Herben worked at the Loomis Sanitarium by Liberty, and then at the House of Rest at Sprain Ridge, a tuberculosis hospital and preventorium in Yonkers. At the House of Rest he variously served as physician in chief and as medical director. Herben developed and published several new treatments during this time, including a replacement for conventional iron lungs.
Herben was the son of Stephen J. Herben and Grace Foster Herben, a Methodist minister and missionary, respectively. His father's influence occasioned a number of high-profile acquaintances, from meeting President Theodore Roosevelt as a boy to knowing his father's friend Thomas Edison. He was the older brother of Stephen J. Herben Jr., a professor of philology at Bryn Mawr College.
Early life and education.
George Foster Herben, who went by Foster, was born on March 17, 1893. His father was Stephen J. Herben, a minister and editor, and a close friend of Thomas Edison who conducted the service at his burial in 1931. George Herben's mother was Grace Foster Herben, an educator and missionary. He was the older of two children; Stephen J. Herben Jr., who became a philologist at Bryn Mawr College, was born four years later. They were the great-great-great-grandsons of Henry Batton, a sergeant in the American Revolutionary War, a fact that occasioned George Herben's later membership in the Sons of the American Revolution.
In 1902, on a visit to Washington, D.C., with his father, Herben met President Theodore Roosevelt and assorted politicians; he published an account of the trip, titled "How I Saw the President", in "The Epworth Herald". Four years later, when Herben was thirteen, his mother was accidentally shot—by Herben according to some reports—in circumstances that newspapers initially termed mysterious, and police suspicious. The two had left to go target shooting along with Stephen J. Herben Jr. on the lake shore just north of Evanston, Illinois, when George, whose rifle had become jammed, handed it to his mother for inspection; in the process the gun fired, lodging a bullet about Grace Herben's left knee. Front-page headlines initially suggested that at the hospital the staff refused to admit the police for several hours until threatened with arrest, that Herben herself refused to discuss the shooting with them, and that her husband had "assumed a hostile attitude" with the chief. "I don't intend to make any of the facts known", Herben Sr. said. A day after slamming his front door in the faces of reporters, he explained the affair to the Chicago newspapers, and stated that his wife was "getting along nicely, and will be out [of the hospital] in a few days, I hope."
Like both his father and brother, George Herben attended Evanston Academy in Illinois, graduating in 1911; while there he penned the words for a school fight song, with an extra chorus aimed specifically at their "'honorable opponents'", Evanston Township High School. After some three years at Wesleyan University, Herben, like his brother, matriculated at Rutgers University. There he was on the swim team, and an associate editor of "The Targum". He graduated in June 1916 with a Bachelor of Science; in the yearbook's so-called "Roll of Honor", he was teased as "The ones with distinguished friends—Foster Herben, 'Me and Edison.'" During World War I, Herben enlisted in the United States Army Medical Corps, and was part of the Cornell University Medical School Unit of the Student Army Training Corps. He served in the states, enlisting on 8 January 1918, and receiving an honorable discharge on 7 December of the same year. On 9 June 1921, he graduated from the Cornell University Medical College in New York City with a Doctor of Medicine.
Career.
Following a short vacation in the Adirondacks, where his family had a cottage at Big Moose Lake, Herben began his career in 1921 as an intern at the Brooklyn Hospital. In June 1927 Herben began work at the Loomis Sanitorium, by Liberty, New York. He worked there until at least 1934, during which time he served as the president of the Medical Society of the County of Sullivan. Herben later worked for many years at the House of Rest at Sprain Ridge, a church-affiliated tuberculosis hospital and preventorium in Yonkers, New York. At various times he worked there as the physician in chief, and as the medical director. In 1947, he was nominated to the Board of Managers of the Yonkers Bureau of Laboratories.
Herben spoke at conferences, including the Tuberculosis Sanatorium Conference of Metropolitan New York, and helped develop several new treatments for tuberculosis. One such treatment, displayed at the annual meeting of the National Tuberculosis Association in 1948, and published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 1949, was designed to replace conventional iron lungs by placing patients in a pressurized chamber which forced air into, and out of, a patient, without the use of their lungs.
George Herben was a member of the American Medical Association, American College of Physicians, and the American College of Chest Physicians. He was reappointed a vice president of the latter—then known as the Federation of American Sanatoria—in 1936. Herben served as the Governor for the organization's New York chapter as of 1945, when he presented it with a plan for postgraduate medical education for physicians leaving the armed services after World War II. In 1946, he was made a Life Member of the American College of Physicians, having previously been a Fellow.
Personal life.
Herben married Beatrice Slayton, also a doctor who worked at a sanitarium, on 20 June 1918. The ceremony was at her family's Twitchell Lake summer house, with his father officiating. They had two children, Muriel Lewis and Foster Herben. George Herben had a long-time interest in radio, and studied photography at one point; in 1943 "The American Annual of Photography" published his photograph "Silver Patriach". He died of a heart attack on 17 March 1966, his 73rd birthday.

Andria Zafirakou

Andria Zafirakou is the 2018 Global Teacher Prize winner. She is an Arts and Textiles teacher at Alperton Community School in northwest London, England .
Career.
Ms Zafirakou was born in north-west London to Greek-Cypriot parents and state-educated in Brent and Camden. She has worked her entire teaching career of 12 years at Alperton Community School and was promoted to Deputy Head of Art within a year of her arrival. She is now Associate Deputy Headteacher leading on staff professional development. She is married to a fitness instructor and has two daughters.
The school.
Alperton Community School is a coeducational secondary school situated in the northwest of London with a student intake that reflects a variety of backgrounds. There are about 130 languages spoken in the London Borough of Brent and Ms Zafirakou has taught herself the basic phrases used by children in about 35 of them - including Hindi, Gujarati and Tamil - in an effort to build links with her pupils and their families. [1]
“By getting pupils to open up about their home lives, I discovered that many of my students come from crowded homes where multiple families share a single property.” Ms Zafirakou said.“It’s often so crowded and noisy I’ve had students tell me they have to do their homework in the bathroom, just to grab a few moments alone so they can concentrate.”“What is amazing is that whatever issues they are having at home, whatever is missing from their life or causing them pain, our school is theirs.” 
Zafirakou organised extra lessons during the day and the weekend, including giving pupils a quiet place to work.
Teaching philosophies.
“(Teaching) it’s all about building relationships. Instead of worrying about teaching the curriculum or making sure that you’ve got a strict classroom environment, build your relationships first. Get your kids on board, connect with them, find out what it is that they’re interested in. Build the relationship, build that trust. And then everything else can happen.” When a child comes into a big frightening secondary school and the teacher greets them in their own language the child is won over, and the parents are won over too and will come into school when requested.
Ms Zafirakou started with art, seeing it as a language-free method of communication. She would introduce children to the art of their own culture before relating it to the white western art movements prescribed in the National Curriculum. She was aware about the levels of deprivation suffered by her pupils, with multiple families living in one house running a rota on when they may use the kitchen or bathroom. She created space for children to work after school and introduced classes on wellbeing and yoga. The curriculum was altered to make many subjects more applied rather than theoretical.

Hochficht

The Hochficht () is a mountain in the Mühlviertel in Upper Austria with a height of . Its summit marks the border between Austria and the Czech Republic. At the top is a rock outcrop with a summit cross, a ski lift station and a weather station. The Czech side of the mountain is in the core zone of the Bohemian Forest National Park (Šumava National Park). The Hochficht in the cross-border Bohemian Forest is part of the municipality of Klaffer. The municipalities of Aigen and Ulrichsberg are also not far away and benefit from tourism with high overnighting numbers in the local inns and guest houses.
Winter sports area.
The Hochficht is also a winter sports area, which covers the three adjacent mountain of "Zwieselberg" (), "Reischlberg" () and "Hochficht", and is open annually to the end of March or early April (usually until Easter). The start of the ski season here depends on the weather. There are 8 pistes with a total length of around 20 km and a ski route. They are served by 2 drag lifts and three 4-seater chair lifts ("Hochfichtbahn" since 1994, "Schwarzenbergbahn" since 2001, "Zwieselbergbahn" since 2004) Since 2017 the 10-seater, 2-leg gondola lift, the "Reischlbergbahn", has transported skiers up the "Reischlberg". The longest ski run is the Stierwiesen run from the Hochficht, the second longest is the FIS run, on which Europacup races take place. At the Zwieselberg there is also a FIS slalom run, where Europacup races also take place. The majority of pistes (55%) are rated as easy. The valley station is at 800 m. Six langlauf routes, three of which are free, with a total length of around 165 km complete the winter sports facilities.
Hiking.
In summer all the lifts are closed and there is only a small café open. Several hiking trails, including the Nordwaldkammweg from the tripoint to the Waldviertel, run over the summit; in addition there are viewing points at Stinglfelsen () and Schönbergfelsen ().

Visconti di Modrone

The Visconti di Modrone are a collateral branch of the Visconti of Milan. The branch originated in the 17th century and still exists today.
During the last two centuries, a number of members of the lineage have achieved prominence in different domains of public life including theatre and cinema director Luchino Visconti.
Origins.
The Visconti di Modrone descend from Uberto, younger brother of Matteo Visconti, Lord of Milan between 1287 and 1322. Since the main residence of the first generations of Uberto's offspring was in the castle of Somma Lombardo, they were known by the surname of Visconti di Somma.
In 1473, the castle and other family properties were divided by the two brothers Francesco and Guido Visconti di Somma. In 1683, Niccolò Visconti, a descendant of Guido, married Teresa Modroni, originating the Visconti di Modrone lineage.
The origins of the Visconti di Modrone can be recognised in their current peerages. The title of Count of Lonate Pozzolo traces back to the properties and noble rights in Lonate Pozzolo, a few kilometres south of Somma Lombardo, received by Guido Visconti di Somma in the division with his brother Francesco.
History.
In 1778, Francesco Antonio Visconti di Modrone, grandson of Niccolò, obtained the title of Marquess of Vimodrone. In 1813, the title of Duke Visconti di Modrone was granted by Napoleon to Carlo Visconti di Modrone (1770–1836).
Between 1884 and 1890, a family mausoleum was erected at Cassago Brianza. Its appearance, inspired by the dome and the spires of the Milan Cathedral, has become part of the local landscape. During the 19th and 20th centuries, industrial undertakings were started by different family members around Milan: silk production in Canegrate, a weaving plant in San Vittore Olona, a bleaching factory in Somma Lombardo, and a cotton mill in Vaprio d'Adda.
At the beginning of the 20th century, Giuseppe Visconti di Modrone (1879–1941), the father of the filmmaker Luchino, renovated a group of hovels and old stables surrounding a medieval family castle located from Piacenza in the municipality of Vigolzone, and transforming them into a village of Middle Age aspect which in the early 20th century was named "Grazzano Visconti". In 1937, the title of Duke of Grazzano Visconti was granted to Giuseppe Visconti by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy. Grazzano Castle, built in 1395 by Giovanni Anguissola, a brother-in-law of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, passed to the Visconti di Modrone family following the death of marchese Filippo Anguissola in 1870. It is still owned by the family.

Erasmo Janer Gironella

José Erasmo Janer Gironella (1833-1911) was a Spanish entrepreneur and politician. As a businessman he is considered a member of the textile-industry-related Catalan bourgeoisie, which enjoyed peak of its power in the mid-19th century; Janer represented this group during its declining phase. Politically he earned his name as a Carlist and headed the Catalan branch of the party between 1902 and 1910.
Family and youth.
Some scholars consider the Janer family past an illustration of social history in Catalonia, its rise and decline demonstrating patterns of change within the local ruling strata. Erasmo's paternal grandfather Domingo Janer Sunyer (1762-1807) was son to a provincial doctor and commenced his career as a petty merchant from Esparreguera; rising to prosperity, he was ennobled in 1795. He married heiress to an emergent Gónima textile fortune; both died prematurely. Their only son and the future father of Erasmo, (1791-1862), inherited the hugely successful business in 1821; at that time it was crowned with the largest European textile factory which employed some 1,200 workers. Himself representative of a new strata of commerce and industry tycoons which started to surpass landed aristocracy and old urban bourgeoisie, in the mid-19th century Janer Gónima brought the family to business and political climax. Member of executive boards of countless economic organizations, he held key positions in municipal administration, served as alcalde of Barcelona in 1846 and as a provincial deputy in the 1850s. In the mid-19th century he shut down the textile factory and re-focused the family business on finance, railways and commerce.
In 1813 Janer Gónima married Josefa Gironella Ayguals, daughter to another Barcelona textile industry tycoon. The couple had 5 or 7 children; out of two sons, it was José Erasmo who became heir to the family wealth. At unspecified time though probably in the 1840s he frequented the Piarist college of St. Anthony in Barcelona, to complete education while studying law at Universidad de Barcelona and graduating most likely in the mid-1850s. Gradually getting engaged in running the family business, in 1864 José Erasmo married Dolores Milá de la Roca Vilaseca; her family, also ennobled merchants, became landowners rather than engaged in potentially profitable but risky urban ventures. Basking in inherited opulence the couple settled in the Janer family residence in Barcelona, in the iconic building known as . 
José Erasmo and Dolores had 7 children, though only two of them married: the second oldest son and the family heir became a locally known historian and writer, while Mercedes wed a Carlist politician Dalmacio Iglesias. Another daughter María de los Angeles became a Carlist propagandist. José Erasmo and Dolores had 5 grandchildren; both grandsons were youth Carlist activists during the Second Republic years and requeté volunteers during the Civil War. The older one, Erasmo Janer Duran, was executed by the Republicans; the younger one, Enrique Janer Duran, survived the war to become a lawyer; since the early 1940s till the late 1970s he held various mid-range positions in the Barcelona city council, from secretary of the ayuntamiento to teniente auditor, jefé de sección and head of the transport department. As neither Erasmo nor Enrique had sons, the Janer line has extinguished. The nephews of José Erasmo, and , became known in local Catalan realm respectively as a writer and as a painter.
Conservative to Carlist (1864-1876).
As heir to the former mayor of Barcelona and son to one of the most potent men in the city Janer was destined to become a public figure, yet political preferences of his ancestors are not entirely clear. Historians note that as tycoons of new bourgeoisie the Janers and the Gónimas were Liberals, while the Gironellas were even related to the revolutionary exaltado version of Spanish liberalism. One source claims that during the First Carlist War his father joined the liberal Barcelona juntas while another one states that in the mid-1840s he was a Traditionalist, which might point to not an unusual conservative evolution of certain section of the . One author notes that Janer himself sort of neared Traditionalist outlook during his academic years, yet his first public engagements did not demonstrate such a penchant. In the late 1850s and early 1860s he was noted for engagement in various institutions related to local business, recorded as member of and an insurance company "La Providencia" or sitting in the board of Asociación de Socorros y Protección a la Clase Obrera y Jornalera and in Junta de Patronato of his Barcelona borough. One source claims he initially practiced as a lawyer.
In the mid-1860s Janer was first noted running for public office, as propietario and haciendario competing for the concejal post in the Barcelona ayuntamiento; there is no confirmation of his success. It seems that during final years of the Isabelline monarchy he neared the entourage of the then capitán general of Catalonia and the Conservative politician, ; Janer used to address him in public homage letters and was nominated by Pezuela to the last Isabelline city council, where he was sitting as the youngest concejal until the body was dissolved during the 1868 revolution.
One author claims that Janer passed from Conservative to Carlist position when faced with the revolutionary developments of the late 1860s. Some sources maintain he fielded his candidature in elections to the Constituent Assembly of 1869 and indeed in 1871 he was already reported as nominated by the regional Carlist junta as their representative in the Cortes elections from Sant Feliu de Llobregat, the bid which proved unsuccessful. In 1872 Janer became president of Círculo Católico-Monárquico in Barcelona and entered the provincial party executive, noted as member of the Barcelona Junta Provincial Católico-Monárquica. In the council he was sitting with his father-in-law, Manuel Milá de la Roca, and forged the lifelong friendship with the junta leader and later Catalan Carlist leader, Luis de Llauder y Dalmases. Following outbreak of the Third Carlist War Janer found himself the target of Republican persecutions and had to flee the city a number of times. Eventually with his family he sought exile in France and settled in Saint Jean de Luz. According to one source he joined a small team, led by Tírso de Olazábal and busy procuring arms for the Carlist troops; it is likely that taking advantage of his wealth, Janer contributed financially.
In the second row (1877-1888).
It is not clear whether Janer's massive property was embargoed during the war, whether he suffered any other persecutions and when he returned to Barcelona after the Carlist military defeat. A number of sources point vaguely to the late 1870s when claiming that together with Milá de la Roca and Llauder Janer was among co-founders of a new Carlist daily which would remain in print for the following 60 years, "". In 1879 he entered the Barcelona ayuntamiento yet duration of his term is not known; except an 1888 spell in Junta Municipal it proved to be a unique Janer's episode in official administration. In the 1880s he was noted rather for looking after his family enterprises, especially in Caja de Ahorros. However, some scholars claim that he demonstrated neither interest nor skills in commercial activities and that during his tenure the family business went into decline; some go as far as to claim that to sustain the Carlist cause he kept selling off his private property or even that he ruined his fortune with the legitimist zeal. Janer was also known for engagement in numerous public initiatives, often flavored with charity: he held executive or presidential positions in Junta de Obra, Junta de la Beneficiencia in his Nuestra Señora del Carmen parish, Real Archicofradía de la Virgén de los Dolores, Junta Local de Salvament de Náufrags and various makeshift committees, e.g. the body assisting victims of the 1885 earthquake in Andalusia.
In the 1880s Carlism did not exist as organized structures present in the Spanish public life; the movement languished as a set of loose quasi-political initiatives flavored with Traditionalist spirit and intransigent religiosity. Part of this strategy was mobilizing support by means of mass pilgrimages; Janer contributed as member of the Barcelona Junta Organizativa branch, which co-ordinated the 1882 romería to Rome. Adhering to the same line he used to sign various public letters denouncing perceived injustice to the Catholics and secular course of the government, e.g. the entire Janer family subscribed to an 1883 document which protested curtailment of Catholic rights; in 1884 he emerged as leader of the Catalan branch of Asociación Católica. Stress on religious features, focus on Traditionalist values and de-emphasizing of dynastical threads was very much the vision of the Carlist political leader and later his son Ramón. Janer seemed on perfect terms with both despite the fact that the Nocedalistas, known also as Integrists, were increasingly on collision course with the claimant Don Carlos; as late as in 1886 Janer took part in a homage banquet honoring Ramón Nocedal. However, when in 1888 the Integrists broke away from Carlism to form their own Traditionalist organization Janer decided to stay loyal to his king; in 1889 he was already lambasted by the Integrists as the sidekick of Llauder.
Deputy leader (1889-1901).
Following the Integrist secession Carlism abandoned its quasi-political format of the 1880s and assumed a decisively more active political stance; the nationwide structures started to emerge, initially styled as committees celebrating 1,400 years since the . In Catalonia the organization was headed by Llauder, yet Janer – together with Manuel de Torrents – was nominated its vice-president, effectively the second-in-command in the regional party infrastructure. However, his contribution to Carlist buildup seems meager. Though Carlist candidates started to take part in electoral campaigns and under the new nationwide leadership of Marqués de Cerralbo the movement took shape of an organized modern political party, there is little information on Janer's public activity in the early 1890s. Despite consolidation and growth of Catalan Carlism under the regional leadership of Llauder, Janer neither stood as candidate in elections nor was recorded as active in supporting electoral campaigns. While de Cerralbo was striving to implement a new formula of mass mobilization Janer seemed attached rather to old-style patterns and at best took part in closed-door party feasts, like the one in 1893. His popular initiatives stuck to the pilgrimage format, e.g. when organizing workers' romería to Rome in 1894 or signing homage letter to the papal nuncio; the document protested the governmental secularization policy.
In 1895 Janer was officially confirmed by de Cerralbo as vice-president of the Catalan Carlist organization, yet he still remained in the shadow of Llauder. He was barely mentioned when new party círculos in the region were being opened, typically noted when presiding over official banquets or entertaining royal Carlist figures, e.g. the second wife of the claimant Berthe do Rohan, who visited Barcelona in 1896. Though historiographic studies either on Catalan or nationwide Carlism of the 1890s barely mention his name, de Cerralbo was apparently satisfied with Janer's contribution to the cause; Jefe Delegado addressed him with effusive letters of gratitude and thanked him for electoral efforts; press of the era provides little evidence of such support. Actually, it seems that in the late 1890s the Catalan Carlism was vibrant yet increasingly leaderless and disorganized. Since 1898 due to his poor health Llauder's leadership became largely theoretical, while the movement was plagued by personal squabbles, emerging social radicalism, urban pistolerismo, Catalanist sympathies and insurrectional currents. None of the sources consulted mentions Janer when discussing the local . The press noted that in the very first years of the 20th century the Catalan Carlism was led by 3 competitive juntas: 1) the old one headed by Llauder, 2) the new one appointed by recently nominated Jefe Delegado Matiás Barrio and headed by Duque de Solferino, and 3) the one associated with , headed by Janer; this claim is not confirmed by other sources. Following the death of Llauder and despite rumors pointing to Solferino, following Janer's visit to Don Carlos' residence in Venice in 1902 the claimant nominated him the new Catalan leader.
"Jefe" (1902-1910).
Janer's tenure fell on a period when Catalan Carlism was challenged by massive social and political change, the decade which shifted the region's centre of gravity from rural traditional hinterland to the coastal strip, dominated by new urban classes. The rising Catalanist and anti-establishment tide gave rise to Solidaridad Catalana; on the one hand the Carlists were attracted by its opposition to the Restoration regime, on the other they were estranged by Republican, nationalist and secularist features of the alliance. Janer, who in 1903-1905 limited himself to making appointments and presiding over party feasts, in 1906 gave in to the pressure of pro-Solidaridad Carlists like Solferino and Junyent and permitted access to the pact. His key concern was that only authorized individuals were allowed to stand on joint electoral lists and that the move did not go beyond a temporary tactical cooperation. Faced with anti-Solidaridad opposition in the party ranks he enforced discipline yet it seems he kept vacillating himself. Carlist access was rewarded with great success in the 1907 elections but it seems that Janer had few regrets when the alliance fell apart in 1908, even though debates persisted until 1909.
Another problem Janer had to face as a regional leader was the insurrectional tide, rising among the Catalan Carlists. Though the 1900 preparations boiled down to few isolated attempts some sections of the party kept gearing up for a violent overthrow of the regime. Janer called for discipline and tried to marginalize the radicals; when in 1906 they staged a , easily crushed by the government forces, Janer first disauthorised the action and then expulsed the insurrectionists from the party, again in full agreement with the claimant. However, the dissent was mounting, fuelled also by personal squabbles and issues related to tactical alliances with the Alfonsists; to enforce discipline at times Janer opted for dissolution of municipal or even provincial party jefaturas. A few local party heavyweights like Tamarít grumbled against Janer and some, like Solferino, resigned in protest.
Janer seemed overwhelmed by problems and apparent decomposition of the party in Catalonia; he first tried to step down in 1906, but his resignation was not accepted by the claimant; in 1908 he again handed over his resignation, also to no avail. Contemporary press noted that Janer was a great Christian, grand citizen and by all means an extraordinary person, but neither a good leader nor an impressive politician, tending to inactivity and with scarce faith in the cause. He is not recorded as engaged in heated debates shaping the nationwide Carlist politics. In 1910 Janer eventually got his resignation accepted by the new Carlist king Don Jaime, who appointed Solferino his successor. The reason quoted was Janer's poor health and indeed it seems that his life force deteriorated, especially after the 1910 death of his wife. Following resignation he mostly withdrew into privacy and in public remained engaged only in family business, until death performing managerial duties in Caja de Ahorros.

Villa Albergoni

Villa Albergoni is a villa (or country mansion) in Moscazzano, Cremona, Lombardy, northern Italy that dates back to the 16th-century. Due to previous owners, it is also known as "Palazzo" or "Villa Vimercati", "Villa Griffoni" or "Villa Sant'Angelo". It is located at 3, Via Montodine.
History.
Villa Albergoni is located on a plateau near the Adda river, in a marshy area that was politically difficult to control on the border between the Republic of Venice and the Duchy of Milan. The early document "Desegnio di Crema et del Cremasco", published in Venice between 1482 and 1497, describes Crema as a fortified village with crenelated houses and an isolated watchtower.
The powerful Milanese Vimercati family settled in Crema, probably in the 13th century, and the fiefdom of Moscazzano was entrusted in 1499. Around that time, the family probably also started to transform the ruins of a previous castle into a country residence. According to a map dating from around 1650, in the archive of the Marazzi family, the villa was designed with a cubic body and a four-pitched roof, but without the two current towers. Further renovations and rebuilding work took place in the next few centuries, notably in the 18th century when the villa got its main appearance. Angela Vimercati Sanseverino, daughter of the owners of the villa, married the Count of Griffoni Sant'Angelo and in 1776, the building became property of the Griffoni Sant'Angelo family. Further modernisation work was done in the interior. An engraving depicting the villa with the garden and the pond was made by Finoli Bassano in honour of Count Angelo Griffoni, who was owner from 1823 until his death in 1852. With his death, the Griffoni family became extinct in the male line. 
The last restoration work was started by the entrepreneur Giuseppe Perletti, who purchased the villa in 1865. The works continued under his nephew Saverio Stramezzi, who became the subsequent owner. The west wing, including the passage corridor, was completely demolished, freeing the tower. Also demolished was the eastern wing, but the wing was later rebuilt in a reduced size. During this period, the building received its austere exterior. The garden was also simplified, due to cost. 
In 1877, the villa came into the possession of the Stramezzi family until 1958. In 1961, Pierro Albergoni and his wife Corinna Emanueli became the new owners. The villa was put up for sale in 2018 for an asking price of €1.7 million.
Architecture.
Villa Albergoni is set in and includes annexed minor buildings. The main part of the villa has a square plan with a front portico on the north side and two towers situated at the corners; on the east side of the building is a service wing that was added in the 19th century. The main building has ; it has 14 rooms and 7 bathrooms, spread out on the ground floor and first floor, with an attic under the roof. The main façade is characterized by a portico, above which is a terrace accessible from the first floor. The wooden entrance door is coffered with central roses. Inside the villa is a large entranceway with a barrel-vaulted ceiling and terrazzo floor, which goes to the back of the building. On either sides are the main hall, the library and two other rooms, and in the middle is the main staircase. The main hall has a frescoed ceiling; other rooms also have frescoes, some of which were done in the 16th century by Aurelio Busso, a student of Raphael. Both the main hall and the library have carved stone fireplaces and terrazzo floors.
The first floor of the main building has a layout similar to that of the ground floor, with a large central hallway and four large rooms with private bathrooms and a smaller room. The rooms have timber-coffered ceilings and parquet floors. The cellar is located in the centre of the villa; it is accessible by the main staircase.
The two annexed buildings are the house of the steward on the west side of the property, and to the left of the main gate is a minor building that was used by the guard.
In popular culture.
The villa served as the main set in the Academy Award-winning film "Call Me by Your Name" (2017). The interior was decorated for the film by Violante Visconti di Modrone, a relative of Luchino Visconti.

"Luca" was released on 28 June 2019. A Telugu version of the film titled "Luca Alias Johnny" was released on the streaming service Aha.
Reception.
Luca's fear of death, love, and suicide romanticism received mixed reviews from critics. Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion South wrote "But even if Luca never becomes the Great Love Story the makers were trying for, it's an easy watch. The sensuality of the imagery has an almost tactile quality. Mere technique cannot make a movie, but it can make us believe that a movie like Luca is better than it really is."

Cooper H. Langford

Cooper Harold Langford III (October 14, 1934 – March 11, 2018) was an American-born Canadian chemist.
He was born to the philosopher Cooper Harold Langford and his first wife, Susan Coffman, in Ann Arbor, Michigan on October 14, 1934. He attended Harvard University as an undergraduate, and Northwestern University for graduate studies. His work at Northwestern and his postgraduate work at University College London and Columbia University resulted in the publication (with Harry_B._Gray) of Ligand Substitution Processes (1966) The Langford-Gray classification remains an important tool to describe the mechanics of inorganic chemical reactions.
Langford taught at Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada, Concordia University in Montreal, Canada, and the University of Calgary in Calgary, Canada.
Committed throughout his life both to undergraduate teaching and research, his interests continued to expand throughout his career. His research in photochemistry contributed to environmental science (particularly soil decontamination, waste treatment, and small-community water systems). In collaboration with his wife, the economic historian Dr. Martha Whitney Langford (b. 1938- d. 2009) , he pursued research into science policy in Canada, as well as the dynamics of scientific, economic, and entrepreneurial innovation.
He served as associate vice-rector for research at Concordia University, and as vice-president (Research) at the University of Calgary, as well as many roles in federal and provincial research agencies, and scientific organizations, including the Arctic Institute of North America, THECIS (The Center for Innovation Studies) , and the Calgary Science Center (later known as Telus Spark) . He was granted fellowship of the Royal Society of Canada in 1992. 
Langford was the co-author of two significant introductory chemistry textbooks. The Development of Chemical Principles (1969, reprinted 1995, with Ralph A. Beebe) was designed to guide undergraduate students through the fundamentals of chemistry by following the history of their development. He also co-wrote the first and second editions of Inorganic Chemistry (1990, with Peter Atkins and Duard F. Shriver).
Cooper died of pancreatic cancer on March 11, 2018, while seeking treatment at the Vernon Jubilee Hospital in Vernon, British Columbia.

Discovery Seamounts

Discovery Seamounts are a chain of seamounts in the Southern Atlantic Ocean, which include the Discovery Seamount. The seamounts lie east of Gough Island and once rose above sea level. Various volcanic rocks as well as glacial dropstones and sediments have been dredged from the seamounts.
The Discovery Seamounts appear to be a volcanic seamount chain controlled by the Discovery hotspot, which had its starting point either in the ocean, Cretaceous kimberlite fields in southern Namibia or the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province. The seamounts formed between 41 and 35 million years ago; presently the hotspot is thought to lie southwest of the seamounts, where there are geological anomalies in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that may reflect the presence of a neighbouring hotspot.
Name and discovery.
Discovery Seamount was discovered in 1936 by the research ship "RRS Discovery II" and was originally named Discovery Bank by the crew of a German research ship, RV "Schwabenland". The seamount received another name, Discovery Tablemount, in 1963. In 1993 the name "Discovery Bank" was transferred by the General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans to another seamount at Kerguelen, leaving the name "Discovery Seamounts" for the seamounts.
Geography and geomorphology.
The Discovery Seamounts are a group of seamounts east of Gough Island and southwest from Cape Town which extend over an east-west region of over length. The seamounts rise over to depths of and have the shape of guyots; this implies that they formerly rose above sea level, guyots form when islands are eroded to a flat plateau that is then submerged through thermal subsidence of the lithosphere. The shallowest peak reached by a seamount from the group is a depth of , although a depth of has been reported for Discovery Seamount also. These seamounts are also referred to as the Discovery Rise and subdivided into a northwestern and a southeastern trend. 
The largest of these seamounts is named Discovery Seamount, which given its shape might once have been an island. The seamount is covered with fossil-containing sediments, which have been used to infer paleoclimate conditions in the region during the Pleistocene. Some of the sediment appears to be ice-rafted debris, and other evidence has been used to postulate that the seamount subsided by about during the late Pleistocene. Another member of the Discovery Seamounts has been christened Shannon Seamount.
The crust underneath Discovery Seamount is about 67 million years old, thus of late Cretaceous age. A fracture zone, thus a site of crustal weakness, is located nearby. 
Geology.
The Southern Atlantic Ocean contains a number of volcanic systems such as the Discovery Seamounts, the Rio Grande Rise, the Shona Ridge and the Walvis Ridge which are commonly attributed to hotspots, although this interpretation has been challenged. The hotspot origin of Discovery and the Walvis-Tristan da Cunha seamount chains was first proposed in 1972. In the case of the Shona Ridge and the Discovery Seamounts, the theory postulates that they formed as the African Plate moved over the Shona hotspot and the Discovery hotspot.
It is not clear if a Discovery Hotspot exists, nor whether it is linked in any way to Gough Island or to the Tristan hotspot. The formation of the Discovery Seamounts may instead have been caused by ascent of magma along a fracture zone or other crustal weakness. If the hotspot does exist, it would have to be located southwest of the Discovery Seamounts where low seismic velocity anomalies have been detected in the mantle. The Discovery Seamounts almost wane out in that direction although it has been proposed that the Little Ridge close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge may be their continuation. The Discovery Ridge close to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge may be the product of the hotspot as well; magma flowing from the Discovery hotspot to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge may be leading to excessive production of crustal material there.
Petrological anomalies at spreading ridges have been often attributed to the presence of mantle plumes close to the ridge and such has been proposed for the Discovery hotspot as well. There is a region on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge southwest of the seamounts where there are fewer earthquakes than elsewhere along the ridge, the central valley of the ridge is absent and where dredged rocks share geochemical traits with the Discovery Seamount; that may be the location of the Discovery Hotspot. A position about halfway between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Discovery Seamounts has been inferred. The Discovery hotspot may be connected to the Tristan hotspot deep in the mantle.
The South Atlantic features one of the largest transform faults of Earth, the Agulhas-Falkland fracture zone. This transform fault has an unusual structure on the African Plate, where it displays the Agulhas Ridge, two over high ridge segments which are parallel to each other. This unusual structure may be due to magma from the Discovery hotspot, which would have been channelled to the Agulhas Ridge.
Composition.
Rocks dredged from the seamounts include lavas, pillow lavas and volcaniclastic rocks. Geochemically they are classified as alkali basalt, basalt, phonolite, tephriphonolite trachyandesite, trachybasalt and trachyte. Minerals contained in the rocks include alkali feldspar, apatite, biotite, clinopyroxene, iron and titanium oxides, olivine, plagioclase, sphene and spinel. Continental crust rocks dredged at the seamounts may be glacial dropstones, manganese have also been found.
The Discovery hotspot appears to have erupted two separate sets of magmas with distinct compositions, similar to the Tristan da Cunha-Gough Island hotspot. The composition of the Discovery Seamounts rocks has been compared to Gough Island. The more felsic rocks at Discovery appear to be derived from magma chamber processes, similar to felsic rocks at other Atlantic Ocean islands.
Biology.
Soviet fishery during the 1970s and 1980s and others have found 150 fish species at Discovery Seamount. Both Japanese and Soviet trawled the seamounts during that time, but there was no commercial exploitation of the resources. Among animals is "Conophora verrucosa", a stylasteride hydrozoan while fish species there include the pygmy flounder; the codling "Guttigadus nudirostre" is endemic to Discovery Seamount. Fossil corals have been recovered in dredges.
Eruption history.
A number of dates ranging from 41 to 35 million years ago have been obtained on dredged samples from the seamounts on the basis of argon-argon dating, but at Discovery Seamount it may have continued until 7-6.5 million years ago. The age of the seamounts decreases in southwest direction, similar to the Walvis Ridge, and at a similar rate. It is possible that Discovery Seamount was split into a northern and southern part about 20 million years ago.
Unlike the Walvis Ridge, which is connected to the Etendeka flood basalts, the Discovery Seamounts do not link with onshore volcanic features. However, it has been proposed that the 70-80 million years old Blue Hills, Gibeon and Gross Brukkaros kimberlite fields in southern Namibia may have been formed by the Discovery hotspot, and some plate reconstructions place it underneath the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province at the time at which it was emplaced. Between 60 and 40 million years ago it was located close to the spreading ridge of the South Atlantic.

Oxygenic photogranules

 Oxygenic photogranules (OPGs) are a type of biological aggregate with an approximately spherical form, typically from a millimeter to a centimeter scale. OPGs are characterized by the cloth-like layer of phototrophic organisms, predominantly filamentous cyanobacteria of the order Oscillatoriales. Oxygen production by these phototrophs through photosynthesis is typically coupled to oxygen consumption of heterotrophic biomass, releasing CO2 that is presumably utilised in a syntrophic relationship by autotrophic phototrophs.
Discovery/Context.
In 2011, Park and Dolan first observed the transformation of activated sludge into oxygenic photogranule (OPG)., when incubated in unagitated and sealed vials exposed to natural light for several months. Since then, this static cultivation of OPG was observed with activated sludge coming from various places over the world in several laboratories (,, etc.). &lt;br&gt;
OPGs were discovered recently and serendipitously in laboratory conditions, but very similar granules, called cryoconites, are found in glaciers
Formation of oxygenic photogranules.
Anaerobic and aerobic granule formation are typically postulated to be driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout. Oxygenic photogranules do form when exposed to hydrodynamic shear in sequencing batch reactors; however, they also form under static batch&amp;. They can form over the course of several weeks from a source of activated sludge exposed to light. How oxygenic photogranules form is far from understood, but filamentous and motile cyanobacteria seem to play an essential role in their formation. Cyanobacteria are enriched from the activated sludge and form the outer layer of photogranules that gives structural integrity for both photogranules generated under hydrodynamic and static conditions.&lt;br&gt;
This hypothesis is supported by the finding that the initial presence of inorganic nitrogen in the activated sludge inoculum promotes cyanobacterial growth over microalgal growth, resulting in successful oxygenic photogranules. &lt;br&gt;
Oxygenic photogranule formation is thus not driven by hydrodynamic shear and washout are not required for the formation of oxygenic photogranules, even though these factors may play an important role when applied. Filamentous, motile cyanobacteria play a key role, but exact mechanisms have to be elucidated to be able to control the formation and properties of oxygenic photogranules and apply them to bioengineering processes.
Oxygenic photogranules applied to wastewater treatment.
Oxygenic photogranules is a new type of biogranules that has not been applied in bioengineering processes yet. but has promising potentials to be applied in wastewater treatment. OPG have been applied in turbulently mixed sequencing batch reactors SBR and in high rate algal pond. Oxygenic photogranules have the ability to couple oxygen production through photosynthesis to conversion of organic matter into carbon dioxide by heterotrophs. Therefore, they have the potential to treat wastewater without external source of aeration and to generate energy when this biodegradable biofeedstock is used for anaerobic digestion

2018 Australian federal budget

The 2018 Australian federal budget was the federal budget to fund government services and operations for the 2018–19 financial year. The budget was presented to the House of Representatives by Treasurer Scott Morrison on 8 May 2018. It was the fifth budget to be handed down by the Liberal/National Coalition since their election to government at the 2013 federal election, and the third and final budget to be handed down by Morrison and the Turnbull Government.
Background.
In mid-April, Acting Prime Minister Michael McCormack described Treasurer Scott Morrison as "Santa Claus" in an interview with the "Daily Telegraph", also hinting that there would be spending on transport infrastructure. Morrison stated that the $5 billion Melbourne Airport rail link would be part of this budget. There has been an increase in revenue recently due to stronger than expected commodity prices and an increase in employment.
This budget has been described as effectively a pre-election budget for the 2019 federal election. Polling prior to the budget revealed that the public thought the most important issues for the government to address were the cost of living and improving health infrastructure. Student newspapers were not invited to the 2018 budget lockup.
Forecasting.
A Deloitte Access report issued in April 2018 found that total revenue was $7.6 billion more than had been forecast in December 2017.
Income taxes.
The budget proposes to introduce a Low and Middle Income Tax Offset (LMITO) of $530, from July 2018. This offset will not be reflected in adjustments to PAYG rates, which would translate to a PAYG cut of about $10 a week for low to middle income earners, but will be applied when the tax returns are lodged. The LMITO will not be a refundable offset. From July 2022, the 32.5% tax bracket is to raise from $37,000 to $41,000. From July 2024, the 37% tax bracket (which currently applies to incomes between $87,000 and $180,000) is to be abolished, and the 32.5% tax bracket is to apply to incomes between $41,000 and $200,000.
The 0.5% increase in the Medicare levy from 1 July 2019, announced in the 2017 budget, has been abandoned, and the funding of the National Disability Insurance Scheme of $8 billion is now to be funded out of general revenue.
The Government still wants to reduce the corporate income tax rate from 30% to 25% for all companies by 2026/27. From 1 July 2019, businesses with a turnover of less than $50 million will get a 2.5% tax break to 27.5%.
Social welfare.
The Social Welfare Debt Recovery scheme (dubbed robo-debt by the media) will be extended for another three years, until 2022, and is expected to recover $300 million from current and former Centrelink customers. The Commonwealth will seek the power to automatically deduct state fines from welfare payments. The rules for suspending the disability support pension for prisoners and people awaiting trial will be changed from allowing a suspension period of 2 years to allowing a suspension period of 13 weeks.
There is to be no increase in the Newstart Allowance, and the Department of Human Services was targeted with further 1,200 job cuts.
Spending on social security was $6.3b less than forecast in this budget.
Programs and expenditure.
Aged care.
Home care packages will be increased by 14,000 places. It has been noted that this measure will not meet demand in the sector.
Agriculture.
Sea imports will be subject to a levy to help the government identify and respond to biosecurity threats. The macadamia levy has been increased to raise funds to combat the "Varroa jacobsoni" mite in Queensland, and the mushroom and honey levies have been decreased.
Arts.
The funding freeze of the ABC will be continued, and SBS will be funded with an additional $14.6 million. $50 million will be allocated to the construction of a Captain Cook memorial at Kurnell commemorating the 250th anniversary of Captain Cook's landing.
ASIC.
ASIC was given $11 million in the budget to cover the costs of the Royal Commission into Misconduct in the Banking, Superannuation and Financial Services Industry, but lost $28 million of funding and 30 staff.
Cash transactions.
A limit of $10,000 will be imposed on cash transactions to counter the black economy. While amnesties were recommended by a parliamentary committee, these were not adopted by the government.
Illicit tobacco.
A four-year program targeting illicit tobacco is expected to be announced, with import permits required from 1 July 2019 for all imports of tobacco except those purchased duty free.
Infrastructure.
There will be an infrastructure spend of $24.5 billion in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
National School Chaplaincy Programme.
The National School Chaplaincy Programme has been extended for four years with funding of $247 million.
Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
Additional medicines will be added to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, for the treatment of breast cancer, refractory multiple myeloma, and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Additionally, pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV/AIDS will be added to the PBS.
Self-managed superannuation auditing.
The requirement for self-managed superannuation to be audited annually has been relaxed to allow auditing to occur once every three years.
Space agency.
$50 million will be allocated to the creation of a space agency.
Superannuation consolidation.
Fund exit fees are to be banned. The Australian Tax Office will be given powers to consolidate superannuation from a person's inactive accounts, sending it to their active account. Superannuation accounts that have had no contributions for over 13 months and that have a balance of under $6,000 will be subject to this scheme from 1 July 2019.
Women's Budget.
An analysis of how the budget measures will affect women has concluded that the taper effect will create a disincentive to work. A statement on women's economic security will be unveiled by Kelly O'Dwyer in spring 2018.
Debt and deficit.
The Budget deficit for 2017/18 is expected to be $18.2 billion, falling to $14.5 billion in 2018/19. The Budget is expected to return to a surplus of $2.2 billion in 2019/20, and increasing to $16.6 billion in 2021/22.
The government's debt level is forecast to be $629 billion in 2019/20.
Opposition and crossbench response.
Upfront fees for up to 100,000 TAFE students will be scrapped.
The Greens party has stated that they will refuse to pass the tax cuts advocated by either major party, describing them as a "bribe".
Reception.
In response to an anticipated tax cut, the hashtag #keepmytendollars trended on social media.
Some people have criticized the New tax System with Australians earning between $41,000 and $200,000 paying the same tax as moving away from a progressive taxation system. Labor has asked for the potential costs from scrapping the 37% tax bracket, but Morrison has declined to release the cost modelling.
Analysis of the budget and budget reply by Australian National University researchers shows that neither proposed budget adequately addresses bracket creep.
This budget marks the fifth consecutive year that Australia's foreign aid budget has been cut.
The second stage of the Coalition's company tax cuts for big business was rejected by the Senate on 22 August 2018.

Harry Johnston (footballer, born 1949)

Harry Grant Forsyth Johnston (born 24 December 1949), also known as Grant Johnston and H. G. F. Johnston, is a Scottish retired footballer who played as a midfielder, featuring briefly in the country's top division for Partick Thistle between longer spells with Montrose. He is also a former cricketer who played first-class matches for Scotland in 1975 and 1981.
Football career.
First spell at Montrose.
Born in Orkney and raised in Aberdeen, Johnston began his career with local Junior club Lewis United, from where he was signed by semi-professional Montrose, then playing in the lower of the two divisions of the Scottish Football League. He was brought in to the "Gable Endies" by player-manager Alex Stuart in 1970, around the same time as defenders Dennis D'Arcy and Les Barr arrived.
All would play important roles in the Links Park club's gradual improvement in fortunes, as they followed up a win in the 1972–73 Forfarshire Cup with a best-ever finish of 3rd in the 1974–75 Scottish Division Two campaign, just one point behind winners Falkirk. To finish near the top of the table was particularly important that year as the leagues were reconstructed, with only the top six being placed into the new 'First Division', which was actually the middle level between the Premier and the Second. Montrose also recorded their longest unbeaten league run of 15 matches, and set their record margin of victory with a 12–0 win over amateurs Vale of Leithen in the 1974–75 Scottish Cup.
The following year was even better, as Montrose finished 3rd again – but this time among stronger opposition – in the 1975–76 Scottish First Division. They also made it to the quarter-finals of the 1975–76 Scottish Cup, losing narrowly to eventual finalists Heart of Midlothian after two replays, and reached the semi-final of the 1975–76 Scottish League Cup, where they led for much of the tie against Rangers at Hampden Park before eventually succumbing 5–1 to the team who would lift the trophy.
Partick Thistle.
The contribution of Johnston (who by now had successfully graduated from Jordanhill College to become a Physical education teacher) in Montrose's strong period had not gone unnoticed, and in summer 1976, after over 200 matches for the Angus club, he was approached by Partick Thistle, who had just achieved promotion to the Premier Division. the "Jags" manager Bertie Auld stated in his autobiography that he had to persuade Johnston to make the step up, as the player was unsure if he had the quality needed. After signing for a fee of £20,000, his spell with the Glasgow club was short, encompassing little more than one season due to injuries and a loss of trust from manager Auld, himself a combative character who eventually concluded that Johnston had been correct in his self-assessment of being not good enough for the top division, or at least not sufficiently confident in his own ability to make an impact.
However, the midfielder did contribute 14 league appearances to the team which finished 5th in the 1976–77 Scottish Premier Division, playing alongside the likes of Scottish internationals Alan Hansen, John Hansen and Alan Rough, as well as Jim Melrose and Doug Somner. He was in the team for Thistle's first win in the new Premier Division (beating Motherwell), and two of his three goals were scored against Rangers, one in a defeat at Ibrox and the other to open the scoring in a 4–3 win at Firhill, with the third strike a winner against Kilmarnock. After a period out injured and a loan to third tier Brechin City, Johnston returned to Montrose in 1979, with the club having just been relegated to the bottom division.
Return to Montrose and later years.
Johnston spent three further seasons with Montrose and two with Stenhousemuir, who were playing at the same level and closer to his home and workplace in the Central Belt, amassing 128 further league appearances between the two clubs, before returning to the Juniors with Viewpark-based Thorniewood United in his mid-30s prior to retiring. He was made a member of the Montrose Hall of Fame upon its introduction in 2004.
Cricket career.
Johnston was also an accomplished cricketer, appearing at club level for Aberdeenshire in his early career and later for Uddingston and Fauldhouse Victoria. A skilled spin bowler and batter, he was selected for Scotland for first-class cricket matches against Ireland at Rathmines in August 1975, and against the same opposition at Clontarf in July 1981.
He also made the team for 17 List A matches: 16 in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup (between 1980, the first year Scotland entered a team, and 1984), plus one in the NatWest Bank Trophy in 1983.
The high-level appearance totals would almost certainly have been greater had Johnston not absented himself from cricket between 1976 and 1979 to concentrate on football.
Personal life.
Johnston became a secondary school PE teacher by profession; he had already embarked on this career when his profile as a footballer began to increase in his mid-20s, and spent many years teaching at Stonelaw High School in Rutherglen. He never became the department's principal teacher nor served as the school's football coach, those responsibilities falling to colleagues Alan Byrne and Iain Burns respectively, but was involved in youth cricket coaching.

Alfred Laubmann

Alfred Louis Laubmann (20 October 1886 - 18 October 1965) was a German zoologist and ornithologist who worked as curator at the Bavarian State Collection of Zoology in Munich. He worked on avian systematics and was a proponent of extending the trinomial system of subspecies into a quadrinomial system.
Laubmann was born in the merchant family of Eugen Laubmann and Ida. He studied at the local elementary school in Kaufbeuren before studying at the Wilhelms gymnasium in Munich. He then moved in 1906 to Ludwig-Maximilians University at Munich to study zoology. He worked on his doctorate under Richard von Hertwig, working on sensory organs in the skin of crayfish. In 1910 he worked at the Roscoff Marine Station. In 1911 he joined the Zoological Museum at Munich to work on the skins collected by Gottfried Merzbacher (1834-1926) from the Tian Shan region. He worked under Carl Hellmayr and was a colleague of Erwin Stresemann. Hellmayr moved to the United States in 1922 which led to Laubmann being promoted head. He became a curator in 1926. He retired in 1951 and was succeeded by Gerd Diesselhorst.
He was a member of the Ornithological Society of Bavaria from 1907 and served as its secretary from 1913 to 1921 and from 1922 as its Secretary General as well as acting editor and publisher of its journal.
He married Elisabeth Mayer in 1912. 
Laubmann described many taxa including the species "Alcedo hercules" and "Otocichla mupinensis". He is also commemorated in the names of several subspecies.

Jan S. Marais

Jan S. Marais (April 23, 1919 - 2009) was a South African banker and politician. He was the founder and chairman of the Trust Bank of Africa, one of South Africa's largest banks. He was a National member of the Parliament of South Africa, and a critic of apartheid.
Early life.
Jan S. Marais was born as Johannes Stephanus Marais on April 23, 1919 in Fraserburg, Northern Cape. He graduated from Stellenbosch University.
Banking career.
Marais was the general manager of Federale Volksbeleggings, an Afrikaner investment company. 
Marais founded the Trust Bank of Africa in 1954, and he served as its chairman. By the 1970s, it had become "one of the country's major banks." Marais subsequently sold the Trust Bank to Sanlam. 
Marais served as the non-executive chairman of FundTrust, an investment company, until it went bankrupt in 1991.
Politics.
Marais was a critic of apartheid. As the chairman of the South Africa Foundation in the 1970s, he argued that the Anti-Apartheid Movement hurt South African businesses. Marais sold Trustbank to join the National Party and served as a member Parliament of South Africa as the representative of Durban, the only time ever that the liberal constituency was won by the National Party. He stood until 1981. He used his platform as a politician to call for the repeal of the Group Areas Act.
Personal life and death.
Dr. Jan S Marais was born in the Karoo, in the town of Fraserburgh, Northern Cape, South Africa. After school, as the oldest son, he had to manage the farm. Within months he reorganized the farm and spend his time reading detective stories and had only one dream, to become a train driver! His father knew better and send him to university where he went from class to class with no direction. 
A senior played a joke on him by inviting him to a statistic class where they were writing a test to Marais's surprise. That was the first time that he thought that he should visit the same class twice. He went back the next week for his results but the lecturer did not hand it out. After class, he asked if there is a Mr. Marais and asked him to stay behind. He handed Marais his test for which he had full marks! After a short interview, he took Marais under his wing up to the time that he went to work for the Federale Volksbeleggings.
From there he was later sent to study in America. He did his Master Degree on Successful People and later with his return to South Africa, started the TrustBank that changed banking worldwide.
The change in his bank's approach towards their clients stemmed from the time that he saw Mary Poppins as a little boy. There was a scene where a child approaches the bank with a little porcelain pig containing all her savings... When she enters the bank the atmosphere was so thick with the counters protected by bars back then. The small child got so scared, dropped her savings and it scattered all over the floor while she was running out. 
Marais decided that day that he would like to change this one day. He felt it should be an inviting, appreciating atmosphere as the bank wants people to entrust their savings with the bank. That was one of many things that made his banking system unique at the time.
One of his claims to fame from those days was that all female workers got hair and clothing allowance and were encouraged to wear mini dresses.
Marais had a wife, Peggy, who died in the 1980s, and an adopted daughter, Carla, she had three children. He resided in Seapoint during the early TrustBank days and later in Cape Town city center. After the Fundtrust debacle, he moved to Durbanville. to his death.
Marais died in 2009.

Tethydraco

Tethydraco is a genus of pterodactyloid pterosaur that lived during the Late Cretaceous period (Maastrichtian stage) of what is now the area of present Morocco, about 66 million years ago. "Tethydraco" was originally assigned to the family Pteranodontidae. Subsequently described material suggested that it was an azhdarchid, but a later study recovered it as a pteranodontid again. The type and only species is T. regalis.
Discovery and naming.
Since 2015, a group of paleontologists has been acquiring pterosaur fossils from commercial Moroccan fossil traders, who obtain these from workers in the phosphate mines on the Khouribga plateau, which is located within the Ouled Abdoun Basin. The purpose of this project is to determine pterosaur diversity in the latest Cretaceous. From this stage, no Konservat-Lagerstätten are known, sites combining a large variety of species with exceptional preservation. It is in such sites that the vast majority of pterosaur fossils and taxa have been discovered. The latest Cretaceous had only produced some partial skeletons of Azhdarchidae. Researchers usually have concluded from this fact that other pterosaur groups had already gone extinct. However, an alternative explanation could be that the poor fossil record caused a distorted image of the true situation through undersampling. To test this hypothesis, an effort was made to collect all pterosaurs bones brought to light by the massive and systematic commercial exploitation of the Khourigba phosphate layers. It transpired that indeed some finds could not be determined as azhdarchids and likely represented other groups. Four of the findings were described as new species in 2018, including Tethydraco.
In 2018, Nicholas R. Longrich, David M. Martill and Brian Andres described and named the type species "Tethydraco regalis". The generic name combines a reference to the Tethys, the ocean in the Late Cretaceous separating Africa from Europe and Asia, with a Latin "draco", "dragon". The specific name means "royal" in Latin.
The holotype, FSAC-OB 1, was found in the middle "Couche III", itself the lowest phosphate layer complex at Sidi Daoui, dating from the late Maastrichtian. It consists of a left humerus. The bone is relatively crushed. Other specimens have been referred to the species. FSAC-OB 199 is an ulna. FSAC-OB 200 is another ulna. FSAC-OB 201 is a thighbone. FSAC-OB 202 consists of a thighbone with shinbone. The describing authors admitted that a connection between the holotype and the referred specimens is hard to prove, in view of the lack of overlapping material. However, the wide ulnae fit the exceptional distal width of the humerus. The thighbones were, more tentatively, referred because they seemed to be pteranodontid.
Description.
The wingspan of "Tethydraco" has been estimated at .
The describing authors indicated some traits in which "Tethydraco" could be distinguished from known pteranodontids. In the humerus, the deltopectoral crest is placed rather proximally, closer to the torso of the animal, its closest border being positioned just proximal to the beginning of the opposite crest, the "crista ulnaris". Distally, away from the torso, the humerus has a broad triangular expansion. The bone ridge running to the outer joint condyle has a distinct process pointing to above, when the wing is in a stretched position. The ridge leading to the inner condyle is enlarged and extends towards the torso over a long distance. The ulna is relatively short and wide while its proximal end, towards the humerus, is massively expanded.
Phylogeny.
"Tethydraco" was placed in the family Pteranodontidae; it would have been the youngest known member of that family, since its fossil remains dated back 66 million years ago. Its existence was seen as proof that pterosaur diversity in the Maastrichtian was higher than previously assumed. Apparent pterosaur decline would have been an illusion caused by the Signor–Lipps effect, groups seeming to disappear earlier than a mass extinction because their youngest fossils by chance have been found at somewhat older layers than the extinction event.
Below is a cladogram showing the results of a phylogenetic analysis first presented by Andres and colleagues in 2014, and updated with additional data by Longrich and colleagues in 2018. In this analysis, they found "Tethydraco" to be the sister taxon of the two species of "Pteranodon" ("P. longiceps" and "P. sternbergi"); all three of them forming the family Pteranodontidae, which is found as the sister taxon of the family Nyctosauridae.
In 2020, a wing from the same deposit was assigned to the genus, however, the morphology suggested that "Tethydraco" was an azhdarchid, rather than a pteranodontid as originally proposed. A later analysis found it to be a pteranodontid again, however.
Paleoecology.
"Tethydraco" was discovered in the Ouled Abdoun Basin in Morocco. This basin is divided into layers called "Couches", and "Tethydraco" was discovered in Couche III. It coexisted with the pterosaurs "Alcione", "Barbaridactylus", "Simurghia" and "Phosphatodraco" and the abelisaurid dinosaur "Chenanisaurus".

Arthur John Balliol Salmon (1868 – 1953) was a British artist particularly noted for his illustrations and his work in pencil, chalk and pastels. He was one of the twenty leading illustrators selected by Percy V. Bradshaw for inclusion in his "Art of the Illustrator".
Biography.
Salmon was born in Manchester, Lancashire, England on 1 June 1868. He was the son of Henry Curwen Salmon and Ellen Fennell, who had married on 6 May 1857. 
Balliol Salmon studied for a year under Fred Brown at the Westminster School, where his fellow pupils were F. H. Townsend and Fred Pegram. Salmon continued his training, together with Fred Pegram at Paris ateliers. He trained at the Academie Julian in Paris. He lived in Glasgow and London.
He pursued a career as teacher and illustrator, notably for The Graphic. Houfe wrote in his "Dictionary of Nineteenth-Century British Book Illustrators and Caricaturists" (1996) that Balliol Salmon was one of the best pencil and chalk artists to work for the press in the Edwardian era.
Balliol Salmon was chosen by art instructor Percy V. Bradshaw as one of the artists to illustrate "The Art of the Illustrator", the seminal collection of twenty portfolios demonstrating six stages of a single painting or drawing by twenty different artists and published in 1918. 
Book illustrations for the series of books by Angela Brazil.
Salmon was Angela Brazil's favourite among her illustrators with his "lovely elongated schoolgirls". He illustrated seven of her books in the UK. Different illustrators were used for different markets. Freeman states that Salmon's illustrations were jettisoned for comic cartoons in France and winsomeness in America.
In the following list PG indicates whether the book is available on Project Guthenberg. The list is based on searches on Jisc library hub discover, checked against the bibliography in Sims and Clare's "Encyclopedia of Girls' School Stories".

Markov odometer

In mathematics, a Markov odometer is a certain type of topological dynamical system. It plays a fundamental role in ergodic theory and especially in orbit theory of dynamical systems, since a theorem of H. Dye asserts that every ergodic nonsingular transformation is orbit-equivalent to a Markov odometer.
The basic example of such system is the "nonsingular odometer", which is an additive topological group defined on the product space of discrete spaces, induced by addition defined as formula_1, where formula_2. This group can be endowed with the structure of a dynamical system; the result is a conservative dynamical system.
The general form, which is called "Markov odometer", can be constructed through Bratteli–Vershik diagram to define "Bratteli–Vershik compactum" space together with a corresponding transformation.
Nonsingular odometers.
Several kinds of non-singular odometers may be defined. 
These are sometimes referred to as adding machines.
The simplest is illustrated with the Bernoulli process. This is the set of all infinite strings in two symbols, here denoted by formula_3 endowed with the product topology. This definition extends naturally to a more general odometer defined on the product space
for some sequence of integers formula_5 with each formula_6
The odometer for formula_7 for all formula_8 is termed the dyadic odometer, the von Neumann–Kakutani adding machine or the dyadic adding machine.
The topological entropy of every adding machine is zero. Any continuous map of an interval with a topological entropy of zero is topologically conjugate to an adding machine, when restricted to its action on the topologically invariant transitive set, with periodic orbits removed.
Dyadic odometer.
The set of all infinite strings in strings in two symbols formula_3 has a natural topology, the product topology, generated by the cylinder sets. The product topology extends to a Borel sigma-algebra; let formula_10 denote that algebra. Individual points formula_11 are denoted as formula_12
The Bernoulli process is conventionally endowed with a collection of measures, the Bernnoulli measures, given by formula_13 and formula_14, for some &lt;math&gt;0 independent of formula_8. The value of formula_16 is rather special; it corresponds to the special case of the Haar measure, when formula_17 is viewed as a compact Abelian group. Note that the Bernoulli measure is "not" the same as the 2-adic measure on the dyadic integers! Formally, one can observe that formula_17 is also the base space for the dyadic integers; however, the dyadic integers are endowed with a metric, the p-adic metric, which induces a metric topology distinct from the product topology used here.
The space formula_17 can be endowed with addition, defined as coordinate addition, with a carry bit. That is, for each coordinate, let
formula_20
where formula_21 and
inductively. Increment-by-one is then called the (dyadic) odometer. It is the transformation formula_23 given by formula_24, where formula_2. It is called the "odometer" due to how it looks when it "rolls over": formula_26 is the transformation formula_27. Note that formula_28 and that formula_26 is formula_10-measurable, that is, formula_31 for all formula_32
The transformation formula_26 is non-singular for every formula_34. Recall that a measurable transformation formula_35 is non-singular when, given formula_36, one has that formula_37 if and only if formula_38. In this case, one finds
where formula_40. Hence formula_26 is nonsingular with respect to formula_34. 
The transformation formula_26 is ergodic. This follows because, for every formula_44 and natural number formula_8, the orbit of formula_46 under formula_47 is the set formula_48. This in turn implies that formula_26 is conservative, since every invertible ergodic nonsingular transformation in a nonatomic space is conservative.
Note that for the special case of formula_16, that formula_51 is a measure-preserving dynamical system.
Integer odometers.
The same construction enables to define such a system for every product of discrete spaces. In general, one writes
for formula_53 with formula_54 an integer. The product topology extends naturally to the product Borel sigma-algebra formula_10 on formula_17. A product measure on formula_10 is conventionally defined as formula_58 given some measure formula_59 on formula_60. The corresponding map is defined by 
where formula_62 is the smallest index for which formula_63. This is again a topological group.
A special case of this is the "Ornstein odometer", which is defined on the space 
with the measure a product of
Sandpile model.
A concept closely related to the conservative odometer is that of the abelian sandpile model. This model replaces the directed linear sequence of finite groups constructed above by an undirected graph formula_66 of vertexes and edges. At each vertex formula_67 one places a finite group formula_68 with formula_69 the degree of the vertex formula_70. Transition functions are defined by the graph Laplacian. That is, one can increment any given vertex by one; when incrementing the largest group element (so that it increments back down to zero), each of the neighboring vertexes are incremented by one.
Sandpile models differ from the above definition of a conservative odometer in three different ways. First, in general, there is no unique vertex singled out as the starting vertex, whereas in the above, the first vertex is the starting vertex; it is the one that is incremented by the transition function. Next, the sandpile models in general use undirected edges, so that the wrapping of the odometer redistributes in all directions. A third difference is that sandpile models are usually not taken on an infinite graph, and that rather, there is one special vertex singled out, the "sink", which absorbs all increments and never wraps. The sink is equivalent to cutting away the infinite parts of an infinite graph, and replacing them by the sink; alternately, as ignoring all changes past that termination point. 
Markov odometer.
Let formula_71 be an ordered Bratteli–Vershik diagram, consists on a set of vertices of the form formula_72 (disjoint union) where formula_73 is a singleton and on a set of edges formula_74 (disjoint union).
The diagram includes source surjection-mappings formula_75 and range surjection-mappings formula_76. We assume that formula_77 are comparable if and only if formula_78.
For such diagram we look at the product space formula_79 equipped with the product topology. Define "Bratteli–Vershik compactum" to be the subspace of infinite paths,
Assume there exists only one infinite path formula_81 for which each formula_82 is maximal and similarly one infinite path formula_83. Define the "Bratteli-Vershik map" formula_84 by formula_85 and, for any formula_86 define formula_87, where formula_62 is the first index for which formula_89 is not maximal and accordingly let formula_90 be the unique path for which formula_91 are all maximal and formula_92 is the successor of formula_89. Then formula_94 is homeomorphism of formula_95.
Let formula_96 be a sequence of stochastic matrices formula_97 such that formula_98 if and only if formula_99. Define "Markov measure" on the cylinders of formula_95 by formula_101. Then the system formula_102 is called a "Markov odometer".
One can show that the nonsingular odometer is a Markov odometer where all the formula_103 are singletons.

Privatization in Azerbaijan

"Privatization in Azerbaijan" is the process of transferring the number of state properties to private property, through the law adopted by the Republic of Azerbaijan.
History.
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the people of Azerbaijan gained independence, the government undertook economic reforms aimed at the application of market mechanisms in the economy. First of all, the state control over the prices was abolished and the liberalization of the economy began. In 1992, 80% of the prices were liberalized in Azerbaijan.
The first state body which is responsible for the privatization of the state property was established in 1992 and the law "On privatization of state property" was adopted in 1993 in Azerbaijan.
The privatization of the housing Fund.
Before the collapse of the Soviet Union, property privatization was not allowed. According to article 1 of the “About privatization of housing stock in the Azerbaijan Republic”, dated 26 January 1993: “Citizens of the Azerbaijan Republic, and also the stateless persons which signed the contract on hiring of premises with the owner of the state or public housing stock have the right to gratuitously transfer the premises (houses) occupied by them to personal property under the terms and according to the procedure, the established this Law.” 
Stages.
The privatization process in Azerbaijan can be divided into three stages in the formulation and implementation of the legislative basis:
Pre-privatization preparation.
Preparatory stage characterizes the period up to 1996 and is called initial privatization. At this stage, along with establishment of the conceptual foundations for privatization, this process has been tested practically in the direction of privatization of taxi and buses and commercialization of the trade network. Main discussions on conceptual issues were carried out in government and parliament. As a result of these discussions, the law on State Property Privatization and the First State Program were adopted during the preparatory phase and the foundations of the legal basis of this process were established.
The first stage.
The first stage describes the implementation of the State Program on Privatization of State Property in Azerbaijan during 1995-1998. At this stage, the establishment of a normative legal base of privatization and the forming process of its complex legal base has been completed. This period is characterized by the rapid privatization of small enterprises and the corporation of medium and large enterprises. Free distribution of privatization shares to all citizens of the country born before January 1, 1996, also took place during this period.
The second stage.
The second stage has been continuing since 1999. During this period, the pace of privatization has decreased and interruptions have been observed during this period. During the period, a new legal basis of privatization was created and subsequent processes were regulated in accordance with the new Law on State Property Privatization and the provisions of the Second State Program. The changes in the arrangement and management of the organizational issues of the privatization process have coincided with this period and as a result, the State Property Committee has become the Ministry. Later, it was abolished and the Ministry of Economic Development was established on its base and several other economically-oriented public institutions, and the authority to privatize state property was entrusted to the relevant department of the Ministry.
II State programme.
The "II state program of privatization of state property in the Republic of Azerbaijan" was adopted in 2001. The purpose of this program was [6]:
Report.
According to the State Statistical Committee (SSC) 01.01.2001, 1169 state-owned enterprises with a charter capital of 2445.9 billion manat, including 117 state-owned enterprises with a total charter capital of 543.3 billion manat in the industry, 321 enterprises with a charter capital of 1082.9 billion manat in the agrarian sector, 140 enterprises with a charter capital of 155.0 billion manat in transport section, 135 state-owned enterprises with a charter capital of 157.6 billion manat in the construction section and other enterprises have been transformed into joint-stock companies.

Yaroslav Halan

Yaroslav Olexandrovych Halan (in Ukrainian: "Ярослав Олександрович Галан", party nickname "Comrade Yaga"; 27 July 1902 – 24 October 1949) was a Ukrainian Soviet anti-fascist writer, playwright, publicist, member of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine since 1924, killed by nationalist insurgents in 1949.
Biography.
Early life.
Yaroslav Halan was born on 27 July 1902 in Dynów to the family of Olexandr Halan, a minor post-office official. As a child he lived and studied in Przemyśl. He enjoyed a large collection of books gathered by his father, and was greatly influenced by the creativity of the Ukrainian socialist writer Ivan Franko. At school, Yaroslav's critical thoughts brought him into conflict with priests who taught theology.
At the beginning of the First World War his father, along with other "unreliable" elements who sympathized with the Russians, was placed in the Thalerhof internment camp by the Austrian authorities. Eventually Galitzia was taken by the Russians.
During the next Austrian offensive, in order to avoid repressions, his mother evacuated the family with the retreating Russian army to Rostov-on-Don, where Yaroslav studied at the gymnasium and performed in the local theatre. Living there, Halan witnessed the events of the October Revolution. He became familiar with Lenin’s agitation. Later these events formed the base of his story "Unforgettable Days".
While in Rostov-on-Don, he discovered the works of Russian writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, Vissarion Belinsky, and Anton Chekhov. Halan often went to the theatre. Thus his obsession with this art was born, which in the future determined his decision to become a playwright.
Student years.
After the war Halan returned to Galitzia (annexed by Poland), where in 1922 he graduated from the Peremyshl Ukrainian Gymnasium. He then studied at the Triest Higher Trade School in Italy, and in 1922 enrolled in the University of Vienna. In 1926 he transferred to the Jagiellonian University of Kraków, from which he graduated in 1928 (according to some sources he didn't pass the final exams). Halan then began working as a teacher of the Polish language and literature at a private gymnasium in Lutsk. However, ten months later he was banned from teaching due to political concerns.
In his student years Halan became active in left-wing politics. While at the University of Vienna he became a member of the workers' community "Einheit" ("Unity"), overseen by the Communist Party of Austria. From 1924 he proactively participated in the underground national liberation movement, which in the Ukrainian lands of the Second Polish Republic (except of Glitzia being under OUN influence) was headed by the Communist Party of Western Ukraine (CPWU). He joined the CPWU when he was on vacation in Peremyshl. Later, while studying in Kraków, he was elected a deputy chairman of the legal student organization "Życie" ("Life") ruled by the Communist Party of Poland.
Creativity and political struggle in Poland.
In the 1920s, Halan's creative activity also began. In 1927 he finished work on his first significant play, "Don Quixote from Ettenheim". For the first time he revealed the venality of nationalistic and chauvinistic parties in his play "99%" (1930). The theme of class struggle and condemning segregation were actualized in the plays "Cargo" (1930) and "Cell" (1932), calling for united actions and class solidarity of Ukrainian, Jewish and Polish proletarians.
Halan's play "99%" was staged by the semi-legal "Lviv Workers’ Theatre". On the eve of the premiere, Polish authorities launched a campaign of mass arrest against Western Ukrainian communists, sending them to the Lutsk prison. As the theatre's director and one of the key actors were arrested, the premiere was on the verge of failure. Despite risks of being arrested, the workers continued rehearsing, so that the play was presented with a delay of only one day. About 600 workers attended the premiere; for them, it was a form of protest mobilization against repression and nationalism.
Halan was one of the founders of the Ukrainian proletarian writers’ group "Horno". From 1927 to 1932, along with other communist writers and members of the CPWU, he worked for the Lviv-based Ukrainian magazine "Vikna," being a member of its editorial board, until it was closed by government censors.
Living in the Polish-controlled city of Lviv, Halan frequently had to earn money by translating novels from German into Polish. In 1932 he moved to Nyzhniy Bereviz, the native village of his wife, located in the Carpathian mountains, close to Kolomyia, and kept working on his own plays, stories and articles there. In the village he spread communist agitation among peasants, creating cells of the International Red Aid and the Committee for Famine Relief. Without opportunities to find work, he lived in the countryside until June 1935, when he was summoned by the CPWU to return to Lviv.
Halan was denied Soviet citizenship in 1935.
In 1935, Halan traveled extensively around Prykarpattia, giving speeches to peasants. He became an experienced propagandist and agitator. Addressing the city workers, Halan explained to them the main points of Marxist theory. In particular, he held lectures on Friedrich Engels's "", and Karl Marx's "Wage Labour and Capital". Together with the young communist writer Olexa Havryliuk, Halan organized safe houses, wrote leaflets and proclamations, and transferred illegal literature to Lviv.
Throughout his political career the writer was repeatedly persecuted, and twice imprisoned (for the first time in 1934). He was one of the organizers of the Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress of Cultural Workers in May 1936. Halan also took part in a major political demonstration on 16 April 1936 in Lviv, in which the crowd was fired on by Polish police (in total, thirty workers were killed and two hundred injured). Halan devoted his story "Golden Arch" to the memory of fallen comrades.
Participation in the Anti-Fascist Congress forced him to escape from Lviv to Warsaw, where he eventually found work at the left-wing newspaper "Dziennik Popularny", edited by Wanda Wasilewska. In 1937, the newspaper was closed by the authorities, and on 8 April Halan was accused of illegal communist activism and sent to prison in Warsaw (later transferred to Lviv). Released in December 1937, Halan lived in Lviv under strict supervision by the police, and remained unemployed until 1939.
In 1937, his elder brother, a member of the CPWU, died in Lviv. After the Communist Party of Poland and the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, as its autonomous organization, were dissolved by the Comintern on trumped-up accusations of spying for Poland in 1938, Halan's first wife Anna Henyk (also a member of the CPWU), who was studying at the Kharkiv Medical Institute, USSR, was arrested by the NKVD and executed in the Great Purge.
In the Soviet Lviv.
After the USSR annexed Western Ukraine and Western Belarus in September 1939, Yaroslav Halan worked for the newspaper "Vilna Ukraina", directed the Maria Zankovetska Theatre, and wrote more than 100 pamphlets and articles on changes taking place in the reunified lands of Western Ukraine.
"«A group of writers such as Yaroslav Halan, Petro Kozlaniuk, Stepan Tudor and Olexa Havryliuk [...] treated the liberation of Western Ukraine [by the Red Army] as a logical conclusion of the policy of the Communist Party, which fought for the reunification of the Ukrainian people. In this, they actively helped the party in word and deed. In return, they have already had experience with Polish prisons and oppression from their fellow countrymen. Now [after it happened] they could breathe a sigh of relief. That is why their smiles were so sincere and celebratory.»"
Petro Panch, "Lviv, Kopernyka str., 42", Vitchyzna, 1960, issue No 2, 172
In November 1939 Halan went to Kharkiv to try to locate his vanished wife Anna Henyk. Together with the writer Yuri Smolych he came to the dormitory of the Medical Institute, and asked the porter for any information about her fate. The porter only gave him back a suitcase with Anna's belongings and said that she had been arrested by the NKVD, in response to which Halan burst into tears.
In June 1941, being a journalist of the newspaper "Vilna Ukraina," he took his first professional vacation, in Crimea, but didn't manage to rest for long, as on 22 June Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union.
War period.
When the war on the Eastern Front began, Halan arrived in Kharkiv and went to the military commissariat having a big desire to become a volunteer of the Red Army and to go to the frontline but was denied.
He was evacuated to Ufa. In September 1941, Alexander Fadeyev summoned him to Moscow for working at the Polish-language magazine "Nowe Horyzonty." In the days of the Battle for Moscow, on 17 October, he was evacuated to Kazan.
Later the writer arrived in Saratov, where he served as a radio host at the "Taras Shevchenko Radio Station". Then he was a special front-line correspondent of the newspaper "Sovietskaya Ukraina", and then "Radianska Ukraina".
"«The majority of his radio-comments have been born spontaneously. He listens to the enemy's radio shows, thinks for a while, then goes to the studio with an open microphone and without any preparations responds, expressing everything what he feels. That was a true radio-battle with all Hitler's propagandists starting from Goebbels, Dietrich, and others. The opportunity to fight like this – immediately, without paper [and censorship] – demonstrates a high confidence given to him by the Government and the Central Committee of the CPSU(b).»"
Volodymyr Beliayev, Literaturna Ukraina, 1962In 1943, in Moscow, he met his future second wife Maria Krotkova, who was an artist.
In October 1943, the publishing house "Moscovskiy Bolshevik" released the collection of 15 Halan's war stories "Front on Air". At the end of the year, Halan moved to the recently liberated Kharkov and worked there on the frontline radio station "Dnipro".
During and after the war he was sharply condemning the Ukrainian nationalists – banderivtsi, melnykivtsi, bulbivtsi – as accomplices of the Nazi occupiers.
Post-war times.
In 1946 Yaroslav Halan as a correspondent of the "Radianska Ukraina" newspaper represented the USSR at the Nuremberg trial of Nazi military criminals.
Yaroslav Halan wrote much about Ukrainian nationalists. In his story "What Has No Name" he described the OUN crimes:
"«Fourteen-years-old girl can’t calmly look at meat. She trembles if someone is going to cook cutlets in her presence. A few months ago, on Easter Night, armed people came to a peasant house in a village close to the town of Sarny, and stabbed its inhabitants with knives. The girl having the eyes widened of fear was looking at the agony of her parents. The girl with horror in her eyes was looking at the agony of her parents. One of the gangsters put a knife blade to the child’s neck, but at the last moment a new “idea” came to his mind: “Live in glory to Stepan Bandera! And to avoid you being starved to death we will leave you some food. Guys, slice pork for her!" The "guys" liked such a proposal. In a few minutes a mountain of meat made from the bleeding father and mother grew up in front of the horror-struck girl...»"
In Halan's tragedy "Under the Golden Eagle" (1947) the writer harshly criticizes the American occupation administration in Western Germany for its rude attempts to prevent Soviet soldiers interned in special camps to return to their homeland. In his play "Love at Dawn" (1949, published in 1951) he described the triumph of Socialism in the rural areas of Western Ukraine.
Often he was focused on counteracting the nationalistic propaganda. Nevertheless, Halan complained that these "Augean stables" were not his vocation but it had to be done by someone:
"«I understand: the asenisation work is a necessary and useful work, but why only me? Why should I be the only cesspool cleaner? The reader of our periodicals will involuntarily have the thought that there is only "maniac" Halan, who has clung to Ukrainian fascism like a drunk clings to the raft, [while] the vast majority of the writers ignore this issue. It isn't needed to be explained what further conclusions the reader will make from this.»"
From Halan's letter to his friend Yuri Smolych, on 2 January 1948.
In his last satirical pamphlets Yaroslav Halan criticized the nationalistic and clerical reaction (particularly, the Greek Catholic Church and the anti-Communist doctrine of the Holy See): "Their Face" (1948), "In the service of Satan" (1948), "In the Face of Facts" (1949), "Father of Darkness and His Henchmen" (1949), "The Vatican Idols Thirst for Blood" (1949, in Polish), "Twilight of the Alien Gods" (1948), "What Should Not Be Forgotten" (1947), "The Vatican Without Mask" (1949) etc.
When the Vatican had discovered that Halan is going to publish his new anti-clerical pamphlet "Father of Darkness and His Henchmen", in July 1949 the Pope Pius XII excommunicated him. In response to this, Halan wrote a pamphlet "I Spit on the Pope", that caused a significant resonance within the Church and among believers. In the pamphlet he ironized on the "Decree against Communism" released by the Vatican on 1 July, in which the Holy See had threatened to excommunicate all members of the Communist parties and active supporters of the Communists:
"«My only consolation is that I am not alone: together with me, the Pope excommunicated at least three hundred million people, and with them I once again in full voice declare: I spit on the Pope!»"
Assassination.
Yaroslav Halan was assassinated on 24 October 1949 in his home office, which was situated at Hvadiyska street in Lviv. He received eleven blows to the head with an axe. His blood spilled on the manuscript of his new article, "Greatness of the Liberated Human", which celebrated the tenth anniversary of the annexation of Western Ukraine with the Ukrainian SSR.
The killers – two students of the Lviv Forestry Technical Institute, Ilariy Lukashevych and Mykhailo Stakhur – committed the assassination after receiving the appropriate order from the OUN leadership. On the eve of the murder Lukashevych gained the writer's confidence, so the students were let into the house. They came to the apartment under the pretext of being discriminated against at the university and seeking his help. When Lukashevych gave a signal, Stakhur attacked the writer with the axe. After Stakhur was convinced that Halan was dead, they tied up the housekeeper and escaped.
The Ministry of the State Security (MGB) accused the Ukrainian nationalists of his murder, while the OUN claimed that it was a Soviet provocation in order to start a new wave of repressions against locals.
Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Ukrainian SSR at that time, took personal control of the investigation. In 1951, the MGB agent Bohdan Stashynsky infiltrated into the OUN underground network and managed to find Stakhur, who himself bragged about the assassination of Halan. He was arrested on 10 July, and afterwards fully admitted his responsibility for the crime during the trial. According to Stakhur, he did that because of the writer's critical statements on the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Ukrainian Insurgent Army and the Vatican.
On 16 October 1951 the military tribunal of the Carpathian Military District sentenced Mykhailo Stakhur to death by hanging: the court hall applauded the announcement of the verdict. The verdict was enforced on the same day.
Some contemporary Ukrainian historians and journalists put forward the hypothesis that Halan was killed by the Soviets. However, nowadays the fact of the OUN guilt proved with the numerous pieces of evidence is widely recognized by the vast majority of historians.
The assassination of Halan caused tightening of measures against the nationalist Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), which continued insurgent activities against the Soviet power in Western Ukraine. All the leadership of the MGB arrived in Lviv, Pavel Sudoplatov himself worked there for several months. One of the consequences of the murder of Halan was the elimination of the UPA leader Roman Shukhevych four months later.
Evaluations by contemporaries.
"«Yaroslav Halan is a talented publicist, was a progressive writer in the past. Nowadays he still is the most advanced one among [local] non-party writers. But he's infected with the Western European bourgeois "spirit". Has little respect for Soviet people. Considers them not civilized enough. But just inwardly. In general terms, he understands the policy of the party, but in his opinion, the party makes great mistakes with regards to peasants in Western Ukraine. Halan places responsibility for these mistakes on the regional committee of the CPSU(b), local institutions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the local Soviet authorities. Believes in Moscow. Doesn't want to join the party (he was advised to) due to being an individualist, and also in order to keep his hands, mind, and words free. He thinks if he joins the party, he will lose this [freedom].»"
Extract from the report of the literary critic G. Parkhomenko to the Central Committee of the Communist Party (Bolshevik) of Ukraine, 15 December 1947.
In 1962, in Toronto, Olexandr Matla, aka Petro Tereschuk, a pro-nationalist historian from the Ukrainian diaspora in Canada, published the brochure "History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan)", in which he accused Halan of being an informer of both Polish and Soviet intelligence services, and of helping them to oppress nationalists and even some pro-Soviet writers from Western Ukraine such as Anton Krushelnytsky, who moved from Lviv to Kharkiv in the 1930s and was killed during the Great Terror.
"«[Halan] has used his undeniable publicistic talent to serve the enemy, thereby placing himself outside the Ukrainian people. He has directed his energy and creative mind against his own people and their interests. An outrageous egoist, egocentrist, money lover, slanderer, cynic, provocator, agent of two intelligence services, misanthrope, falsificator, speculator, and an informer are all the characteristics of Yaroslav Halan.»"
Petro Tereschuk, History of a Traitor (Yaroslav Halan), Canadian League for Ukraine's Liberation, Toronto, 1962.
"«Yaroslav is an erudite, artist, polemicist, politician and undoubtedly an international-level journalist. I was amazed at his knowledge of the languages: German, French, Italian, Polish, Jewish, Russian. Picking up any newspaper or document he leafs through, reads it and writes something down. I was also surprised by his efficiency in work, interest in everything, an exceptional ability to "seek" and "raise" topics, problems, his persistent work on processing the material.»"
Yuri Yanovsky, a Ukrainian Soviet writer, who worked with Halan at the Nuremberg Trial in 1946.
"«In 1949 I witnessed an unusual event. On October 2 Yaroslav Halan spoke in Lviv University. It turned out to be his last speech. We condemned him but his presentation surprised me. He spoke as an intelligent person defending Ukrainian culture. It had nothing to do with the series of his pamphlets “I spit on Pope!” Halan turned out to be a totally different man. Several days later he was killed.»"

Aldington George Curphey

Colonel Sir Aldington George Curphey, CBE, MC (24 August 1880 – 28 November 1958) was an Anglo-Jamaican surgeon, medical officer and politician who served as President of the island's Legislative Council from 1952 to 1958.
Early life and family.
Aldington George Curphey was born on 24 August 1880 in the St Andrew parish of Kingston, Jamaica, to Thomas John Curphey and his wife Georgiana, "née" Cowell. His father had earlier emigrated from his native Isle of Man to become a chemist; Curphey's mother was the daughter of an English police officer.
Career.
Medicine.
After attending York Castle High School and Wolmer's School, Curphey went to Queen's University, Canada, graduating with his medicine degrees (MD, CM) in 1907, and qualifying as a Licentiate of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh (LRCP Ed), the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (LRCS Ed) and the Royal Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons (LRFPS) in 1909. He was held a number of posts at Saint Joseph's Hospital in Hamilton, Ontario, and was coroner for Wentworth County, but in 1912 he entered the Jamaica Medical Service to become Medical Officer for Health for Saint Ann Parish; he also began work at Spanish Town Hospital and Lepers' Home. He remained a Government Medical Officer on the island until 1936. In the meantime, Curphey served in the First World War as a medical officer attached to the Jamaica War Contingent; he was commissioned into the Royal Army Medical Corps as a captain, and won the Military Cross. On demobilisation, Curphey set up his own medical practice in Saint Ann. At the onset of the Second World War, Curphey became a Senior Military Medical Officer for Jamaica and took the rank of Surgeon-Major in the Local Forces (he was later made an Honorary Colonel); from 1944 to 1949 was also Welfare Officer for the Caribbean Area.
Public service.
Curphey's entry into public service began in 1936 when he was elected to Saint Ann's Parish Board. The following year, he became its Vice-Chairman and in 1944 Chairman. In 1945, he became a member of the Jamaican Legislative Council. In 1952, he was elected President of the Legislative Council, and served in the office until his death. He had been President of the Jamaica branch of the British Medical Association in 1937 and had held a range of other public and philanthropic offices. He was one of the island's representatives at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in London in 1953.
 Curphey was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 1944 and promoted to Commander (CBE) in 1952; he was knighted six years later. He died on 28 November 1958, leaving behind his widow, Winifred May "née" Douët, and their daughter.

First Day Hikes

First Day Hikes is a program of free, guided hikes offered by the fifty state park systems of the United States each year on New Year's Day. The program began locally in Massachusetts in 1992 and then went nationwide in 2012 under the aegis of the America's State Parks alliance. 
The hikes are intended to promote an alternate way of celebrating the new year by going outside, getting some exercise, and experiencing local nature and history. In 2017, for instance, more than 62,000 people participated in First Day Hikes, covering over on some 1,300 hikes around the nation. 
Hikes.
The number of different hikes offered within each state varies, with for example in 2018 New Jersey listing 30, Oklahoma having 19, and California offering over 80 of them.
Hikes vary widely in duration and difficulty, with many being in length, easy-to-moderate in difficulty, and starting between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. and taking one to two hours to complete. However some are very short and easy and are family-friendly for all ages, while others are strenuous with significant elevation gains. Still others, such as at Spruce Run Recreation Area in New Jersey or at Red Rock Canyon State Park in California, are all-day affairs. 
Walks often stop to hear the guides describe local flora, fauna, or historical sites of interest, such as at Monmouth Battlefield State Park in New Jersey. In some locations, park officials offer hot drinks and treats after the hikes. The number of participants on any given hike can range from a dozen to a hundred or more; some hikes even draw two or three hundred people, and in any case numbers often vary depending upon the weather.
In some cases, such as at Spring Mountain Ranch State Park in Nevada, guides may take participants into areas of a park normally off-limits to the general public.
A few hikes feature modes other than walking, such as horseback riding, mountain biking, or all-terrain vehicles. Night hikes have even been held when there is an especially bright moon.
Cold weather is usually expected on January 1 across much of the nation and participants are advised to dress in layers appropriately. In cases of severe winter weather some of the hikes in a state may be cancelled, while others go on.
People do turn out even in very cold weather, with for instance over 1,000 participants across Indiana in 2018 despite an average high temperature in the state that day of .
History.
The tradition began on January 1, 1992, at the Blue Hills Reservation state park in Norfolk County, Massachusetts outside of Boston.
It was the idea of Patrick Flynn, supervisor of Blue Hills Reservation, who had remembered a February winter hike taking place in his home state of Ohio.
The New Years Day hike at Blue Hills drew 380 people that first year, and has since become so popular at that site that the parking lots become full and people must stop their cars along nearby roadsides.
The start of 2018 marked the 27th annual First Day Hike at Blue Hills Reservation.
For his contribution, Flynn subsequently received an award from the National Association of State Park Directors; as one Massachusetts state official said at the ceremony, "One person having one idea can really spark a revolution."
Breakheart Reservation in Massachusetts was another park that started the practice early on.
Then in 2008, hikes were added at other sites in Massachusetts under the sponsorship of the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation.
The hikes continued to grow in popularity in that state.
Independently, another first day walk tradition began on January 1, 1970, in Assateague State Park on the Maryland Eastern Shore. It was started by two women who sought to celebrate the beauty of Assateague Island and rally against plans to develop it. It subsequently became an annual tradition, with the 30th iteration taking place in 2010, and became very popular over time, with people driving from various other parts of the state to join in with up to 300 others. The Ilia Fehrer / Judy Johnson Memorial Beach Walk, named after the two women who started it, is now part of Maryland's roster of First Day Hikes.
During 2011, Priscilla Geigis, the director of state parks in the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, suggested that other state park directors in nearby states adopt the practice. The idea quickly spread and by the end of the year, state park directors across the country had become involved. Thus, First Day Hikes became a nationwide event on January 1, 2012, under the America's State Parks association, with some 400 hikes being offered. The practice has continued to grow in popularity since then. In 2016, about 55,000 participants were involved in the hikes nationwide.
with that number exceeding 62,000 in 2017 with some 1,300 hikes being given.
The effects of the 2017–18 North American cold wave, which gave frigid temperatures across much of the nation, resulted in numbers for 2018 decreasing to 32,000 participants across some 1,200 hikes.
The numbers rebounded in 2019 with 55,000 people engaging in hikes that totally some 133,000 miles walked. The start of a new decade on January 1, 2020 saw almost 85,000 people hiking a total of over 175,000 miles. 
The COVID-19 pandemic in the United States had an impact on First Day Hikes as it did almost everything else. For the January 1, 2021 hikes, some states such as New Jersey and Minnesota cancelled them altogether, with perhaps suggestions for what could be undertaken on one's own; some states such as Connecticut and Arkansas offered self-guided hikes, with provisions to share experiences virtually afterward or gain participation badges; and some states such as New York and West Virginia went forward with guided hikes, but on a smaller scale and with social distancing related measures in place.
Purpose.
The America's State Parks association proclaims, "What better way to kick off the New Year than by getting a jump start burning off those extra holiday calories in the great outdoors?" (The association emphasized that idea one year by saying that the hikes burned off the equivalent of over 41,000 fast-food hamburgers.) Or as New Jersey's park system says about the activity, "These free First Day Hikes offer a great incentive to get outside, exercise, experience history, enjoy nature, and celebrate the New Year with friends and family in one of your state parks."
As one state parks official in Massachusetts itself said, "We want to launch the year saying, 'Get outside!'"
Some people engage in First Day Hikes to counteract the effects of New Year's Eve celebrations the night before, while others find the outdoor activity the best aspect of the whole holiday. 
Another parks official in Iowa said, "We started this as a health initiative, but it's really just grown into a good way to spend time with the family and do something that you maybe normally wouldn't do on that holiday."

Adrian Chmielarz

Adrian Chmielarz (born 1971 in Lubin) is a Polish video game designer, programmer, creative director, producer and writer specializing in adventure games and first-person shooters. Chmielarz has co-founded and led Metropolis Software, People Can Fly and The Astronauts. He is one of the most famous Polish video gaming figures, as well as one of the most divisive figures in the industry.
Life and career.
Piracy business and amateur game development.
Born in Lublin on April 9, 1971, Adrian Chmielarz moved into game development in a roundabout way. In 1985, at the age of 15, Chmielarz attended the first Polcon science fiction convention in Błażejewko, where he first discovered an affinity for computers. He soon went through a "Star Wars" fan phase that saw him interact with a computer for the first time. By the late 1980s, he had become fascinated with computer games such as "Knight Lore" and "Bugsy" by reading about them in "Przegląd Techniczny". He began saving for a ZX Spectrum despite never having used one before. His first experience playing games would see him typing in each line of code from gaming magazines into his friend's computer, though each time he turned off the computer the games were wiped as there was no way to save them. Chmielarz was pushed by a desire to buy a computer with his own money, knowing that his parents had been forced into the black market to "put food on the table".
In 1987, Chmielarz earned financial sustainability by traveling 40 miles each day to sell bootleg foreign films on VHS tapes, copied from a friend at a bazaar in Wrocław (such type of copyright infringement was not illegal in Poland until 1994). The Wrocław marketplace where such goods were sold often had access to newer titles earlier. He noted that while an Englishman could buy a game the day of release, the average Pole would often have to wait up to five weeks and become impatient during that time, leading to this natural solution. According to Chmielarz "many people would buy games, if only it would be possible." At one point, Chmielarz set up a distribution deal with the to-be-founders of what would become Polish distribution company CD Projekt, whereby they would drop cassette tapes full of pirated games at a local train station. After picking them up, to get an advantage over his competitors at the bazaar, he would add subroutines to alter gameplay (such as changing the number of lives or adding invulnerability); he would also himself crack the games and then apply his own anti-piracy protection measures to prevent other pirates from copying and selling it. Eventually, his bootleg business expanded into a brick-and-mortar company which sold different types of media, including movies and games, while also building computers to feed the local business industry. However, large companies started to enter Poland and the market became crowded. While he had a computer engineering company, the times were getting tougher and only giants with big money could survive on the market. Chmielarz decided to leave his profitable business and study at Wrocław University of Technology. However, he became bored and left without finishing his degree; he would later regret wasting his time at college.
By 1990, Chmielarz had his own computers and his obsession led to him playing and making games all the free time. He sent the results of his experiments with creating video games the editorial offices of the magazines "Komputer" and "Bajtek", winning a subscription to the latter as a result. One of these early titles was an erotic game "Erotic Fun" that sold well without any long-term profit; he later deemed this a good business lesson about exploiting an opportunity in the gaming market. Some of his other early games included text adventure games "Kosmolot Podróżnik" and "Sekretny Dziennik Adriana Mole", which he wrote on the Timex Computer 2048.
Professional game development.
In 1992, Adrian Chmielarz and Grzegorz Miechowski co-founded video game developing and publishing company Metropolis Software. The group realised that they could fill a gap in the untapped Polish software market, in which hundreds of thousands of people owned computers but were unable to become fully immersed in adventure games as they did not understand English. Chmielarz was not worried about the Polish gaming market being a small niche, as he knew the trail had already been set by developer xLand. Furthermore, he had assessed that while the local market was currently not active it was potentially big, noting the number of people who attended conventions. This project evolved into Chmielarz's first commercially released video game, the 1993 point-and-click adventure "Tajemnica Statuetki". Some of Chmielarz's next projects, such as another point-and-click adventure game "Teenagent" (1995), scrolling shooter "Katharsis" (1997), and tactical role-playing game "Gorky 17" (1999, known as "Odium" in North America), have been published also outside Poland. Due to an internal conflict, Chmielarz left Metropolis in 1999.
Founding the video game development studio People Can Fly in 2002, he went on to create the successful first-person shooter "Painkiller" (2004) and its follow-ups ' (2004), ' (2006), and ' (2012). A partnership with Epic Games and the work on the "Gears of War" series of third-person shooters, in which he personally went from a multiplayer level designer for the first two games to being the original creative director of ' (2013), led to Epic acquiring People Can Fly in 2007 and the creation of their next first-person shooter, "Bulletstorm" (2011).
After leaving People Can Fly (by then fully owned by Epic) in 2012, Chmielarz formed the independent video game studio The Astronauts, which developed and published its debut game, the first-person adventure "The Vanishing of Ethan Carter" in 2014. His next game and a return to the first-person shooter genre, "Witchfire", is to be released "when it's done".
Chmielarz has also written commentary articles for Polish video game magazines, including his monthly columns "Gawędy bez fai" and "Gawędy po fai" in "Secret Service" and "NEO+". In English, he has written blogs at Gamasutra and Medium.

Berthe Kal

Berthe Dyck Kaleka called Kal (10 November 1913 – 25 April 2015) was a 20th-century French soprano and music educator.
Biography.
Born in Paris, Kal, daughter of Russian and Lithuanian immigrants, came to study music at the age of six, through piano and music theory. 
Endowed with a great vocal ease and absolute pitch, she naturally turned to singing, which she practiced first in choir, in the Chorale Populaire de Paris. 
It was only in 1948 that she took her first lessons, with Lise Daniels.
She then entered the Schola Cantorum de Paris to study harmony, counterpoint, and vocal technique with Irène Joachim later Jane Bathori.
From 1952, she was hired as soloist with the ORTF, to do most of her career there, participating in numerous musical programs ("Plaisirs de la musique" of Roland Manuel; "Livre d'or" on France Culture), concerts, and radio creations. She had the opportunity to perform under the direction of Pierre Boulez, Gilbert Amy, Charles Bruck, Pierre Capdevielle, Marius Constant, Bruno Maderna, Manuel Rosenthal, and Michel Plasson, among others.
Recommended by Jane Bathori, in 1957 she joined the "Société de musique d'autrefois" founded by Countess Geneviève Thibault de Chambure, for concerts under the direction of Yvonne Gouverné, until 1968.
From 1960 to 1965, she joined Vladimir Jankélévitch for a series of concerts-conferences in Paris, on musical romanticism in Russia, within the framework of the conferences "Connaissance de l'URSS" organised by the . These "Causerie(s)" were the opportunity for the philosopher to illustrate himself at the piano.
Kal met Nadia Boulanger in 1961, during a concert in Nice for Prince Rainier of Monaco, then took part, in 1964, in lessons of musical interpretation of Mozart's works in her apartment of the rue Ballu (9th arrondissement of Paris). The same year, Nadia Boulanger invited her to give two recitals of French melodies at the , then at the Fontainebleau Schools.
Known for her qualities as a reader, she was regularly asked by Manuel Rosenthal, then professor of conducting class at the Conservatoire de Paris, to participate from 1962 to 1968 in the Prix de Rome composition class, thus familiarizing herself with a great diversity of musical languages.
As Jesus Aguila points out, Berthe Kal is one of the few specialists of the contemporary repertoire of the 1960s; she belongs to the circle of singers such as Cathy Berberian, Helga Pilarczyk, Ethel Semser, Marie-Thérèse Cahn, who participate in the creations of the Domaine musical.
She also collaborated with composer Georges Delerue for film music, and made an appearance in "Promise at Dawn" (1970) by Jules Dassin.
Berthe Kal died in Paris at age 101.

Everybody Loves a Clown (album)

Everybody Loves a Clown is the third studio album by American band Gary Lewis &amp; the Playboys, and was released in 1965 on Liberty Records, LRP-3428. It is the third of three charting albums released by the band in 1965, and it was the band's third highest charting original album reaching number 44 on the Billboard 200. The single "Everybody Loves a Clown" was the band's fourth single in a row to chart on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching number 4 in November 1965.
Background.

First Church in Charlestown

First Church in Charlestown was founded in 1632 in the Charlestown neighborhood of Boston, MA and is one of the oldest churches in Boston and the state of Massachusetts. It is dually aligned with both the United Church of Christ and the Southern Baptist Convention, holding to a conservative view of the Bible and holding to the traditional Reformed view of theology. It is the last church to be pastored by John Harvard, a founder, benefactor, and namesake of Harvard University.
History.
1600s.
The church was founded in 1632 and held its services for a time in the Great House in the City Square and was later one of the six churches that led to the creation of Harvard University. Rev. John Harvard served as an assistant minister at the church until his death from tuberculosis, from 1637-1638. Rev. Increase Mather and his son Rev. Cotton Mather were close friends of the Shepherds of whom two of them, Thomas Sr. and Thomas Jr. became pastors of First Church. 
1700s.
During the Revolutionary War, the British Army burned down the historic first building of First Church. A second building was built and used until the merger with its daughter church in the 1800s
1800s.
In the 1800s the church merged with its daughter congregation and moved into their facility which is the one used today as the current home of the church which shares some of the same architecture design as the original building. At one point, the church launched daughter churches in Charlestown and Old South Church in Boston, MA
1900s.
The church was used during the bussing controversy as a safe haven for African-American students. Some of the front windows are still boarded up today as a result of rocks and bricks being thrown through them in violence that rocked the city.
2000s.
The church has been historically and still is a Congregational church; upon the installation of Rev. Erik Maloy in 2015, the church also became a member of the Southern Baptist Convention through its affiliation with the Baptist Convention of New England. The church is also a part of The Gospel Coalition and 9 Marks networks, as well as one of the cohort churches in Overseed, an organization dedicated to reviving historic New England churches, by returning them to a Gospel preaching view of theology. The church has been going through a number of updates on its interior to make the church more modern in appearance. The downstairs fellowship area was updated in 2017 to include themed lights and a projector screen for presentations, as well as new paint and wood flooring. The Sanctuary was recently painted, as well as two LED TVs and a screen for music and other needs of the church.
At its height in 1837, the church had 271 members, in 2015 it had just 15, and, as of 2018, boasts 45-60 members and attendees. The church is involved in a number of activities within the Charleston neighborhood, that has helped its reputation with the community and made it begin to thrive once more.
In 2017, the church began to livestream its Sunday morning services on its Facebook page.
Design.
The current structure's design is similar to the original wood building. A fire in the 1950s caused the interior of the church to go through an extensive redesign. The balconies that surrounded the sanctuary were taken down and parts of the lower floor were enclosed to create Sunday School class rooms. The pews are of the art deco design on the 1960s.

Nunatta Qitornai

Nunatta Qitornai (, ) is a separatist political party in Greenland advocating independence. It was founded in September 2017 by former Minister of Business, Labour, Trade and Foreign Affairs Vittus Qujaukitsoq, who had previously been in Siumut and who was subsequently elected in the 2018 Greenlandic parliamentary elections. In the 2021 elections the party lost its seat.
Background.
In April 2017 Vittus Qujaukitsoq was relieved from the Foreign Affairs portfolio in the Greenlandic government by Premier Kim Kielsen due to harsh criticism of the Danish handling and filed formal complaint to United Nations with demands of the environmental clean-up of former U.S. military installations across Greenland. He stepped down as Minister of Industry, Trade, Labour and Energy in May 2017. He subsequently challenged Kielsen for the chairmanship at Siumut's party conference in July 2017, and left the party after he lost the vote 19–48.
Vittus Qujaukitsoq advocates a speedy transition to Greenlandic independence, whereas Kim Kielsen and the majority in Siumut are in favour of a gradualist approach.
The party stood in the 2018 parliamentary elections with former Prime Minister Aleqa Hammond as one of its candidates, but only chairman Vittus Qujaukitsoq was elected.
In the 2021 election the party lost its only seat.
Policies.
Apart from the speedy establishment of a Greenlandic state the party advocates decentralization of the administration and the establishment of 17 municipalities based on the current population distribution.
Name.
Nunavta Qitornai (pre-1973 spelling) was the name of a patriotic and educational youth organisation founded in 1941 by the politician and poet Augo Lynge, who was a prominent advocate for close cooperation between Greenland and Denmark and the incorporation of Greenland into the Danish state; his grandchild has criticized the use of the name for a separatist party as disrespectful to the memory of Augo Lynge.

The Signal From Tölva

The Signal From Tölva is an open world first-person shooter game developed and published by Big Robot. It was released on April 10, 2017 for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Taking place in the far future, the player character is a hacker-for-hire who hijacks a surveyor robot to investigate the barren world of Tölva in search of a strange signal. The game contains walking simulator elements, with tactical engagements being broken up by large segments of slow-paced exploration.
The game received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its setting and concept art-inspired aesthetic, but criticized its slow walking speed and the simplicity of its gameplay.
Plot.
The player character is a mysterious hacker who was contacted by The Broker, who hired them to infiltrate The Surveyors, a faction of robots who are probing the planet Tölva. The player can remotely commandeer drones located on the planet's surface, but is opposed by two other robotic factions, the Zealots and Bandits, who will attack on sight.
Gameplay.
The game alternates between combat in a first-person shooter style and exploration while traversing the planet's surface in a robot chassis. Robots have access to laser-based weaponry in the form of assault rifles and beam rifles. They also have a defensive shield system, and an area-of-effect attack that can disrupt enemies or heal allies. The player gains the ability to reprogram other robots to assist them in battle.
During exploration segments, the player can use a scanner to search for hidden messages and upgrades. The game contains a day/night cycle.
Development.
The game's visual aesthetic was inspired by the concept art of Ian McQue, who also designed the robots featured in the game.
Reception.
"The Signal From Tölva" received mixed reviews, with an aggregate score of 69/100 on Metacritic.
Chris Schilling of PC Gamer rated the game 80/100, calling it a "lean, intelligent sci-fi shooter" with a "fascinating setting" and a "watchmaker's eye for detail". He criticized the fact that the game can be "unfair" due to the existence of friendly fire against allies and no way to defend and fortify bases from other factions. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell of Eurogamer called the game a "dark, frustrating work", praising the game's artistic style, story and sound, but criticized the "strong element of grinding", saying the game later becomes "tedious". Glenn Wigmore of IGN rated the game 6.5/10, calling its concept "promising" and its visuals and audio "awe-inspiring", but calling its movement speed "plodding" and the plot only "partially" compelling.

Salvador Montes de Oca

Salvador Montes de Oca (21 October 1895 – 10 September 1944) – in religious Bernardo – was a Venezuelan Roman Catholic prelate and novice from the Carthusians who served as the Bishop of Valencia from 1927 until his resignation in 1934. Montes had limited pastoral experience before being appointed as a bishop but had served for a period as a spiritual director and after his appointment was known for upholding traditional teachings. But his defense of tradition on marriage and divorce led to his expulsion from Venezuela on the charge of inciting "rebellion" to which he was forced to reside at Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago from late 1929 until late 1931. He later resigned from his see following an attack of peritonitis and moved to Lucca to enter the Carthusians as a novice. He and other monks were killed after a Nazi raid who alleged the monks were harboring their enemies.
The beatification process for Montes opened on 11 March 2017 in the latter's old diocese and he is now titled as a Servant of God.
Life.
Salvador Montes de Oca was born in Carora in Venezuela on 21 October 1895 as one of five sons to Andrés Montes de Oca Zubillaga and Rosario Montes de Oca Perera. He was baptized as Andrés Salvador María del Carmen Montes de Oca on 12 December 1895 in the church of San Juan Bautista in Carora with his uncle Julio Montes de Oca presiding.
He received his Confirmation from the diocesan bishop Liscano on 25 May 1901 and his First Communion later on 7 May 1905 from the priest Carlos Zubillaga.
He began his schooling in his hometown under the watch of his kinsman Lucio Montes de Oca. Montes studied for the ecclesial life in Barquisimeto. On 5 July 1914 he accompanied Bishop Aguedo Felipe Alvarado Liscano to Rome so Montes could continue his studies at the Pontifical Latin American Pontifical College at the time the bishop attended an "ad limina apostolorum" visit to the ailing Pope Pius X. Montes was made a subdeacon on 24 September 1921 and was elevated into the diaconate on 22 January 1922 (coinciding with the death of Pope Benedict XV). He was ordained to the priesthood on 14 May 1922 and said his first Mass in his hometown on 28 May before being appointed as Bishop Liscano's private aide. Montes later was appointed as the spiritual director for seminarians and then served as a chaplain at the Santuario della Paz.
He later became named as the Bishop of Valencia and he received his episcopal consecration on 23 October 1927 before he was enthroned in his new see the following 27 October.
The political strife he faced with the government of President Juan Bautista Pérez led to his exile on 11 October 1929. The reason for his exile was a document he released on 4 October 1929 and which was later published in the newspaper "La Religione" on the traditional teaching on marriage and divorce which he railed against. Montes set sail via boat to his exile at Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago where its archbishop John Pius Dowling welcomed him. But public backlash against his exile placed great pressure on the government who terminated his exile and sent word to him that he would be able to return to his diocese in 1931. Montes arrived in his homeland at the port of La Guairá on 10 October 1931 to resume his pastoral duties and on 18 March 1934 left for Rome to attend an "ad limina apostolorum" with Pope Pius XI. On 3 October 1934 he suffered a violent attack of peritonitis brought on from acute appendicitis which prompted an operation on 6 October. These health complications motivated his desire to resign from his see. Upon the resignation of his episcopal see he was granted the ceremonial role of a titular bishop but later resigned from that position upon his desire to enter the religious life. It was in the Tuscan region in the Italian kingdom that he lived with the Padri Sacramentini and even joined their ranks before deciding instead to enter the Carthusians at their convent in Lucca in 1943 and became a novice. His first novitiate with the Padri Sacramentini from 15 August 1935 led to his initial profession on 8 December 1936 and his perpetual profession on 8 December 1939. But the Carthusian charism caught his attention and he decided to leave his order to join them instead and entered on 5 September 1942 during World War II.
On 10 September 1944 he and other monks were gunned down after Nazi authorities raided their convent and had slain them on the accusation of having granted safe haven to Italian political opponents. His remains were thrown into a mass grave alongside the other monks slain with him. In 1947 a paramedic team under the direction of Doctor Mariotti located his remains which were later transferred to Montes's old diocese back in his native land after their arrival on 11 June 1947 in the La Guairá port. His remains are now interred in his old cathedral beneath the main altar. On 5 September 2001 the Italian President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi granted Montes and ten other monks slain in the 1944 attack the Gold Medal for Civil Merit.
Beatification process.
The beatification process for the late bishop had been of interest in his homeland since the 2000s and the formal application for the cause's introduction was lodged to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in 2015 who granted the request and allowed for the cause to open in his old diocese rather than in Lucca where he had been killed. The diocesan process was launched on 11 March 2017 and is ongoing; Montes has been titled as a Servant of God.
The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Silvia Mónica Correale.

Bellbrook, New South Wales

Bellbrook is a locality in the Kempsey Shire of New South Wales, Australia along the Macleay River. The mountain village is classified by the National Trust as a heritage village and is part of the Macleay Valley Coast.
Population.
Bellbrook had a population of 273 as of the . 
Etymology.
The town was laid out and gazetted as Bellbrook in 1892. Caroline McMaugh, wife of early settler John McMaugh, named the village. At that time, and still today, the distinctive call of bellbirds could be heard echoing through the dense scrub they inhabited along Nulla Nulla Creek.
In 1882 the name Bellbrook was first adopted as the official title for the original post office. A postal receiving office at Bellbrook opened on 16 January 1882, became a post office on 1 January 1884 and closed on 10 April 1987. The present day post office is located at Bellbrook Hotel.
Climate.
Located within the same post code as Crescent Head and Port Macquarie (considered one of the most livable towns in Australia), Bellbrook enjoys a humid, sub-tropical climate with hot, humid summers and cold winters with significant rainfall. Many locals utilise fireplaces during the colder months.
History.
Pre-History.
Bellbrook is on the traditional lands of the Thunghutti Aboriginal people, some of whom continue to live on the local Aboriginal reserve. 
Settlement.
It was first settled by Europeans in the mid-1830s, and there was "very active antagonism" between the Europeans and the Thunghutti, which slowed the development of the village.
A Aboriginal reserve was established at Bellbrook in 1885. It was initially an unsupervised reserve, but was later managed by the Aboriginal Protection Board. Residents "came under intense government surveillance" from the APB and had to sign in and out. Many of the residents worked on local pastoral stations, generally poorly paid.
The Bellbrook Hotel overlooks the Macleay River. Opening in 1913, the Bellbrook Hotel is of historical significance, enjoying over one hundred years of service in addition to its notoriety as the watering hole of renowned Country Music Singer Slim Dusty. In 2018 the pub was nominated for the Best Bush Pub category in the Australian Hotels Association 2018 awards for excellence. In the same year, Bellbrook Hotel featured as one of twenty-five historic pubs in a travel book by the publisher of Australian Bush Pubs, titled, "'Historic Pubs, New South Wales"'.
The Bellbrook General Store is located in Main Street, with the store and post office relocating to the Bellbrook Hotel in late 2019. It was the location of the Country Women's Association for many years in addition to catering for functions, meetings and local gatherings. The General Store is situated in the middle of the village, opposite the public school and Bellbrook Memorial Park. 
The Bellbrook School of Arts was built circa 1922 and is opposite the General Store, Bellbrook Memorial Park and tennis courts.
In 2005, the town's raw water supply was contaminated by heavy metals and arsenic from former mines in the Hillgrove area. In 2008, water was reportedly having to be trucked into the town because the supply was so contaminated. A new $700,000 water treatment plant was installed in 2009 to address the issue.
In November 2019, Bellbrook locals were forced to evacuate as their community was engulfed by the Carrai East fire which resulted in the loss of some homes. The Nulla Nulla Creek home of country music legend Slim Dusty was saved. Mobile phone coverage was lost in the mountain village with locals relying upon each other and the local Rural Fire Service for updates. Fires blocked the road to and from Bellbrook. Some locals stayed to prepare for the oncoming bushfire and created containment lines around their properties while other residents were forced to shelter at the local school. Locals were later able to leave under Emergency Service escort once the road was deemed safe.
In late November 2020, a travelling photograph exhibition titled, 'Black Summer and Beyond' was hosted at the Bellbrook School of Arts in commemoration of the bushfires. 
Culture.
Art.
Bellbrook's rich history and unique location has been the subject of many landscape artists, notably award-winning Kempsey born artist Les Graham and Stephen Franks (1942-2002).
The Bellbrook community embraces its Thunghutti Aboriginal roots. In December 2018 community members attended the official unveiling of its new sculpture “Wupu Manhatinum”- translation- "'Travelling Star"', which now resides in the local park. The public artwork was dedicated to the late Aboriginal elder and artist, Aunty Esther Quinlin. The sculpture is part of the Dunghutti Story Trail – the Dhanggati Wirriyn Yapang project, which celebrates the Macleay Valley Coast’s significant cultural heritage and ""-mark['s] the western gateway into Dunghutti country"."
Music.
Internationally renowned musician Slim Dusty was a Bellbrook local, growing up at Nulla Nulla Creek. Slim's 1957 song Pub with No Beer was based on the pub at nearby Taylor's Arm.
Vanlife Movement.
Due to Bellbrook's untouched hinterland and close proximity to surf beaches such as Crescent Head, it is an increasingly popular destination for nature enthusiasts, either as residents or campers.
The growing 'Vanlife' movement and the subject of the 2019 film documentary 'The Meaning of Vanlife' held their 2016 gathering in Bellbrook NSW. The trip began with a Thunghutti Welcome to Country ceremony followed by stories and local history shared by camp-fire. The visit was facilitated by The YARN initiative with Desert Pea Media showcasing three locally produced films. Sibling music duo VanderAa performed for the trip.
Activities.
Fishing.
Bellbrook and its surrounds are renowned for quality bass fishing. One of Australia's first bass lures was appropriately called the 'Bellbrook Wobbler'. A popular lodge up-river from the town of Bellbrook is called Bass Lodge and offers fishing stays.
Kayaking.
Many visitors bring kayaks or canoes to enjoy the Macleay river, paddling upstream, to then be carried back downstream while fishing or taking in the hinterland.
Trails.
There are walking and riding trails around Bellbrook and its reserves.
Camping.
Camping or leasing cottages in Bellbrook is a popular attraction particularly with 4WD holidaymakers due to its untouched hinterland and popular fishing grounds.
Notable People.
'Homewood', Bellbrook is the childhood home of country music star Slim Dusty. It is located at Nulla Nulla Creek.
Schools.
Bellbrook Public School.
Education in the district began in 1883 at Midnight Creek, located approximately three kilometres east of Bellbrook, opening initially as a provisional school. The school then moved to half-time with Pee Dee from 1887 to 1890, closed from 1890 to 1910, then re-opened half-time with Nulla Nulla from 1910 to 1911, and has been continually open since then. 
The first school on site was built in 1911. In 1930, the current Bellbrook School was built. Carcolla School was moved to Bellbrook school grounds in 1970 and is now the infants department.
A former boarding school, the Mirriwinni Gardens Aboriginal Academy, also operated at Bellbrook for more than thirty years. It educated more than 1500 children, but was forced to close in 2009 after running into financial difficulties. It is now the grounds for Misty Mountain Health Retreat.
As at 2017, Bellbrook Public School had an enrolment of 32 students.

Alessandria–Piacenza railway

The Alessandria–Piacenza railway is a railway located in northern Italy connecting the regions of Emilia-Romagna, Lombardy, and Piedmont. The railway is long and it is managed by RFI. It links the rail hub of Alessandria with that of Piacenza, passing through the cities of Tortona, Voghera, and Stradella.
History.
The works for the construction of the railway began on 16 January 1856: the initial project included the section between Alessandria and Stradella, as well as a branch from Tortona to Novi Ligure. In June 1858 a decree was approved by the Chamber for the "Facilitazione per l'unione della Società della ferrovia da Alessandria e Novi a Stradella con quella di Piacenza" (Facilitation of the union of the railway company from Alessandria and Novi to Stradella with that of Piacenza) In 1859, the territory of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza were incorporated into the United Provinces of Central Italy and subsequently annexed to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a result of the plebiscite of 12 March 1860. Following the annexation, the railway was extended to Piacenza.
The first section, between Alessandria and Casteggio was opened on 25 January 1858. The section was opened to Stradella in the following July, while the Piacenza sections of the line were opened between 1859 and 1860, the last of which, between the bridge over the Trebbia river and Piacenza, was opened to traffic on 19 January 1860.
Starting from 1 July 1905, under , the operation of the railway line was taken over by the Italian state, through the newly established "Azienda autonoma per l'esercizio delle Ferrovie Italiane" (Ferrovie dello Stato), under the control of the Ministry of Public Works.
A crash occurred at on the night of 31 May 1962, when a freight train from Milan hit the end of a passenger train that was stationary on platform 3 and about to leave for Genoa. 64 people lost their lives, and 40 were seriously injured, 4 of whom later died in hospital bringing the death toll to 64.
Characteristics.
The railway has a gauge of 1435 mm. It is electrified at 3000V, and it can bear a weight of 22.5 tons per axis.

Emerich Sinelli

Emerich Sinelli, O.F.M. Cap. (29 June 1622, Komorn – 25 February 1685, Vienna) was of the Capuchin Order and Prince-Bishop of Vienna.
Biography.
He was born the son of a butcher of the then Hungarian town of "Komárom", Michael Senelli, and baptized under the name Johann Anton. He studied first in Linz and then Philosophy in Ingolstadt, entered the Capuchin Order at age twenty-one and took the religious name Emerich. In 1644 he swore his eternal vows in the Capuchin monastery in Gmunden. Sinelli was the first missionary designated for the conversion of Protestants in Lower Austria, then in Prague and in the Viennese Schottenkirche. In his orations he denounced the grievances at court and the greed of the dignitaries and became an advisor to Emperor Leopold I. The expulsion of Jews from the Leopoldstadt in 1670 was carried out on his advisement.
On 17 November 1680, the Emperor appointed him Prince-Bishop of Vienna, but as a mendicant he was reluctant to accept this honor. Pope Innocent XI had to order Sinelli through an apostolic nuncio to accept his consecration, which took place on 4 May 1681 and was officiated by Nuncio Francesco Buonvisi. Sinelli was then made First Minister on the Imperial Privy Council in 1682, but continued to lead his characteristically modest life. In his episcopal functions he was represented by the Bishop of Wiener-Neustadt, Leopold Karl von Kollonitsch.
During his tenure came the Second Turkish Siege in 1683, in which Marco d'Aviano served as the Papal legate in Vienna. Sinelli at first fled the besieged city with the Imperial Court, but after an Imperial victory at the Battle of Kahlenberg, he returned to the city on 14 September with the Emperor and initiated the reconstruction of destroyed churches.
Sinelli died before receiving his elevation to cardinal, and is buried in the episcopal tomb of St. Stephen's Cathedral in Vienna.

Scomadi

Scomadi is a brand of British designed scooters, produced in Thailand.
History.
Beginnings.
Scomadi scooters started in 2005, founded by Frank Sanderson of Scooter Innovation Ltd and Paul Melici of PM Tuning Ltd. Scomadi Headquarters was based in Olympia House, London Road, Preston, Lancashire, England. The two founders, with 60 years of experience between them, put together 10 prototypes named Turismo Leggera (TL). These were sold quickly. They realised there was demand so a further 20 TL300 were produced and painted to customer specification.
Mass Production.
In November 2013 Scomadi launched its first production models the TL50 and TL125 at EICMA motorcycle show in Milan. In August 2014 the first TL50 rolled off the production line. Scomadi edited their badge in April 2015 changing the Italian Flag at the top of the badge to the Union Flag. In June 2015 the first batch of TL125's came off the production line, one month later the first Scomadi's were sold outside of the UK in Thailand. In 2016 the first batch of 100 Scomadi TL200 scooters arrived with this batch being known as the First Production (FP) and came numbered with a plaque. By the end of 2016 Scomadi's were available in the UK as well as across much of Europe, parts of East Asia, New Zealand, Australia and Columbia.
Move to Thailand.
After Scomadi's divorce from Chinese manufacturing company Hanway Motors they announced a new factory in Thailand in 2017. In March 2017 Scomadi launched their new Model, the Turismo Technica (TT), at the Bangkok International Motor Show. In February 2020 Scomadi opened their new Factory in Thailand located near Pattaya.
Management/Ownership change and New factory.
In 2019, after some difficult financial times, Scomadi saw a change in management. The company since the start had been British owned. Following financial challenges, the management structure was changed. This saw the involvement of two firms, Minor International and CT Engineering. Minor International is a leisure brand specialist, and CT Automotive is a component manufacturer. CT Automotive in particular, bought the double effect of bringing components manufacture into the process, as well as being able to utilise their distribution channels. Founder Frank Sanderson and his wife moved to Thailand to continue involvement, with Frank continuing to work on development and technical innovation.
A new factory was built for Scomadi in Pattaya in Thailand in 2020, in the national "Bike Hub" area, with famous motorcycle marques Triumph, Ducati and Harley Davidson. This is a state of the art assembly factory with an advanced assembly line that can pump out a scooter every 20 minutes.
Controversy with Royal Alloy Scooters.
Scomadi scooters were originally manufactured in China by Hanway Motors who initially productionised the Scomadi 3D CAD designs. After many delays, they brought the 50 cc to market in 2015. This was followed by the 125 cc then the 200cc TL models.
A court case later ensued where Hanway claimed to have contributed more to the project than the brand owners thought fair.
Scomadi themselves claimed that the Chinese producer, Hanway, had "violated Scomadi's intellectual property rights by making scooters under the Royal Alloy brand, which look almost identical to Scomadi designs". Royal Alloy had started producing and selling scooters that were the same scooter as the Scomadi, but with subtle visual differences 
This court case was found in Hanways favor. Scomadi moved to appeal, but later negotiated to a compromise, which saw the cessation of all legal action between the two by 2019 on condition that the conditions of said agreement were not breached.
Details of the court case can be found here... https://www.casemine.com/judgement/uk/5b2897a92c94e06b9e19813d
Design.
Scomadi TL scooters are a modern design, but resemble 1960s era Innocenti produced Lambretta's, in particular the GP/DL model. Early Scomadi TL scooters used Piaggio engines. The Scomadi TT still kept its Lambretta themed styling but stater to move away from the GP/DL. Multiple prototypes and drawings have been seen including a scooter that resembles a Lambretta Series 1 and a TL with a 385cc Moto Morini engine.
Models.
Timeline of Models.
Distribution is controlled by Scomadi World Wide who have just reintroduced the new re engineered Thai manufactured models in 2021 . The emphasis on providing the service that current owners deserve that was lacking during the turbulent transition period .

Marie Walker Last

Marie Walker Last (14 March 1917 – 25 March 2017) was a British artist working in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s before returning to continue painting in her Yorkshire home until her death in 2017. She developed her own style of Tachisme abstract painting.
Early life.
Marie Walker Last was born to Ethel and Hubert Walker, a textile manufacturing family in Cleckheaton. Her father was an art collector and the young Marie was inspired by an artist aunt Hilda Annetta Walker to study art in Leeds. In 1953 she joined a group of amateur painters on a painting course in Bruges, led by the landscape painter, Jack Merriott. Under his tutelage, she became a member of the Northern Federation of Artists and attended their summer painting schools during the mid 1950s. Here she met leading artists of the time, including Robert Medley and Terry Frost, they encouraged Marie to apply to Chelsea School of Art, where in 1956 she was accepted.
Career.
London.
Walker Last left Yorkshire to take up her place at the Chelsea College of Arts where she was taught by Vivian Pitchforth in the late 1950s. The gallery director Denis Bowen became a close friend and mentor and organised her first London exhibition at the New Vision Gallery. There she worked closely with avant garde European artists - including members of the Zero. She had a lifelong friendship with Robert Graves, the artist César Domela - who shared a studio with Piet Mondrian -and Domela's family and the artist Nancy Horrocks and her husband Major General Sir Brian Horrocks. Walker Last shared a studio with the Guyanese artist Aubrey Williams for several years before returning to Yorkshire to marry local solicitor Tom Last. She joined the Women's International Art Club and exhibited in Britain and overseas with them.

Vedas (horse)

Vedas (1902 – 1906) was a British Thoroughbred racehorse. As a two-year-old in 1904 he was highly tried and won six of his ten races including the Brocklesby Stakes and Molecomb Stakes as well as being placed in the Coventry Stakes and Gimcrack Stakes. In the following spring he recorded his biggest win in the 2000 Guineas but was injured shortly afterwards and failed on his only subsequent start. He was reported to have died in early 1906.
Background.
Vedas was a brown horse bred by Valerie, Lady Meux and owned during his racing career by West Fenton de Wend-Fenton. The colt was sent into training with William Thomas "Jack" Robinson at his Foxhill stables in Wiltshire.
He was sired by Florizel II, a full-brother to both Diamond Jubilee and Persimmon and a top-class performer in own right, with wins including the Goodwood Cup, Jockey Club Cup and Ascot Gold Vase. As a breeding stallion he sired Volodyovski and Doricles and was the damsire of St Louis. Vedas' dam Agnostic, a half-sister of the Epsom Oaks winner Bonny Jean, also produced Gemma (also by Florizel II) who in turn produced Sardanapale.
Racing career.
1904: two-year-old season.
Vedas began his racing career in the Brocklesby Stakes over five furlongs at Lincoln Racecourse on 23 March in which he was made the 2/1 favourite and led from the start to win by four lengths from Captain Jack. In the following month, he won again, taking the Sefton Park Plate at Liverpool at odds of 2/5, but on this occasion he was eased down by his jockey in the final strides and was almost caught on the line by the filly Princess Sagan. At the end of April, the colt started joint-favourite for the Sandown Park Stud Produce Stakes and won "easily" by three lengths from Norman Bride. In May, he extended his winning run when he successfully conceded thirteen pounds to the highly regarded filly Queen of the Earth in the Spring Two-Year-Old Plate at Kempton Park Racecourse.
In June, Vedas started 11/10 favourite for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot but sustained his first defeat as he was beaten two lengths into second by Lord Rosebery's colt Cicero. At the time, many of Jack Robinson's trainees were suffering from Equine influenza, and it was suggested that Vedas may have been affected. Vedas returned to the track in July and won the Royal Plate over five furlongs at Windsor Racecourse. On 5 August, Vedas contested the Molecomb Stakes over five furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse in which he was ridden by G McCall and started the 8/15 favourite. He led from the start and won "as he liked" by two lengths from Standen. At York Racecourse in August, the colt started favourite against thirteen opponents for the Gimcrack Stakes but finished third behind a filly named Desiree. On his penultimate appearance of the season, he was assigned top weight (alongside Polymelus) in the Imperial Produce Stakes at Kempton in October and finished unplaced behind Khammurabi. Vedas ended the year with a narrow defeat, again under top weight, in the Chesterfield Nursery Plate at Derby Racecourse.
Vedas earned a total of £3,939 in 1904.
1905: three-year-old season.
Vedas began his second season by finishing unplaced in the Lincolnshire Handicap over one mile in March. In April he was an easy winner of the Bickerstaffe Stakes at Liverpool. On 3 May 1905, ridden by Herbert Jones, Vedas started at odds of 11/2 for the 97th running of the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket. His twelve opponents included the Dewhurst Stakes winner Rouge Croix, who started favourite, Llangibby (New Stakes), Plum Centre and Signorino (runner-up in the Middle Park Stakes). Racing on heavy ground Vedas tracked the leaders as the outsider Brother Bill set the pace before moving up to take the lead approaching the final furlong. He went four lengths clear of his rivals and despite tiring in the final strides he prevailed by two lengths from Signorino with Llangibby a head away in third. The result provided an unusual coincidence concerning the number "13": Vedas, on his thirteenth start, was number 13 on the racecard, and drawn number thirteen in thirteen-runner field, while the numbers in his starting price (11/2) totalled 13; his win came 13 years after his trainer rode Bona Vista to victory in the race.
Vedas was strongly fancied for the Epsom Derby but was found to be lame a few days before the race and was withdrawn from the contest. After a lengthy break he returned in the Gratwicke Stakes over one and a half miles but failed to reproduce his earlier form and was well-beaten in a race won by Polymelus. Towards the end of the year Vedas's owner, Mr West Fenton de-Wend Fenton was "warned-off" (banned from any involvement in horse racing) by the Jockey Club after riding his own horse to defeat in a match race at Sandown which involved highly suspicious betting patterns.
Vedas earned £5,150 on 1905.
1906: four-year-old season.
Vedas remained in training as a four-year-old but in April it was announced that he had "broken down badly" and would not race again. He was reported dead shortly afterwards.
Assessment and honours.
In their book, "A Century of Champions", based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Vedas an "inferior" winner of the 2000 Guineas.

Like a Flowing River

Like a Flowing River () is a 2018 Chinese period drama based on Ah Nai's novel "River of Time" (大江东去 IPA:). It is directed by Kong Sheng and Huang Wei, and stars Wang Kai, Yang Shuo and Dong Zijian as budding entrepreneurs who take advantage of the economic reforms being rolled out in 1970s China.
The drama is a celebration of 40 years of China's open door policy, and will be split into two parts. The first part will run for 45 episodes, and air on Dragon TV and Beijing TV beginning December 10, 2018. The second part began airing on Dragon TV and Zhejiang TV on December 20, 2020.
Production.
Shooting.
The "Jin Ling County (晋陵县)" in "Like a Flowing River" was filmed in Nanjing. As the Yeshan iron ore plant in Nanjing retains the 1970s to 1980s appearance, the building was used for a variety of scenes; scenes of bookstores, photo studios, guest house, government offices, etc. were all shot there. The drama also filmed in Nanjing Yuntai Shan Pyrite Co., Ltd., also in Nanjing, where the crew filmed the mine dormitory, canteen, town hall and children's school, where Song Yunhui taught. The Ministry of Chemical Industry was filmed at "Nanjing Art Institute". In order to create a more authentic "Xiao Lei Jia Village (小雷家村)", the crew planted a large tree at the location a year in advance, and spent more than 20 days in the village to shoot.
It is reported that the money used to "restore the texture of the age" was double the amount used in other TV series, with ultra-wide format used for the first time. For the many snow scenes, the crew used naturally degradable paper foam instead of the cheaper magnesium sulfate or aluminum, citing that the old way produced pollution. Actor Wang Kai reportedly lost weight to achieve the look the impoverished main character, while Yang Shuo gained weight to become the well-off secretary of the village.
Principal photography began on February 23, 2018 in Jing County, Xuancheng, Anhui and ended on June 26.
Casting and release.
At Tencent Video VVision Conference held on November 8, 2017, "Like a Flowing River" was announced, with confirmation of its television broadcast on Dragon TV as a tribute to the 40th anniversary of China's open door policy. Beijing TV also announced its broadcast shortly after. Daylight Entertainment announced Wang Kai as Song Yunhui and Yang Shuo as Lei Dongbao on the 13th and 14th respectively. On December 6, Dong Zijian was cast as Yang Xun.
Original soundtrack.
The main composer of the "Like a Flowing River OST" is Dong Yingda, who also worked on "The Great River" (2018) and "Ming Dynasty" (2019). On December 4, the show held a press conference in Shanghai, and announced that the promotion song of the same name would be sung by Wang Kai.

Uttam is a solid state GaAs based Active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar under development by Electronics and Radar Development Establishment (LRDE), a laboratory of the Defence Research &amp; Development Organisation (DRDO). It is a low probability of intercept radar intended to be equipped with HAL Tejas Mark 1A, HAL Tejas Mark 2 and HAL TEDBF aircraft with plans to implement a larger and more powerful variant on-board India's 5th Generation fighter aircraft HAL AMCA.
It is a liquid cooled AESA radar featuring quad band modules that can be stacked to form a larger unit. This allows the manufacturer to scale the radar to be used in larger aircraft. There are plan afoot to create a larger scalable design to be used in India's 5th Generation fighter aircraft HAL AMCA.
The radar development began in 2012 and its full-scale model was displayed at the Aero India 2017. A fully functional AESA radar prototype was unveiled at Aero India 2019, the radar prototype was mounted inside the glass nose of a Tejas prototype. Three units are in various phases of testing, as of 2021. Uttam AESA radar has completed 230 hours of airborne testing onboard two Tejas fighter jets (LSP2 and LSP3) beside an executive jet; presumed to be DRDO's Dornier 228 "Nabhratna" used as a flying test bed by LRDE. Once fully validated and certified, plan is to introduce the radar in later batches of Tejas Mark 1A aircraft. The Uttam radar will be used with DRDO's Unified Electronic Warfare suite.
During Aero India 2021, there was a licensing agreements for TOT from DRDO to HAL for manufacturing and integration of Uttam in Mark 1A variant of Tejas.
Operational Modes.
Uttam AESA radar has a total of 18 modes in Air to Air, Air to Ground and Air to Sea roles. The modes have been validated on-board a business jet and further proofing is being done on HAL Tejas to validate the same on supersonic platform.

Rosalie Favell

Rosalie Favell (born 1958) is a Métis (Cree/British) artist from Winnipeg, Manitoba currently based in Ottawa, Ontario, working with photography and digital collage techniques. Favell creates self-portraits, sometimes featuring her own image and other times featuring imagery that represents her, often making use of archival photos of family members and images from pop culture.
Early life.
Rosalie Favell was born in 1958 to a Métis father named Gerald, and a mother of Scottish/English descent named Florence McFadyen. She was raised in an Anglican household where the family's ancestry was not openly discussed. Receiving her first camera at age ten, Favell first formally explored her artistic impulse a number of years later at a night photography course which inspired her to continue learning the medium.
Education.
Favell completed a bachelor of applied arts at Ryerson Polytechnic Institute in 1984, a master of fine arts at the University of New Mexico in 1998, and a PhD(ABD) in Cultural Mediations at Carleton University in 2009. In the late 1990s, when she was making a shift from documentary photography to digital photo manipulations, Favell learned from fellow artist Larry Glawson.
Rosalie Favell has taught many courses and workshops throughout her career. She has taught courses at the University of Manitoba (98-99), the Institute of American Indian Art Santa-Fe, (94-95), Carleton University, and the University of Ottawa, to name a few. Favell has also taught digital photography at Discovery University since 2013, a program run jointly by The Ottawa Mission and the University of Ottawa to offer people of low-income situations educational opportunities. Favell has done several residencies as well, including residencies at the Banff Centre, and the Nigig Visiting Artist Residency at OCAD University, where she presented the work "Facing the Camera" (2008-ongoing) that consisted of a series of portraits of members of the Indigenous arts community.
Involvement in organizations.
Favell was an early member of the NIIPA (Native Indian/Inuit Photographers’ Association) in Hamilton, the first artist-run centre specializing in photo-based artwork by Indigenous artists in Canada. She was a board member at the Floating Gallery Centre for Photography in Winnipeg and the Original Women's Network: a Native Women's Resource Centre. Favell has also worked with Nepalese women's groups in Katmandu.
Themes.
A prominent and ongoing theme in Favell's work is self-portraiture. Favell often references the traditions of portraiture and self-portraiture, using traditional composition or even existing portraits, and replacing the historical sitter with herself. An example of this is Favell's "The Artist in Her Museum: The Collector" (2005) that references Charles Wilson Peale's self-portrait displaying his collection, "The Artist in His Museum" (1822). In Favell's work she replaces the collector with her own image and the collection of specimens with her family photos, and in doing so questions and overwrites the colonial practice of collection and display. In her photo manipulations, Favell re-contextualizes specific portraits and the portrait tradition on a whole, often introducing her own Indigenous identity to create a dialogue. Fellow artist and writer Barry Ace summarizes Favell's approach by stating:
“The collected images act as an "aide-memoire", igniting personal and collective memory, while photo-digital practice provides her with an expansive tableau for visual expressions of self, family, identity and sexuality.”
Favell has also created many works using documentary photography to create an image of the Indigenous community that she is a part of. Works such as "Portraits in Blood" (1980s) use photographic portraits of Indigenous artists and friends to express and document Favell's own navigation of Indigenous identity. Her ongoing "Facing the Camera" series, which began in 2008, consists of dynamic photographic portraits of roughly 450 Indigenous artists from across the globe including Daphne Odjig, Greg Hill, Bear Witness of A Tribe Called Red, Caroline Monnet, Heather Igloliorte, Kent Monkman, Mary Watt, Maree Clarke, Alex Janvier, and Mary Anne Barkhouse. The active poses that Favell captures in "Facing the Camera" lend agency to the sitters and call into question stereotypes created in part by a history of portraiture of Indigenous people from a colonial perspective.
Awards.
Favell has received recognition and support for her work through several awards and grants throughout her career. Favell was awarded the biennial Karsh Award in 2012 in recognition of her extensive body of photographic work, the Ontario Arts Council Chalmers Arts Fellowship in 2004, and the Canada Council for the Arts Victor Martyn Lynch-Staunton Award in 2003, to name a few. In 2017, Favell was awarded The Paul de Hueck and Norman Walford Career Achievement Award for Art Photography.
Works.
Exhibited and collected works.
Favell's work has been exhibited at and collected by the National Gallery of Canada, the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography, Library and Archives Canada, the Ottawa Art Gallery, Karsh-Masson Gallery, Cube Gallery, the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian, and the Rockwell Museum of Western Art. An exhibition at the Canadian Museum of Contemporary Photography (National Gallery of Canada) called "Steeling the Gaze: Portraits by Aboriginal Artists" that challenged stereotypical portrayals of Indigenous people through portraiture featured Favell's work. Her portraits appeared alongside the work of other Indigenous artists such as KC Adams, Carl Beam, Dana Claxton, Thirza Cuthand, Kent Monkman, David Neel, Shelley Niro, Greg Staats, Jeff Thomas, and Bear Witness.
Collaborative projects and groups.
In 2017, Rosalie Favell organized a collaborative project called "Wrapped in Culture" which involved Indigenous artists from Canada: Favell herself, Barry Ace (Anishinaabe-Odawa), Meryl McMaster (Cree) and Adrian Stimson (Siksika-Blackfoot), and from Australia: Maree Clarke (Mutti Mutti, Yorta Yorta, Boon Wurrung), Vicki West (Tasmanian), Mitch Mahoney (Boon Wurrung, Barkindji), Molly Mahoney (Boon Wurrung, Barkindji), Kerri Clarke (Boon Wurrung), and Wade Mahoney (Barkindji). The ten artists created a traditional Blackfoot buffalo robe and an Australian Aboriginal possum skin cloak at workshops spanning a few weeks. The robes were incised and painted with designs in an act of storytelling, reclamation, and community building.
Rosalie Favell is part of the OO7 (Ottawa Ontario Seven) Collective, a group of Indigenous artists that includes Ariel Smith, Barry Ace, Frank Shebageget, Leo Yerxa, Michael Belmore, Ron Noganosh, and invited “special agents.” The group provides an alternative and experimental space for Ottawa-based Indigenous artists at different stages in their careers.

Marienbad (video game)

Marienbad was a 1962 Polish puzzle mainframe game created by Elwro engineer Witold Podgórski in Wrocław, Poland for its Odra 1003. It was an adaption of the logic game nim. Inspired by the discussion in the magazine "Przekrój" of a variant of nim in the 1961 film "Last Year at Marienbad" ("L'Année dernière à Marienbad"), named "Marienbad" by the magazine, Podgórski programmed the game for the in-development 1003 mainframe, released in 1963. The game had players opposing the computer in alternating rounds of removing matches from a set, with the last player to take a match the loser. As the computer always played the optimal moves, it was essentially unbeatable.
Like many games in the early history of video games, Marienbad did not spread far beyond the initial location. Elwro did not produce or advertise the game, though Podgórski recreated it at the Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna (Military University of Technology in Warsaw). The game fell into obscurity, with no pictures or documentation surviving to recreate it in its original form; as there is only one known Odra 1003 remaining and no way of recreating the game exists, it is considered lost. Despite its simplicity, it is considered possibly the first Polish computer or video game.
Gameplay.
In nim, players take turns removing at least one object from a set of objects, traditionally matchsticks, with the goal of either being or not being the player who removes the last object. The gameplay options can be modeled mathematically. In "Marienbad"s default game mode, four rows of matches were generated, with either one, three, five or seven matches within each row. The side that was left with the last match lost. The computer printout showed the player the current layout of matches. A single player could play the game at a time, whose turn alternated with the computer's. Regardless of which side started the game, the computer was almost certain to be the winner, as it always made the perfect moves.
On its maximum settings, the game consisted of 8,000 rows containing up to 1 trillion matches, requiring an hour for the computer to choose its next move. The game did not support a video output, as the Odra 1003 did not have a screen. Instead, the game was played via a teletypewriter and card perforator, on which the machine printed the results.
Development.
Elwro was a Polish company established in 1959 and based in based in Wrocław, Poland, that designed and manufactured mainframe and microcomputers. Its first release was the Odra 1001 mainframe in 1960, followed by the Odra 1002 in 1962 and the Odra 1003 in 1963. Witold Podgórski was a recent graduate of the Wrocław University of Technology, having majored in electronic engineering and specialized in mathematical machines. Having first heard about the existence of "electronic brains" in 1955 in high school, he embarked on five years of study toward the automation of "digital machines". He completed his masters thesis at Elwro, where he was employed on 10 October 1961, working with the Odra 1001. He developed a way to manipulate the computer's memory to allow content to be saved, thus paving the way for the Odra 1003. The new machine used modern transistor switches that allowed for 500 operations per second, and the drum memory of the Odra 1003 program had a capacity of 40 kilobytes.
While working for Elwro in 1961, Podgórski discovered the logic game nim while reading an issue in the weekly magazine "Przekrój". The magazine described a two-player game where players remove any number of items from one of four rows, with the player holding the last item losing. "Przekrój" named this variant of nim as "Marienbad" after the 1960 French film "Last Year at Marienbad" ("L'Année dernière à Marienbad"), in which characters frequently play these mathematical duels. Podgórski became inspired by the use of the game nim in the film after reading about its principles.
While sitting in a multi-hour lecture for his obligatory military study class, Podgórski decided to decipher the Marienbad algorithm and save it to a binary system which could be understood by computers. Podgórski would later assert that the algorithm was extremely simple to implement into a computer and could be expressed in two words, adding that if nobody was interested in it he would take it to the grave. He programmed the game for the first prototype of the Odra 1003, then in development and scheduled to be installed in the Board of the Topographic General Staff of the Polish Army in Wrocław.
The game, intended for logical duels, was developed solely by Podgórski by creating the algorithm, writing a list of instructions which were printed on sheets the size of postcards, and manually setting the initial state of each memory cell. He designed the game to be unbeatable: if the human player made a single mistake, the computer would win. While employees in the Elwro factory knew that the result of the game was predetermined, many volunteered to play it. They could not beat the standard 16-match version of "Marienbad", let alone higher settings of the game.
Legacy.
Like many games in the early history of video games, "Marienbad" did not spread far beyond the initial location. Mainframe computers were rare throughout the world and primarily located in government or military institutions or large corporations, so were generally unavailable for amusement purposes. Elwro produced only 42 Odra 1003 mainframes between 1963 and 1965. Elwro declined to publish or advertise the game, and the title was mostly forgotten. The game did spread beyond the Elwro factory, however. After developing the game, Podgórski became a student at the Wojskowa Akademia Techniczna (Military University of Technology in Warsaw), and with the assistance of fellow student Bogdan Bleja set up a version of the game there on an Odra 1003 that was mediated by a university operator. The computer, and therefore the game, could be used or played by any student, but only through an operator who received the intended input from the player and passed the information to the computer. As in Podgórski's original game instance, the game was essentially unbeatable; the operators as a result actively discouraged the players from participating. The university authorities supported this, as they wanted to forcibly remove the "nasty habit of harassing computers for logic games", which they believed should be used only for serious military purposes. Players took to holding secret meetings in front of the massive computer in the late evenings when the operators were gone. Podgórski recalled that despite knowing that the game was designed to always beat the player, many people spent many hours trying to decipher the algorithm or win.
In later years, variants of nim and Marienbad were the second most popular type of computer game present on Polish computers after noughts and crosses, since it was a relatively simple game to program. , who would later become the two-decade long host of "Wheel of Fortune" from the 1970s, proposed to Polish television a game show where players compete against a computer in nim on a Momik 8b minicomputer. Meanwhile, Podgórski continued to work for Elwro, co-creating Odra computers, though he did not stop working on games. After colleagues brought a variant of the Mancala board game from Egypt, he became inspired to adapt it to the computer. This time he did not want to create an unbeatable game, but included adjustable difficulty levels to create a fun experience regardless of the player's expertise.
Writing for "Polish Bytes" ("Bajty Polskie"), Bartłomiej Kluska asserts that as the only copy of the Odra 1003 is kept at the Museum of Technology in Warsaw in an inactive state, the original game of "Marienbad" no longer exists outside of the memory of players. No recreations of the game have been made for more modern computers, and there are no known photos or documentation for how the game was played or created. In the research paper "Gry komputerowe jako dziedzictwo kulturowe" ("Computer games as a cultural heritage") by Maria Garda, she notes that the game should be written about only in the past tense as the original elements have not been preserved, adding that while the "Marienbad" algorithm can be recreated in a new programming environment, reconstruction of the physical transistors of the original computer would be nearly impossible. The paper further compared the challenges of playing this title in the modern era to playing "Super Mario Bros." on the originally intended equipment in 50 years' time.
"Marienbad" is considered one of the first Polish video games, developed almost 20 years before later candidates "OiX" (1984), "Gąsienica" (1985), and "Puszka Pandory" (1986), and well before the first well-known Polish game, "Tajemnica Statuetki" (1993). Łódź game historian Bartek Kluska made this assertion in his foundational book on the Polish video gaming industry, "Polish Bytes"; his research uncovered the game as 24 years older than the game that previously held the title. Kluska notes, however, that it was preceded by "Kółko i krzyżyk", a version of tic-tac-toe written by Department of Mathematical Apparatus programmer Bogdan Miś in 1960 for the computer, using a chess-sized grid. Michał Nowicki of Gram.pl asserted that Kluska's research, in contrast with the previous and more imprecise Polish video gaming text "Dawno temu w grach (Once upon a time in games)", allows Marienbad's claim as the first Polish computer or video game to be made with almost 100% certainty. An article by retailer Empik further asserts that "Marienbad"s simplicity and lack of video output means that the term "computer game" is a somewhat exaggerated term to describe it, much less "video game".
Garda's paper claims, however, that regardless of its simplicity the game has importance as one of the earliest computer or video games from the region, although Marcin Kosman of Gamezilla notes that this first attempt at creating a Polish computer game went largely unnoticed. Jacek Głowacki of "Gry Online" stated that despite its obscurity, it should be considered the ancestor of the modern Polish video gaming industry, and that its existence and creation are worth remembering. The 2018 Ars Independent Festival held an exhibition entitled "From Marienbad to Novigrad" which explored the history of the Polish video gaming industry from "Marienbad" to "" (2015).

Relative thermal index

The Relative thermal index (RTI) is a characteristic parameter related to the ability of plastic materials to retain thermal degradation.
The RTI is part of the longterm thermal aging program (LTTA) described in the UL 746B standard from UL.
During the process of the UL 746B program, the degradation in hot air of certain properties of the material like dielectric and mechanic strength, is investigated with regards to thermal-aging. For a full study, the candidate material (B) is aged together with a reference material A (control) with already known RTI value in the same ovens. The RTI is the rounded temperature in degrees C, at which the properties of "B" have decreased to 50 percent of their initial value in about the same amount of time (correlation time) than it takes for "A" at its own RTI value. A maximum correlation time of 60.000 hours is considered acceptable for many electrical applications, however it may also become as low as 5.000 hours according to UL 746B. If a material has not been investigated (yet), the RTI shown is based on the generic class (polymer type) of the material.
Though the RTI is an index, it is given in Celsius units. The UL 746B standard distinguishes between three sub-categories of the RTI:
There is also the "RTI Elongation" (by means of "Elongation at break") for films and other nonrigid materials.

Volkswagen Jetta (China)

The Chinese version of the Volkswagen Jetta is manufactured by the joint venture FAW-Volkswagen since 1991. In 2019, the name was split out from Volkswagen to become its own marque and the model became known as the Jetta VA3.
First generation (Jetta Mk2/A2/King/Pioneer; 1991).
The Mark 2 Jetta went on to become the first Volkswagen model produced in China by Volkswagen Group China's second joint venture partner FAW-Volkswagen. Production began on 5 December 1991. Initially sold as complete knock down (CKD) kits, local manufacturing has gradually taken over in the form of Semi-Knocked Down kits in 1992, and full local production in 1995. The car has had three revisions since its inception in China.
Jetta King.
The Volkswagen Jetta King, is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was launched in April 1997 and replaced the Volkswagen Jetta. The Jetta King was the result of the technical combination between the Volkswagen Jetta and design scheme from the fourth generation Volkswagen Passat in 1997. Production started in August 1998, and its name was changed to "Jetta King" (or 大众捷达王 in Mandarin). The second facelift was revealed in March 2004 (taking influences from Volkswagen's most expensive model, the Phaeton). On 29 July 2007, it was announced that First Automotive Works expanded its production of the Mark 2 Jetta by building a new assembly plant in Chengdu, Sichuan Province in Southwest China. The expansion was driven by the high demand for the car, a desire to expand in the western part of the country, as well as the long-term goal of FAW to develop new derivatives from the car's platform independently of Volkswagen.
The most striking feature of the Jetta King was the new front end. The interior of the different equipment lines came from the Corrado and Passat B5. The dimensions of the vehicles are different depending on the chosen equipment line. Only the trunk volume of 660 liters is the same for all units.
Initially it was only the 1.6-liter four-cylinder engine with 5 valves per cylinder and a displacement of 1595 cc available. The power of it was 74 kW. It had a manual four-speed gearbox, which later was replaced by a five speed gearbox. From November 1998 onward, there was an option for a 4-speed automatic. A month earlier, the first units were made with ABS (option).
In April 2001, the equipment line Meeresbrise was launched with an EFI engine and a power of 64 kW. A 1.9-liter diesel engine with a displacement of 1896 cc and a power output of 47 kW was added to the lineup in April 2002. The 1.6-liter engine was removed from the engine range. At the same time, the Jetta König was facelifted in 2002 with new front and rear fascias. A 1.6-liter EFI engine producing 70 kW was included in the range. At the same time the prestige model Meeresbrise was replaced by the new Avantgarde. It had dual airbags and can be recognized on the green or black tinted windows. From June 2009 the 1.6-liter RSH engine (type EA111) engine with a power of 70 kW was available.
Following equipment lines of the Jetta King were offered: AT, ATF, Avantgarde, CDX, CiF, CiX, CT, GDF, GiF, GT, GTI, GTX and Meeresbrise.
The Volkswagen Jetta King was also available in the form of a 2-door pickup truck. Few of these were produced.
Jetta Pioneer.
The third facelift called the Volkswagen Jetta Pioneer, is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was released in March 2010 replacing the Volkswagen Jetta King and taking some inspirations from stylings of Volkswagen models of the newest generation. A diesel version of the Jetta is also on sale, but a large proportion are in service as taxis in many cities in China, rather than as private cars.
The new exterior brought new production and sales records. It received new front and rear bumpers, along with new grill and lights. Furthermore, there was a new instrument panel with a three-spoke steering wheel to give the impression of a sporty car and driver's airbag as standard. Other standard features were a CD player that could read MP3 CDs, an ISOFIX system for child seats, the seat belt alarm for the driver and an antilock braking system and EBD for better distribution of the braking force. Only the taxi version had electrically adjustable rear view mirrors.
The 1.6-liter RSH with an output of 70 kW (94 HP) served as the standard engine. The consumption is indicated at 7.5 liters per 100 km (31 MPG US). However, the favorable fuel consumption was the optional 1.9L SDI engine with a power of 47 kW (63 HP). The consumption of this engine was indicated at 4.5 liters per 100 km (52 MPG US).
This version of the Jetta was not offered in different trim levels. It was a single model for the Chinese market. It varied in two forms only, one as a family car and the other as a taxi.
This was also the last Jetta in China to use the A2 platform after 20 years of production. 
Second generation (New Jetta; 2013).
The Volkswagen New Jetta 2013 (in Chinese: “大众新捷达2013款”) is a Chinese Volkswagen model produced by FAW-Volkswagen at its plants in Changchun and Chengdu. It was launched in March 2013 and replaced the Volkswagen Jetta Pioneer.
The New Jetta is available with two different engines of the type "EA211". These are corresponding by region to the China IV or China V emission standard. It is a four-cylinder in-line engine with 4 valves per cylinder. The fuel injection is controlled electronically, as in all modern engines. The performance is 66 or 81 kW.
Following equipment lines are offered: Avantgarde (时尚), Comfortline (舒适) and Luxury (豪华). There's a 5-speed manual and a 6-speed automatic transmission option.
The New Jetta was given a facelift in 2017 with a new front and rear design and a brand new 1.5 litre engine and 7 speed dual clutch gearbox for the 230TSI model.
To differentiate this version with 2013 type, the selling name was branded as "New Jetta 2017" (in Chinese: “新捷达2017款”).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jetta VA3&lt;br&gt;A new car marque was launched in China in February 2019 known as Jetta and the one of the models, the Jetta VA3 is a facelifted and rebadged Jetta Night. According to pictures found on Chinese car website Autohome, the Jetta VA3 was said to be powered by two engines, a 1.4 litre turbo and the 1.5 litre naturally aspirated "EA211" four cylinder engine. The VA3 was officially listed in September 2019 and the 1.5 litre EA211 engine is available paired to a 5 speed manual and 6 speed automatic gearbox.

Josephine Uwineza

Josephine "Fina" Uwineza is a Rwandan entrepreneur and social activist. In 2018, she plans to open the first microbrewery within Rwanda which will feature a staff composed entirely of local women.
Early life.
Josephine was born in 1964 to a family with five other siblings. In 1974, her father was assassinated during the 1973 Rwandan coup d'état which led Fina's mother to exile Rwanda with all of her children in tow. The Uwineza family went to a few neighboring countries where other exiled family members had been staying but eventually ended up in Canada. Josephine later returned to Rwanda in 1998 to provide aid to the nation following the Rwandan genocide which led to a large chunk of the population dead and the nation in shambles.
Career.
Upon returning to Rwanda with her husband and child, Josephine managed a Chinese restaurant, Flamingo, within the city of Kigali. She managed the restaurant for 13 years before deciding to close it down in 2015 after deciding that she wasn't getting enough satisfaction from the business and wanted to spend more time with her family. Following the closing of Flamingo, Josephine became a member of the Peace Through Business program held by the Institute for Economic Empowerment of Women which targets women in the countries of Rwanda and Afghanistan who are starting their own businesses. Through the Peace Through Business program, Josephine met Nancy Coldham, a consultant who aids in the financial pursuits of women in low-income nations. Josephine had the beginnings of an idea to open a new business within Kigali which Coldham encouraged and even helped instigate by helping Josephine find an outside source for help with this start-up.
Coldham found help in the form of Beau's All Natural Brewing Company, a brewing company in Ontario, Canada. Beau's had interest in providing resources and training to someone who wanted to start their own brewery which Josephine could take advantage of. A team of leads from Beau's visited Rwanda in 2016 to assess the situation firsthand which ultimately led to agreeing to aid Josephine with her start-up. Following the visit from Beau's, Josephine and her newfound friends in Beau's launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funding for the brewery, citing the importance of a brewery within Rwanda as well as the business plan for the brewery to be owned and operate entirely by women. The Kickstarter campaign raised over CAD $95,000 with over 1,000 backers.
Rwanda Brewery.
Josephine's brewery, planned to open in 2018, will feature a staff composed entirely of women from areas surrounding Kigali. The brewery will make use of ingredients that are sourced mostly from Rwanda. The main ingredients for the majority of the brews that will be produced include banana and sorghum which are popular ingredients to use within African brews. Josephine hopes that the implementation of Rwanda's first microbrewery will be a positive step for the country as a whole since Rwanda enjoys the consumption of beer and being able to have a locally produced microbrew will be a source of unifying strength for the nation.

John Raynor Dart (1855 – 27 May 1935) was an Anglican priest in the West Coast and Nelson districts of New Zealand in late-nineteenth to early-20th century.
Born in Melbourne, Dart was a goldminer's son, and came to New Zealand with his family in 1865. He initially worked with a legal firm and then the Blenheim Post Office. After working with the Church of Nativity, he became the lay secretary for Nelson diocese in 1889, a connection he maintained for the next 50 years. In 1890 he began to study for the ministry at Bishopdale Theological College. Dart was ordained deacon by Bishop Mules on 28 December 1894, as curate of Brunnerton and Grey Valley. He became a priest and clerical secretary of the synod in 1895, and held incumbencies at Reefton, Westport (1901), and Wakefield (1915 or possibly 1913). He became the vicar of All Saints Parish, Nelson, in 1925, and Archdeacon of Waimea in 1926. Dart's ill-health forced his retirement in 1931, after which he became director of the Nelson YMCA. He died on 27 May 1935 in his Brougham Street home, and was buried at Wakapuaka Cemetery.
Dart had two sons, B.W.R. Dart and the educator and playwright G.F.J. Dart.

William Barnes Jr.

William Barnes Jr. (November 17, 1866 – June 25, 1930) was an American journalist and politician. The longtime owner and publisher of the "Albany Evening Journal", Barnes was most notable as a major behind the scenes player in state and U.S. politics as a leader of New York's Republican Party.
Barnes was born in Albany, New York, and graduated from The Albany Academy in 1884 and Harvard University in 1888. He worked briefly as a newspaper reporter for the "Albany Evening Journal" before purchasing the "Albany Morning Express", of which he was publisher and editor. In 1889 he purchased the "Evening Journal", of which he was also editor and publisher. Barnes became active in New York politics as a leader of the Republican Party. In 1891, he became head of the party in both the city and in Albany County, and in 1894 Republican Oren E. Owen won the mayor's office. This victory brought about Republican dominance in Albany, and Barnes went on to serve as a member of the New York Republican State Committee from 1892 to 1914, and the committee's chairman from 1911 to 1914. He was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions of 1904, 1908, and 1912, and a member of the Republican National Committee from 1912 to 1916. As an ally of Thomas C. Platt, Barnes became a major figure in national Republican politics; his support for successive Republican presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft led to his appointment as the U.S. Surveyor of Customs for the Port of Albany, a lucrative position he held from 1899 to 1911. In 1915, he was a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention.
In 1912, Barnes was a key player in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for the incumbent Taft; in response, Roosevelt ran as the candidate of the Progressive Party, and the split among Republicans helped elect the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson. In a July 1914 editorial, Roosevelt accused Barnes of being a corrupt party boss who conspired with the Democratic Tammany Hall leader Charles Francis Murphy to block progressive reforms in New York. Barnes sued Roosevelt for libel, and the 1915 trial ended with a verdict in favor of Roosevelt. For several years afterwards, Barnes lived in New York City while maintaining his voting residence in Albany.
In 1921, Democrat William Stormont Hackett won the mayor's office, ending Barnes' dominance over Albany politics and ushering in more than 50 years of control by the Democratic organization of Daniel P. O'Connell. In 1925, Barnes sold the "Evening Journal" to Stephen Carlton Clark, after which he retired and lived in Armonk. He died at his home in Armonk on June 25, 1930, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery.
Early life.
William Barnes was born in Albany, New York on November 17, 1866, the son of William Barnes Sr. (1824-1913) and Emily Peck Weed (1827-1889). His father was an attorney who helped organize the first New York State convention of the new Republican Party in 1854, and served as state Insurance Commissioner from 1860 to 1870, the first person to hold the position after it was created. Emily Weed was the daughter of Thurlow Weed, a prominent newspaper publisher and the longtime head of New York State's Whig Party, who was also a founder of the Republican Party. The younger Barnes was an 1884 graduate of The Albany Academy, and an 1888 graduate of Harvard University.
Early career.
Barnes worked briefly as a newspaper reporter for the "Albany Evening Journal" before purchasing the "Albany Morning Express", of which he was publisher and editor. In 1889, he purchased the "Evening Journal", of which he was also editor and publisher. During years when Republicans were in control of New York state's government, Barnes' publishing business was frequently selected to print official works, including the reports of government agencies and state government directories.
In addition to his newspaper career, Barnes became active in New York politics as a leader of the Republican Party. In 1891, he became head of the party in both the city and in Albany County, and in 1894 Republican Oren E. Owen won the mayor's office. This victory brought about Republican dominance in Albany, and Barnes went on to serve as a member of the New York Republican State Committee from 1892 to 1914.
Continued career.
As an ally of Thomas C. Platt, Barnes became a major figure in Republican politics at the national level, and supported successive Republican presidents William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, and William Howard Taft. His prominence led to his appointment as the U.S. Surveyor of Customs for the Port of Albany, a lucrative position Barnes held from 1899 to 1911.
Barnes was a delegate to the Republican National Conventions of 1904, 1908, and 1912, and chairman of the state Republican Committee from 1911 to 1914. From 1912 to 1916, Barnes was a member of the Republican National Committee. In 1915, he was a delegate to the New York state constitutional convention.
Incumbent President Taft was a candidate for reelection in 1912. Former President Roosevelt, an advocate for a more active presidency and more liberal policies than Taft, opposed him for the Republican nomination. Barnes was a leader of the party's conservative wing, and was a key player in obtaining the nomination for Taft. In response, Roosevelt's supporters left the party, and Roosevelt ran as the candidate of the newly-organized Progressive Party. The Republican Party split between conservative Taft supporters and Progressive followers of Roosevelt, which enabled the election of the Democratic nominee, Woodrow Wilson.
Later career.
In a July 1914 editorial, Roosevelt accused Barnes of being a corrupt party boss who conspired with Charles Francis Murphy, the leader of the Democratic Tammany Hall organization, to block progressive reforms in New York. In response, Barnes sued Roosevelt for libel. Roosevelt argued that he was not liable because the charges he made were true, and the 1915 trial with a verdict in Roosevelt's favor.
For several years after the trial, Barnes lived in New York City while maintaining his voting residence in Albany, and he began to be opposed within the city and county Republican Parties. In his later years, his conservatism manifested itself as opposition to the selection of nominees for office by direct primary election, women's suffrage, and organized labor. In 1921, the Democratic organization led by Daniel P. O'Connell nominated William Stormont Hackett for mayor. Hackett won the election, defeating Republican William Van Rensselaer Erving, a Barnes loyalist who had served as the city's public safety commissioner and won the Republican nomination by defeating an anti-Barnes insurgency. Hackett's win ended Barnes' dominance over Albany city and county politics and ushered in more than 50 years of control by O'Connell's organization.
Retirement and death.
In 1925, Barnes sold the "Evening Journal" to Stephen Carlton Clark, after which he retired and lived in Armonk. He died at his home in Armonk on June 25, 1930, and was buried at Albany Rural Cemetery, Section 109, Lot 3.
Family.
On June 12, 1888, Barnes married Grace Davis of Cincinnati, Ohio. Their children included sons Thurlow Weed Barnes (1889-1976) and Landon Barnes (1894-1964). William and Grace Barnes divorced in 1922, and in 1923 he married Maude (Fiero) Battershall, who died in 1929.
Barnes' siblings included Thurlow Weed Barnes (1853-1918), an 1876 Harvard graduate who was active in New York's Republican Party and worked for the "Albany Evening Journal". He authored a biography of Thurlow Weed, and later became a world traveler and international businessman with railroad and mining interests primarily in China. In addition, Barnes's sister Catherine Weed Barnes was a well-known photographer.

Ephraim Weston Clark

Ephraim Weston Clark (July 25, 1799 – July 15, 1878) is most remembered for his decades of work helping to translate the Bible into the Hawaiian language, and his subsequent work on the 1868 revision of the translation. He was the third Kahu (pastor) of Kawaiahaʻo Church in Honolulu, and served in that position 15 years. His early years as a missionary were spent on the Hawaiian island of Maui; while serving as Kahu of Kawaiahaʻo, he also spent several months with the Hawaiian Missionary Society in Micronesia.
Family background.
He was born in Haverhill, New Hampshire to Edward Clark and Elizabeth Weston, but the family soon relocated to Peacham, Vermont where he grew up. Decades after his death, "The Friend" periodical put together his biography based on unpublished writings he had begun during the last year of his life. In his notes, Clark had described his father as a soldier with the Marquis de Lafayette during the Siege of Yorktown, and his mother's father Ephraim Weston as a soldier in the "French War of 1775" (possibly referring to the Siege of Fort St. Jean).
Preparing for the ministry.
While a teenager working in Stanstead, Canada, he attended a local Congregational Church and was inspired to train for the ministry. He completed his studies at Peacham Academy in Vermont, and graduated from Dartmouth College in 1824. Clark did post-graduate studies in theology at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He was ordained into the ministry on October 3, 1827, by the Rev. Jonathan Smith Green, with whom he would work throughout much of his life.
Hawaii.
Ephraim Clark and his wife Mary Kittredge were part of the Third Company of missionaries sent to the Kingdom of Hawaii by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Rev. Jonathan Green and his wife Asenath Cargill Spring were also part of the same company of missionaries. The sea voyage aboard the "Parthian" began November 3, 1828, and took 148 days, during which the missionary passengers lived in cramped roach-infested quarters, with inadequate eating utensils. Most of the missionary couples had only been married a matter of weeks before embarking on the voyage. Ephraim and Mary had been married a few days short of 6 weeks when they boarded the "Parthian". The other two missionary couples in this company were Lorrin Andrews and his wife Mary Ann Wilson, and Peter Johnson Gulick and his wife Fanny Hinckley Thomas. In addition to the missionaries and their wives, four unmarried women were included as household assistants for the wives once they arrived in Hawaii.The ship docked in Honolulu on March 30, 1829.
The Clarks were initially assigned to Honolulu, ministering to non-Hawaiians, primarily sailors and non-resident visitors to the islands. Clark was sent to assist Lorrin Andrews at Lahainaluna mission station in 1834. According to his biographical notes in "The Friend", he took a five-month health sabbatical from his work in 1839. During this period, he recuperated with friends in the missionary fields of China. He received a call in 1843 to be pastor to a Hawaiian congregation in Wailuku on Maui.
Clark was called to be Kahu (pastor) of Kawaiahaʻo Church in 1848, to succeed Richard Armstrong who had been appointed Minister of Public Instruction. The current Kawaiahaʻo Church was constructed between 1836 and 1842. When Clark started, the structure was known as "the First Native Church at Kawaihao in Honolulu". The church as a body of believers had existed since Hiram Bingham arrived in 1820, and began meetings adjacent to his thatched hut. Other replacement structures were built in the same location before the stone church was erected, and had been a church home for royalty since Queen Kaʻahumanu accepted Christianity in 1824. Other names for the church have included "the Stone Church", "First Native Hawaiian church" and "the Mission Church".
As Secretary of the Hawaiian Missionary Society, that position required an absence from the Kawaiahaʻo pulpit for several months in 1852, assisting the Society's efforts at establishing mission stations in Micronesia. It was in 1853, during Rev. Clark's tenure that "the First Native Church at Kawaihao in Honolulu" became "Kawaiahaʻo Church". His wife Mary died while he was Kahu of the church.
Queen Victoria had already consented to be the godmother of four-year-old Crown Prince of the Kingdom of Hawaii Albert Kamehameha, in a ceremony conducted by an Episcopalian bishop. Before the bishop could arrive for that to take place, the prince fell ill in August 1862, and his health progressively declined. Even though Clark was a Congregational minister, the child's parents Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma arranged for him to perform the Episcopalian ceremony. The service was held on August 23, with the newly arrived British commissioner William Webb Follett Synge and his wife as stand-ins for Queen Victoria. The young prince died four days later.
Hawaiian language translations.
When he resigned as Kahu of Kawaiahaʻo Church in 1868, Clark was president of the committee to revise the Hawaiian language translation of the Bible. His second wife Sarah Helen Richards became his assistant in the revision. He had been involved with the original translation project for decades, and had made trips to the mainland United States in 1856, 1859 and 1864 to meet with printers.
The translation of the Old Testament from the original Hebrew and Aramaic, and the New Testament from ancient Greek, had been an ongoing project begun in 1824 by Hiram Bingham, William Richards, Artemas Bishop, and Asa Thurston. Over the years, the project came to include the Royal Governor of Hawaii Kuakini and Hawaiian scholars Samuel Kamakau, John Papa ʻĪʻī and David Malo. Missionaries Jonathan Smith Green, Lorrin Andrews, Sheldon Dibble and Clark came on board in 1830. The translation of the New Testament was published in 1832, with Queen Kaʻahumanu receiving the first copy. Translation of the Old Testament was published in 1839, as was a translated text of the Bible.
Other translations Clark was involved with include "First Lessons in Astronomy", text-books on geometry, trigonometry, and surveying, and the children's book "The Little Philosopher".
Personal life and final years.
On September 27, 1827, Clark wed Mary Kittredge of Mont Vernon, New Hampshire. They were the parents of eight children. After she died on August 14, 1857, he married Sarah Helen Richards of Norwich, Vermont on September 13, 1859. According to information provided by him, his second wife was the widow of Rev. Thomas Hall, and was quite accomplished in her own right with a 10-year tenure as Kimball Union Academy principal. In later years, they moved to Chicago to be near their children. Ephraim died July 16, 1878, and Sarah died August 12, 1887.

Ramesh Balwani

Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani (born June 13, 1965) is an American businessman who is the former president and chief operating officer of Theranos, which was a privately held health technology company founded by his then-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes. Theranos claimed to have devised a revolutionary blood test that used very small amounts of blood such as that which can be extracted from a fingerstick. Starting in 2015, Theranos came under criticism in the media due to its questionable claims and practices. The company was eventually forced into bankruptcy. Balwani was charged by federal authorities for operating the business as a multi-million-dollar scheme to defraud investors, doctors, and patients. A trial was set to begin in October 2020, but has been pushed back to January 11, 2022 (for Balwani) due to COVID-19 concerns.
Early life and education.
Ramesh Balwani was born in Pakistan to a Sindhi Hindu family. The family moved to India, and later immigrated to the United States. 
In 1986 Balwani began undergraduate studies at the University of Texas at Austin where he was a member of the Pakistani Students Association. He received an undergraduate degree in information systems.
Career.
Balwani worked for Lotus Software and Microsoft before 1998, when he helped to create CommerceBid, a software development company that helped businesses buy and sell items over the burgeoning Internet. In 1999, the company was purchased by Commerce One, another business development software company with a high valuation. The buyout was done entirely with stock, and Balwani joined the board of the new company. In July 2000, Balwani sold his shares in Commerce One, netting nearly $40 million shortly before the company went out of business, just before the dot com bubble burst. He later went back to school and received a Master of Business Administration from the University of California, Berkeley in 2003. He spent another four years in a computer science graduate program at Stanford University, but dropped out in 2008.
While enrolled at Berkeley, Balwani, who was 37 at the time, met Elizabeth Holmes, who was 18 and in her senior year of high school. Holmes pursued an undergraduate degree in chemical engineering at Stanford, but later dropped out to focus full-time on Theranos.
Theranos.
Balwani joined Theranos in 2009. He ran the company's day-to-day operations as its president. He had no training in biological sciences or medical devices, which became an issue due to the absence of medical experts on the company's board of directors and Balwani's behavior. He was described by former Theranos employees as overbearing, uncompromising and so concerned about industrial espionage that he verged on paranoia.
Within Theranos, Balwani was known for using technical terms he seemingly did not understand in what others believed were attempts to appear more knowledgeable. Balwani at one point claimed: "This invention [the Edison blood testing device] is going to be way up there, um, with-- with the discovery of antibiotics." He once misheard "end effector" (the claw or other device at the end of an automated robot's arm) as "endofactor" (a nonsense word) and repeated the error throughout a meeting, furthermore not noticing when "Endofactor" was subsequently used as a prank in a PowerPoint presentation.
"The Wall Street Journal" reported in October 2015 that the Edison blood testing device by Theranos produced inaccurate medical diagnoses and results. Edison machines frequently failed quality-control checks and produced widely varying results, a finding that was corroborated in a report released in March 2016 by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In April 2016, Theranos told regulators it had voided all test results from Edison machines for 2014 and 2015, as well as some other tests it ran on conventional machines.
In January 2016, the CMS sent a warning letter to Theranos after inspecting its Newark, California, laboratory. CMS regulators proposed a two-year ban on Balwani from owning or operating a blood lab after the company had not fixed problems within its California lab in March 2016.
The other charges of fraud against Theranos include claiming the company's technology was being used by the U.S. Department of Defense in combat situations despite never having been used.
Another false claim included claiming a $100 million revenue stream in 2014 that was actually $100,000.
Legal proceedings.
SEC fraud charges.
In March 2018, Balwani and Holmes were charged by the SEC with securities fraud, "raising more than $700 million from investors through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company's technology, business, and financial performance". Holmes settled the case out of court without admitting or denying wrongdoing, but Balwani is still in litigation as of 2019. He says he is innocent of the charges.
Criminal charges.
On June 15, 2018, following an investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco that lasted more than two years, a federal grand jury indicted president Ramesh "Sunny" Balwani and Elizabeth Holmes on nine counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Prosecutors allege that Holmes and Balwani engaged in two criminal schemes, one to defraud investors, the other to defraud doctors and patients. In June 2019 a U.S. District Court judge ordered Balwani and Holmes to stand trial beginning in July 2020. In March 2020, a U.S. District Court Judge ordered that Balwani will stand trial separately from Holmes. A March 17, 2021 order set Holmes's trial to begin August 31, 2021. Balwani's trial will begin after the conclusion of Holmes's in January 2022. Balwani's attorneys were expected to argue that he never made any money for his work at Theranos.
Personal life.
He was married to Japanese artist Keiko Fujimoto. Fujimoto and Balwani lived in San Francisco before their divorce in December 2002.
Balwani was in a romantic relationship with Elizabeth Holmes during his tenure at Theranos. Holmes met him in 2002 at age 18, while still in school. He was 19 years older than Holmes and married at the time. Their relationship was not disclosed to their Theranos investors.

Puszka Pandory

Puszka Pandory (English: Pandora's Box) is a Polish computer text game created in 1986 by for the ZX Spectrum computer. The game achieved popularity after trading on the Grzybowska Commodity Exchange (including trade from a lot of pirates, which were rampant in the country at the time due to a Communist approach to copyright).
The first version of the game was written in BASIC, and was wiped after the tape was accidentally placed into a tape recorder. Borkowski lost enthusiasm for the game and didn't have a second attempt. He returned to the project in 1986 when house sitting for a friend.
The text compression on the ZX Spectrum computer (due to the fact that it only had 48 kilobytes of memory) imposed many restrictions on programmers, and the game was created as a challenge to see if these restrictions could be bypassed.
According to the book "Polish Bytes", the game is the first one written by a Pole, attempted to be sold in Poland, and whose description appeared in the Polish press. Bajtek's review of the game is notable for being the first extensive description of a Polish video game in the media. However, Borkowski actually wrote the review himself, under the anagram pseudonym "Karol B. Mirowski".
Legacy.
On the game's 25th anniversary, 100 limited edition copies were released at the Poznań Game Arena, with each copy signed by Marcin Borkowski. The games worked on the ZX Spectrum.

Swedish Army Ordnance Corps

The Swedish Army Ordnance Corps (, Ftk) was an administrative corps of the Swedish Army established in 1937 (its first instruction on 18 June 1937). The majority of the active officers and some civilian personnel served in the Ordnance Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration and its workshops.
History.
The corps was established on 1 July 1937 through a merger of the artillery factories and the staff of the Ordnance Depot ("Tyganstalten") with "Fortifikationen" and the Swedish Army Service Troops' ordnance services as well as with the military units' ordnance officers and ordnance non-commissioned officers. The new administrative corps was named the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps ("Fälttygkåren") and with the Master-General of the Ordnance as its head. The Master-General of the Ordnance had been the head of the Artillery Department of the Royal Swedish Army Materiel Administration, whose artillery staff officers and clerks also belonged to the corps. This corps thus consisted of both officers, non-commissioned officers and civilians. The military unit's weapons artisans remained outside the corps.
In 1973, the Swedish Army Ordnance Corps was amalgamated with the Quartermaster Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces into the Commissary Corps of the Swedish Armed Forces.

Fourth inauguration of Vladimir Putin

The Fourth inauguration of Vladimir Putin as the President of Russia took place on Monday, 7 May 2018, in the Hall of the Order of St. Andrew of the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow. The inauguration marked the commencement of the new six-year term of Vladimir Putin as President of Russia. The presidential oath of office was administered to Putin by Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin. In addition, in the Presidium of the ceremony, according to tradition, was the leaders of the legislature: Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko and Chairman of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
Background.
Presidential election were held on 18 March 2018. Eight candidates participated in the election. Vladimir Putin won the election in the first round, gaining more than 76% of the votes.
Vladimir Putin, who was elected as President in 2012, was eligible to run, which he declared his intent to do so on 6 December 2017, being widely expected to win. This came following several months of speculation, throughout the second half of 2017, as although he was widely expected to run for another term, Putin made evasive comments including that he had still not decided whether he would like to "step down" from the post of president, that he would "think about running", and that he "hadn't yet decided whether to run for another term".
Different sources predicted that he would run as an independent to capitalize more support from the population, and although he could also have been nominated by the United Russia party as in 2012, Putin chose to run as an independent.
Planning.
Place of the ceremony.
On 19 April it became known that Vladimir Putin was offered two options for the inauguration ceremony.
The first, the traditional option, was to hold the event as before in the Grand Kremlin Palace. The second option assumed that for the first time in history the inauguration would take place outdoors on one of the Central squares of Moscow. In particular, it was proposed to hold a ceremony on Ivanovskaya Square, which is located inside the Kremlin, or on Red Square. However, according to the presidential press secretary Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin is not inclined to change the venue of the ceremony, and the inauguration is likely to take place traditionally in the Grand Kremlin Palace.
It is worth noting that a similar idea existed at the time of 1996 inauguration of Boris Yeltsin. Then it was supposed to hold a ceremony on Cathedral Square, but then this idea was abandoned in order to save money, and the ceremony was held in the State Kremlin Palace.
Presidential car.
The inauguration used the publicly presented at first time new Russian-made "Aurus Senat" limousine, instead of the current Mercedes-Benz S 600 Guard Pullman.
Although, before the inauguration, it was reported that this car will not be used during the ceremony, as did not like the Director of the ceremony. Instead, it was supposed to use the old Mercedes Pullman.
Pre-inaugural events.
Presentation of the certificate of the President of Russia.
On 3 April 2018, the Chairwoman of the Central Election Commission Ella Pamfilova handed Vladimir Putin the certificate of the President of Russia for the next term. Presenting the certificate in early April, Ella Pamfilova violated the tradition by which the certificate was always handed when the President took office (not earlier than 6 May).
In addition, Pamfilova also congratulated Putin on a confident victory. The President-elect responded by thanking her and her colleagues who worked during the election campaign. He noted that it was a great national work, very important for the country, it was carried out at the highest technical and organizational level. And these elections were the most transparent and clean in the history of the country.
Inaugural events.
Ceremony.
The ceremony began at a quarter to 12 Moscow time, when in St Andrew's hall was made a Russian Flag and the Presidential Standard. Following them, the chain of office and a special copy of the Russian Constitution were introduced.
After the introduction of the Flag and Symbols of the President, the Chairwoman of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko, Chairman of the state Duma Vyacheslav Volodin and Chairman of the constitutional Court Valery Zorkin were invited to the stage.
At that time, Vladimir Putin left his office in the Kremlin Senate and went to the Grand Kremlin Palace. When moving, the Cortege automobile was first used.
At noon Vladimir Putin arrived at The Grand Kremlin Palace, where he went through the Alexander and St. George Halls and climbed the stage in the St. Andrew's Hall.
After Vladimir Putin took the stage, Chairman of the Constitutional Court Valery Zorkin urged Putin to take the oath. According to Article 82 of the Russian Constitution, Vladimir Putin took the oath to the people of Russia in the presence of Federation Council members, members of the State Duma and judges of the Russian Constitutional Court. Vladimir Putin took the oath of office, traditionally with his right hand on the Constitution. After Putin took the oath, Zorkin said that Vladimir Putin had officially taken office as President of Russia. After the swearing-in, orchestra performed Anthem of Russia, the presidential standard rose above the Senate Palace and Putin received the traditional 30-gun salute in his honor.
Inaugural address.
Vladimir Putin then delivered his 12-minute inaugural address of 1,246 words. This speech was the longest in history, the previous record was the inaugural speech of Boris Yeltsin in 1991, that speech consisted of 748 words.
In his speech, Vladimir Putin thanked Russian citizens for the trust and support they had given him in the election. Putin spoke about the tasks that need to be solved, as they will determine the fate of Russia for decades to come. Also, Putin called the priority tasks of the state, namely improving the quality of education and health care, as well as the protection of motherhood and childhood. In his speech, Putin told about plans for a new term, he promised to do everything to increase the strength, prosperity and glory of Russia. In the speech, Putin noted that for more than thousand years of history, Russia has repeatedly faced periods of turmoil and trials, comparing Russia with the Phoenix: "For more than a thousand years the history of Russia repeatedly faced periods of turmoil and trials and always, always reborn, like a Phoenix, has reached such heights that others had not, were considered inaccessible, and for our country, on the contrary, become a new springboard, a new historic milestone for the future, a strong push forward."
Parade.
After the main part of the inauguration ceremony, Vladimir Putin went to Cathedral square, where he conducted a review of the troops of the Kremlin Regiment. The review of troops will mark the inauguration of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Russia. During the parade, Putin congratulated the regiment on the 82nd anniversary, as on the same day, 7 May, the regiment celebrates the anniversary of its foundation.
After the parade, Vladimir Putin spoke with volunteers and representatives of youth organisations who were invited to the inauguration.
Post-ceremony events.
Prayer service.
After the inauguration ceremony, Putin went to the Cathedral of the Annunciation, at the entrance to which Patriarch Kirill was waiting for him. They went inside together for worship.
The prayer contains a request that God give entrants the President the strength and wisdom to run the country, creating it the world and a good organization. At the end of the prayer, Patriarch Kirill read a prayer that always sounds at this service.
After that, the Patriarch addressed Putin on behalf of the clergy, monastics and faithful. He noted that all these people supported Putin, seeing him as a leader, not only successfully managing the state, but also a person devoted to the Fatherland, for which the spiritual tradition is his own tradition, for which both material and spiritual well-being of people is the task of fulfilling the presidential term."
The Patriarch wished the President good health and strength to fulfil all the promises made in his inaugural speech.

Ecopipo is a Mexican manufacturer of cloth diapers headquartered in Irapuato. Ixchel Anaya Meave started the business while a student in 2009 and subsequently incorporated it with her husband.
Anaya was studying interior design in 2009 when she wanted to buy reusable cloth diapers to save on the cost of disposables and because her son developed a skin reaction to them. Finding none made in Mexico, she designed and made her own with her grandmother's help. She began selling them to friends, and then incorporated Ecopipo with her husband. In 2011 she placed first in the national contest to represent Mexico at the Global Student Entrepreneur Awards.
The company's name is a combination of "Eco-" for "ecological" and "Pipo", the name of a teddy bear handed down in Anaya's family. The diapers use Velcro instead of safety pins and consist of a waterproof outer layer, a polyester fleece inner layer, and inserts made from bamboo. In addition to being available in different sizes, they stretch to fit the baby. They are produced in a factory in Irapuato and in a subcontracted facility in Xalapa to satisfy export demand. 
Eighty percent of sales are within Mexico, where the company sells through a network of about 300 user-distributors. Most orders are via the internet, and Ecopipo exports to Canada, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, and the European Union; Anaya's aunt Laura Finnegan, who lives in Northern Ireland, is its European representative. the company produces approximately 4,000 diapers a month, and , has annual sales of $1.3 million. It is in the top five suppliers of reusable diapers in the United Kingdom. The company has branched out into swimming diapers, training pants, diaper bags, blankets, bibs, and reusable menstrual pads, all of which made up 15% of its sales in 2017.

The painting came into possession of the Faesch Museum founded by Remigius Faesch who was married with Rosa Irmi, a granddaughter of Jakob Meyer zum Hasen. It was exhibited in the Museum Faesch until 1823, today both panels are exhibited in the Kunstmuseum Basel.

Open access in France

In France, open access to scholarly communication is relatively robust and has strong public support. Revues.org, a digital platform for social science and humanities publications, launched in 1999. Hyper Articles en Ligne (HAL) began in 2001. The French National Center for Scientific Research participated in 2003 in the creation of the influential Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in the Sciences and Humanities. Publishers EDP Sciences and belong to the international Open Access Scholarly Publishers Association.
Open Repositories.
There are a number of collections of scholarship in France housed in digital open access repositories. They contain journal articles, book chapters, data, and other research outputs that are free to read.
The main open repository platform in use for French higher education and research institutions is HAL. It hosts over 520 000 fulltext documents and about 1.5 million references. More than 120 institutions have opened their own institutional portals on the HAL platform.
Open access publishing.
France's main actor in open access publishing is Openedition. This set of publishing platforms is specialized in Human and Social Sciences. It hosts 490 journals, 5,600+ books, 2,600+ blogs and 39,000 events. Openedition is operated by an institutional unit called CLEO, and funded by the Centre national de la recherche scientifique, Ecole des hautes etudes en sciences sociales, Université d'Aix-Marseille, and Université d'Avignon et des Pays de Vaucluse. It uses for books and journals a "freemium" business model: most content is available in HTML format for free, and the other formats (pdf, epub) are available to the subscribed institutions.
Timeline.

Army Foundation College recruit abuse investigation 2014–2018

The Army Foundation College recruit abuse investigation 2014–2018 was a response to allegations from a group of 17-year-old British army recruits that 17 instructors had maltreated them during their training over nine days in June 2014. It was reported as the British army's largest ever investigation of abuse. Among the allegations were that the instructors assaulted recruits, smeared cattle dung into their mouths, and held their heads under water. The accused were initially charged with 40 counts of battery, actual bodily harm, and other offences; all denied the charges made against them.
Charges against seven of the accused were dropped by the time of the preliminary hearing on 21 September 2017. The court martial began with the remaining ten accused on 12 February 2018. The hearing was expected to last four weeks, but soon collapsed after the judge ruled that the Royal Military Police (RMP) had abused the investigatory process and that a fair trial would therefore not be possible. Specifically, the judge criticised the investigation as 'seriously flawed': the RMP had failed to interview several key witnesses, took two years to arrest the accused for questioning under caution, and took three years to bring the case to trial. All the accused were released without further charges.
Background.
The British army enlists new recruits from age 16. Recruits aged between 16 and 17.5 years, known as Junior Soldiers (JS), undergo 12 months of initial training based at the Army Foundation College in Harrogate, Yorkshire. Towards the end of this period, recruits destined for the infantry travel to battle camp in Kirkcudbright, Dumfries and Galloway, which includes bayonet practice. Infantry recruits then complete their training at the Infantry Training Centre in Catterick, Yorkshire.
Allegations of abuse at the Army Foundation College have been common. Between 2014 and 2020, recruits made 60 formal complaints of assault or ill-treatment.
Allegations and charges.
Among the initial allegations reported in the "Mail on Sunday" on 12 August 2017 were that seventeen instructors from the Army Foundation College, having taken their trainees to battle camp in Kirkcudbright, had pushed cow dung into the recruits' mouths, held their heads under water, and kicked and punched them repeatedly during bayonet training. The recruits concerned were aged 17; the instructors were all corporals or sergeants, and included veterans of the Afghanistan War and Iraq War.
The instructors faced 40 charges of battery, actual bodily harm and other ill-treatment. All the accused denied any wrongdoing.
Court martial.
By the time of the preliminary hearing of 21 September 2017, charges against seven of the accused had been dropped, leaving ten defendants to face 25 counts of ill-treatment and six of battery. All defendants entered not-guilty pleas.
The trial began on 12 February 2018 at Bulford Military Court Centre with Assistant Judge Advocate General Alan Large presiding. After the opening prosecution arguments, the defence applied to have the proceedings stayed as an abuse of process, meaning that the allegations were not investigated and brought to court in proper order. The judge agreed and, describing the investigation as 'seriously flawed' and 'totally blinkered', criticised the military police for failing to interview key witnesses and taking too long to bring the case to trial. On grounds that the defendants could no longer be fairly tried, the judge stayed the case and all defendants were released.
Timeline.
The following chronology is summarised from the legal judgement.
Reaction.
The collapse of the case was reported on the BBC ITV, STV, and in the "Guardian", "Mirror", "Northern Echo", "Telegraph", "Times," "Yorkshire Evening Post", and "Yorkshire Post".
Lewis Cherry, a defence lawyer at the court martial interviewed for the BBC said he was 'appalled' by the failure of the military police to conduct its investigation in proper order, and said his clients would be 'relieved that the nightmare of these false allegations hanging over them for many years is over'.
Human rights campaigners argued that the 'multiple failures' that led to the case collapsing showed that the military should not be entrusted to administer its own justice. The campaign group ForcesWatch said that the case's collapse meant that 'serious allegations of abuse against some of the army's youngest recruits have gone untested'.
The Ministry of Defence announced an internal review.

Ninja (gamer)

Richard Tyler Blevins (born June 5, 1991), better known by his online alias Ninja, is an American Twitch streamer, YouTuber and professional gamer.
Blevins began in streaming through participating in several esports teams in competitive play for "Halo 3", and gradually picked up fame when he first started playing "Fortnite Battle Royale" in late 2017. Blevins's rise among mainstream media began in March 2018 when he played "Fortnite" together with Drake, Travis Scott and JuJu Smith-Schuster on stream, breaking a peak viewer count record on Twitch. Blevins has over 16 million followers, making him the most-followed Twitch channel as of June 2021.
Early life.
Richard Tyler Blevins was born on June 5, 1991, to American parents of Welsh descent. Though born in the Detroit area, he moved with his family to the Chicago suburbs when he was an infant. He attended Grayslake Central High School, where he played soccer. Upon graduation, he decided to play video games professionally, entering tournaments, joining professional organizations, and live streaming his games.
Career.
Esports and streaming.
Blevins began playing "Halo 3" professionally in 2009. He played for various organizations including Cloud9, Renegades, Team Liquid, and most recently, Luminosity Gaming. Blevins became a streamer in 2011. He began playing "H1Z1", then moved to "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds". He joined Luminosity Gaming in 2017 first as a "Halo" player, then to "H1Z1", later moving to "PUBG", where he won the "PUBG" Gamescom Invitational Squads classification in August 2017.
Blevins began streaming the newly released "Fortnite Battle Royale" shortly after the "PUBG" Gamescom Invitational. His viewership began to grow, which coincided with the game's growth in popularity over the late 2017/early 2018 period. His followers on Twitch had grown from 500,000 in September 2017 to over 2 million by March 2018.
In March 2018, Blevins set the Twitch record for the largest concurrent audience on an individual stream (outside of tournament events), 635,000, while playing "Fortnite" with Drake, Travis Scott, and JuJu Smith-Schuster. This stream inspired Epic Games, the developers behind "Fortnite", to host a charitable pro-am event featuring popular streamers like Blevins paired with famous celebrities in "Fortnite" at E3 2018 in June of that year; Blevins paired with electronic musician Marshmello and won the event. In April 2018, he broke his own viewing record during his event "Ninja Vegas 2018", where he accumulated an audience of about 667,000 live viewers.
Blevins partnered with Red Bull Esports in June 2018, and held a special "Fortnite" event, the Red Bull Rise Till Dawn in Chicago on July 21, 2018, where players could challenge him.
Blevins' rise in popularity on Twitch is considered to be synergistically tied to the success of "Fortnite Battle Royale". In December 2018, Blevins estimated he had made close to in 2018, while Epic Games reported they had earned over in revenue in the year, primarily due to "Fortnite". To acknowledge Blevins' importance to "Fortnite"s success, Epic added a Ninja-based cosmetic skin to the game in January 2020 as the first part of an "Icon Series" for other real-life personalities associated with "Fortnite".
Reuters reported that Blevins had been paid by Electronic Arts to promote "Apex Legends", a competing battle royale game to "Fortnite", for playing the game on his Twitch stream and promoting the title through social media account during "Apex" release in February 2019.
On August 1, 2019, Blevins left Twitch to stream exclusively on Microsoft's Mixer platform. His wife and manager Jessica told "The Verge" that the contract with Twitch had limited the ability for Ninja to grow his brand outside of video gaming, and that because of the state of Twitch's community, "it really seemed like he was kind of losing himself and his love for streaming."
In addition to a large number of subscribers on Twitch and Mixer, Blevins has over 24 million subscribers on YouTube as of April 2021. At the time, he was earning over $500,000 per month from streaming "Fortnite" and credits the game's free-to-play business model as a growth factor.
Due to the shutdown of Mixer in July 2020, Blevins was released from his exclusivity deal, enabling him to stream on other platforms. On September 10, 2020, Blevins revealed that he would return to streaming on Twitch after signing an exclusive multiyear deal and streamed on the platform the same day.
Other appearances.
Blevins and his family were featured in several episodes of the television game show "Family Feud" in 2015. In an episode aired August 2019, after he had achieved his fame, his family returned as contestants on "Celebrity Family Feud".
In September 2018, Blevins became the first professional esports player to be featured on the cover of "ESPN The Magazine", marking a breakthrough into mainstream sports fame.
Blevins worked with the record label Astralwerks in October 2018 to compile an album titled "Ninjawerks: Vol. 1" featuring original songs by electronic music acts. The album was released on December 14, 2018.
Blevins was one of several Internet celebrities featured in "". Blevins appeared briefly during the NFL's "The 100-Year Game" ad alongside numerous several professional football players that aired during Super Bowl LIII in 2019. He was the only participant in the commercial with no ties whatsoever to football in any form.
Blevins has released several books with publishing house Random House. Random House imprint, Clarkson Potter, published "Get Good: My Ultimate Guide to Gaming" on August 20, 2019.
Blevins participated in the second season of the Fox reality music competition "The Masked Singer" as "Ice Cream". He was voted out after his first performance to Devo's "Whip It" and Lil Nas X's "Old Town Road" and thus forced to unmasked. In an interview with "Entertainment Weekly", Blevins said that he accepted an invitation to participate since his wife was a fan of the show.
Charitable work.
In a fundraising charity stream held in February 2018, Blevins raised over $110,000 to be donated to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. During the first "Fortnite Battle Royale" Esports event in April 2018, Blevins gave away nearly $50,000 in prize money, with $2,500 of that going to the Alzheimer's Association. Later in April, he participated in the #Clips4Kids event with other fellow streamers DrLupo and TimTheTatman, and in total, he helped raise over $340,000. At E3 2018, Blevins and Marshmello won the Fortnite Pro-Am event which resulted in the donation of the $1 million prize to a charity of their choice.
Controversies.
Blevins has stated that he does not stream with female gamers out of respect for his wife and to avoid the rumors that such streaming could create. He received mixed reactions; some said that he should set an example and not make it more difficult for female streamers to rise to prominence, while others supported his stance, claiming that he should be allowed to do what he wants to protect his marriage. In response to his critics, Blevins has reaffirmed his support for gender equality and restated his commitment to his marriage, and mentioned some prominent female streamers by name. He has also made clear that women are welcome to play with him in a group or at events, saying that such situations allow him to "control the narrative more, without stupid drama and rumors flooding into our lives."
In December 2016, Blevins released the address of a donor as retribution for having a racist screen name and donation message. This act, which is referred to as "doxing", is against the Twitch rules, which states they can result in an "indefinite suspension". Blevins was reported for this act, but only received a 48-hour suspension, which some believed was a result of Blevins' large audience on the platform. Blevins later tweeted that he deserved the punishment.
In March 2018, while in a stream with Nadeshot, Blevins improvized the word "nigga" while rapping to Logic's "44 More,” a song in which the word was never actually said. This sparked controversy within his watching community and the general public. He later apologized for any offense caused and stated that he did not intend to say the word, instead attributing his use of the word to being "tongue-tied".
In October 2018, Blevins reported a player for "having a higher ping" than him. This led to a player claiming on November 16, 2018, that they had been banned as a result of the report, which Epic Games denied. Both of these incidents caused backlash against Blevins on social media.
In November 2018, Blevins received criticism for falsely reporting IcyFive, a "Fortnite" player, for stream sniping. After Blevins was eliminated by IcyFive, Blevins' teammate, DrLupo, told him to watch for an "emote", which IcyFive did perform. Blevins took this as proof that IcyFive was stream sniping and quickly reported the player. After reporting IcyFive, Blevins stated that he would "go out of his way" to ensure IcyFive got banned and told IcyFive that he would not report him if he left the game immediately, despite already having reported him. As IcyFive was not viewing the stream, he did not do so. Blevins assumed IcyFive was ignoring him and took out his phone in what appeared to be an attempt at directly contacting Epic Games. IcyFive claimed that he did not stream snipe Blevins and uploaded a video as proof. DrLupo later stated that he did not believe IcyFive stream sniped Blevins, mentioning that using an emote was a regular reaction to an increase in spectator count after elimination, and also stated that he did not condone Blevins' actions, comparing them to a rant. Blevins later apologized to IcyFive on Twitter but also accused the player of "playing the victim" and "milking" the incident, calling him "naive" for assuming players would be banned solely on his word.

Polypodium

Polypodium is a genus of ferns in the family Polypodiaceae, subfamily Polypodioideae, according to the Pteridophyte Phylogeny Group classification of 2016 (PPG I). The genus is widely distributed throughout the world, with the highest species diversity in the tropics. The name is derived from Ancient Greek "poly" (πολύ) "many" + "podion" (πόδιον) "little foot", on account of the foot-like appearance of the rhizome and its branches. They are commonly called polypodies or rockcap ferns, but for many species unique vernacular names exist.
They are terrestrial or epiphytic ferns, with a creeping, densely hairy or scaly rhizome bearing fronds at intervals along its length. The species differ in size and general appearance and in the character of the fronds, which are evergreen, persisting for 1–2 years, pinnate or pinnatifid (rarely simple entire), and from 10–80 cm or more long. The sori or groups of spore-cases (sporangia) are borne on the back of the frond; they are globose and naked, not covered with a membrane (indusium).
Polypodies have some use in herbalism, but are today most important in horticulture where several species, hybrids, and their cultivars like "Polypodium" 'Green Wave' are commonly used as ornamental plants for shady locations. "Polypodium" have a bitter-sweet taste and are among the rather few ferns that are used in cooking; in this case as a spice e.g. for nougat.

A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo

A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo is a 2018 children's book written by Jill Twiss and illustrated by EG Keller (a pseudonym of Gerald Kelley). The book is about a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, the real-life pet rabbit of former Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, and details the same-sex romance between Marlon Bundo and another rabbit named Wesley. It is a loose parody of "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President", another children's book featuring Marlon Bundo written by Charlotte Pence and illustrated by Karen Pence.
The book and its LGBTQ-inclusive theme was written by Jill Twiss (with Marlon Bundo credited as co-writer), who is a comedy writer for the television show "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver", aiming to deride Vice President Pence over his controversial anti-LGBTQ views, such as his alleged support for conversion therapy of gay adolescents and opposition to same-sex marriage. It was released on March 18, 2018, one day before the release of "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President". The audiobook version features Jim Parsons, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jeff Garlin, Ellie Kemper, John Lithgow, Jack McBrayer, and RuPaul. Alli Brydon, a freelance children's book editor, worked as a consultant and editor. The book was designed by Andrea Miller.
On the day of release, John Oliver promoted the book on "Last Week Tonight" at the conclusion of an episode mainly dedicated to Pence and his positions on LGBTQ issues; it became a bestseller and the No. 1 book and e-book on Amazon the following day. Oliver announced profits from the book were to be donated to The Trevor Project and AIDS United.
Background.
"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" was conceptualized as a loose parody of "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President," a children's book written by Mike Pence's daughter Charlotte Pence and illustrated by his wife Karen Pence. Their book also tells about a fictionalized day of the Pence family's pet rabbit, but without the LGBTQ themes of "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo". Writer Jill Twiss stated she became interested in Bundo due to his name. Once she learned about the upcoming book she stated, "we thought we could use the opportunity to support some really great charities while also hopefully putting out an inclusive, loving children's book in the process." Helped by input from the whole writing staff of "Last Week Tonight", Twiss' work was done in a few months, faster than the normal picture book process.
On March 18, 2018, the publication of both books was used as a comedy piece on "Last Week Tonight" to raise awareness of Mike Pence's stated anti-LGBTQ attitudes. John Oliver stated that Pence's pet rabbit was the one thing he liked about Pence, and that because of this, he had taken issue with the real-life Marlon Bundo having to make a stop at the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family during an upcoming promotional book tour with the Pences. With the Pences' book scheduled to appear on March 19, Oliver announced the publication of a "better Bundo book" at that very moment (so preceding the Pences' book).
According to the publisher, "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" is an actual children's story "about marriage equality and democracy", rather than a "straight-up" parody of the Pences' book. Twiss added that she hoped the book would resonate with children "feeling out of place or having a family that looks different than that of their friends". It nevertheless contains some stabs at Mike Pence, with the Marlon Bundo character claiming that Pence "isn't very fun" and a stink bug character sporting a white hairdo looking like Pence's.
Oliver acquired two domain names to promote "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo". According to Oliver, the domain betterbundobook.com contrasts the book with the Pence-family-written Bundo book and focusonthefurmily.com satirizes the anti-LGBTQ organization Focus on the Family.
In the March 18 broadcast, Oliver said that aside from sending an inclusive message, he was hoping to annoy Pence over the competition for his family's book and the fact that "Last Week Tonight" is donating all proceeds of its book to LGBTQ-friendly organizations (The Trevor Project and AIDS United).
Plot.
Marlon Bundo, a black-and-white rabbit sporting a colorful bow tie, lives in the home of "Grampa", vice president Mike Pence. Marlon is lonely, but one morning after breakfast, he meets Wesley, a bespectacled brown rabbit. They spend the day together, hopping around in the garden and the house. They decide to get married, because they never want to hop without each other again.
Marlon and Wesley tell their animal friends, who respond enthusiastically. But the stink bug, who is "In Charge and Important" (and bears a striking resemblance to Mike Pence, with white hair and a suit and tie), yells at them that boy rabbits can only marry girl rabbits. He calls them different, and he says that different is bad. The other animals speak up and tell him how each of them is different in their own way. They decide to vote on who is In Charge and Important, and the stink bug is voted out. Marlon and Wesley have their wedding, with their friends in attendance. They go to sleep in anticipation of their "bunnymoon".
Analysis.
"A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" was created as a parody with LGBTQ themes intertwined with the plot. John Oliver and his team wanted to mock the Vice President but they also wanted to create a children's book that has humor for kids who have no political interest. This book was a gesture to Mike Pence against his homophobic beliefs. Jill Twiss said in an interview that her ambition for the book was to make a heartfelt story and also annoy Pence. The message that went along with the sales of the book was that "different is special". Children who do feel out of place may have a hard time handling that. Twiss was hoping for a bit of satisfaction or contentment for those kids when reading about two same-sex bunnies marrying each other. The book takes a position against laws and actions against LGBTQ rights. These themes consist of respect, approval, and equality. This children's book is a way to show young people that "love is forever and be proud of who you are". The book is a presentation to delve into LGBTQ relationships and that "true love will always win out".
Publication.
One day after its release, the book overtook James Comey's book "A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership" to become the No. 1 book on Amazon. The book sold out on Amazon and the publishing company of the book said it was hurrying to print 760,000 more copies. For three weeks "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" was on the "New York Times" Children's Picture Books Bestsellers List. The book was once number one on that list, while the original book "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President" written by Charlotte Pence was seventh of the same list. It also topped the e-book sales, thus making the two versions of the book No. 1 and No. 2 on overall Amazon book sales, with the printed edition selling the most of the two. "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" sold much better than the Pence book it parodied, which was ranked eleventh in book sales on Amazon on its first day, climbing to No. 4 later in the week. In the first two days, 180,000 copies were sold. "Last Week Tonight" had not anticipated a large demand and the printed version sold out after two days. While it was being reprinted, it remained possible to order the book on Amazon and it continued to be available as an e-book version for Amazon Kindle and its various platforms. , the audiobook version with voice acting from Jim Parsons, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Jeff Garlin, Ellie Kemper, John Lithgow, Jack McBrayer and RuPaul was No. 1 on Audible. The book's distributor reported to have 150,000 books on back order three days before it was scheduled to be available in stores on March 23. On March 28, publisher Chronicle Books reported to have over 400,000 copies in print. Independent booksellers expressed disappointment with Chronicle Books for its handling of the book's launch, making it available via Amazon prior to supplying other retailers.
Reception.
Public response.
The publication sparked large numbers of reviews and comments on Amazon. These were overwhelmingly positive, though only about a third of the reviews were left by actual buyers of the book. On its launch date, a number of one star reviews with negative comments were left on the page of the Pences' book by non-buyers who favored the Twiss book, while Pence fans counteracted with five-star reviews on his book. Later that day, it was no longer possible to review the Pences' book without purchasing it and one star ratings from non-buyers had been removed.
News about the book and the controversy it stirred up was picked up by mainstream news outlets in the U.S. and all over the world.
In a segment on the book on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show", Ellen DeGeneres praised it and presented John Oliver with a $10,000 check from HBO for The Trevor Project, calling on her viewers to buy the book in support of the project. "Will &amp; Grace" creator Max Mutchnick donated a copy of the book to every elementary school in Indiana, saying he wanted to counter Pence's "message of intolerance" about gay people, hoping to "provide positive role models and a story of inclusion for children in Pence's home state".
Focus on the Family called Oliver's treatment of the Pences' book "not just vicious in tone, but also vulgar and vile in every sense of the word and way".
According to the American Library Association, the book was the 19th most banned and challenged book in the United States between 2010 and 2019, meaning it was requested for removal from various library collections on several occasions. The book ranked in the Top Ten Most Challenged Books in 2018 (2) and 2019 (3). The book was challenged due to its LGBTQIA+ content, for "its effect on any young people who would read it," for concerns that it was sexually explicit and biased, as well as its political and religious viewpoints.
Reaction from Charlotte Pence and Regnery Publishing.
Charlotte Pence, Mike Pence's daughter and the author of "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President", supported "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo". She posted on Twitter a picture of herself and the real-life Marlon Bundo wearing a bow tie identical to the one in Jill Twiss' book and said in a television interview: "His book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind... I'm all for it." The official Instagram of Marlon Bundo also spoke of Twiss' book in a positive light, stating "Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity." The proceeds from the Pences' book were also given to charities, namely The A21 Campaign which works to fight human trafficking and Tracy's Kids, an art therapy program for hospitalized children.
Regnery Publishing, the conservative book publisher who published the Pence book, initially criticized the release of "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo", saying that it was "unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan". When the success of both books became apparent, Regnery congratulated John Oliver and Chronicle Books with their sales figures, stating: "There's plenty to go around for everyone and, like Charlotte [Pence] said, we can all be happy the proceeds are going to a good cause."
Critical reviews.
Common Sense Media gave the book a four star rating and considers it appropriate for children of four years and older, giving it its highest marks for "positive messages" and "positive role models and representations". Susie Wilde of "The News &amp; Observer" noted that Twiss "understands how to tell a simple story with comic touches and pacing, creating a parody that children might actually enjoy", while Keller's "details are playful and give a strong sense of motion, which works well for the two rabbit heroes who never want to hop without each other." Katy Waldman in "The New Yorker" called the book "full of the attentive details and poetic grace notes that distinguish good children's books", while noting its "subtextual treats for adults". "Kirkus Reviews" calls the book "another tiresome political picture", that really just aims at older people and not for the age the book was supposed to be for. The review also notes that the book is good for a little laughter but not for a message intended for inclusion. However, "The Globe and Mail" Anna Fitzpatrick wrote that "while an unabashed political parody, it also stands on its own as a children's book".

Production.
Given the open ending of the first "Home Sweet Home" the audience had been very eager to know what happens with John &amp; Raj. The director and producer would get bombarded with similar questions wherever they went. This was a time when The then Chief Minister of Goa, Mr Manohar Parrikar was appointed as the Defence Minister of India and Goa was witnessing political instability. Clubbing this scenario with the first film's plot Swapnil came up with basic storyline for the sequel. The sequel was readied within a year from release of the first film.

St Lawrence Church, Lechlade

The Anglican St Lawrence Church, dedicated to St. Lawrence of Rome, is the Church of England parish church of Lechlade in Gloucestershire, England. The church building is Grade I listed and is described with admiration in Simon Jenkins's "England’s Thousand Best Churches".
The current church was built on the site of an earlier one and was completed in 1476. The roof and parts of the structure were replaced following a fire in the early 16th century. Various refurbishments have been undertaken since, including the installation of a gallery in 1740. Percy Bysshe Shelley composed a poem afer visiting the churchyard in 1815.
The church is notable for its eight-sided spire above the tower. The internal fixtures and fittings include a brass chandelier, 13th century piscina and carvings including the figure of the martyrdom of St Agatha.
History.
A church is known inferentially to have existed in Lechlade since at least 1210 when a fair was granted on St. Lawrence's day.
The present wool church replaced an earlier structure in 1476, funded by the dissolution of Lechlade Priory and local townspeople. The dedication of the church was originally to St Mary but changed in 1510 by Katherine of Aragon.
The nave roof and clerestory, the north porch, and the tower and spire may have been added in the early 16th century following a fire in 1510. A west gallery for singers was installed in 1740 and there were further internal additions in the 1880s.
Literature.
In September 1815 Percy Bysshe Shelley visited Lechlade with his future wife Mary, her step-brother Charles Clairmont, and the novelist Thomas Love Peacock, and was moved to compose a poem, "A Summer-Evening Churchyard, Lechlade, Gloucestershire", which was published the following year. The path through the churchyard is now named “Shelley’s Walk”, in a tribute to the famous atheist.
Community.
The Vicar is Dr Andrew Cinnamond.
The church has strong links with the nearby St Lawrence Church of England Primary School.
The parish of Lechlade is part of the South Cotswold Team Ministry benefice within the Diocese of Gloucester.
Architecture.
The church is of dressed freestone from Taynton Quarry near Burford. It consists of a nave with clerestorey, four-bay aisles, north porch, north and south chancel chapels and chancel with a vestry on the north side. The three-stage west tower is supported by diagonal buttresses and topped with angle pinnacles, embattled parapet and an eight-sided spire. The bells in the tower are of various ages; the oldest of which is from 1590. The peal was rehung in 1911 when a new treble added, and again in 1966.
Fittings and fixtures.
Some of the fittings including the 13th century piscina, font and the figure of St Agatha in the north aisle are from the earlier church on the site. St Agatha is sculpted with a sword through her naked breasts depicting the nature of her martyrdom. The brass chandelier hanging from the ceiling is from 1730, and is inscribed "the gift of Mr Richard Ainge". The pulpit was added in 1882 but the base on which it stands is much older and was found in the vicarage garden.
There are some medieval brasses and marble monuments. Under the stained glass east window is a wooden reredos with a carving of Agnus Dei.
Graveyard.
The graveyard is now closed for burials, with modern burials taking place in the town cemetery, but it includes many gravestones dating back hundreds of years. Chest tombs include those to William Hobbs, Ann Lambert, William Giles, Sarah Pace, Henry Yeatman, Thomas and John Walker, William Gearing, Mary Sophia Matthews, Thomas Hipsley, Mary Anne Walker, John Raven, William and Elizabeth Hobbs, Thomas Andrews, John Taylor, William and Thomas Hall and multiple unidentified monuments.

Polypodium (animal)

Polypodium is a genus of cnidarians that parasitizes in the eggs of sturgeon and similar fishes (Acipenseridae and Polyodontidae). It is one of the few metazoans (animals) that live inside the cells of other animals.
Polypodium hydriforme Ussov is the only species of this monotypic genus. The parent family (Polypodiidae), order (Polypodiidea) and class (Polypodiozoa) are also monotypic.
Taxonomy.
Unusual characteristics have led to much controversy regarding the phylogenetic position of "Polypodium" within metazoans.
"Polypodium" has traditionally been considered a cnidarian because it possesses nematocysts, the stinging structures characteristic of this phylum. Molecular phylogenetic studies using 18S rDNA sequence data temporarily challenged this interpretation, by finding that "Polypodium" is a close relative to myxozoans and suggesting that together they share a closer affinity to bilaterians than cnidarians. Due to the variable rates of 18S rDNA sequences, these results were however suggested to be an artifact of long branch attraction, and myxozoans have in the meantime, also been classified within cnidarians.
Evans et al. (2008) performed phylogenetic analyses of metazoans with 18S and partial 28S rDNA sequences in a large dataset that includes "Polypodium" and a comprehensive sampling of cnidarian taxa. This supports the placement of "Polypodium" within Cnidaria. This accords with its traditional classification, in particular with the fact that "Polypodium" possesses nematocysts and a cnidarian-like body plan. Myxozoans are currently classified as cnidarians as well.
Description and life cycle.
"Polypodium" was discovered in 1871 by prof. Owsiannikov within the eggs of sterlet ("Acipenser ruthenus") from the Volga river in Russia. In 1885  Ussov named  Owsiannikov's "parasitic larva" "Polypodium hydriforme" and gave a morphological description of the parasite.  "Polypodium" was long considered an unique endocellular parasite among cnidarians. Its hosts include 14 species of "Acipenser", 2 species of "Huso", "Polyodon spathula" and "Scaphirhynchus platorynchus". 
"Polypodium hydriforme" is an endocellular parasite with an unusual life cycle, a peculiar morphology, and high rates of DNA evolution. "Polypodium" spends most of its life inside the oocytes of acipenseriform fishes. In infected oocytes, "Polypodium" develops from a binucleate cell into an inside-out planuliform larva and then into an elongate inside-out stolon; the epidermal cell layer is located internal to the body and the gastrodermis is located externally. The embryo, larva and stolon are surrounded by a protective polyploid cell, which also functions in digestion. Just prior to host spawning, "Polypodium" everts to the normal position of cell layers, revealing tentacles scattered along the stolon. During eversion, the yolk of the host oocyte fills the gastral cavities of the parasite, supplying the future free-living stage with nutrients. The parasitic phase of its life cycle usually takes several years. Finally, upon emerging from the host egg in fresh water, the free-living stolon fragments into individual medusoid-like organisms that go on to multiply by means of longitudinal fission. In summer they form endodermal sexual organs: "female" ones showing ovaria and gonoducts, and "male" ones with simpler organization. "Female" gonads are supposedly abortive; the "male" ones ultimately produce binucleate cells and become gametophores which infect host fish. "Polypodium hydriforme" displays many pecuiliar characteristics, some of them shared with Myxozoa.
Habitat.
The habitat of "Polypodium hydriforme" is freshwater.
Although the fresh water habitat of "Polypodium" is unusual for cnidarians, it is not unheard of, especially within hydrozoans. For instance, the model organism "Hydra" and the jellyfish "Craspedacusta sowerbii" are both exclusively fresh-water hydrozoans. "Hydra" and "Craspedacusta sowerbii" are distantly related and they are not closely related to "Polypodium". Also, the obligate parasite "Myxobolus cerebralis" lives in freshwater. Thus, it appears that in the evolution of cnidarians, invasion to fresh-water habitats has happened at least three separate times.

Mózgprocesor is a Polish video game created in 1989, and published in 1990 by Computer Adventure Studio for ZX Spectrum and the Atari 8-bit family (1991). It was Computer Adventure Studio first and last game. It was created by ex-Atari alumni Piotr Kucharski, Krzysztof Piwowarski and Wiesław Florek. The team had previously created Smok Wawelski in 1987. The script was created within an hour and the whole game was ready after six weeks, without professional graphic programs or documentation. Reviews of the title were featured in Bajtek 10/1998 and Top Secret 1/1990, Top Secret 2/1990 also included an interview with the developers, which at the time was unprecedented for a Polish game.
Despite the title's massive popularity in Poland, the game was readily pirated which significantly eroded the profits of the young development company and prevented it from releasing a second title. According to Techsty, it is the most discussed and most developed of all the Polish text-based adventure games. Gadzetomania thought the title was probably the first, Polish game published in a professional way. Logo24 deemed it the first Polish game that did not differ significantly from global standards.

Regina Vicarino

Regina Vicarino (August 23, 1885 — 1957) was an American soprano opera singer.
Early life.
Reine Annette Vicarino was born in New York City, the daughter of Edouard Joseph Vicarino and Leontine Camille Serre Vicarino. Her father was born in Switzerland; her mother was born in New York, to French-born parents. Reine (who used the Italian form of her name, Regina) studied voice with Delia Valeri, and with Arthur Lawrason in New York.
Career.
Vicarino's voice was described as having "all the range and limpidity of an ideal coloratura," in the "Los Angeles Herald" in 1910; the critic went into further detail, writing that "The upper register is clear and brilliant, and the lower tones are wonderfully vibrant and rich for a coloratura voice." She frequently sang the lead role in Donizetti's "Lucia di Lammermoor", and she was also considered successful as Violetta in "La traviata", and as Micaela in "Carmen".
She sang with the Bevani Grand Opera Company in San Francisco in 1910. In the 1917-1918 season she toured New England and Canada with the Giuseppe Creatore Grand Opera Company. In 1921, she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall, performed in the summer "Zoo Grand Opera" productions in Cincinnati, Ohio, and she toured cities in the western United States and Canada with the San Carlo Opera Company. In 1922 she appeared in a radio production of Mozart's "The Impresario". She made recordings for Lyric Records, and for others under the pseudonym "Josepha Donnelli".
Later in her career, she taught voice privately and at Sullins College, Brenau College, and Arlington Hall. In 1935 and 1937, she appeared at the Mazica Hall in Miami, Florida, giving "operalogues".
Personal life.
Regina Vicarino married businessman George Vest Guyer in 1912. They had a daughter, Regina "Mimi" Vicarino Guyer, born in 1916. George died suddenly in 1922. Regina Vicarino died in 1957, aged 71.

Enrico Cavalli

Enrico Cavalli (5 November 1849 – 28 February 1919) was an Italian post-impressionist painter.
Biography.
Son of the painter Carlo Giuseppe Cavalli and Francesca Motta, he left Santa Maria Maggiore (Ossola Valley) for France when his family moved there in 1855. After spending the first three years in Grenoble, he lived for ten years in Lyon where he enrolled at the National Academy of Fine Arts. He took the courses taught by the master Joseph Guichard and made contact with other protagonists of the art scene such as François-Auguste Ravier, , and Jean Seignemartin. The outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War impelled the Cavalli family to move first to Paris, then to Marseille, where Enrico met and frequented Adolphe Monticelli, whose teachings on the subject of light and colour greatly influenced the young Italian painter. His pictorial production of this period remains largely unknown, however we do know that two portraits by Cavalli were accepted for the Paris Salon of 1881 and particularly admired by the critic of magazine .
The Cavalli family returned to Santa Maria Maggiore, where Carlo Giuseppe and Enrico taught at the local Rossetti Valentini Art School from 1881 until 1892. Enrico succeeded in stimulating and involving his students – who included the brilliant Carlo Fornara, Giovanni Battista Ciolina, Gian Maria Rastellini, and Lorenzo Peretti Junior – through the study of the great masters and practical experience "en plein air", according to the rules of modernity he had learnt in France.
Enrico Cavalli's teaching experience at the small academy in the Val Vigezzo was brusquely interrupted in 1892 by the death of his father, who officially held the position. The school's Administrative Commission announced a competition to replace Carlo Giuseppe Cavalli without taking into consideration the decade-long experience of his son, who abandoned the field in protest. Accompanied at first by Fornara and Peretti Junior, the former teacher left again for France, beginning a tormented journey that saw him wandering from place to place until, in 1901, he returned home to accept a temporary teaching post at the same Rossetti Valentini School, which nevertheless was not renewed at the end of the school year. There followed another fifteen years of commissioned works, restorations and private lessons in Italy and France. Only in 1917, with the support of some Santa Maria Maggiore notables, was the artist assigned a permanent teaching position at the Rossetti Valentini School, where he taught until his death.
In 1946, on the initiative of Carlo Fornara and arts patron Amedeo Catapano, a commemorative plaque was placed on the facade of the Rossetti Valentini School, its polemical tone aimed at those who had prevented Cavalli from succeeding his father as director of the school. Also in 1946, the Municipality of Santa Maria Maggiore dedicated the street, in which the School of Fine Arts is located, to Enrico Cavalli.

<doc id="56881767" url="?curid=56881767" title="Velhagen &amp; Klasing">
Velhagen &amp; Klasing

Velhagen &amp; Klasing was a major German publishing company in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
History.
Long nineteenth century.
Velhagen &amp; Klasing's first major success was the popular cookbook of Henriette Davidis from 1844–1875. The company earned 2,762 Thaler in the cookbook's peak sales year in 1858, or the equivalent of Davidis argued fiercely with the company over her compensation, and her royalty payment increased from 50 to 1000 Thaler over its publication history.
In the 1870s and 1880s, Velhagen &amp; Klasing sold two-thirds of its Lutheran and patriotic works through Colporteur salesmen, at the time a new method of marketing through door-to-door salesmen.
Another area that Velhagen &amp; Klasing emphasized was geography textbooks. In this area, , who published 's works, was their major competitor. In the mid-to-late 1800s, Hirt &amp; Sohn and Velhagen &amp; Klasing together had an oligopoly in the German textbook market. 
Velhagen &amp; Klasing was also dominant in popular children's literature.
Their popular novels for girls in this era conveyed largely the same values as their schoolbooks, namely virtue, piety, self-sacrifice, and docility.
In the late nineteenth century, Velhagen &amp; Klasing published a number of very popular adventure novels by S. Wörishöffer. She was hired by Velhagen &amp; Klasing to rewrite an unsuccessful novel by a previously unpublished writer, Max Bischoff, which resulted in "Robert des Schiffsjungen" (1877). The publisher intentionally hid the identity of Wörishöffer, who was not the world traveling male that the novels implied, in order to preserve their credibility.
In 1886, they began publishing the illustrated family monthly, "Velhagen &amp; Klasing's Monatshefte", which included reviews by Carl Hermann Busse.
In 1901, they bought the publishing company of Georg Wilhelm Ferdinand Müller (1806–1875) from his heirs. Müller's work consisted primarily of textbooks.
The publisher had significant involvement in the Leipzig Geographical Society, known as "Geographischer Abend".
After World War I.
When World War I caused a redrawing of national boundaries, some publishers, such as , began developing geographical maps which ignored territorial boundaries. Velhagen &amp; Klasing rejected this shift and focused on territorial boundaries.
Velhagen &amp; Klasing published the second most popular school atlas in Germany in the 1920s, after the one made by Carl Diercke.
Their atlases in this era were examples of cartographic propaganda intentionally designed to promote German nationalism, as had their other textbooks since the nineteenth century.
The trend to expand the borders of Germany and German cultural influence in Velhagen &amp; Klasing's maps began in the late 1920s, and by 1933 their maps contained large-scale falsifications.
Velhagen &amp; Klasing was one of many who profited from the closure of Jewish and left-wing publishing companies during the Nazi Party's rise to power in the 1930s.

Augsburg raid

The Augsburg Raid, also referred to as Operation Margin, was a bombing raid made by the RAF on the MAN U-boat engine plant in Augsburg undertaken during the daylight hours of 17 April 1942. The mission was assigned to No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron and No. 97 Squadron, both of which were equipped with the new Avro Lancaster. The speed of the Lancaster and its large bombload capacity gave reason for optimism that the raid might succeed. It was the first of the attacks upon German industry in Augsburg.
Background.
For Arthur Harris, RAF Bomber Command's commander-in-chief, the Augsburg raid was a gamble. He had assumed command some two months earlier, and had inherited a bankrupt concern that was on the ropes. Bomber Command had been attacking German industry at night for two years, and had little to show for it. Losses had been significant. The strain upon his command was high, and morale among his crews brittle. The costs of the bombing offensive both in terms of manpower and of scarce war materiel was great. A good deal of pressure was upon Harris to release aircraft to help the Royal Navy in the battle of the Atlantic against German U-boats, but he was not prepared to dissipate his strength, preferring to assist in the U-boat war by attacking the U-boats at their bases. The "Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nürnberg" (MAN) U-boat engine plant in Augsburg presented a different type of opportunity to address the U-boat problem. Harris believed striking this target would show his command was capable, and demonstrate his commitment to the anti-U-boat campaign.
The MAN plant produced half of all the U-boat engines built. Destroying this plant would greatly impede U-boat production. Among the difficulties for Bomber Command was that the factory was a fairly small target. Bomber Command’s night raids had not proven to be very accurate thus far. The target did not lend itself to area bombing from large formation attacks; to damage it required accuracy. In addition, the factory was located on the periphery of a city in Bavaria, southern Germany. To reach it would require flying nearly 600 miles over enemy occupied territory.
44 Squadron had been working with the Lancaster prototype since its arrival there in September, and had laid sea mines with the aircraft in March to gain some operational experience, but the Lancaster was still unknown to the Germans. This would be the aircraft's first major test. It would be an experimental raid which would take advantage of the speed, range and bombload of the Lancaster.
Planning.
It was hoped that a daylight raid would enable accurate bombing, whilst low level flight would mean that they would be undetected by radar and hopefully achieve surprise. Seven Lancasters from No 44 Squadron and seven from No 97 Squadron would practice long low level flights around Britain and make simulated raids on Inverness, Scotland as preparation for the raid. This training led many of the crews to speculate that their target would be the German naval facility at Kiel.
German fighter bases in the west were concentrated in northern France, Belgium and Germany. British fighter escorts could only protect the bombers for the first 200 miles of their journey; afterwards they would be on their own, unprotected. Since the bombers could not be escorted to the target it was decided to try to slip the Lancasters past the German defenders unnoticed. Fighter Command would put on a large diversionary circus operation. A "Ramrod" attack would be carried out by a force of 30 Douglas Boston medium bombers from No. 2 Group’s 88 and 107 Squadrons accompanied by a heavy fighter escort. One group of bombers would attack the port facilities at Cherbourg while a second group attacked the shipyard at Rouen to the east. Meanwhile, large "Rodeo" operations would be conducted to the north in the Pas de Calais. These diversionary attacks were intended to divert the German fighters away from the entry point for the Lancaster force, allowing them to get past the coast defences and into northern France. To avoid radar detection the Lancasters would fly at low altitude all the way to the target.
The bomber force was drawn from the two squadrons which had been issued the Lancaster: No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron and No. 97 Squadron. The aircraft would leave in the afternoon, cross northern France to Germany, make their attack as light faded, and then fly a direct return under the cover of darkness. 44 Squadron had the longest experience with the new aircraft, having received the prototype in September 1941. In command of the raid was Squadron Leader John Nettleton of 44 Squadron. A South African, he was an experienced pilot nearing the end of his first tour. 97 Squadron would be led by Squadron Leader John Sherwood.
Bomber Command crews were trained to fly on their own at altitude in trail and during the night. The crews were unfamiliar with low level flying, and they did not perform formation flying. A week before the operation the two squadrons were withdrawn from the bomber offensive and began training in low level formation flying. Each squadron would prepare seven Lancaster crews for the mission, but only six aircraft would go, with the seventh prepared as a spare.
For the mission each squadron would fly to the target in two flights of three. The Lancasters would carry four 1,000 pound high explosive bombs. The bombs were to be released just above roof top height at . They were therefore fused with 11 second delayed action fuses to give the aircraft time to get away from the target area before the bombs went off.
It was the first raid over enemy territory in the Lancaster, though crews from 44 Squadron had been working up in the aircraft for some time. Their previous aircraft had been the Handley Page Hampden medium bomber. The Lancaster was a much bigger, stronger aircraft, and it had much greater defensive fire power. From the 2-3 defensive guns of the Hampden, crews would now be fending off attacks with eight guns in three turrets.
The raid.
On 17 April 1942 eight Lancasters in each squadron were prepared for the mission. Their petrol tanks were filled to their maximum capacity of , and the aircraft were armed with four bombs. The crews were summoned to the briefing room, airfield security required them to present proof of their identities, and they were brought in to learn the details of the mission they had been training for. The target they were to fly to in daylight was more than 500 miles beyond the French coast, and that the target itself was a single building the size of a football pitch. Most of the crews were incredulous, but Patrick Dorehill, Nettleton's flight engineer for the raid, was confident in their new aircraft: "I thought six Lancasters, with all the armament we had, we would be a match for any fighter."
Seven Lancasters of 44 Squadron took off from RAF Waddington in mid-afternoon. Nettleton’s force formed into two sections of three aircraft plus a spare and headed south. Ten miles to the east at RAF Woodhall Spa, seven more Lancasters headed south, with Sherwood leading his two flights of three plus a spare. The two groups did not link up, which was not troubling to either group. They sky was clear and the weather warm. The 14 aircraft flew to Selsey Bill, a headland jutting into the Channel just east of Portsmouth that served as a prominent navigation point. At Selsey Bill the back-up Lancasters turned back to their airfield. The remaining aircraft flew on, as they crossed the coast they made a hard 90 degree turn to the left and dropped down to 50 feet to cross over the English Channel. Nettleton’s group were ahead flying slightly north of the intended flight path. Sherwood spotted Nettleton’s group as they approached the French coast, but Sherwood's navigator confirmed his position and course were correct, and he did not attempt to close the gap. They reached the French coast at Dives sur Mer while the diversionary operation was well underway. Flying under German radar, the 12 aircraft moved inland unnoticed. Nettleton’s group passed over Lisieux, where they came under anti-aircraft fire. Some aircraft were hit but no significant damage resulted. A little behind, Sherwood's group kept a flight path a little farther south.
As the two "vic" formations of 44 Squadron approached Evreux they passed just to the east of the French airfield at Beaumont-le-Roger, which was in use by JG 2. Unfortunately, through an error in orders issued to the Boston bombers and their escorts, the diversionary attacks had been run 40 minutes ahead of schedule. The German fighters that had been sent up to engage them were returning to base when Nettleton's aircraft passed by. For a moment the Lancaster crews thought they had gone unnoticed, but several German fighters were seen to snap up their undercarriages and veered in their direction.
As the German fighters caught up they attacked the trailing vic first. Warrant Officer Crum’s Lancaster on the left took machine gun and cannon fire. Bullets struck the cockpit's canopy, showering Crum and his navigator, Rhodesian Alan Dedman, with shards of Perspex. Dedman looked across at his pilot and saw blood streaming down his face, but when he reached over Crum just grinned at him and waved him away.
Some 20 to 30 fighters attempted to chase down Nettleton’s six Lancasters. Unfamiliar with the new aircraft type, the attacks were tentative at first, and the Lancasters closed up tighter. Soon the German pilots realized the defensive armament was limited to .303 machine guns, and they began to press home their attacks. They came in from the quarter, opening fire with 20 mm cannon at about before breaking off sharply at 400 yards, just beyond effective range of the defensive fire. Opposite Crum in the trailing vic Warrant Officer Beckett's aircraft took cannon strikes to his starboard wing root over the fuel tank, and a great ball of orange flame suddenly flared out. The bomber was soon a mass of fire and its nose tipped down. A moment later Beckett's Lancaster hit a clump of trees and disintegrated.
Next, Crum’s Lancaster was attacked again. Taking fire, both the rear and mid-upper gunners were wounded. Then the port wing fuel tank was hit and burst into flames. Crum, half blinded by the blood streaming from his face, fought to hold the wings level and ordered Dedman to jettison the bombs (which had not yet been armed). The 1000-pounders dropped away, and a few moments later Crum managed to put the crippled aircraft down on her belly. The Lancaster tore across a wheat field and came to a stop. The crew, badly shaken and bruised, broke all records in getting out of the wreck, convinced that it was going to explode in flames, but the fire in the wing went out. Crum was under orders not to allow his aircraft to fall into German hands. With an axe from the bomber’s escape kit, he cut holes in the fuel tanks and threw a match into the resulting pool of petrol. The wreck was soon completely ablaze. He and his crew then split up into pairs to attempt to escape occupied France along one of the aircrew escape lines through Bordeaux and Spain. They were all
caught by the Germans and spent the rest of the war in "Luftwaffe" prisoner of war camps.
Flight Lieutenant Sandford's aircraft was the last of the second section. Sandford was one of the most popular officers on No. 44 Squadron. In a bid to shed his pursuers he brought his bomber down to pass under a group of high tension cables. In doing so his right wingtip brushed the ground, causing the aircraft to cart-wheel and then explode. All were killed in the crash.
Now the pursuers moved up to the lead vic of aircraft. Warrant Officer "Dusty" Rhodes, flying to the right and some distance behind Nettleton, was attacked first. His Lancaster was hit by the "experte" Walter Oesau, commander of JG2, and soon engulfed in fire. The aircraft then pitched up into a steep climb, seeming to hang briefly on its churning propellers before falling over sharply and crashing into the ground. it was Oesau's 101st kill.
This left only Nettleton and Garwell. Both aircraft had suffered multiple hits, but no attempt to escape to the south was made. Nettleton was a determined flight leader. Then something unexpected happened. Without warning the enemy fighters suddenly broke off their attacks and turned away. Whether due to lack of fuel or lack of ammunition is not known, but it allowed the two surviving Lancasters to escape. Nettleton’s group had one more touch of bad luck as they flew over a German supply depot and faced heavy anti-aircraft fire. Luckily both aircraft came through unscathed, and they were not molested again until they were over the target.
Meanwhile, to the south Sherwood's group of six Lancasters from 97 Squadron had slipped by unseen. Both groups of aircraft continued south independently. They passed to the west of Paris and then turned east for their long trek across northern France, passing first over Sens. They received the occasional wave from a Frenchmen, but otherwise passed through the rest of the country unnoticed. Reaching Sens, they bent their path southeast and headed for the frontier, skirting along the Swiss border till they reached Lake Constance. Here they turned northeast on course for Munich till they came to a large lake known as the Ammersee. Here they made a hard turn to the north, headed over a rise and came into view of their target, Augsburg.
Their arrival at Augsburg did not go unnoticed. Nettleton's two aircraft arrived first, coming in low over the roof tops. Soon they were met with anti-aircraft fire of great intensity and accuracy. Though fired upon from point blank range they held course and delivered their bombs on the target. Pulling away, Garwell’s aircraft was hit in a fuel tank and set afire. Garwell brought it down and crash landed. Three of his crew died in the crash, but Garwell and three others survived.
Shortly after Nettleton's aircraft cleared the target came Sherwood’s two flights of three, up to this point unmolested by the German defenses. Sherwood had brought his formation across nearly 600 miles of enemy occupied territory at very low level, arriving directly on time upon the target. The plant was now marked by smoke from the initial attack. Going in at rooftop level in line astern, they released their bombs, then dropped to street level to get under the flak and out of town. Sherwood's aircraft was hit and caught on fire. He continued to lead his section away from the target with one wing well alight until suddenly the aircraft became uncontrollable, dropped a wing, flew straight into the ground and exploded.
In the second group all three pilots saw Sherwood go down before they made their attack. Warrant Officer Mycock's aircraft was hit in his run in and became engulfed in flames, but in a display of uncommon bravery and devotion to his task he pressed on and delivered his bombs on the target just before his aircraft exploded, killing everyone aboard. Flying Officer Deverill's aircraft was also hit and set afire. He released his bombs on the target as well. Soon after his crew controlled the fire, but his aircraft had suffered a ten-foot gash along its fuselage. He was able to form up with another 97 Squadron aircraft as darkness fell and the two returned to base together.
The 97 Squadron aircraft made it back to Woodhall Spa before Nettleton got to Waddington. Nettleton had returned in a badly damaged aircraft. Finally breaking radio silence they requested navigational assistance and learned they had flown out over the Irish Sea. Turning around they landed at Squire's Gate aerodrome, near Blackpool in North West England. Upon landing he telephoned Waddington to report on the mission and ask about survivors. Five aircraft had made it back. Of the 85 crewmen who had set out that afternoon, 49 were listed as missing.
Aftermath.
The raid had not ended well. 4 of the Lancasters in the 44 Squadron group were shot down over northern France, and another was lost over the target. Flak defenses at Augsburg claimed 2 more aircraft from 97 Squadron. Only 5 aircraft returned from the raid, a 58% loss rate. Of the five that got back, one was damaged beyond repair and had to be written off, while the others had all suffered significant damage as well. Surviving crews felt numb over the losses. They were given three days leave to help get their feet back under them. Nettleton then took his crew up to the Air Fighting Development Unit at Duxford to try to work out evasive tactics that could be used in the event of future fighter interceptions.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill said : “We must plainly regard the attack of the Lancasters on the U-boat engine factory at Augsburg as an outstanding achievement of the Royal Air Force. Undeterred by heavy losses at the outset, 44 and 97 Squadrons pierced and struck a vital point with deadly precision in broad daylight. Pray convey the thanks of His Majesty’s Government to the officers and men who accomplished this memorial feat of arms in which no life was lost in vain.”
Harris recommended both Nettleton and Sherwood for the Victoria Cross. Nettleton was gazetted for the award on 24 April 1942. He was the first South African of the war to win the VC. The Air Ministry declined to award Sherwood the VC, though they did offer to award him the DSO if it was discovered he had survived. To everyone's surprise, he had. When his aircraft hit the ground the pilot seat broke from its mounting and was thrown from the wreckage. Sherwood was still strapped in, and was the sole survivor from the crash. Many other officers and men who had survived the mission were awarded recognitions as well.
The raid was hailed by the Ministry of Information as a triumph, and was given widespread publicity in Britain. The surviving crews were put to use to encourage morale for the war effort. This did not set well with Nettleton, who felt responsible for the loss of so many crews, but he did what the government asked of him.
Though the MAN plant had been hit, its U-boat engine production continued. The crews believed they had destroyed their target, as they had seen their bombs strike the plant. In fact they had placed 17 1,000 pound bombs on the main tool shop, causing significant damage to the roof and walls, but the machine tools themselves were largely still functional. Only 12 of the 17 bombs that struck the tool shop detonated. The 29% failure rate was somewhat higher than the usual 20% failure rate that was typical of UK produced high explosive bombs. The bombing resulted in significant structural damage to the building housing the tool shop, but few of the tools inside were damaged. U-boat engine production continued without apparent disruption.
The Augsburg mission was the longest low level penetration raid ever undertaken during the Second World War. However, a loss rate of 58% was clearly unsustainable. The results indicated daylight attacks against defended targets were no more practical in 1942 than they had been in 1940. The failure of the raid was an impetus for Bomber Command to press forward with the formation of the Air Ministry’s proposed Target Finding Force. In addition, Bomber Command continued to attempt occasional daylight raids against small, high value targets.
Aviation historian Robert Owen has described the Augsburg Raid as one of the most audacious raids ever mounted. In terms of airmanship, courage, determination and skill, he considers the raid as one of Bomber Command's best examples.

Dr Disrespect

Herschel "Guy" Beahm IV, better known by his online alias Dr DisRespect, is an American video-game streamer.
Beahm had accumulated more than four million followers on Twitch, and is best known for playing battle royale video games, such as "H1Z1", "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds", ', ', "Apex Legends", and "Fortnite".
In June 2020, Beahm was banned from Twitch for unexplained reasons and his channel was removed from the site. Sources have reported that the ban is permanent. He returned to streaming in August 2020 on YouTube with a total peak of more than 510,000 concurrent viewers.
Career and personal life.
Beahm graduated from California State Polytechnic University, Pomona in 2005, where he played NCAA Division II basketball.
Beahm's first video was posted on January 11, 2010, showing gameplay of "". He was featured in multiple videos for the gaming channel Machinima, mostly playing "Call of Duty". Beahm went inactive from YouTube in late 2011 and did not release any content for nearly five years.
On March 16, 2011, Beahm was appointed as the community manager of Sledgehammer Games. He was promoted to level designer and helped create many of the multiplayer maps for "". Beahm joined Justin.tv (now Twitch) while he was working at Sledgehammer. He quit Sledgehammer in 2015 to focus on a full-time streaming career.
Beahm gained a following from playing battle royale games, starting with "H1Z1" before switching to "PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds" and then moving on to "". In December 2017, he took a two-month hiatus from streaming to tend to his relationship with his wife, after having admitted to being unfaithful to her. Beahm and his wife have a daughter. He returned on February 5, 2018, with a total peak of 388,000 concurrent viewers, just shy of beating Tyler1's record of 410,000. His popularity has led to sponsorship deals with Gillette, ASUS, Roccat and Game Fuel.
According to Beahm, on September 11, 2018, an unknown person shot at his house with a BB gun and hit an upstairs window. This was reportedly the second time that someone shot at his house.
On January 10, 2019, Creative Artists Agency signed Beahm as a client.
Beahm signed a multi-year deal with Twitch in March 2020.
On August 17, 2020, Beahm announced that he was writing a personal memoir called "Violence. Speed. Momentum." This book was released to the public on March 30, 2021.
Streaming persona.
Beahm's on-stream persona is usually ruthless, quick-witted, and bombastic. He is often regarded as an entertainer in the streaming industry, rather than a "professional gamer." ESPN describes him as "a WWE character in the competitive gaming world", and he himself has said "I created a character who plays multiplayer video games, and he's considered the most dominating gaming specimen."
When playing the Dr Disrespect character, Beahm wears a black mullet wig, sunglasses, a red or black long-sleeved athletic moisture-wicking shirt, and a red or black tactical vest. He sports a mustache he has named "Slick Daddy" aka "The Poisonous Ethiopian Caterpillar".
Controversies.
E3 bathroom filming incident.
On June 11, 2019, Beahm's DrDisrespect Twitch channel was suspended as he was livestreaming while attending the 2019 edition of the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles, California. Beahm and his cameraman went into a public restroom (Beahm re-entered the bathroom on two occasions, with filming still going on) at the venue in violation of Twitch's privacy rules and privacy laws in the California Penal Code. In addition, E3 organizer Entertainment Software Association revoked Beahm's E3 pass, banning him from the event. Twitch reinstated the DrDisrespect channel on June 25.
Racism accusation.
Musician Jimmy Wong compiled a series of clips in which Beahm caricatures Chinese accents and language and accused him of racism. In response, Beahm claimed that some of his best friends are Asian and called the criticism "laughable".
Coronavirus conspiracy theories.
During a stream, Dr Disrespect shared two pieces of questionable coronavirus-related media, which cited rebutted analysis and 5G conspiracy. Neither during the stream nor afterwards did he distance himself, or the persona, from the positive attitude shown to these pieces. The gaming blog Kotaku commented:
Permanent ban from Twitch.
On June 26, 2020, the DrDisRespect Twitch account was banned from Twitch. Twitch's official statement on the ban said "As is our process, we take appropriate action when we have evidence that a streamer has acted in violation of our Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. These apply to all streamers regardless of status or prominence in the community". No specific details have been released. On June 27, Beahm tweeted that he had not yet been informed on the exact reason for the ban. On July 16, 20 days after he was banned, he broke his silence and was interviewed by "PC Gamer" and "The Washington Post"; insisting that he still does not know why Twitch banned him from the platform, that his contracts were still in good standing, debunks any "crazy speculation" or theory that developed and is focusing on his upcoming "Doc 3.0" personality.
On August 6, after 42 days without streaming, he tweeted a link to his YouTube channel with the caption "Tomorrow, we arrive." He went live on YouTube at the same time, but the stream only showed a looping video of a custom Champions Club gas station. He also confirmed that he would show up on stream at 12:00PM PT on the following day. On August 7, DrDisrespect returned to his stream at 1 pm PDT. The reason for his ban has yet to be announced.
On August 23, 2021, DrDisrespect revealed that he has known "for months" the reason for his ban and his intentions to litigate due to suggested major damages.

<doc id="56882258" url="?curid=56882258" title="N-glycosyltransferase">
N-glycosyltransferase

"N"-glycosyltransferase is an enzyme in prokaryotes which transfers individual hexoses onto asparagine sidechains in substrate proteins, using a nucleotide-bound intermediary, within the cytoplasm. They are distinct from regular "N"-glycosylating enzymes, which are oligosaccharyltransferases that transfer pre-assembled oligosaccharides. Both enzyme families however target a shared amino acid sequence asparagine—-any amino acid except proline—serine or threonine (N–x–S/T), with some variations.
Such enzymes have been found in the bacteria "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" (whose "N"-glycosyltransferase is the best researched member of this enzyme family) and "Haemophilus influenzae", and later in other bacterial species such as "Escherichia coli". "N"-glycosyltransferases usually target adhesin proteins, which are involved in the attachment of bacterial cells to epithelia (in pathogenic bacteria); glycosylation is important for the stability and function of the adhesins.
History and definition.
"N"-glycosyltransferase activity was first discovered in 2003 by St. Geme "et al." in "Haemophilus influenzae" and identified as a novel type of glycosyltransferase in 2010. The "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" "N"-glycosyltransferase is the best researched enzyme of this family. Initially, protein glycosylation was considered to be a purely eukaryotic process before such processes were discovered in prokaryotes, including "N"-glycosyltransferases.
Biochemistry.
"N"-glycosyltransferases are an unusual type of glycosyltransferase which joins single hexoses to the target protein. Attachment of sugars to the nitrogen atom in an amide group — such as the amide group of an asparagine — requires an enzyme, as the electrons of the nitrogen are delocalized in a pi-electron system with the carbon of the amide. Several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation. Among these are a deprotonation of the amide, an interaction between a hydroxyl group in the substrate sequon with the amide (a theory which is supported by the fact that the glycosylation rates appear to increase with the basicity of the second amino acid in the sequon) and two interactions involving acidic amino acids in the enzyme with each hydrogen atom of the amide group. This mechanism is supported by x-ray structures and biochemical information about glycosylation processes; the interaction breaks the delocalization and allows the electrons of the nitrogen to perform a nucleophilic attack on the sugar substrate.
"N"-glycosyltransferases from "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" and "Haemophilus influenzae" use an asparagine-amino acid-serine or threonine sequences as target sequences, the same sequence used by oligosaccharyltransferases. The glutamine-469 residue in the "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" "N"-glycosyltransferase and its homologues in other "N"-glycosyltransferases is important for the selectivity of the enzyme. The enzyme activity is further influenced by the amino acids around the sequon, with beta-loop structures especially important. At least the "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" "N"-glycosyltransferase can also hydrolyze sugar-nucleotides in the absence of a substrate, a pattern frequently observed in glycosyltransferases, and some "N"-glycosyltransferases can attach additional hexoses on oxygen atoms of the protein-linked hexose. "N"-glycosylation by "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" HMW1C does not require metals, consistent with observations made on other GT41 family glycosyltransferases and a distinction from oligosaccharyltransferases.
Classification.
Structurally "N"-glycosyltransferases belong to the GT41 family of glycosyltransferases and resemble protein "O"-GlcNAc transferase, an eukaryotic enzyme with various nuclear, mitochondrial and cytosolic targets. Regular "N"-linked oligosaccharyltransferases belong to a different protein family, STT3. The "Haemophilus influenzae" "N"-glycosyltransferase has domains with homologies to glutathione "S"-transferase and glycogen synthase.
The "N"-glycosyltransferases are subdivided into two functional classes, the first (e.g several "Yersinia", "Escherichia coli" and "Burkholderia" sp.) is linked to trimeric autotransporter adhesins and the second has enzymes genomically linked to ribosome and carbohydrate metabolism associated proteins (e.g "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae", "Haemophilus ducreyi" and "Kingella kingae").
Functions.
"N"-linked glycosylation is an important process, especially in eukaryotes where over half of all proteins have "N"-linked sugars attached and where it is the most common form of glycosylation. The processes are also important in prokaryotes and archaeans. In animals for example protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum and several functions of the immune system are dependent on glycosylation.
The principal substrates of "N"-glycosyltransferases are adhesins. Adhesins are proteins that are used to colonize a surface, often a mucosal surface in the case of pathogenic bacteria. "N"-glycosyltransferase homologues have been found in pathogenic gammaproteobacteria, such as "Yersinia" and other pasteurellaceae. These homologues are very similar to the "Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae" enzyme and can glycosylate the "Haemophilus influenzae" HMW1A adhesin.
"N"-glycosyltransferases may be a novel glycoengineering tool, considering that they do not require a lipid carrier to perform their function. Glycosylation is important for the function of many proteins and the production of glycosylated proteins can be a challenge. Potential uses of glycoengineering tools include the creation of vaccines against protein-bound polysaccharides.

Dayton-Wright XO-3

The Dayton-Wright XO-3 was an aircraft project developed by Dayton-Wright in 1924.
Design and development.
A contemporary of the successful Douglas O-2, it was an orthodox two seat biplane, powered by a Wright T-3 V12 engine. The prototype, numbered 23-1254, built by Wright Aeronautical after the demise of Dayton-wright, was allocated the Wright field number P-376.
Operational history.
After trials at Wright Field the XO-3 was rejected and returned to Wright Aeronautical, where it saw service as an engine test-bed, primarily for the Wright R-1750 Cyclone, with the civil registration "X-1087". Officially it was named "Mohawk" by Wright, but unofficially it received the sobriquet "Iron Horse".

Shirt of Flame

The phrase Shirt of Flame refers either to a specific form of the poison dress trope in folklore, or to a particular type of clothing given to people about to face burning at the stake.
Pre-Christian usage.
Jason.
Creusa (daughter of Creon) drew the attentions and favor of the hero Jason, and in revenge the sorceress Medea gave her a shirt or dress to wear, which Medea had cursed to stick to her body and burn her to death.
They [Jason and Medea] went to Corinth, and lived there happily for ten years, till Creon, king of Corinth, betrothed his daughter Glauce to Jason, who married her and divorced Medea. But she invoked the gods by whom Jason had sworn, and after often upbraiding him with his ingratitude she sent the bride a robe steeped in poison, which when Glauce had put on, she was consumed with fierce fire along with her father, who went to her rescue.
Heracles.
Heracles, who was both a hero and god, was killed by the Shirt of Nessus, which was also a Shirt of Fire. Heracles used an arrow poisoned with the blood of a Lernaean Hydra to kill the Centaur Nessus. As he lay dying, Nessus told the wife of Heracles, Deianeira, that a shirt stained with his blood would insure the faithfulness of her husband. She gave the shirt, a chiton, to Heracles, and when he put it on, the poisoned shirt began to burn him so much, that he made his own funeral pyre and leaped upon it.
Arthurian legend.
According to legend, a cursed mantle was among the items used by Morgan Le Fey to attempt to kill King Arthur. 
The next morning there arrived a damsel at the Court with a message from Morgan le Fay, saying that she had sent the King her brother a rich mantle for a gift, covered with precious stones, and begged him to receive it and to forgive her in whatever she might have offended him. The King answered little, but the mantle pleased him, and he was about to throw it over his shoulders when the lady of the lake stepped forward, and begged that she might speak to him in private. 'What is it?' asked the King. 'Say on here, and fear nothing.' 'Sir,' said the lady, 'do not put on this mantle, or suffer your Knights to put it on, till the bringer of it has worn it in your presence.' 'Your words are wise,' answered the King, 'I will do as you counsel me. Damsel, I desire you to put on this mantle that you have brought me, so that I may see it.' 'Sir,' said she, 'it does not become me to wear a King's garment.' 'By my head,' cried Arthur, 'you shall wear it before I put it on my back, or on the back of any of my Knights,' and he signed to them to put it on her, and she fell down dead, burnt to ashes by the enchanted mantle. Then the King was filled with anger, more than he was before, that his sister should have dealt so wickedly by him.
Roman martyrs.
During the Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, many early Christians were executed by being doused with tar, pitch and oil, and set alight in Rome. According to Tacitus, the Roman Emperor Nero used Christians as human torches. As such, they martyrs wore the metaphorical "Shirt of Flame" as they were consumed.
Often they were stripped and forced to wear a Tunica molesta or "annoying shirt" that was impregnated with oil, that was also a "Shirt of Flame". "The tunica molesta, or flaming shirt, was commonly used to execute criminals in ancient Greece and Rome."
Roman Catholic.
In Roman Catholic countries such as France, Italy and Spain, heretics after their trial were confined until the execution. The shirt of flame in the auto-da-fe under the Inquisition also was worn at different times through the centuries. Often the outfit for those to be burned were funny hats, and a shirt or tabard with flames, and sometimes imps and demons, sewn upon them. These images were used to terrify the convicted heretics, as well to subject them to ridicule and abuse as they were paraded to the place of execution. 
In Spain, special clothing such as the sanbenito was worn as part of their penance. Often made of yellow or faded sackcloth, these shirts used special symbols, including the Cross of Saint Andrew, for the convicted. The humiliation of the shirt of flame outfit was part of the punishment, and also was used to warn others of the penalties of nonconformity in faith, speech and practice.
Heretics were often people who did not conform to church teachings or doctrine. Many of them remained Catholic in most of their beliefs, but felt that they had betrayed that church or strayed from the church's teachings. Unlike areas with larger Protestant communities, the heretics were shamed and humiliated, rather than seeing themselves as martyrs to the Protestant religion. The shirt of flame worn by these men and women was never a gown of pride or sacrifice, but of despair.
Biblical references.
The white gown or Shirt of Flame used by Protestant martyrs was modeled in part on the long white garments worn by the martyrs "of the great tribulation" in heaven, as mentioned in chapter seven of the Bible's Book of Revelation. "9 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands... 13 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they? 14 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me, These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb."
Protestant martyrs in England.
Under the "De heretico comburendo" of 1401, heretics in England would be executed by burning at the stake. Many Protestants were later sentenced to "death by burning" in 16th-century England because of their faith. A number of them were ministers to small congregations, who were arrested and tried for heresy. Sometimes, they were given a special "Shirt of Flame" to wear under their clothes. Then, just before their execution, they were stripped to their underclothes, which would be this special shirt. 
When he was sentenced to death by burning, John Bradford was give a special shirt by a Mrs. Marlet, for whom he had previously written a devotional work. This was a clean shirt that was sewn specifically for the burning, made in the style of a wedding shirt. "This clothing with a new shirt to wear at the stake became a common feature at the burnings, a way of signaling support for and honouring the victim, as though he were being dressed as a bridegroom for a wedding." Also, the ceremonial donning of the shirt of flame could be seen as similar to the priest donning his vestments, thus subverting Catholic ritual. "...and so the martyr might pray over and kiss the shirt before putting it on... underlining their oneness with Christ and the fact they were willing to die..."
In popular culture.
Oscar Wilde, in his letter "De Profundis," written from prison, writes: "The martyr in his shirt of flame may be looking on the face of God, but to him who is piling the faggots or loosening the logs for the blast the whole scene is no more than the slaying of an ox is to the butcher, or the felling of a tree is to the charcoal burner in the forest, or the fall of a flower to one who is mowing down the grass with a scythe."
T. S. Eliot, after his conversion to Anglicanism, wrote in "Little Gidding" (one of his "Four Quartets"): "Love is the unfamiliar Name / Behind the hands that wove / The intolerable shirt of flame / Which human power cannot remove."

Reception of Unaccompanied Minors from the Northern Triangle

The Northern American Triangle refers to the Central American countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.
Studies shows that the trend of unaccompanied migration from the Northern Triangle is strongly influenced by the poverty and violence of the sending countries. Given that these children are considered underage migrants, the manner in which the Department of Homeland Security and the United States in general receives them differs from that of adult migrants.
Background.
Section 462 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 defines an unaccompanied minor as a child who meets the following requirements:
"(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom— (i) there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide care and physical custody."
Between 2009 and 2014, U.S Customs and Border Protection saw a rise in the number of unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle being apprehended at the border; among these minors there was a 77% increase in girls and 117% increase children ages twelve and under. The Northern Triangle refers to the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, which since the late 20th century have undergone a series of crises and civil wars which the United States has intervened in. There has been a 120% increase in the number of children from Honduras, more than 100% increase in the number of children from El Salvador, and almost a 60% increase in the child migrants from Guatemala who have crossed or tried to cross the U.S. border since 2013.
Individuals who research migration from countries in South America to the United States cite numerous push and pull factors varying from country to country. The surge in unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle is a result of violence, war, and poverty. Examples of this war and violence include the Guatemalan Genocide which resulted in 200,000 Maya individuals being killed or disappearing at the hands of the Guatemalan military after they were believed to support and hide guerrillas. In addition, many of the children flee gang recruitment which forces them to participate in wars against other gangs and police enforcement. The recruitment age for gangs is as low as 7 to 8 years old. Many children brought into gangs are torn away from their families or forced to partake in violent actions. There is also an increase in the migration of children from the Northern Triangle that correlates with the spike in homicide rates. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime reported that for every 100,000 people in Honduras, the homicide rate was 90.4. The homicide rate for El Salvador was 41.2 and Guatemala's was 39.9. Many children cite that this violence, in all of its forms is their primary reason for fleeing their home country.
Immigration laws.
Children entering the United States illegally under the age of 18 are considered to be minors and are subject to the policies instituted for children entering the United States alone, without permission. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave two options for the detention of the unaccompanied children. The first is directed by the Department of Homeland Security and their responsibilities lie in transferring the children back to their home country. The other option functions under the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and they place the children in the foster care system. In 2006, 85% of the unaccompanied children found and placed into the hands of either the Department of Homeland Security or the Office of Refugee Resettlement were from countries in the Northern Triangle, including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The process of the removal of unaccompanied minors in the United States is outlined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). Under the INA, children with a criminal record or dangerous to society (deemed by the Department of Homeland Security) are often subject of expedited removal. The children oftentimes face the process of the juvenile criminal justice system, rather than the civil procedure their crossing calls for. This includes their lack of legal representation in courts, with a frequent need for a translator that they do not often receive. 
The Flores Settlement Agreement, enacted in 1997, attempted to bring regulations regarding the treatment of unaccompanied children in custody under the INA. Beforehand, they were often subject to maltreatment from authorities that detained them without any type of protection. The Flores Settlement Agreement required officials to allow the Department of Homeland Security to handle the detention of the minors and place them in the system of the ORR. This might include family members or sponsors, or other provisions that have a standard of care.
There are four main types of U.S. immigration relief that unaccompanied children can receive. These four are asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, U visas and T visas. Asylum is an international protection granted to unaccompanied children who face and fear persecution of "race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership a particular social group." A migrant child with Special Immigrant Juvenile Status is a minor who experienced abandonment, neglect, or abuse from a parent or both parents. Unaccompanied children who qualify for a U visa are victims of particular crimes and whose experiences have left a negative physical or mental mark. The child migrants granted a T visa are victims of trafficking of critical forms who can prove that if returned to their country, they would suffer tremendously.
Relocation of the children.
According to 2014 data, the most popular U.S regions that obtained unaccompanied children were Texas (7.4%), New York (5.8%), California (5.5%), and Florida (2.8%). All four of these regions contain shelter programs - Texas with 11, California with 5 and Florida with 2. Both Texas and Florida have a long-term foster care site and Texas has a transitional foster care program. In addition Florida also has a residential treatment center.
In regards to the custody option that some unaccompanied children are given, there are complications surrounding who the children are given to. Many are incorrectly assumed adult status. Many of the child migrants identify themselves with the age of 19, in the hopes of not being placed in their home country's child services if they are sent back. While the older age might protect them from that transfer, in the United States it calls for a different process. Most of the unaccompanied children entering the United States do not have an ID to confirm their age. If correctly determined to be a minor, some children are given to family members in the United States or to sponsors. Other children are placed in foster care systems.
Education of the children.
In Plyer v. Doe, the U.S Supreme Court challenged Section 21.031 of the Texas Education Code which granted public schools in Texas the right to charge undocumented children tuition and even deny their admittance. It held that any child regardless of immigration status living within the United States' borders can enroll and attend K-12 public schools free of cost. This is limited to elementary, middle, and high school, and does not extend to higher education such as college. Plyer v. Doe is also only applicable to undocumented minors with either a guardian or a sponsor and excludes unaccompanied minors held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement.
The Reno v. Flores landmark case was an attempt to better the conditions within ORR detainment centers. Between 2009 and 2010 the average stay of an unaccompanied minor was 61 days. That is 61 days without attending a public school and socializing with other individuals. In 2014, the Office of Refugee Resettlement declared that they are required to provide unaccompanied minors educational services in a classroom setting from Monday to Friday. In these classrooms within the detainment facility, children are taught the essentials of science, math, writing, physical education, and social studies by a licensed teacher fluent in both English and Spanish. Although they are encouraged to work with local schools to develop a curriculum and enhance the educational experience of unaccompanied minors, the ORR rarely does so.
In the 2014 to 2015 school year, 50,000 unaccompanied minors were estimated to be attending public schools. Certain individuals do so while also having a full-time job. Schools in Oakland, California have also requested additional funding in order to provide unaccompanied minors with mental health and legal resources.
Children in the workforce.
Being both undocumented and underage, unaccompanied minors who enter the workforce find employment in the secondary sector; that is, blue-collar jobs. Jobs in this segment are characterized for being labor-intensive, having low-wages, unpleasant working conditions, inconsistent schedules, few benefits, limited upward mobility, and being tenuous in that one can be fired at any time without affecting the employer. This includes jobs in the garment industry, hotel, restaurant, agricultural, child caring, vendor, and landscaping industry.
Unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle who enter this segment of the labor market are likely to face exploitation, yet they tolerate such conditions because many have families back in their sending countries that depend on their remittances. In 2012 the number of remittances immigrants sent to their respective sending countries amounted to $3.9 billion.
In Los Angeles, unaccompanied minors from the Northern Triangle find employment in L.A's garment industry. This industry is characterized by its poor working conditions which include wages being withheld, lack of ventilation, and long work schedules that prohibit minors from attending school during the day. Stephanie Canizales, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Southern California, works with Guatemalan youth and reported that among the participants in her study the median weekly income was $350 for working 11 hours a day, 6 days a week.
Mental health of children.
Unaccompanied minors migrating to the United States from the Northern Triangle are considered hidden populations, a term applied to certain populations within society for which there is few observable data. In the case of unaccompanied minors, there is scarce scientific data because their illegal status can discourage their sponsors from participating in studies, and policies forbid researchers from interviewing unaccompanied children placed in shelters.
In "Pediatric Community Mental Health", doctors Cullins, Gabriel, Solages, Call, McKnight, Concepcion, and Cho make the point that the mental health of unaccompanied minors can be categorized into three distinct phases. The first is that of their mental health pre-departure, which can be poorly affected by the fact that many unaccompanied minors either lack a parental figure (as they may be working in the United States in order to provide) or witnessed the death of one. The second stage occurs during their journey in which traveling alone poses dangerous implications such as kidnapping, extortion, violence at the hands of gangs, and having to fend for themselves. In particular, unaccompanied girls often report experiencing rape and sexual assault traveling through Mexico. The third stage takes place after their arrival when unaccompanied minors must acculturate to the United States without the guidance of an adult such as a parent or legal representative. This can be detrimental to their mental health and also may involve struggling with the fear of being deported and the challenges of not knowing English.
Many unaccompanied migrant children endure traumatic events and violence in their home countries. The effects of those experiences take a toll on their mental health, shown in the higher rates of mental illnesses among refugee children. The anxiety and grief accumulated through those experiences, added with language barriers and difficulty in adapting to the new culture or environment, can make a child vulnerable and contribute to a poor mental state, causing a higher susceptibility to illnesses like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Drawn from a sample in a research study, the rates of PTSD among unaccompanied migrant minors from the Northern Triangle is 11.8%. Anxiety affected 54.4% of the children and 38.8% of the children showed symptoms of depression.
Although the Office of Refugee Resettlement is required to perform mental health screenings, according to the previously mentioned doctors, the process in which they do so has been questioned. Previous research performed on unaccompanied children abroad shows that children cope with anxiety, post traumatic stress disorders, trouble sleeping and eating, and on rare occasions self-harming behavior.

The Bombmaker

The Bombmaker is a two-part British television drama serial, written and created by Stephen Leather, and directed by Graham Theakston. It first broadcast on Sky One on 8 April 2001, with the second and final episode following a week later on 15 April. The series, based upon Leather's novel of the same name, stars Dervla Kirwan as Andrea Hayes, a former IRA bombmaker who is forced to come out of retirement when her daughter is kidnapped and held to ransom.
Mark Womack stars as Andrea's husband Martin, while Ciara Lyons plays the role of her daughter, Katie. David Hunt, Angeline Ball, Marc Warren, Francis Magee, Daragh O'Malley, Brendan Coyle and Samantha Bond are also credited as principal members of the cast. Filming on the series commenced in September 2000. Notably, the series has yet to be released on DVD.
Production.
Dervla Kirwan said of her role as Andrea Hayes; "Graham Theakston, with whom I worked on "The Dark Room" (a BBC1 adaptation of the Minette Walters novel), was directing "The Bombmaker" and asked me if I was interested. I could see all the pitfalls in the script, but female characters who dominate like Andrea are few and far between. Whatever flaws there are, you owe it to yourself to do it. I've made a lot of mistakes in my career but the biggest mistake I've made is to turn down work. And I read Stephen Leather's book on which it was based, knew it was a bestseller and I think my commercial head took over."
Stephen Leather said of writing the series; "There are several major twists the audience won't see coming...it's not a run-of-the-mill kidnapping, but you don't find out until the end why the kidnappers have taken the little girl. You think it's an IRA story, but... it constantly keeps you guessing."

1892 United States presidential election in Arkansas

The 1892 United States presidential election in Arkansas took place on November 8, 1892. All contemporary 44 states were part of the 1892 United States presidential election. Arkansas voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, which selected the president and vice president.
Arkansas was won by the Democratic nominees, former President Grover Cleveland of New York and his running mate Adlai Stevenson I of Illinois. This election illustrated the political movement towards the one-party Jim Crow South – which would cover every county in Arkansas except Unionist Ozark Newton and Searcy. Wealthy white landowners were extremely angry that via the Union Labor Party – which the state Republicans had endorsed in the 1888 and 1890 gubernatorial elections – poor blacks and poor whites might be uniting against them. The Democratic Party thus introduced a poll tax that would weigh extremely heavily upon poor Union Labor supporters and also introduced the secret ballot which would make it more difficult for illiterate blacks and poor whites to cast a vote even if they could pay the poll tax.
Populist Weaver thought he had “magnificent” chances in the impoverished South, and campaigned heavily there. but as it turned out the halving of the electorate meant he could gain very little support. Weaver was not helped by his controversial decision to take a woman – Mary Lease – on his campaigns, as the South thought any political involvement degraded womanhood. Weaver did nonetheless win counties in Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Texas.

BDO Centre for the Community

The BDO Centre for the Community, more commonly known as the Portage Centennial Arena, is an indoor recreational facility and community centre in the city of Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, Canada. The Centennial Arena was the city's main ice hockey facility from 1967 to 2010 and was a venue for the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. The arena has been the community's secondary indoor recreation facility since the opening of Stride Place in 2010 and since been renamed the BDO Centre.
History.
1967-2010.
The Portage Centennial Arena was constructed in 1967 and was one of several projects across the country partially funded by the federal government as part of Canada's Centennial celebration. The same year, the Portage Terriers junior "A" hockey team was revived and became one of the arena's major tenants, along with the city's minor hockey teams. The city explored the idea of building a new sports complex to replace the Centennial Arena in the 1970s, however, this project was rejected by local residents. The city then expanded the Centennial Arena in 1980, adding a second indoor rink on the west side of the building.
The east rink, with a maximum capacity of 1,350 and affectionately known by local hockey fans as the "Dog Pound", hosted seven Turnbull Cup (Manitoba Junior Hockey League championship) and five ANAVET Cup series in which the Terriers appeared between 1973 and 2009. The city was one of the several Manitoba communities that co-hosted the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships with Winnipeg. Russia and the United States both played matches at the Centennial Arena.
Current Use.
The future of the Centennial Arena was uncertain after the city and joined together with the Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie to build a new state-of-the-art recreational facility, the Portage Credit Union Centre (now Stride Place), which opened in 2010. A group of local residents petitioned Portage la Prairie city council not to decommission the old arena, citing the need for a third indoor rink to accommodate the community's minor hockey and other recreational programs. The city, not willing to provide further funding to the aging arena, agreed to transfer control of the Centennial Arena to the Centennial Community Club Inc. (CCCI), a non-profit organization operated by local volunteers.
Since 2010, CCCI has operated the facility entirely through private fundraising efforts. The naming rights to the Portage Centennial Arena were sold to BDO Canada in 2011, after which it was renamed the BDO Centre for the Community. The older and larger east arena has been converted into a storage shed, while the west arena continues to be used for ice sports.

Glish started teaching at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Department of Chemistry in 2000. He currently leads the Glish Group in research focusing on mass spectrometry analytical methods.
Research.
Research by the Glish Group focuses on development and applications of mass spectrometry analytical instrumentation. One of the most prominent technologies used by Glish is differential ion mobility spectrometry, or DIMS. This separation method relies on the differing mobilities of ions in electric fields of varying strengths. DIMS/MS is used by the Glish Group to analyze lipids, leukemia antigen peptides, and aerosol compounds found in e-cigarettes.

Yumu people

The Yumu (also written Jumu) were an Indigenous Australian people of the Northern Territory.
Language.
The Yumu language was called Ŋatatara. This was often mistaken for their ethnonym and transcribed "Ngatatara" leading to confusion between the Yumu and the Ngaatjatjarra of Western Australia.
Country.
According to Norman Tindale, the Yumu ranged over some of tribal land, in the Western MacDonnell Ranges, running east of Mount Russell to the vicinity of Mount Zeil. Their northern reaches were apparently just south of central Mount Wedge and Lake Bennett. He puts their southern limits around Mount Solitary and Mount Udor. They were also present at Haast Bluff ("Ulambaura"), which they called "Paura", Mount Liebig and Peculiar.
Social organization.
The marriage rules of the Yumu were, as with the Ngalia, found to be identical to that of the Arrernte class system with the difference that prefixes were attached to the respective sexes, "t(j)a-" for males, and "na-" for females.
Myths.
According to Géza Róheim, like the Pintupi, the Yumu believed that menstruation was induced by a hirsute demon ("mamu") called 'hair-big' ("Inyutalu") is the cause of menstruation, which occurs when he penetrates the vagina, scratching it with his nails.
History of contact.
According to Tindale, the majority of the Yumu people died as a consequence of an epidemic which swept their community between 1932 and 1940. A remnant of children were adopted into the Kukatja tribe thereafter. Their land was then claimed by the Ngalia as being "mara windjul"(unpossessed country). Both Margaret Heffernan and Sarah Holcombe, writing decades later, could find no evidence for their existence, while some early observers such as H. K. Fry considered them to be a branch of the Kukatja (Luritja).

AgentCubes

AgentCubes is an educational programming language for children to create 3D and 2D online games and simulations. The main application of AgentCubes is as computational thinking tool teaching children computational thinking through game and simulation design based on the Scalable Game Design curriculum.
Similar to a spreadsheet, an agentcube is a grid-based organization. An agentcube is a four dimensional organization consisting of rows, columns, layers cubes containing stacks of programmable agents. This grid-based organization is useful to create a wide array of applications ranging from 1980-style arcade games such as Pac-Man, over 3D games to simple agent-based model. Agents can be given user created 3D shapes, they can compute formulae, move in the grid, change appearance, play sounds, animate themselves, and send messages to each other.
AgentCubes was developed with support by the National Science Foundation. Research explored if K-12 students could pick up computation thinking patterns designing games and, if later, these students could leverage these computational thinking patterns to transfer skills to make STEM simulations.
History.
AgentCubes is inspired by AgentSheets which introduced modern drag and drop blocks programming in 1995. Most notably, AgentCubes transitioned from 2D to 3D design including highly accessible 3D modelling technology called Inflatable Icons. Historically, both AgentSheets and AgentCubes are rooted in an early prototype of parallel programming for children running on a Connection Machine 2, a massively parallel supercomputer. The notion of massively parallel computing carried over to AgentCubes but leaving out the need for supercomputing hardware.
AgentCubes Online has been used in large National Science Foundation teacher professional development scale up projects nationally in the US and through the support of private foundation in countries such as Mexico, and Switzerland. In 2017 1 million projects were created. AgentCubes online is now available in English, Spanish, German, Italian and French.
Computational Thinking Tool.
With the goal to shape "computational thinkers" and not necessarily "programmers" AgentCubes, and AgentSheets before it, have the goal to be computational thinking tools and not programming tools. Computational thinking tools make Computer Science education practical in K-12 by combining Programming Support Tools with Creativity Support Tools:
Programming in AgentCubes is based on an IF/THEN parallel conditional rule formalism. Lists of conditions and actions can be assembled into rules. Rules, can be wrapped up as methods with names which can be invoked by other rules. In the spirit of computational thinking tools it is typically possible to implement games and simulations with a small number of rules. For instance, a complete Pac-Man-like game including sophisticated AI allowing the ghost to collaboratively track down pac-man can be written in just 10 rule. Similar rule-based tools are ToonTalk, or Microsoft's Kodu.

Varthamana

Varthamana (2018) is a Kannada Language film written and directed by Umesh Amshi, and produced by Ultimate Movies by Manu Bellimane and Hemavathi T.siga. 
"Varthamana" stars Sanchari Vijay and Sanjana Prakash . The cinematography was done by Govind and Venkatachala and music was composed by Sarvanaa. It revolves around the Emotional and Psychical aspects of a protagonist named Ananth. He starts living in an illusionary world realising its all happening in reality.
Plot.
Ananth a man of ideals commits a crime and looks for a man called Adarsh (Ideal). Ananth's guilty consciousness and his psychological state blur the line between reality and illusion. Sometimes he is unaware of what's happening in his life. 
As a parallel, Siddarth, a killer by profession wants to quit his job and be a free man. To be a free man he has to kill one more man. Who is that man whom he has to kill? Does he kill him? These questions pose symbolic questions such the confusions about identity of modern man. 
Thus, the movie narrates the story through colors and imagery. The movie deals with present-day man's confusion about what to do (in life) &amp; how to do in a symbolic way.
Production.
In December 2015, Sanchari Vijay signed on to appear in Varthamana . The film was revealed to have different shades of characterization with a non-linear story telling pattern and claimed to be the first avant-garde Kannada feature film. The films principal shooting began during November 2015 As the movie revolves around past and present, it has been made in a staggered fashion, over a period of 2 years.
Critical reception.
IndiaGlitz called it "A very different Experiment genre". "Times of India" stated that "The film is definitely different from what the industry has seen so far in recent times,The non-liner screenplay is much like a stream of consciousness novel". While Leading Kannada Daily "Vijayakarnataka" called the film a cult cinema with new techniques of film making and the first of its in the Indian Cinema.
Release.
The Film released across Karnataka with positive reviews on the 6th of April, 2018.

Vema Seamount

Vema Seamount is a seamount in the South Atlantic Ocean. Discovered in 1959 by a ship with the same name, it lies from Tristan da Cunha and northwest of Cape Town. The seamount has a flat top at a mean depth of which was eroded into the seamount at a time when sea levels were lower; the shallowest point lies at depth. The seamount was formed between 15-11 million years ago, possibly by a hotspot. 
The seamount rises high enough that its summit is at shallow depth, allowing sunlight to reach it and thus permitting the growth of kelp and algae. A number of sea animals and fish are encountered on the seamount; active fisheries existed at Vema Seamount and caused the disappearance of some animal species.
History.
Vema Seamount was discovered by the research ship RV Vema of the Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory in 1959. Vema is one of the first seamounts to be the subject of scientific study, and the first seamount investigated by scuba divers without special equipment. Vema lies in international waters and its summit is so shallow that it is a navigation hazard to ships.
Geomorphology and geography.
Vema Seamount lies in the South Atlantic Ocean, away from Tristan da Cunha. The cities of Cape Town and Lüderitz lie east-southeast and northeast of Vema, respectively, with Cape Town about distant.
The seamount has a conical shape with a flat top; the shallowest point rises to an elevation of below sea level - later determined to be deep - and is called Collins Point. At least one source gives a minimum depth of for the seamount, while recent bathymetric surveys have found a minimum depth of . The flat top is a summit plateau has a width of and as more recently determined at a mean depth of and has been named Emerson Plateau; it has a vaguely triangular shape pointing west, and Collins Point lies close to the western margin of the Emerson Plateau. Other points on the Plateau also rise to depths of less than . The summit plateau mostly consists of hard rock, like the upper slopes, with rocky outcrops separated by sandy plains. The plateau appears to be a wave-cut platform of Pleistocene age, when sea levels were lower, and is swept by strong ocean currents.
The seamount rises from a depth of , where it occupies a breadth of and forms an isolated conical feature. The seafloor from which Vema rises belongs to the abyssal plain of the Cape Basin. From there, the slopes of Vema first rise steeply and feature subsidiary summits; above depth the slopes flatten.
Geology.
Volcanic rocks such as tuff as well as calcareous aggregates are found on the plateau. Collins Point is composed of phonolite, which contains aegirine, alkali feldspar, augite and nepheline. Olivine basalt has also been found. A minimum age of 11.0 ± 0.3 has been obtained from samples taken at Collins Point by potassium-argon dating, with another age being 15 million years. Older ages have been obtained deeper on the seamount; a sample from depth gave an age of 18 million years. Light-coloured rocks on the summit platform may constitute a former carbonate platform.
Vema is an intraplate volcano and is considered to be the present-day location of a hotspot, the Vema hotspot, although the hotspot itself may have moved farther west (by about ) since when it created the Vema Seamount. Seismic tomography has shown what may be a mantle plume underneath Vema, another theory considers the Vema hotspot is a consequence of the Tristan hotspot shedding a secondary diapir. The hotspot origin of the Vema Seamount is not universally agreed upon. Earlier volcanism caused by the Vema hotspot may have manifested itself in southern Namibia in the form of alkaline volcanics, such as the Klinghardt phonolite, the 49 million years old Dicker Willem volcanic complex and associated Tsirub nephelinites or melilites close to the mouth of the Orange River, which are 37 million years old, or even the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province. 
Water temperatures at Vema range between , decreasing downwards, and the cold Benguela Current does not reach the seamount. The movement and strength of ocean eddies are altered when they interact with Vema Seamount, with Agulhas eddies often splitting apart at the seamount. During the ice ages, sea level drop may have exposed part of the summit platform.
Biology.
The summit of Vema Seamount is shallow enough that sunlight can reach it, resulting in the growth of various types of algae and seaweeds such as "Ecklonia" kelp. Such kelp covers large parts of the seamount and a coral framework makes up much of the summit platform.
A number of animals inhabit Vema, usually cryptic or encrusting animals. Ascidians, black corals, non-reef building corals including gorgonia and scleractinia, decapods, holothurians, hydroids, polyzoa, rock lobsters ("Jasus tristani"), sea fans and sponges live on the seamount. Other animals such as bryozoans, echinoderms, gastropods, oysters, pelecypods, serpulids and other worms have also left their traces on Vema. Rock lobsters propagate from Gough Island and Tristan da Cunha to Vema Seamount, while other species appear to originate from South Africa.
Several species appear to be endemic to Vema Seamount, including the sea snail species "Austromitra rosenbergi" discovered in 2015 and the sponge "Strongylodesma areolata" described in 1969; it is estimated that about 22-36% of all species at Vema are endemic, similar to the proportion of endemic species at other seamounts of the world. The holothurian "Holothuria vemae" is named after the seamount, where it was discovered in 1965-1966 as is the sea snail "Trivia vemacola". Vema Seamount is the type locality for the deepwater sponge "Desmacidon clavata".
A number of fish have been encountered at Vema, although most fish species appear to be pelagic species that are not directly bound to the seamount environment. Fishing operations have attracted seabirds to Vema Seamount. Euphausiids and copepods are also found in the waters, including at least one copepod that parasitizes fish. Among the fish species encountered at Vema Seamount are:
Fish on the seamount are commercially fished, with the late 1970s and 1980s seeing the initiation of "Mackerel scad" and tuna fishing, respectively. Rock lobsters in particular were heavily used; they disappeared from Vema Seamount after overfishing in the 1960s, briefly recovered and then disappeared again by 1981 due to renewed overfishing. The collapse of this fishery is one of the first instances of a seamount fishery collapsing, and has been cited as an example of how fisheries outside of exclusive economic zones end up ungoverned and abused. Today Vema Seamount is closed to fishery by the South East Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, and man-made debris such as crab traps and ropes can be found on Vema Seamount.

FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media v Staat der Nederlanden

FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media v Staat der Nederlanden (2014) C-413/13 is a European labour law case, concerning European competition law.
Facts.
A Dutch trade union for orchestra substitute workers, the Arts, Information and Media Union (FNV Kunsten Informatie en Media, "FNV"), claimed that it was not subject to competition law as the Nederlandse Mededingingsautoriteit (Netherlands Competition Authority) had claimed was possible in a "reflection document". The orchestra workers were covered by a collective agreement that FNV had entered into.
Judgment.
The Court of Justice, First Chamber, held that agreements entered into by self-employed workers could be subject to article 101(1) as self-employed people could in principle be classified as undertakings, but not in any case where workers were "false self-employed" either in contract terms or for tax purposes.

Platanthera stenochila

Platanthera stenochila is a species of flowering plant in the family Orchidaceae, native from east Nepal through the eastern Himalayas of India to south-central China (north-west Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described in 1896, as "Herminium angustilabre". It was later placed in either the genus "Monorchis" or the genus "Androcorys", both now included in "Herminium". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that it was deeply embedded in a clade of "Platanthera" species, and so transferred it to that genus as "Platanthera angustilabris" . However, this name had already been used for a different species, "Platanthera angustilabris" , so was an illegitimate name. In 2015, an acceptable replacement name, "Platanthera stenochila", was published.

Big Joanie

Big Joanie is a British punk trio formed in London in 2013. Its members are Stephanie Phillips (guitar and vocals), Estella Adeyeri (bass guitar and vocals), and Chardine Taylor-Stone (drums and vocals). After a few singles and EPs they released their first album in 2018 with Thurston Moore and Eva Prinz's Ecstatic Peace Library, and have since signed to Kill Rock Stars in the U.S.
History.
Formation and early releases.
Big Joanie was formed by Stephanie Phillips in 2013, who posted online asking for bandmates with whom to start a black feminist punk band after becoming frustrated with the lack of intersectionality in the scene. Chardine Taylor-Stone, and the band's original bassist Kiera Coward-Deyell responded. They played their first set at the inaugural First Timers, an event where all the bands had to be new, most of the members had to be playing a new instrument and they had to include someone from a marginalised group.
The name of the band is partly a tribute to Phillips’ mother, Joan, and partly based on a Caribbean figure of speech. ‘When we say a child is “acting big”, they’re acting bigger than themselves. I just thought that would be a great phrase for a strong, confident woman.’
In 2014 the band released their first EP "Sistah Punk" on Tuff Enuff Records, and in 2016 they self released a 7" three song single entitled "Crooked Room" on their own Sistah Punk Records. The title track is inspired by a lecture by the writer Melissa Harris-Perry, who compared life as a black woman in a white patriarchy to trying to find a true vertical in a room where everything is crooked. Another song on the release is a punk cover of No Scrubs by TLC.
Line-up change and Decolonise Fest.
Estella Adeyeri (also of Witching Waves and Charmpit) joined in 2017 to replace Coward-Deyell after she moved to Scotland. Later that year the band supported American bands Sad13 and Downtown Boys on UK tours. In early 2018 they recorded their debut album with producer Margo Broom at Hermitage Works Studios.
Over the weekend of 2–4 June 2017, DIY Diaspora Punx (a collective started by Phillips and also containing other London musicians such as Rachel Aggs) put on the first Decolonise Fest at DIY Space For London. Decolonise Fest is the UK's first music festival created by and for people of colour. The second edition of the festival, again mostly held at DIY Space, occurred from 22 to 24 June 2018. The festival was held for a third time over 29 to 30 June 2019, at which Big Joanie performed.
Release of debut album.
On 5 September 2018 Big Joanie announced their debut album "Sistahs" would be released in late November the same year with a music video for lead single "Fall Asleep". It is the first album to be released by Ecstatic Peace Library, a publishing company ran by visual book editor Eva Prinz and musician Thurston Moore, in their Daydream Library Series. The duo had seen the band when they supported The Ex and decided to take it upon themselves to release the band's first album as they had as of yet to find a label for it.
"Sistahs" was released on 30 November to positive reviews, including in The Guardian, Rolling Stone, and The Quietus.
In November 2018 they supported American band Parquet Courts on a UK and European tour. They played their first American shows in March 2019 at South by Southwest, debuting via BBC Music Introducing, and were announced in April as Bikini Kill's main support for their two European shows of the year at Brixton Academy in June.
On 26 February 2020, Big Joanie supported Sleater-Kinney alongside Harkin at the Brixton Academy. Phillips cites Sleater-Kinney as having "really influenced the way I thought about writing emotional songs, and my approach to punk music".
On 14 August of that year the band released a 7" single of their cover of Solange's "Cranes in the Sky" with a live recording of "It's You" from their first album on the flip. On 2 October it was announced that Big Joanie had signed in the U.S. to Portland OR based independent record label Kill Rock Stars ahead of their second album. Their first release for the label was a split with Adeyeri's other band Charmpit, which was released on 27 November of that year.
Musical style.
On OkayAfrica, the trio were noted as one of "20 Black Punk Bands You Need To Listen To". They were also called an Afro-punk and riot grrrl band.

Chronicles of Elyria

Chronicles of Elyria is a planned massively multiplayer online role-playing game that was in development by Soulbound Studios for Microsoft Windows. The game is described by the developers as utilising a dynamic quest system, and featuring closed economy, finite resource management, need-based NPC's and player-run diplomacy.
Production started in 2016 with initial financing achieved through a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter that raised $1.3m. Subsequent fundraising raised over $7.7m on their website.
The game was originally marked for an estimated December 2017 release, but this target was not met. In 2020 the game development was placed on an indefinite hiatus, and the studio laid off all of its staff. Several months later CEO Jeromy Walsh announced the project had resumed.
Development.
"Chronicles of Elyria" had a Kickstarter campaign from May 3 to June 3, 2016 raising $1.36 million, surpassing their goal of $900.000. 
Subsequent to the Kickstarter fundraising multiple webstore special events were conducted, such as the "Settlers Of Elyria," and "Searing Plague" events.
 By October 2019 the company had raised over $7.7m.
Initial development saw various iterations and milestones declared as completed against a backdrop of needing to refactor the mechanics of alpha versions of the game (e.g VoxElyria, Prelyria). A major setback in development was the dropping of SpatialOS as their backend networking/game hosting software.
Layoffs and hiatus.
After being delayed from its tentative December 2019 date, a special virtual land auction event called "Settlers of Elyria" was launched on March 12, 2020. On March 20, Soulbound Studios released a pre-alpha, gray box demo showcasing parkour mechanics. Four days later, Soulbound Studios announced the closure of the studio, complete staff layoffs and the indefinite hiatus of the project. In response to the perceived lack of delivery of a tangible product after years of development and millions of dollars in funding, as well as the close succession of the land auction, demo and abrupt studio closure, hundreds of backers of "Chronicles of Elyria" began to organize and explore legal avenues to take against Soulbound Studios and Jeromy Walsh. Within days, the office of the attorney general of Washington had received hundreds of filed complaints - among the highest in the state's history. The community around the lawsuit has also shown recent interest in including Xsolla in their lawsuit. This is because XSolla was violating the terms of service to which the backers who purchased through them agreed, by not giving refunds as the merchant.
On April 9, Walsh released a new statement, claiming that his announcement was misinterpreted and that he would be pursuing continuing the project by having former staff members continue their work on a "pro bono" basis, while he would seek new sources of funding. On June 26, Jeromy Walsh released a post on the official site announcing that the transaction logs of users was now available (they were subsequently disabled when then the site was locked). He also stated that a new series of content will be posted on the site (and other media) "in the coming weeks". However, after this post, there was no announcement or news from Soulbound Studios for over six months, which was met with sharp criticism.
Continued development.
On December 17 of 2020, Soulbound Studios released a video titled "Inside Chronicles of Elyria - Episode 1" that featured Jeromy Walsh explaining the current state and future of the company and the game. The video claimed that an independent auditor verified that the revenue backers gave to the company was "properly spent on game development". It also claimed that much of the content developed during the four years of development was not at a point for public consumption, but that many back end features had progressed. More importantly, he announced that the game is continuing active development.
Class action lawsuit.
The lawsuit was filed in the Central District Court of California, seeking damages for alleged breach of contract, violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act, and unfair competition after an announcement came out that Soulbound Studios was closing, that all the staff had been fired, and that development on the game had been ceased due to lack of funds.

Polish Criminal Police

The Polish Criminal Police () was a non-uniformed, armed and secret formation of auxiliary police, colloquially called “Polish Kripo”, active in the years 1940-1945 in the General Government during the German occupation of Poland. 
In 1940, the investigative branch was excluded from the Blue Police and converted into the Polish Criminal Police (Polnische Kriminalpolizei) connected and directly supervised by the German criminal police Kripo. The commander of German Sipo and SD in the General Government, Eberhard Schöngarth, issued a decree ordering all pre-war Polish criminal police officers to report for duty or face severe punishment. The Polish criminal police team was trained at the Security Police School (Sicherheitspolizei) and the Security Service of the Reichsführer SS (SD) in Rabka-Zdrój. It's estimated that there were between 1,790 to 2,800 ethnic Poles in the Polish Kripo units.
The organization of the Polish Criminal Police was analogous to the organization of the German “"Kriminalpolizei"" and consisted of various police stations. Station 1 dealt with robberies, assaults, murders and sabotage; station 2 - with small thefts; station 3 - with burglary and house thieves; station 4 - moral crimes; station 5 - with internal service, search of Jews in hiding and other wanted persons; station 6 - with registration of wanted persons, station 7 - with forensic technique, and photographic laboratory.

Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President

Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President is a 2018 children's book by Charlotte Pence as author and Karen Pence as illustrator. It details a fictional day in the life of Marlon Bundo, pet rabbit of Vice President of the United States Mike Pence, father of Charlotte and husband of Karen. It received lukewarm reviews from professional critics, who praised the illustrations but found fault with the prose.
Concept.
The book is an educational story explaining to children what the job of Vice President of the United States entails as seen through the eyes of the Pence family pet rabbit Marlon Bundo. The book was announced on the Instagram account dedicated to Marlon Bundo on September 15, 2017. Second Lady Karen Pence, a former teacher and a watercolor artist, painted the book's illustrations over a period of about four months. The book was released on March 19, 2018, by the children's arm of Regnery Publishing, a conservative book publisher. A book tour stopped at military bases, the Nixon and Reagan presidential libraries, and the conservative nonprofit organization Focus on the Family.
Proceeds from the book's sales were to be donated to Tracy's Kids – an art therapy program Karen Pence brought to the Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis – and The A21 Campaign, a nonprofit organization working to end human trafficking. Two of Karen Pence's original watercolors for the book illustrations were also auctioned to raise money for Tracy's Kids.
The rabbit.
Charlotte Pence acquired the rabbit that became the book's lead character when she was a film school student at Chicago's DePaul University in 2013. The rabbit was later named Marlon Bundo after the seller asked Pence to make an offer on the rabbit. This was taken as a reference to Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone saying "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse." in the 1972 film "The Godfather". Pence featured the rabbit in a short film project and then kept him as a family pet. He is said to be well-behaved and is the first rabbit to have flown on "Air Force Two", when the Pences moved to Washington, D.C. The Pences planned to take Marlon Bundo on the book's press tour.
Plot.
The story details the experiences of Marlon Bundo, the Pence family pet rabbit and BOTUS (Bunny of the United States), as he follows Grampa (vice president Mike Pence) around for a day. Included are visits to the Oval Office, the Senate, the vice president's office, and the telescope at their home at the Naval Observatory. At the end of the day, Marlon joins the vice president in reading the Bible and praying before bed.
Reception.
Commercial performance.
One week after the book's launch date, Regnery Publishing reported that "Marlon Bundo's A Day in the Life of the Vice President" was in its third printing, totaling more than 100,000 copies. "Publisher's Weekly" estimated the book had sold 26,000 copies as of May 11, 2018.
Critical reception.
On its launch date, a number of one-star reviews with negative comments were left on the book's Amazon page by non-buyers who favored the parody book, "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo". Later that day, it was no longer possible to review the Pences' book without purchasing it and one-star ratings from non-buyers had been removed.
"Kirkus Reviews" called the book's illustrations "competent", the author's verse "execrable" and the publication as a whole "[a]nodyne at best", noting the absence of 'people of color' throughout the book and giving it a "skip it" rating. Similarly, Susie Wilde of "The News &amp; Observer" praised the illustrations and criticized the writing, "Pence shows her skill at realistic watercolors and captures the cuteness factor of the real BOTUS... The book fails when it comes to the text, though." "Esquire" mentioned the strained verse as well and called the book mediocre. Katy Waldman in "The New Yorker" also criticized the book's verse as "mostly embarrassing."
Parody.
Charlotte Pence's book and Mike Pence's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage inspired "Last Week Tonight with John Oliver" writer Jill Twiss to author "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo". The story details the same-sex romance of rabbits Marlon Bundo and Wesley, who face opposition from a stink bug who is against same-sex marriage. "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo" is billed as an actual children's story about marriage equality and democracy, rather than as a straight-up parody of Charlotte Pence's book, yet it includes some "definite digs" at the vice president.
Charlotte Pence supported "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo", posting on Twitter a picture of herself and the real-life Marlon Bundo wearing a bow tie identical to the one in Jill Twiss' book, and saying on "Mornings with Maria": "His book is contributing to charities that I think we can all get behind... I'm all for it." The official Marlon Bundo Instagram account also referred to Twiss' book in a positive light, stating "Not gonna lie, I do look pretty fly in a bow tie. The only thing better than one bunny book for charity is...TWO bunny books for charity." The Twiss book's profits were also given to charities, namely The Trevor Project and AIDS United.
Conversely, Regnery Publishing initially criticized the release of "A Day in the Life of Marlon Bundo", saying that it was "unfortunate that anyone would feel the need to ridicule an educational children's book and turn it into something controversial and partisan." When the success of both books became apparent, Regnery complimented John Oliver and Chronicle Books for their sales figures, adding: "There's plenty to go around for everyone and, like Charlotte [Pence] said, we can all be happy the proceeds are going to a good cause."

The board was established on January 19, 2016 and is made up of three permanent federal members and two members from each of the provinces or territories where a vacancy is to be filled‍. On January 19, 2016, the names of the members of the Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments was announced. The chair is former deputy minister Huguette Labelle. There are two other federal members: Ms. Melissa Blake from Fort McMurray, Alberta and the Honourable Francois Rolland from Montreal.

2017 Westmeath Senior Football Championship

The 2017 Westmeath Senior Football Championship is the 113th edition of the Westmeath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Westmeath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 12 teams, with the winner going on to represent Westmeath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage.
St. Loman's Mullingar were the defending champions after they defeated Tyrrellspass in the previous years final to complete a "2-in-a-row" of titles.
This was Rosemount's return to the senior grade after a 17-year exodus when claiming the 2016 Westmeath Intermediate Football Championship title.
Team Changes.
The following teams have changed division since the 2016 championship season. 
To S.F.C..
Promoted from 2016 Westmeath Intermediate Football Championship
From S.F.C..
Relegated to 2017 Westmeath Intermediate Football Championship
Group stage.
All 12 teams enter the competition at this stage.
The competition split into two groups, based on their performance in the 2016 Group stages. Group 1 consists of teams who reached the Quarter-Finals last year or better. Group 2 consists of two bottom placed finishers in Group 1 last year as well as 3rd and 4th placed in Group 2 last year, the 2016 Relegation Playoff winners and the 2016 Intermediate champions.
The top 2 teams in Group 1 go into the Semi-Finals, where they await the winners of the Quarter-Finals, which are composed of the 3rd and 4th placed teams in Group 1 along with the top 2 finishers in Group 2. The bottom 2 teams in Group 2 will enter a Relegation Playoff.
Caulry were defeated in the Relegation Play-off, and hence were relegated to the 2018 I.F.C. after three seasons in the top flight.
Knock-out stages.
Relegation final.
The bottom finisher from both groups qualify for the Relegation final. The loser will be relegated to the 2017 Intermediate Championship.
Finals.
There are 2 groups called Group A and B. The top finisher in each group qualify for the Semi Finals directly. The second and the third-placed finishers in both groups will qualify for the Quarter Finals.

Ambient video

Ambient video is a genre of video that puts emphasis on atmosphere over traditional storytelling or news content. Its purpose is to create a soothing, pleasant environment through the use of imagery. A typical video might include footage of waves rolling over the beach accompanied by soft ambient music. Some additional examples might include movement of water, sunrise or sunset, or slow movement such as that of a jellyfish. Ambient video can be the subject of focus or alternatively run unobtrusively in the background.
Uses.
Because of its ability to transform spaces, ambient video is often used for meditation or relaxation. In addition to providing visual focus, ambient video can figuratively transport viewers to new locations and, although is often accompanied by, is not dependent on music.
Although ambient video often serves as background art, its visual nature allows it to also be used:
History of ambient video.
Ambient video is a new art form made possible by the increasing availability of large-scale, high-definition video display units. Introduced in the late 1990s, the first flat wide-screen televisions were expensive, costing as much as $15,000 in 1997. As costs rapidly declined, by 2008 larger screens became affordable and available for average consumers, increasing the demand for new content.
 In addition, the number of televisions per household increased. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, in 1997 30% of households had three or more televisions compared to 39% in 2015.

Virtual reality applications

Virtual reality applications are applications that make use of virtual reality (VR), an immersive sensory experience that digitally simulates a virtual environment. Applications have been developed in a variety of domains, such as education, architectural and urban design, digital marketing and activism, engineering and robotics, entertainment, virtual communities, fine arts, healthcare and clinical therapies, heritage and archaeology, occupational safety, social science and psychology.
Architecture and urban design.
One of the first recorded uses of virtual reality in architecture was in the late 1990s when the University of North Carolina virtually modelled Sitterman Hall, home of its computer science department. Designers wore a headset and used a hand controller to simulate moving around a virtual space. With an Autodesk Revit model they could "walk through" a schematic. VR enables architects to better understand the details of a project such as the transition of materials, sightlines, or visually displays of wall stress, wind loads, solar heat gain, or other engineering factors. By 2010, VR programs had been developed for urban regeneration, planning and transportation projects. Entire cities were simulated in VR.
Restorative nature experiences.
Studies on exposure to nature environments shows how it is able to produce relaxation, recover attention capacity and cognitive function, reduce stress and stimulate positive mood.
Immersive virtual reality technology is able to replicate believable restorative nature experiences, either using 360 degree video footage or environments created from 3D real-time rendering often developed using game engines (for example Unreal Engine or Unity) This is useful for users who are deprived from accessing certain areas, due to e.g. physical restraints or complications, such as senior citizens or nursing home residents. Restorative virtual environments are able replicate and mediate real world experiences using video footage, replicate these using 3D rendering or can be based loosely on real world environment using real-time 3D rendering.
Healthcare and Medical.
VR began to appear in rehabilitation in the 2000s. For Parkinson's disease, evidence of its benefits compared to other rehabilitation methods is lacking. A 2018 review on the effectiveness of VR mirror therapy and robotics found no benefit. Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a form of exposure therapy for treating anxiety disorders such as post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and phobias. Studies have indicated that combining VRET with behavioral therapy, patients experience a reduction of symptoms. In some cases, patients no longer met the DSM-V criteria for PTSD.
Virtual Reality is also tested in the field of behavioral activation therapy. BA therapy encourages patient to change their mood by scheduling positive activities into the day-to-day life. Due to a lack of access to trained providers, physical constraints or financial reasons, many patients are not able to attend BA therapy. Researchers are trying to overcome these challenges by providing BA via Virtual Reality. The idea of the concept is to enable especially elderly adults to participate in engaging activities that they wouldn't be able to attend without VR. Possibly, the so called "BA-inspired VR protocols" will mitigate the lower mood, life satisfaction, and likelihood of depressions.
Furthermore researchers are using VR to study how people with social anxiety learn and make decisions. Aim is to improve interventions of anxiety disorders.
Immersive VR can motivate exercise with challenged sedentary users, such as for rehabilitation centers or senior citizen homes, increasing quality of life and independence through increased physical activity (see right image). Immersive VR has also been shown useful for acute pain management, on the theory that it may distract people, reducing their experience of pain.
Some companies and researchers are adapting VR for fitness, either motivating physical therapy or exercise, e.g. by contextualizing e.g. biking through VR-based experiences (see right image), or by using gamification concepts to encourage exercise.
Virtual Reality Medical Simulation Training.
With the rise of COVID-19 in 2020, opportunities for clinical training and education were greatly reduced due to the lack of availability of clinical educators and the need to establish social distancing by avoiding in-person interaction.
Digital marketing.
Virtual reality presents an opportunity and an alternative channel for digital marketing. International Data Corporation expected spending to increase for augmented and virtual reality, forecasting a compound annual growth rate of 198% in 2015–2020. Revenues were expected to rise to $143.3 billion in 2020. Global spending on digital advertisements was forecast to increase to $335.5 billion by 2020. A 2015 study found that 75% of companies on Forbes' World's Most Valuable Brands list had developed a VR or AR experience. Although VR is not widespread among consumers compared to other forms of digital media, many companies have invested in VR. Some companies adopted VR to enhance workplace collaboration.
VR can present high definition, three-dimensional interactive imaging. Its marketing benefits were observed by Suh and Lee through via laboratory experiments: with a VR interface, participants' product knowledge and product attitude noticeably increased. VR marketing can engage consumers' emotions. Both studies indicate an increased desire to purchase products marketed through VR; however, these benefits showed minimal return on investment (ROI). Suh and Lee found that products that are primarily experienced through hearing and vision (but not others) benefit more from VR marketing.
Ads that appear during a VR experience (interruption marketing) may be considered invasive. Consumers want to decide whether to accept an ad. Organizations can for example require the user to download a mobile app before experiencing their VR campaign.
Non-profit organizations have used VR to bring potential supporters closer to distant social, political and environmental issues in immersive ways not possible with traditional media. Panoramic views of the conflict in Syria and face-to-face encounters with CGI tigers in Nepal are some examples.
Retailers use VR to show how a product will fit in consumers' homes. Consumers looking at digital photos of the products can virtually spin the product to view it from the side or back.
Architectural design firms allow clients to tour virtual models of proposed buildings. Architects can use VR to experience their developing designs. VR models can replace scale models. Developers and owners can create VR models of existing structures.
Education and training.
VR is used to help learners develop skills without the real-world consequences of failing, especially useful in realms with life-or-death implications. The specific device used to provide the VR experience, whether it be through a mobile phone or desktop computer, does not appear to impact on any educational benefit.
In recent case studies the VR training approach not only proofs better understanding, but also higher satisfaction amongst students. The number of errors can be reduced and the completion time for specific tasks can be shortened.
An increasing number of companies rely on virtual reality when it comes to onboarding of employees. VR onboarding is cheaper and more efficient compared to conventional training, as no demo equipment is required.
Mining Industry.
Many mining accidents can be attributed to inadequate or insufficient training. With Virtual Reality training, one may simulate the exposure to a real working environment, without the associated risk.
Flight and vehicular applications.
Flight simulators are a form of VR training. They can range from a fully enclosed module to computer monitors providing the pilot's point of view. Driving simulations can train tank drivers on the basics before allowing them to operate the real vehicle. Similar principles are applied in truck driving simulators for specialized vehicles such as fire trucks. As these drivers often have limited opportunity for real-world experience, VR training provides additional training time.
Medicine.
VR technology has many useful applications in the medical field. Through VR, novice surgeons have the ability to practice complex surgeries without stepping into the operating room. Physicians who experience VR simulations improved their dexterity and performance in the operating room significantly more than control groups. VR can produce a three-dimensional representation of a particular patient's anatomy that allows surgeons to map out the surgery ahead of time. Trainees may use real instruments and video equipment to practice in simulated surgeries. Through the revolution of computational analysis abilities, fully immersive VR models are currently available in neurosurgery training. Ventriculostomy catheters insertion, endoscopic and endovascular simulations are used in neurosurgical residency training centers across the world. Experts see VR training as an essential part of the curriculum of future training of neurosurgeons. 
Military.
In 1982 Thomas A. Furness III presented the United States Air Force with a working model of his virtual flight simulator, the Visually Coupled Airborne Systems Simulator (VCASS). The second phase of his project, which he called the "Super Cockpit", added high-resolution (for the time) graphics and a responsive display. The United Kingdom has been using VR in military training since the 1980s. The United States military announced the Dismounted Soldier Training System in 2012. It was cited as the first fully immersive military VR training system.
Virtual training environments have been claimed to increase realism while minimizing cost, e.g., by saving ammunition. In 2016, researchers at the U.S. Army Research Laboratory reported that instructor feedback is necessary for virtual training. Virtual training has been used for combined arms training and instructing soldiers to learn when to shoot.
Military programs such as Battle Command Knowledge Systems (BCKS) and Advanced Soldier Sensor Information and Technology (ASSIST) were intended to assist the development of virtual technology. Described goals of the ASSIST initiative were to develop software and wearable sensors for soldiers to improve battlefield awareness and data collection. Researchers stated that these programs would allow the soldier to update their virtual environment as conditions change. Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3, successor to the earlier versions named VBS1 and VBS2) is a widely used military training solution adapted from a commercial off the shelf product. Live, Virtual, Constructive – Integrated Architecture (LVC-IA) is a U.S. military technology that allows for multiple training systems to work together to create an integrated training environment. Reported primary uses of the LVC-IA were live training, virtual training, and constructive training. In 2014, the LVC-IA version 1.3 included VBS3.
Space.
NASA has used VR technology for decades. Most notable is their use of immersive VR to train astronauts before flights. VR simulations include exposure to zero-gravity work environments, training on how to spacewalk and tool usage using low-cost tool mock-ups.
Engineering and robotics.
In the mid-to-late 1990s 3D computer-aided design (CAD) data took over when video projectors, 3D tracking and computer technology enabled its use in virtual reality environments. Active shutter glasses and multi-surface projection units appeared. Virtual reality has been used in automotive, aerospace, and ground transportation original equipment manufacturers. Virtual reality aids prototyping, assembly, service and performance use-cases. This enables engineers from different disciplines to experience their design. Engineers can view the bridge, building or other structure from any angle. Simulations allow engineers to test their structure's resistance to winds, weight, and other elements.
Virtual reality can control robots in telepresence and telerobotic systems. VR has been used in experiments that investigate how robots can be applied as an intuitive human user interface. Another example is remotely-controlled robots in dangerous environments.
Entertainment.
Video games.
Early commercial virtual reality headsets were released for gaming during the early-mid 1990s. These included the Virtual Boy, iGlasses, Cybermaxx and VFX1 Headgear. Since 2010, commercial headsets for VR gaming include the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and PlayStation VR. The Samsung Gear VR is an example of a phone-based device.
Other modern examples of VR for gaming include the Wii Remote, the Kinect, and the PlayStation Move/PlayStation Eye, all of which track and send player motions to the game. Many devices complement VR with controllers or haptic feedback. VR-specific and VR versions of popular video games have been released.
Cinema.
Films produced for VR permit the audience to view scenes in 360 degrees. This can involve the use of VR cameras to produce interactive films and series. Pornography makers use VR, usually for POV-style porn.
The 2016 World Chess Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Sergey Karjakin was promoted as "the first in any sport to be broadcast in 360-degree virtual reality." However, a VR telecast featuring Oklahoma hosting Ohio State, preceded it on September 17, 2016. The telecasts (which used roughly 180 degrees of rotation, not the 360 required for full VR) were made available through paid smartphone apps and head-mounted displays.
Music.
VR can allow individuals to virtually attend concerts. VR concerts can be enhanced using feedback from the user's heartbeat and brainwaves. Virtual reality can be used for other forms of music, such as music videos and music visualization or visual music applications.
Family entertainment centers.
In 2015 roller coasters and theme parks began to incorporate VR to match visual effects with haptic feedback. The Void is a theme park in Pleasant Grove, Utah that offers VR attractions that stimulate multiple senses. In March 2018, a VR water slide was launched using a waterproof headset.
Virtual communities.
Large virtual communities have formed around social virtual worlds that can be accessed with VR technologies. Popular examples include VRChat, Rec Room, and AltspaceVR, but also social virtual worlds that were originally developed without support for VR, for example Roblox.
Fine arts.
David Em was the first fine artist to create navigable virtual worlds, in the 1970s. His early work was done on mainframes at Information International, Inc., Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and California Institute of Technology. Jeffrey Shaw with "Legible City" in 1988 and Matt Mullican with "Five into One" in 1991, were among the first to exhibit elaborate VR artworks.
"Virtopia" was the first VR artwork to premiere at a film festival. Created by artist/researcher Jacquelyn Ford Morie with researcher Mike Goslin, it debuted at the 1992 Florida Film Festival. A more developed version of the project appeared at the 1993 Florida Film Festival. Other artists to explore the early artistic potential of VR through the 1990s include Jeffrey Shaw, Ulrike Gabriel, Char Davies, Maurice Benayoun, Knowbotic Research, Rebecca Allen and Perry Hoberman.
The first Canadian virtual reality film festival was the FIVARS Festival of International Virtual &amp; Augmented Reality Stories, founded in 2015 by Keram Malicki-Sánchez. In 2016, the first Polish VR program, "The Abakanowicz Art Room" was realized – it documented the art office of Magdalena Abakanowicz, made by Jarosław Pijarowski and Paweł Komorowski. Some museums have begun making some of their content virtual reality accessible including the British Museum and the Guggenheim.
Great Paintings VR is a fully immersive virtual reality museum on Steam. It provides more than 1000 famous paintings from different museums of all over the world. 
Heritage and archaeology.
Virtual reality enables heritage sites to be recreated. The sites may be have restricted or no access for the public, such as caves, damaged/destroyed structures, or sensitive environments that are closed to allow them to recover from overuse.
The first use of VR in a heritage application was in 1994 when a museum visitor interpretation provided an interactive "walk-through" of a 3D reconstruction of Dudley Castle in England as it was in 1550. This consisted of a computer controlled laserdisc-based system designed by engineer Colin Johnson. The system was featured in a conference held by the British Museum in November 1994.
Occupational safety.
VR simulates real workplaces for occupational safety and health (OSH) purposes. Within work scenarios, for example, some parts of a machine move of their own accord while others can be moved by human operators. Perspective, angle of view, and acoustic and haptic properties change according to where the operator is standing and how he or she moves relative to the environment.
VR can be used for OSH purposes to:
Social science and psychology.
Virtual reality offers social scientists and psychologists a cost-effective tool to study and replicate interactions in a controlled environment. It allows an individual to embody an avatar. "Embodying" another being presents a different experience from simply imagining that you are someone else. Researchers have used immersion to investigate how digital stimuli can alter human perception, emotion and physiological states, and how can change social interactions, in addition to studying how digital interaction can enact social change in the physical world.
Altering perception, emotion and physiological states.
Studies have considered how the form we take in virtual reality can affect our perception and actions. One study suggested that embodying the body of a child can cause objects to be perceived as much larger otherwise. Another study found that white individuals who embodied the form of a dark-skinned avatar performed a drumming task with a more varied style than otherwise.
Research exploring perception, emotions and physiological responses within VR suggest that virtual environments can alter how a person responds to stimuli. For example, a virtual park coupled affects subjects' anxiety levels. Similarly, simulated driving through dark areas in a virtual tunnel can induce fear. Social interaction with virtual characters has been shown to produce physiological responses such as changes in heart rate and galvanic skin responses.
Research suggests that a strong presence can facilitate an emotional response, and this emotional response can further increase the feeling of presence. Similarly, breaks in the presence (or a loss in the sense of presence) can cause physiological changes.
Understanding biases and stereotypes.
Researchers have utilized embodied VR perspective-taking to evaluate whether changing a person's self-representation may help in reducing bias against particular social groups. However, the nature of any relationship between embodiment and bias is not yet defined. Individuals who embodied old people demonstrated a significant reduction in negative stereotyping when compared with individuals embodying young people. Similarly, light-skinned individuals placed in dark-bodied avatars showed a reduction in their implicit racial bias. However, other research has shown individuals taking the form of a black avatar had higher levels of implicit racial bias favoring whites after leaving the virtual environment.
Investigating basal mental abilities like Spatial Cognition.
One of the most general abilities in order to perform in everyday life is Spatial Cognition, which involves orientation, navigation etc. Especially in the field of its investigation, Virtual Reality became an invaluable tool, since it allows to test the performance of subjects in an environment which is highly-immersive and controllable at the same time.
Furthermore, the newest head-mounted displays allow also the implementation of eye-tracking, which provides precious insight in cognitive processes, for example in terms of attention.
Obstacles.
, motion sickness is still a major issue for virtual reality. The delay between a motion and the updating of the screen image is the source. Users often report discomfort. One study reported that all 12 participants complained of at least two side effects while three had to withdraw from severe nausea and dizziness.
Along with motion sickness, users can also become distracted by the new technology hardware. A study showed how when VR was incorporated into a laboratory environment, the students felt more engaged with the concept, but retained less information due to the new distraction.
Virtual reality users remove themselves from the physical environment. This creates a risk that the user will experience a mishap while moving. Immersion in a virtual world has the potential for social exclusion that may decrease positive mood and increase anger. Behavior in virtual reality may have lasting psychological impact when returning to the physical world. Russian news agency, TASS, reported in 2017, a death from VR use, when a 44-year old man "tripped and crashed into a glass table, suffered wounds and died on the spot from a loss of blood". It is thought to be the first death from VR use.

Tortona–Genoa high-speed railway

The Tortona–Genoa high-speed railway, also known as Third Pass (), will be a railway designed for high-speed, high-capacity services linking Genoa to Tortona near Milan, Italy. The railway is within the scope of the Trans-European Transport Networks project, specifically, of its Rhine–Alpine corridor.
Construction work started during 2013, at the time, the railway was expected to be completed by 2023. The line will be long, of which being tunnels. In addition to the line itself, a further of branches connecting the railway to various existing lines are also planned. The estimated cost for the construction of the railway is €6.2 billion.
Background.
During the 1990s, the development of a modern high speed railway line between Tortona and Genoa became viewed as an increasingly important pending development for Italy's transport infrastructure. Once completed, it is to function as a key economic corridor, facilitating the easier movement of traffic between the Ligurian coast with Italy's major industrial regions of Piedmont and Lombardy, forming a triangle between the cities of Genoa, Turin, and Milan. Further afield, the railway shall be one small element of the wider Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T) of high speed railways that are to cross the European continent for the speedy transference of both passengers and freight throughout, and thus act to boost international trade between Italy and the rest of Europe by providing a direct route between the ports of Genoa and Rotterdam via the Alps.
Once complete, the railway, which is to support a maximum speed of 250 kmph, has been projected to reduce journey times between Genoa and Milan from 1 hour and 39 minutes today to only 50 minutes. It is believed that a greater proportion of freight from central Europe could be directed to Genoa instead of ports on the North Sea as well, resulting in a decrease in shipping times to Asia of five days. Extensive civil engineering works are involved in the railway's construction, of its 53km length, 37km of which is underground. Accordingly, several major tunnels are to be built, such as the Colombo, San Tomaso and Polcevera tunnels, which were at one stage scheduled to be built at a cost of €120m over the course of 30 months.
The Italian railway infrastructure company Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) functions as the project's client, while the state-owned engineering firm Italferr provides supervision. As a result of a competitive tendering process the COCIV consortium was appointed as the railway's general contractor; it comprises the civil engineering companies Salini-Impregilo (64%), Condotte (31%) and CIV (5%). During September 2003, the final design phase for the railway commenced.
Construction.
Construction of the line commenced in April 2012. As part of preparatory work ahead of construction, roughly 30km of roads were constructed or upgraded to accommodate heavy goods vehicles involved in the construction as well as to ease general traffic flows. The construction activity was divided into six separate lots, the first two of which were activated in advance of the remaining four lots.
During July 2015, it was announced that the excavation of the Campasso Tunnel had been completed. This 600m-long tunnel was a key engineering element of Lot 1 and facilitates a connection between the new railway and the historic Succursale dei Giovi (Genoa-Milan-Turin route) line. The railway's tunnels are typically built as a pair of single-track tunnels adjoined by cross-connections. However, during mid 2018, construction of the Tortona–Genoa high-speed railway was suspended for two years, reportedly due to a contractual dispute.
On 21 July 2020, tunneling work was resumed as a result of a new contract having been signed between Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI) and the COCIV consortium in regards to both design and construction activities for the railway. Around the same time, further contracts were also issued to the Cociv consortium to build several connections between the new high speed railway and existing lines at Voltri, Genoa Parco Campo, and Tortona.
By July 2020, the Tortona–Genoa high-speed railway was reportedly 40 percent complete. During late September 2020, breakthroughs were achieved in both the Valico tunnel (Galleria di Valico) and the Serravalle tunnel (Galleria dei Serravalle); as a consequence, every work sites was directly connected to one another along a 17km stretch. The 27km long Valico tunnel was excavated using traditional techniques, while the vast majority of the 7km Serravalle tunnel was driven via a tunnel boring machine (TBM). Webuild hailed the twin breakthroughs as being the halfway point on all of the route's excavations.

Yu Shuishan

Yu Shuishan () is one of the master contemporary "guqin" players and contributors. He is a Professor of Architecture in the College of Arts, Media and Design at the Northeastern University, a fourth generation Mei’an School guqin player, and the founder of North America Mei'an Society (北美梅庵琴社).
Biography.
Shuishan Yu graduated from Tsinghua University, and joined Northeastern University since 2012. His research focuses on Chinese architecture, modern architecture and its theoretical discourse, literati arts, and Buddhist architecture in East Asia. His current research projects include case studies of historic streets in China and the role they played in the modernization of Chinese cities, architecture and urbanism of Beijing, and literati gardens of the Ming-Qing dynasties, and a new theory and method of qin music to be published by the prestigious Zhonghua Book Company. He is a key member and contributor to the GAHTC, an organization of architectural historians aiming for the integration of global history of architecture and the development of new pedagogical strategy in teaching architectural history.
His book "Chang’an Avenue and the Modernization of Chinese Architecture" was published in English by the University of Washington Press (2012) and in Chinese by the Sanlian Shudian Press (2016). He has also published articles, book chapters, and exhibition catalogs and presented conference papers on the city and architecture of Beijing, Tibetan Buddhist architecture, Chinese literati art, and modern architectural historiography. Yu's research projects are mostly case studies aiming for the demystification of a specific historical site, issue, or phenomenon, and highlight the significance, nature, and problem of cross-cultural translation of architectural forms, practices, and theories.
Before joining Northeastern University, Yu has worked as an architect in the Ministry of Construction Architectural Design Institute in Beijing and taught in the Department of Art and Art History at the Oakland University in Michigan. He has been teaching Architecture and Global Cultures, Pre-Modern Chinese Architecture, and the Modernization of Chinese Architecture at Northeastern. He has taught Western Architectural History in Beijing, Chinese Architecture in the School of Architecture at the University of Washington, and Chinese Architecture, Buddhist Art, Chinese Art, Japanese Art, Asian Art Survey, and Applied Guqin Performance at Oakland.
Yu is also a distinguished qin musician and the current chair of the North America Mei’an Guqin Society. Learning Chinese instruments since age seven, he later studied guqin with Wu Ziying (吳自英), a third generation Mei’an School player who had learned from such renowned 20th-century masters as Wang Jiru (王吉儒), Xu Lisun (徐立孫), Wu Jinglue (吳景略), and Zha Fuxi (査阜西). Prof. Yu founded the North America Mei’an Guqin Society in 2009 and served as its chair since then. He is especially committed to the spread of guqin music among non-Chinese speaking communities. He taught applied guqin at the Oakland University in 2009–12. 
His fingering-centered etude writing aims to systematize experience-based guqin education and his composition explores new possibilities rooted in the Chinese musical traditions. Prof. Yu has been invited for performance and lecture on qin music both in the US and internationally.
Prof. Yu has also published three albums on improvisation and extemporisation on the qin, which are "The Pure Sound of Mountain and Water" 【山水清音】(2009), "The Vibrant Rhythm of Ancient Heroes" 【長虹古韻】(2012) and "The Utopia Empathy of Past and Present" 【一契落英】(2017) respectively.

Liberty Arena is a 4,000-seat arena in Lynchburg, Virginia on the campus of Liberty University. Construction began in the fall of 2018 and was completed in 2020, with a ceremonial opening held on November 23 of that year. The arena is home to the Liberty Flames and Lady Flames men's and women's basketball teams, the Lady Flames volleyball team, and other events for which attendance is not expected to exceed 4,000.
Liberty Arena is adjacent to the Flames and Lady Flames' previous home, the Vines Center, with a tunnel connecting the two venues. "The Furnace" will continue to host Flames and Lady Flames games and events where attendance is expected to exceed 4,000. The first scheduled event was the Lady Flames' 76–53 win over Norfolk State on December 1, 2020. Two days later, the men's basketball team made its debut, defeating Saint Francis (PA) 78–62. The arena had originally been scheduled to open for Lady Flames volleyball in August 2020; however, after COVID-19 caused most NCAA teams, including Liberty, to move the women's volleyball season from its normal fall schedule to spring 2021 (with the NCAA moving its championship event to the spring), the volleyball opening was moved to January 22, 2021 against VCU.

Anna Campbell

Anna Montgomery Campbell (1991 – 15 March 2018), also known as Hêlîn Qereçox, was a British feminist, anarchist and prison abolition activist who fought with the Women's Protection Units (YPJ) in the Rojava conflict of the Syrian civil war. She was killed in Rojava by a Turkish Armed Forces missile strike.
Ancestry and early life.
Campbell was born in Lewes, East Sussex, England, the daughter of progressive rock musician Dirk Campbell. Her mother was Katherine Emma "Adrienne Katie", born Bridges, her father's second wife.
Campbell had military forebears, with ancestors serving in the Royal Navy and Royal Artillery. Her grandfather served in The Royal Tank Regiment in World War II.
She was educated at the independent St Mary's Hall, Brighton, then went to study at University of Sheffield before moving to Bristol, where she worked as a plumber and at a small left-wing book and coffee shop named "Hydra". Campbell was involved with many political movements, including the 2010 United Kingdom student protests, the Hunt Saboteurs Association, Anarchist Black Cross and other anarchist and abolitionist organisations and projects, including international ones such as ZAD de Notre-Dame-des-Landes.
Involvement in the Rojava conflict.
During the Rojava conflict, Campbell fought with the YPJ in the Deir ez-Zor campaign, an attack on the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant stronghold of Deir ez-Zor. She was also involved in the YPJ's activities in support of women's rights in Kurdistan. According to "The New York Times", she was moved by the defence of "an autonomous, mostly Kurdish region in northern Syria, known as Rojava, whose leaders advocate a secular, democratic and egalitarian politics, with equal rights for women".
Death.
Campbell was killed by a Turkish Armed Forces missile strike during the Turkish military operation in the Afrin Canton, Operation Olive Branch. The YPJ announced:
She is the first British woman to die fighting for the YPJ.
Following the announcement of Campbell's death, her father started a campaign to recover her body, which could not be located by aid organisations until a ceasefire was in place in the area. Dirk Campbell accused the British government of 'a total lack of proactivity' in helping to recover her body, which is yet to be recovered from the battlefield as of 2019.
In response to Campbell's death there were various protests around the world, protesters from the Bristol Kurdish Solidarity Network (BKSN) and friends of Campbell blocked the offices of BAE Systems in Bristol, the city Anna lived in previously. Activists accuse the company of supplying weapons to Turkey which have been used against civilians in Rojava. Another protest in Bristol was held a year after Anna's death. It was reported to have blocked a large roundabout and caused traffic problems in the local area. Graffiti has also sprung up in the city showing solidarity, particularly in the Easton, Bristol and Saint Pauls where many of the anarchist projects she was part of are based.
As well as the local protests support has been shown from many other individuals and projects across the world.

The 2018 Westmeath Senior Football Championship is the 114th edition of the Westmeath GAA's premier club Gaelic football tournament for senior graded teams in County Westmeath, Ireland. The tournament consists of 12 teams, with the winner going on to represent Westmeath in the Leinster Senior Club Football Championship. The championship starts with a seeded group stage and then progresses to a knock out stage.
St. Loman's Mullingar were the defending champions for the third season running after defeating Tyrrellspass in the previous years final to complete a "3-in-a-row" of titles. However their reign as champions ended in this year's final. 
This was St. Mary's Rochfortbridge's return to the senior grade after an 11 year exodus since relegation in 2006 when claiming the 2017 Westmeath Intermediate Football Championship title.
On 21 October 2018, Mullingar Shamrocks claimed their 12th S.F.C. title and dethroned their town rivals St. Loman's when defeating them by 2-12 to 1-11 in the final at Cusack Park. This was their first triumph since 2012.
Maryland were relegated to the I.F.C. for 2019 when finishing pointless at the bottom of Group B. This ended their 10 year stay in the top-flight of Westmeath club football.
Team changes.

DIGI Group

DIGI (Teraoka/DIGI Group) is a global corporation with offices in Japan, Europe and North America. Founded in 1934, it supplies weighing and packaging equipment for trade, industries, and logistics. Its products are widely used in the manufacturing, retail, and consumer fields. The company occupies 30% of the Russian market of weighing scales.
Although the company dates back to 1934, its activity dates back to 1910, when industrialist Teraoka Toyonaru created the Japan Calculation Machinery Manufacturing Co, which was focused on innovative technologies and supporting inventions. It produced precision instruments for industries and consumers. At the time of its inception, Teraoka had already developed weight scales capable of functioning under different temperature environments, which had been patented in Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany and France. Establishing itself firmly in its market, Teraoka Takeharu, son of Toyonaru, started the Teraoka Research Center (Teraoka Seiko Co., Ltd.), which would eventually form part of Teraoka/DIGI Group. The corporation presently operates five R&amp;D centres and five production sites across Europe and Asia, as well as its own line of strain gauges.

2018 U Sports University Cup

The 2018 U Sports Men's University Cup Hockey Tournament (56th Annual) was held March 15–18, 2018 in Fredericton, New Brunswick and played at the Aitken Centre on UNB's Fredericton campus. This event marked the second year of a successful two-year bid to host the 2017 and 2018 USports University Cup. This is the 3rd time UNB has hosted the University Cup - they first hosted a two-year bid in 2003 &amp; 2004 and again in 2011 &amp; 2012. UNB is the first program to host the event 3 times since the expanded format was introduced in 1998.
The Alberta Golden Bears won their 16th title over the St. Francis Xavier X-Men. Alberta last won the University Cup in 2015. St. F.X. was last in the final in 2016 when they lost to UNB Varsity Reds in the finals.
It was announced a month prior to the tournament, that the next two tournaments would be 'singles', first hosted by Lethbridge Pronghorns (2019/UCup57 - ENMAX Centre) followed by Acadia Axemen (2020/UCup58 - Scotiabank Centre). The tournament format would remain unchanged for both years.
Road to the Cup.
OUA playoffs.
Note 1: UQTR forfeit their first 13 games due to an ineligible player, resulting in the loss of eight(8) wins. Their record of 15-6-1, at the time of the January announcement, was correct to 7-14-1. They finished with a record of 8-19-1 (17pts for 10th). 
Note 2: The Queen's Cup championship game must be held in Ontario (part of the arrangement when the RSEQ hockey league merged with the OUA). When a Quebec-based OUA-East representative is the higher seed and should 'host' the game - the game shall be hosted by the OUA-West team instead, but the OUA-East team shall be the 'home' team and have last change.
University Cup tournament.
The eight teams to advance to the tournament are listed below. The three(3) conference champions must be seeded 1-3 based on the pre-tournament Top 10 Rankings followed by the OUA Runner-up (seed #4). The remaining four seeds are for the AUS Finalist, Canada West Finalist, OUA Third-place and host. Their seedings are based on the pre-tournament rankings.
Since UNB advancing as the AUS Champion, Acadia - as the AUS 3rd-place finisher (AUS Bronze), would take the place of the 'host'. To avoid a first round all-conference matchup between UNB and Acadia, Acadia #8 and Concordia #7 swapped seeds.
Tournament format.
The tournament is a traditional 8 team, single elimination ladder with Bronze Medal game between the two semi-final losers. Games that are tied after regulation play a 10-minute overtime period following the 3rd period. If there is no score after the first overtime, the ice is cleaned and they would play 20 minute periods (with ice cleaned between periods) until there is a winner.
The higher seed is the 'Home' team for each game (the home team must wear their 'white' jerseys and will get the last change during stoppages of play).
Tournament All-Stars.
Stephan Legault, from the Alberta Golden Bears, was selected as the Major W.J. 'Danny' McLeod Award for U Sports University Cup MVP. Stephan had 2 goals and 5 assist for 7 points in 3 games.
Joining Legault on the tournament all-star team were:&lt;br&gt;
Forward: Mark Simpson (UNB Varsity Reds)&lt;br&gt;
Forward: Michael Clarke (St. Francis Xavier X-Men)&lt;br&gt;
Defenseman: Jagger Dirk (St. Francis Xavier X-Men)&lt;br&gt;
Defenseman: Kendall McFaull (Saskatchewan Huskies)&lt;br&gt;
Goalie: Zach Sawchenko (Alberta Golden Bears)

The Sky ended June on a 3 game win streak with a 4–7 overall record. The winning streak didn't last long, as the team went 4–8 in July. All 4 July wins came against eventual playoff teams, but the Sky also had 4 losses against teams that would not end up in the playoffs. A 3–4 August meant the Sky missed the playoffs for the second straight year. They were 2 wins behind the 8th seed Dallas Wings.
On August 31, 2018, the Sky relieved Amber Stocks as head coach and general manager.

Biography.
Francisco Diego was born on October 26, 1991 in Torreón, Coahuila, México. At a very young age He moved to the historical city of Querétaro in Mexico where he started painting.
Influenced by his artistic background he left Querétaro to start his studies. He completed a Design degree at Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City and Politecnico di Torino in Turin, Italy.
He established his own studio in Mexico City.
Philosophy.
Life is like a white canvas, each line drawn, smooth or rough is an action taken. As in life, actions can’t be erased. The only thing to correct any misplaced stroke is to keep drawing and reinforcing the final silhouette. Aware of this poetic point of view about life, Francisco Diego only uses permanent black ink. If you stare closely at any Francisco Diego you might see all the previous strokes, making viewers wonder about the process of creation.

David Davies Memorial Institute

The David Davies Memorial Institute of International Studies, also referred to as the David Davies Memorial Institute (DDMI), is a think tank at Aberystwyth University in Aberystwyth, Wales in the United Kingdom. Found in 1951, the institute regularly publishes books, a journal, and hosts lectures annually lectures. The institute founded the "International Relations" journal (later acquired by SAGE Publications), to which the DDMI regularly contributes.
History.
The DDMI was established in 1951 to commemorate the legacy of Lord David Davies, 1st Baron Davies and his mission to promote a more orderly and just world through international cooperation, organization, and law. In 2001, the institute relocated from London to the department of International Politics at Aberystwyth University. The DDMI's research has evolved from efforts to understand important questions of disarmament and international organization to concentrations on security agendas, questions of global responsibility, and the status of the 'individual' in a world system of states.
Research.
The institute has on-going research projects led by its members.
Alliances and Trust Building in International Politics.
The Alliances and Trust Building project explores the question of trust in international politics. The project seeks to answer the following question: "How, and under what conditions, do alliances lead to the establishment of trusting relationships between states?" The project is a collaborative effort of the institute and other international relations professionals that focus on bilateral relationships within the NATO alliance. The project is funded by the British Academy and the Gwendoline and Margaret Davies Charity.
Key publications:
Harm in International Politics.
In this three-volume study, the problem of harm in global politics is explored. The project questions whether the human race has the capacity to control both non-violent and violent harm in politics. The volumes analyse the theoretical issues underlining the study of harm in international politics. The volumes consider the ways in which the Western international system has regulated harm, and the rise of cosmopolitan harm conventions. The research also explores the growth of human interconnectedness and emotional identification ranging from family ties to those of expansive nation-states. 
Emancipatory Realism.
This research project explores Ken Booth's work on the discipline of International Relations. It is informed by the various fields of International Relations, particularly those of International Relations Strategy, Security Studies, and Theory.

Transgender admissions policies at women's colleges

The admission of transgender students to women's colleges in the United States has been a subject of debate. Some colleges have changed their policy in favor of admitting transgender students, but there is little uniformity in definitional details.
Policy changes.
Smith College.
In 2013, high school senior Rose (then Calliope) Wong was denied acceptance to Smith College, one of the largest women's colleges in the United States, because she identified as a transgender woman. Wong marked her biological gender identity as male on her FAFSA, despite her self-identification as a woman. Subsequently, Smith deemed Wong inadmissible to the women's college and denied her application. Smith students, led by a trans-activist organization, Q&amp;A, protested the decision and began a Change.org petition encouraging Smith to revise their admissions policy to include trans women. Although Smith was not the first women's college to amend their admissions policy, Wong's story catalyzed a nationwide reconsideration of admissions policies at women's institutions. Smith College amended their policy to include admission of trans women in May 2015.
Others.
Mills College, located in Oakland, California, was the first women's higher education institution to formally publish an inclusive policy accepting transgender women in 2014. Since then, a total of 11 of the 39 Women's College Coalition (WCC) member institutions have revised their admissions policies to admit transgender women according to NBC News. The schools are as follows: Mills College, Mount Holyoke College, Simmons College, Scripps College, Bryn Mawr College, Wellesley College, Smith College, Hollins University, Barnard College, Bennett College and most recently Spelman College. Yet, the policies at each institution vary and lack uniformity.
Different policies at women’s colleges across the country.
Spelman College, the most recent women's institution to revise its admissions policy, determined the institution “will consider for admission women students, including students who consistently live and self-identify as women, regardless of their gender assignment at birth.” President of Spelman College, Mary S. Campbell, announced the revised admissions and enrollment policy in September 2017. The policy goes on to state that Spelman does not admit male students, regardless of their gender at birth; but, if a woman is admitted and decides to transition to male during their tenure at the college, they will be permitted to continue their studies and graduate from Spelman. Spelman College is one of only two Historically Black Women's Colleges in the nation. Bennett College, located in Greensboro, North Carolina, is the only other Historically Black Women's College in the nation and adopted a similar policy in January 2017.
Although Spelman College and other women's institutions across the country do not accept trans men, Mills College, the first women's institution to adopt “a formal admissions policy regarding transgender and transitioning,” does accept trans men. Yet, Hollins University, located in Hollins, Virginia, does not accept trans men nor allow for those who transition from female to male during their matriculation at Hollins to continue their studies or graduate. Additionally, Hollins accepts trans women, but clarifies the stipulations regarding their admission in the following, “trans women will be considered for admissions if they have completed physical sexual reassignment surgery and legal transformation from male to female.” Ultimately, the differences between the policies are determined by the individual institution's definition of womanhood and their varying degrees of inclusivity and/or exclusivity extended to the transgender community.
Challenges against evolving transgender admissions policies.
Although the exact number of trans women attending women's colleges nationwide is unknown, responses to the revised admissions policies have garnered mixed reactions over the past four years. Mills College, the first women's college to welcome trans students, reports approximately 8% of over 700 undergraduate students identify as transgender. Despite the low visibility of trans women at women's colleges, these institutions continue to face backlash and criticism, specifically from alumnae, who often believe the policies disregard and veer away from the core mission and purpose of women's colleges. Although majority of alumnae, current students and the institutions themselves agree women's colleges were created to educate and empower women, the discrepancies in defining and labeling womanhood fuel the differences in opinions and the revised policies themselves.
Furthermore, with the introduction and adoption of trans-inclusive admissions policies on these campuses, additional challenges include the day-to-day implementation of the policy, such as adequately providing academic and residential resources for trans students while ensuring a welcoming and inclusive collegiate environment. Trans students even face the possibility of potential physical harassment and other forms of discrimination on traditional college campuses.

1170 Syria earthquake

The 1170 Syria earthquake was one of the largest earthquakes to hit Syria. It occurred early in the morning of 29 June 1170. It formed part of a sequence of large earthquakes that propagated southwards along the Dead Sea Transform, starting with the 1138 Aleppo earthquake, continuing with the 1157 Hama, 1170 and 1202 Syria events. The estimated magnitude is 7.7 on the moment magnitude scale, with the maximum intensity of X ("extreme") on the Mercalli intensity scale.
Tectonic setting.
Western Syria lies across the boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate, which consists of the various segments of the Dead Sea Transform. The main strand passing through the Lebanon restraining bend is the Yammouneh Fault, which was responsible for the 1202 earthquake. To the north of this is the Missyaf Fault (or Ghab Fault), which continues up to the Ghab Basin. One earlier earthquake has been identified on this fault segment, the 115 Antioch earthquake. The Missyaf Fault is considered the most likely structure responsible for the 1170 event. The lack of any later major earthquakes on this segment suggests that one is now overdue.
Earthquake.
Due to the size of the area affected and the damage it caused, this earthquake is recorded in many contemporary accounts and appears in many more recent catalogues. There has been some confusion over the date, but there is a consensus now that it occurred on 29 June 1170. There is some uncertainty over the location of the epicentre and even whether it was two shocks or just one. The most likely location is on the Missraf segment of the Dead Sea Transform and the single earthquake appears most consistent with contemporary accounts. This implies a large area with high intensity of shaking and this has been used to suggest that the rupture was about 126 km long, involving more than just the Missraf segment, and that the magnitude was about 7.7 .
Several foreshocks were reported and the aftershocks sequence lasted for three months.
Damage.
Severe damage was widespread from Antioch in the north to Tripoli and Baalbek in the south. Several places that had been badly damaged by the 1157 Hama earthquake, suffered again, such as Hama, Aleppo and Antioch.
The fortress of Krak des Chevaliers (Hisn al‐Akrad) was badly damaged by the earthquake. Although the extent of the damage is unclear (one source says that no traces of the walls were left), the castle underwent major rebuilding in subsequent years.

Michael Matusevitch

Michael Matusevitch was a painter (1929 - 2007). He was born in Odessa, USSR (Ukraine in nowadays). 
Matusevitch started his painting career at school, where he was the class painter.
Wartime.
In 1941, Matusevitch and his brothers went for a summer vacation in the country with their grandparents. After two weeks, war broke out and it was impossible to return to his parents in Odessa, resulting in a long separation from their parents. The war period was hard. Matusevitch fled from the Nazis, making his way on foot and later by train, often exposed to bombing attacks. He passed cities in flames, suffered hunger and was wounded in the leg.
In the end, the group reached Tadzhikistan in Central Asia, and there Matusevitch finished grade school. The local population was made up of Moslems and a Russian minority, who suffered from an unfriendly, anti-Semitic and even cruel attitude, according to Matusevitch. 
Matusevitch spent many hours painting at that time; he made postcard copies of large paintings, and painted portraits from photographs. He tried to use oil colors for the first time, and since a few shades were missing, he mixed oil colors with gouache and acrylics. 
Matusevitch stood for hours watching the painters at work in the craft center beside his house.
Odessa.
At the end of the war, the family returned to Odessa in 1945. 
Matusevitch got a job as a welder in a factory, but he dreamed of being a painter, and to study in the Grekov Odessa Art school.
At the age of 19, Matusevitch passed the entrance examinations and was accepted despite heavy competition and the unofficial restrictions regarding Jews. His dream had come true. 
Matusevitch began his studies with great enthusiasm, but they were cut short in the middle of the first course, as he was recruited into the Red Army. Matusevitch served four years as a sailor on the Baltic Sea. He never saw his parents, but despite that, he used his time well in study, painting portraits of his friends and taking part in group exhibitions.
Study.
In 1953, Matusevitch returned to his study for an additional five years. The students were required to paint in the Socialist Realism mode, an outcome of the well-known slogan that the arts belonged to the people, and therefore the artist was the servant of the people. 
Modern art was avoided, as it was regarded as bourgeois and therefore unacceptable.
In 1958, Matusevitch finished his studies. His parents, with whom he lived, helped him devote much of his time to painting. On this he says: “It was always important to me to paint what was close to my view on life. I was in a large Soviet city and from a Jewish family. My point of view was in a measure Jewish. I saw the closely packed life of the Jewish street, and this helped me to describe in painting the special atmosphere of Odessa. Some blamed me for painting Odessa as a village and not as a modern, official Soviet city. But this was the Odessa I loved. I felt that this atmosphere, so unique, was gradually disappearing.”
Influential painter.
An important painter who greatly influenced Matusevitch was Vincent Van Gogh. When an exhibition of Van Gogh arrived in Moscow from the Netherlands, Matusevitch hurried to see it. He found many things in common with the great artist: an outlook of the world, a total devotion to art and also a ritual inclination in painting.
In 1962, Matusevitch participated in a group exhibition of Odessa artists. An article written on the exhibition noted and praised his painting: “A Spring Day with Horses.” 
Subsequently, the artist participated in many exhibitions organized by the confederation of painters in Odessa. The authorities were not enamored with his style and urged him to paint political subjects of note, but the public did like him very much, which was important for the artist. Pressure from the political establishment was the lot of many artists, among them several of Matusevitch’s friends: the painters Mezberg, Mazritsky, Ostrovsky, Shenkar and, closest to him, the excellent painter and poet, Sasha Richter.
Israel.
In 1974, he arrived in Israel and immediately felt a deep affinity with the landscape, as though he had been there before, and he depicted the country in paint. Here, Matusevitch met Rima Kravitz, a doctor who loved art. In 1975, he married her, and he relates: “Rima admires me and helps me. I give her the credit for many of my successes.“
Matusevitch received a warm welcome in Israel. A long list of exhibitions, a lecturer’s post at the People University and membership in the painters’ confederation, while he continued to create and establish himself in the Israeli family of artists.
In 1987, Matusevitch finally opened his own gallery in Tel-Aviv. He had people passing by, events, he sold some of his paintings, and he kept painting new ones. It was a dream that came true for Matusevitch.
Death and legacy.
Matusevitch died in 2007, after an illness he suffered for the last few years of his life. Matusevitch left behind him more than 400 paintings, which stayed since then in the gallery, that was close the whole time. Rima Kravitz, he's wife, didn't have the time and courage to manage the gallery, as a full time doctor, although she wanted very much.
In 2017, Matusevitch's grandson - Bar Matusevitch, in his twenties, decided to take responsibility for the gallery. As times changed, he created an online gallery, together with Rima, as they realized that was what Matusevitch would have want the most - all of his paintings are available worldwide - . It was a dream that came true for the Matusevitch family.

Alexander Nix

Alexander James Ashburner Nix (born 1 May 1975) is a British businessman, the former CEO of Cambridge Analytica and a former director of the Strategic Communication Laboratories (SCL) Group, a behavioural research and strategic communications consultancy, leading its elections division (SCL Elections). Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL were involved in psychological warfare operations for the British military and involved in influencing hundreds of elections globally; Cambridge Analytica helped Leave.EU with its Brexit campaign, according to both Leave.EU and Cambridge Analytica staff. The company was also engaged by the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns during the 2016 US presidential election. The company also ran Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta's campaign.
A member of the Ashburner-Nix family of Crawley, Nix grew up in Notting Hill, attended Eton and studied art history. Nix started his career as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico before moving to the strategic communication industry and joining SCL Group, a private intelligence company active in the military and political arenas founded by Nigel Oakes and whose president was former Conservative minister Sir Geoffrey Pattie; Nix's father was also a co-owner of SCL. In 2013 he became CEO of SCL's new subsidiary Cambridge Analytica. The men behind Cambridge Analytica and its parent SCL were described as having close ties to the Conservative Party (UK), the British royal family and the British military, and included some of the Conservative Party's largest donors, and former Conservative minister Jonathan Marland, Baron Marland. The company provided advice to the Foreign Office and Nix met with Boris Johnson in 2016.
Both in the UK and the US campaigns, Cambridge Analytica used private information from over 87 million Facebook users harvested from their profiles without permission. In 2018 Cambridge Analytica was dissolved after undercover video footage showed Nix claiming his company was using honey traps, bribery stings, and prostitutes, among other tactics, to influence more than 200 elections globally for his clients. In 2019 Nix and his colleague Aleksandr Kogan settled with the Federal Trade Commission, agreeing to delete previously obtained data; in 2020, Nix agreed to a disqualification undertaking prohibiting him from running U.K. limited companies for seven years after permitting companies to offer potentially unethical services, while denying any wrongdoing.
Background and early life.
Alexander James Ashburner Nix was born on 1 May 1975 to a banking family that belonged to the English landed gentry and had close ties to British colonial history both in the West Indies and British India, the Ashburner-Nix family of Crawley and London; Nix is mainly of English descent, and has some Black Jamaican ancestry in the 19th century as well as ancestors born in India and Peru. His father Paul David Ashburner Nix (1944–2006) was an investment manager who spent twenty-seven years with the M&amp;G Group before joining Consulta in 1995, and was a shareholder of SCL Group.
Alexander Nix grew up in Notting Hill, in West London, attended fee-paying Eton College, and studied art history at the University of Manchester. He started his career as a financial analyst with Baring Securities in Mexico for Robert Fraser &amp; Partners LLP, a tax and corporate finance firm. In 2003, Nix left finance to work in the strategic communication industry with the SCL Group.
Family and personal life.
In 2010 Nix married Olympia Paus, a wealthy Norwegian shipping heiress.
Career.
Cambridge Analytica.
In 2013, Nix set up Cambridge Analytica as an offshoot of the SCL Group, to target voters in "more than 40 political campaigns in the US, Caribbean, South America, Europe, Africa and Asia". The company ran Uhuru Kenyatta's presidential campaign in Kenya. In the United States, it was involved in the 2014 midterm elections and the 2016 presidential primaries and election, during which it received funding from the Mercer family. Nix's firm supported both the Ted Cruz and Donald Trump campaigns for the US presidency by using "psychographic" profiles of voters built on data harvested from Facebook.
In an exposé of the company, Nix was filmed stating that "we are not only the largest and most significant political consultancy in the world, but we have the most established track record. We're used to operating through different vehicles, in the shadows" and offered a "secretive relationship."
Before the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum, Nix's firm was involved in supporting Leave.EU with its Brexit campaign, according to both Arron Banks of Leave.EU, former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie, Cambridge Analytica's business development director Brittany Kaiser, and Leave.EU's communications director Andy Wigmore.
During Boris Johnson's tenure as foreign secretary, the Foreign Office sought advice from Cambridge Analytica and Boris Johnson had a meeting with Alexander Nix in 2016.
According to Wigmore, the work for Leave.EU was done "pro bono", without any money changing hand: "Because Nigel [Farage] is a good friend of the Mercers. And Robert Mercer introduced them to us. He said, 'Here's this company we think may be useful to you.' What they were trying to do in the US and what we were trying to do had massive parallels. We shared a lot of information. Why wouldn't you?" Behind Trump's campaign and Cambridge Analytica, he said, were "the same people. It's the same family."
In February 2018, Nix told the British parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee that his company had not received data from Facebook; following further media reports the committee's chairman, Damian Collins, said "We will be contacting Alexander Nix next week asking him to explain his comments." Nix denies deliberately misleading the parliamentary Select Committee.
In March 2018, "The Observer" reported that Nix talked "unguardedly about the company's practices" when he was secretly filmed by Channel 4 News reporters posing as prospective clients and that Cambridge Analytica was trying to stop the broadcast of the resulting programme. Nix offered "beautiful Ukrainian girls" to discredit political opponents in Sri Lanka. The secret filming was screened on 19 March as part of a 30-minute segment, with a follow-up scheduled for the next day, focusing on its involvement in the Trump campaign. The conversation appears to portray Nix including entrapment and bribery as potential Cambridge Analytica services.
On 20 March 2018, Nix was suspended from Cambridge Analytica.
On 11 April 2018, "The Wall Street Journal" published an article about the CEO position at Cambridge Analytica, saying Nix "has officially resigned from his position, according to a person close to the company", but also that a "company spokesman ... denied that Mr. Nix had submitted his resignation".
On 2 May 2018, Cambridge Analytica announced they were "closing and starting insolvency proceedings".
Christopher Wylie described Nix as "born in the wrong century" and "the type of person that would have been ideal at the height of the British Empire to go and become a governor of a colony, because he's the right station and class and went to Eton and all that."
On 8 October 2018, "The Guardian" reported that Nix referred to Mia Mottley, the elected Prime Minister of Barbados, and other government figures via the racial slur of "Niggers" in email communications.
Emerdata.
On 23 January 2018, Nix was appointed director of Emerdata Ltd., a new company incorporated in August 2017, along with SCL chairman Julian Wheatland and Cambridge Analytica chief data officer Alexander Tayler. On 16 March 2018, Rebekah and Jennifer Mercer were also appointed directors, members of the Mercer family which backed Cambridge Analytica financially (by at least $15 million, according to the New York Times). Another director of Emerdata is Chinese businessman , deputy chairman and executive director of Frontier Services Group, a private security firm which mostly operates in Africa and is chaired by US businessman and strong Trump supporter Erik Prince, who is best known for founding private military group Blackwater USA and being the brother of US education secretary Betsy DeVos. On 13 April 2018, Nix's role of director was terminated.
FTC settlement and disqualification from running UK limited companies.
In 2019 Nix and his colleague Aleksandr Kogan settled with the Federal Trade Commission, agreeing to delete previously obtained data.
In 2020 Nix signed a disqualification undertaking, accepted by the UK Secretary of State on 14 September 2020. The Insolvency Service commented that "Within the undertaking, Alexander Nix did not dispute that he caused or permitted SCL Elections Ltd or associated companies to market themselves as offering potentially unethical services to prospective clients; demonstrating a lack of commercial probity." The unethical services offered included "bribery or honey trap stings, voter disengagement campaigns, obtaining information to discredit political opponents and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns." Effective from 5 October 2020, Alexander Nix is disqualified for seven years from acting as a director or directly or indirectly becoming involved, without the permission of the court, in the promotion, formation or management of a UK company. Nix said he had made "no admission of wrongdoing" or broken any laws.
In popular culture.
Nix has been compared to "a Bond villain" with "the sinister-sounding surname, the cut-glass accent and his position at the centre of a conspiracy theory involving Brexit, Trump and dodgy data."
Nix is portrayed by Paul Bettany in an upcoming film on the Cambridge Analytica affair produced by the Russo brothers.

Bedlam (2015 video game)

Bedlam is a first-person shooter game developed by British studio RedBedlam and published by Standfast Interactive. It was released on October 13, 2015 for PlayStation 4 and October 16, 2015 for Xbox One. Based on the novel "Bedlam" by Christopher Brookmyre, it follows an ordinary Scottish woman named Heather Quinn who is trapped inside the body of a video game character and must fight her way through several environments inspired by 1990s and 2000s first-person shooter games.
The game received mixed to negative reviews from critics, who praised its comedic writing but criticized its lackluster gameplay and high amount of bugs.
Plot.
The game follows a digital simulation of Heather Quinn, a.k.a. Athena, an employee at an artificial intelligence technology company whose mind has been uploaded to a network of simulated fictional video games, primarily first-person shooters. The game takes place within and between these fictional games, among which her fellow employees' minds have been scattered. Some time after their uploading, the company shifted its focus to military application, and is now secretly using these games as training grounds to that end. The player helps Heather's former colleagues to fight against a villainous force known as the Integrity, which is destroying game worlds in order to locate and extract their consciousnesses for later use. After a final confrontation with the Integrity, revealed to be controlled by their boss, he escapes from the game network to an unknown destination, and Heather follows.
Gameplay.
The game plays in a similar manner to a 1990s first-person shooter, prioritizing constant movement and dodging rather than the use of a cover system. Gameplay is largely unchanged throughout different environments, game worlds that pay homage to FPS franchises like "Quake", "Medal of Honor", and "", as well as real-time strategy games and classic arcade games.
Development.
The game was created as a tie-in with the novel, "Bedlam", featuring a similar concept of a person being transported inside a video game. It was intended as the first game in a trilogy of both novels and games.
The release of the game forced another game called "Bedlam" to change its name to "Skyshine's Bedlam".
Reception.
"Bedlam" received mixed to negative reviews, with an aggregate score of 53/100 on Metacritic for the PlayStation 4 version.
Ben Tyrer of GamesRadar+ rated the game 3/5, calling its world and story "immensely likeable", and its protagonist "one of the most engaging I've witnessed in some time", but noting the amount of "technical and gameplay issues", including "major glitches" that caused important story elements to be skipped and disrupted gameplay. He called the game's shooting mechanics "bland", criticizing slow character control despite the "blindingly fast" movement and weak-feeling guns.
Jaz Rignall of USGamer rated the game 50/100, saying that while the game's concept was "absolutely brilliant", it failed in the execution, having "stiff, unforgiving gameplay" such as "finicky aiming and shooting", "punishing checkpoints" and "awkward difficulty spikes". He noted that it seemed like the developer "bit off more than it could chew". Sammy Barker of Push Square rated it 4/10, saying that the biggest problem with the game is that "you'll wish it was so much better", praising its "razor-sharp commentary" and "fascinating plot" but saying that its "rotten first-person shooter" gameplay did not do it justice, and comparing the guns to "a spud gun loaded with mud".

Raid on St. John (1775)

The Raid on St. John took place on 27 August 1775 during the American Revolutionary War. The raid involved American privateers from Machias, Maine attacking St. John, Nova Scotia (present day New Brunswick). The privateers intended to stop the export of supplies being sent to the loyalists in Boston. This raid was the first hostile act committed against Nova Scotia and it resulted in raising the militia across the colony.
Background.
During the American Revolution, Americans regularly attacked Nova Scotia by land and sea. American privateers devastated the maritime economy by raiding many of the coastal communities, such as the numerous raids on Liverpool and on Annapolis Royal.
In June 1775, the Americans had their first naval victory over the British in the Battle of Machias. In response to this defeat, in July 1775, the British sent two armed sloops, "Diligence" and "Tatamacouche" from Halifax to punish the Americans. On 12 July 1775, the British vessels confronted O'Brien in "Unity" and "Portland Packet" in the Bay of Fundy, where the Americans took the British ships. The Machias Committee of Safety sent Captain Stephen Smith to capture the brig "Loyal Briton" at St. John, which was loading cattle and other supplies for the Army at Boston. 
Battle.
On 27 August 1775, Captain Stephen Smith, in a 4-gun American privateer from Machias, along with 40 men raided St. John and burned Fort Frederick and took the brig "Loyal Briton" under the command of Captain Frederick Sterling. The brig had 120 tonnes of sheep and oxen for the British forces in Boston. He also took a corporal and two privates, with two women and five children prisoner. John Anderson Esqr was also on board the brig. The brigantine was owned by John Sempill (Semple) and the navigator was David Ross, who both escaped. The prisoners were released at Boston and sent back to St. John.
Aftermath.
Captain Edward Le Cras of HMS "Somerset" and HMS "Tartar" proceeded immediately to Annapolis Royal to protect the town. The Governor requested two sloops-of-war to patrol the Bay of Fundy. Admiral Samuel Graves assigned Captain William Duddingston of HMS "Senegal" to the task. Graves also sent Le Cras to protect Halifax for the winter. Governor Legge of Nova Scotia also called up militias from across the colony to be stood up.
In retaliation for the raid on St. John, the British executed the Burning of Falmouth. American privateers remained a threat to Nova Scotian ports for the rest of the war.

Christopher Wylie

Christopher Wylie (born 19 June 1989) is a Canadian data consultant who previously worked at Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm led by Alexander Nix.
In 2018, he released a cache of documents prompting the Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal, giving "The Guardian" documents that described the secret workings behind Cambridge Analytica. The documents were centered around Cambridge Analytica's alleged unauthorized possession of personal private data from up to 87 million Facebook user accounts, which was obtained for the purpose of creating targeted digital advertising campaigns. The campaigns were based on psychological and personality profiles mined from the Facebook data which Wylie had commissioned in a mass-data scraping exercise.
Wylie's revelations triggered government investigations on both sides of the Atlantic and raised wider privacy concerns. He appeared in the 2019 documentary "The Great Hack"; his book "Mindf*ck: inside Cambridge Analytica's plot to break the world" was also published in 2019. The book omits any mention of his company Eunoia.
Wylie was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018."
Early life.
Wylie was born to parents Kevin Wylie and Joan Carruthers, both physicians. He was raised in Victoria, British Columbia. As a child he was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD. After being abused at the age of 6 by "a mentally unstable person", he successfully sued the British Columbia Ministry of Education after a six-year legal battle, winning a settlement of $290,000 at the age of 14. He left school in 2005 at the age of 16 without a qualification, and when asked about his "probable destiny" on his school leaver's yearbook page, he stated "just another dissociative smear merchant peddling backroom hackery in its purest Machiavellian form".
Liberal Party of Canada, 2005-9.
After leaving school, Wylie moved to Ottawa, where he began volunteering for "a short stint" in the parliamentary office of his Member of Parliament, Keith Martin. During his time in Martin's office, he overlapped with Martin's executive assistant Jeff Silvester, who was later commissioned by Wylie to set up AggregateIQ The following year, he got a job in the office of the Canadian opposition leader, Michael Ignatieff, at the age of 17. He subsequently "lost his job" in 2009 "in large part because he was pushing a nascent form of the controversial data-harvesting technique. At the time, the idea was viewed as too invasive and raised concerns with the Liberals, who declined to have anything to do with it. Wylie's recommended data-collection approach spooked party officials", CBC reported, quoting one Liberal Party colleague as saying "Let's say he had boundary issues on data even back then. He effectively pitched an earlier version of exactly this [the Cambridge Analytica data-harvesting operation] to us back in 2009 and we said, 'No."' 
Obama campaign, 2008.
In 2008, he volunteered on the presidential campaign of Barack Obama, learning about microtargeting from Obama campaign adviser Ken Strasma, although there has been some dispute over whether he held a senior campaign role as sometimes claimed, or held "a junior-level data entry role" as a volunteer. He claims to have taught himself to code at age 19.
LSE, and UK Liberal Democrats.
In 2010, at the age of 20, he began studying law at the London School of Economics, graduating with an LLB in 2013, specialising in technology, media and IP law, and being awarded the Dechert Prize for Property Law. During his time as a student, he had worked as a microtargeting and digital campaigns strategist for the Liberal Democrats in the UK, although his fixed-term contract was not renewed - one former colleague explained "We did not renew his contract because he is a compulsive bullsh*tter and doesn’t know what he’s talking about". In 2013 he enrolled for a PhD in predicting fashions trends at the University of the Arts London, but subsequently dropped out when working for SCL Elections. He later completed a master's degree in Political Management at George Washington University in Washington D.C.
SCL Elections/Cambridge Analytica, 2013-14.
Work at SCL.
In 2013, Wylie began working as a contractor for SCL Elections, and its offshoot for American elections (later renamed Cambridge Analytica), an international consultancy specialising in data-driven psychographic targeting in elections.
Wylie's role at SCL was first revealed in May 2017 by "The Observer" journalist Carole Cadwalladr, who wrote that "He’s the one who brought data and micro-targeting [individualised political messages] to Cambridge Analytica". Describing his role as being the company's "director of research", Wylie worked with Cambridge University academic Aleksandr Kogan to illegally scrape the personal data of 87 million people from their Facebook profiles, and used the data to develop new forms of psychographic microtargeting.
During his time at SCL, Wylie worked for American Republican candidates affiliated with the party's "Tea Party" wing in the 2014 United States elections; and on disinformation campaigns for political parties in Nigeria, Kenya, Ghana and the Caribbean. Wylie's research work included message-testing work for Steve Bannon on building a wall on the American-Mexican border, and he later recounted, "My ears perked up when I [later] started hearing some of these things like 'drain the swamp' or 'build the wall' or 'the deep state' because these were all narratives that had come out from the research that we were doing," and that the wall "is not really about stopping immigrants. It's to embody separation. If you can embody that separation and you can further distance in the minds of Americans us here in America and them elsewhere, even if it is just across a river, or just across a desert, then you have won that culture war."
Departure from SCL.
Wylie ceased working with SCL in 2014 to found his own company, Eunoia Technologies. A subsequent QC's report by Julian Malins, based on access to SCL/Cambridge Analytica's records, queried substantial parts of Wylie's account of his time at SCL, and the timing and circumstances of his departure. It states that he was never the company's "director of research" as claimed (a role which did not exist within the company), but that his employment contract made it clear that he was hired as a part-time "intern" on a student visa, limited to 19 hours of work a week; it queried his claim that he worked at the company until late 2014, quoting his resignation emails which stated that he left on 10 July 2014; it concludes that there was no evidence to support his claim to being a "founder" of Cambridge Analytica; and that contrary to his claims to have resigned in disgust at the company's practices, contemporary correspondence "does not suggest that, at least as at the end of his engagement with SCL, he had any qualms about the work he had been doing at SCL or helping others to do."
Upon departing from SCL in 2014, Wylie took with him several hundred pages of sensitive company documents, along with a copy of the complete Facebook dataset of 87 million individuals. At a 2018 Q&amp;A session, "Wylie appeared visibly wrong-footed when asked why he had obtained so much compromising material on Cambridge Analytica prior to his departure, and why he held onto it for three years, and seemed to visibly struggle to provide any clear answer."
Eunoia Technologies, 2014-17.
In 2014, Wylie co-founded Eunoia Technologies along with former SCL/Cambridge Analytica senior staff Brent Clickard, Mark Gettleson and Tadas Jucikas. In describing his ambitions for developing Eunoia, Wylie stated "I want to build the NSA’s wet dream". 
Eunoia Technologies has been criticized for the similar psychographic profiling tactics used by Cambridge Analytica, using the same dataset shared by Alexander Kogan.
In December 2014, Wylie registered Eunoia Technologies Inc in the tax haven of Delaware. In May 2015, a wholly owned UK subsidiary of Eunoia was registered in the UK as Eunoia Technologies Ltd. The name "Eunoia" meant "beautiful thinking" in ancient Greek, and the company offered election-related consultancy services including "psychographic microtargeting", "multi-agent system voter behaviour simulation", and "data &amp; communications management".
Wylie's lawyer subsequently assured journalists that Eunoia had no data, but parliamentary testimony from Dr Kogan later revealed that Eunoia had possessed Kogan's full data set of 87 million Facebook users; and that SCL/Cambridge Analytica had only ever had access to some 4% of the scraped data, "in contrast with the contract with Mr. Wylie’s entity
Eunoia, where Eunoia received all of the page like data as well as dyads", and that unlike SCL/Cambridge Analytica, Wylie's company had been the only organization Kogan granted complete access to the dataset.
Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2015.
During the Easter of 2015, two of Wylie's Eunoia colleagues who had joined him from SCL, Tadas Jucikas and Mark Gettleson, flew to New York to meet Donald Trump's then-campaign manager on his 2016 presidential bid, Corey Lewandowski, for a meeting in a Central Park hotel. They pitched for Eunoia to work on the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, but were ultimately unsuccessful. The approach to the Trump campaign was made with Wylie's knowledge as CEO of Eunoia, and reportedly had his blessing.
Liberal Party of Canada, 2015.
In November 2015, Eunoia Technologies pitched Facebook data-mining techniques to the Liberal Party of Canada, securing a $100,000 contract in January 2016 for "a short-lived pilot project" with the Liberal Caucus Research Bureau. However, the contract was not renewed beyond the pilot.
EU Referendum campaign, 2016.
Wylie has repeatedly denied having had any involvement in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union referendum, describing himself as "A Eurosceptic, but I wouldn’t call myself a Brexiteer", and pointing to his having been abroad at the time of the referendum - although he has conceded that most of the key personnel involved in the Vote Leave campaign's digital and campaign financing controversies were all friends or colleagues of his, including BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, BeLeave Treasurer Shahmir Sanni, AggregateIQ founders Zack Massingham and Jeff Silvester (a company set up at Wylie's instigation when he was SCL's director of research), and Vote Leave HQ staffer Mark Gettleson (who recruited AggregateIQ to work for Vote Leave), with Sanni and Gettleson later becoming witnesses in criminal investigations of the Vote Leave campaign.
It subsequently emerged that in January 2016, Wylie and Gettleson wrote a joint proposal, on behalf of Eunoia, to Vote Leave campaign Director Dominic Cummings, to pitch for a pilot providing microtargeting services to the Leave campaign in the 2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum. The pitch was ultimately unsuccessful, with Cummings later describing them as "charlatans". Gettleson subsequently admitted that they had only made the pitch to Vote Leave after first making a pitch to the opposing Remain campaign in November 2015.
It was subsequently reported that on the morning of the referendum result, Wylie posted the "Brexit butterfly" graphic to his social media in support of Brexit, along with the caption "We did it", tagging four individuals: Conservative MP Nigel Evans of the Vote Leave campaign board; BeLeave founder Darren Grimes, later found guilty by the Electoral Commission of using BeLeave as a vehicle for illegally breaking campaign spending limits; and Leave campaigners Luis Lopez and Shahmir Sanni, with the latter later becoming a "whistleblower" on Vote Leave's campaign finance breaches.
Eunoia litigation with SCL/Cambridge Analytica, and closure.
From 2015, Wylie and Gettleson became embroiled in litigation with Cambridge Analytica's parent company, the SCL Group, with SCL alleging that Eunoia had infringed SCL's intellectual property, had misappropriated SCL's data, had attempted to 'poach' other SCL contractors, and had attempted to 'poach' SCL's clients. Wylie elaborated on the Eunoia allegations when denying them: "They tried to sue me over their claims that I was somehow trying to steal their clients, or to somehow try to interfere with their contractual relations with other employees, or what have you." SCL later claimed that Eunoia had been "the subject of restraining undertakings to prevent the misuse of the company's intellectual property". A QC's report noted:
Eunoia Technologies Ltd was voluntarily wound up in October 2017, with accounts running up to 31 May 2016.
Whistleblower.
On the 18 March 2018, Wylie gave a series of detailed interviews to "The Observer" with revelations about his time at SCL/Cambridge Analytica, presenting himself as a "whistleblower". He subsequently provided testimony and materials to a range of inquiries and legislatures around the world, and his revelations were instrumental in the May 2018 collapse of Cambridge Analytica. Wylie admitted to having been the principal anonymous source for a May 2017 "The Observer" article by Carole Cadwalladr, which first drew attention to Cambridge Analytica. Cadwalladr subsequently related how she had tracked Wylie down via LinkedIn in early 2017, and after finding him "fascinating, funny and brilliant", had spent a year persuading him to go public with his allegations.
On March 27, 2018, Wylie provided evidence to the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee of the UK Parliament that contained further revelations about the practices at Cambridge Analytica and its associated companies.
In an interview with "The Guardian", Wylie stated that Rebekah Mercer "loved the gays, and so did Steve Bannon. He figured if you could get the gays on board, everyone else will follow...(like the) Milo Yiannopoulos thing".
His memoir "Mindf*ck: inside Cambridge Analytica's plot to break the world" was published in 2019.
Post-whistleblowing career.
On 1 December 2018, Wylie was hired by H&amp;M as its consulting director of research.
Wylie criticised Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook's role in spreading religious intolerance in Sri Lanka. Moulavi Zahran Hashim, a radical Islamist imam believed to be the mastermind behind the 2019 Sri Lanka Easter bombings, preached on a pro-ISIL Facebook account, known as "Al-Ghuraba" media.
Personal life.
Wylie is self-described as gay and vegan.

Pseudocentrotus depressus

Pseudocentrotus depressus, commonly known as the pink sea urchin, is a species of sea urchin, one of only two species in the genus "Pseudocentrotus". It was first described in 1864 by the American marine zoologist Alexander Agassiz as "Toxocidaris depressus", having been collected during the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition undertaken by Captain Cadwalader Ringgold and later Captain John Rodgers.
Description.
This sea urchin is distinctive in its shape, with the oral (lower) surface being flat and the aboral (upper) surface markedly depressed in the centre. The tubercles are numerous and even in size, and the spines are fine and short, their diameter being about a quarter of their length. The inter-ambulacral plates are broad and the pore pairs are arranged in slightly curved groups of six or seven pairs.
Ecology.
As is the case with most other sea urchins, the sexes are separate in this species, and adults liberate eggs and sperm into the water column. After fertilisation, the echinopluteus larvae spend several months swimming and drifting with the plankton. Metamorphosis is stimulated by the detection by the larvae of suitable locations to settle on the seabed, cues being provided by the presence on the substrate of films of micro-algae or of microbes. In the absence of a suitable habitat, the larvae can continue swimming, but metamorphosis will eventually happen even in the absence of these cues.
Uses.
"P. depressus" is used for human consumption and is the most important species of sea urchin in the southern Japan fishery.

Zoë Marieh Urness

Zoë Marieh Urness (born 1984) is a photographer of Alaskan Tlingit and Cherokee Native American heritage.
Biography.
Urness was adopted, with her twin sister, by their Norwegian great-great uncle and aunt in Stanwood, Washington, and was introduced to tribal arts and history at the Alaskan Native American Cultural Association. She received her first camera from her grandmother at age seven. "The camera allowed me to relate to people," Urness says. "The subjects were endless and I explored them through the lens." She earned art degrees from Skagit Valley College and the former Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, California.
After graduating college in 2008, Urness freelanced in Santa Barbara and Seattle, shooting for "Outside" and "Trend" magazines. In 2014, she created a Kickstarter project with "an emphasis on the critically endangered languages captured with video and still imagery" and began photographing tribes across the country, including visits to the Havasupai at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, the Hopi at Second Mesa, the Apache Crown Dancers at Monument Valley, and Alaskan natives at the Biennial Celebrations in Juneau.
Urness showed her Alaskan work at the Indigenous Fine Art Market and twice at the Santa Fe Indian Market in 2014, winning "Best in Division" and "Best in Category"; the images were also recognized by the California-based Autry Museum of the American West, the Art Basel fair in Miami and the Heard Museum Guild Indian Fair and Market in Arizona. She has also shown at Photo L.A. SPECTRUM, Native Treasures Indian Arts Festival, and co-owns the ZOHI Gallery in Santa Fe. Her photograph "Dec. 5, 2016: No Spiritual Surrender", at the Oceti Sakowin Camp on Standing Rock Sioux Reservation at the Dakota Access Pipeline Protests, was entered for a Pulitzer Prize in Feature Photography by "World Literature Today", where it appeared on the cover of the magazine's May 2017 issue, "New Native Writing: From Wounded Knee to Standing Rock." From her artist's statement, her work aims to send the message, "We are here. And we are thriving, through our traditions."

Oren Burks

Oren Spencer Burks (born March 21, 1995) is an American football linebacker for the Green Bay Packers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Vanderbilt, and was drafted by the Packers in the third round of the 2018 NFL Draft.
High school.
Burks attended South County High School in Lorton, Virginia. Rated as a 3-star prospect out of high school, Burks committed to Vanderbilt over other offers from Duke, Maryland, Boston College, and others.
College career.
In a game against Kentucky during his second year, Burks intercepted 2 passes, one of which was returned for a touchdown. This feat caused him to become the SEC defensive player of the week. Following his senior season, Burk was also invited to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl as an alternate.
Professional career.
The Green Bay Packers selected Burks in the third round (88th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Green Bay Packers traded their fourth (101st overall) and fifth round (147th overall) picks in 2018 to the Carolina Panthers in exchange for the Panthers' third round pick which they used to select Burks. Burks was the 12th linebacker drafted in 2018.
On May 17, 2018, the Green Bay Packers signed Burks to a four-year, $3.43 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $820,756.
Burks entered training camp slated as a backup inside linebacker. He competed against Antonio Morrison to be a starting inside linebacker after Jake Ryan sustained a torn ACL during training camp. Burks sustained a shoulder injury during pre-game warmups before the start of the Packers' third preseason game at the Oakland Raiders and was subsequently inactive for the first two regular season games (Weeks 1–2). Head coach Mike McCarthy named Burks a backup starting inside linebacker, behind Antonio Morrison, upon his return from injury. On September 23, 2018, Burks made his professional regular season debut and recorded two combined tackles during a 31–17 loss at the Washington Redskins in Week 3.

Dark Age (collectible card game)

Dark Age is an out-of-print collectible card game by Friedlander Publishing Group (FPG), originally released in July 1996. The game shared themes with the Mad Max franchise and featured work from artists such as Gerald Brom and Tim Bradstreet. 
FPG intended for Dark Age to be released as three compatible stand-alone games. The first stand-alone set titled "Feudal Lords" contained 231 cards, and was sold in 65-card starter decks and 10-card booster packs. Two promo cards were also available. The second stand-alone set, called "The Brood," was planned to be released in October 1996 with 225 cards, but never entered production. "The Brood" had artists returning from "Feudal Lords," and was focused on growth numbers used to increase a Brooder's size (a Brooder was a genetically engineered creature run amok). 
A third expansion was scheduled for a 1997 release, but also never made it to production.

Aga Syed Mustafa began studying the Quran and theology from a young age and was assisted in his religious studies by his grandfather Aga Syed Muhammad, his father Ayatullah Aga Syed Ahmad, his uncle Aga Syed Yousuf, and Haji Amin Sahab. At the age of 22 years he lost his father Aga Syed Ahmed Al-Moosavi, people chose Aga Syed Mustafa as Aga Syed Ahmad's successor but Mustafa refused to accept the role, wanting his uncle Aga Syed Yousuf as the successor of his father. He entrusted the family affairs to his uncle who took over the traditional responsibilities performed by the Aga family. Aga Syed Mustafa went to Hawza 'Ilmiyah Najaf, Iraq for higher studies to fulfill his late father's wish. He was edified by Al-Haaj Aga Syed Abul Hassan Mashadi, Al-Uzma Al-Haaj Hazrat Aga Syed Mohsin Al-Hakeem Tabatabie, Aga Buzurg Tehrani, Mohammad Fazel Lankarani, Abdullah Sharudi, Mohammad Hadi Milani.

Football League 100th Championship Challenge

The Football League 100th Championship Challenge was a football match organised by the Football League and played to commemorate the 100th edition of the Football League First Division being completed. It was played between the winners of the competition's 100th edition, and the record winners of the competition at the time. It was held at the Stadium of Light on 18 May 1999, two days after the end of the Premier League season. The match was played between Sunderland, champions of the 1998–99 Football League First Division (the second-tier of English football at the time), and Liverpool, 18-time Football League champions (all first-tier titles).
Sunderland took an early lead through Allan Johnston's curling effort, but a penalty from Robbie Fowler and a close-range finish from Jamie Redknapp put Liverpool 2–1 in front. Sunderland brought the game back level via a Kevin Phillips header, but the Reds restored their lead within a minute when Paul Ince saw his deflected shot hit the back of the net. This proved to be the decisive goal as Liverpool won 3–2 to claim the glass trophy in front of a crowd of 18,111.
Background.
The match was announced in a press conference on 30 April 1999 in the presence of Sunderland manager Peter Reid and Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier, to celebrate 100 editions of the Football League First Division. The game was scheduled for 18 May 1999, two days after Liverpool's final match in the 1998–99 Premier League. The match was billed as being Steve McManaman's final game in a Liverpool shirt as he was to join Real Madrid at the end of the season, however McManaman was forced to withdraw due to the death of his mother. The winners of the game were to receive a trophy made from glass, while the match was also given its own logo featuring the colours blue, red and white. Liverpool's line-up for the game was: Brad Friedel, Rigobert Song, Dominic Matteo, Phil Babb, Jamie Carragher, Jamie Redknapp, Paul Ince, David Thompson, Patrik Berger, Karl-Heinz Riedle and Robbie Fowler.
Post-match.
Sunderland manager Peter Reid expressed worry about the potential length of the injury suffered by their top scorer Kevin Phillips during the game, stating "We are just hoping it's a few torn fibres instead of a full-blown hamstring tear". Phillips was able to recover in time for the following season where he would end up winning the Premier League Golden Boot and the European Golden Shoe.

New City (band)

NEW CITY (stylized in all caps) is a Canadian Pop Rock-Electronic trio based in Toronto, Ontario – consisting of Chase Ellestad (vocals, piano, production), Jed Webster (guitar, production) and Nathan Brown (drums, production). The band previously included Adrian Mitchell (vocals) before he left the group at an unknown time in 2019.
In 2017, the band released their first-ever song, "Coachella," a summertime anthem about the Indio, California music festival. The track has since amassed almost two million streams, including almost 1.5 million streams on Spotify, with Clash magazine declaring it a "perfect pop confection." New City released a music video for the track, with the band channeling party atmosphere of the desert festival – despite never having been.
The follow-up, the Deep House-inflected "Dirty Secrets," was the #1 Most Added CANCON single at Canadian Pop Radio on week of release. The track entered the Canadian radio chart at number 22, jumping seven spots in just two weeks and clearing four million streams, "With the irresistible pop sensibilities of New City," wrote Billboard, "they are a secret you'll want to share."
History.
Formed in 2017, out of two separate projects. Webster and Brown are lifelong friends who grew up together in the small farming community of Sussex, New Brunswick; Webster's influences included blues guitar heroes (Stevie Ray Vaughan, B.B. King, Muddy Waters), while Brown was more focused on rock groups before discovering electronic music in high school. The pair took a big leap and moved to Toronto when they met R&amp;B fan Mitchell, who was born in Oro-Medonte in central Ontario and was trying to make it as a solo artist, at a hotel party and quickly joined forces.
As of 2019, Mitchell was released from the band with reasons unannounced, the band parted ways with their Canadian label Universal Music Canada shortly after.
Musical style.
NEW CITY's music style has been described as electropop, pop, synth-pop.

Yashua Klos

Yashua Klos (born 1977) is an American visual artist best known for his innovative large-scale collage works which address issues of identity, race, memory and community.
Early life and education.
Klos was born in Chicago, Illinois, where he grew up on Chicago's South Side and was raised by his single mother. In 2000, he earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at Northern Illinois University. Klos then studied abroad in France, where he investigated Renaissance painting techniques at L'Atelier Neo Medici in 2002. By 2009, he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree at Hunter College.
Art.
Klos's work is influenced by his childhood growing up on Chicago's South Side. His work commonly explores themes surrounding African-American identity in contemporary society. Through his large-scale collages, Klos challenges notions of marginalization, masculinity, and urban mythology. He paints portraits of people from Chicago's South Side, highlighting narratives of suppression, denial, and pain associated with the vulnerability experienced in black communities. There was a "stoicism" among the "black folks" Klos witnessed, an element he attempts to unpack by studying the behavioral nature of adapting and thriving. Overall, he challenges conventions often attached to the African-American man.
Klos is represented by Jack Tilton Gallery.
Printmaking.
In his earlier works, Klos was known for printing giant woodcuts on large stretches of muslin. His interest in the technique grew out of the many African-American activists who employed it during the mid-20th century, such as Charles White, Elizabeth Catlett, and Emily Douglas. By cutting and etching using a series of erratic, jagged marks, he imitates this "kinetic devotion to image-making" that grounds this element of humanity he desires to achieve.
Collage.
Klos's collages derive from his practice as a printmaker. Using a personalized approach, he creates swatches and samples of textures by hand-carving and inking woodblock prints to create a library of source material. By piecing and arranging a selection of patterns, they are layered on top of a pencil blueprint to create a complete portrait. His ideas of memory and distortion are demonstrated by the manifestation of fractured impressions and angled perspectives. Klos views collage as more than just a technique, but more a "metaphor for the fragmentation of African-American identity".
Sculpture.
Klos references earthly materials, physical mediums he views as strong yet vulnerable over the passage of time. He associates timelessness to ancient monuments, an concept he applies to his sculptures to communicate the "monumentality of a culture's identity and relationship to time". Often, he incorporates materials leftover from urban renewal, such as milk crates, bricks, and wooden beams. The use of these mediums suggest Klos' desire to construct an identity relevant to his background.
Selected exhibitions.
Klos is represented by Tilton Gallery (New York) and Galerie Anne de Villepoix (Paris).
Teaching.
Yashua Klos teaches regularly at Hunter College and Parson's

Brock is also an accomplished jazz musician. He was the founding bassist of the Vijay Iyer Trio, lead by the acclaimed jazz pianist Vijay Iyer.
He is married and has three children.
Research.
Jeffrey Brock's research focuses on low-dimensional topology and geometry, particularly on spaces with hyperbolic geometry or negative curvature. His joint work with Richard Canary and Yair Minsky resulted in a solution to the "Ending Lamination Conjecture" of William Thurston, culminating in the geometric classification theorem for (topologically-finite) hyperbolic 3-manifolds in terms of their fundamental group and the structure of their ends.
More recently, he has worked to understand applications of geometry and topology to the structure of massive and complex data sets and the risks and implications of the increasing use of 'black box' algorithms in science and society.

The Kitchen (2019 film)

The Kitchen is a 2019 American crime film written and directed by Andrea Berloff in her directorial debut. It is based on the DC/Vertigo Comics limited series of the same name by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle. The film stars Melissa McCarthy, Tiffany Haddish, and Elisabeth Moss as the wives of Irish mobsters who take over organized crime operations in New York's Hell's Kitchen in the late 1970s, after the FBI arrests their husbands. The film also features Domhnall Gleeson, James Badge Dale, Brian d'Arcy James, Jeremy Bobb, Margo Martindale, Common, and Bill Camp in supporting roles.
Produced by New Line Cinema, Bron Creative, and Michael De Luca Productions, the film was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures. It received mostly negative reviews from critics, who criticized the convoluted plot, and grossed $16 million against its $38 million budget, making the film a box-office bomb.
Plot.
In Hell's Kitchen 1978, three women are married to members of the O'Carroll crime family. Kathy is married to Jimmy, a kind man who is increasingly disillusioned with the mob; Ruby is married to Kevin, the son of boss Helen O'Carroll; and Claire is married to Rob, who frequently beats and abuses her.
One night, the men are arrested in a sting by FBI agents and are each sentenced to three years in prison. Jack "Little Jackie" Quinn assumes Kevin's role in the family and assures the wives that they'll be cared for, but provides them barely enough to live on. When the women discover that many of the businesses that pay the family protection money are upset with Little Jackie forcing them to pay more, they persuade the owners to start paying them instead and provide other favors for their neighbors, making a profit and earning the respect of the community. Jackie finds out and confronts the women, but is subsequently assassinated by Gabriel O'Malley, a disgraced Irish mob enforcer called in by Ruby. With Jackie out of the way and Gabriel backing them up, the women effectively control the family, while Gabriel and Claire begin a relationship.
After successfully "persuading" the local Jewish community to only hire Irish Union workers to construct their buildings, the women are ordered to meet with Alfonso Coretti, the head of Brooklyn's Italian mafia who is furious with the Irish encroaching on his territory. He insists that they start dealing with him and reveals that their husbands are set to be released in four months, which they hadn't realized. Knowing that they are in a precarious position, Coretti says he'll support them and split control of the city in return for Italians getting construction jobs in Hell's Kitchen. The women agree knowing they have no other choice. Ruby subsequently kills Helen in a rage when she learns that her mother-in-law disapproves of her being married to Kevin and would almost certainly force him to divorce her when he returns.
Four months pass and the husbands are released; Kevin is determined to reassert his power as Helen's heir, Jimmy pressures Kathy to help him leave their life of crime and start over, and Rob is furious that Claire has left him for Gabriel. When Rob strikes Claire for refusing to take him back, she pulls a gun from under her pillow and kills him. Coretti then contacts the women and warns them that Kevin, backed by other members of the family, has ordered them to be whacked for the deaths of Helen and Rob. Ruby then pays the Coretti family to have her husband and his friends murdered, but Kathy makes her drop Colin, who she is fond of, from the list. The hit goes through, but Claire is then killed by Colin in an act of revenge.
After Claire's funeral, Kathy realizes that Ruby has been secretly keeping an FBI agent on the family's payroll. Ruby explains that she set up their husbands to be arrested, as Kevin refused to let her have a role in the family. Kathy later finds that Jimmy is being sheltered by the Coretti family and taken their children with him out of anger for Kathy not respecting his wishes and not treating him as an equal in their relationship. Feeling betrayed, Kathy informs Coretti that her husband no longer has the family's protection, and Jimmy is whacked.
Ruby asks Kathy to meet her so they can discuss what to do next. When Kathy arrives, she finds that Ruby is waiting with Gabriel to kill her so she can take over as sole boss. Having anticipated this, Kathy reconciles with the O'Carroll family and brings all of their muscle as backup to the meeting. Gabriel admits that with Claire dead, he no longer has any ties to the mob and deserts Ruby. Kathy tells Ruby that from now on, they will share the responsibility of leading the family. The film ends with Kathy and Ruby making plans to expand their territory to Uptown.
Production.
In February 2017, Andrea Berloff signed on to direct an adaptation of "The Kitchen", a Vertigo comic book miniseries by Ollie Masters and Ming Doyle. Berloff had already been commissioned to write the screenplay for the film, but she impressed executives at New Line Cinema, the film's production company, with her "edgy and subversive" perspective. The film is her directorial debut.
In November 2017, Tiffany Haddish, off of a breakthrough performance in "Girls Trip", signed on as one of the film's three female leads. In February 2018, Melissa McCarthy came on board for another lead role, and in March 2018, Elisabeth Moss was cast as the last of the three leads, while Margo Martindale, Bill Camp, and Brian d'Arcy James were also added. In April 2018, Domhnall Gleeson, Common, James Badge Dale, Jeremy Bobb, and Alicia Coppola joined the cast, and in May 2018, James Ciccone was added as well. Coppola did not appear in the finished film.

Release.
"The Kitchen" was released on August 9, 2019, by Warner Bros. Pictures.
Reception.
Box office.
In the United States and Canada, "The Kitchen" was released alongside "Dora and the Lost City of Gold", "The Art of Racing in the Rain", "Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark" and "Brian Banks", and was projected to gross $9–14 million in its opening weekend. Playing at 2,742 theaters, it was the smallest wide release of McCarthy's career. After making $1.8 million on its first day, estimates were lowered to $5–6 million. The film ended up debuting to $5.5 million, the worst opening weekend of both McCarthy and Haddish's careers. The film dropped 60% in its second weekend to $2.2 million before being pulled from 2,125 theaters in its third weekend and making just $342,506. "The Hollywood Reporter" estimated the film would lose "tens of millions" for the studio, although noted it could find success in home media.
Critical response.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 24% based on 229 reviews, with an average rating of 4.60/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "With three talented leads struggling to prop up a sagging story, "The Kitchen" is a jumbled crime thriller in urgent need of some heavy-duty renovation." On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 35 out of 100, based on 42 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews." Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B–" on an A+ to F scale.
"Variety"s Owen Gleiberman described the film as "just like "Widows", except not as good." Gleiberman was critical of the script but praised McCarthy's fierce performance, wished Tiffany Haddish had more to do, and that Margo Martindale had a bigger role. Ty Burr of "The Boston Globe" wrote, "There's only one Scorsese, and he ain't here."
Mick LaSalle of the "San Francisco Chronicle" wrote: "Speaking of female gangsters, no review of "The Kitchen" should overlook Margo Martindale, who steals every scene she's in as a mob matriarch – a gravelly voiced monster with a gutter mouth and a big photo of John F. Kennedy on her wall. Martindale gets to be evil and has as much fun onscreen as she can without smiling."

Platanthera carnosilabris

Platanthera carnosilabris is a species of flowering plant in the orchid family Orchidaceae, native to south-central China (north-west Yunnan).
Taxonomy.
The species was first described by Tsin Tang and Fa Tsuan Wang in 1940, as "Herminium carnosilabre". A molecular phylogenetic study in 2014 found that it was deeply embedded in a clade of "Platanthera" species, and so it was transferred to that genus as "Platanthera carnosilabre".

USL.
Match results.
In August 2017, the USL announced that the 2018 season would span 34 games, the longest regular season the league had ever run. The expansion was spurred by the addition of six new clubs for the 2018 season: Atlanta United 2, Fresno FC, Indy Eleven, Las Vegas Lights, Nashville SC, and North Carolina FC.
On January 14, 2018, the league announced home openers for every club. Orange County opened the season with a home match against Phoenix Rising, marking the first season-opening match to ever be played at Championship Soccer Stadium. In 2017, the club played its first four matches on the road before getting to open the new stadium on May 6.
The schedule for the remainder of the 2018 season was released on January 19. Orange County played three times against both LA Galaxy II and Phoenix. They played every other Western Conference team twice.
