2018 Tour of Oman

The 2018 Tour of Oman was a road cycling stage race that took place between 13 and 18 February 2018 in Oman. It was the ninth edition of the Tour of Oman and was rated as a 2.HC race as part of the 2018 UCI Asia Tour. The previous year's winner, Ben Hermans, did not defend his title.
The race was won by Kazakh cyclist Alexey Lutsenko, as part of .
Teams.
Eighteen teams were invited to take part in the race. These included nine UCI WorldTeams and nine UCI Professional Continental teams.
Classification leadership table.
There were five principal classifications in the 2018 Tour of Oman.
The first and most important was the general classification; the winner of this was considered the overall winner of the race. It was calculated by adding together each rider's times on each stage, then applying bonuses. Bonuses were awarded for coming in the top three on a stage (10 seconds for the winner, 6 seconds for the second placed rider and 4 seconds for the rider in third) or at intermediate sprints (3 seconds, 2 seconds and 1 second for the top three riders). The rider in the lead of the general classification wore a red jersey.
The second competition was the points classification, calculated by awarding points for the top 10 riders at the finish of each stage (15 points to the winner down to 1 point for the rider in tenth place) and to the top three at intermediate sprints (3 points, 2 points and 1 point). The rider with the highest points total was the leader of the classification and wore a green jersey. The young rider classification was open to those born on or after 1 January 1992. The young rider ranked highest in the general classification was the leader of the young rider classification and wore a white jersey.
The combativity classification was based on points won at intermediate sprints and classified climbs along the route. Points were awarded to the top three riders across each sprint or climb (3 points, 2 points and 1 point). The rider with the most accumulated points was the leader of the classification and wore a white jersey with red and green polka dots. The final competition was the team classification. On each stage, each team was awarded a time based on the cumulative time of its top three riders; the times for each stage were then added together and the team with the lowest total time was the leader of the team classification.

Mariama Jamanka

Mariama Jamanka (born 23 August 1990) is a German bobsledder who won Gold in the two-woman event with Lisa Buckwitz at the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Career.
A former discus and hammer thrower of Berlin, Jamanka became a bobsledder in 2013. She entered the Bobsleigh World Cup during the 2015–16 season. In January 2017 she won the European Championship in Winterberg with brakewoman Annika Drazek. Later the same year she was part of the gold-winning German team in the mixed team event at the IBSF World Championships in Königssee.
Before the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, Germany's head coach René Spies changed the brakewomen of the country's two leading two-women bobsleighs: Drazek was assigned to pilot Stephanie Schneider, while Jamanka had to work with Schneider's former brakewoman Lisa Buckwitz, with Schneider and Drazek being the most aspiring German team for the Pyeongchang Games. However, Jamanka and Buckwitz won the event, winning Germany's first two-woman bobsleigh medal since 2006, while Schneider and Drazek, who both became injured during the Games, finished fourth.

Lisa-Marie Buckwitz (born 2 December 1994) is a German bobsledder. She competed in the two-woman event at the 2018 Winter Olympics and won the gold medal.
Career.
Buckwitz started off as a heptathlete. Buckwitz took up bobsleigh in 2013, and trains at the club. She won two junior championships. 
In 2015, Buckwitz and Cathleen Martini won the two-woman Bobsleigh World Cup event in Königssee. In 2016, Buckwitz and Stephanie Schneider won a bronze medal in the two-woman at the Bobsleigh European Championship, and came fourth in the two-woman event at the IBSF World Championships in Igls, Austria. In 2017, Buckwitz, Christopher Grotheer, Stephanie Schneider, Tina Hermann, Nico Walther and Philipp Wobeto won the silver medal in the mixed team event at the IBSF World Championships in Königssee. They finished behind another German team.
At the beginning of the 2017-18 season, German bobsleigh coach René Spies paired Buckwitz with Mariama Jamanka. The pair were nicknamed the "Berlin Bob", as Buckwitz and Jamanka are both from Berlin. Buckwitz and Jamanka won a silver medal at the 2018 Bobsleigh European Championships. At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Buckwitz and Jamanka competed in the two-woman event and won the gold medal. The win was unexpected, as the other German bobsleigh, containing Stephanie Schneider and Annika Drazek, was the favourite to win. German teams won all three of the bobsleigh events at the Games, and Buckwitz was the first person from Schöneiche to win an Olympic gold medal. As a result of her Olympic win, Buckwitz was awarded the Silbernes Lorbeerblatt (Silver Laurel Leaf), and was voted Brandenburg's Sportswoman of the Year.
Buckwitz and Jamanka won the opening race of the 2018–19 Bobsleigh World Cup in Sigulda, Latvia. Buckwitz also now competes in monobob events.

Drumbeagh

Drumbeagh () is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Corlough and barony of Tullyhaw.
Geography.
Drumbeagh is bounded on the north by Gubrawully townland, on the west by Altinure, Tullandreen, Tullynamoltra and Corraclassy townlands and on the east by Curraghabweehan, Derryvahan and Drumcar (Kinawley) townlands. Its chief geographical features are the Owensallagh river (A source of the River Blackwater, County Cavan), forestry plantations, a stream and dug wells. Drumbeagh is traversed by the R200 road (Ireland) and rural lanes. The townland covers 187 statute acres.
History.
In the Plantation of Ulster by grant dated 27 February 1610, along with other lands, King James VI and I granted one poll of "Drombeagh and Corroboan to William O'Shereden, gentleman, Cheefe of his Name". William Sheridan was the chief of the Sheridan Clan in County Cavan. He was the son of the previous chief, Hugh Duff O'Sheridan of Togher townland, Kilmore parish, County Cavan. William was the ancestor of the famous Sheridan theatrical family. William died sometime before 1638 leaving two sons, Owen (of Mullaghmore, Tullyhunco) and Patrick (of Raleagh townland, Kildallan parish). Owen Sheridan succeeded to his father's lands. Owen's son Denis was born in 1612 and became a Catholic priest in charge of Kildrumferton parish, County Cavan. He later converted to Protestantism and on 10 June 1634 William Bedell, the Protestant Bishop of Kilmore, ordained him as a Minister of the Church of Ireland and two days later Denis was collated to the Vicarage of Killasser in the Diocese of Kilmore. Denis had several children, including William Sheridan (Bishop of Kilmore and Ardagh) 1682-1691 (his son Donald kept up the Templeport connection by marrying Mrs Enery of Bawnboy); Patrick Sheridan, Cloyne, Protestant Bishop of Cloyne (1679-1682) and Sir Thomas Sheridan (politician) Chief Secretary of State for Ireland (1687-1688).
The Sheridan lands in Drumbeagh were confiscated in the Cromwellian Act for the Settlement of Ireland 1652 and were distributed as follows:
The 1652 Commonwealth Survey lists the townland as "Drombeagh" and the proprietor as "Lieutenant-Colonel Tristram Beresford". A further confirming grant dated 3 November 1666 was made by King Charles II of England to the aforementioned Sir Tristram Beresford, 1st Baronet included, inter alia, 76 acres and 3 roods in "Curraghboghan and Drumbeagh". By grant dated 11 September 1670 from King Charles II of England to said Sir Tristram Beresford, the lands of "Curraghbegan and Drumbeagh" were included in the creation of a new "Manor of Beresford".
A deed dated 30 April 1740 by Thomas Enery includes: "Drombeagh". 
A deed by Arthur Ellis dated 19 Mar 1768 includes the lands of "Drumbeagh".
A deed by Gore Ellis dated 24 Feb 1776 includes the lands of "Drumbeagh".
The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as "Drombeagh".
A map of the townland drawn in 1813 is in the National Archives of Ireland, Beresford Estate Maps, depicts the townland as "Drumbaugh".
The Tithe Applotment Books for 1827 list ten tithepayers in the townland.
The Drumbeagh Valuation Office Field books are available for September 1839.
In 1841 the population of the townland was 87, being 47 males and 40 females. There were fifteen houses in the townland, all of which were inhabited.
In 1851 the population of the townland was 82, being 47 males and 35 females, the reduction being due to the Great Famine (Ireland). There were fifteen houses in the townland, all were inhabited.
Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists twenty-three landholders in the townland.
In 1861 the population of the townland was 68, being 34 males and 34 females. There were fourteen houses in the townland and all were inhabited.
In the 1901 census of Ireland, there are seven families listed in the townland,
 and in the 1911 census of Ireland there are eleven families listed in the townland.
A description of Drumbeagh in the 1930s by Emily Montgomery is available at-

Impact of war on children

The number of children in armed conflict zones are around 250 million. They confront physical and mental harms from war experiences.
"Armed conflict" is defined in two ways according to International Humanitarian Law: "1) international armed conflicts, opposing two or more States, 2) non-international armed conflicts, between governmental forces and nongovernmental armed groups, or between such groups only."
Children in war-zones may act as perpetrators, becoming child soldiers. It is estimated that there are around 300,000 child soldiers around the world and 40 percent of them are girls. Children are also victims of armed conflicts. They are forced to evacuate, suffer from sexually transmitted diseases and are deprived of education opportunities.
Background.
The presence of children in the war can go back to Middle Ages and Napoleonic Wars. Children fought in the American Civil war, significantly contributed to the Battle of New Market which was fought in Virginia (May 15, 1864). Children were also fighting in the World War II, especially noted to serve as "Hitler Youth". However, in modern days, the number of child victims is increasing as the proportion of civilian casualties is also increasing. In 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, about half the war victims were civilians while it was almost 90 percent by the end of the 1980s. Children compose a large part of the population affected by wars, data from the American Psychological Association show of the 95 percent of civilians killed in recent years’ by modern armed conflicts, approximately 50 percent of them were children.
According to United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the estimated casualties of children during the last decade was: "2 million killed, 4–5 million disabled, 12 million left homeless, more than 1 million orphaned or separated from their parents, and some 10 million psychologically traumatized". Currently, there are over two million child refugees fleeing from Syria and over 870,000 refugees from Somalia. Among 100,000 people who have been killed in Syria, at least 10,000 were children.
Potential risk factors of war on children.
Direct exposure to violence.
Death and injury.
By being directly exposed to violence such as bombing and combats, children are killed during conflicts. In 2017 alone, there were 1,210 terrorist attacks around the world, mostly happening in Middle East region and 8,074 fatalities. There were nine terrorist incidents with more than hundred deaths in conflict zones. Under the Trump administration, civilian casualties from the United States armed forces are at all-time high in Syria and Iraq. Also, children are more likely to be injured by landmines. Twenty percent of landmine victims are children in mine-affected countries. They are often intrigued by colorful appearance of landmines and explosives. Children can lose sights or hearing; lose body parts; suffer from the trauma. At least 8,605 people were killed or injured by landmines in 2016 and 6,967 casualties in 2015. Most of them were civilians and 42 percent of civilian casualties were children and the number of child casualties were at least 1,544 in 2016.
Sexual violence.
The United Nations define the term "conflict-related sexual violence" as "rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, forced pregnancy, forced abortion, enforced sterilization, forced marriage, and any other form of sexual violence of comparable gravity perpetrated against women, men, girls or boys that is directly or indirectly linked to a conflict". More than 20,000 Muslim girls and women have been raped in Bosnia since 1992. Many cases in Rwanda show that every surviving adolescent girl was raped. Sexual violence also causes sexually transmitted diseases – such as HIV/AIDS – to spread. One of the factors is involvement with military forces as they sexually abuse and exploit girls and women during conflicts. Besides, as HIV-positive mothers give birth to HIV-infected children without anti-retroviral drugs, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS tend to spread fast.
Unmet basic needs during warfare.
War disrupts the supply of necessities to children and their families like food, water, shelter, health services, and education. Lack of access to these basic needs may deprive children of their physical, social-emotional, and psychological development. In case of South Sudan, constant violent conflicts along with climate shocks greatly damaged the agriculture-based economy. As a result, more than 1.1 million children are suffering from severe food shortages. In countries across Africa and the Middle East, over 2.5 million children are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. Economic sanctions such as trade restrictions from international community and organizations may play a role in serious economic hardship and deterioration of infrastructure in armed conflict zones. This makes it extremely difficult for children to survive as they are usually in the most bottom level of socioeconomic status. As of 2001, around half a million Iraqi children were predicted to be dead due to sanctions regime.
Detrimental parenting behavior can also affect child development. In a war context, families and communities are not able to provide an environment conducive to the children's development. Mike Wessells, Ph.D., a Randolph-Macon College psychology professor with extensive experience in war zones explained; "When parents are emotionally affected by war, that alters their ability to care for their children properly. War stresses increase family violence, creating a pattern that then gets passed on when the children become parents." Scarcity of resources increases cognitive load which affects attention span, cognitive capacity, and executive control that are critical abilities to reason and solve problems. Reduced mental and emotional capabilities caused by stress from a war can degrade their parenting capabilities and negatively change behaviors towards children.
Disruption of education also occurs with the destruction of schools during wars. The human and financial resources are compromised during crisis. The United Nations reported that more than 13 million children are deprived of education opportunities and more than 8,850 schools were destroyed because of armed conflicts in the Middle East. According to UNICEF report, In Yemen, 1.8 million children were out of education in 2015. Between 2014–2015, almost half a million children in Gaza Strip were not able to go to school because of the damages on schools. In Sudan, more than three million children cannot go to school because of the conflicts. In Mozambique, around 45 percent of primary schools were destroyed during the conflict. Fear and disruption make it hard for children and teacher to focus on education. This generates an educational gap, depriving children of essential education, building social-emotional skills, and thus reintegrating into society. In addition, gender equality can also be compromised as education disruption in armed conflict zones generally excludes girls.
Impact on psychological development of children.
Brain development.
Early childhood experience accounts for a large part of human brain development. Neural connections for sensory ability, language, and cognitive function are all actively made during the first year for a child. The plasticity and malleability which refer to the flexibility of the brain is highest in the early brain development years. Therefore, the brain can be readily changed by surrounding environments of children. In that sense, children in armed conflict zones may be more susceptible to mental problems such as anxiety and depression, as well as physiological problems in the immune system and central nervous systems.
Stress in early childhood can impede brain development of children that results in both physical and mental health problems. Healthy brain and physical development can be hampered by excessive or prolonged activation of stress response systems. Although both adrenaline and cortisol help prepare the body for coping with stressors, when they are used to prolonged and uncontrollable stress, this stress response system can lead to impairments in both mental and physical health.
Lack of basic resources may also impede child brain development. Childhood socioeconomic status influences neural development and affects cognitive ability and mental health through adult life. Especially, poverty is regarded to deteriorate cognitive capacity. Many studies have shown that poverty in early childhood can be harmful in that poor families lack time and financial resources to invest in promoting child development. This suggests that the serious deprivation of resources in armed conflict zones is extremely detrimental to cognitive development of children during warfare.
Okasha and Elkholy (2012) have theorized that psychological immunization can help children who are frequently exposed to conflict to better acclimate themselves to the stressors of war.
Attachment theory.
Children who are detached from a family in early age may go through problems regarding attachment. Children under five are more likely to experience a greater risk of depression and anxiety compared to adolescents. Attachment theory suggests that the ability of a child to create attachment can be deterred by deviant environmental conditions and reflected experiences with caregivers. Different types of attachments can be formed with different caregivers and upbringing environment. In addition, different experiences of attachment in childhood are known to be related to mental health issues in adulthood.
Other psychological impacts.
Children in war-zones witness and experience horrendous violent activities which may lead to development of psychological disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). By 2017, 3 million children from Syria have witnessed effects of war directly. 80% of the 94 Iraqi children exposed to the Feb 13, 1991 bombing showed PTSD symptoms. Also, study shows that 41 percent of Palestinian children from Gaza Strip suffered from PTSD. The incidence of the effects of war has a 10 to 90 percent variation in terms of developing PTSD, depression and behavioral problems. PTSD is known to have intergenerational effects.
Rehabilitation issues.
Reintegration into society for child soldiers.
There are around 300,000 child soldiers around the world.
Disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) programs are conducted to rehabilitate child soldiers and war-affected children.
The creation of DDR in Sierra Leone was led by UNICEF in 1999. However, disarmament consistently failed to attract female combatants who were forced to provide sexual services as they were too afraid to step forward for demobilization process.
Child soldiers are often stigmatized and confronted with discrimination from community. Reintegration and rehabilitation depends on the level of violence occurred in the region, acceptance from family and community, and resources like education and training programs to recover war-affected youth. The Paris Principles suggest extensive and detailed guidelines on reintegration of children associated with armed forces or armed groups.
Psychological treatment process.
Psychological treatment is considered to be more challenging after the age of five. This is because the plasticity of the brain reduces after the age of five since much of the brain's development occurs before the age of six. Long-term psychological treatment is many times required. Some children develop resilience and are able to overcome significant adversity. Helpful community surroundings and stable caregivers are regarded as being able to build capacity to recover from adverse childhood experiences.
Intervention programs for children in war-zones.
Narrative exposure therapy.
Narrative exposure therapy is a short-term individual intervention for treatment of PTSD based on the cognitive-behavioral exposure therapy. KidNET is a narrative exposure therapy used with war-affected children aged 12–17 years. Under this, the mental health professional encourages the patients to describe the events of their life – from birth till present. Improvements through KidNET are seen in the refugee children in eastern Europe, children affected by the Rwandan genocide, and the children in Sri Lanka. 
Testimonial psychotherapy is another short-term individual treatment for the war-affected individuals in which they record their experiences with trauma. These recordings are then later analyzed by doctors along with the patients to understand how the personal experiences are connected to trauma.
Dyad Psychosocial Support.
Dyad psychosocial support is a family-level treatment for mother and children affected by war aiming at the emotional and psychological development of children. One example of the program was carried out in Bosnia for a duration of 5-month in which weekly meetings of the mothers were carried out to discuss their children’s development, coping mechanisms, and trauma. This program indicated net positive results in terms of the "maternal mental health, children's weight gain, and children's psychosocial functioning and mental health".
Youth Readiness Intervention Program.
Youth Readiness intervention program (Sierra Leone) is aimed at youth in the war to treat emotional and psychological issues and inculcate pro-social behavior in them. A study by Betancourt et al. evaluates results from Sierra Leone. It reports positive results.

SMS "G194" was a "S-138"-class large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy. She was built by the Germaniawerft shipyard at Kiel between 1910 and 1911, and was launched on 25 May 1911, entering service later that year. She served throughout the First World War, taking part in the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914. She was rammed and sunk by the British light cruiser on 26 March 1916.
Construction and design.
The Imperial German Navy ordered 12 large torpedo boats ("Große Torpedoboote") as part of the fiscal year 1910 shipbuilding programme, with one half-flotilla of six ships ordered from Germaniawerft and the other six ships from AG Vulcan. The two groups of torpedo boats were of basically similar layout but differed slightly in detailed design, with a gradual evolution of design and increase in displacement with each year's orders.
"G194" was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load.
Three coal-fired and one oil-fired water-tube boiler fed steam at a pressure of to two sets of direct-drive steam turbines. The ship's machinery was rated at giving a design speed of , with members of the class reaching a speed of during sea trials. 145 tons of coal and 76 tons of oil fuel were carried, giving an endurance of at , at or at .
The ship was armed with two 8.8 cm L/45 guns, one on the Forecastle and one aft. Four single 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes were fitted, with two on the ship's beam in the gap between the forecastle and the ship's bridge which were capable of firing straight ahead, one between the ship's two funnels, and one aft of the funnels. The ship had a crew of 84 officers and men.
"G194" was laid down at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard as Yard number 153 and was launched on 12 January 1911 and completed on 2 August 1911.
Service.
On commissioning, "G194" joined the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, and remained part of the 2nd Half Flotilla in 1914.
On 28 August 1914, the British Harwich Force, supported by light cruisers and battlecruisers of the Grand Fleet, carried out a raid towards Heligoland with the intention of destroying patrolling German torpedo boats. The German defensive patrols around Heligoland consisted of one flotilla (the 1st Torpedo Flotilla) of 12 modern torpedo boats forming an outer patrol line about North and West of Heligoland, with an inner line of older torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division at about . Four German light cruisers and another flotilla of torpedo boats (the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla) was in the vicinity of Heligoland. "G194", a member of the 2nd Half Flotilla of the 1st Torpedo Flotilla, formed part of the outer screen of torpedo boats.
At about 06:00 on 28 August, "G194" spotted the periscope of the British submarine , one of three submarines deployed as bait to lure the German torpedo boats away from Heligoland. Shortly afterwards "E7" fired a torpedo at "G194" which missed. "G194" reported by radio her encounter with the British submarine to Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass, the commander of the German torpedo boat forces, aboard the cruiser back at Wilhelmshaven. As a result of this report, the 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla was ordered out to hunt the hostile submarine.
At 07:57 "G194" was fired on by British warships, and while returning fire, turned away to the south east towards Heligoland, pursued by the British destroyers , , and . The 5th Flotilla and the old torpedo boats of the 3rd Minesweeping Division also came under British fire, and were only saved by the intervention of the German cruisers and , with the torpedo boats , and "T111" damaged.
The Torpedo boat , leader of the 1st Flotilla, trying to return to Heligoland on hearing gunfire, ran into the midst of the Harwich force and was sunk. The intervention of the supporting British forces resulted in the sinking of the German cruisers , "Cöln" and . The British light cruiser and destroyers , and were badly damaged but safely returned to base. "G194" was undamaged.
In August 1915 the Germans detached a large portion of the High Seas Fleet for operations in the Gulf of Riga in support of the advance of German troops. It was planned to enter the Gulf via the Irbe Strait, defeating any Russian naval forces and mining the entrance to Moon Sound. "G194" was deployed in support of these operations.
On 25 March 1916, the British seaplane carrier , escorted by the Harwich force, launched an air attack against a Zeppelin base believed to be at Hoyer on the coast of Schleswig. The raid was a failure, with the airship base actually at Tondern, and the British destroyer was rammed by the destroyer . Forces of the High Seas Fleet went to sea in response to the air raid, and German torpedo boats were ordered to search for "Medusa", which had been slowly towed towards home in poor weather, but unknown to the Germans, had later been abandoned. During the night of 25/26 March, and "G194" suddenly encountered units of the Harwich force. The light cruiser rammed "G194", cutting the torpedo boat in two and sinking her, killing all 93 of "G194"s crew. In doing so, "Cleopatra" cut across the bows of the cruiser , which rammed "Cleopatra", damaging both cruisers.

She rose to fame with her debut album "Wake Up Daddy!" which is a duet album with her father Graham, a legendary Burmese pop singer. She was born and raised in Myanmar and later at the age of 10, moved to Australia with her family for her studies.
Life and career.
1996–2013: Early life and living abroad.
Pan Yaung Chel was born to Graham and Thin Zar Oo in Yangon, Myanmar on 14 January 1996. She became the elder daughter of her family when her little sister Pan Thun Chel was born on the same day as her birthday in 2001. She grew up in Myanmar and studied in international schools in Yangon. She released her first ever song, "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star", in Yin Mar Record Label's Children's Songs album at the age of 9.
Later at the age of around 11, Pan Yaung Chel and her family moved to Perth, Australia for her and her little sister's education. In 2012, when Pan Yaung Chel was still in high school, her father, mother and her little sister returned to Myanmar while she stayed behind in Australia to continue her education. She went to continue her secondary studies at St Brigid's College, an independent Roman Catholic, day and boarding school for girls, where she graduated as the class of 2013. In March 2013, Graham held his solo concert in Yangon, she sang Adele's "Someone Like You" at her father's concert, where she was praised for her singing abilities.
2014–2017: Career beginnings with "Wake Up Daddy!".
After high school she went onto study Architecture at The University of Western Australia. But before she began studying at the university, Pan Yaung Chel took a gap year in 2014 where she worked on her debut album "Wake Up Daddy!" together with her father, Graham.
The most popular track of the album was "Wake Up Daddy!" which was loved by many, from children to teenagers, to the adults. It was known for being the song that children fans of both Graham and Pan Yaung Chel sing to their fathers in the mornings when they wake them up. The song was based on the real life experience Pan Yaung Chel and her family had in Australia, while they were living there. The DVD of the album came out nearly two years later, on 21 December 2016, with 14 music videos inside.
2018–present: New music.
Pan Yaung Chel has been stating in her current interviews that she is going to release her first solo album mid 2018 at the latest. She released her first single for 2018 – "Butterflies", written together with her father, on 9 February through her Facebook page and YouTube channel. Her second single for 2018 came out on 16 March, titled "You Set Me Free" and was written by herself. Five days later, she also released a dance practice video of the song on her Facebook page and YouTube channel. On 17 November 2018, Pan Yaung Chel released a music video for her first single "Let It Go" which is one of the tracks in her upcoming solo album. The music video became widely popular since the day she released it on her official Facebook page and YouTube channel, and was praised for the quality and input of the cast and production team involved in this music video. The music video was an action-based music video where Pan Yaung Chel got to show her acting skills and a tough side of her for the first time to the public by playing the character of a police woman who was in love with a drug dealer, who was played by Daung.

Series 2 (2019).
Episode 1: The Sale: 2 August
With their sunset retirement together waiting on the sale of his house, Phil despairs of finding the right estate agent. The current one, Roland Percy, suggests an open day, but Phil baulks at the idea. Edith, meanwhile, is heartened to find that her son Roger is earning some sort of a living even if it is only busking with her old flame Bob the Burglar, and performing a ventriloquist act with his stuffed toy crocodile Methuselah. Sandra is becoming impatient with Roger's ex-wife Wendy's need for company and steers her to the local community centre where she suggests she may find something to keep her busy. Queenie confesses to Edith that she cannot bear the thought of her going away, and when she hears that plans are currently stalled by the difficulty of selling Phil's house, she sees her chance to influence events. She recruits Sandra to help talk Phil into having an Open Day after all. Jack Dugdale, walking his St Bernard dog Bertie, stops for one of his usual chats with Phil and hears the latest on his plans for his and Edith's future. They discuss Roger's well-being, and Dugdale wonders if being left in charge of Edith's house might be the making of him. Roger and Bob take their busking to the naked ladies fountain at York House, but the police chase them away and Bob collapses. Dugdale, a retired medic, comes to the rescue, and calls an ambulance. Phil gives in to the general persuasion that he should hold an open day, and Queenie makes sure he will personally attend and persuades Roger that some entertainment would not go amiss. Wendy explores possibilities at the community centre and takes to the creative writing class. When viewers arrive at Phil's house they find Roger busking off-puttingly on the doorstep and, as they treat themselves to Sandra's lavish hospitality, Queenie plants rumours about damp and evil spirits. Edith and Phil turn up to find his house invaded by doubtfully gossiping freeloaders, the estate agent happily over-indulging on free wine, and Roger cavorting in a rabbit costume. Phil shouts at the viewers, who then leave. Later Edith, Sandra and Queenie are all laughing about the disastrous day when suddenly they realise Phil has disappeared.
Episode 2: The Disappearance: 9 August
Phil's house has been withdrawn from the market by his estate agent, who thinks he is insane, and he has not turned up for his regular morning meeting with Edith. As she and Sandra hurry to Phil's house, Edith receives a phone call from her sister Joan inviting herself to stay. Meanwhile, Roger is visiting Bob in hospital. He tells Bob that he has thought of a new way to make money and has let his mother's spare room, online, to two Americans. Bob's estranged goth daughter Georgie arrives from Glasgow to see how he is, and Roger takes a shine to her. As she has nowhere to stay, he offers her his room. Then, as he is making up the sofa for himself in the sitting room, Joan arrives demanding the spare room. Edith returns home to find her house full of unexpected guests and her demanding sister. Dugdale finds Phil, who is admitted to hospital, before walking out and going home. 
Episode 3: Aunty Joan: 16 August
Phil discusses his ongoing house sale difficulties with Dugdale, who is glad that he has recovered after last week's disappearance and says he might be interested in buying the house. Phil imparts this good news to Edith, along with the bad news that a surveyor has found dry rot. Edith's sister Joan joins them and it is clear that she and Phil get along no better than she and Edith. Joan advises Edith against moving to Gozo with Phil. Joan frequently promises people bequests in her will. Roger visits Bob at his temporary digs, a caravan by the river, and tells Bob about Phil's dry rot. Bob persuades him that this is the sort of thing surveyors make up, and they should inspect it themselves. But as Roger and Bob explore the attic, Phil arrives with prospective buyer Dugdale in tow. During the viewing, Roger falls halfway through the ceiling of the master bedroom. Phil tells Edith about the accident.
Episode 4: The Lemming Family: 23 August
Edith and Phil discover a local bookshop hosting a local author, Wendy Stevens, who is signing her first book, The Lemming Family, which is for children. Thrilled that Wendy's writing ambitions have come to fruition, Edith steers Phil into the shop to congratulates her, but Wendy seems alarmed at the prospect of Phil reading the book. Over a coffee immediately afterwards, Edith and Phil are outraged to find out that the characters in the book are thinly disguised portrayals of themselves and the family. Roger continues to busk by the riverside with Bob, and is horrified to spot among the crowd a familiar face: Mrs Pool, the woman from social services, with whom Roger had a run-in when he fraudulently applied to be a paid carer for his mother, impersonated by Queenie. Roger is hopeful that he has another opportunity to be paid carer. However, him being pleased at his application for carer being accepted turns to being horrified when he finds out that it is demanding Joan whom he will be caring for, at her house. 
Episode 5: Damage Limitation: 30 August
With her annoying sister Joan safely packed off home, Edith is thrilled when Phil announces that Jack Dugdale has made an offer on his house, which he has accepted. Edith and Phil's next step is to marry. Roger has been ditched by Joan as her carer. He, Bob and Georgie are hired as children's entertainers for a seven-year-old's birthday party, which goes badly. While out jogging, Dugdale astonishes Sandra by proposing to her, which she accepts. The Lemming Family is becoming increasingly popular and has won a literary award, which is affecting all the family as well as Bob and Queenie, who are all thinly disguised as characters in it. Phil calls a meeting to prepare for a showdown with Wendy. When she arrives with her literary agent Terry, she tells Roger that due to her improved financial situation, she no longer needs alimony from him, which he is pleased with. He proposes to her, which she rejects, telling him and his family that she is engaged to Terry. Roger uses Methuselah to tell Georgie that he is attracted to her, but she makes it clear that the feeling is not mutual, before walking away from him.
Episode 6: Doing A Bunk: 6 September
Removal men are busy at Phil's house after its sale to Jack Dugdale. Dugdale is now engaged to Edith's daughter, Sandra, and the two prospective grooms discuss their respective plans. Georgie, an art student, has started making a video about Roger and his fixation on his crocodile puppet Methuselah, but decides she cannot make a successful project of it, so Roger suggests she make a video of Phil and Edith's wedding instead. Roger tells Edith he will miss her and her biscuits, and that he is in love with Georgie. Bob interrupts the wedding to say that Edith should be with him. The wedding continues despite the interruption, after which the newlywed couple travel by motorhome to Portugal, where a Portuguese-speaking woman recognises them as characters in The Lemming Family.

Solaire of Astora

Solaire of Astora is a knight from the 2011 action role-playing game "Dark Souls". He has received a great deal of popularity amongst fans for his unusually friendly and helpful demeanor, as well as his signature gesture "Praise the Sun", which involves holding up both arms up in a Y-shape with palms facing outward. He is voiced by Daniel Flynn.
Characteristics.
Like the player character, Solaire is an Undead who journeys to the land of Lordran from his homeland of Astora, albeit on a personal mission to "find his very own Sun". His world and the player's come into contact at various times during the game, and he gives the player a White Soapstone item during his first meeting so that the player can be summoned into other worlds as phantoms and "engage in jolly cooperation". He also offers to provide assistance for various bosses during the course of the game. His "summon sign" glows gold rather than the typical white, and he rewards the player with "Sunlight Medals" for a successful co-op fight, due to his membership in the covenant called the Warriors of Sunlight. The player may join the covenant upon meeting certain requirements, after which they can be summoned by a wider range of players, and gain the "Praise the Sun" gesture and "Lightning Spear" miracles.
Solaire is described as a skilled warrior who does not rely on any special powers to win beyond his signature miracles. His armor and shield are decorated with a hand-painted sun, reflecting his worship of the Sun, and by association, Lord Gwyn. While he was theorized by some fans to be Gwyn's firstborn son in disguise, this was later proven not to be the case in "Dark Souls III". He uses a longsword called the Sunlight Straight Sword, which is described as a "featureless long sword contain[ing] the very power of the sun", as well as being "well-forged, and [kept] in good repair [...] but unlikely to live up to its grandiose name". The sword reappears in "Dark Souls II" as the Sun Sword, and in "Dark Souls III" under its original name, where it does have the special power to boost the attack of allies. His armor and shield are also obtainable in "Dark Souls III" by trading various items.
The player typically last encounters Solaire in Lost Izalith, where he has gone insane and hostile upon donning a Sunlight Maggot, which he considers to be his "Sun". However, if the player opens a shortcut and kills the Maggot beforehand, Solaire retains his sanity and can be summoned for the final boss.
Development.
The "Praise the Sun" gesture was conceived prior to the character of Solaire, and was a rare holy gesture used in "Demon's Souls" upon casting a miracle while wearing the "Ring of Sincere Prayer". The game's director, Hidetaka Miyazaki, secretly left the gesture in the game, despite being told by the game's publisher that the pose was not "cool enough" upon physically demonstrating it. From then on, the pose gained personal significance to him, and he was determined to also include it in "Dark Souls". Miyazaki created the character of Solaire in order to bring recognition to the gesture and make it more popular, purposely positioning him as a "champion" who is the first truly helpful NPC that most players see in the game.
He is also Miyazaki's favorite character, with Miyazaki going as far as to design the Sun emblem that appears on Solaire's armor.
Miyazaki has stated that Solaire being taken over by the Sunlight Maggot was intended as "the general norm", but if Solaire is kept alive and fights alongside the player for the last boss, it is the "happiest ending", as he links the flame in his own world and dies by "becoming the Sun".
Merchandise.
On the March 8 Nintendo Direct, Nintendo announced a Solaire Amiibo that would be compatible with "Dark Souls Remastered". The Amiibo, featuring Solaire in a "Praise the Sun" pose, would cause the player's character to perform the gesture from the start of the game when tapped, without any prerequisites. However, the Amiibo was exclusive to GameStop, causing heavy shortages in availability and making it rarer than usual.
Reception.
Destructoid named Knight Solaire one of their favorite new video game characters of 2011, calling him "the embodiment of selfless camaraderie and generosity", as well as "bat-shit crazy". He was also called a "total badass" by Eurogamer. The mission to save Solaire was called one of the 20 most unique sidequests in video game history by GamesRadar+, saying that "if there ever was an NPC worth saving, it would be him".
Solaire was modded into "Darkest Dungeon" as a playable character by a fan of the game, which was called a "fantastic mixup" of the two games by PC Gamer. He also was given Easter eggs in "Borderlands 2" as the similarly named "Knight Solitaire", and in "" as a follower named "Soulaire of Andorhal". A "Praise the Sun"-inspired gesture was included as an emote in "Destiny" called "Praise the Gun".

David Ames (colonel)

David Ames (colonel) (February 2, 1760 - August 6, 1847) served as first superintendent of the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Massachusetts from 1794 to October 31, 1802. He supplied the American army with shovels and guns during the American Revolution and was commissioned in the militia. Upon completion of service at the Armory, he entered the paper-manufacturing business and by 1838 was proprietor of the most extensive paper manufacturing operation in the United States.
Family.
David Ames was born to John Ames (captain) (April 7, 1738 - June 17, 1805) and Susanna (Howard) Ames (May 14, 1759 - January 11, 1821), both of Bridgewater, Massachusetts. His father was a prominent blacksmith who manufactured shovels and guns both prior to and during the American Revolution. His younger brother, Oliver Ames Sr. (April 11, 1779 - September 11, 1863), founded the Oliver Ames Shovel Company of North Easton, Massachusetts in 1803. Other siblings include Susannah (Fobes), Keziah (Packard), Huldah (Willis), Abigail (Lazell), Cynthia and John. Susannah had triplet siblings, both died in infancy.
Early life.
At fifteen years old, David held a commission in the local militia during the American Revolution. Having apprenticed under iron worker and gunsmith Hugh Orr of Bridgewater, Massachusetts he gained knowledge of colonial artillery and supplied guns and shovels valuable to the war effort.
Records show that he and Oliver assisted their father in shovel sales outside Bridgewater. In 1796, Oliver delivered 15 dozen shovels to David, who was to sell them for at least eight dollars per dozen in Hartford, Connecticut.
Business.
Springfield Armory.
The Springfield Armory provided the American Armed Forces with weapons and state-of-the-art weapons engineering for nearly two hundred years. George Washington appointed David to Superintendent of the newly created Armory in 1794. He resigned on October 31, 1802.
Paper Manufacturing.
In 1802, David bought a mill on the bank of the Mill River (Northampton, Massachusetts) in Springfield, MA. He tore down the original mill and erected a new one that would last for 75 years. Sons David Jr. and John went on to become successful in the paper manufacturing business under the name D. &amp; J. Ames Paper. The Ames family established mills in Suffield, Connecticut, Northampton, South Hadley Falls and Chicopee Falls. John obtained the Ames Cylinder Paper-Making Machine patent on May 14, 1822. The patent documentation on sheepskin was signed by President Andrew Jackson. It revolutionized the process by which a constantly moving cylinder was covered in mesh and, half submerged in the vat of pulp, produced a continuous sheet of paper material. It enabled one man to do the work of thirty. On May 18, 1917, the Connecticut Valley Historical Society commemorated the Ames achievement as first paper manufacturers in the Connecticut Valley. Four generations of descendants were in attendance for the unveiling of a tablet, located at the corner of Maple St. and Mill St. in Springfield, Massachusetts.
Personal.
David married Rebecca Johnson (December 26, 1758 - June 29, 1834), daughter of Major Isaac and Mary (Willis) Johnson of Bridgewater, MA, on November 15, 1781. They had nine children:

Portrait of Mrs. Bodolphe

Portrait of Mrs. Bodolphe is a painting by the Dutch Golden Age painter Frans Hals, painted in 1643 as half of a pair of pendant marriage portraits and is still together with its pendant in the Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut.
Painting.
The painting is one of several portrait paintings of wealthy women of Haarlem that Hals made as female halves of marriage pendants, but this one seems to be executed for a second marriage or perhaps 50th wedding anniversary, considering the age of 72 of the sitter. The sitter herself remains unknown, though it and its pendant have been traditionally called "Bodolphe".
Provenance.
In his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works Hofstede de Groot wrote: "158. MADAME BODOLPHE. B. 56 ; M. 106. Three-quarter- length, life size. An old woman sits in a carved chair, seen in full face, and looking at the spectator. She leans her left hand on the arm of her chair and holds her gloves in her right hand. She wears a dark dress trimmed with fur, a white ruff, and a close-fitting white linen cap. 
[Pendant to 157.] Signed on the left with the monogram, and inscribed, "AETAT SVAE 72 AN 1643 " ; canvas, 48 inches by 38 1/2 inches. 
Exhibited by the London dealers T. Agnew and Sons, November and December 1906. 
Exhibited at the Hudson-Fulton Celebration, Metropolitan Museum, New 
York, 1909, No. 34. 
Sale. Odier, Paris, March 25, 1861. 
In the collection of Count Andre Mniszech, Paris. 
In the collection of J. Pierpont Morgan ; exhibited on loan in the Metropolitan Museum, New York."
This painting came into the collection via the bequest of school alumnus Stephen Carlton Clark in 1961. It was selected in 1939 along with "Portrait of a Man with a Beer Jug" by the New York art historian Thomas Craven to contrast Hals' earlier, more colorful genre work with his more subdued later portraits. Recently research into the costumes of Haarlemmers in the 17th-century has revealed that portraits with small wrist collars like hers, or indeed lacking them as her husband does, may indicate the Mennonite faith. This clue narrows the field for an eventual identification.

Lion-class destroyer

The "Lion" class were a planned series of destroyers ("contre-torpilleur") for the French Navy ("Marine Nationale"). The class of two ships were to be a continuation of the project which began in 1913 but were not built due to the outbreak of World War I. While approved by the Naval Ministry for construction, funding for the design was rejected by the French Parliament in 1920.
While never built, the two ships of the class were to be named Lion and Guépard. The names were later reused later by two ships of the .
Design and development.
Beginning with the 30 March 1912 promulgation of the "Statut Naval" (Naval Law), France began developing new doctrines and designs for their destroyer fleet. The Naval Law stipulated that France should build fifty-eight new flotilla craft, for a total of one-hundred fifteen "torpilleur d'escadre" (fleet torpedo boats) by the year 1920. This initially led to the order of two M89-class destroyers originally planned for 1915 but neither would be laid down to the start of World War I. In the interim France ordered twelve from the Empire of Japan, and seized four nearly completed destroyers under construction in France. These seized ships became the and were originally ordered for the Argentine Navy. While construction of the M89 class never proceeded, work on the project continued into the immediate interwar period.
Work on the "torpilleur d'escadre" project had already resumed in 1917 but, by the end of the war, revisions had become necessary. Advances in military technology and the development of new fleet doctrines meant the original project for a single 1500-class of multi-role "fleet torpedo boat" was to be split into two new, separate roles. These were the previous "torpilleur d'escadre", and a new role, "torpilleur-éclaireur" (torpedo scout). The primary role of this new class was to act as scouts for the fleet. The secondary role of the new, larger vessel was defending against attacks by enemy torpedo boats on the French line of battle. Attacking the enemy line of battle themselves, was a distant tertiary objective.
This shift in doctrine began in 1919, when Chief of the Naval General Staff, admiral Ferdinand-Jean-Jacques de Bon () pointed out to Georges Leygues, the Minister of Marine, that between 1914–1918, the Italian had completed or laid down twelve flotilla leaders, compared to the French Navy, which had only built three during the four years of war. Italy, although allies to France during the Great War, was also seen as a growing rival to the Third Republic in the Mediterranean Sea. Flotilla Leaders were a type of destroyer that were larger and more heavily armed than normal destroyers and torpedo boats. These ships were designed to act as flagships for destroyer squadrons and to be able to defeat other destroyers. For the first time, using the English term, "destroyer", Admiral de Bon suggested than rebuilding of France's flotilla ship force should be the Marine Nationale's highest priority, followed by light cruisers and lastly capital ships. The flotilla craft force would be made up of the "torpilleur d'escadre", and the new "torpilleur-éclaireur". Minister Leygues agreed and accepted the suggestions of 4 March 1919.
The new design for the "torpedo scout", was based heavily on advancements in naval warfare developed during the First World War. Using intelligence on Allied shipbuilding plans, the "Naval Constructors Department" ("Service technique des constructions navales", STCN) were influenced by the 2,000-tonne Italian and the 1,625-tonne Royal Navy . The design was also influenced by the former Imperial German Navy "S113" a large torpedo boat ("Großes Torpedoboot") which was taken by France after the Treaty of Versailles as reparations from Germany and recommissioned as "Amiral Sénès". The German 'torpedo boat' (really a large destroyer) was even larger than the "Leone"s, displacing 2,060 tonnes and armed with four 150 mm guns. The new design requirements called for a robust hull, with improved seakeeping abilities and speed. Newly developed Modèle 1919D torpedoes were chosen over the older Modèle 1912D torpedoes originally planned for the M89 design. The original "torpilleur d'escadre" was planned to be armed with /25 guns to be built by Schneider-Creusot. The problem was that now, their short barrel length made them unsuitable for the increased expected ranges destroyers were expected to fight at (). In response to the new threat of air attack from airplanes, the new ships were to be armed with high-angle /50 anti-aircraft guns. The new "torpedo scout" was also now to be armed with depth charges for use against another new weapon of war, submarines. Improved construction techniques were also requested. The new ships would be built with three compartments for damage control purposes, and each compartment would have a dedicated bilge pump. As design work continued the nomenclature continued to evolve. With greater emphasis on destroying enemy torpedo boats continued, the 'torpilleur-éclaireur' role continued to evolve and over time led to the revival of an older designation that had fallen out of usage since the 300-ton , the 'contre-torpilleur' ("counter-torpedo boat"), a large multi-role destroyer capable of scouting and combat.
Cancellation.
With these new technical requirements the Superior Naval Council ()) proposed a final design for the Marine Nationales new generation of flotilla craft. A new "torpilleur d'escadre" and a new "contre-torpilleur" design were approved 28 April 1920 by the new incoming Minister of Marine, Adolphe Landry. Two "contre-torpilleur"s of the new design were accepted by the Ministry of Marine for the next naval estimates (naval budget) and were to be named "Lion" and "Guépard". Both designs though suffered from the same issue, the main armament. The original requirements from the STCN called for guns. These guns would have a longer range than the M89s guns (which were never built). The choice of a gun would give French destroyers a heavier calibre than the contemporary British 120 mm/40 naval gun and the Italian 120 mm/45 naval gun. Instead the CSM "contre-torpilleur" design was armed with five single mounted Canon de 100 mm Modèle 1917 which were the most modern French destroyer guns available at the time. The STCN reluctantly accepted the design for the two destroyers in order to expedite construction. The "Lion"-class destroyers were to act essentially as prototypes for future French destroyers and her successors were expected to be armed with larger calibre guns. Concerns about the small calibre main armament of the destroyers continued to dog the project even after acceptance by the STCN. The French Parliament which shared similar concerns, eventually rejected funding for the two ships. Work on the destroyer project continued after this set back. On 14 January 1921 work began on designing a larger, more heavily armed "contre-torpilleur" based on the "Lion" class which eventually became the . Work on the "torpilleur d'escadre" program became the and was initially also to be armed with four of the same 100 mm guns as the "Lion" class. Both of these destroyer programmes were eventually armed with the recently developed Canon de 130 mm Modèle 1919.

Heraldic badges of the Royal Air Force

Heraldic badges of the Royal Air Force are the insignia of certain commands, squadrons, units, wings, groups, branches and stations within the Royal Air Force. They are also commonly known as crests, especially by serving members of the Royal Air Force, but officially they are badges. Each badge must be approved by the reigning monarch of the time, and as such will either have a King's or Queen's Crown upon the top of the badge, dependent upon which monarch granted approval and the disbandment date of the unit. The approval process involves a member of the College of Arms (the Inspector of RAF Badges) who acts as an advisory on all matters pertaining to the design and suitability of the insignia and motto.
Some badges that have been approved by either King Edward VIII or George VI will have simply adopted the Queen's Crown after her accession in 1952. The number of badges that King Edward VIII signed is limited due to his short time on the throne.
History.
The first badge adopted by the RAF was the official Royal Air Force Badge, and was instituted on 1 August 1918, some four months after the formation of the Royal Air Force. Afterwards, units and squadrons adopted their own insignia and used them in a way similar to a regimental colour. For some squadrons, their unofficial badges would pre-date the formation of the RAF. Most Royal Flying Corps squadrons during the First World War would paint their squadron emblem (or device) upon a shield to hang up in the mess or squadron bar. They often viewed themselves as 'knights of the air' and the badge helped foster a sense of identity on and with the squadron.
In the case of 100 Squadron, their badge incorporated a skull and crossbones insignia that had been liberated from a French "house of ill-repute" in 1918. Some mascots were back formations from the badge rather than supplying the idea for the badge. No. 234 Squadron had "..a dragon rampant, with flames issuing from the mouth.." approved by King George VI in August 1940. By 1956, the squadron were at RAF Geilenkirchen in Germany and were looking for a suitable mascot for their squadron based on its dragon insignia; they reportedly would settle for an iguana.
Until the early 1930s, squadrons and units would use their own informal badges and insignia. In 1935, the process of formalising the badges was undertaken whereby an official heraldic approval would be granted by the ruling monarch of the time. The whole design process would ultimately rest with the Chester Herald as the Inspector of RAF Badges. This has changed over the years and has been filled by Clarenceux King of Arms and by the Surrey Herald of Arms Extraordinary. The Inspector of RAF Badges would liaise with squadrons and units to finalise designs that would reflect already adopted insignia or to utilise something suitable to recognise the squadron or unit. An Air Ministry Order (A.8/1936) was issued in January 1936 and detailed the criteria for badges and their ultimate approval via the Chester Herald and the king. In June of the same year, King Edward VIII approved the first raft of badges for numbers 4, 15, 18, 19, 22, 33, 201, 207, 216 and 604 Squadrons.
When a new badge is granted an approval by the reigning monarch, the unit or squadron is presented with the original goatskin painting signed by the monarch and copies will be made and drawn to the standard set by the original. The Inspector of RAF badges keeps copies which are registered in large albums known as "The inspectors ordinary copies". A badge is 'ensigned' on the top with either a King's or a Queen's Crown; this depends on which particular monarch was ruling at the time. For Edward VIII and George VI, a King's (or Tudor Crown) is used. The number of badges approved by Edward VIII are small in number; the period between his accession to the throne and his abdication lasted only eleven months. As the first batch of badges for the approvals process was completed in July 1936, most badges were approved by his two successors (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II). The granting of a badge is a personal honour between the monarch and unit that has been awarded the badge, and is not conferred upon the RAF as a whole.
Any serving unit could apply for a badge and some did, whereas others did not or had their application thwarted by time; in the case of No. 273 Squadron, their badge was still awaiting final approval after several re-submissions when it had been rejected by Air Command South-East Asia and by the Inspector of Badges. This hinged upon the proposed use of an Asian Fylfot, which strongly resembles a Swastika. The squadron was disbanded in 1945 before being issued a badge due to uncertainty on a design or motto. A campaign in 1996 to have the badge issued for the veterans of No. 273 Squadron was unsuccessful despite the backing of several MP's, and it was finally awarded to the squadron association in principle. If a unit could not adhere to the qualifying heraldic criteria, then a badge would not be issued. Where badges had not been issued or even applied for, a badge of a higher authority could be used instead (RAF Cowden in East Yorkshire used the Strike Command badge as it was an air weapons range, RAF Bridgnorth used the badge of No. 7 School of Recruit Training as that was the station's reason for existence). The rules regarding badges were changed over the years and since 1992, public funds could be used to pay for the badge design where previously money had to be raised by the squadron or unit to pay for the process. Additionally, a unit must have been in existence for five years (and expect to be in existence for another five years) and also have a personnel strength of more than 75.
Under certain circumstances, badges from defunct units have been resurrected when new units or wings have been formed, but squadron badges are not usually reassigned as normally the squadron just assumes an old number and accepts that badge and motto. When the Force Generation Wing (FGW) from No. 90 Signals Unit at RAF Leeming was re-formed as the Operational Information Services Wing (OISW), it was approved for a close copy version of the former No. 60 Group (Signals) badge; the only difference being the name of the unit was changed, and the indentations where the unit number used to be on the main badge, were removed.
Approval and design of badges extends to all units associated with the Royal Air Force; Regular, Reserve, Auxiliary and Air Training Corps.
Over 800 squadron and unit badges, carved from Welsh slate, are set into the floor of the central church of the Royal Air Force, St Clements Danes, London. The first carved badge was placed in the floor by its carver, Madge Whiteman, in 1958. Whiteman would go on to carve at least 80 more and the intention at the time was for there to eventually be 1,000 badges set into the floor. In 1996, the RAF Heraldry Trust was set up to paint every badge issued to either Royal Air Force or Commonwealth Air Forces where an approved badge was issued. A vast replica selection of RAF badges adorn the walls of the RAF Club in London.
Design.
The badge itself consists of five distinct parts; 
RAF Badges are often called 'crests', even by serving members of the military, but they are in fact, heraldic badges. Crests is a common misnomer and represents just one part of a badge in heraldic terms. A crest is usually atop a coat of arms, and not RAF badges as they ensigned by a crown. In true heraldry, a coat of arms (or badge) can have a crest or not, but a crest cannot exist on its own. One exception to this is No. 600 Squadron, which has two badges, the first was the traditional badge with a sword in front of a crescent moon which reflected the squadron's night-time activities. The second badge, also known affectionately by the squadron as "The Dust-Cart Crest", was the badge of the City of London Arms. As this had the appearance of the RAF eagle at the top and not the crown, this could be interpreted as a crest.
One of the few squadrons to not have a scroll is No. 607 Squadron as it does not have a motto. Many mottoes were suggested for 607 Squadron, which have been described as being from "suitable to the ribald."
Squadrons and stations.
Flying squadrons were additionally expected to display their badge (or the main insignia/blazon from it) on their aircraft. This was also to be enhanced by the addition of a white shape behind the badge or insignia that would aid in seeing the badge and the particular shape would denote the role of the squadron; either a fighter, bomber or reconnaissance squadron, though some doubled up on their role. Non-flying units would display their badge on a sign either at the entrance to the base or outside the station headquarters.
One of the first squadrons to be awarded their badge was No. 18 Squadron, who had a winged white pegasus as their insignia which dated back to the First World War. When the badge was approved in 1936, the pegasus had been redrawn with a more upright rearing stance and was now painted in gules (which is the colour red in heraldry). No. 208 Squadron had been in Egypt for 17 years when they asked for approval for their squadron badge. Due to their motto of "Vigilant" and the nature of their work (observation), they had been using the Eye of Horus as their squadron insignia. The Chester Herald informed the squadron that the use of an eye was considered unlucky in English Heraldry, so the squadron adopted the Giza Sphinx as their insignia instead. The badge was approved by King George VI in October 1937. Another squadron with associations in Egypt was No. 45 Squadron, who had a winged camel on their badge. This represented the fact the squadron was equipped with Sopwith Camel aircraft in the First World War and its association with the Middle-East in the Second World War.
The badge of No. 22 Squadron has a red disc (torteaux) with a Maltese Cross and the symbol for pi. This is because when No. 7 Squadron and 22 Sqn were stationed together during the First World War, 22 Sqn would take off directly over the 7 Sqn Lines (accommodation) and the fraction 22/7 approximates to pi. No. 81 Squadron badge has a red star (mullet) of Russia as its insignia. The Russians awarded the squadron the star when they took Hawker Hurricanes out to Murmansk to train the Soviet crews during the Second World War.
Squadrons would often use insignia reflecting where they had served, RAF stations would more often than not use a local landmark or item particular to that area. RAF St Eval had a church in the middle of their badge (St Uvelus) which, when the airfield was being built, was under threat of demolition. It survived and became a repository for remembrance of fallen comrades. It also acted as a sign to crews that they were nearly home. RAF Scampton's badge has a bow and arrow insignia. This represented the airfield (the arrow) and the moving of the A15 (the bow) so that the runway could be extended to which necessitated the bow formation of the road at the eastern end of the airfield. The station badge for RAF Waddington consists of a small part of Lincoln Cathedral, again a focussing point for crews returning from active missions. The badge was not approved until 1954 by Elizabeth II.
Other stations had badges designed to reflect their role. In 1957, RAF Marham was awarded their new badge which depicted a blue bull as its insignia and the motto of "Deter". The motto indicated their base's new role in the nuclear deterrent role and the bull symbolised that deterrence. The colour blue is thought to have a been a nod towards the Blue Danube, the RAF's first atomic bomb.
Mottoes.
Mottoes convey the spirit of the unit or squadron; for commands and training stations, this was usually about what the intended output of that particular role was. Both Bomber and Fighter Commands had badges where the blazon and motto reflected that role. Bomber Command's motto was "Strike hard, strike sure", whilst Fighter command had the motto of "Offence defence". Elements of both blazons and mottoes were included in the Strike Command badge that superseded both Bomber and Fighter Command when they were combined as Strike Command in 1968. No. 617 Squadron's motto is "Après moi le déluge" which translates from the French as "After me, the flood". This reflected the reason that the squadron was created; to bomb the dams in the Ruhr Valley. King George VI approved the badge for 617 Squadron in March 1944, some ten months after the Dambusters Raid. Most mottoes are written in Latin or English, though other languages were used; 
No. 100 Squadron had their badge awarded in 1938 whilst posted to RAF Seletar and opted to have the motto ("Sarang tebuan jengan dijolok"; "Never stir up a hornets nest") written in Malaysian. The squadron blazon was traditionally a skull and crossbones (which it retains on its badge) with the motto "Blood and Bones". While the squadron was posted to RNAS Donibristle in Fife, they replaced the skull and crossbones motif with a bulldog and the motto "Nemo me impune lacessit", ("No-one provokes me with impunity"), but reverted to the old motif and motto soon afterwards.
Other badges were also approved for locational reasons; No. 240 Squadron had a badge adorned with a Viking helmet and the motto of "Sjo vordur lopt vordur" which is Icelandic for "Guardian of the sea and air". Badges were also approved for the squadrons in the non-UK range (IE squadrons in the 300–399 and 400–499 ranges - the Article XV squadrons) such as No. 330 Squadron who had a Viking Longship and the motto of "Trygg havet", which was in Norwegian, appropriately enough, (as it was a Norwegian Squadron) meaning "Guarding the seas." The badges approved to Dominion (or Commonwealth) crews would traditionally incorporate insignia with a connection to the homeland to which the crews flying the aircraft belonged to. No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron had their badge approved in August 1941 with a Bateleur eagle and the motto of "Hlabezulu" which derives from Shona meaning "The stabber of the sky." Badges were issued to non-flying units such as the Iraq Levies, who had a badge approved by King George VI in 1949 that had two crossed Khanjar as its insignia and the motto of "Ready."
Heraldic terminology.
The component elements of badges are described – with regard to stances, positions, actions, attitudes and tinctures (colours) – by the use of heraldic blazon. The most common terms used are listed below. For example, No. 102 Squadron badge (shown on the right) is described as "On a demi-terrestrial globe azure &amp; dark blue a lion rampant guardant gules holding in the forepaws a bomb sable".

Eloise Bibb Thompson

Eloise Bibb Thompson (June 26, 1878 – January 8, 1928) was an American educator, playwright, poet, and journalist. She married fellow journalist and activist Noah D. Thompson.
Early life.
Eloise Alberta Veronica Bibb was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the daughter of Catherine Adele Brian Bibb and Charles H. Bibb. Her father was a federal customs inspector. She trained as a teacher at New Orleans University, then attended Oberlin Academy from 1899 to 1901. She graduated from Howard University in 1907. She pursued further studies throughout her life, at Columbia University, University of Southern California, and New York University.
Career.
Eloise Bibb taught school in New Orleans as a young woman. Bibb's first book of 26 poems was published in Boston in 1895. From 1908 to 1911 she worked as head resident at the Social Settlement House affiliated with Howard University. Howard University president Wilbur P. Thirkield said, "She is a woman who has accomplished a hard task of colored settlement work by putting her heart in it and her life under it and wrought wonderful results."
She moved to Los Angeles, California with her new husband in 1911, and wrote for various publications there, including the "Los Angeles Tribune", "Morning Sun" "Out West", and "Tidings" (published by the Diocese of Los Angeles). She was also active in the Catholic Women's Clubs of Los Angeles. The Thompsons were considered members of the "Ink Slingers" literary circle in Los Angeles.
Eloise Bibb Thompson's "A Reply to the Clansman" (1915) was a screenplay in response to the film "The Birth of a Nation". She wrote at least four plays: "A Friend of Democracy" (1920), "Caught" (1920), "Africanus" (1922, about the life of Marcus Garvey; it was directed by Olga Grey), and "Cooped Up" (1924), and she was associated with the National Ethiopian Art Theatre in New York.

Waukesha Beach Railway

The Waukesha Beach Railway operated from 1895 until 1949 as an interurban railway from Waukesha to Pewaukee Lake in Wisconsin.
History and infrastructure.
The Waukesha Beach Railway was formed on August 27, 1894, with $75,000 in capital. The railway was built by C. E. Loss &amp; Company of Chicago. The first summer resort season on the railway opened on June 15, 1895, while the railway was formally opened on June 25, 1895.
Waukesha is situated west of Milwaukee and has become of national reputation on account of its mineral springs at the end of the 19th century, and developed to one of the best-known resorts of wealthy people from Chicago and Milwaukee. Aside from its spring water and the beauties of the town, Waukesha has had, originally, no attractions to make it popular as a resort.
The new rail road, which was long, brought it within easy reach of Pewaukee Lake, a beautiful sheet of water about six miles long and a mile and a half wide. The railway was intended simply for summer pleasure travel to the lake and was planned to be shut down in winter. The railway line connected the terminus at the North-western Railroad depot in Waukesha with the beach of the lake. The railway company carried out extensive improvements at the beach, which it owned, and it became a beautiful spot. The improvements included the Palm Gardens ballroom, a hotel, 3 roller coasters, a fun house and many other amusement rides. Well known entertainers such as Ted Mack, The Andrews Sisters and Heine &amp; His Grenadiers were featured at the park. In 1897, a baseball diamond was added, where a Milwaukee team, managed by the legendary Connie Mack, played an exhibition game.
The railway bought and fenced-off its entire right of way. The construction was much the same as that of a good, solid, steam road, except that the grades were heavier and some of the curves sharper than would be called good practice unless in a mountainous country. The rails were standard 60-pound T rolled by the Illinois Steel Company. An abundance of gravel ballast was obtained along the route, and the contractors have put in a very solid roadbed over which trains ran as smoothly as if on the best steam trunk lines. The time usually taken between one terminus and another was about 15 minutes. The schedule, including switching at terminals, was a round trip every 40 minutes. A trip has been made in 12 minutes. Usually there were no stops between terminals.
The profile of the road was furnished out by William Powrie, the engineer. From Waukesha a climb was made of 140 feet in the first three miles and a descent of about 90 feet in the last three. The heaviest grade was 3.2 per cent. The deepest cut and the greatest fill were each. Outside of the city limits of Waukesha there were no curves of more than 6 degrees, and when not too heavily loaded or when running down grade the cars made 40 miles an hour around them. At the crossing of the Fox River in Waukesha a plate girder bridge 50 feet long was erected. At the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad crossing interlocking home and distant semaphore signals were put in so that trains on neither road stop unless compelled to by the signals.
Rolling stock.
Two trains were kept in operation. The rolling stock consisted initially of three motor cars and four trailers. All were open except one motor car which was closed. They were all over all and the open cars had twelve seats. They were Pullman built mounted on Brill maximum traction trucks. The motor equipment consisted of two 50-horse-power Walker motors to each car. The Walker company has been devoting special attention to motors of this class for interurban service, and the results in this case were very satisfactory.
The original two-motor cars were replaced with four-motor 100 type cars in 1903. Year-around service began to West Limits on 11 December 1899.
Power plant.
The power plant contained a 250-horse-power Allis Corliss steam engine and a 150-kilowatt Walker generator and switchboard apparatus. The trolley line was divided into three sections, each fed separately.
Management.
Alfred M. Jones, who was well known under the familiar name of "Long Jones," was the first president. The operation of the road was initially under the charge of C. L. Jones, formerly of the Milwaukee Street Railway. The railway was bought by The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company in August 1897 for $62,500.
Decline and closure.
By the late 1930s, financial problems and increased auto ownership led to the final abandonment of operations to the park on July 21, 1941. The interurban totally ceased operations on July 2, 1951. After World War II, Waukesha Beach became less of an attraction &amp; the entire park closed in 1949. Today, the original 20 acres used for the amusement park are known as "Beach Park", a subdivision of homes.

Food security in Mexico

Mexico has sought to ensure food security through its history. Yet, despite various efforts, Mexico continues to lack national food and nutrition strategies that secure food security for the people. Food security is defined as "when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life" by the World Food Summit in 1996. As a large country of more than 100 million people, planning and executing social policies are complex tasks. Although Mexico has been expanding its food and nutrition programs that have been expected, and to some degree, have contributed to increases in health and nutrition, food security, particularly as it relates to obesity and malnutrition, still remains a relevant public health problem.
Introduction.
The multifaceted nature of food security includes the combination of four elements:
 Food availability: Food availability refers to the adequate supply of quality food, provided through domestic production, imports, and aid.
 Food access: Food access refers to how easily the adequate supply of quality food can be accessed.
 Food stability: Food stability refers to both the availability and access dimensions of food security. A household or individual, to be food secure, must have access to adequate food at all times and should not risk access to food as a result of sudden crises or cyclical events like seasonal food insecurity.
Food insecurity is a situation of limited or uncertain availability or ability to acquire safe and nutritious foods. It has been associated with negative impacts on human development such as increased poverty and inequality and with adverse health outcomes such as increased risk of being obese. Food insecurity has also been correlated with poor economic growth.
In Mexico, differences in parts of the country are caused by factors such as socioeconomic status and urban/rural residence. The North region is the most industrialized, has a high per capital income and infrastructure, and has sufficient access to basic services. Although less developed than the North, the Central region still consists of large developed cities like Guadalajara. The South region is the least developed, has the most rural and indigenous inhabitants in Mexico, and has insufficient access to basic services. Therefore, health issues like infectious diseases and undernutrition are especially prevalent.
History.
Starting in the 1980s, various economic reforms changed productive sectors in Latin America. The Mexican agricultural sector, in particular, was affected when the state of Mexico began advocating for an export policy. The Mexican government undertook more radical attempts to restructure policy to further involve the agricultural sector into the global market such as joining the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
Furthermore, as a result of the 2008 global financial crisis, Mexico's economic activity declined. Mexico’s gross domestic product (GDP) fell sharply, and its economy shrank by 6-7% in 2009. Its food poverty rate increased rapidly, from 13.8% in 2006 to 18.2% in 2010, reversing the declining trend of food poverty since 1996. With the increase in food prices and decline in income, food security increased, and the social impact of the financial crisis had a larger effect among the poorest and most vulnerable groups.
As Mexico moves towards more open markets in agricultural trade, land, and water with NAFTA and the reprivatization of land, it faces an unknown economic future.
Food availability.
The supply of available food energy in Mexico goes beyond the requirements, but a great number of people still suffer from food insecurities. Moreover, the probability of being food insecure has been reported to decrease with increasing income. Amartya Sen argues that ownership of food is one of the most primitive property rights. However, even when food supplies are sufficient, there can be food insecurity.
Between 2003 and 2005, the total Mexican food supply was sufficient, averaging 3,270 kilocalories per daily capita, higher than the minimum requirements of 1,850 kilocalories per daily capita. The National Survey of Wholesale, Food and Nutritional Status in Rural Areas (ENAAEN) data gathered in 2008 for 90 rural areas found that more than 90% of localities in these areas sold foods such as dry beans, chick peas, dairy and meat, 86.7% sold vegetables, and 78.9% sold fruit. This data results in the conclusion that food availability is not the problem; rather, the issue of food insecurity is caused by an interplay of other factors.
Furthermore, more than 18% of the Mexican population in 2008 was in food poverty with Chiapas, Guerrero, and Oaxaca being the states with the most severe food poverty, according to a CONEVAL analysis. The vulnerability and dependence on food price increases is higher for the lower income deciles. 
According to Mexico's National Public Health Institute, few households meet what the guidelines for an adequate and diverse diet For indigenous populations, the problem is worse. Only 10% of the non-indigenous rural population and 3% of the rural indigenous population consume meat three or more days per week, pointing to the prevalence of anemia in the population.
Dietary concerns.
In 2013, Mexico was ranked fourth globally and first in Latin America in per capita spending on ultra-processed foods and drinks.
Factors of food insecurity.
Malnutrition.
Adequate nutrition and food are fundamental for human survival, health, and growth. Malnutrition contributes to maternal and infant mortality and morbidity and diminishes development. Childhood malnutrition could be pointed to as a consequence of inequity in the distribution of resources, services, wealth, and opportunities.
In Mexico, although the prevalence of malnutrition has been decreasing, it continues to be a health issue where policies aimed at reducing food poverty have not been effective. 13.5% of children under five still suffer from chronic undernutrition and nearly 35 thousand have lost their lives because of this problem.
Chronic malnutrition is much more prevalent in the south and rural areas than in the north and in urban ones. The indigenous population in Mexico faces a significantly more severe situation. For instance, over 33% of children under five suffer from chronic malnutrition, which trumps the national average.
Obesity.
Mexico has experienced a dramatic increase in wealth in recent decades, bringing a significant shift in socio-economic status and a geographical shift from rural to urban. This transformation has brought about harmful dietary patterns: increased access to low-priced highly energy-dense foods and an increase in sedentary behavior. As a result, Mexico is witnessing a rapidly growing epidemic of obesity and obesity related non-communicable diseases.
The main factors to which the rise in obesity have been attributed to are the increase in the consumption of hyper-caloric foods that are rich in fat, salt, and sugar and poor in important nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber as well as the decrease in physical activity.
The dramatic increase in obesity rates has resulted in higher rates of obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and an increase in related healthcare costs. 32% of men and 26% of women were said to be of normal weight. It is estimated that by 2050, 12% of men and 9% of women will be of normal weight. Economically, this will be a large burden. It is estimated that a 1% reduction in BMI could save 43 million $US in healthcare costs in 2020 and 85 million $US in 2050. Therefore, it is important that measures be taken for the prevention of obesity.
Government efforts.
In 1997, the Mexican government started a new program aimed at relieving extreme poverty in the country. Programa de Educación, Salud, y Alimenación (PROGRESA) was initially implemented for poor households in rural areas, but due to its success, it was expanded to urban areas in 2001. Around 2.6 million families participated by 2000, including a third of all rural families. The program involved a cash reward for families that undertook actions to improve the health and nutritional status of their household. The program was relatively successful: attendance in secondary school increased by more than 20% for girls and 10% for boys in PROGRESA households.
The National Crusade against Hunger (CNCH) started in 2013 and was implemented by the federal government through the Secretariat of Social Development (SEDESOL). Its objective included "massively abolishing poverty, undernutrition, and food deprivation resulting from lack of access to food in Mexico." According to the CONEVAL, the CNCH has reached 7.1 million Mexicans. It includes interventions run by 55 preexisting programs in the fields of health and nutrition services, food production and distribution, and social and educational development, among others. The two participants with the largest budgets in 2013 were the Opportunidades Program and the Ministry of Health. The CNCH campaign started in 400 municipalities with the highest numbers and percentages of people living in conditions of extreme poverty and food insecurity. Its initial three priorities were boosting food supply and provision actions, increasing the number of families with access to money transfers and food supplements, and increasing the capacity of the population for acquiring food.
Some studies report that households receiving cash transfers and enrolled in social health insurance were not protected against food insecurity during the 2008 crisis. However, the program that provided cash grants to the elderly population (i.e. above 70 years old) did protect households against food insecurity.

Robert Whitney Imbrie

Robert Whitney Imbrie was the first United States Foreign Service officer to be assassinated. He was murdered in Tehran, Persia [now Iran] while serving on temporary assignment.
Early years.
Imbrie was born in Washington, D.C. on April 23, 1883. He was the only surviving child of Jeremiah and Leila (Whitney) Imbrie. His mother died when he was seven; his father when he was thirteen. Imbrie then came under the care of his maternal aunt and her husband, Mary O. and Charles Fishbaugh.
Imbrie attended Friends Select School, Central High School, George Washington University, (A.B. 1902; LL.B. 1905) and Yale Law School (LL.M. 1906). The topic of his master’s thesis was admiralty law. In 1907 he was appointed attorney-in-charge of the Seaman’s Branch of the Legal Aid Society in New York City.
In 1908, Imbrie opened a law practice in Baltimore with Howard McCormick, who later served as a long-time professor of English at the United States Naval Academy.
Imbrie traveled extensively between 1906 and 1915, visiting the southwest U.S., Canada, Europe, and Gabon, West Africa. His guide to Africa was Richard Lynch Garner, who had been assigned by William Temple Hornaday, the director of the New York Zoological Society, to bring back a live gorilla, which he did.
Military and diplomatic service.
World War I.
In late 1915 Imbrie enrolled as a volunteer driver in the American Ambulance Field Service, which was part of the Automobile Section of the French Army. He served in France from December 1915 until October, 1916, when he transferred to the Army of the Orient in Macedonia. He served there until April 1917, when the United States entered the war.
Imbrie received the following medals for his wartime service—the Croix de Guerre, the White Rose Croix de Guerre, the Ambulance Medal, the Field Service Medal, and the Medal of Recognition for serving six months or more at the front. He was one of the longest-serving volunteer ambulance drivers in the war, seventeen months.
Russia.
Because of his age and a recent bout with typhus, Imbrie could not enlist in the U.S. military; instead he joined the U.S. Consular Service and was sent to Petrograd. He arrived in November, 1917, in the midst of the Russian Revolution.
With the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk about to be signed, ending the war between Germany and Russia, the American legation moved north in late February, 1918. In April Ambassador David Francis sent Imbrie back to Petrograd, where he stayed for five months as the primary and at times the sole U.S. representative in the city. On August 30, Imbrie learned of his imminent arrest. With the help of the Norwegian embassy, he secured false papers and transportation out of the country.
Finland.
In early 1919, Imbrie, then based in Viborg, Finland, began tracking the movement of the northern division of the White Army as it prepared to seize Petrograd and Moscow from the Bolshevik Red Army. In addition, Imbrie worked to provide food relief to thousands of Russian émigrés. After the fall of the White Army in the north, he left Finland in June 1920. By then he had been tried in absentia by the Bolsheviks and sentenced to death.
Turkey.
Imbrie was next posted to Crimea, where the southern division of the White Army was active; however, when he arrived in Turkey in December, 1920, he found it, too, had collapsed. Instead, he was assigned to Constantinople under Admiral Mark Bristol, who headed the U.S. military and diplomatic missions in Turkey. After traveling extensively throughout the region doing reconnaissance, Imbrie left Turkey in July, 1921.
Returning to Turkey in March, 1922, Imbrie became the only U.S. official observer in Angora (Ankara), the seat of the new government of modern Turkey. There he met Katherine Helene Gillespie (1883–1968), an American relief worker caring for Armenian and Greek orphans of genocide and war. They married on December 26, 1922. Imbrie continued his reconnaissance work, befriended Mustapha Kemal, the new president of Turkey, and tracked American commercial interests in the area. In 1923, after Imbrie learned that a $40,000 bounty had been placed on his head, he and Katherine returned to the United States. On the way they stopped in Switzerland so Imbrie could brief the U.S. representative at the Lausanne Peace Conference regarding oil concessions in Turkey.
Fateful service in Persia.
Posting to Tehran.
Imbrie’s next post was to Tabriz, Persia (Iran); however, before assuming that duty, he was temporarily reassigned to Tehran when Consul Bernard Gotlieb went on leave. Imbrie immediately immersed himself in this new post as Persia struggled with both internal strife, involving politics and religion, and external pressures, including oil interests and foreign entanglements.
Murder.
In early 1924, there had been several outbreaks of anti-Bahai violence in Tehran. On the morning of 18 July, Imbrie went to visit a well in the city's bazaar where it was alleged a man had lost his sight because of a sacrilege but had had it restored when he repented. Imbrie took a camera with him as he often did, his hobby being travel-writing and photography. Accompanying him was Melvin Seymour, an American roustabout, who was serving house arrest at the consulate.
Upon their arriving at the well, someone yelled that they were Bahai; another accused them of having poisoned the well. A crowd quickly gathered and chased Imbrie and Seymour, who managed to escape in their carriage. The mob caught up with them, however, when the carriage was blocked by a motorbike near the Cossack battery. There they were pulled from the carriage and beaten by the crowd. The police eventually intervened and took Imbrie and Seymour to the police hospital. Shortly afterwards, the mob broke into the hospital and again assaulted Imbrie. He died at 3:00 p.m.
Immediately, suspicion that Imbrie's murder was politically motivated fell on Reza Khan. Some of the attackers were members of a regiment of the Persian Cossack Brigade. This brigade had been under the command of Reza Khan, first as commander of the brigade, and then, after the coup, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army.
Imbrie's body was shipped home aboard the , the first U.S. battleship to enter the Persian Gulf, Among the notables attending his funeral services in Washington, D.C. was President Calvin Coolidge. Imbrie and his wife Katherine are buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.
Hours after Imbrie's death, Reza Khan, then prime minister as well as minister of war, declared martial law and used the murder as an excuse to consolidate his power. According to Major Sherman Miles, a United States Army General Staff officer sent to Tehran to investigate, the murder was deliberate. Miles concluded that the anti-Bahai rioting in Tehran was intended by the Iranian government to end in the death of a foreigner. Reza Khan wanted a foreigner to die "so that he could declare martial law and check the power of the Mullahs."
Aftermath.
The U.S. State Department and especially the consulate in Tehran worked to bring the guilty parties to justice. However, when three people were executed (two teenagers and an army private), U.S. officials believed that justice had failed. Meanwhile Imbrie's widow sought what she considered adequate indemnity for her husband's death, a legal battle that lasted for over 25 years. In 1950 the $70,000 indemnity that Persia had paid the United States was folded into a fund to educate foreign students.

"Gloves Off" is the fourth episode of the second season of the AMC television series "Better Call Saul", the spinoff series of "Breaking Bad". The episode aired on March 7, 2016 on AMC in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on Netflix in several countries.
Plot.
Opening.
In a preview of the episode's conclusion, Mike returns home bruised and beaten and tosses a stack of hundred-dollar bills onto his kitchen table. He pulls a bag of frozen vegetables from his freezer, presses it to his face, then slowly sinks into his living room chair.
Main story.
The Davis &amp; Main partners criticize Jimmy for airing his TV ad without their consent. Cliff decides to give him a second chance, though he will be under more scrutiny in the future.
Jimmy leaves Kim an urgent voicemail but Howard and Chuck are already grilling her about not warning them before Jimmy's ad aired. She takes responsibility for not letting them know in advance, claiming that she did not think it was necessary. Howard reprimands her and she promises it will not happen again.
Jimmy prepares to enter Chuck's house but realizes he forgot to remove his electronics, so he grudgingly turns back to Chuck's mailbox and empties his pockets. When Chuck doesn't answer his knock, Jimmy uses his key to enter. He finds Chuck shivering on the couch, still dressed to leave for work but covered by a space blanket. Chuck refuses to go to the hospital, so Jimmy wraps him in a second space blanket, then sits with him all night. The next morning, Jimmy condemns Chuck for allowing Howard to reprimand Kim. Chuck tells Jimmy he causes harm to everyone around him, but cannot admit his own mistakes. Jimmy offers to quit practicing law if Chuck will help Kim, but Chuck refuses.
Nacho and Mike monitor a restaurant and Nacho says he fears retaliation from Tuco if Tuco discovers his secret drug dealing. Nacho tells Mike he and Tuco meet there to settle accounts with their street dealers, so Nacho thinks it is an ideal place to kill Tuco. Mike refuses, saying it would attract retaliation by the Salamancas.
Instead, Mike calls police to the restaurant, then fakes a minor accident between his car and Tuco's in the parking lot. When Tuco comes out to check on his car, Mike goads Tuco into striking him repeatedly just as police arrive. Because Tuco was carrying a gun, he is arrested for assault with a deadly weapon. Nacho later pays Mike but Mike declines to give a reason for going to such trouble to avoid killing Tuco.

Mangalkot (ancient sculpture)

Mangalkot () is an ancient sculpture situated in Shibganj Upazila, Bogra district, Rajshahi Division, Bangladesh, an archaeological site of Bangladesh, as an archaeological establishment Bangladesh Archeology Department.
Location.
Mangalkot situated at Namuja Union in Shibganj Upazila of Bogra district. It is located 1.6 kilometres south or southwest of Mahasthangarh Museum. In fact, it is located in Palibari Mound. The mound was misplaced by a large mound called Chingaspur which was shown in the Chingaspur mouza.
Description.
The Mangalkot mound was plots at 207 plots in Palibari Mausam and its length was , from in height and . Due to insufficient access to landowners or owners, there is considerable damage to the mound. In the year 1974, some people of the locality invented illegal excavation in search of the treasure and discovered some of the most valuable and high-end terracotta pictograms, and with that it suffered substantial damage.
Mangalkot sculpture.
The Department of Archeology at Mangalkot explored more than one thousand artefacts by excavating in 1981–1983. Antiquities are terracotta sculptures of Gupta and Gupta era. The average height of the sculptures is 0.061 m, and most of them are allopenic Manasa bust female figures.
The terracotta sculptures found here brought the high-profile history of classical art practice to Pundravardhana in the Gupta era. There was no significant source of stone in the Bengali region. So the artist took the stone as a substitute for the terracotta medium, and created all the artefacts of blacksmiths with extraordinary artistic skills. In many cases it has crossed the art of stone sculpture Shushma. And the continuation of this tradition can be seen later in the period of Pala era in northern Bengal and in the terracotta plaques of the south-eastern Bengal during the period of Dev, Chandra period and in a different form in the Sultanate Bengal.

The Superior Shipbuilding Company was originally called the American Steel Barge Company, and based in Duluth, Minnesota. It was founded by Scottish Captain Alexander McDougall who founded it so he could produce his new whaleback ship, this was Whaleback Barge 101. In 1900 McDougall sold his firm to the American Ship Building Company which transferred the company to Superior, Wisconsin and renamed it Superior Shipbuilding Company, also called AmShip Superior. After World War I the yard stopped manufacturing ships and instead turned to repair work. They continued repairing ships until 1945 when American Ship Building Company decided to sell it. It was initially known as the Knudsen Brothers Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company. In 1955 it was renamed Fraser-Nelson Shipyards then Fraser Shipyards and still exists today.

C18orf63

Chromosome 18 open reading frame 63 is a protein which in humans is encoded by the C18orf63 gene. This protein is not yet well understood by the scientific community. Research has been conducted suggesting that C18orf63 could be a potential biomarker for early stage pancreatic cancer and breast cancer.
Gene.
This gene is located at band 22, sub-band 3, on the long arm of chromosome 18. It is composed of 5065 base pairs spanning from 74,315,875 to 74,359,187 bp on chromosome 18. The gene has a total of 14 exons. C18orf63 is also known by the alias DKFZP78G0119. No isoforms exist for this gene.
Expression.
C18orf63 has high expression in the testis. The gene shows low expression in the kidneys, liver, lung, and pelvis. There is no phenotype associated with this gene.
Promoter.
The promoter region for C18orf63 is 1163 bp long starting at 74,314,813 bp and ending at 74,315,975 bp. The promoter ID is GXP_4417391. The presence of multiple y-box binding transcription factors and SRY transcription factor binding sites suggest that C18orf63 is involved in male sex determination.
Protein.
The C18orf63 protein is composed up of 685 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 77230.50 Da, with a predicted isoelectric point of 9.83. No isoforms exist for this protein. This protein is rich in glutamine, isoleucine, lysine, and serine when compared to the average protein, but lacks in aspartic acid and glycine.
Structure.
In the predicted secondary structure for this protein there are a number of beta turns, beta strands and alpha helices. For C18orf63 48.6% of the protein is expected to form alpha helices and 28.6% of the structure is expected to be composed of beta strands.
Domains and Motifs.
The protein contains one domain of unknown function, DUF 4709, spanning from the 7th amino acid to the 280th amino acid. Motifs that are predicted to exist include an N-terminal motif, RxxL motif, and KEN conserving motif, which all signal for protein degradation. Another motif that is predicted to exist is a Wxxx motif, which facilitates entrance of PTS1 cargo proteins into the organellar lumen, and a RVxPx motif which allows protein transport from the trans-Golgi network to the plasma membrane of the cilia. There is also a bipartite nuclear localization signal at the end of the protein sequence. There is no trans-membrane domain present, indicating that C18orf63 is not a trans-membrane protein.
Post-Translational Modifications.
Post-translational modifications the protein is predicted to undergo include SUMOylation, PKC and CK2 phosphorylation, N-glycosylation, amiditation, and cleavage. There are six total PKC phosphorylation sites and 2 CK2 phosphorylation sites, 2 SUMOylation sites, and 2 N-glycosylation sites. There are no signal peptides present in this sequence.
Subcellular Location.
Due to the nuclear localization signal at the end of the protein sequence, C18orf63 is predicted to be nuclear. C18orf63 has also been predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria in addition to the nucleus.
Homology.
Orhologs.
Orthologs have been found in most eukaryotes, with the exception of the class "Amphibia". No human paralogs exist for C18orf63. The most distant homolog detectable is "Mizuhopecten yessoensis", sharing a 37% identity with the human protein sequence. The domain of unknown function was the only homologous domain present in the protein sequence, it was found to be highly conserved in all orthologs. The table below shows some examples of various orthologs for this protein.
Rate of Evolution.
C18orf63 is a mildly slow evolving protein. The protein evolves faster than Cytochorme C but slower than Betaglobin.
Interacting proteins.
Transcription factors of interest predicted to bind to the regulatory sequence include p53 tumor suppressors, SRY testis determining factors, Y-box binding transcription factors, and glucocorticoid responsive elements. The JUN protein was found to interact with C18orf63 through antibait co-immunoprecipitation. The JUN protein binds to the USP28 promoter in colorectal cancer cells and is involved in the activation of these cancer cells.
Clinical significance.
Mutations.
A variety of missense mutations occur in the human population for this protein. In the regulatory sequence missense mutations occur at two transcription factor binding sites. Transcription factors affected are glucocorticoid responsive elements and E2F-myc cell cycle regulars. There are eleven common mutations that occur that affect the protein sequence itself. None of these mutations affect predicted post-translational modifications the protein sequence undergoes.
Disease association.
C18orf63 has been associated with personality disorders, obesity, and type two diabetes through a genome-wide association study. Currently research has not shown if C18orf63 plays a direct role in any of these diseases.

Economic transparency

Economic transparency refers to banks and other financial institutions that have made data available about their financial position and condition. However, the definition depends on the perspective of different research areas through which it is examined, mainly monetary economics, international finance, corporate finance, and others (e.g. public economics, international trade, asset pricing, and labor economics). The WTO defines economic transparency as a “degree to which trade policies and practices, and the process by which they are established, are open and predictable.” (WTO’s 2014 glossary). United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2012) relates to transparency as to “a state of affairs in which the participants in the investment process are able to obtain sufficient information from each other in order to make informed decisions and meet obligations and commitments”. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) there are three main branches: transparency in economic policy, in the institutional structures surrounding the markets, and in the corporate sector.
Since financial crises in emerging market economies in the 1990s, the Asian financial crises in 1997-1998 among them, weakness of institutions, lack of transparency in actual balance-sheets of firms, unintelligible corporate structures, and incomprehensible financial markets have revealed as a fundamental issue. The following corporate fraud scandals in the United States and Europe (e.g. Enron, Tyco, WorldCom) in the early 2000s amplified the importance of this issue even more. Finally, the financial collapse of renowned industries provoked demands for greater transparency to help improve corporate governance in the United States and other industrialized countries.
Fiscal transparency is perceived to be essential for informed decision making, for guaranteeing some accountability, and for maintaining fiscal discipline.
Central banks differ considerably in the ways in which they have become more transparent. The Bank of England has been a leading example in this regard.
Role of asymmetric information.
So to consider the need for economic transparency, an asymmetrical distribution of information between different economic agents has to occur. Full transparency may not necessarily mean that all information is complete and publicly accessible, but that there is no asymmetry in distributing private information between those economic actors.
Increasing transparency contributes to the reduction of information asymmetries. Transparency concerning quality and intent (or effort) is sometimes referred to as ” ex-ante transparency“ (associated with predictability) whereby ” ex-post transparency“ means transparency of outcomes (associated with accountability). 
Two main types of problems resulting from asymmetries are adverse selection and moral hazard problems. The distinction between those two is based on timing: adverse selection regards behavior before a contract takes place whereas moral hazard describes a party’s action after the contract had already been made. The former is a consequence of a lack of information about quality. Varying knowledge of the quality of a product in the goods and services industry is referenced by the „lemons“ problem or described by the situation of both informed and uninformed investors participating in the financial markets. Another example from the labor market is the employer’s paucity of insight into the true prospective employee ‘s abilities. Moral hazard problems occur because of a shortage of information about intent. Then one party might engage in risky behavior or deceiving actions due to the lack of transparency (e.g. insured drivers acting riskier in the traffic). 
There is one additional problem arising from information asymmetry in information about scarcity of resources. Lack of transparency of prices causes an inefficient allocation of scarce resources.
Application in a principal-agent relationship.
A principal-agent relationship is one that agent acts on behalf of the principal. By the reason of different individual objectives, the principle demands the disclosure of information about effort and outcome to assure the agent does not act purely in their own interest. The application of transparency underlying the relationship between employer and employee, investor and firm (owner and manager) or the public and the government has two main objectives: predictability and accountability. Based on information about policy choices (“effort”) and the result (“outcome”) of the government’s (agent’s) decisions the public (”principal“) decides whether to keep or remove them from office. In public policy area the stress is on the “ex-post transparency” in the way that it improves the electorate’s ability to hold the government accountable. “Ex-ante” transparency is not very effective in assessing the government’s actions because the electorate is not familiar with what the optimal policy decisions should be. 
Cost-benefit analysis of transparency.
Increased transparency can improve an efficient allocation of resources, make governments more accountable, undermine the power of special interests, and thus lead to improved policies and institutions (Glennerster and Shin, 2008, p. 184). Furthermore, ”as improved transparency raises efficiency (especially the efficiency of investment in new technology), it has the potential to raise growth” (Forssbaeck and Oxelheim, 2015, p. 17).
It also decreases a firm’s or state’s cost of capital. This has been studied on investing behavior in emerging markets. Whenever there was insufficient transparency and negative information appeared, investors could not distinguish between individual firms and borrowers, thus they departed investments from the entire market. This explanation is also applicable to the 2008 global financial crisis. Banks did not have enough information on their partners’ solvency which led to the collapse of the interbank market. In conclusion, countries and companies with transparent policies have lower borrowing costs, get more investment, and are less susceptible to financial crises. 
Increasing transparency has many benefits as already stated, but also many costs. The expenses on the supplier‘s/sender’s side are based on production and dissemination. Likewise important are indirect costs of revealing strategic information. On one hand, this allows firms access to their competitors' know-how, thus increasing efficiency and growth in the entire industry. On the other, it implicates loss of competitive advantage and bargaining power which discourages firms to invest in research. Disclosing information might reduce information asymmetries between investors but may reveal sensitive information to rivals. Another example are privacy or integrity costs to the sender. Information like a genetic predisposition for a disease or medical information on family members if provided to insurance companies would streamline the pricing of insurance. However, for many disclosing this type of information would just not be tolerable. Besides these costs, there are so-called incentive effects. If the incentive for the sender is based on the results of (involuntary) monitoring, they make costly actions to (deceitfully) signal abilities. A perfect example of this are CEO compensations derived from the stock value which is impacted by the firm’s signaled ability. Unnecessary expenses of exaggerated signaling eventually lead to reducing the firm’s value. It can be also applicable to government officials’ intentions to signal abilities using public resources. 
The receiver/demander needs to process the content of the information which is also costly (proportionately to the preciseness of the information). 
Research shows that the marginal benefit of increasing transparency is decreasing. Leuz and Verrecchia (2000) discovered that if transparency reaches a certain point, further disclosure of information has little power on decreasing the firm’s cost of capital. In agreement with that, Plummer and Tafti found that the third world countries, where transparency tends to be underdeveloped, have most to benefit by increasing policy transparency. Some even suggest the marginal benefit is negative beyond a certain point. If imprecise, sharing too much information with the public might cause inefficiency. Let’s say a public body (e.g. a central bank) reveals uncertainty in future decision-making related to a certain commodity. (e.g. interest). The private sector overreacts and volatility in the market for this commodity escalates (Geraats, 2002). 
Socio-economic transparency mechanisms.
For economic transparency to remedy the asymmetricity, there has to some mechanism for information to be transferred from ”the sender“ (the informed) to ”the receiver“ (the uninformed). Since transparency has a demand-side as well, to increase it the information has to be relevant to the receiver’s decision making. To improve the freedom of choice these mechanisms signal the implications of one’s socioeconomic choices. There are again two engaging parties: the reporter who enters the information into the instrument and the inquirer who searches for information related to socio-economical choices.
Examples:
All of these mechanisms face the following challenges:
The US's perspective.
Transparency and openness can help accelerate reforms in developing countries in situations which foreign aid and other US programmatic and diplomatic efforts will have less potency and influence. It can promote responsible practices that directly and indirectly support a broad range of US policy objectives, such as (1) exposing government corruption, (2) reducing the scope for government revenues to be siphoned offshore, (3) increasing collection of domestic tax revenues, (4) increasing the accountability and effectiveness of government spending (including aid), (5) reducing dependency on foreign aid, and (6) helping to prevent money laundering and terrorist finance.

Paul Winfree

Paul Winfree serves as director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies and is also the "Richard F. Aster Fellow" at The Heritage Foundation. He is also the founder and president of N58 Policy Research. Winfree is also member of the J. William Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board. He previously was Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic policy, Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council, and Director of Budget Policy at the White House during the first year of the Trump administration.
Education.
Winfree is a graduate of George Mason University, from where he graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics. Afterwards, he completed a Master’s program at the London School of Economics and Political Science, focusing on Economics and Economic History. He was enrolled as a PhD student at London School of Economics when he was drawn to applying economics to public policy.
Career.
In 2006, Winfree took a job at The Heritage Foundation, where he researched issues of economic mobility and coauthored a book on that topic published by the Pew Charitable Trusts. 
Between 2011 and 2015, Winfree was director of income security at the Senate Budget Committee. In this capacity, he contributed greatly to implementing deficit-neutral risk corridor legislation in the Affordable Care Act.
In 2015, Winfree returned to The Heritage Foundation, serving as Director of the Thomas A. Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, the Center for Data Analysis, as well as becoming the inaugural Richard F. Aster Fellow. His research there focused on public finance, economic modeling, and the history of economic thought. In this capacity, he was lead-authoring the 165-page "Blueprint for Balance" proposal, which later became an important idea-giver for the Trump transition team, of which Winfree eventually became a part of.
During the 2016 Presidential transition, Winfree worked alongside Linda M. Springer, a member of the George W. Bush administration, looking forward to achieve a more direct political impact. In November 2016, he stated that President-elect Trump was highly interested in questions of domestic policy.
Winfree became the Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, the Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council, and the Director of Budget Policy in January 2017. As Chair of the Deputies Committee, Winfree coordinated all domestic policy at the Deputy Secretary level within the administration and the interagency policy coordination process. Winfree and former Representative OMB Director, Mick Mulvaney, were lead authors of the administration’s budget proposition.
Winfree also authored and lead the administration of the President’s Executive Order number 13781, with the objective of establishing "A Comprehensive Plan for Reorganizing the Executive Branch." Winfree was also the author of the Executive Order number 13828 on "Reducing poverty in America by promoting opportunity and economic mobility."
Paul Winfree left the White House and returned to Heritage at the end of 2017, in a move which was anticipated by media and policy experts in Washington, who saw him as well as several other early members of the Trump administration leave after one year in office.
Paul Winfree also was founder and president of N58 Policy Research, a firm that provided analytical research and strategy for decision makers in matters of public policy.
Publications.
Winfree has published a number of papers on fiscal policy and public finance. He is currently finishing a book on the history of the U.S. budget process.
Winfree has published numerous articles in "The Hill" and his research was featured in publications including "The New York Times", "The Wall Street Journal", "USA Today", "Congressional Quarterly", "Investor's Business Daily", and "Morning Consult".

 Lam Wan Kit (; born 25 November 1987 in Hong Kong) is a Hong Kong footballer who plays for Hong Kong First Division club Central &amp; Western.
Career.
Lam signed his first professional contract at age 19 with Sun Hei in 2006. Due to his need to balance his part time work and football life, he did train enough to show improvement as a player and was not retained the following season.
In 2012, Lam returned to Sun Hei, making 10 appearances for the club. However, at the conclusion of the 2013-14 season, Sun Hei declined to join the new fully professional Hong Kong Premier League leaving Lam without a contract for the following season.
After a brief stint with Sun Source at the start of the 2014-15 season, Lam spent the remainder of the campaign with Double Flower where he made 22 league appearances for the club.
The following season, Lam signed with Eastern District where he helped the club to reach promotion after a runners-up finish in the 2015-16 Second Division table.
In a bid to return to the top flight, Lam went on trial with several new HKPL clubs during the summer of 2016. He eventually signed with R&amp;F and made his debut on 18 September in a Senior Shield match against Biu Chun Glory Sky.
Ahead of the 2017-18 season, Lam moved to fellow HKPL club Dreams. He made his debut on 31 December 2017 in a 2017–18 Hong Kong FA Cup first round loss to Lee Man.

In June 2018, amid criticism from banking authorities, Estcoin's plans were revised to no longer peg its value to the euro, nor for it to be a national cryptocurrency, but that Estonia would plans to “explore various possibilities” for blockchain technology. As it will be restricted to individuals within the Estonia e-Residency program, it cannot be exchanged freely and thus technically doesn't qualify as a cryptocurrency.

Vietnamese refugees in Israel

From 1977 to 1979 the State of Israel permitted approximately 360 Vietnamese boat people fleeing the 1975 Communist takeover of Vietnam to enter the country. The most well-known rescue operation took place on June 10, 1977 in which an Israeli freighter ship called the "Yuvali," en route to Taiwan, sighted the passengers.
Prime Minister Menachem Begin was quoted as having compared them to Holocaust refugees:"We never have forgotten the boat with 900 Jews, the "St. Louis", having left Germany in the last weeks before the Second World War… traveling from harbor to harbor, from country to country, crying out for refuge. They were refused… Therefore it was natural… to give those people a haven in the Land of Israel."An Associated Press broadcast from October 26, 1979 covered one of the arrival flights in which a refugee stated he would like to thank the government of Israel and Prime Minister Menachem Begin "to give us a homeland while the other countries were still reluctant to take us when we left our country to flee from the barbaric regime of communism."
The "Times of Israel", in a special report in 2015 quoted the Vietnamese Embassy in Israel that approximately 150 to 200 former Vietnamese refugees and descendants were still in Israel while about half have left Israel mainly for the USA and France.
Prominent Vietnamese Israelis include: Vaan Nguyen, a poet and actress and subject of an award-winning documentary "The Journey of Vaan Nguyen," Dr. Sabine Huynh, a translator, sociologist and author who fled Vietnam for France in 1976 and has lived in Israel since 2001, and Dao Rochvarger-Wong, who headed Bank Hapoalim in Singapore.

Trains of the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij were initially running from Hilversum to Utrecht Lunetten, also serving Utrecht Biltstraat (demolished in 1961) and Utrecht Maliebaan; since 1939, all trains coming from Hilversum are going to Utrecht Centraal via a connection with the Utrecht–Kampen railway. It connects the Amsterdam–Zutphen with the Amsterdam–Arnhem railway.
The railway was electrified between 1941 and 1942. Utrecht Maliebaan became the national railway museum in 1954 and the Maliebaan–Lunetten part of the railway became a bicycle path in 2017. Lunetten station is still in use, however nowadays being located further south on the Utrecht–Boxtel railway.

<doc id="56633516" url="?curid=56633516" title="Multisensory learning">
Multisensory learning

Multisensory learning is the assumption that individuals learn better if they are taught using more than one sense (modality). The senses usually employed in multisensory learning are visual, auditory, kinesthetic, and tactile – VAKT (i.e. seeing, hearing, doing, and touching). Other senses might include smell, taste and balance (e.g. making vegetable soup or riding a bicycle).
Multisensory learning is different from learning styles which is the assumption that people can be classified according to their learning style (audio, visual or kinesthetic). However, critics of learning styles say there is no consistent evidence that identifying an individual student's learning style and teaching for that style will produce better outcomes. Consequently, learning styles has not received widespread support from scientists, nor has it proven to be effective in the classroom. (For more on this see learning styles.)
Reports suggest the human brain has evolved to process multisensory signals, making it more natural than unisensory processing. Recent research has made clear that multisensory processing of information is part of daily life, whereby the brain integrates the information from different modalities (senses) into a coherent mental perception.
Some studies conclude that the benefits of multisensory learning are greatest if the senses are engaged concurrently (see Multisensory integration) and the instruction is direct (explicit) and systematic (see ). However, some neurologists question whether more is "actually better for learners who are struggling". The rational is that learners with developmental disorders may have impairments in cognitive control, planning and attention, so multisensory integration might place additional demands on systems that are already straining. Consequentially, it is suggested, it may be better to narrow the alternatives to one that works. Other studies suggest that multisensory integration only develops optimally by middle childhood (i.e. eight years of age or older).
According to the U.K. Independent review of the teaching of early reading (Rose Report 2006) multisensory learning is also effective because it keeps students more engaged in their learning. In 2010 the U.K. Department for Education established the core criteria for programs that teach school children to read by using systematic Synthetic phonics. It includes a requirement that the material "uses a multi-sensory approach so that children learn variously from simultaneous visual, auditory and kinaesthetic activities which are designed to secure essential phonic knowledge and skills".
The following organizations recommend multisensory instruction for learners with a learning disability: The International Dyslexia Association (IDA) and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD). And one study says there is strong support for using multisensory experiences to increase the focus of students with special needs. One of the oldest proponents of multisensory phonics for remedial reading instruction is Orton-Gillingham, dating back to 1935. What Works Clearinghouse, a part of the Institute of Education Sciences reports there is a lack of studies meeting its strict evidence standards so it is "unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of unbranded Orton-Gillingham–based strategies for students with learning disabilities". However, "Best Evidence Encyclopedia", a part of Johns Hopkins School of Education found one qualifying study that showed an effect size of +0.43.

Forest in Germany

The forest in Germany covers 11.4 million hectares, 32 percent of the total area of the country (as of 2012). In the German forests grow about 90 billion young and old trees with a total wood stock of 3.7 billion cubic meters.
The definition of the Federal Forest Act (BWaldG) for forest is: "any area planted with forest plants. Forest also includes clear-cut or shaded ground areas, forest roads, forest clearance and securing strips, forest meadows and clearings, forest meadows, grass clearing areas, wood storage areas and other areas associated with and serving the forest."
Woodland.
According to the results of the Third Federal Forest Inventory (2012), Germany has 11,419,124 hectares, 32.0 percent of the land area planted with forest. Of these, 11,054,162 hectares are wood flooring and 364,962 hectares are non-wood flooring. The German forest area increased in the period between 2002 and 2012 by a total of 49,597 hectares or 0.4 percent. 
During this period, around 108,000 hectares of new forest were created, while around 58,000 hectares of existing forest area were lost.
The federal state with the largest forest area is Bavaria with 2.6 million hectares of forest. The largest proportion of forestation in the country surface, each with 42.3 percent, are Hessen and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The Federal Statistical Office records the forest area according to other parameters than the Federal Forest Inventory. It is based on the so-called "actual use" of the real estate cadastre. As of 31 December 2015, the Federal Statistical Office for Germany has a forest area of 109,515 km². According to the Federal Statistical Office, the area of German forests has increased by 4,979 km² since 31 December 1992.
Forest owners.
In Germany there are about 2 million forest owners. In addition to forest owners, forest owners also include beneficial owners, provided that they are the direct owners of the forest. 
The forest property types are defined as follows according to § 3 of the Federal Forest Act (BWaldG):
State forest: forest in sole ownership of the federal government, a state or an institution or a foundation under public law as well as forest in co-ownership of a country, insofar as it is regarded as state forest according to state regulations.
Corporate Forest: forest owned by municipalities, municipal associations, special purpose associations and other public bodies. Excluded is the forest of religious communities and their institutions, as well as of real associations, Hauberggenossenschaften, Markgenossenschaften, Gehöferschaften and similar communities (Gemeinschaftsforsten), as far as he is not regarded under state law as a corporate forest.
Private forest: Forest that is neither state nor corporate forest.
According to the surveys of the Federal Forest Inventory, 48.0 percent of the German forest area is private forest, 29.0 percent state forest of the federal states, 19.4 percent corporate forest and 3.5 percent federal state forest. The federal state with the largest private forest share is North Rhine-Westphalia with 66.8 percent. With 46.1 percent, Rhineland-Palatinate has the highest share of corporate forests. The state forest dominates with 50.1 percent area share in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
In Germany there are 16 state forestry enterprises: 15 forestry companies of the countries (except Bremen) and the Federal Forestry. The largest forest owner in Germany is the Free State of Bavaria with around 778,000 hectares, which are mainly managed by the Bavarian State Forests (BaySF).
The number of corporate forests in Germany is estimated at 60,000, with an average size of 38 hectares. The Klosterkammer Hannover has 24,400 hectares, the largest German corporate forest. The largest municipal forest owner is the city of Brilon with 7,750 hectares of forest.
The private forest in Germany is distributed to almost 2 million owners. The average size of German private forests is 3 hectares. While the property size class covers more than 1,000 hectares, only 13 percent of the private forest area, 50 percent of the area and 98 percent of the owners in the small private forest to 20 hectares in size. The DBU Naturerbe GmbH is with about 69,000 hectares of total area (including open land areas) the largest private forest owner in Germany. Around 150,000 hectares of forest are distributed by the churches in Germany to more than 6,500 legal entities (parishes, monasteries, foundations, bishoprics). Even though the churches are for the most part public corporations, the church forest is a private forest.
Tree species.
The Third Federal Forest Inventory in 2012 recorded 51 tree species and tree species groups in German forests. The spruce stands for the largest proportion of the wooded floor are 26.0 percent, followed by the pines at 22.9 percent, the beech at 15.8 percent and the oak at 10.6 percent. Common tree species in the German forests are also the hanging birch (Betula pendula), the common ash (Fraxinus excelsior), the black alder (Alnus glutinosa), the European larch (Larix decidua), the common Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and the sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus).
Forest modification and tree species change.
By nature, the German forest would be strongly influenced by deciduous trees, in particular red beech (Fagus sylvatica). Today's tree species composition with high proportions of coniferous trees reflects the forest use of the past centuries. From the Middle Ages to the early 19th century, many forests in Germany were over-used or beaten to pieces. In order to avert an imminent wood problem, these devastated forests and areas were reforested in the context of sustainable forestry on the better soils with good water supply often with common spruce (Picea abies) and on the nutrient-poorer and drier locations with pine (Pinus sylvestris).
These two robust tree species are better able to cope with the difficult ecological conditions on clear-cutting land than frost-sensitive tree species such as European beech and white fir (Abies alba) and also provide high timber yields. Even during and after the two world wars caused by the destruction of the war, the Reparationshiebe and the wood requirements for the reconstruction large Kahlflächen on which often pure populations of spruce and pine were established. The forest owners and foresters of the time provided a great cultural achievement with the reconstruction of the forests - given the large areas and limited resources available.

SMS G96

SMS "G96" was a large torpedo boat of the Imperial German Navy that was built and served during the First World War. She was the prototype ship of the 1916 Mobilisation Type torpedo boats, and was launched at Germaniawerft's Kiel shipyard on 19 September 1916, completing in December that year.
"G96" was deployed to the Flanders Flotilla in February 1917 and took part in several raids on British shipping in the English Channel. She was sunk by a mine on 26 June 1917.
Construction and design.
Work began in 1915 on construction of "G96", the first example of an improved design of torpedo boat for the Imperial German Navy, which became known as the 1916 mobilisation type. The 1916 mobilisation type was an improved and enlarged derivative of the that had formed the bulk of German torpedo boat construction since 1913. The major differences were a longer forecastle and more freeboard, both of which improved seakeeping.
"G96" was long overall and at the waterline, with a beam of and a draught of . The ship displaced design and deep load.
Three oil-fired water-tube boilers fed steam at to two sets of Germania direct-drive steam turbines, each of which drove a propeller shaft. The starboard shaft was also fitted with a cruising turbine. The machinery was rated at , giving a design speed of . Two funnels were fitted. 326 t of oil was carried, giving a range of at .
The ship was armed with three 10.5 cm (4.1 in) SK L/45 guns and six 50 cm (19.7 in) torpedo tubes, with two single tubes forward and two twin tubes aft of the ship's funnels, with the twin tubes angled out by 15 degrees. Up to 40 mines could be carried. The ship had a crew of 105 officers and men.
"G96" was launched on 16 September 1916 and was completed on 23 December that year.
Service.
In February 1917, "G96" was one of six large torpedo boats and four coastal torpedo boats that were sent as reinforcements to the German naval bases in Flanders, with the role of supporting submarine operations and carrying out offensive operations against the anti-submarine patrols and merchant shipping in the English Channel. "G96" and the other nine torpedo boats arrived in Flanders on 18 February. On 25 February the Germans launched a major raid by the Flanders-based torpedo boats against Allied defences and shipping in the Channel. One group of five torpedo boats (the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla - , , , and "G96") were to operate against shipping near the North Foreland lighthouse and The Downs, while a second group of six torpedo boats (the 6th Flotilla) were to attack the patrol boats of the Dover Barrage, while three more torpedo boats were to attack shipping off the mouth of the River Maas. "G96" s group carried out a brief bombardment of the North Foreland and Margate before withdrawing, hitting a house and killing three civilians but doing little other damage. The attack on the Dover Barrage withdrew after a confrontation with the British destroyer , while the patrol off the Mass encountered no ships.
The next major raid on the Channel took place on the night of March 17/18 1917. Two groups of torpedo boats, the seven ships of the 6th Flotilla and the five ships of the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla ("V47", "V67", "V68", "G95" and "G96") were to operate against the Dover Barrage, with the 6th Flotilla attacking on the Northern side of the Channel and the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla operating to the south. Four more torpedo boats would attack shipping on the Downs. The 6th Flotilla encountered the British destroyer , on patrol in the Channel, and opened fire with guns and torpedoes. "Paragon" was hit by at least two torpedoes and sank. On seeing the explosion, , the next destroyer in the British patrol line, proceeded southwards to investigate, and had just switched on her searchlight to rescue survivors when she was torpedoed and badly damaged by ships of the German 6th Flotilla, which escaped to the east, joining up with the torpedo boats of the 1st Zeebrugge half-flotilla, including "G96". The attack on the Downs sank a small steamer, the "Greypoint" and attacked several drifters on patrol.
The Flanders-based torpedo boat flotillas continued to launch sorties against the Channel, with the next encounter with the Royal Navy occurring on the night of April 20/21, in the Battle of Dover Strait. Six torpedo boats (Group Gautier) were to bombard Dover and attack the Dover Barrage on the north side of the channel, with six more (Group Albrecht – "V47", "V68", , , "G95" and "G96") were to attack Calais and the southern part of the barrage. Three more torpedo boats were to operate near the Downs. Group Albrecht arrived off Calais at about 23:15 hr and fired about 300 shells before withdrawing. Group Gautier fired on and damaged an armed trawler, the "Sabreur", and ineffectually shelled Dover. On the return journey they were intercepted by the British destroyers and which sank the torpedo boats and .
Another major role of the Flanders-based torpedo boat flotillas was minesweeping, with the British laying extensive minefields to restrict operations of Flanders-based submarines. On 25 June 1917 "G96" was escorting minesweepers clearing a minefield off the Flanders coast when she stuck a mine and sank. Four of her crew were killed.

Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet

Sir Henry Russell, 2nd Baronet (1783–1852), was the son of Sir Henry Russell, 1st Baronet and his wife, Anne Barbara Whitworth 1763-1814.
Career in India.
He was appointed British Resident to the court of Pune in 1809. He was then appointed to the more important court of Hyderabad State from 1810 until 1820, when he retired to England.
Russell was Private Secretary and assistant to James Achilles Kirkpatrick, British Resident at Hyderabad from 1798 until his death in 1805. Russell's career is discussed in some detail in William Dalrymple's 2002 history of British India, "White Mughals", where he figures as a gifted but weak diplomat who, following the death of his superior, Kirkpatrick, seduced then abandoned Kirkpatrick's widow.
Russell resigned the Residency in 1820 to avert an investigation for corruption which would have led to his removal from office in disgrace. On an annual salary of £3,400, he had managed to accumulate a fortune of £85,000 over 10 years. In retirement he lived first at Sutton Park in Bedfordshire, then at Southernhay House, an architecturally notable listed building in Exeter. It was a newly built, freestanding, classical mansion of pillared grandeur.
Marriages and Children.
In October 1808 he married Jane Amelia Casamajor in Madras who died suddenly just two months later. A subsequent liaison with a local lady resulted in the birth of his daughter, who he named Mary Wilson in 1815. This child was brought to England when he retired, and was brought up in complete secrecy, with Sir Henry's friend, Major Robert Pitman, acting as go-between. He provided an allowance for her, but refused to let Major Pitman tell her the identity of her father. Mary married the Reverend William Langston Coxhead in 1839, who was incumbent of Kirby le Soken, Essex.
Sir Henry went on to marry a French Catholic from Pondicherry, Marie Clothilde Mottet de Fontaine 1793-1872 by whom he had six children.
Swallowfield Park.
In 1820 the Russell family - Sir Henry senior, and his two most successful sons, Charles and Sir Henry junior, pooled their resources purchased Swallowfield Park, near Reading, Berkshire, where they and their descendants remained for over 150 years.
A focus on Swallowfield Park and the history of the Russells' life there can be found in "The East India Company at Home 1757 - 1857" edited by Margot Finn and Kate Smith, published by UCL Press 2018

King Trigger were a British band. They are best known for their single "The River" (called "River" on the single sleeve and on the LP track listing), which charted at No. 57 in the UK Singles Chart (four weeks in the chart, starting 14 August 1982), and No. 32 in Australia (three weeks in the chart, starting 1 November 1982).
The band formed as Screaming King Trigger, from a previous band called Scoop. They attracted the attention of the Thompson Twins, who gave them a support slot on a UK tour. This brought them to the attention of Chrysalis Records. They were on the cover of "Melody Maker" in February 1982, before they had even recorded.
They were covered in "NME" soon after (8 May 1982 issue), the journalist comparing their music to Pigbag, Bow Wow Wow and Adam and the Ants.
They recorded one album, "Screaming", produced by Steve Lillywhite, in 1982. The album did not chart, and nor did the second single, "Temptation". The album was reissued in 2007.

Wendy Taylor (physicist)

Wendy Taylor is an Experimental Particle Physicist at York University and a former Canada Research Chair. She is the lead for York University's ATLAS experiment group at CERN.
Education.
Taylor graduated from the University of British Columbia with Bachelors of Science in Physics in 1991. As an undergraduate, she worked at TRIUMF, working on rare kaon decay. She completed her graduate studies at the University of Toronto, where she earned a PhD under the supervision of Pekka Sinervo in 1999. She worked on fragmentation properties of the bottom quark. She worked at Stony Brook University as a postdoctoral fellow. She worked on Fermilab's D0 experiment, building electronics to detect bottom quark particles in real time.
Research.
Taylor's research focuses on the magnetic monopole. To do this, she is using the ATLAS detector. Her lab concentrated on the development of firmware for the transition radiation tracker within the ATLAS experiment. She is motivated by predictions from Grand Unified Theory, the observation of quantised charge and potential to reinforce the symmetry in Maxwell's equations.
Taylor spent five years working at the Tevatron particle accelerator. She was concerned when it lost government funding in 2011. Whilst working at the Fermilab Tevatron particle accelerator, Taylor identified CP violation in the decay of bottom quarks, which could contribute to the dominance of matter in the universe. The rate at which she detected CP violation was two-orders of magnitude larger than that predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics.
She joined York University in 2004, where she was one of two women in the department. She held a Canada Research Chair between 2004 and 2014.
Taylor is a member of the American Physical Society and the Particle Physics Division of the Canadian Association of Physicists.

Lion (1796 ship)

Lion was launched in the Netherlands in 1789. She was taken in prize . On her first voyage under British ownership she was under contract to the British East India Company (EIC). She was lost in 1798 on the homeward-bound leg of her voyage to India.
Career.
One source states that "Lion" was built as "Leuve" for the Dutch East India Company (VOC) and captured at Saldanha Bay in 1795. However, the most comprehensive database of VOC voyages has no record of a "Leuve", or even of a "Leuuw" (the Dutch word for lion) fitting the dates and circumstances. The list of Dutch merchant vessels captured at Simon's Bay in connection with the British capture of Saldanha Bay also does not list a suitable vessel.
"Lion" entered "Lloyd's Register" in 1796 with Thompson, master, Camden, owner, and trade London–East Indies. The 1797 volume of "Lloyd's Register" shows her owner as Calvert &amp; Co.
"Lion" sailed on 3 April 1796 to India for the EIC. It is not clear who her captain was. "Lloyd's Register" showed it as Thompson, but an account of her loss gave it as Sever.
"Lion" was at Delagoa Bay in late June 1798, having put in in distress as she was returning to England from Madras and Colombo.
There, on 28 June 1798, Captain Sever chartered three whalers, , Kerr, master, and two other English ships, "London", Keen, master, and , Hopper, master, to carry "Lion"s cargo back to England. "Lion" had been carrying a cargo from Madras and Colombo to England when she had put into Delagoa Bay in distress. Despite the efforts of the three other English ships and three American ships there, "Lion" could not be saved. Most of her officers and crew abandoned her on 18 July. 
"Lloyd's List" simply reported on 21 December that "Lion" had been condemned at Delagoa Bay and that three whalers had been hired to bring back her cargo.
The EIC put the value of its cargo aboard her at £8,272.

Jerry Paper

Lucas Nathan (born August 7, 1990), better known by their stage name Jerry Paper, is an American songwriter and producer who has been releasing music since 2009. Their first projects were Zonotope™ and the noise music project Diane Kensington Devotional Band. They began performing under the alias Jerry Paper in 2012, releasing their latest album, "Abracadabra" via Stones Throw Records in 2020.
Early life.
Nathan said that as a child, they were influenced to learn music by the fact that "all [their] friends were making music." They learned how to play ""The Simpsons" Theme" on the piano when they were five, played bongos for their school band, and were a drummer. Shortly after they learned how to play the Misfits song "London Dungeon" on bass guitar in eighth grade, they made psychedelic folk recordings in their bedroom with Sony Acid and performed in various bands at school. The first group they were in was a comedy rock band named The Corrupt Ice Cream Vendors. They got into several noise and psychedelic acts like Growing and Devendra Banhart in their teen years after being exposed to them via the magazine "Arthur", and later got into free jazz and krautrock. Nathan originally wanted to perform in the "cool band[s]" that they saw at school and at their summer camps, but they were turned down by all of them due to their "nerdy" looks, which influenced them to become a solo artist.
Career.
2009–2012: Zonotope™ and Diane Kensington Devotional Band.
Nathan stated that as a "pretentious teenager", they "refused to listen to anything that wasn't 1966 to 1968." Therefore, it was "part of [their] personality" that they despised electronic music. By the time they were experimenting with their friend's Roland HS-60 synthesizer, however, Nathan reports in an interview that they were fascinated by the sounds it produced. This inspired them to make electronic music as a way of taking the "challenge" of "find[ing] a way to like" the genre. Nathan began producing music in 2009, and their first project was Zonotope™, a four-album "propaganda series" promoting a Southern California-based "alternative spiritual community" named the Temple of Pure Information and Mainframe Devotion. they also had a noise project named Diane Kensington Devotional Band, which depicts Nathan as a female who starts the Wellness Group. It's for a fictional religion based on traveling into the inaccessible-to-most infinite "space between the 1 and the 0" through a method named "Trance Channels."
2012–2015: Jerry Paper.
The name of Jerry Paper first appeared in the credits of the Zonotope™ album "Excellent Realms" (2010), where Paper was given a "special thanks" for "building The Mainframe." The story of the project involves Paper quitting from the spiritual community setting of Zonotope™ to find a "less orthodox alternative spirituality." Nathan described the music of Jerry Paper as "slightly less abstract" than their works for Zonotope™, and the project's titular character is caused by a "ritual" that transforms Nathan into Jerry Paper. Paper often wears a garland and a silk robe and acts like a "weirdo" who does "whatever the hell [they want]," such as become "romantically involved with a giant chameleon" and dance "like someone who just discovered movement five minutes ago," Koen van Bommel stated.
Nathan explained that they wrote "International Man of Misery" (2013), "a cartoonish version of depression," as a way to poke fun on the "ridiculously melodramatic thoughts" they went through at the time. "Fuzzy Logic" (2013) is about how modern living is complicated by technology and politics.
"Feels Emotion", released on February 11, 2014, involved Nathan taking on, as "Decoder" magazine put it, more "ambitious" production techniques than their previous albums such as in sampling, an example being the cat sounds on "Holy Shit." The LP also has some tracks where Nathan focused on non-repetitive pop structures instead of the typical verse–chorus form, including "I Feel Emotions," "Unless It’s," "Other Please," and "Heartbreak Module #3."
On August 24, 2014, Nathan released what they considered their "first successful concept album," the Jerry Paper LP "Big Pop For Chameleon World", a soundtrack for their Unity game "Dr. Javer's Genneheigen's Chameleon World". 
The album explores simulacra, looking for "the dividing line" between a real object and a simulated version of it. In doing so, it uses synthesized replications of acoustic instruments, such as a square wave keyboard sound meant to be a harpsichord texture. According to "The Fader", the use of these sounds gives the album a more "uncanny" vibe than Nathan's previous releases.
2015–present.
The same palette of instruments were later used on their next album "Carousel" (2015).
For making "Carousel", Nathan wrote the songs in the same manner as for their previous release; however, the analog keyboard Nathan usually used for creating their music had broke, meaning they had to rely on digital synthesizer sounds for "Carousel". they said the album consisted of a bunch of "hilarious sounds." As they described making the LP's lead single, "I was just trying to come up with the funniest sounds to go together – like tubular bells, and standup bass, and harpsichord, and then it goes into disco funk."
"Toon Time Raw!" was recorded with the band BadBadNotGood at their studio in Toronto. The band acted as Nathan's anonymous backing band, being billed as "Easy Feelings Unlimited". "Toon Time Raw!" involves anthropomorphic animals dealing with human issues. The record was performed with a record release party on June 19, 2016 at Brooklyn's art gallery place Secret Project Robot. It was Nathan's first headlining performance that they performed with a backing band, a contrast from their previous live performances where they sang with machines performing the backing tracks. As Madison Bloom of "Audiofemme" covered the event, "it was an evening of undeniably odd birds, but what a wonderful thing to see when so many modern bands are required to be ultra slick and fronted by supermodels," and the band's setup had "great versatility via keyboards, guitar, pedal effects, and flute."
On September 15, 2017, American rapper Kari Faux released "Gotta Know," a track from her extended play "Primary". Nathan produced the track under the Jerry Paper pseudonym and also received a "featuring" credit on the song. Faux noticed Nathan's work via the "suggested artists" feature on Spotify, and, as she explained, she "was stuck on [their] music for a good three months, that was all I was listening to, and I would catch myself rapping to [them]." This led her to contact Nathan via Twitter before the two came together personally in Los Angeles to collaborate. "Like a Baby" was released in 2018. "Your Cocoon" and "Grey Area" debuted on the website Bandcamp as promotional singles for the album, which features Weyes Blood and Charlotte Day Wilson as collaborators. According to the Stones Throw Records website, the album delves into existential topics pertaining to "the endless human cycle of desire and satisfaction".
On May 15, 2020 Nathan released a new album titled "Abracadabra". The song "Quicksand" was teased first while "Puppeteer" and "Cholla" were released on their Bandacamp profile and Spotify.
Musical style and philosophies.
During their teen years living in Los Angeles, Nathan visited several Scientology and Mormon centers. It was during this time that they got into direct experience, the idea that language cannot clearly state what someone gains via sensory perception. This, as well as their love for the "ritual" of religion, would later become the basis of how they develop their music: "Musical sounds act as symbols, but they carry information that can bypass linguistic processing. That was my main focus. I wanted to investigate that freaky idea." They explained that "instead of trying to explain mystical experience," they "try to create a context and a vocabulary that maybe gets at [a philosophy] slightly more."
Nathan is into the idea of fuzzy logic, or what goes on between the binary numbers of zero and one. Their Diane Kensington project and the title track of the Jerry Paper album "Fuzzy Logic" are based on the concept. As they opined, "Binaries are a very helpful way to deal with things. They’re a pretty good tool when it comes to categorizing the world and figuring things out. But it’s not actually how the world works." Another primary purpose for Nathan making music is to keep "put[ting] [them]self in uncomfortable situations."
Nathan's reason for producing and performing music under alter egos like Jerry Paper is that they help them figure out more about their actual self: 
Nathan stated in an interview with "The Editorial Magazine" that they feel machines are just as human as actual human beings due to having "a lot of quirks." This translates into Nathan's musical style, which Bloom described as "genre-less" but compared to Daft Punk in that it combines the "coldness of technology with the foolproof warmth of human music." Nathan explains that musically, their works play around with the limitations of pop music. This limitation aspect of their works was inspired by the piano-only works of Henry Cowell: "He has that piece, "The Banshee," where he’s scraping his finger nails on the piano strings. Fucking incredible. He used the piano in a different way." This is why, until "Toon Time Raw!", they didn't use MIDI software because they would've otherwise "ha[d] a huge amount of choices."
Music production.
Nathan spends most of their home time recording in their bedroom, which consists of only one mattress and two cardboard boxes that serve as their "closet." As they explained, they get "static anxiety" to finish a project once they start work on it: "I’d have to say that in each song I write, I have fun for maybe 10 minutes max out of the who-knows-how-many hours I put in. The motivation is not the pleasure of doing but the satisfaction of finishing." The drum machines they use varies from album to album, although there have been certain machines they have used consistently since they started their Jerry Paper project such as Taal Tarang Digital kicks and Roland TR-727 percussion. They also avoid using loops or repeated parts in their works: "I feel like setting that limitation for myself makes me write and record different kind of songs than those I’d write if they were based on loops."
Themes.
Nathan, in both their songs and the music videos for them, takes on comic views of real life because, in their words, the "world isn’t so serious." All of Nathan's music attempts to get a view of alternate universes, and "because I feel that music isn’t really the arena for truth, I often write lyrics focusing on the irrational," they said. In terms of live stage performances, Nathan dances in comic yet profound routines and delivers, in a deadpan tone, indifferent aphorisms that are also in the lyrics of their songs. As they said while performing live at their release party for "Toon Time Raw!", “It’s great to be alive. But having a body is sooo annoying. But you are a body, so…fuck it."
A common major theme in Nathan's records is anxieties, how they "feel very immediate and true in the moment but in hindsight often register as products of absurd logic." The lyrics of their works represent feelings of hopelessness and concern of where to go in life in the future, which are translated "into a subtly self-aware revision of easy listening," "Decoder" analyzed. As Bloom stated, "Though wearing the guise of empathetic AI and employing tools of the Muzak genre such as keyboard saxophone and elevator synths, they manages to make sincere, and more importantly good music that is relatable to humans and algorithms alike."
Personal life.
Born and raised in Los Angeles, Nathan went to Manhattan when they began attending The New School in 2008 to study sociomusicology and philosophy of religion. They lived in Brooklyn as of 2014, but relocated back to California in 2016. They are married. Nathan is non-binary and uses they/them pronouns.

St. Dominic Catholic Church (Washington, D.C.)

St. Dominic Church is a parish of the Roman Catholic Church, established in 1852. It is located in Southwest Washington, D.C., in the Archdiocese of Washington, and is administered by the Order of Preachers, more commonly known as the Dominicans, in the Province of St. Joseph (Eastern).
Location.
The historic parish church and priory are located at 630 E St SW in Washington, near the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and L'Enfant Plaza, and three blocks south of the National Mall. The nearest Metro station is L'Enfant Plaza Station.
History.
Origins.
St. Dominic Church was built on land held by Catholic families or institutions since at least 1735. The land was owned by widow Ann Rozier Carroll, a relative of Charles Carroll, signer of the Declaration of Independence. Carroll remarried to Benjamin Young, Commissioner of Crown Lands. Although Maryland was founded by Catholic Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore as the first English colony in America permitting religious freedom, the English government took over Maryland's government following the Protestant Revolution in 1689. Under English rule, Benjamin Young lost his post when he became Catholic. The family lived at a manor house with a private house chapel on what is now G St. SW between 9th and 10th St. near present day L'Enfant Plaza.
Benjamin Young's son Notley Rozier Young inherited the family property which included much of what is now Southwest DC. He married Eleanor Digges, and after his first wife's death, married Mary Carroll, sister of John Carroll, the first bishop in the United States. The property passed to his five children: Ann, Eleanor, Benjamin, Nicholas, and Notley Jr. In particular, Square 466, where St. Dominic Church was later built, passed to his namesake son, Rev. Notley Young, Jr. S.J., a professor of philosophy at neighboring Georgetown College, through whom the property passed to Georgetown College. In 1853, Dominicans purchased the parcel to build a parish from Georgetown for $5055.
Until the church was built, the Dominicans stayed with and said Mass at the residence of George Mattingly. The householder's grandfather, Robert E. Mattingly, a judge in the District of Columbia, recounted that "people attending would stand and kneel out into the street during the Mass." George Mattingly, originally of St. Mary's County, Maryland, was superintendent of the Norfolk Steamboat Company, and later donated the stained glass window of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. A further family connection to the Dominican order came when Nicholas Young married the sister of Rev. Edward Fenwick, O.P. who in 1805 founded the St. Joseph's Province, the first Dominican institution in the United States.
The church's southern entrance contains a relic of the first Catholic chapel built in Washington, D.C. This is an engraved dark sandstone which was the cornerstone of St. Mary's Chapel, a.k.a. "Barry's Chapel," built by James Barry (1755?–1808) and dedicated in 1806. Barry's Chapel stood at F &amp; 10th St SW under the present day Interstate 395 highway.
Founding.
St. Dominic Church was founded in 1852, organized by Rev. George A.J. Wilson, and opened on March 19, 1854. It was set in an area of the city known as "The Island" because, at that time, a canal ran where Constitution Ave. is today which connected the Potomac and the Anacostia Rivers.
As the congregation grew it was recognized that a new sanctuary was needed to hold all the congregants. This new church was dedicated on June 13, 1875 by Most Rev. James Roosevelt Bayley, Archbishop of Baltimore.
After President James A. Garfield was shot by Charles J. Guiteau on July 2, 1881, St. Dominic's joined other local churches in an "Appeal to Heaven" in praying for the president with Rev. Fr. Rochford delivering a sermon denouncing the assassination and praying for the recovery of the president.
On March 12, 1885, the interior of the church was destroyed in a fire.
Fire of 1885.
On March 12, 1885, the interior of the church was destroyed in a fire.[4][5] The fire broke out shortly after 10 A.M. in the boiler room on the west side of the church basement. It spread into the church above, eventually engulfing the altar. The church's engineer, Mr. Florence McCauliff, housekeeper Miss Kate Duffy, and Officer Burns of the nearby First Precinct Station House rushed to the sanctuary to save articles from the fire. They did not leave until they were driven out by the flames. Officer Burns sustained serious burn injuries to his hands and wrists, but the three were successful in removing everything of value from the altar.
The fire brigade succeeded in extinguishing the flames before the church was completely destroyed, but broke holes in the roof and stained glass windows in the process. Somber and tearful parishioners gathered outside the burning church. At 2 P.M., when the fire was finally extinguished, they walked into the ankle-deep water inside and carried out everything they could move. In all, the event caused an estimated $50,000 worth of damage to the church, including the total loss of a $2,000 organ and the destruction of a $1,000 stained glass window over the main entrance. Members of the local community—both Catholics and non-Catholics—banded together to raise funds, and rebuilt the church in a remarkably short period of time.
Urban Renewal.
Southwest Washington's population dropped by a quarter between 1920 and 1930 and the Federal government designated Southwest "blighted." In 1945, Congress established the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency (RLA) under the District of Columbia Redevelopment Act. Thus "urban renewal" began in Southwest Washington. Goldie Schneider, owner of a hardware store at 716 Fourth St, SW, challenged congressional authority to declared blighted areas eligible for demolition in "the public interest." Goldie's son Joseph H. Schneider, president of the Southwest Businessmen's Association, litigated the case all the way to the Supreme Court, but lost (Berman v. Parker). More than 4,000 families were displaced when their homes in Southwest Washington were demolished. At the time, the Most Rev. Philp Hannon, diocesan chancellor, and representative to the Federal City Council threatened legal action if St. Dominic Church was not appropriately compensated for confiscated property. U.S. Rep. Aime J. Forand (D-RI) introduced a bill to amend the parish's 1856 charter to allow the church's civil corporation to receive compensation at the contemporary value of the property, rather than the cap set at its charter written over a hundred years before.
The construction of Interstate I-395 and its 6th &amp; 7th Street ramps razed the St. Dominic Priory, School, and Convent.
Priory.
The old St. Dominic's convent was finished in the summer of 1880 and contained thirty-six rooms.
The old priory was at 515 Sixth St., SW. Following demolition of the original priory under the D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, the Dominican's leased a building at 439 Sixth St., SW. Finally in 1960 ground was broken to construct the present-day new chapel, and the four-story, forty-room residence including a center for assisted living for aged friars.
Historical lay communities.
Holy Name Society.
St. Dominic Church hosted a chapter of the Holy Name Society.
The Ladies Sodality of Our Lady.
St. Dominic Church hosted a chapter of the Ladies' Sodality.
Young Catholics’ Friend Society.
A philanthropic group known as the "Young Catholics' Friend Society" which funded free schools is mentioned in connection with the parish and diocese in news articles in the mid 19th century.
School.
A school existed in connection to St. Dominic's until the 1950s, when urban renewal began in much of Southwest D.C. The school sat where a section of Interstate 395 runs today. In 1948, during an era of widespread racial segregation, Patrick Cardinal O'Boyle, Archbishop of Washington directed the integration of all Catholic schools and activities. The last graduation was held in 1957 prior to the demolition of the school for urban renewal.
Lyndon Baines Johnson.
Lyndon B. Johnson occasionally visited St. Dominic’s during his tenure as President of the United States. His interest in the Catholic Church began when he was younger, and developed over time. He was sworn in as President on a Catholic Missal that had been owned by John F. Kennedy, because a Bible was not in the immediate area at the time of JFK's assassination. His daughter, Luci Baines Johnson, converted to the Catholic faith at age eighteen in preparation for her marriage at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.
LBJ would make frequent visits to St. Dominic's to pray and reflect with the friars, and Luci often asked her “Little Monks” to pray for the President during the Vietnam War. Though he received instruction to become a member of the Church from a friar, he never formally entered. He would maintain an interest in the faith through the rest of his life and would have a Catholic service said at his graveside.
Community.
Lay discipleship communities.
Dominican Third Order.
St. Dominic Church hosts a chapter of the Dominican Third Order which meets monthly to the present day.
Saint Dominic Young Adults.
St. Dominic's Young Adults, a young adult discipleship group begun on the feast of St. Thérèse of Lisieux 2015, continues to the present day.
St. Dominic Cenacle.
St. Dominic Cenacle, an adult discipleship group begun in 2017, continues to the present day.
Knights of Columbus.
The Knights of Columbus are a Catholic-based Fraternal Organization engaged in charity both local and global in scope, Life Insurance, and faith-based institutional investing. Two chapters of the organization meet at St. Dominic Church presently:
The church is engaged in a variety of local social and service activities including So Others Might Eat, visitation of the sick and homebound, and The Proverbs 24 Community (P24).
Art and music.
The current reredos was installed in 2013.
A tabernacle from Belgium was installed around 2011.
The ornately carved wooden altar was a gift of L. Kevin and Anne Lynch in memory of Rev. Francis Hyacinth Roth, O.P. (1899-1985) who was ordained at St. Dominic Church in 1938 and served in Boyce, Louisiana according to a memorial plaque.
Architecture.
The architect of the church was Mr. Patrick C. Keely.
Stained Glass.
Some of the stained glass windows in the sanctuary date back to 1875, when the church was constructed. The central window above the main altar depicts the Sacred Heart of Christ. It is immediately flanked by a window of the Blessed Virgin Mary and another of Saint Joseph, the latter of which was a gift of Ellen Ewing Sherman, wife of General William Tecumseh Sherman, and mother of Thomas Ewing Sherman, S.J. The sanctuary further has two windows depicting Saints Dominic and Thomas Aquinas, respectively.
Besides the sanctuary windows, others also date to 1875, including a large rose window portraying St. Cecilia, as well as windows depicting St. Peter, St. Paul, and Dominican shields. However, the majority of the church's stained glass windows were installed in 1965 and created by the Heimer company. The windows depict scenes from the life of St. Dominic and other Dominican saints.
The Hilborne Roosevelt Organ.

Nina Teicholz

Nina Teicholz is a journalist who became an advocate opposed to the mainstream nutritional principle that saturated fat is unhealthy and should be minimized in the American diet.
Education and early life.
Nina Teicholz grew up in North Berkeley, California.
She earned a degree in American Studies at Stanford University, and completed her master's in Latin American Studies at Oxford University.
Career.
Teicholz worked as a reporter for National Public Radio and became a freelancer, contributing to publications including "The New York Times", "The Washington Post", "Gourmet", "The New Yorker", "The Economist", "Salon", and "Men's Health".
She said that she became interested in dietary fats while doing a series of stories investigating food for "Gourmet", and was assigned a story on trans fat that was published in 2004. Her 2014 book, "The Big Fat Surprise: Why Butter, Meat and Cheese Belong in a Healthy Diet," traced the history of US diet guidelines; in the book she discussed the science behind the guidelines and the influence of industry lobbying on them, and also questioned the emphasis on avoiding saturated fat. She advised readers to "eat butter; drink milk whole, and feed it to the whole family. Stock up on creamy cheeses, offal, and sausage, and yes, bacon". The book made "The New York Times" Best Seller list that year, and was named one of the Top 10 Non-Fiction Books of 2014 by "The Wall Street Journal" and one of the year's best science books by "The Economist". The book was criticized by nutritionists including Marion Nestle.
Teicholz authored an opinion piece with similar themes in "The Wall Street Journal" in October 2014 that caught the attention of hedge fund founder John Arnold, who recruited her to join the efforts funded through his Laura and John Arnold Foundation to fight obesity, namely through the Nutrition Science Initiative, which does research, the Action Now Initiative, a lobbying group, and the Nutrition Coalition, which is aimed at improving dietary guidelines.
In February 2015, the US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) released its report, written to provide a foundation for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and "The New York Times" published an op-ed by Teicholz criticizing the committee and its work. The Arnold Foundation funded further work by Teicholz on the DGAC report, which was published in the "British Medical Journal" in September 2015. In that article, Teicholz continued the themes of her book and her February op-ed, and wrote that the DGAC showed bias against fat and meat and did not use all the available evidence, and that members had undisclosed conflicts of interest. The "BMJ" circulated a preprint of the article with a press release, and Teicholz' claims were widely covered in the media.
Teicholz' claims were harshly criticized by the DGAC, the US Department of Health and Human Services, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and others, including a petition signed by 180 scientists, and they called for the "BMJ" to retract the article or issue corrections. The "BMJ" issued a correction in October 2015 and another in December 2016, the latter with a statement that after an independent review of the paper, it had decided not to retract it.
Meanwhile, the Arnold Foundation had been pressing for Congressional hearings about the DGAC report and attempted to block the release of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans; its lobbying group arranged meetings for Teicholz with members of Congress and White House staff. Teicholz and the Foundation were criticized at the time for being allies of the meat and dairy industries in their lobbying and other public relations efforts to maintain high levels of meat and dairy consumption by US consumers.
Teicholz' advocacy has been criticized by Marion Nestle for making strong claims about the benefits of a low carb, high fat diet that go beyond what the science can support; Nestle wrote of Teicholz' advocacy: "It does little to foster the health of the public to make nutrition science appear more controversial than it really is."
Teicholz is an advocate of beef consumption. Beef industry leader Amanda Radke has written in "Beef Daily" that "Today's best beef advocates wear a variety of hats [...] like Nina Teicholz or Gary Taubes who turn against conventional health advice to promote diets rich in animal fats and proteins".
In 2017, Salim Yusuf stated that Teicholz "shook up the nutrition world but she got it right", a statement for which he was immediately and broadly criticized, as he had been for prior statements outside the mainstream of nutrition science.

Prostitution in the Crown dependencies

Crown dependencies are independently administered jurisdictions which do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered "territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible", rather than sovereign states. 
Bailiwick of Guernsey.
Prostitution in Guernsey is legal, but related activities such as solicitation and brothel keeping are prohibited.
History.
At the end of the 19th century prostitution was common in Guernsey, especially in St Peter Port where around 500 soldiers were garrisoned. A large number of the prostitutes were French. The military authorities were concerned about the high rate of STIs amongst the soldiers.
The "Committee of the Council for the Affairs of Guernsey and Jersey" reported in 1897: 
 "Secret Diseases, not unfrequently [sic] introduced by foreign prostitutes would appear to be prevalent in that Island [ie Guernsey] . . . such diseases sap the foundation of public health and affect injuriously not only those who by their own misconduct have incurred them, but even generations yet unborn . . ."
This report eventually led to the passing of "la Loi Rélative aux Maladies Secrètes" in 1912. This law provided for compulsory medical examination and detention in hospital if infected, and also the expulsion of foreign prostitutes. This law was repealed by The Venereal Diseases Ordinance (1912) Repeal Ordinance, 1949. However, due to the wording of the 1949 act, the 1912 law is arguably still in force in Alderney.
In 2005 an East European prostitution ring was thought to be operating on the island.
Bailiwick of Jersey.
Prostitution in Jersey is legal, but related activities such as keeping a brothel are outlawed. Following a consultation period from 1 September 2017 and 13 October 2017, the Home Affairs Minister approved a new draft Sexual Offences (Jersey) Law to be debated in the Assembly of the States of Jersey. The draft law does not criminalise prostitution, but consolidates previous legislation on related activities.
In 2015 it was estimated there were 35–40 prostitutes in Jersey. Most visit the island for short periods and work from hotels.
History.
In the 19th century, prostitution was common. French women came over to the island to service the needs of the soldiers stationed on the island and sailors in the port. The road that led from the barracks to the port, Pier Road, had many brothels and, after dark, women solicited in the road. In 1846, George Le Cronier, the Centenier of Saint Helier, decided to clean up the island. He visited one of the houses of ill-repute, "Mulberry Cottage" on Patriotic Street, and arrested 11 prostitutes who worked there. The following week he returned to the house with the intent of arresting the master and mistress of the house. On entering the house he was stabbed in the stomach by the mistress Marie Le Gendre. Le Cronier died the next day and Le Gendre transported to Australia for life.
At the end of the 19th century, police would accompany gentlemen to brothels and, for a fee, ensure no legal action was taken against them. Prostitutes were using hotels and restaurants to find customers by 1910. In the 1930s, Sand Street was where street prostitutes worked and there was a well known brothel, the "Striped Monkey", on Cross Street.
During the German occupation of the island in 1940, all sexual contact between the German soldiers and the islanders was prohibited. To stop any "illegal" prostitution, the German authorities set up a brothel in the "Maison de Victor Hugo" hotel. Syphilis was a problem amongst the soldiers and a specialist clinic was set up in the "Merton Hotel".
Isle of Man.
Prostitution in the Isle of Man is legal but related activities such as soliciting, procuring and brothel keeping are prohibited by the Sexual Offences Act 1992.
There are few prostitutes permanently on the Isle of Man, most visiting the island on short term "tours". A man and a woman were arrested on suspicion of committing prostitution offences in Douglas in 2013. A police spokesman said this was "an unusual and rare incident."

Oak Grove Power Plant

Oak Grove Power Plant is a 1.79-gigawatt (1,796 MW), coal power plant located north of Franklin, Texas in Robertson County, Texas. The plant is operated by Luminant, a subsidiary of Vistra Energy. It began operations in 2010.
History.
Plans for Oak Grove began in the 1970s as Texas Power &amp; Light (a forerunner of Luminant) and Alcoa made an agreement to jointly operate a power plant named Twin Oak Steam Electric Station in Robertson County. The plan was to construct two, 750 MW units to burn lignite and be ready for commercial generation by 1981. The electricity generated would run to Alcoa's aluminium smelting facility in Palestine, Texas. Twin Oaks Reservoir was developed by impounding Duck Creek in 1982 to act as a cooling source for the plant. In 1983, Alcoa attempted to sell its stake in Twin Oak to Halliburton who was seeking electricity to offer to the owners of the troubled South Texas Nuclear Generating Station. Ultimately, Alcoa sold its stake back to Texas Utilities in 1984. As electricity demand in Texas stagnated, construction on Twin Oak continued to be deferred until the air permit was withdrawn in 1994.
The plant was renamed from Twin Oak to Oak Grove when construction restarted in 2007 by Luminant. Construction resumed in order to meet future electricity demand and following the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) granting Luminant a new air permit for Oak Grove. The plant was reconfigured and redesigned to meet current emissions requirements. This included the addition of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems to reduce nitrogen oxide () emissions and activated carbon which prevents mercury from being released. After Fluor completed the necessary construction work, Unit 1 came online in December 2009 and Unit 2 came online in June 2010. Oak Grove utilizes lignite exacted from the nearby Kosse Mine.

First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane

First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane is a heritage-listed site at 273 North Quay, Brisbane City, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Lucas and Cummings, Architects. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 2016.
History.
The First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane (1940) is a two-storey masonry building located on the western end of North Quay in the Brisbane central business district (CBD). Erected as the result of the growth of the church in the first half of the 20th century, it continues to serve the needs of its congregation. Designed by noted Brisbane firm Lucas and Cummings, Architects, the building is an excellent, intact example of their work and of modernist design. In 1950, the church was awarded the "Medal for Meritorious Architecture for Institutional Buildings erected in Brisbane between 1940 and 1949" by the Queensland Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA).
During the 19th century, North Quay, running along a ridge beside the Brisbane River from Victoria Bridge (Queen Street) to the River Road (known as Coronation Drive from 1937), was a mixed commercial and residential area including a number of elite houses. Along its course were the Supreme Court Building (between Adelaide and Ann Streets); commercial buildings (Smith's Building - later Longreach Hotel - on the corner of Queen Street and North Quay, 1877-8; Helidon Spa Co building, between Skew Street and Eagle Terrace, removed 1897; Rankin &amp; Morrow Biscuit Factory, 1896); and villas, houses and "cottages", primarily on its western extent.
The area transitioned from predominantly residential use to government, commercial and institutional uses commencing around the turn of the century. Aubigny (originally Rosalie Villa, 259 North Quay) and William Douglas Grimes' house (269 North Quay) were leased by the Queensland Government 1900-1904, then were occupied by the first Mater Hospital 1906-10, and subsequently became Loretto Hostel for Catholic girls. Large residences such as Riversleigh and Davidson's House were converted into boarding houses; and new boarding houses were constructed. Later, houses were converted into flats. In the 1920s the construction of the Grey Street Bridge, a major river crossing into the CBD from West End, brought land resumptions and road changes to the western end of North Quay, to facilitate traffic flow on and off the bridge.
The interwar period was a time of enormous transformation of Brisbane's CBD despite economic downturn in the immediate post-World War I years and the Great Depression from 1929 into the 1930s. A building boom between 1922 and 1928 and a wave of building activity from the mid- to late 1930s created new landmark buildings, extended and remodelled existing premises and spread business houses and warehouses into residential areas.
The development of the North Quay site of the First Church of Christ, Scientist reflected this transformative trend, when, in 1939, two allotments on North Quay, both with substantial residences, were purchased for the site of its future church.
Christian Science is a Christian denomination which places a strong emphasis on the Bible's teachings for healing purposes. The Church of Christ, Scientist was founded in Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America in 1879 by influential American author, teacher and religious leader, Mary Baker Eddy, who is noted for her groundbreaking ideas about spirituality and health, which she named Christian Science.
The church has no clergy and each branch is self-governing and elects its own officers, but complies with the Church Manual of "The Mother Church" in Boston. An informal group of Christian Scientists can form into a Christian Science society or Church of Christ, Scientist, both of which are known as branches of The Mother Church. The society or church must comprise "at least 16 loyal Christian Scientists, four of whom are members of The Mother Church, and at least one member is a Christian Science practitioner" (listed in The Christian Science Journal).
Every Church of Christ, Scientist conducts Sunday services, testimony meetings, a Sunday School for pupils up to age 20, operates a reading room where information about Christian Science is available to the public, and organises lectures by Christian Science lecturers. Church services are conducted by two readers. These functions of the Church of Christ, Scientist determine the form of its church buildings.
Interest in Christian Science teachings started in several Australian colonies during the 1890s. The earliest recorded meetings began in Melbourne in June 1898 while several people met in the Brisbane home of Mrs Eliza Caroline Dutton before September 1899.
In February 1901, meetings were held in Mrs Helen Scott Byrne's home, Richmond Villa in Upper Roma Street, Brisbane; initially as a Christian Science organisation but soon afterwards as the Christian Science Society. Mrs Byrne's home became too small for services when attendees reached about 20, so the fledgling Society moved to the first floor of the Edwards Building in Adelaide Street at Petrie Bight, which could accommodate up to 100 people for services in its large room and had a smaller room for a reading room. In December 1901 the Christian Science Society formed itself into the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane with Mrs Byrne as the First Reader and Mr J H Granger as the Second Reader. Within less than a year, there were about 60 people attending services.
By 1909 the Petrie Bight location was inadequate, so the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane took over a floor in the Brisbane Permanent Building and Banking Co Ltd's premises at 139 Adelaide Street, between Edward and Albert Streets. In 1915, the Church of Christ, Scientist was incorporated under the Religious, Education and Charitable Institutions Act, 1861 in Queensland.
In 1917, the church purchased a block of land at the corner of North Quay and Tank Street for a church building designed by Thomas Wightman. The cornerstone of the First Church of Christ Scientist, Brisbane building was laid and stage one of the 300-seat building erected later that year.
Throughout the 1920s the Christian Science movement expanded, with new branches and bigger churches opening, especially in suburban Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne, as well as new groups meeting outside capital cities.
By 1930 the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane had outgrown its North Quay building, so Centennial Hall at 104 Adelaide Street was purchased for £16,500 and converted to accommodate 1000 people for services, while the Sunday School was held in a nearby cafe.
Due to growth of the Christian Science movement in Brisbane, the Second Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane formed, centred on the suburb of Clayfield. It built a church building in 1938 at Vine Street, Clayfield. This modernist building was designed by Robert Percy Cummings to suit the triangular site and to meet the particular spatial needs of the congregation.
By the late 1930s the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane again needed a larger church for its purposes. It purchased two allotments on North Quay to the west of its earlier site in (the Grimes' house, which was part of Loretto Hostel) and in March 1939 (Crossen-an-Oder). By April 1939 the house on the Loretto site was sold at public auction for removal.
The planning and architectural expression of Christian Science church edifices has been the subject of considerable discourse since the Mother Church in Boston was completed in the mid-1890s. Autonomy in the choice of architectural design and the departure from long accepted church types was supported by the Christian Science movement from the outset. In its formative years, and in contrast to orthodox churches, the Church of Christ Scientist adopted a Neo-Classical expression. By the early 20th century, Christian Science churches were increasingly inventive and eclectic. Excellence in design and construction and the use of high quality materials were common to all. Increasingly the principles of Modernism were adopted to create distinctive places of worship where the architectural form developed from the planning and practical requirements of the Church.
Early examples of this evolution in design include the 1910 First Church in Berkeley, California designed by renowned architect Bernard Maybeck. Other outstanding examples, in the UK and Europe, include the First Church (1903) in Manchester England, an Arts and Crafts design by Edgar Wood; the First Church in The Hague, a modernist design by Hendrik Berlage (1925); Salvisberg's First Church (1936) in Basel, and Hans Hofmann's First Church (1938) in Zurich.
The development of Christian Science church architecture in Australia closely mirrored its overseas counterparts. Eminent architects were selected to produce high quality buildings with characteristic operational and functional features. In the first two decades of the 20th century, Neo-Classical designs were preferred. Melbourne's First Church in St Kilda, designed in 1914 by Harold Dumsday of Bates, Peebles and Smart, and completed in 1922, has a temple-like form, Greek Revival elements and Byzantine influences. Sydney's First Church, opened in 1927 in Darlinghurst, was built in a Beaux Art style and is a major work by Samuel George Thorp, one of the founding partners of Peddle Thorp Walker.
By the 1930s, a Modern aesthetic was being adopted in response to a growing global interest in Modernism, a movement in architecture that emerged in Europe in the 1920s. Modernism embraced the ideals of Functionalism, new technologies and the rejection of ornament in an endeavour to create new and appropriate architectural solutions that reflected the social conditions of the time. Characteristics of the architecture these ideas produced included asymmetrical massing, simple geometric shapes, clean lines, steel-framed corner and strip windows, undecorated brick walls, flat cantilevered concrete awnings and low-pitched or flat roofs concealed behind parapets. One of the first examples of modernist architecture in Queensland was the Masel Residence in Stanthorpe, designed by Charles Fulton in 1936. It received wide publicity and architectural acclaim and introduced many features of this new and influential architectural vocabulary to Queensland. Modern architecture symbolised progress, innovation, efficiency and economy, qualities that made it appealing in the post-depression era.
Bates Smart McCutcheon designed the 1937 Moderne-Classical Second Church of Christ Scientist in Camberwell, which is strikingly similar to the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane. In Perth, the First Church of Christ Scientist, an Art Deco building, was designed by the well-known architectural firm Ochiltree and Hargrave and is one of the most notable public buildings in Western Australia from the interwar period. In Adelaide, foundations were laid in 1916 for their First Church designed by Woods, Laybourne Smith architects, but this building was not completed until 1957.
As the wide-ranging architectural expression of the Christian Science movement developed around the globe, there were operational and performance characteristics common to all, with several marked departures from the planning of orthodox churches and cathedrals. To allow all members of the congregation to hear the sermon and see the rostrum, a broader nave with much narrower aisles became necessary. Domes that interfered with acoustics were phased out; and a much larger foyer for congregating after services was required.
The buildings, no matter how their exteriors were expressed, were functional and innovative, and adopted advanced acoustics, lighting and state of the art ventilation systems. A stately appearance was important and entrances porches were frequently made of fine materials such as marble or terracotta with three or five entrance doors. Interiors were skilfully composed, efficient, restful, and well-lit. The substitution of established ecclesiastical symbols with plants and flowers added to the creation of a comfortable environment. 
Good acoustics were paramount, as auditoriums were for listening and speaking, and contributed to the comfort of service attendees. Churches also needed to be well insulated from outside noise and shaped to complement this aspect of services. A large portion of the Sunday services consisted of reading from a dual pulpit in fixed positions, another aspect that church designers had to take into consideration. Sunday School involved opening and closing exercises, with the Sunday School superintendent standing on a raised platform followed by instruction given in rooms or alcoves around the perimeter, and reassembly in the centre of the main room at the end of the teaching period.
The First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane in its current location on North Quay opened on 4 August 1940 with three special services during the day. The cost of the building was about £20,000. At this time it was described as follows:A site of unusual shape has dictated the unorthodox plan adopted by the architects (Messrs FB Lucas and RP Cummings) in order to provide for the main activities of the church organisation. The imposing entrance from North Quay opens onto the main foyer from which all important sections of the building as accessible.The church auditorium is entered from one side of the foyer. A fan-shaped auditorium has been used for three reasons. Firstly, it provides good acoustical conditions and assists in the uniform distribution of sound. Secondly, it gives...[a] seating arrangement suitable for testimony meetings and lastly it fits well on the unusual site. Readers' rooms etc are situated beyond the platform end of the auditorium and have a separate entrance from the side of the church. They are connected to the main entrance by a corridor along the side of the auditorium The corridor also acts as a sound shield to the main body of the building.At the end of the foyer, opposite the main entrance is a small suite of rooms for men ushers and [the] Love Committee (relief). Also a secondary entrance and ramp from May Street at the rear of the site. A large cloakroom with a broad counter is served directly from the main foyer.The Sunday School is placed on the opposite side of the main foyer to the auditorium, mainly in order to avoid any possibility of interference by sound transmission from one area to the other during services. It may be entered from the main foyer but the principal entrance is from outside, close to the main church entrance. Individual class rooms, superintendents and other rooms open off the Sunday School room. Entry [is] from the main foyer to a stair hall giving access the ladies' room, administrative entrance, literature counter and a small rest room.The staircase ascends to suite of committee rooms, literature distribution room and the caretaker's flat, all over the Sunday School; and to the administrative section comprising boardroom, clerk's room and treasurer's room over the main entrance to the building.A dignified exterior relies for its effect on the well-proportioned main masses of the building and suitable treatment of detail. Walls are finished in cream brick and the main entrance emphasised by a colonnade treatment in artificial stone.Internally a feeling of space and restfulness is gained by handling of large surfaces of colour in light tones. The auditorium walls are panelled eight feet high with [solid vertical boards] of silver silkwood. The timber pews of special design are in similar material.The auditorium is ventilated by a forced draught system of filtered air... diffused artificial lighting is employed in the auditoriumThe pipe organ ... built by BB Whitehouse and Co Ltd [local organ-makers], is housed above the readers' platform behind a wide grille, while the console is to the side of the platform in a well, out of sight of the congregation.Queensland timbers and materials are featured... [Most] materials and labour are of Queensland origin.The new building also incorporated the cornerstone of the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane's earlier church on the corner of Tank Street and North Quay.
Architects Frederick Bruce Lucas and Robert Percy Cummings were key figures in architecture in Queensland before and after World War II and had an affinity with the Modern movement. Their works were characterised by meticulous detailing and thoroughness in execution. These characteristics made them well-suited to be the architects for the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane. Cummings had previously designed the Second Church of Christ, Scientist at Clayfield, a commission he may have received due to connections to Christian Science through his mother-in-law. For the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane commission, Cummings was responsible for the design and Lucas was responsible for the working drawings and contract documents. Cummings' architectural training at the Architectural Association in London and subsequent travels provided him with the opportunity to study the work of European architects such as the Scandinavians and Dutch. He had a particular interest in and affinity with the work of Dutch modernist architect Willem Dudok.
Lucas and Cummings made a significant contribution to the architectural profession, devoting a major part of their careers to its advancement through architectural education (notably as foundation staff of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Queensland); as office bearers in the Royal Australian Institute of Architects; and to increasing public awareness of architecture, urban design and art in Queensland. Brought into close contact through this work they set up practice in 1936. Despite limited opportunities to practice architecture in the 1930s-40s due to the Great Depression, World War II and post-war shortages, Lucas and Cummings produced a number of innovative projects. Individually and as partners they designed a small number of important buildings, some of which received awards for excellence in design and which were influential in the development of the post-war vernacular in Queensland.
In 1950 the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane was awarded the "Medal for Meritorious Architecture for Institutional Buildings erected in Brisbane between 1940 and 1949", by the council of the Queensland Chapter of the RAIA. Since then, the building has been identified as being of cultural heritage significance by the study entitled "Significant 20th Century Architecture, Queensland" in 1988; was entered in the Brisbane City Council Heritage Register; and in 2010 was included in a draft list of nationally significant places formulated by an Australian Institute of Architects National Heritage Taskforce. It is also included in the Australian Heritage Places Inventory. In 2010 and 2011, the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane participated in the Brisbane Open House event.
The building is notably intact, a testament to its skilful design and execution and meticulous attention to detail. Only minor changes have been implemented in over 70 years of use as a Christian Science church. On the ground floor, the former cloak room has been adapted as a children's nursery; the book room/reading room is now used as the clerk's office; and the rooflight in the main foyer is now artificially lit. On the first floor, the caretaker's accommodation is no longer used for its original purpose, but for storage. The roof sheeting has been replaced and toilet suites on the ground floor have been upgraded. Glazing in many of the south-facing windows, damaged in a 2014 storm, has been replaced. Artificial stone cladding to the entrance columns has been painted.
In 2016, the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane remains the largest Christian Science church in Queensland. The building continues to fulfil its purpose of providing a place of worship by Christian Scientists where Christian Science services, testimonials, Sunday School classes and lectures continue to be conducted.
Description.
Approached from North Quay with secondary access from May Street, the First Church of Christ, Scientist, Brisbane is located at the western end of Brisbane's central business district overlooking the Brisbane River between the William Jolly Bridge and the Kurilpa Bridge. Its careful composition of simple, cubic volumes of one and two storeys, enveloped in buff-coloured brickwork with concrete parapets and continuous window hoods derives from its unconventional floor plan, which fits inside the boundaries of its irregular shaped allotment. The boundaries are defined by low brick retaining walls. In response both to its siting on a busy thoroughfare and to the introspective nature required of its interior, its limited fenestration to North Quay gives the building an introverted appearance. The building's intactness is testament to the exceptional quality of its design and execution.
Elevated from North Quay and accessed by a short flight of wide stairs, the main entrance to the Church is a simple, dignified triple-fronted portico lined with artificial stone. Through three pairs of tall timber entrance doors set within a bronze frame with banks of fanlights above, another short flight of stairs leads to the generous foyer from which are accessible the auditorium to the west and the Sunday School, former book room and rest room (now the clerk's office), former cloak room (now a children's nursery), rooms for ladies' ushers and the stair hall to the east. The secondary entrance with ramp from May Street, together with rooms for male ushers are located at the opposite end of the foyer to the main entrance. An office (former clerk's office), boardroom, committee rooms and a self-contained flat are located on the first floor.
Auditorium.
The building's principal space, the auditorium, is restrained, elegantly proportioned and light-filled. A large volume, it has symmetrically arranged tall, high level windows set in lightly coloured, rendered walls above a perimeter wall lining of Queensland Maple panels. Devoid of applied decoration, its beauty is derived from its pleasing proportions and the high quality and finish of its materials, fixings and fixtures. Its fan-shaped plan and sloping floor direct focus to the readers' platform at the front of the room, and together with acoustic panels located on the rear wall, aid acoustics. The elevated readers' platform has dual pulpits and, in metal relief lettering, high on the walls to each side, are brief biblical quotations. An attachable additional platform, used for meetings, is located in the underfloor area. To the north (right) of the platform, the Whitehouse Brothers organ is located in an organ pit, the rear of which is accessible from an organ room to the west, which has external access for ease of maintenance. The organ pipework is concealed behind the perforated screen above the readers' platform. Auditorium seating comprises five banks of pews separated by narrow side, centre and transverse aisles; each pew graduating in length in response to the irregular floor plan.
An inventive feature that is in working order is the mechanical ventilation system. Timber registers, located within the timber wall panels and carefully centred under each of the windows, draw air up through the walls from the plenum system located in the basement, which is then expelled through the ventilated ceiling beams and louvres in the eastern wall.
Beyond the readers' platform is a secondary entrance from North Quay for readers, readers' rooms and rooms for the soloist, organist, flowers and ancillary facilities. A passage running the length of the auditorium between the main and readers' entrances provide an effective acoustic buffer from North Quay.
Sunday School.
Located on the eastern side of the foyer and accessible from it, is the Sunday School. Its main entrance is centred in the southern wall, accessible along a short path from North Quay. The Sunday School has a generously proportioned hall with three classrooms on the northern side, girls' and boys' toilets on the southern side, either side of the entrance and a platform for the superintendent on the eastern end. Behind this platform are the superintendent's room and the library.
First Floor.
The stair hall leads to the first floor where are located a suite of committee and literature distribution rooms and the caretaker's flat located above the Sunday School. An administrative area, located above the main entrance and foyer, contains the boardroom, clerk's room and treasurer's room.
Details.
All architectural details are well finished and include steel framed windows and balustrades; terrazzo window sills, toilet partitions and floors in the entrance lobby, stairs, stair hall and bathrooms. Original fittings, fixtures, furniture and signage are retained throughout the building. Internal walls throughout are rendered and painted in a limited palette of light colours.

2018 Dervish protests

The 2018 Dervish protests were a series of protests by the Iranian Dervishes, who are members of Sufi Islam, in Tehran, Iran. The protests started on 4 February, and calmed down the next day. However, protests flared up again on 19 February, where 3 members of the security forces were killed after being run over by a bus.
Background.
The Gonabadi Dervishes are Sufi Muslims; the Iranian government considers them a threat. Conversion to Sufism is frowned upon by the Shi'a religious establishment.
In January 2012, at least 10 of the group's members were imprisoned in Fars province, and others may be held at Evin Prison in Tehran, including Kasra Nouri
Protests.
On 19 February, the Sufis organized a sit-in protest at a police station, located in the Pasdaran district of Tehran, where one of their members was held. Later, clashes broke out between the Sufi protestors and security forces. Police used tear gas in an attempt to disperse the protesters. Five riot police were killed. 
According to the Iranian press, police arrested around 300 people, and there have been reports that some of the protesters may have been killed. However, the Sufi dervishes gathered around the home of their 90-year-old leader Noor Ali Tabandeh to protect him from arrest. 
In the aftermath of the 19 February, protests, footage emerged that showed several Sufi protesters who were arrested, being tortured by government forces.
On 4 March, it was revealed that one of the protesters had died under the custody of the Iranian government.

Crystal LaBeija

Crystal LaBeija was an African American Manhattan trans woman who founded the House of LaBeija in 1977. The House is often credited as starting the house system in ball culture. She became a mother figure for homeless LGBTQ youth; giving love, support, relief, and confidence for the ballroom and the outside world.
Career.
LaBeija originally worked and competed on the Manhattan drag circuit under the name of Crystal LaAsia, before changing her name to LaBeija as Latin queens kept calling her "La Belleza" (Spanish for "the beauty"). In the 1960s and 1970s, drag queens of color were expected to whiten their appearance to help their chances at winning competitions and they often faced racist environments. LaBeija was one of only a few African American drag queens to be awarded a "Queen of the Ball" title at a drag ball organized by whites during this era. In 1967, she was crowned Miss Manhattan.
LaBeija subsequently competed in the 1967 Miss All-America Camp Beauty Pageant held in New York City Town Hall, a competition documented in "The Queen" (1968). In a scene towards the end of the documentary, LaBeija, upset with the perceived racism of the white-run balls, accused the pageant organizer Flawless Sabrina of rigging the judging in the favor of a white queen, Rachel Harlow.
Refusing to participate further in a discriminatory system, LaBeija worked with another Black drag queen, Lottie LaBeija, to host a ball just for Black queens. She agreed to participate in the event so long as she was highlighted in the ball. This event, the first to be hosted by a House, was titled "Crystal &amp; Lottie LaBeija presents the first annual House of Labeija Ball at Up the Downstairs Case on West 115th Street &amp; 5th Avenue in Harlem, NY" and took place in 1972. It was the first time the term "House" was used, coined by LaBeija in order to market the event, which would be a huge success.
LaBeija continued to work as a drag performer and activist throughout the 1970s and 1980s. RuPaul's first experience of a drag performance was seeing LaBeija perform a lipsync routine at a nightclub in Atlanta in 1979.
in 2019, Rolling Stone reported that LaBeija died of liver failure in 1982. However, the New York Times reported in 1993 that Labeija was still alive and had attended a revival of "The Queen" at the Film Forum in New York. The article reported that LaBeija was still "a fixture in the drag world" and had a reunion of sorts with contest winner Harlow. "She was very very lovely to me," Harlow is quoted as saying. "She came up to me and kissed me and said hello... [S]he left before the end."

Maung Nu massacre

The Maung Nu massacre was a mass-killing of Rohingya people by the Myanmar Army that reportedly happened in the village of Maung Nu (also known as Monu Para), in Rakhine State, Myanmar on 27 August 2017. In February 2018, video evidence emerged allegedly showing government-contracted workers bulldozing parts of Maung Nu, with visible body bags and corpses in the footage.
Background.
The Rohingya people are an ethnic minority that mainly live in the northern region of Rakhine State, Myanmar, and have been described as one of the world's most persecuted minorities. In modern times, the persecution of Rohingyas in Myanmar dates back to the 1970s. Since then, Rohingya people have regularly been made the target of persecution by the government and nationalist Buddhists. The tension between various religious groups in the country had often been exploited by the past military governments of Myanmar. According to Amnesty International, the Rohingya have suffered from human rights violations under past military dictatorships since 1978, and many have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh as a result. In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees had assisted with the repatriation of Rohingyas from Bangladesh, but allegations of human rights abuses in the refugee camps threatened this effort. In 2015, 140,000 Rohingyas remained in IDP camps after communal riots in 2012.
On 25 August 2017, insurgents of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) launched their second large-scale attack on the Myanmar Army, leading to new "clearance operations" by the government, which critics argue targeted civilians. Many Rohingyas sought refuge at Maung Nu, after fleeing neighbouring villages upon hearing gunfire.
Massacre.
At around 11:00 AM on 27 August 2017, dozens of Myanmar Army soldiers from Battalion 564 arrived in Maung Nu, prompting most of the Rohingya villagers to hide in their homes. According to 37 alleged survivors of the massacre, a soldier demanded that the villagers come outside, and when nobody did the soldiers opened fire on the homes. Soldier then stormed into the homes, looting valuables, assaulting women, and detaining men and boys. Some of the men detained were allegedly executed afterwards on the order of the commanding officer.

Stormin

Shaun Lewis (15 February 1984 – 19 February 2018), better known by the stage names Stormin and Teddy Bruckshot, was a pioneering grime and drum and bass MC from Plaistow, London.
Music.
At the age of 13, Shaun began making a name for himself locally by participating in workshops within the London Borough of Newham at youth centres across the district. Stormin participated in a jungle rave called 'Kool Skool', wherein MC's from all around London would clash on stage, with the winner taking home £100 and a slot on Kool FM. After that, his name got around and Stormin was able to circuit various radio stations across London. After making waves across the numerous pirate radio stations, he co-founded Nasty Crew alongside Marcus Nasty and Sharky Major. The crew went on to recruit MCs such as Kano, D Double E, and Jammer.
His versatility and ability to MC across a range of different tempos earned him praise amongst his peers and listeners alike. As one of the earliest MC's to take UK garage instrumentals and use dark lyrics similar to US influenced hip hop it was this sound which saw the birth of grime. Early affiliates included Dizzee Rascal with whom he recorded one of his first ever tracks. In later years he was part of a group of jump-up MCs called SaSaSaS and also worked under an anonymous and masked alias Teddy Bruckshot inspired by Louie Rankin's character in the 2002 movie release Shottas releasing on labels such as Deep Medi Musik. Stormin won awards for Best DnB Group (with SaSaSaS) and 3 x Best Crowd Hype DnB MC in 2016, 2017 and posthumously at the 2018 Drum and Bass Awards.
Illness and death.
At 16 years old Shaun was diagnosed with lupus, which as a result left him with red patches on various parts of his face.
He was hospitalised with skin cancer in 2016 but was declared cancer-free later that same year. The cancer returned early in 2018 and he died in a hospice about a month later.
After his death, artists and fans mourned throughout social media including Skepta, Dizzee Rascal, Example and Rag N' Bone Man explaining the difference he had made to the UK underground music scene. The hashtag #BussIt, named for his 2015 single, trended on multiple social media platforms following his death along with #Stormin.
Personal life.
Stormin was of Jamaican descent, with family from Clarendon.

Renfrew Leslie Christie (born 1949) is a South African scholar and member of the Anti-Apartheid Movement whose covert operations for uMkhonto we Sizwe, the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress, provided intelligence that made possible the 1982 bombing of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station. Christie was arrested, tortured, and sentenced to 10 years in prison under the Terrorism Act, 1967 for giving information on the nuclear programme of South Africa to the ANC. His actions were intended to thwart the Apartheid regime of South Africa and weapons of mass destruction, specifically the government's clandestine nuclear arsenal. Christie was released in 1986 after accepting P.W. Botha's offer of freedom in exchange for his renunciation of political violence. After the fall of Apartheid, Christie resumed his academic career at the University of the Western Cape. When asked by the BBC 30 years later if he was proud to have spied for the ANC, Christie said, "Absolutely. I was working for Nelson Mandela's military force, the uMkhonto we Sizwe. I'm very proud of that. We won. We got a democracy. We got a bill of rights. We got a constitutional court. It worked."

Philip L. Cantelon

Philip Luis Cantelon (born 1940) is the co-founder and CEO of History Associates Incorporated and a leading pioneer in the field of applied history. He previously taught contemporary American history at Williams College, and is a founding member of the National Council on Public History and the Society for History in the Federal Government. Cantelon is an expert on oral history, foundations, business and institutional history, as well as the history of deregulation.
Early Life and education.
Cantelon is a historian who has worked in both academia and applied history. He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1962 with a degree in history and subsequently earned a MA at the University of Michigan in 1963. He received his PhD from Indiana University Bloomington in 1971.
Career.
Cantelon began his teaching career at Williams College in 1968, specializing in contemporary American and Oral history. In 1974, he took a leave of absence from Williams to work in the policy office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development and as a speechwriter for Secretary Carla Hills.
In 1978, he received a Fulbright Professorship of American Civilization to teach history for a year at Kyushu University and Seinan Gakuin University in Fukuoka, Japan. After his HUD and Fulbright experience, Cantelon turned from the classroom to the practical application of history – what would become popularized as ‘public history’.
The opportunity to apply history came soon after the Three Mile Island accident in 1979. A former Williams colleague at the United States Department of Energy asked if Cantelon would write a history of the agency's response to the accident. Cantelon teamed up with Robert C. Williams, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis, to write Crisis Contained: The Department of Energy at Three Mile Island, published in 1980.
Struck by the impact of a practical application of history – and that historians could assess an event that happened months, not just decades before – he and three colleagues, Richard G. Hewlett, who was retiring as the Department of Energy’s Chief Historian, Williams, and Rodney P. Carlisle of Rutgers University established a new business venture. In January 1981, they founded History Associates Incorporated. Cantelon served as president from 1981 to 2006. Since then, he has served as the organization's CEO and senior historian. His client list includes General Electric, the Kendall Foundation, the GAR Foundation, Consolidated Edison, Texas Instruments, MCI Communications, Roadway Services, CF Transportation, the National Institute of Nursing Research, The Children’s Inn at NIH, The Institute of Nuclear Power Operations, and the World Association of Nuclear Operators.
Under Cantelon's leadership, History Associates has grown to become one of the largest historical consulting firms in the U.S. The company made the Inc. 500 list in 1986 and the Inc. 5000 list in 2012, 2013, and 2014.
Cantelon has been actively involved in numerous organizations that further the mission of public history. He was a founder of the National Council on Public History in 1979, serving as the organization's first executive secretary. During the same year, Cantelon helped charter the Society for History in the Federal Government, where he served as executive secretary from 1979 to 1983 and president from 1995 to 1996.
Cantelon has also served as chairman of the Montgomery County Historic Preservation Commission in Maryland, as well as president of the Montgomery County Historical Society. He continues to play an active role in both past and present issues impacting Montgomery County historic resources.

Antonio Carbonchi

Antonio Carbonchi was a 17th-century guitarist and composer who wrote two influential books on lute playing.
Biography.
Cabonshi was born in Florence, sometime around the year 1600. He joined the army of Tuscany in its war against the Turks, and for his courage in battle he was made a Knight of the Order of Tuscany. After his military service he became a musician, specializing in innovative music for the guitar family.
Publications and writings.
Carbonchi's first book, "Sonate de chitarra spagnola con intavolatura franzese", was published in Florence in 1640. This book was dedicated to Mattias de' Medici as a patron of music. The music in this book is written in French-style lute tabulature, regardless of whether the music was to be plucked or strummed. Carbonchi wrote that the French notation was in response to requests by his foreign students.
Carbonchi's second book, "Dodici chitarre spostate", was published in Florence in 1643. This volume was dedicated to the Marchese Bartolomeo Corsini. The final 32 compositions contained in this work are written for twelve guitars, each guitar tuned to a different note on the chromatic scale. Although such an ensemble is unlikely, it empirically proved the guitar's utility as a chromatic instrument.
In addition to the two published works, there exist manuscripts known to be by Carbonchi, as well as those attributed to him.
Style.
Carbonchi's compositions consist of music written in the Italian dance styles, including the Ciacconda, Passacaglia, and Spagnoletta various dance-songes.

Cameron Kasky

Cameron Marley Kasky (born November 11, 2000) is an American activist and advocate against gun violence who co-founded the student-led gun violence prevention advocacy group Never Again MSD. He is notable for helping to organize the March for Our Lives nationwide student protest in March 2018. Kasky is a survivor of the February 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.
Kasky was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018."
Early life and education.
Kasky was a student, a "theatre kid", and former member of the drama club at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School (MSD) in Parkland, Florida, and was a junior at the time of the school shooting in February 2018. He has a younger brother with autism who is also a survivor of the MSD shooting.
He currently attends Columbia University.
Advocacy.
Kasky had just left drama class when the shooting began at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on February 14, 2018. After he met his younger brother at a different classroom and exiting the school, the fire alarm sounded. With other students, they were instructed to go back inside. They waited an hour in a classroom until they were rescued.
After the shooting, Kasky brought several school friends to his house and with them founded Never Again MSD (#NeverAgain), a student-led gun control advocacy group. Kasky came up with the name "Never Again" while the group stayed up through the night to make plans, and he posted "Stay alert. #NeverAgain" to Facebook. The group works to create a national movement against gun violence, including an effort to publicize legislators receiving money from the NRA and persuading people not to vote for them. It promoted and led a massive rally called March for Our Lives in Washington, DC, on March 24, 2018.
According to a report in "The New Yorker", it was Kasky's idea to found the activist group along with fellow students David Hogg, X González, Sarah Chadwick and others – a group described by reporter Michael Schulman as having "moral clarity and vision" in the gun control debate. Kasky wrote an op-ed on the CNN website describing the events of the massacre and his reaction to it. In an interview, Kasky told the CNN anchor Anderson Cooper that "my generation won't stand for this." Although known as a "theatre kid" with a reputation for being the class clown, Kasky's experience after the shooting was primarily one of anger:
At a televised "Stand Up" town hall session sponsored by CNN with Senator Marco Rubio, Kasky asked the senator whether he would continue receiving money from the National Rifle Association (NRA): "Can you tell me right now that you will not accept a single donation from the NRA?" Rubio responded by saying, "I will always accept the help of anyone who agrees with my agenda." Kasky repeatedly questioned Rubio about whether he would continue receiving NRA money. The senator did not offer a definitive response but appeared to soften his positions regarding some gun restrictions.
Kasky temporarily stopped utilizing Facebook as a result of death threats. When later Kasky was accused of being a crisis actor, he replied to CNN's Wolf Blitzer that "if you had seen me in our school's production of 'Fiddler on the Roof,' you would know that nobody would pay me to act for anything."
Kasky announced the March for Our Lives rally on February 18, 2018. Later that week, Kasky appeared on "The Ellen DeGeneres Show" with X González and Jaclyn Corin to discuss their advocacy and march. Kasky said, "The thing that inspired us to create the march was people saying, 'This is not the time to talk about gun control, this is the time to mourn.' We understand that, so here's the time to talk about gun control. March 24th."
In March 2018, he appeared on the cover of "Time" magazine along with fellow activists Jaclyn Corin, X Gonzalez, David Hogg, and Alex Wind.
Kasky called President Donald Trump a "professional liar" on CNN after Trump delivered a pro-gun speech at the annual NRA convention in Dallas in May 2018, in contrast to Trump's prior call for gun control reform in the wake of the Parkland shooting. Kasky criticized the president to point out Trump said what he needed to say to appease the NRA.
In May 2018, Kasky's father registered a super PAC, Families vs Assault Rifles PAC (FAMSVARPAC), with intentions of going "up against NRA candidates in every meaningful race in the country".
New laws.
In March 2018, the Florida Legislature passed a bill titled the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act. It raises the minimum age for buying firearms to 21, establishes waiting periods and background checks, provides a program for the arming of some teachers and the hiring of school police, bans bump stocks, and bars potentially violent or mentally unhealthy people arrested under certain laws from possessing guns. In all, it allocates around $400 million. The governor signed the bill into law on March 9. He commented, "To the students of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, you made your voices heard. You didn't let up and you fought until there was change."
Departure from March for Our Lives.
On September 19, 2018, Kasky announced his decision to leave March for Our Lives in an interview with Fox News Radio. He expressed regret for some of his past actions, including confronting Rubio at the "Stand Up" town hall session and saying the name of the Parkland shooter aloud in his question to Rubio. However, Kasky said his decision to leave March for Our Lives was not due to a change of heart or political views. Instead, he wants to take responsibility for his actions and encourages others to seek mental health services when necessary. Moving past March for Our Lives, Kasky is working on improving himself personally and a new podcast, "Cameron Knows Nothing".
Reactions.
In "The New Yorker", journalist Evan Osnos singled out Kasky's direct questioning of Marco Rubio at the CNN town hall as significant and as something no journalist had ever been able to do. "People" magazine stated that as founder of the #NeverAgain movement, and despite death threats from NRA supporters, "Kasky has committed himself to advancing legislative changes that will make it more difficult for people to get guns, and in the process, has helped inspire advocacy around the cause".
Politics.
Kasky endorsed Andrew Yang in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, claiming to be "very tired of... the same nonsense that’s been failing the American people for generations. Yang is offering up solutions that change the game." Upon Yang dropping out, Kasky threw his support behind Bernie Sanders, and subsequently endorsed Joe Biden in the general election.
Personal life.
Kasky identifies as queer.

Feliks Chiczewski

Feliks Chiczewski (18 May 1889–1972) was a Polish diplomat. He distinguished himself during the expulsions of Polish Jews (known as the Polish Action) from Leipzig by the Nazi regime in October 1938. His actions as consul general resulted in up to 1500 Jews being spared from deportation.
Career.
Chiczewski was born in Sosnowiec, Poland, in 1889. He studied business in Antwerp followed by graduating from the University of Warsaw with a degree in higher administration. 
He spent his career working for the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where he served many roles. From 1920-1922, he was the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Gałacz. From 1922-1928 he held the same position in Bucharest, Romania. He left Romania in 1928 and worked in the Polish parliament and as a consul in Brussels until November 1934. On November 1, 1934, he became the Head of the Consulate of the Republic of Poland in Leipzig.
Polish Action (Polenaktion) of 1938 in Leipzig.
A 31 March 1938 decision made by the Polish government to terminate the citizenship of Poles who had lived abroad for more than 5 years left many Jews of Poland stateless. Rising tensions between the German and Polish foreign ministry lead to mass expulsions from the state of Saxony, the closest to the Polish border, beginning on 27 October 1938. 3364 of Leipzig's Jews were of Polish origin, making it the second largest population of Eastern European Jews in Germany.
Around 4am on 27 October 1938, arrests of Jews began taking place in Leipzig by the Gestapo. The consulate learned of the ongoing arrests by 6am. As warnings about the upcoming arrests and subsequent expulsions began to spread on 27 October, many Jews sought shelter at the Polish Consulate, which was a large villa that had been rented from the Ury family. Questions remained about the legitimacy of the villa as extraterritorial grounds since the Polish government had not purchased it outright. Despite this, the police did not enter the grounds over fears of further damaging the frail Germany-Poland relationship. Chiczewski and his staff supported Jews who arrived at his gates by providing food and shelter, albeit in a limited manner. The police checked identification papers of some people entering the villa, others were arrested outside of the consulate.
Personal accounts from survivors provide details of the situation inside the villa. Shlomo Wahrman, who spent several hours in the residence, described the Leipzigers as terrified about their unknown fate. Although Chiczewski had attempted to bring in as much food as he could, there was a severe food shortage. Since the villa lacked the means to support large numbers of people, significant assistance was provided by the local community, including families like the Wahrmans. Many Jews violated their religious observance of the Sabbath by cooking and baking on the grounds that saving lives overrides religious principle. The assistance of local businesses and individuals arriving at the villa supported the large population staying at the villa while Polish officials worked to protect them from deportation. Various sources estimate the number of Jews seeking shelter to have been between 1200-1500, with 1296 Jews being a common figure. Police reports indicate 1296 Jews had taken shelter there, roughly 50% of the Jewish population in Leipzig.
Chiczewski negotiated with the German foreign ministry to not only prevent the expulsion of the Leipzig Jews, but successfully allowed roughly 1300 Jews to return to their homes in Leipzig. According to Chiczewski's report, he received assurance from the Police Chief of Leipzig that the Jews would not have any trouble remaining in Germany until the matter had been resolved with a Polish-German agreement. Most of those who sought assistance from Chiczewski at the villa received a passport renewal to prevent them from becoming stateless individuals. Police reports indicated that Chiczewski encouraged others to burn their passports in order to prevent formal identification of their citizenship used in displacement and the passage over the border into Poland. However, this information is not included in Chiczewski's own report.
For the remaining Jews who had either not been warned, arrested before they could flee, or chose not to seek shelter, Chiczewski attempted to prevent their expulsion at each stage of the process. Chiczewski was not alone in his belief that the expulsions could be prevented, thus he and other Polish diplomats assured the Jews that their detainment had been a "mistake." Chiczewski made efforts at calming the Jews at the gymnasium where the Jews had been gathered, as well as at the train station. Despite his negotiations, he was ultimately unsuccessful in his attempts to block the deportations. Estimates vary on the number of Jews deported from Leipzig between 1500 and 3500. Wahrman reported that about 5000 were expelled.
Commemoration.
Feliks Chiczewski's actions during the expulsions of Polish Jews from Leipzig in October 1938 have garnered him recognition by the Polish Institute of Leipzig.
His actions were commemorated amongst other Polish heroes in the "They Risked Their Lives..." Exhibition which took place in Leipzig in 2015.
The Institute also honored the 70th anniversary of the event, where his sister in law, Gabriela Chiczewski, participated in his honor. In 2000, a plaque commemorating his actions was hung in front of the villa.

Ling Long (mathematician)

Ling Long is a Chinese mathematician whose research concerns modular forms, elliptic surfaces, and dessins d'enfants, as well as number theory in general. She is a professor of mathematics at Louisiana State University.
Early life and education.
Ling Long was born in the 1970s in China. She is the oldest child in her family; Ling has one younger brother Tao Long.
Long studied mathematics, computer science, and engineering at Tsinghua University, graduating in 1997. She went to Pennsylvania State University for her graduate studies; her dissertation, "Modularity of Elliptic Surfaces", she worked on with Noriko Yui, visiting from Queen's University, in her time as a graduate student. She was supervised and influenced by Winnie Li.
Career.
After postdoctoral research at the Institute for Advanced Studies, Long joined the faculty at Iowa State University in 2003.
She was the 2012–2013 winner of the Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize of the Association for Women in Mathematics.
She spent the 2012–2013 term at Cornell University with funding from the Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize. During this time, she conducted research in Galois representations with Ravi Ramakishna, and published a paper called "Some supercongruences occurring in truncated hypergeometric series". After her time at Cornell, she moved to Louisiana State.
Social factors.
Long acknowledged that there was a stigma against women pursuing math careers when she was growing up, and that it was unusual for girls to continue math after the age of twelve. However, she didn't let the opinions of others influence her decision to become a mathematician. Long participated in the Women in Number Theory (WIN) conference in 2008. While completing her PhD, she was influenced greatly by her supervisor, Wen-Ching Winnie Li. Li proved to be an influential mentor and role model for Long, especially in the midst of self-doubt as to whether she possessed the creativity needed for such a high level of mathematics.

J. Charles Jones

Joseph Charles Jones (August 23, 1937 – December 27, 2019) was an American civil rights leader, attorney, co-founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), and chairperson of the SNCC's direct action committee.
Jones was born in Chester, South Carolina. In 1961 Jones joined the Freedom Riders driving from Atlanta, Georgia, to Birmingham, Alabama; he was later arrested in Montgomery, Alabama. He led and participated in several sit-in movements during the 1960s. In 1966, Jones organized an activist organization called the Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs or ACCESS.
He was a graduate of Howard University Law School (1966). Jones passed the North Carolina State Bar in 1976. He also served as the chairperson for the Biddleville/Smallwood/Five Points Neighborhood Association.
Early life and education.
Jones was born in Chester, South Carolina, on August 23, 1937. His mother was an English teacher, and his father a Presbyterian missionary who went to rural areas to speak to people about Christianity. His birth was unexpected so he was born at his parents' house. He was often exposed to racial discrimination in his youth, and witnessed his parent attempt to save a young boy from being killed by the Ku Klux Klan after smiling at a white woman in the town.
There was a day, when I was about six, that Jonesy had been accused of smiling at a white lady uptown and the word was out that they (the Klan) were going to get him. So my father and his friend put Jonesy in the trunk of the car with some food, and they drove off. I didn’t understand it at the time, but they were saving him from being lynched – just for smiling at her. I began to realize the harsh consequences of not obeying the rules.  — J. Charles Jones
He lived in Chester for ten years until his family moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1947. They made the move so his father could attend Johnson C. Smith University, having been told by the church that he must acquire a degree. Jones himself later enrolled in Johnson C. Smith University for theology in 1960.
Civil rights activism.
On February 1, 1960, after attending the National Youth Summit Conference in the Soviet Union, Jones learned of a sit-in protest at the Greensboro Woolworth staged by four black activists to peacefully confront racial segregation. On February 8, 1960, Jones went to the vice chair of the student body and met with some of his classmates to inform them he intended to launch a similar sit-in protest in Charlotte's Woolworth on February 9. At least 200 of his classmates joined in the first sit-in at the local Woolworth. At that sit-in, Jones stated to reporters:
I have no malice, no jealousy, no hatred, no envy. All I want is to come in and place my order and be served and leave a tip if I feel like it.  — J. Charles Jones
On March 7, 1960, after the local Woolworth closed its counters to prevent blacks from continuing their demonstration, around 100 students went to a local hardware store and sat at the soda fountain until they were served to continue the protest. Students from Livingston College joined in the movement as well, and went to Salisbury drug stores to sit-in. Two of the stores refused them service. Some teenagers then subsequently staged picket lines at local drug stores in the city that refused to serve blacks. Jones and the students from Johnson C. Smith University returned on March 24, 1960, to Woolworth, as Jones stated, to "keep up the demonstrations as a symbol and to keep the public aware of the discrimination" blacks faced in the region.
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.
Jones co-founded the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), with Ella Baker and many others at Shaw University in 1960. He was involved in leading and participating in many sit-ins and other protests for the committee. Jones stated of his participation in the sit-ins, "We were obligated to do it. The movement had caught fire."
After staging a sit-in in Rock Hill, South Carolina, nine black activists were arrested for "refusing to stop singing hymns during their morning devotions." In response, the SNCC sent Jones, Charles Sherrod, Diane Nash, and Ruby Doris Smith to get arrested in order to carry out the committee's "jail, no bail" newly designed strategy, which was intended to prevent the movement from being financially disenfranchised by being jailed and having to pay money for bail.
On July 19, 1962, Jones obtained a permit and organized an integration protest at the all-white Tift Park in Albany, Georgia. The police however, still kept the blacks segregated in a more secluded area of the park. The Albany park officials stated they had been tricked into allowing blacks to stage the protest at the park, stating that white people had submitted the permit and that they were not aware blacks would be present. Jones and two other black SNCC activists used the all-white restroom at the park, and the police quickly closed all of bathrooms in the park except for two which were kept under close police supervision.
On July 27, 1962, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., William G. Anderson, Slater King, Ralph Abernathy, and five other black civil rights activists and leaders lined up in front of the Albany City Hall's police headquarters to demand a discussion with the city government about racial integration in the city. The police chief refused to let them into the building, and King asked Abernathy to lead the activists in a prayer. The police chief stated that if they did not leave they would be arrested. They all refused to leave. King had previously stated that they were willing to fill every jail in Georgia for demonstrating for civil rights. They were then all arrested and led into the jail. A few hours after these arrests Jones led a group of seventeen more activists (including Freedom Singer Rutha Harris) to the police headquarters. Jones proceeded to kneel and read from a written prayer. The police chief paced among the protesters as Jones prayed. After the prayer was completed, Jones requested that the activists stay kneeling in "peaceful meditation". The police chief ordered the group to move, and when they refused for the third time the chief said that the protesters could either walk into the jail peacefully or be brought in forcibly. Ten of the activists walked into the jail to be arrested, and the remaining members continued to kneel in place and were forcibly brought into the jail on stretchers.
Freedom Riders.
In 1961 Jones participated in the Freedom Riders movement. He and other activists rode buses into the segregated southern United States, to challenge the non-enforcement in the southern United States of the Supreme Court rulings "Morgan v. Virginia" (1946) and "Boynton v. Virginia" (1960), which decided that segregated public buses were unconstitutional.
We got on the bus, we went further south, and the crowds of angry white folk started to get bigger and bigger. I heard my grandma's spirit say, "You're God's child; you're as good as any of them."  — J. Charles Jones
March on Washington.
In 1963, Jones participated in the planning for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. He recalled attending the I Have a Dream speech by King, and was struck with awe at the number of people who showed up.
I had never seen that many people. I said 'Oh my God.' My spirit just began to lift and lift and lift, and I was awed at that moment at what 
was happening.  — J. Charles Jones
After witnessing King begin to deliver his speech, he said that he knew change was going to happen.
ACCESS.
In June 1966 Jones founded a movement named the Action Coordinating Committee to End Segregation in the Suburbs (ACCESS) to attempt to end the racial segregation he saw occurring in the Washington beltway. With a group of fellow activists he marched the entire of Georgia Avenue. His intention was to bring attention to the local white landlords who refused to rent to black people. Jones stated the apartments around the Beltway, were essentially creating a "white ghetto surrounding the black ghetto". The protest march took four days to complete.
In 1967, Jones attended a meeting with the eighth U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. Jones believed this was a viable way to solve the segregation of black people from white landlords as the military had the power to make apartments which refused to rent to black people off limits to all military personnel. Such a move would financially motivate the apartments to change their racially discriminatory policies. In June 1967, Secretary of Defense McNamara followed through on Jones' suggestion and banned all service members from residing at any apartment which was segregated within a radius of the Andrews Air Force Base Air traffic control tower.
Later life and legacy.
Jones moved to the majority black Biddleville community in Charlotte, N.C., where he worked as an attorney. He considered himself semi-retired in his later years. However, he continued to be an active advocate for his community. He combined and served as the chairperson for the Biddleville Neighborhood Association and the Smallwood Community Organization. The organizations were previously split by race, and Jones is credited with causing their integration. Tom Hanchett, a historian, stated of Jones that he was "ageless" and continued to make historical changes around him well into his 80s:
Charles Jones talked about a beloved community, a city in which we all talked to each other, respect each other. Because of Charles Jones we are much closer to that beloved community than we would’ve been without his courage.  — Tom Hanchett
On December 9, 2019 the city council of Charlotte officially declared that day to be "Joseph Charles Jones Day"; on his behalf, his wife accepted the honor. Jones died on December 27, 2019, at the age of 82 from complications of Alzheimer's disease and sepsis. Charlotte City Councilman Justin Harlow described Jones after his death as "a true stalwart in advocacy".

Microtis brownii

Microtis brownii, commonly known as the sweet mignonette orchid or sweet onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to sixty small, green and white scented flowers well-spaced along the flowering stem. It usually grows in swampy places, flowers more prolifically after summer fires and sometimes forms very large colonies.
Description.
"Microtis brownii" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between five and fifty green to yellowish-green and white flowers are well-spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are scented, about long and wide. The dorsal sepal is about long, wide and forms a hood over the column. The lateral sepals are about long with their tips rolled under. The petals are about long and held under the dorsal sepal or alongside it. The labellum is about long, wide with crinkled edges and bends down to almost touch the ovary. Flowering occurs from November to January but more prolifically after fire the previous summer.
Taxonomy and naming.
"Microtis brownii" was first formally described in 1871 by Heinrich Gustav Reichenbach and the description was published in "Beitrage zur Systematischen Pflanzenkunde". The specific epithet ("brownii") honours the Scottish botanist Robert Brown.
Distribution and habitat.
The sweet mignonette orchid usually grows in swampy places but sometimes in woodland, forest or inland granite outcrops. It sometimes forms colonies of thousands of plants and is widespread and common, especially between Perth and Esperance.
Conservation.
"Microtis brownii" is classified as "not threatened" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Leader of the Opposition (Portugal)

The Leader of the Opposition () is an unofficial, mostly conventional and honorary title traditionally held by the leader of the largest party in the Assembly of the Republic – the Portuguese parliament – not within the government; historically, since the Carnation Revolution of 1974, these have almost always been the Socialist and the Social Democratic Parties.
Currently, the Socialist Party holds a minority government. The Opposition consists of the Social Democratic Party, the Left Bloc, the Portuguese Communist Party, CDS – People's Party, People–Animals–Nature, Ecologist Party "The Greens", Enough!, Liberal Initiative, and LIVRE.
The current Leader of the Opposition is Rui Rio, since 18 February 2018, after having been elected President of the Social Democratic Party on the previous 13 January.
Role.
Due to its workings being based mostly on custom and convention, the Leader of the Opposition has a small official role, even though it is legally, honorifically, and nominally recognised. Law No. 40/2006, that establishes the order of precedence of public authorities in general official acts, places the Leader of the Opposition in eighth place in the list of precedences, only behind the President of the Republic, the legislative speaker, the sitting Prime Minister of Portugal, the presidents of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court, the presidents of the Supreme Administrative Court and the Court of Auditors, former presidents of the Republic, and sitting government ministers.
Even though the Leader of the Opposition is not entitled to a specific salary aside from the one they may have by reason of holding a public office on their own – such as that of deputy – the officeholder usually receives much more attention from the media in parliamentary sessions and activities. It is not, however, required for a Leader of the Opposition to hold the post of deputy in the Assembly of the Republic – Rui Rio, who currently leads the Opposition, held no parliamentary seat until 25 October 2019.

Repealing and Amending Act, 2016

The Repealing and Amending Act, 2016 is an Act of the Parliament of India that repealed 295 Acts, and also made minor amendments to the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Work Place (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, and the Governors (Emoluments, Allowances and Privileges) Amendment Act, 2014. The Act was the third such repealing act tabled by the Narendra Modi administration aimed at repealing obsolete laws.
Background and legislative history.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated the repeal of old laws during his 2014 general election campaign. At the 2015 Economic Times Global Business Summit, Modi stated, "Our country suffers from an excess of old and unnecessary laws which obstruct people and businesses. We began the exercise of identifying unnecessary laws and repealing them. 1,877 Central laws have been identified for repeal."
"The Repealing and Amending (Fourth) Bill, 2015" was introduced in the Lok Sabha on 27 July 2015 by the Minister of Law and Justice, D.V. Sadananda Gowda. The bill sought to repeal 295 Acts, including over 20 Acts enacted before independence, and pass amendments to two Acts. The Bill sought to replace the term "Local Complaints Committee" with "Local Committee", and "Internal Complaints Committee" with "Internal Committee" in the Sexual Harassment of Women at the Work Place (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.
The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on 6 August 2015. Before being passed, the Lok Sabha officially renamed the bill as the "Repealing and Amending (Third) Bill, 2015". The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on 27 April 2016. The bill received assent from President Pranab Mukherjee on 6 May, and was notified in "The Gazette of India" on 9 May 2016.
Repealed Acts.
The 295 Acts included in the bill's First Schedule were completely repealed.

Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 16 isoform 1

Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 16 (TTC16) is an uncharacterized protein that in humans is encoded by the gene "TTC16." Another alias for this gene is "TPR repeat protein 16", but this is not commonly used. TTC16 is one of many proteins that contain tetratricopeptide repeat motifs as a supersecondary structure.
Gene.
The "TTC16" gene is located on human chromosome 9 at site 9q34.11. TTC16 is made up of ten tetratricopeptide motifs and has 16 exons. Other notable TPR containing peptides include HOP, PEX5, and neutrophil cytosolic factor 2. TTC16 is highly conserved among species, found among invertebrates such as the eastern oyster ("Crassostrea virginica") and the purple sea urchin ("Strongylocentrotus purpuratus"). TTC16 has no paralogs.
Transcription Factors.
The many transcription factors of TTC16 are commonly found in cells of the immune system, including several types of white blood cells and red blood cells, the respiratory system, and the endocrine system.
Protein.
The TPR motifs that make up TTC16 belong to the TPR_11 super family, while the later half of the protein is made of the Pumilio Superfamily. The molecular weight is 98.3 kdal and the isoelectric point is 9.15 making TTC16 a basic protein. In total, the TTC16 protein is 873 amino acids in length. There are two isoforms, of which variant 1 is the longest. There are 17 spliced versions of the gene.
Post Translational Modifications.
The protein contains many putative binding sites and forms alpha helix chains. Within the cell, TTC16 is found within the nucleus. Most of the post translational modifications are concentrated in the latter half, phosphorylation in particular is constant in the Pumilio Superfamily region. There are also 4 nuclear localization signals and 7 O-linked glycosylation sites. There are no N-linked glycosylation sites.
Structure.
TTC16 forms several alpha helices and coiled-coil regions. Domains containing TPR motifs show stronger stability than regions without.
Protein Interactions.
There is only one known case of TTC16 interaction, involving polymerase basic protein 2 (pb2). Pb2 is involved in transcription initiation and the generation of primers for viral transcription.
Expression.
TTC16 is found in high numbers in the testis, followed by the lung, pituitary gland, and tonsil. Evidence shows the omental adipose tissue of obese children have higher expression of TTC16 in comparison to non-obese children. Expression is also relatively high and constant CD8+ cells.
Function.
Tetratricopeptide motifs often act as stabilizers in protein-protein interactions. While the specific function of TTC16 isn't well understood by scientists, many other proteins containing TPR motifs give insight into its possible activity. Because of the many connections to the immune system, such as tissue expression and transcription factors, it is thought that TTC16 plays a role in immune system response.

Grant Ujifusa

Grant Ujifusa was born on January 4, 1942, in Worland, Wyoming, and grew up with his younger sister Susan on a sugar beet farm not far from that agreeable and friendly small town, one very much still located about 65 miles southeast of Heart Mountain, perhaps the most famous of the camps where Japanese Americans were imprisoned during World War II. Grant's grandfather, Ujifusa Shuichi, came to northern Wyoming in 1905 to help to lay track for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad. After the work was completed, Shuichi decided to shovel and level farmland out of the local erose desert and raise a family, including Grant's father Tom, in an isolated geological basin surrounded by the Rocky Mountains and three sister ranges. Through the arid basin flowed the Big Horn River from which water was diverted to irrigate Shuichi's farm.
So the Ujifusa family, a 1000 miles from the West Coast, was not sent to a camp during World War II. Nor was the family of Grant's mother Mary Takayo, whose father Okugawa Jukichi settled in La Junta, Colorado, and found work as a machinist on the Santa Fe Railroad. Mary had the best grades in the La Junta High School Class of 1939, and was named the valedictorian. The teachers and the kids really liked her, but the administrators and the school board said, "No jap will speak at our commencement." And so she didn't.
But Mary could speak, read, and write Japanese with complete fluency, because she had attended a Japanese language school, established by local immigrants, for 3 months every summer for 12 years. Mary was an exceptional student year round, but her family was too poor to send her to college. And so a marriage was arranged for the eldest child in the Okugawa family, a marriage that became a love match between Mary and Tom.
One of Grant's earliest memories was formed when eight Heart Mountain internees were given leave to help with Grandpa's 1944 sugar beet harvest. The men lived with the family in the big farm house. Grant, the toddler, grew especially close to internee Joe Furuta of Tacoma, and would lock the fingers of his small hands around the back of Mr. Furuta's neck and, hanging like a monkey, be carried from place to place. Joe Furuta was a lovely, gentle man, imprisoned of course at Heart Mountain because he was surely a spy and a saboteur.
When Grant was about 9, Grandpa Shuichi advised his grandson, called Masa in a three generation household, that "You have to be careful in life because you come from a dumb family." "Why would you say something like that, Grandpa?" the once bi-lingual Masa asked. "Because," Grandpa said, "I voluntarily chose to settle in a part of the world to which 11,000 people were involuntarily removed. Think about it."
Grandpa, besides raising sugar beets, ran a big herd of cattle on the open range outside of Worland, ridin' and ropin' just like the other local cowboys, with one of them saying years later, "You know that Japanese man out there with us once. Pretty good little wrangler." Not bad for the descendant of Japanese peasant farmers who lived for generations in a country where only the upper, but not the lower, class of samurai could get near a horse. 
In 1938 or 1939, the Japanese Consul General in San Francisco journeyed all the way to Worland to offer Grandpa 10,000 acres in Manchuria to raise open range beef cattle. Not many Japanese, maybe none, knew how to do that. To be a rancher on horseback like those around him in the surrounding mountains was farmer Grandpa's dream. The family was packed and ready to go when Grandpa at the last minute changed his mind and decided to stay in Wyoming. 
Then in 1951, they struck oil on Grandpa's farm. After which he said, "Actually, people say I am very smart, but I am something much better than that, which is lucky, Karma lucky.
Married to the Issei cowboy was gentle Grandma Yae, ever caring, a Buddhist saint, a bodhisattva, if ever there was one in the state of Wyoming. 
Susan was close to Grandma, and Tom, completely devoted to his family, was more like his mother than his father. Tom died in 2002. After Mary died in 2007, Ambassador Ryozo Kato said of her, "Mary was a woman of fierce academic and practical intelligence, and a woman who was immensely proud of her Japanese heritage. I mourn her passing."
As a 149-pound high school senior, Grant was an all-conference quarterback of a state championship football team—ranked number one in the state in 1959, the same year he was elected Governor of Boys State. The year before Grant Ujifusa and the Worland Warriors defeated Dick Cheney and the Casper Mustangs by the score of 39 to 6. The Warriors had 450 kids in their high school; the Mustangs, 1800 kids. Twenty-nine years later, Grant persuaded Congressman Cheney to vote "yea" on HR 442.
Grant left Wyoming to receive an AB with honors in 1965 from Harvard University, where he was an editor of "The Harvard Crimson", and an ABT from Brown University in American History and Literature in 1969. Some twelve years later Min Yasui and Mike Masaoka recruited Ujifusa to lead the Japanese American Citizens League in its successful effort to pass and enact HR 442, the Japanese American redress bill. Signed into law by Ronald Reagan on August 10, 1988, the legislation provided for an apology and monetary reparations from the federal government for Franklin Roosevelt's imprisonment of loyal Americans during World War II.
From 1982 to 1992, Grant served as JACL's volunteer Redress Strategy Chair, but he did nothing but watch Spark Matsunaga work three intense years to put together a 69-vote, filibuster-proof majority for Senate passage of the redress bill in the spring of 1988. Why the bi-partisan support? One reason: Sparky called in all his chits owed to him over the years from fellow senators. Another reason: Sparky's colleagues just loved him, someone who lived the Aloha understanding of life. Senate success, Daniel Inouye said, was ten parts Matsunaga and one part the other Senator from Hawaii. This means no parts for a Senator from Wyoming and a one-time Boy Scout who voted to strip all of the monetary reparations out of the bill, saying on the Senate floor that "the money sticks in my craw" and recently in the "Washington Post" that the money in the bill made the apology "insincere." The long ago Boy Scout from Wyoming cannot name a single Senator he persuaded to vote for Sparky's bill. And so, Sparky's legacy should be returned to him.
In 1990, Grant worked with Senator Inouye and with Janet Hale in the first Bush Administration's Office of Management and Budget to make the monetary reparations authorized in the bill an entitlement expenditure, not subject to the vagaries of the annual appropriations process.
In 2012, Grant was knighted by the Government of Japan for his work done in 1987 and 1988 that reversed Ronald Reagan's longstanding opposition to HR 442.
While lobbying the redress bill, Grant also worked as a Senior Editor of general interest books at Random House, earlier at Houghton Mifflin and later at Macmillan. Writers with whom he worked included Andrew Grove, Senator Sam Ervin, Governor Tom Kean, Lester Thurow, Robert Eisner, Kevin Phillips, Julian Jaynes, Judy Shelton, Yuji Ichioka, Merry White, and Daniel Yergin.
Ujifusa was, as well, the founding editor and longtime co-author of "The Almanac of American Politics," called by Tim Russert and George Will "the bible of American politics." The 1600-page, pre-internet, biennial volume provided description and analysis, using words and numbers, for each of the 535 members of the House and the Senate and for all of the 535 constituencies represented in Congress. Also covered were the 50 state governors. This meant "The Almanac," a National Book Award finalist in 1973, encompassed the "entire" geographical expanse of the country and its people three times. Ujifusa co-authored the book from 1972 to 2000 when it was an everywhere presence inside the Beltway, used by everyone with any responsibility in the White House, Congress, the media, the cabinet and agency bureaucracies, and the lobbying and law firms.
"The Almanac" gave Grant access virtually anywhere he wanted in Washington during the 1980s, most importantly in the Reagan White House and among Republican members of Congress. Grant convinced not only Dick Cheney, but also Newt Gingrich, to vote "yea" on HR 442, even while a Japanese American congressman from San Jose voted "present." Another Japanese American congressman from Sacramento waived his rights to any forthcoming $20,000 so that he could vote "yea" on the floor, which he did, contributing to the 218 votes needed to guarantee passage.
Grant decided to join the redress movement because of what was denied to his mother at her high school graduation and because of his memories of Joe Furuta. For his work on redress, Grant was made an honorary member of K Company, 442 RCT. More on his experience of redress and life in Wyoming can be found at: grantujifusa.com. As for Susan, she was elected Governor of Girls State, and went to Wellesley after high school.
For 10 years between 2001 and 2011, Ujifusa worked as a political consultant at the New York Japanese Consulate, and from 2001 to the present, on Wall Street. He is married to Amy Brooks, a graduate of Sarah Lawrence and the Juilliard School of Music. They have two biological sons, Steven, a historian who recently published "Barons of the Sea" with Simon and Schuster and Andrew, a journalist with "Education Week. "Both are graduates of Harvard. Adopted son John, Amy, and Grant live in Chappaqua, New York, a suburb about 30 miles north of New York City, but they regularly return to their Wyoming farm, which has now been in family hands for 107 years."

Sophia Dubochet

Sophia Dubochet (29 June 1794 – 29 August 1875), also known as "Sophia Wilson", was an English courtesan, who became the wife of Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick. 
Early life.
Sophia was the daughter of John James Dubochet, a Swiss clockmaker who worked in Mayfair, London, and his wife, Amelia (née Cook) Dubochet. Another of their daughters was Harriette Wilson. Another sister, Amy, later had an illegitimate child by George William Campbell, 6th Duke of Argyll, who had also been Harriette's lover.
Personal life.
According to Harriette's memoirs, the teenage Sophia, "a remarkably shy, proud girl", was being pursued by Viscount Deerhurst, and Harriette recommended to her mother that Sophia be sent away to school. However, she eloped with Deerhurst, who, when found by her family, "declared that nothing wrong had occurred, he having passed the night with Sophia in mere conversation". Nevertheless, he moved her into squalid lodgings.
Sophia quickly built up her own circle of admirers, including William FitzGerald, 2nd Duke of Leinster, and George Lamb. Initially, she claimed to dislike Berwick, but was eventually persuaded to marry him.
Marriage to Lord Berwick.
On 8 February 1812, seventeen year old Sophia married forty-one year old Thomas Noel Hill, 2nd Baron Berwick at St Marylebone Parish Church, London, after an on-off courtship. They had no children. At Brighton, the new Lady Berwick was both admired and reviled for her lack of "illustrious descent". A local paper commented that "the late abuse of the press has in no degree diminished the vivacity so characteristic of her ladyship and family." However, it has been suggested that, after her marriage, Sophia deliberately snubbed her sisters. 
The couple's extravagance was such that Lord Berwick went bankrupt in 1827. They were forced to sell most of their property, lease the house to his brother and live abroad. Lord Berwick died in Naples in 1832 and the barony was inherited by his younger brother, William Noel-Hill who became the 3rd Baron Berwick. Lady Berwick retired to Leamington Spa, where she died in her eighties.
Legacy.
Her portrait in miniature was painted by Richard Cosway in about 1812, and is held in the collection at Attingham Park.

Full Screen Mario

Full Screen Mario is a 2013 browser game created by American programmer Josh Goldberg. It is an unofficial remake of the 1985 game "Super Mario Bros." and was built using HTML5.
Gameplay.
As a remake of "Super Mario Bros." (1985), "Full Screen Mario"s gameplay is similar: it is a side-scrolling platform game in which the player controls Mario through levels. The game features all 32 levels that appeared in the original "Super Mario Bros.", and adds the option to select any one from the start. It also features an editor that enables players to create their own levels and a level generator that creates a random map. The game can also be played using an Xbox 360 controller.
Development.
"Full Screen Mario" was created by Josh Goldberg, who at the time was a junior at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Goldberg, who studies computer science and is a longtime "Super Mario Bros." fan, wanted to create an "impressive" project when he conceived remaking a classic game in HTML5. One day, he and a friend discussed "how cool it would be if you could play "Mario" in [your] browser" and determined "Super Mario Bros." was simple enough to remake. Goldberg began working on "Full Screen Mario" in October 2012 and finished a working demo the following month. From the beginning, Goldberg knew he wanted to add a map generator and a level editor; he wanted his remake to feel more modern when compared to playing the game in an emulator. "Full Screen Mario" uses the canvas element to render the levels. Unlike the original game, "Full Screen Mario" can be played in widescreen.
Goldberg opted to recreate game assets from scratch to optimize them for browsers instead of ripping content from a ROM image. He used his personal copy of "Super Mario Bros. Deluxe" as a reference; he also consulted images of the original game's level designs from the internet and used them to manually recreate each level. Goldberg said this was tedious and took a considerable amount of time, but was not difficult. His greatest challenge was recreating the game's physics. According to Goldberg, "I'd never really made the physics before. People would randomly disappear during the game." He spent months trying to perfect Mario's jumping physics. Goldberg said that remaking "Super Mario Bros." was enjoyable because he could aspire to make it perfect: "Once your version matches the original, you know it's right". However, it was difficult for him to perfectly recreate the original game, and he spent a lot of time scrutinizing his work to make it as close as possible. After the initial release, Goldberg switched the code base from JavaScript to TypeScript to help reduce program bugs and crashes.
Release.
Goldberg revealed "Full Screen Mario" on GitHub in January 2013. The game did not garner much attention until October 2013, when a writer on the website "Boing Boing" blogged about the game. This led to a significant increase in popularity. Shortly afterward, the website hosting the game, "fullscreenmario.com", was getting around 300,000 visits a day. After about a month, on November 1, 2013, the project was taken down after receiving a DMCA complaint from Nintendo, the publisher of "Super Mario Bros." Nintendo argued the game infringed its copyright of the original game. By the time of the takedown, it had been played nearly 2.7 million times. Prior to the project's demise, Goldberg desired to add the option to share levels via email and multiplayer support. The source code for "Full Screen Mario" remained on GitHub for download, but was removed in 2016 after Nintendo issued another DMCA complaint.

Garrick Sokari Braide (1882-1918) was an African preacher. Braide was born in Obonoma in the Niger Delta region, and grew up in Bakana. He was baptized in 1910 at the age of 28, and was confirmed in 1912.
Braide offered an African alternative to traditional evangelism. Rather than teaching creeds, he campaigned mainly on the destruction of idols. Braide also campaigned particularly effectively against alcohol consumption.
After successes at healing people, Braide began to be viewed by his followers as a prophet. 
The decrease in alcohol consumption led authorities, worried about decreased tax revenue, to investigate him. Braide was arrested in March 1916 on charges including disturbing the peace. Braide was released from prison in 1918, and died later that year.
His followers established the Christ Army Church of Nigeria in 1916.

Anjeunbaengi wheat

Anjeunbaengi wheat, also known as Jinju native wheat, is a variety of wheat originating in southern South Korea. The wheat has been noted for its durability and relatively quick growing time.
Cultivation.
Anjeunbaengi wheat is primarily grown in the southern provinces of South Korea, where the warmer climate can better stimulate plant growth than in the north. The stalk of the wheat is short, being only between 50-80 cm tall. The next years wheat crop is sown in late October and early November. In the next summer, the wheat can be double cropped with rice. Harvesting of the wheat commences in June.
The wheat crop suffered when in 1984 the South Korean government ceased subsidizing wheat. This cessation resulted in 
Anjeunbaengi wheat becoming increasingly uncommon.
Description.
The berry of the wheat is small, red, and has been described as having a sweet taste and a pleasant aroma. The wheat is low in gluten, and is commonly used in Korean wheat noodles and dumplings.

Christopher Leslie Elliott

Major General Christopher Leslie Elliott (born 18 March 1947) is a retired senior British Army Officer and author.
Elliott is the son of Peter Archibald Elliott, a civil engineer, and Evelyn Sarah (née Wallace). He was educated at Pocklington School, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst and the Royal Military College of Science, Shrivenham, where he earned a bachelor's degree in engineering.
Military career.
Elliott was commissioned into the Royal Engineers in 1967, became a lieutenant in 1969, Captain in 1973, and Major in 1979. In 1969 he was created a Member of the Order of British Empire for Gallantry, following an incident in which he was instrumental in rescuing an injured man whilst climbing on Mont Blanc.
Elliott commanded 48 Field Squadron Royal Engineers from 1980. He was made a Lieutenant-Colonel in 1984 and a Colonel in 1989. He commanded 21 Engineer Regiment (1986–88) and the 6th Armoured Brigade (1990–91) as part of the British Army of the Rhine. His military staff appointments included Assistant Chief of Staff 1st British Corps (1988–90), Director of Studies at the Staff College, Camberley (1991–92), Director of the UK Higher Command and Staff Course, and the Director of Military Operations in the Ministry of Defence (1993–95).
Elliott studied as a Defence Fellow at University of Southampton in 1986, leading to the award of Master of Philosophy from Cranfield University. His work, in collaboration with Professor Geoffrey Mays and Dr. Peter Smith, investigated the impact of terrorist explosive attacks on domestic and commercial buildings and suggested structural arrangements to protect against their worst effects. As a result of this work, the Institution of Civil Engineers formed a Working Party—including Elliott— which led to changes to UK Building Regulations to improve building safety in the event of a blast. In 1995, he contributed a chapter to the book "Blast effects on buildings: design of buildings to optimize resistance to blast loading". The same year Elliott was promoted to the rank of acting Major General and was appointed Military Advisor to Carl Bildt, Chairman of the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia, playing a part in the Dayton Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. On his substantive promotion to Major General in January 1996, Elliott was made Director General and Chief Executive of the newly formed UK Army Training and Recruiting Agency, with a remit to retain more recruits, including changing the historic culture of training to one more effective given the changes in gender, race, educational and social backgrounds of those enlisting. After three years he was created a Companion of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath. He then served as Chief of Staff to the Quartermaster General from 1999 to 2000, and ended his military career as the UK Director General of Doctrine and Development, retiring from active service in 2002. For his last six years of service he was a Commissioner of the Royal Hospital, Chelsea.
Later life.
On leaving military service, Elliott was appointed a director of General Dynamics UK (2002–2010) and a consultant for Ove Arup and Partners (2002–12). He was a visiting professor to Cranfield University from 2002 to 2015. Elliott served as colonel commandant of the Corps of Royal Engineers from 2000 to 2008, President of the Institution of Royal Engineers from 2002 to 2007 and was a member of the Royal United Services Institute Acquisition Forum examining defence procurement. He was President of Victim Support Wiltshire, an independent charity supporting the victims of crime, from 2003 to 2009. Whilst some sources state that Elliott co-founded and chaired Purple Secure Systems Ltd, an IT consultancy from 2006 to 2009, Companies House records indicate he served as a director from 16 February 2007 to 24 April 2009.
In 2012 Elliott enrolled as a Research Fellow in the "Changing Character of Warfare Programme" in the Faculty of History of the University of Oxford, studying under Professor Sir Hew Strachan. At the same time, he was admitted as a Research Fellow at the School of Politics and International Relations at the University of Reading and appointed an Associate Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute. His studies led to the publication of "High Command" which examined the performance of the UK's High Command during the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars from 2000 to 2010"." Elliott concluded that the Service Chiefs had been set at odds by the Ministry of Defence structure, making them almost rivals, with responsibility diffuse and authority ambiguous; that the UK High Command fell into the trap of doing just enough to satisfy the demands of the hour, but never enough to deliver strategic success. The result was that in two wars success on the battlefield had eluded them, but still at great cost in lives and money"." The book was positively reviewed, and won the Society for Army Historical Research's "Templer Best First Book Award" in 2015. He has since lectured on the subject.
Eliott enjoys sailing and paragliding. He was Commodore of the Royal Engineer Yacht Club (1995–96) and the Army Sailing Association (2000–02). and President of the Joint Services Paragliding and Hang Gliding Association (1993-2002). He is a Fellow of the Institution of Royal Engineers. He was elected as a Parish Councillor of Easton Royal from 2003 to 2017.
He married Margaret Bennett in 1970, with whom he had two daughters, one of whom has predeceased him.

Albina Girfanova

Albina Khakimovna Girfanova () (1 February 1957 – 2 February 2018), was a Russian linguist and anthropologist. She worked at the Institute for Linguistic Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, and later at Saint Petersburg State University, where she attained the rank of Docent (Associate professor). Girfanova is most known for her work on Udege and Oroch languages, as well as on a number of other Tungusic languages and Balkan languages. She is the author of the most significant vocabulary of Udege, published in Russia, as well as other important studies and reference sources of Udege, Oroch and Balkan languages.
Early life and education.
Girfanova was born in Weimar, which was then a city in East Germany (DDR), where her family was, probably, stationed at this time, working with the Soviet military. Later family moved to Saint Petersburg, and Girfanova started her undergraduate studies at the Department of General Linguistics (Faculty of Philology) at the Saint Petersburg State University. She majored in Albanian philology at the chair of Albanian language and literature, established at 1957 by initiative of Agnia Vasilevna Desnickaja. Albina Girfanova formed as a philologist and albanologist under the guidance of professors A. V. Desnickaja, G. I. Entrej, I. I. Voronina, etc. She graduated from the Saint Petersburg State University, majoring in Albanian, in 1981. However, she did not continue studies in Albanian, but joined Department of Altaic languages at the Leningrad Branch of the , Russian Academy of Sciences, in Saint Petersburg (at that time, Leningrad), and devoted herself to study of Tungusic languages and cultures of Tungusic peoples.
Academic career.
Writing and research.
Fellowship at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1981–1983).
Immediately upon graduation from Saint Petersburg State University Girfanova obtained a fellow position as a junior researcher (стажер-исследователь) at the department of Altaic languages at the Institute for Linguistics Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences (in years 1952 – 1991: the Leningrad branch of Institute of Linguistics of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR). She majored in Albanian at college, but switched to studying Tungusic languages, primarily Udege and Oroch. At the same time, she continued studying Turkish and Albanian, modern Greek – in time being, she became a veritable polyglot.
Post-graduate studies at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1983–1986).
After three years as a junior researcher, Girfanova secures a post-graduate position in her department. In the Soviet Academy's context at that time, successful graduation from this position practically guaranteed a life-time tenure with the institution; therefore, obtaining such position in the humanities at that time was considered a career success. Girfanova publishes several articles on Udege language. Upon graduation from her post-graduate studies, she is promoted to research fellow position at the same department.
Research at Institute for Linguistic Studies (1986–2003).
It took another two years for Girfanova to write and defend her Candidate of Science Dissertation (equivalent of PhD. thesis), entitled "Indicative Verb Forms in Udege Language", in 1988.
The pinnacle of her studies of Udege language becomes the most significant "Vocabulary of Udege Language", published in Russia.
Lexicographic studies.
Girfanova has invested considerable time into lexicography of Udege and Oroch languages. She will be mostly known as the author of the best "Vocabulary of Udege Language". It is not the first and only vocabulary of Udege language, but, according to the review by A. A. Byrykin, it is the most linguistically solid vocabulary of Udege.
Her lexicographic and etymological studies were not limited to Tungusic languages. She studied cross-linguistic connections of Balkan toponyms, etc. She was working on a project of a dictionary of Turkic terminology in the languages of Southeast Europe.
Grammar and Syntax studies.
Alongside time-consuming lexicographic work, Girfanova continued grammatical and syntactic studies of Tungusic languages, and devoted some time to the history of studying of these languages.
Anthropology studies.
Girfanova's interest to Tungusic peoples was not limited by language studies. She conducted folkloristic and ethnographic studies (marriage rites, kinship terminology), including study of shamanism. Girfanova was a member of International Society for Shamanistic Research.
Teaching and lecturing.
Department of General Linguistics, Saint Petersburg State University.
While in the Soviet Union position of a researcher at an institute of the Academy of Sciences used to be a life-time tenure position, there was no job security in the new Russia, and financing of the Academy decreased dramatically. In 2003, changes happened at Institute for Linguistic Studies, the Altaic department effectively stopped to exist, and Girfanova was let go. That was, in her own words in 2005, a painful crisis of her academic career: "two years ago the author, the only specialist in Udege language in the country, was fired from the Altaic department of ILI of RAS living out the rest of its days, abandoned by researchers and later abolished, in spite of the position of a scientific researcher successfully acquired three months before the department’s abolishment (I am the author of the only thesis of C. Sc. devoted to Udege language, written and defended in this country, 70 publications, including 5 monographs on the mentioned above Udege language)".
Fortunately, she was immediately hired by her alma mater, Saint Petersburg State University, as an associate professor (docent). Unfortunately, she had to revert to teaching Albanian and Turkish languages, which considerably diminished time for academic research and publications.
Educator, Cultural Ambassador and Linguistic Activist.
Girfanova did not only teach Tungisic and Balkan languages, she is also an author of popular books, presenting Udege and Albanian cultures to the world, so she was honoured by an obituary from Albanian Embassy in Russia - it is not something that done for a regular language professor. Beside being an academic scholar, she gave full assistance to the educational system in Russia, to educate students in Tungusic languages, publishing a few textbooks for elementary school. She was really concerned about well-being of endangered Tungusic languages, and was socially active to help them to survive. As Oliver Corff mentioned in his obituary for Girfanova, "Her critical understanding of the intentions and outcomes of Russia’s minority policies allowed her to come forward with substantial suggestions for improvements acknowledged by politicians. In autumn 2017 she was invited by the Department of Interior Politics of Primorsky Krai as moderator for a course on the revival of the Udege language in the framework of a larger nationality policy programme from 2018 to 2020. Pavel Yasevich, Director of the Department, lauds her as the foremost authority on Udege and Oroch languages in Russia."
Death.
Girfanova died on February 2, 2018, the day after her 61st birthday.

2018 Michigan Proposal 1

The Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, also known as Proposal 1, was an initiative that appeared on the November 2018 ballot to legalize cannabis in the U.S. state of Michigan. The initiative allows adults 21 and older to possess up to of cannabis and to grow up to 12 plants at home. The initiative was approved with 56% of the vote.
History.
In November 2017, supporters submitted 365,000 signatures to get legal recreational cannabis on the 2018 ballot. The state certified the initiative on April 26.
The "Detroit Free Press" reported that state Republicans planned to amend and attempt to pass the initiative in the state legislature. The amendment would involve an income tax cut offset by cannabis tax revenue, and regulation by the appointed board in charge of medical cannabis, not by the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs (LARA). If passed by the legislature, it would not appear on the general ballot.
By June 5, the deadline for an "adopt-and-amend" act to go through the legislature expired, and the un-amended initiative would appear on ballots in November.
Bill contents.
The Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, also sometimes referred to as the "RMLA", would legalize the possession of marijuana for those 21 years and older. The Act also contains a number of provisions that would change the state's marijuana and hemp laws, including:
Support.
The Coalition to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol is the main supporter of the initiative.
Opposition.
In February 2018, it was reported that Smart Approaches to Marijuana was funding opposition to the initiative, as they had in other states including California. Two other local groups, Healthy and Productive Michigan and the Committee to Keep Pot Out of Neighborhoods and Schools, were formed in 2017 to oppose the initiative.

Logie Awards of 2018

The 60th annual TV Week Logie Awards ceremony was held at The Star Gold Coast in Queensland, and broadcast live on the Nine Network. Public voting for the Most Popular Award categories ran from 5 March to 1 April 2018, with the shortlist of nominees revealed on 27 May. Voting reopened for the Popular Award categories on 29 June and remained open until the start of the ceremony, with each person given one extra vote in each category.
The red carpet arrivals was hosted by Karl Stefanovic and Georgie Gardner.
Each network is restricted in the number of personalities and programs they can submit for consideration in the publicly voted category, including up to 10 names in both the Most Popular Actor and Actress categories, 15 names for Most Popular Presenter and 5 programs for Most Popular Drama. These restrictions often lead to controversy over those who are not listed in the voting form, and as a result, they are not eligible to be nominated for an award.
Nominees.
Nominees were announced on 27 May 2018.
Changes.
As well as the introduction of "live voting" for 10 categories, the total number of categories were reduced from 27 at last year's ceremony to 20. 10 of the categories were voted for by the public, while the remaining 10 Outstanding Awards were industry voted. Publicly voted awards also reverted to being named "Most Popular" rather than "Best," which was introduced at the 2016 ceremony.
With the ceremony being held later in the year than previous events to avoid clashing with the 2018 Commonwealth Games also being held on the Gold Coast, the nomination eligibility was extended, meaning shows airing before 31 March 2018 could qualify for nomination. This marked the first Logie Awards to be held on the Gold Coast, after the Government of Victoria stopped providing funding for the event.

Shio Batmanishvili

Shio Batmanishvili (in Georgian: შიო ბათმანიშვილი, born in 1885 in Akhaltsikhe, Russian Empire – November 1, 1937, Karelia, Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic) was a Georgian Greek Catholic priest and a martyr during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge.
Biography.
Batmanishvili was born in 1885 in Akhaltsikhe, in the Tbilisi administration of the Russian Empire (today in Georgia). He studied at the Seminary of Constantinople and later theology in Rome, being ordained a priest in 1912. He initially exercised his ministry at Kutaisi and Akhaltsikhe, and from 1922 he was superior of the Servites of the Immaculate Conception monastery in Constantinople.
In 1925 Batmanishvili was received by Pope Pius XI, along with a group of Eastern Catholic priests, and was appointed Apostolic Administrator (some sources indicate that he was appointed Exarch) for the Georgian Catholics of the Byzantine rite.
On 16 October 1927 Batmanishvili was arrested in Tbilisi and on 16 January 1928 he was sentenced to ten years of hard labor without the possibility of amnesty, under Articles 58-6 and 58-12 of the penal code of the RSFSR, and was sent to the field of Solovki, where he arrived on February 12. 
In July 1932 he was accused of anti-Soviet agitation, holding liturgies and religious rituals, and transmitting information abroad on the situation of Catholics in the USSR. As a result he was isolated from the rest of the prisoners. In May 1935 Batmanishvili was transferred to work on the Kirov railway, and in June 1936 he returned to Solovki. On 14 October 1937 he was sentenced to death by the Directorate of the NKVD and executed on November 1 of that year in Medvezhegorsk.

Rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers

The rehabilitation and reintegration of child soldiers is defined by Child Soldiers International as: "The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities" A child soldier is "...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity".
Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family. Often the first step is to reunite the former child soldier with their family and provide adequate monetary and institutional support. Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments, but is often unavailable for economic reasons. Some studies have shown that community-led reintegration is more beneficial than Western-driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological challenges of reintegration.
There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult. Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated.
Female child soldiers commonly face additional barriers to successful reintegration. Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage. They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying.
Child soldiers.
As defined by the Paris Principles, a child soldier is:"...any person below 18 years of age who is or who has been recruited or used by an armed force or armed group in any capacity, including but not limited to children, boys and girls, used as fighters, cooks, porters, messengers, spies or for sexual purposes. The document is approved by the United Nations General Assembly. It does not only refer to a child who is taking or has taken a direct part in hostilities."Child soldiers can take on many roles, including active fighting, acting as spies or lookouts, or acting in support roles, such as medic, porter, cook, or agricultural labourer. While some child soldiers are abducted and forced to serve, others choose to serve. In many countries choosing to serve in an armed group is the best alternative for the child. Many children join the military because these groups will provide food, shelter, and a sense of security. For instance, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the choices facing children are often “to join the military, become a street child, or die” (Refugees International 2002). Similar situations face children throughout the world, with cited instances in Columbia and Sri Lanka. There is often a stigma that children who belonged to armed groups are immoral, untrustworthy, or dangerous and therefore many individuals are rejected by community members, making reintegration difficult. Former soldiers often have to fabricate “second stories” and live in fear of their former identity being discovered and it leading to loss of status, discrimination, exclusion, or even retaliation.There are also two areas of reintegration that warrant special consideration: female child soldiers and drug use among child soldiers. Child soldiers under the influence of drugs or who have contracted sexually transmitted diseases require additional programming specific to their unique needs.
Reintegration.
Child Soldiers International defines reintegration as: "The process through which children formerly associated with armed forces/groups are supported to return to civilian life and play a valued role in their families and communities"To facilitate the disarmament, demobilisation, and reintegration of former members of armed groups, the United Nations introduced the Integrated DDR Standards in 2006. Disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) are applied strategies for executing successful peacekeeping operations, especially after civil wars. Disarmament entails the physical removal of the means of combat from ex-belligerents (weapons, ammunition, etc.), demobilisation entails the disbanding of armed groups, and reintegration describes the process of reintegrating former combatants into civilian society, reducing the possibility of a resurgence of armed conflict. DDR programmes usually have a number of components including a focus on psycho-social care, the return of ex-child soldiers to education, job training, and supporting local initiatives, usually through various regional partnerships). Such programmes usually aim for children to either go back to their families or be placed with foster families.
Programs that aim to rehabilitate and reintegrate child soldiers, such as those sponsored by UNICEF, often emphasise three components: family reunification/community network, psychological support, and education/economic opportunity. These efforts take a minimum commitment of 3 to 5 years in order for programs to be successfully implemented. Generally, reintegration efforts seek to return children to a safe environment, to create a sense of forgiveness on the behalf of the child's family and community through religious and cultural ceremonies and rituals, and encourage the reunification of the child with his or her family.
Reintegration efforts can become challenging when a child has committed war crimes, as in these cases stigma and resentment within the community can be exacerbated. In situations such as these, it is important that the child's needs are balanced with a sense of community justice. If such situations are not addressed children face an increased likelihood of re-enlistment.
Reintegration programme components.
Family reunification.
Often the first step in the reintegration of child soldiers is family unification, that is reuniting the former child soldier with their families and providing adequate monetary and institutional support. When this is not possible attempts can be made to place former child soldiers in foster families or to assist the former child soldier with independent living. In Angola a family reunification project was implemented entitled "self-building program" which supported former child soldiers and their families in constructing a house. There may be concerns as to whether the family will accept the child after they have been a soldier. In Uganda this acceptance was assisted through the use of cleansing ceremonies, which assisted in the removal of community stigmatisation by "decontaminating" the child.
Community support and acceptance.
Community networks can also be instrumental in the reintegration of former child soldiers with their families and communities. Reintegration programs often aim to find a constructive social role for the former child soldier. Working in partnership with local NGOs can be important for capacity-building and to facilitate sustainable efforts that will last after international actors have left. In Angola a community-based network called Catechist has a partnership with approximately 200 churches. The Catechist was perceived as being neutral, having a sense of authority, and adherence to international humanitarian law. Given this, the network, respected by the community, has the capacity for outreach and was able to provide ongoing support the reintegration process. The broader community has also been witness to and a victim of the armed conflict. A focus on community healing is also an aspect of reintegration, because community healing can lead to community acceptance. Many armed conflicts occur among collectivistic societies and therefore this can be a better-suited approach. By involving the community in the healing processids outsider imposition of values and understanding. Before community healing can occur a more comprehensive approach is needed to remedy many systemic problems in war zones such as the short supply of water, food, shelter and other basic necessities. There is often a lack of professional, institutional, and economic support for this form of family and community reintegration.
Psychological support.
As part of their training child soldiers undergo a process of asocialisation and, consequently, may be resistant to changing their identity from that of a child soldier. Studies have shown that psychosocial approaches, a psychological process that takes place in the community, are more beneficial than Western-driven trauma healing in dealing with the psychological aspects of reintegration. Some of these approaches encompass emotional expression, group and individual counselling, cultural rituals, social reconstruction and emotional reintegration. These psychosocial approaches support physical health as well as cognitive, emotional and moral development. Through partnerships with local NGOs clinical psychologists are often able to train locals to administer these interventions empowering the community more directly in the healing process, instead of silencing local healers and local practices. Given this reintegration programs emphasise the opportunity for former child soldiers to establish trusting and consistent relationships with adults and also emphasise a family-based environment. Traditional rituals and family and community mediation can help to address the antisocial and aggressive behaviour a child soldier may have developed, and help the child recover from stressful and traumatic experiences.
Education and economic opportunity.
Education and economic opportunities help former child soldiers to establish new identities for themselves and to empower them to take active control of their lives. Access to education is one of the most requested forms of support in post-conflict environments. It is often unavailable for economic reasons. Access to formal education remains a challenge for a multitude of reasons as the need to earn an income can supersede the desire for education, families may not be able to afford education, schools are often destroyed in conflicts, teachers may have fled or have been killed, or there may be difficulty in obtaining documentation to enroll in educational institutions. In addition child soldiers frequently feel shame for their actions or there is resentment between the former child soldiers and their classmates. It is important to strike a balance between education and economic opportunities. Key aspects of striking this balance often include the creation of accelerated education programmes which suit the needs of the former child soldiers, focusing education on approaches that can generate income, such as market-appropriate vocational training and the inclusion of child soldier reintegration in the post-conflict economic policy of the country in question.
Female child soldiers.
Girls report significantly higher rates of rape and sexual abuse during a conflict and are, therefore, confronted with unique, gender-specific challenges. They often face stronger stigmatisation on their return to the community since they are often considered tainted by sexual relationships that occurred outside of marriage. They are often ostracised upon return, ridiculed, verbally and physically attacked and prohibited from marrying.
Between 1990 and 2002, female soldiers were involved in internal armed conflicts in 36 countries. In countries such as Angola, El Salvador, Ethiopia, Sierra Leone, and Uganda as many as 40% of child soldiers were female. In Colombia many girls joined armed groups for ideological or financial reasons. Being in with love with an existing soldier is also a common reason cited. In Colombia and Cambodia girls are also often given as “tax payment” by parents. While serving as part of a fighting group is a traumatic experience for any child, the gender of the child must be taken into account in order to ensure that both males and females get effective help. Local anecdotes suggest that females are often referred to as “wives”, “rewards for soldiers’ valor”, or victims of social terror. Other common roles include spies, porters, or minesweepers.
A 13-year-old fighter from Honduras reports:Later I joined the armed struggle. I had all the inexperience and the fears of a little girl. I found out that girls were obliged to have sexual relations to alleviate the sadness of the combatants. And who alleviated our sadness after going with someone we hardly knew?
Health and psycho-social effects after reintegration.
Evidence has shown that female soldiers are released (as part of a DDR program) at lower rates than male soldiers. Many female child soldiers suffer from a variety of health effects including pregnancy and birth complications, vaginal and cervical tearing and sores, and those relating to gender inequalities such as poorer health care, heavier workloads, and less freedom. Other health effects include STDs and HIV which may be passed down during pregnancy, childbirth or breastfeeding. The consequences of pregnancies depend on the practices of the armed group concerned. Females could either be encouraged to carry the pregnancy, to create future fighters or be forced to abort. After childbirth female soldiers are often required to give their child to peasants to raise, to be reclaimed when he or she reaches fighting age.
During reintegration many female former child soldiers experience a variety of negative psycho-social effects. For example former Sierra Leonean female child soldiers were more likely to experience depression, anxiety, and lowered self-confidence than their male counterparts. Reintegrated females often do not desire to enter into any marital relationships, sometimes choosing to withdraw from men altogether. This often results in further social stigma and increased societal isolation. Female child soldiers may be additionally stigmatised by their family or community for having had sexual relations and/or children out of marriage. They may not want to participate in DDR programmes as this would draw attention to their association with an armed group. DDR programs can also be too militarised to attract female enrolment; for example by failing to provide childcare, women's clothes or sanitary supplies.
Case studies.
Colombia.
The Colombian armed conflict involves a number of groups including the Colombian government’s National Army, guerilla groups (such as the National Liberation Army and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), and paramilitary groups such as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. In 2004 Colombia ranked fourth for the highest use of child soldiers in the world. there are about 5,000–14,000 children in armed groups in the country (Watchlist 2004, Watchlist 2012). Current DDR programs in Colombia are carried out by the Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) and have focused on a post-conflict framework. Former Colombian child soldiers reported the most difficult parts of reintegration as being the transition from rural to urban life, reuniting with their families, and being removed from a context of organised armed violence.
Existing DDR programs in Colombia predominantly focus on protecting former soldiers from each other, rather than addressing the fear and stigma that each group suffers. Many in Colombia have viewed the services granted under DDR programmes as granting impunity to these individuals for former crimes. Instead, advocates have pushed for a public awareness through campaigns and advocacy in order to eliminate existing stigma (Thomas 2008).
Sierra Leone.
Sierra Leone endured a civil war from 1991 to 2002. Child soldiers played a key role in the Revolutionary United Front and a lesser role in government forces and various militias. UNICEF states that during this period 84,666 children were officially documented as missing. The conflict seemed to come to an end with the signing of the Lome accord in 1999, but fighting did not cease until 2000. The disarmament and demobilisation portions ended in January 2002.
The rehabilitation and reintegration process focused primarily on community-based solutions. The main goal was to reunite children with their families. To this end a number of Interim Care Centers (ICCs) were established and administered by child protection NGOs. These ICCs sought to serve as temporary stops for children while their families was identified. 98% of demobilised children were reunited with one or both parents, older siblings or extended family. ICCs kept children for no longer than six weeks before returning them to family or foster care. ICCs began the process of rehabilitating former child soldiers into society. They separated them from the command structures that dominated much of their lives re-accustomed them to domestic life. This included performing chores, living to a normal schedule, receiving an education, and playing with other children. Notably, the ICCs were not focused on providing formal, western psychotherapy sessions and less than 100 children received therapy.
Reintegration centred on easing former child soldiers back into their communities. Parents and family members were often eager to welcome back children who had been child soldiers. To help them, various NGOs provided local family classes on how to deal with children who had been traumatised by the war. The local community, on the other hand, was less accepting of these children and often attacked aid workers for being associated with child soldiers. This did not apply to children who were part of the pro-government Civil Defense Force, which was widely seen as helpful by local communities. Wider social acceptance is shown in studies to have been crucial in easing trauma for child soldiers. To this end, communities were educated as to the traumas experienced by child soldiers as well as given help to organise traditional cleansing ceremonies. Additionally, children who were branded with symbols of the groups who abducted them were given plastic surgery to remove scars or tattoos. Beyond this, schools received additional funding in order to incentivise the intake of former child soldiers.
92% of the participants in UNICEF’s formal DDR program were males. Former female child soldiers were often not included out of personal shame or due to not being combatants. Many female children were used for sex or married in bush weddings. These marriages tended to keep females isolated and their husbands would often not allow them to engage in rehabilitation programmes. ICCs were often separated by gender leading to female former child soldiers reporting instances of harassment or assault by males.
South Sudan.
The Second Sudanese Civil War (1983–2002) was fought between the central Sudanese Government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army (SPLA). In 2005 a comprehensive peace agreement (CPA) was signed by both parties. The immediate release of all child soldiers was supposed to occur after the signing of the CPA, but this did not occur. Some, but not all, child soldiers were released from the SPLA. DDR policies were developed to help former soldiers and create a more stable infrastructure aimed at ensuring safety for the future. Creating the DDR policies was difficult because neither the government nor the SPLA shared the numbers or demographics of their soldiers.
Child soldiers were labelled a "special group" and in the drafting of the interim disarmament demobilisation and reintegration programme (IDDRP) they were given special protections. After the signing of the CPA policy-makers began working on a multi-year DDR program. The DDR programmes included health checks, education opportunities, employment opportunities, bundles of supplies, and other services. After DDR began to be implemented it was discovered that most of the people who were being chosen to participate were not actually active members of the military. Therefore many of the people who had left the ranks of the military were being drawn back in order to take part in the DDR program. Largely the DDR efforts for child soldiers in South Sudan failed, mainly due to remaining tensions and a likelihood of continued war.
In 2013, the conflict resumed in South Sudan after the president and vice-president declared war on each other. the war is still ongoing. In 2015 there were a reported 16,000 children being used by armed groups in South Sudan. Due to the armed conflict, in 2015 more than half of elementary- and primary-school-aged children were not receiving an education. Researchers have argued that education is vital in preventing re-recruitment, but accessing education is difficult for demobilised former child soldiers because of the effects of war, socioeconomic status, and a lack of educational structures. Children in South Sudan who have participated in or been involved with the conflict report feelings of isolation, stigma, and exclusion.

Société de l'Ouenza

The Société de l'Ouenza was an Algerian iron ore mining company founded in 1913 and nationalized in 1966.
It exploited rich deposits of high-quality ore at two sites in northeast Algeria near the Tunisian border.
The ore was sent by rail to the port of Bône, then shipped to refineries in the UK, Europe and North America.
At its peak it employed 4,000 workers who were housed in company towns.
Ore deposits.
Djebel Ouenza and Djebel Bou Khadra are isolated massifs near the border between Algeria and Tunisia, Their peaks are from high.
Since ancient times it has been known that the limestone formations contain large seams of iron ore.
The iron ore was rediscovered in recent times by a prospector named Wetterlé who had migrated to Algeria after his home province of Alsace-Lorraine became part of Germany in 1871.
He was looking for copper, a much more precious metal, and had little interest in the mountain of iron ore he stumbled upon.
The Djebel Ouenza deposit, southeast of Bône (now Annaba), extends for more than from northeast to southeast, with over 100 million tons of red hematite formed by metasomatism.
Iron concentration ranges from 50% to 60%, and there is about 2% manganese.
The ore outcrops are suitable for open pit mining.
Djebel Bou-Khadra is west of Morsott and south of Djebel Ouenza.
It has similar origins, structure and composition, and extends for over with at least 23 million tons of ore.
The low-phosphorus ore from both deposits is excellent quality, with 54% iron on average.
Early disputes.
Rising iron ore prices at the start of the 20th century caused interest in exploiting the Ouenza deposits.
The prospector F. R. Pascal obtained a concession to mine underground deposits of copper and iron at Ouenza in 1903.
Pascal did not have the resources to develop the concession, which he ceded through an intermediary to Eugène Schneider of Le Creusot.
Schneider 's main competitor was the Rotterdam-based company of W. H. Muller and Co.
Muller was mainly involved in shipping, and supplied ore to the German steel producers up the Rhine including Krupp.
In 1902 Pascal revoked his agreement with Schneider and ceded it to Muller, who created the Société concessionnaire des Mines de l'Ouenza in 1903.
Schneider then applied for a lease for the "minière", or exploitation of the above-ground outcropping, which he was granted in 1903, and formed the Société d'Études de l'Ouenza, owned 2/3 by Schneider and other French steelmakers, and 1/3 by British, Belgian and German steelmakers – including Krupp.
The two rival companies thus had superimposed concessions.
There then ensued an argument over the railway to carry the iron ore to the coast.
The existing narrow-gauge Bône-Tébessa line did not have the capacity to carry the ore from Ouenza in addition to phosphates from Tébessa region.
The shortest distance and easiest terrain for a new line would be from Ouenza to Nebeur in Tunisia, which was connected by rail to the port of Bizerte.
Ships supplying coal to the French naval base there could carry the ore on the return journey.
On the other hand, Bône was nearer to Ouenza and there would no need to expand the capacity of its port.
The deciding factor was that Bône was in Algeria, and a purely Algerian (French) route was favored by the premier Georges Clemenceau and other leading politicians.
The government proposed a law to let Schneider build the railway to Bône, but ran into opposition from various sources including socialists and syndicalists. 
In March 1909 the government withdrew the proposed Bône railway law, and immediately there were howls of protest from Algeria.
In the end, the initial concessions expired on 10 April 1913 before any work had started.
Concessions.
The Société de l'Ouenza was created in 1913 with capital of 114 million francs to exploit the Ouenza iron deposits.
Under the convention of 16 October 1913 the Société de l'Ouenza had the right to exploit both surface and sub-surface deposits at Djebel Ouenza until completely exhausted, with a minimum annual rate of extraction of 750,000 tons of ore, in return for royalties to the state of 1 franc per ton plus 50% of profits and payment to the railway of 6 francs per ton for transport to Bône.
The articles of the Société de l'Ouenza as a "Société Anonyme" were approved in January 1914, and the company was granted the full concession on 28 March 1914.
A lead and zinc mining concession at Bou-Khadra was granted in 1903 to the Société Mokta El Hadid.
This expired unused on 1 April 1913.
New requests for the concession were presented in 1917, but due to the upheavals of World War I 1914–18) nothing was done.
The opening of a standard gauge railway from Oued Keberit to Souk Ahras and availability of more powerful tractors made the Bou-Khadra deposit more attractive in 1920.
Both the Société Mokta El Hadid and the Société de l'Ouenza asked for the concession.
The Société de l'Ouenza made the better offer and on 29 August 1925 was granted the concession, including iron ore, lead and zinc.
Similar royalty terms applied to the Djebel Bou-Khadra deposits.
Facilities.
At both mines the ore was mostly extracted through open pit mining, and only occasionally through underground galleries.
The ore was extracted using pneumatic hammers.
It was hauled up to the railroad by electrical machinery using power supplied by the Bourbonnais Power Station at Bône.
In the port of Bône the company had a quay and room to store 450,000 tons of ore.
The ore was dumped into a hopper from which it was loaded into ships by three identical conveyors, each able to handle 600 tons per hour.
Production grew to 1,000,000 tons in 1930.
At peak operation there were 400 Europeans working as managers and technicians and 3,500 Muslim workers.
There were 20 armed guards at the Ouenza mine.
The workforce was recruited from the local people and from migrants from El Oued, Petite Kabylie and Morocco.
During World War II the company employed 230 Italian prisoners of war.
In 1943 all the unskilled workers were Muslims.
They worked an 8-hour day and received a salary, family allowances and attendance bonuses.
Managers and office workers had different salaries for 40-hour and 48-hour work weeks.
At both mines the company built small towns with workers' housing, shops, offices and schools.
In Ouenza there was a modern medical center, bank, hotel and post office. 
Water was supplied from D'hala.
Both Europeans and Muslims were lodged and given access to electricity and water.
A school with six classes taught 200 pupils.
The medical center had a chief medical officer and an assistant doctor, a midwife and nurses.
There were Catholic and Protestant pastors, and a mosque for the Muslims.
The cinema played films twice a week.
There was a sports field, two tennis courts, two Moorish cafes and a cafe-hotel.
History.
The government took over the Bône-Guelma line and widened it from Souk Ahras to the Ouenza and onward to Tebessa.
A narrow-gauge railway from the Djebel Ouenza mine to the Algerian railway network at Oued Keberit station was opened in March 1921 and mining began.
Production reached 225,000 tons in 1922.
A branch railway line from Bou Khadra to Ain Chenia was opened in early 1929 and mining operations began at Bou Khadra.
The Société de l'Ouenza overtook the Société Mokta El Hadid as the largest mining company in Algeria in 1927.
The Great Depression forced the Société de l'Ouenza in 1932 to ask for a delay in payments to the Algerian government.
Production fell to under 207,000 tons in 1932 and the operation at Bou-Khadra was suspended.
The state took a greater share in the company and assigned two administrators designated by the governor general.
Output began to rise again to 1,000,000 tons or more annually, but as the economic crisis continued the company asked for further revision of the concession terms, and a new agreement was made on 28 April 1937.
A combined minimum of 1,350,000 tons was to be extracted from the two mines, with revisions to the taxes and transport charges.
As of 1 January 1938 all concessionary distinctions between the two mines were eliminated.
The government share increased to almost 28% of capital, and the government was represented by three directors.
Further adjustments to taxes, royalties, transport fees and shareholding were made in the years that followed.
Output peaked at 1,866,000 tons in 1938.
In the prewar period 50% of output went to England, 28% to Germany and only 7.5% to France.
Other customers included Belgium, Italy, Poland, the USA and Canada.
During World War II (1939–45) production fell to 175,000 tons in 1941 and 198,000 tons in 1942.
The Bône port facilities were badly damaged by bombing in November 1942, but it proved possible to build a conveyor from the debris that could load 1,000 tons per hour.
Shipments stopped in 1943.
In 1944 production was 500,000 tons, in 1945 it was 900,000 tons and in 1946 it was 1,225,000 tons.
By 1946 the company employed 2,000 people.
In 1949 the Société de l'Ouenza was one of 20 French companies with capitalization over 5 billion francs.
At 7.7 billion it ranked 10th.
In 1951 the Société de l'Ouenza produced 60% of Algerian iron, 85% in Ouenza and 15% in Bou-Kadra.
That year 2,140,000 tons of ore were produced and 2,057,000 tones were exported.
By this time the company was 66% state-owned.
Algeria became independent in 1962.
The company continued to operate, and in 1963 re-registered in Algeria and declared that it was an Algerian company with headquarters in Algeria.
The company was nationalized by ordinances of 6 May 1966 and 14 July 1966 and the BAREM company was appointed administrator. 
An ordinance of 11 May 1967 transferred the assets, rights and liabilities of BAREM to the Société Nationale de Recherches et d'Exploitation Minières (SONAREM).
Later there was a dispute where the former board of directors of the company claimed some sums owed to it by French, Italian and English companies. 
This was successfully disputed by SONAREM on the grounds that only it could represent the nationalized company.

Temple Ahavat Shalom Northridge

Temple Ahavat Shalom Northridge is a Reform Jewish congregation located in Southern California's north San Fernando Valley community of Northridge, at Chimineas Ave. &amp; Rinaldi Pl. TAS Northridge is affiliated with the Union for Reform Judaism. 
History.
TAS Northridge was established in 1965 as the result of a merger between two other Reform synagogues in the north San Fernando Valley: Temple Beth Torah and the North Valley Reform Congregation. "Ahavat shalom" is Hebrew for "love of peace." Land was purchased to the south of the future path of California State Route 118 (Ronald Reagan Freeway), and a temporary multi-purpose building was erected in 1969. The founding rabbis were Fred Krinsky and Shimon Paskow. They were succeeded by Rabbi Allen Secher, who served from 1967 to 1971 and was the first member of the clergy to introduce multi-media worship to the synagogue experience.
Rabbi Secher was followed in the pulpit in 1971 by Rabbi Richard Leviton, and in 1973 by Rabbi Solomon F. Kleinman. Among Rabbi Kleinman's major accomplishments were the establishment of a preschool and the completion of a sanctuary-social hall complex to coincide with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in 1978. The ark, which contains a Torah rescued from the Holocaust, was designed by artist Joseph Young, who is perhaps best known for designing the Triforium in downtown Los Angeles. One of Rabbi Kleinman's rabbinic interns from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion was Denise Eger. In 2015, Rabbi Eger became the first member of the LGBT community to head the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the professional organization of Reform rabbis in the United States and Canada.
After Rabbi Kleinman retired in 1986, he served as rabbi emeritus until his death in 2015 at age 95. Rabbi Kleinman was succeeded as senior rabbi in 1986 by Jerald M. Brown. Rabbi Brown inspired the building of an education center, introduced confirmation for 11th graders, and initiated Tuesday morning Torah study, which continues to the present day. Rabbi Barry M. Lutz, who became the temple's senior rabbi in 2008 and led congregational trips to Israel and sites of Jewish historical interest in Central Europe, left TAS Northridge in 2017 to pursue other interests. Two interim rabbis followed: Rabbi Liat Yardeni-Funk from January through June 2018, and Rabbi Arturo Kalfus from July 2018 through June 2020. 
On July 1, 2020, Rabbi Rebecca Hoffman became the senior rabbi at TAS Northridge. Rabbi Hoffman, a native of the San Fernando Valley, is a graduate of the University of California at San Diego, where she majored in Judaic studies. She earned a master's degree in education at American Jewish University, and was ordained as a Reform rabbi through Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion. The cantorial soloist is Elizabeth Kerstein, and Rabbi Dalia Samansky is the Religious School director.
Rabbis in the larger Jewish community whose families were members of TAS Northridge and who spent part or all of their formative years at the synagogue are: Liora Alban, Benjamin Berger, Shawna Brynjegard-Bialik, Leah Doberne-Schor, Jason Gwasdoff, Jonathan Klein, Adam Lutz, Dalia Samansky, Lisa Vernon and Rebeccah Birken Yussman. Cantor Rachel Goldman also grew up at TAS Northridge.
Activities.
Temple Ahavat Shalom Northridge is a full-service congregation. Hebrew school, Sunday school, youth choir, and bar and bat mitzvah training are available for children of elementary- and middle-school age. The synagogue youth group is known as TASTY, for Temple Ahavat Shalom Temple Youth. Confirmation is celebrated by students in the 11th grade, who are also invited to take part in an annual educational trip to Washington, DC. 
Social action and adult education programs take place throughout the year. These include Sisterhood, MoTAS (Men of Temple Ahavat Shalom), weekly Torah study, adult choir, a Caring Community to assist congregants who are ill, bereaved or otherwise in need, collection of food items and other goods for deserving individuals or families, periodic blood drives, and a monthly book discussion group.
With social distancing in place since mid-March 2020 due to COVID-19, Hebrew and Sunday school classes, religious services, auxiliary meetings, weekly Torah study and other activities took place remotely via Zoom. By spring 2021, as immunizations increased and the rate of Covid infections in Southern California waned, the temple began to offer outdoor Shabbat services with mask-wearing and social distancing, in addition to live-streaming the services on Facebook. Services inside the sanctuary resumed in July 2021.

Acyl-protein thioesterase

Acyl-protein thioesterases are enzymes that cleave off lipid modifications on proteins, located on the sulfur atom of cysteine residues linked via a thioester bond. Acyl-protein thioesterases are part of the α/β hydrolase superfamily of proteins and have a conserved catalytic triad. For that reason, acyl-protein thioesterases are also able to hydrolyze oxygen-linked ester bonds.
Function.
Acyl-protein thioesterases are involved in the depalmitoylation of proteins, meaning they cleave off palmitoyl modifications on proteins' cysteine residues. Cellular targets include trimeric G-alpha proteins, ion channels and GAP-43. Moreover, human acyl-protein thioesterases 1 and 2 have been identified as major components in controlling the palmitoylation cycle of the oncogene Ras. Depalmitoylation of Ras by acyl-protein thioesterases potentially reduces Ras' affinity to endomembranes, allowing it to be palmitoylated again at the Golgi apparatus and to be directed to the plasma membrane. Acyl-protein thioesterases, therefore, are thought to correct potential mislocalization of Ras.
Known enzymes.
Currently fully validated human acyl-protein thioesterases are APT1 and APT2 which share 66% sequence homology.
Additionally there are a handful of putative acyl-protein thioesterases reported, including the ABHD17 enzyme family. In the lysosome, PPT1 of the palmitoyl protein thioesterase family has similar enzymatic activity as acyl-protein thioesterases.
Structure.
Acyl-protein thioesterases feature 3 major structural components that determine protein function and substrate processing: 1. A conserved, classical catalytic triad to break ester and thioester bonds; 2. A long hydrophobic substrate tunnel to accommodate the palmitoyl moiety, as identified in the crystal structures of human acyl-protein thioesterase 1, human acyl-protein thioesterase 2 and "Zea mays" acyl-protein thioesterase 2; 3. A lid-loop that covers the catalytic site, is highly flexible and is a main factor determining the enzyme's product release rate.
Inhibition.
The involvement in controlling the localization of the oncogene Ras has made acyl-protein thioesterases potential cancer drug targets. Inhibition of acyl-protein thioesterases is believed to increase mislocalization of Ras at the cell's membranes, eventually leading to a collapse of the Ras cycle. Inhibitors for acyl-protein thioesterases have been specifically targeting the hydrophobic substrate tunnel, the catalytic site serine or both.
Research.
Current approaches to study the biological activity of Acyl-protein Thioesterases include proteomics, monitoring the trafficking of microinjected fluorescent substrates, the use of cell-permeable substrate mimetics, and cell permeable small molecule fluorescent chemical tools.

Let's Go (textbooks)

Let's Go is a series of American-English based EFL (English as a foreign language) textbooks developed by Oxford University Press and first released in 1990. While having its origins in ESL teaching in the US, and then as an early EFL resource in Japan, the series is currently in general use for English-language learners in over 160 countries around the world. The series is now in its 5th edition, which was released in 2019, although the 3rd series is still in print.
Development.
The series was written by two (at that time) US-based EFL/ESL teachers and two Asia-based teachers. Ritsuko Nakata gained a BA from the University of California in Los Angeles, and has been involved in ELT for over 30 years, and is currently President of IIEEC, Teacher Training Center for English Teachers of Children, and President of AETC, The Association of English Teachers, based in Japan. Karen Frazier Tsai (cited as Karen Frazier) has 20 years experience of teaching ESL and has worked and travelled throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto (cited as Barbara Hoskins) gained her MA in Teaching English as a Second Language from Northern Arizona University, and had been based in Japan since 1985. Carolyn Graham is the creator of Jazz Chants, which connect the rhythm of spoken American English to the beat of jazz.
According to Nakata:In 1989, I was approached by the senior editor of Oxford University Press in New York asking me about what the Japanese market needed in terms of a new textbook. At the time, the only texts available were ESL texts that were written for students learning English in English speaking countries, so they were not appropriate for our Japanese students who were coming to class just once a week.According to Hoskins:"Let’s Go" has been a remarkably collaborative piece of publishing. It was one of Oxford’s first publishing projects which worked with authors living in different countries. When we first started, I lived in California, Karen Frazier (Tsai) lived in Taipei, Ritsuko Nakata was in Tokyo, and Carolyn Graham was in New York. Back then, we felt quite high tech with our desk top computers and fax machines–there was no internet or email yet!
Titles.
The series is targeted towards an age range of 5–13 years of age (levels beginner to pre-intermediate). The 1st series (Books 1-6) was published in 1990, the 2nd in 1998, the 3rd in 2006, and the 4th in 2011. The lower level "Let's Go Starter" (by Nakata, Hoskins, and Frazier) was first released in 1997, before being replaced by "Let's" "Begin" in later series. Ancillary publications include workbooks for each of the levels, "Let's Go Phonics" (by Jeffrrey Lehman), "Let's Chant, Let's Sing" (by Graham), and "Let's Go Picture Dictionary" (by Nakata, Frazier, and Hoskins). Available resources include teacher books, classroom CDs, teacher vocabulary cards and student vocabulary cards.
Methodology.
The series claims to improve student learning and classroom pedagogy in the following ways:

Şən Azərbaycan

"Şən Azərbaycan" (Azerbaijani Cyrillic: "Шән Азәрбајҹан", ) is a Soviet-era patriotic song about Soviet Azerbaijan that still remains popular in modern Azerbaijan. It was written in 1970 and was sung by Polad Bülbüloğlu, Muslim Magomayev, Shovkat Alakbarova, and , among others.
During the Soviet era, the song was often sung in both Russian and Azerbaijani. After the collapse of the USSR, the Russian lyrics fell out of popularity and are typically no longer sung.
Russian version.
Due to Russian being the "de facto" official language of the Soviet Union, a Russian-language version was produced alongside the Azerbaijani-language version. It is known in Russian as "Мой Азербайджан" (). This version was written by Onegin Gadgikasimov, a Soviet Azerbaijani poet of Russian background. However, it is rarely sung anymore in Azerbaijan following the collapse of the USSR.

Ernest T. Eaton

Ernest T. Eaton (September 11, 1877 – August 23, 1957) was an American educator and politician.
Early life and academic career.
Ernest T. Eaton was born in Atkinson, Maine into a family of English descent, as one of four children to Thomas O. Eaton and Delia Bolster. In 1886, the family moved to Iowa, where Ernest attended Lenox College and the University of Iowa. He began teaching at Oak Park High School in Des Moines, later serving the school system as high school principal and superintendent. Eaton left for Montana in 1902 to become superintendent of Deer Lodge, Montana schools and founding principal of Powell County High School. In 1904, Eaton, his brother Lewis, and two merchants, John Losekamp and Christian Yegen founded a private high school. Eaton left Powell County on January 1, 1906 and was named financial director of the College of Montana. There, he worked alongside Lewis, the institution's president. The Eaton brothers left the College of Montana in 1908, devoting more funding to the reorganization of the high school they had established with the help of Losekamp and Yegen. The school was reopened as Billings Polytechnic Institute in July 1908.
Political career and death.
Ernest Eaton first served in the Montana House of Representatives between 1915 and 1919. He won a third term in 1923, and was elected to the Montana Senate in 1925. He stepped down from the state senate in 1933. The next year, Eaton became lieutenant governor of Montana under Frank Henry Cooney. He was succeeded by Elmer Holt, and later served in the same position between 1941 and 1949, alongside governor Sam C. Ford. Eaton died at the age of 79, on August 23, 1957. He was survived by his wife, Augusta Valiton, whom he had married in 1911, and two children.

Bart FM Droog

Bartelomeus Frederik Maria (Bart FM) Droog (born 18 February 1966, Emmen) is a Dutch poet, anthologist and researcher.
As a poet, Droog performed on stages inside and outside the Netherlands, notably with De Dichters uit Epibreren, a group consisting of the poets Droog and Tjitse Hofman and the musician Jan Klug, which he co-founded. De Dichters uit Epibreren existed from 1994 to 2011; in 2003 they were awarded the Johnny van Doorn Prize for Spoken Literature. Droog took stage in Iran, Armenia, South Africa and many European countries.
In 2002, the city council of Groningen appointed Droog as the first stadsdichter (city poet), for a three year period. In that period he developed the concept of 'De eenzame uitvaart' (The Lonely Funeral): the city poet writes a poem for the deceased without relatives and reads the poem at the funeral. Poets in other cities in the Netherlands and Flanders adopted this idea. Droog was, from 2008 to 2010, also the city poet of his town of birth.
He established the Stichting Nederlandse Poëzie Encyclopedie (Foundation Dutch Poetry Encyclopedia), of which the main goals are to spread Dutch poetry and the knowledge of Dutch language poetry, including through the online Poetry Encyclopedia, the Nederlandse Poëzie Encyclopedie.
From 2013 onwards, Droog also works as an investigative journalist. Subjects he has published about include:

Leila Negra

Leila Negra, the stage name of Marie Nejar (born March 20, 1930), is an Afro-German singer and actress. She began her career as a child film actor in the 1940s, became a singer after World War II, and left performing in the late 1950s to become a nurse.
Family and early childhood.
She was born Marie Nejar in Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany. Her father was a black sailor out of Liverpool, England, who originally came from Ghana; he saw his daughter only a few times. Her mother, Cécilie, was the daughter of a white German woman and a creole man from the island of Martinique. Cécilie was initially disowned by her family on account of her interracial relationship. She concealed her pregnancy from her family and placed Marie in an orphanage when she was born. When Marie was three years old, Cécilie removed her from the orphanage and they moved to Hamburg to be near Cécilie's mother, with whom Cécilie had reconciled. Cécilie, who worked as a musician, bled to death following an abortion when Marie was 10 years old and Marie was then cared for by her maternal grandmother.
Marie grew up in the multi-ethnic Hamburg docklands. When the National Socialists came to power, she was exposed to hostility because of her dark skin. Due to the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935, she was unable to finish her education and instead had to do forced labor in a factory. By her own account, she survived the early years of Nazism with the help of sympathetic people in her community, including the police; later her appearances in propaganda films offered protection.
Career as performer.
Her film career as a performer began as a result of a search instigated by Joseph Goebbels, the German Minister of Propaganda, for black children who could play African natives in various films being made by UFA, which had been taken over by the Nazis in 1933. Nejar first appeared in the 1943 fantasy film "Münchhausen", performing as a black servant with a fan. Only 12 years old when the film was shot, she didn't realize it was propaganda and was happy to have two weeks off school. Soon she had a small role in the comedy "Quax in Africa" (produced in 1943/44 and released in 1947) as the daughter of an African tribal chief.
After the war she performed in films as a singer rather than an actor, including "Dancing Stars" (1952), "Salto Mortale" (1953), "The Sweetest Fruits" (1954), and "Der Schweigende Engel" (1954).
After the war ended in 1945, she worked in the winters at a bar and in the summers as a cigarette girl at a resort. Asked to test a microphone one evening for other performers, she impressed the audience and the musicians with her talent and turned to a career as a singer. It was at this time that she adopted the stage name Leila Negra. Just 20 when she got a contract with a record company, she was promoted as a 15-year-old child star. Over the next decade, she had a number of hit songs, including the title song from the 1952 film "Toxi", which was about the first wave of children born to black Allied servicemen and white German mothers. She was the first to record the Gerhard Winkler song "Mütterlein", which subsequently became a hit for both Frankie Laine and David Whitfield with English lyrics under the title "Answer Me, My Love". She toured with the Austrian singer Peter Alexander as well as with other musicians.
In her mid-twenties, after a career spanning half a dozen films and some 30 songs, she withdrew from performing as Leila Negra. In 1957, she began training as a nurse, which became her career for the remainder of her working life.
In 2007, she published her autobiography, "Mach nicht so traurige Augen, weil du ein Negerlein bist: Meine Jugend im Dritten Reich" (Do Not Look So Sad Because You Are a Little Negro: My Youth in the Third Reich). The title is taken from one of her hit songs from the 1950s.
As of 2015, she was retired and still living in Hamburg.

2018 United States gun violence protests

In 2018, protests against gun violence in the United States increased after a series of mass shootings, most notably at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14 that year. An organized protest in the form of a national school walkout occurred on March 14. March for Our Lives was held on March 24. Another major demonstration occurred April 20, 2018.
Demonstrations.
Rally in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
The anti-gun violence group Never Again MSD, formed and led by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, held a rally on February 17 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which was attended by hundreds of students.
The Fort Lauderdale rally was followed by other protests across the country. On February 19, a group of teenagers staged a "lie-in" outside the White House. Hundreds of students marched to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 20. Students also demonstrated at Florida's Capitol. In Kansas, several hundred high school students protested on February 21.
March 1 NRA-sponsor boycotts.
The students from Parkland, Florida began encouraging companies who partner with the NRA — offering perks or discounts to members — to sever ties with the organization. Over a dozen companies dropped their NRA partnership in the days following.
Enough! National School Walkout.
The Enough! National School Walkout was a walkout planned by organizers of the Students' March, that occurred on March 14, in response to the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. The protest had students, parents, and gun control students leaving schools for seventeen minutes (one minute for each person who died during the shooting) starting at 10:00 a.m. in their respective time zone. The protest was held exactly one month after the Stoneman Douglas shooting. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) supported the student's activism.
An estimated 3,000 schools and nearly 1 million students participated in the protest. Thousands of students gathered in Washington, D.C. and observed 17 minutes of silence with their backs turned to the White House.
At Greenbrier High School in Greenbrier, Arkansas three students elected to receive corporal punishment in the form of two paddlings on the thighs for their participation in the walkout. This required parental consent, and was administered the same day.
Nearly 200 U.S. colleges added their names to #NeverAgain Colleges, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Harvard University, Yale University, Columbia University, and the University of Florida. The colleges would not penalize high school students who face disciplinary action as a result of participating in a peaceful Never Again MSD protest.
U.S. broadcaster Viacom expressed support for the protests, including executive Shari Redstone making a $500,000 donation to March For Our Lives, and all Viacom U.S. cable networks (including MTV and Nickelodeon) suspending programming for seventeen minutes at a time at 10:00 a.m. in each time zone, in solidarity for the walkouts. The company also planned discussion and acknowledgement of the movement in programming and other output by its channels.
March for Our Lives.
March for Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.
Protesters urged for universal background checks on all gun sales, raising the federal age of gun ownership and possession to the age of 21, closing of the gun show loophole, a restoration of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban, and a ban on the sale of high-capacity magazines in the United States. Turnout was estimated to be between 1.2 and 2 million people in the United States, making it one of the largest protests in American history.
Northwestern Senior High School.
On Tuesday, April 10, 2018, hundreds of students walked out of their Miami high school to protest gun violence after four current or former classmates were shot off campus. The students chanted "no justice, no peace" Tuesday and carried "enough is enough" signs outside Northwestern Senior High School. They staged the protest after the weekend shooting deaths of 17-year-old Kimson Green, a 10th-grader who was about to become a member of the National Honor Society, and 18-year-old Rickey Dixon, a former Northwestern student. Two other current or former classmates were wounded. The shooting happened Sunday at an apartment complex in the Liberty City neighborhood, which is plagued by gun violence.
April 20 The National School Walkout.
The National School Walkout occurred nationally on April 20, 2018 which was the 19th anniversary of the Columbine High School massacre. The movement was founded and organized by Lane Murdock of Ridgefield High School. On the day of the walkout, student demonstrators wore safety orange and departed from over 2600 schools to push for legislative action against gun violence.

Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko

The Ukrainian interbrigade company Taras Shevchenko (in Ukrainian "Українська рота інтербригад імені Тараса Шевченка") was a Ukrainian formation, which participated in the Spanish Civil War on the Republican side. It was composed of the Ukrainian citizens of Poland (inhabitants of Galicia and Volhynia), who were members of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine.
Prehistory.
In the public space of Western Ukraine, the Spanish Civil War became the focus of attention in August 1936. Naturally, the Communist Party of Western Ukraine showed the greatest interest in the conflict. Previously, in May 1936, the progressive intelligentsia of the region condemned fascism and expressed general support for Republican Spain at the Lviv Anti-Fascist Congress.
Under similar slogans, in autumn, demonstrations held in Lviv, Lutsk, Stryi, Stanislav, Rohatyn, Rava-Ruska and Ternopil. At the same time, being impressed by the struggle of the Republic, the leopolitan writer Stepan Tudor wrote a song-march "Passionaria".
On September 20, 1936, a meeting of one thousand construction workers held in Lviv, where the participants declared their solidarity with the Spanish people. And then, on October 3, 1936, an evening of workers' poetry held, where the play "Revolution in Spain" was presented.
The fundraising actions in support of the Madrid government were very successful: only in September–December 1936, in Galicia, 45 thousand zlotys were collected. But the main support to the Spanish Republic was provided by the Ukrainian internationalist soldiers.
First Ukrainians in Spain.
The first members of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine arrived in Spain in August 1936. 37 natives of Western Ukraine who worked as miners in Belgium and France came to give support to their Spanish comrades. After them 180 more volunteers from Galicia and Volhynia crossed the Polish-Czechoslovak border and came to Spain. The number of West Ukrainian natives grew to a thousand people, but they did not have their own units. Many interbrigadiers came from the other side of the ocean: 498 volunteers of Eastern European origin came only from Canada, the majority of which were Poles and Ukrainians.
History of the company.
Appearance.
On July 8, 1937, the leadership of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine formed the International Brigade Company named after Taras Shevchenko, which became a part of the XIII International Brigade (also known as the Dombrowski Brigade). According to contemporaries, the company recruited people who were full of heroism and willingness to self-sacrifice. Sometimes it was called a monument to the great Ukrainian "revolutionary poet". The brigade newspaper "Dambrowchik" has published many articles about the soldiers of the company. His first commander was the Belarusian Stanislav Tomashevich, and Pavel Ivanovich, an emigrant from France, who became the deputy commander of the company.
Battle path.
Its battle baptism took place in the Battle of Brunete to the west of Madrid: the Moroccan cavalry was defeated by the Ukrainians and Poles. In addition, they captured francoists' positions under Villafranca del Castillo and Romanillos de Atienza. In those cruel battles the company lost half of its staff.
On the front of Aragon, on August 25, 1937, the Ukrainians broke the defence of the Italians, bursting into the rear and advanced 10 kilometres. In protracted battles, the company soldiers were fighting with enemy forces that surpassed them in number and quality of weapons, often the fighters ran out of ammunition. The company commissar Nazar Demyanchuk (a native of Volinia, who lived in Canada), the brave fighters Vasyl Lozovy, Yosyp Konovalyuk, Valentyn Pavlusevich, Yosyp Petrash distinguished themselves with courage and heroism in these events.
Some prisoners of the Polish jails (Dmytro Zakharuk and Symon Krayevsky, natives of the Stanislav region, prisoners of Dubno prison in Volinia) fled the prison and reached Spain to help their comrades.
The company soldiers were awarded orders by the brigade commanders and the General Commissariat of the Interbrigades. At the end of 1937, the publication of the Ukrainian-language newspaper "Struggle" (the original name "Боротьба") was launched, where Taras Shevchenko's poems and the articles about the most glorious pages of the company were published. For recruits in Albacete the newspaper "News from Western Ukraine" (the original name "Вісті із Західної України") was published.
Last days of the company.
In December 1937 - February 1938, the company fought for Sierra Quemado in a terrible blizzard: at an altitude of 2000 meters, they resisted the attacks during the Battles of Teruel. They managed to capture a large number of falangists' weapons: rifles, cannons, several armed trucks. The brothers Polycarp and Simon Krayevsky themselves smashed the machine gunners, destroying two squads and capturing their positions. In those battles, the company commander Tomashevich, political instructor Demyanchuk, sergeant Seradzky and Polikarp Kraevsky were killed.
In March 1938, on the Andalusian front, the company was surrounded, and despite the never-ending fascists' attacks near Caspe, four times they managed to break out the ring. In those battles, the commander Stanislav Voropai (Voropayev) and political instructor Simon Kraevsky fell. On March 23, her fighters inflicted a powerful blow to the falangists in Lerida (the fighters Mizyurko and Leonchuk distinguished themselves).
In July–September 1938, the company participated in fierce battles on the Catalan (Aragonese) front, having repulsed seven attacks of the fascists on September 2. Shortly after, in the Battles of the Ebro river, the newspaper editors Shyster and Yuri Velykanovych were killed - Velykanovych, who after the death of Shyster took his post, died on September 4, 1938.
On October 28, a farewell march of the International Brigades was held in Barcelona. The Spaniards and Catalans glorified the Ukrainian volunteers who were leaving Spain as their heroes and presented them flowers. The company became famous as one of the most efficient: it always adhered to the "Seek the enemy" rule, made frequent incursions and counter-attacks, and fought skilfully against the tanks.
Homage.
In the USSR, the internationalist warriors were recognized as heroes who honestly fulfilled their international duty. In 1982, a monument to Yuri Velykanovych, as one of the company leaders, was installed in Lviv. In addition, a street was named after Velykanovych (renamed by the authorities in 1991 after gaining independence). On that street, there was a school with in-depth study of the Spanish language.
In May 2015, some vandals cut off the head of the statue. The monument was dismantled for restoration, and then returned to its place. At night, on December 2, 2017, the members of a neo-Nazi group threw the sculpture to the ground, drew on the pedestal the slogan "Down with the Communist!" and left a signature of their gang.
Company's military history formed basis of the artistic novel "And now, and always" (1981) by the leopolitan writer Yuri Pokalchuk. According to his script, the director Victor Kolodniy made a documentary "Rota im. Tarasa Shevchenko" (Ukrtelefilm, 1989), where the formation veterans' interviews were represented.

Tarichaea

Tarichaea (), alternative spellings Taricheæ/Tarichaeae/Tarichee; Tarichese; Tarichess, is the Greek place name for a historic site, formerly situated along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, and mentioned in the writings of Josephus ("Ant". 14.120; 20.159; "The Jewish War" 1.180; 2.252; "Vita" 32, "et al."). Tarichaea was one of the first villages in Galilee to have sustained an attack by Rome, during the First Jewish-Roman War. The village (κώμη) attracted to it the seditious from the outlying regions east of Galilee, who mixed with the local townsfolk and who relied upon some 230 boats on the Sea of Galilee for protection in the event of an assault upon the village. When the village was eventually overrun by the Roman army, the townsfolk surrendered.
Etymology.
In the first few centuries of the Common era, many places along the Egyptian coast had borne this name, , "Tarichéai", this being a Greek loan-word derived from the people's employment in the preservation of fish, or what some called in , meaning, "pickled fish". The name was applied to a site along the coast of the Sea of Galilee, where the townsmen are thought to have occupied themselves in the same trade. Albright thought the name to mean "Fish-curing plants", or in modern parlance, "Fish canneries." Suetonius ("Til". 4.3) mentions Tarichaea and Gamala as being "potent Judean cities" (Latin: "urbes Iudaeae validissimae").
History.
Roman invasion (52 BCE) to 54 CE.
In ca. 52 BCE, Judea was invaded by the Roman governor of Syria, Gaius Cassius Longinus, who fell upon the town of Tarichæa and carried away thirty thousand Jews into slavery.
Roughly one-hundred years later, in the first year of Emperor Nero's reign (54 CE), a stupendous gift was added to Agrippa II's realm, when Nero entrusted him with the government of a certain part of Galilee, Tiberias and Tarichæa.
First Jewish-Roman War (66–73 CE).
In the 12th-year of Nero's reign (66 CE), when war broke out between Rome and the Jews of Judea, Josephus was appointed governor of the Galilee by the Jewish leadership in Jerusalem, and took care to build the wall of Tarichæa, as well as the defensive walls of other towns in Galilee, in anticipation of a Roman assault against these cities.
At that time, Josephus chose Tarichæa for his place of residence. When certain young men of the village Dabarittha had robbed the king's steward of six-hundred pieces of gold, no small number of silver vessels and of many costly garments, at a time when he passed through their region of the country, Josephus retrieved the money and items when they came to him at Tarichæa, secretly hoping to return such items to the king, and withal blamed them for the violence they had offered the king. However, thinking that Josephus was not of like mind with them and that he secretly entertained notions of betraying them to the king who was allied with the Romans, they raised a commotion in all the neighboring cities, saying that Josephus had designs of betraying the people to the Romans. At this accusation, some one-hundred thousand armed men came to him at Tarichæa, which multitude was crowded together in the town's hippodrome (a place that should rather be considered as a race course devoid of monumental construction), and they raised a clamor against Josephus. Josephus' repartee and skill at oration was able to save himself from imminent danger, by suggesting that he had retrieved the money, not to return to the king, but to finish building the wall of Tarichæa. The indigenous people of Tarichæa, numbering then forty thousand, rose up to his defense and prevented his bloodshed. When the people of Tiberias eventually revolted against Josephus, Josephus devised methods to detain many of the city's governors and principal persons (among whom was Justus of Tiberias), having them transported by boats to Tarichæa where they were incarcerated.
With the exception of Jesus ben Shafat and his party who escaped from Tiberias and joined the seditious in Tarichæa, the people of Tiberias received the Roman army into their city and made peace with the Romans.
Outcome of war.
Josephus, in his extensive accounts of the military history of Tarichaea, relates that Vespasian, the acting Roman general in ca. 64 CE, and his son, Titus, having received intelligence that "Tiberias was fond of innovations, and that Taricheae had revolted", were resolved to punish them. From Josephus' account, it follows that the Roman army moved from Scythopolis in the south to Tiberias in a northerly direction. Vespasian and his son, Titus, encamped with three legions at a place called Sennabris (Σενναβρís), south of Tiberias and "easily seen by the innovators," in preparation for the war with the insurgents. Sennabris was situated some 30 stadia (ca. ) from Tiberias. Vespasian's army first subdued Tiberias, before engaging the rebel forces in Tarichaea.
After entering Tiberias, Vespasian sent against Tarichaea four-hundred horsemen and two thousand archers, under Antonius and Silo, to repel those that were upon the wall. Josephus informs his readers that "after the battle, Vespasian held a court-martial in Tarichaea. Making a distinction between the residents and the newcomers whom he considered responsible for the war, he put the question to his staff whether these too should be spared. The verdict was that it would be against the public interest to set them free." By way of a contrivance, Vespasian permitted the residents to take leave only by the road that led to Tiberias, and when they had gone a certain distance, without suspecting anything, the Roman soldiers conducted them into the Stadium that was built in Tiberias. Of these, the aged and useless, numbering some 1,200, were slain by the soldiers at Vespasian's orders. Of the young men, he picked out 6,000 of the strongest and sent them to Nero at the Isthmus, to help in digging the Corinth Canal. The rest of the people, to the number of 30,400, he sold at auction, excepting only those whom he presented to Agrippa and who had come from his own kingdom.
Before the fall of the city, Josephus escaped and continued the prosecution of the war in Jotapata (), until he was captured there.
Geographical location.
The location of Tarichæa has been the subject of intensive debate; scholars not readily agreeing with each other on the site's location.
Josephus'description.
Josephus frequently refers to a wealthy Galilean town, destroyed by the Romans in the Jewish War (66-73 CE) that has the Greek name "Tarichæa" from its prosperous fisheries. Josephus does not give a Hebrew name.
Josephus places Tarichæa along the shores of Lake of Gennesaret, 30 stadia from Tiberias, and places Gamala "over against Tarichæa, but on the other side of the lake." Josephus adds that while Gamala belonged to the Lower Gaulonitis, Tarichæa belonged to Lower Galilee. Another geographical feature of Tarichæa, according to Josephus, was that it was situated at the bottom of a mountain, and where there was also a plain before the city.
When Vespasian "was informed that Tiberias was fond of innovations, and that Taricheae had revolted," he and his son, Titus, came from Scythopolis and encamped with three legions at Sennabris (Σενναβρís - סנבראי), south of Tiberias, at a place "easily seen by the innovators."
Magdala.
W.F. Albright proposed that the Arab village of Al-Majdal (the ancient Magdala) was to be identified with Tarichæa. This opinion is maintained by many scholars today, who, in this way, identify Tarichaea with Magdala. Thus, Migdal Nunayya ("the Tower of the Fish") would be the Hebrew name of Tarichaea ("the industry of salting fish"). It was also known in biblical times for flax weaving and dyeing. Although Josephus does not say if Tarichaea was north or south of Tiberias, he places the city some thirty "stadia" (furlongs) from Tiberias, or what are a little more than , which is approximately the distance from Tiberias to Magdala. Indeed, his description of the war against Tiberias and Tarichaea (cf. "The Jewish War", book iii, chapter ix, § 7), putting Vespasian's camp at Sennabris, taking first Tiberias and then attacking Tarichaea, makes very plausible this position. Josephus, however, points out that Vespasian had left the bulk of his army at the station "Sennabris" when he sent a small contingent of 50 horsemen to make trial of the situation at Tiberias, further north, hoping to bring them under submission before it came to a fight. When the people of Tiberias welcomed the Roman army, and offered them their hands in peace, the army was then free to engage the rebels at Tarichaea. Given these difficulties, Albright himself recognised that "it may safely be said that the question of the exact site of Taricheae is the most complicated topographical problem in Palestine."
In 1878, H.H. Kitchener of the Palestine Exploration Fund suggested that the citadel of Tarichæa was to be identified with the ruin "Khurbet Kuneitrîah", between Tiberias and Al-Majdal, northwest of Tiberias. He retained that the "town itself was probably on the plain to the
north, along the seashore, where there are traces of ruins and springs of water".
The main problem for this identification is that Magdala is in the west of the lake of Gennesareth, north of Tiberias, while Pliny the Elder places Tarichaea in the south of lake: The lake "is skirted by the pleasant towns of Julias and Hippo on the east, of Tarichea on the south (a name which is by many persons given to the lake itself), and of Tiberias on the west, the hot springs of which are so conducive to the restoration of health" (Naturalis Historia V:27).
Another difficulty has been pointed out by archaeologist Mordechai Aviam, who admits that during the archaeological excavations conducted at the site "no remains of fortifications or a destructionlayer were found", against what Josephus says of Tarichaea. Nevertheless, the same Aviam maintains that could be due to the fact that the walls "had been built with no deep foundations and in a very simple way" and therefore they "were taken apart either at the commandof the Romans or when the towns and cities grew many years after the war", and therefore he maintains the identification of Magdala and Tarichaea
Sennabris (Khirbet Kerak - Malahha - Kinneret Moshava).
Pliny the Elder, in his "Natural History", placed Tarichæa to the south of the Sea of Galilee, while Tiberias is to the west of the lake.
Accordingly, the German traveller, Ulrich Jasper Seetzen, described Tarichaea in 1806 as being on the banks of the Sea of Galilee at its "southward extremity," near the town of Sennabris, saying that some ruins and some walls were still visible, and that the place still bore the name of "el-Malahha", or "Ard-el-Malahha", which is equivalent with the Greek name of Tarichæa, a name derived from the Greek word "tarichos" (salted fish). Seetzen surmised that the inhabitants of Tarichæa made use of ground salt that was plenteous in their town to cure the quantities of fish produced by the lake. Seetzen described the plain which he saw, directly upon leaving the vicinity of "el-Malahha" towards its south, southwest: "Here begins the beautiful plain of "el-Ghôr", which greatly resembles the plain of "el-B'kaa", between Anti-Libanus and Libanus, only that the two chains of mountains that surround it are not so striking as those of "el-B'kaa"." This plain would be the one described by Josephus as stretching in front of Tarichaea. The Arabic place-name can be spelled el-Malaḥa, Mallâha.
Still in the 19th century, Robinson suggested that Tarichaea was Kerek, a place situated to the south of Tiberias. This opinion was followed by almost all 19th-century authors, Conder, C.R., W.M. Thomson, and E. Schürer, among others. Victor Guérin thought that Tarichaea was to be placed either at "Kh. el-Mallaḥa" or "Kh. Kerak", both, south of Tiberias. Archaeologist and historian Nikos Kokkinos proposed that Tarichaea was to be sought somewhere between Kinneret-Moshava and Qevutsa, or what is 1 to 1.5 km north and north-west of "Tel Bet Yerach".
One of the arguments advanced by Kokkinos for locating Tarichaea south of Tiberias is that the Roman army was encamped at the station called "Sennabris", a place "well within view () of the rebels" ("The Jewish War" iii.443). Had Tarichaea been situated at Magdala or at "Khurbet Kuneitrîah" to the north of Tiberias, as opined by W.F. Albright and by H.H. Kitchener, respectively, the rebels could not have seen the Roman army encampment at Sennabris, to the south, since this place is completely obstructed by the intervening hills.
The difficulty with these identifications is that some historical geographers have reasoned that the movement of the Roman army would have proceeded from a southern to northerly direction, without breaking-off the movement. According to Josephus, Vespasian arrived from the south (Scythopolis) with his troops, and pitched his camp at Sennabris (a place near "Khirbet Kerak"). If Tarichaea indeed lay to the south of Tiberias, it seemed inconceivable that it would be bypassed by the Romans, without being dealt with first, while "en route" to Tiberias.
However, according to Kokkinos, this view would not take into account military stratagems, if they indeed existed, such as reconnoitering the Roman army to a place further north (Tiberias) where insurgents were also known to be, and to prevent their sallying-out to their brothers' defence in the south, and only afterwards to engage the enemy in the south (Tarichaea). Kokkinos, citing "The Jewish War" 3.462 and 4.11, suggests that, after the Roman army had subdued and secured Tiberias, Vespasian moved the remainder of his troops to Ammathus, one biblical mile south of Tiberias, where there are hot springs and where he could refresh his troops. Securing this site was deemed a strategic necessity, as it prevented those insurgents who fled from seeking refuge in Tarichaea. Had Tarichaea been situated to the north of Tiberias, moving the Roman army to Ammathus would not have prevented insurgents from escaping to the rebel stronghold. When Tarichaea was eventually subdued, it was from Ammathus also that the Roman army launched its attack against Gamala, opposite the lake.

Ornstein and Smough

Ornstein and Smough are a duo of interconnected characters from the action role-playing game "Dark Souls". Independently known as Dragon Slayer Ornstein and Executioner Smough, they are mentioned in the lore of every game in the series, but are predominantly known for their appearance in "Dark Souls" as an asymmetrical boss fight considered one of the game's most difficult. Ornstein being one of the Four Knights of Gwyn who formerly hunted dragons, and Smough an executioner of superhuman size, they were assigned to protect the Lordvessel from intruders and function as the final bosses of the Anor Londo level. The boss battle has been called one of the most memorable fights in gaming by critics, and has also become notorious for the variety of unusual control devices fans have used to beat it, such as voice commands.
Characteristics.
Ornstein and Smough possess vastly different physical traits. Ornstein is slightly larger than human-sized, extremely fast and wields a spear, while Smough is several times taller than a human, wields a tremendous hammer, and walks slowly unless he is charging. Both of them wear golden armor which emphasizes their height - Ornstein's helmet is leonine with a hole in the mouth, while Smough's armor distorts his muscular body into an obese figure with a cherub-like face, although he sees out of the neck. 
Both of the characters are fought in a long, rectangular and empty cathedral, with parallel sets of pillars on either side. The player can either attempt to block Smough with the pillars while attacking Ornstein, or attack Smough while dodging Ornstein, a more difficult task when alone. If Ornstein is defeated first, Smough crushes him with his hammer, and gains the power of lightning. If Smough is defeated first, Ornstein suddenly grows to immense size while retaining his former speed. When the second boss is defeated, the player can purchase the armor of that boss, and in Ornstein's case, obtains the Leo Ring.
A boss identical to Ornstein appears in "Dark Souls II", called the "Old Dragonslayer", although this fight has been criticized as a "carbon copy" that lacked creativity. Ornstein's spear can be created from the soul of the Old Dragonslayer, and the boss drops the Old Leo Ring, though no other items related to the duo appear in "Dark Souls II". The armor and weapons of both Ornstein and Smough, as well as the Leo Ring, return as usable equipment in "Dark Souls III".
Fictional biography.
Dragon Slayer Ornstein is a member of the Four Knights of Gwyn, an elite personal guard to Lord Gwyn, the primary god of the "Dark Souls" universe. Loyal to Gwyn since the dawn of the Age of Fire, he has an elemental affinity with lightning, which he used to slay dragons using his cross spear weapon. He shows respect for Smough, calmly absorbing his soul if Smough is defeated.
Executioner Smough is an indiscriminate executioner with immense physical strength, though his psychological instability and cannibalistic tendencies prevented him from ever being truly inducted into the Knights of Gwyn. Smough is also disliked by Kingseeker Frampt, a primordial serpent and close friend of Lord Gwyn, who only offers a single soul in exchange for feeding him the Soul of Smough.
When the gods fled Anor Londo, both warriors saw it as an immense honor to guard Gwynevere, daughter of Lord Gwyn and Queen of Sunlight, unaware of the fact that she was an illusion.
Development.
The name of Dragon Slayer Ornstein was likely based on the composer Leo Ornstein. Smough's armor was designed to appear as though it was created by a demented person, reflecting his personality, and he was designed first, with Ornstein being introduced much later in development. Creator Hidetaka Miyazaki forced the game's designers and programmers to make Smough's armor a player-equippable reward, making them "really angry".
Alex Wiltshire of "Kotaku" noted that Smough suffers from a bug to his weapon's hitbox, in which his weapon can still deal damage after the mid-boss cutscene starts and Smough moves to a different location, which has resulted in the deaths of the characters of speedrunners. The bug was not fixed in "Dark Souls Remastered".
Reception.
Several critics consider the Ornstein and Smough encounter to be one of the most memorable or significant boss fights in video games. IGN staff ranked it number 15 in their list of the most unforgettable video game moments of all time, with Chiloi Rad calling it the "singularly defining encounter in the whole of the first "Dark Souls"". Chris Carter of "Destructoid" concurred, noting he was not initially prepared for the challenge and was forced to retreat after he realized that Ornstein became larger upon Smough's defeat, eventually prevailing over the bosses in the reverse order after a "soul draining" encounter. "GamesRadar+" called the fight the third best in the entire "Souls" series, behind Sif and Knight Artorias, stating that it induced a "roller coaster of emotions" that was "the "Dark Souls" experience distilled into one fight". Joe Donnelly of "PC Gamer" also called the duo one of the best "Dark Souls" bosses, and "one of the series' most epic showdowns", adding that "my own inability to topple them keeps me coming back for more".
Dave Cook of "VG247" called the "feeling of jubilation" when he beat Ornstein and Smough "unmatched in all my years as a gamer", also praising the "Dark Souls" community for helping him to defeat the bosses. Mark Serrels of "Kotaku" called the fight "perhaps the most notorious boss battle in "Dark Souls"", and stated that he felt "pure zen" when he beat it, confident that he was going to win after many repeated attempts. Matthew Byrd of "Den of Geek" stated that the difficulty of fighting the bosses makes the player question why they must "suffer through a trial that has so clearly been designed to make you overcome unfair odds", saying that they are especially representative of the core appeal of "Dark Souls". Derek Swinhart of "Game Informer" noted that Ornstein and Smough "have become referenced far outside of their origins", adding that the fight "remains challenging and incredibly satisfying years later, and even veteran players can't let their guard down".
Dragonslayer Ornstein was modded into "Darkest Dungeon" as a playable character by a fan.
Unusual control methods.
Fans of "Dark Souls" have beaten Ornstein and Smough using many non-standard control devices. Benjamin "Bearzly" Gwin beat the bosses using one hand on his controller, a "Rock Band" guitar and drum controller, a "Donkey Konga" bongo drum controller, and voice control. Separately, "Twitch Plays Dark Souls" beat the bosses after 28 days, using a voting-based system for the stream's viewers to choose controller inputs.

Midi E 3301

Midi E 3301 was a prototype electric locomotive of Class E 3300 designed for the Chemins de fer du Midi, France. Because of poor performance, it was refused by the Compagnie du Midi and was re-deployed to Swiss railways. On 1 May 1919, it was classified Fb 2/5 11001 and, in 1920, it became experimental locomotive Be 2/5 11001 of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB).
Overview.
Many lines of the Midi network being mountain lines, the company began an electrification programme in 1909. The system chosen was single phase alternating current at 12 kV and 16⅔ Hz.
Six prototype locomotives were ordered for the Perpignan - Villefranche-de-Conflent line. They were:
The E 3301 locomotive was expected to perform the following tasks:
Technical details.
The companies SLM Winterthur and Brown-Boveri built the E3301 locomotive in 1910-1911. Power was provided by two large Déri repulsion motors that filled almost the entire engine room. The speed and direction of the motors were controlled by brush-shifting, allowing the train to start without jolting. The motors were powered at 1,250 V by two traction transformers connected in parallel. The power of the motors was transmitted to the central axle by two inclined rods, without gears, then to the other drive axles by coupling rods.
Trials.
The E 3301, equipped with auxiliary transformer windings for 15 kV operation, was tested on the Spiez - Frutigen line. During these tests, some design faults became apparent. On 18 February 1912, the locomotive was transferred to Perpignan and trials continued until 16 August 1912. The locomotive was unable to deliver the required performance, as was the case for two other machines. Another gave partial satisfaction, but only E 3201 was fully satisfactory. The Midi also ordered railcars E ABD 1 to 30, which became Class Z 4900 of the SNCF.
Modifications.
The Midi returned the locomotive to its makers, who used it as a test vehicle for individual axle drive. This had already been used for moderate powers and speeds, but experience was lacking for the transmission of higher powers. One motor was connected to an axle through a Tschanz drive. The second motor was connected to an axle through a BBC-Buchli. The third driving axle was left unpowered. As a result, the wheel arrangement changed from 1C1 to 2Bo1. Similar tests were done later on the SBB-CFF-FFS Ae 4/8.
Service in Switzerland.
The modified locomotive was first tested on the Lötschberg railway line. On 1 August 1918, it was officially handed over to the Bern–Lötschberg–Simplon railway (BLS) under number 2B1 10001 for the start of the tests.
Until 1919, the machine was used to haul passenger trains on the Thun - Spiez line. On 1 May 1919 it entered permanently the service of the SBB under the number Fb 2/5 10001. From the energizing of the line from Berne - Spiez on 7 July 1919, it began to haul passenger trains. By the end of 1919, it had travelled 24,500 kilometres. In 1920, when it became Be 2/5 11001, it travelled a further 5,500 kilometres and, by 1921, the total was 35,300 kilometres. Around this time, the locomotive was nicknamed "Viktor".
SBB were receiving new and better locomotives, so they looked for a new assignment for "Viktor". On 1 June 1922, it was assigned to the Erstfeld depot to haul trains on the Erstfeld - Arth - Goldau and Erstfeld - Lucerne lines and covered an average daily distance of 224 km. Between 1923 and 1924, it also pulled passenger trains on the Gotthard line between Lucerne and Bellinzona. In 1924 it travelled only 2,000 kilometres, apparently because of accident damage.
In 1925, "Viktor" was transferred to the Lucerne depot and hauled trains to Rotkreuz (in the Canton of Zug), Zurich and Arth-Goldau and still travelled 202 kilometres daily average. Also in 1925, the train-heating boiler was replaced by a 1,000 volt electric train supply. From 1 October 1926, its use declined and it was used only occasionally on short freight trains. In May 1927, traffic to Rotkreuz and Arth-Goldau increased and "Viktor" was put back into service and travelled 135 km every day.
On 15 May 1928, the locomotive Be 3/5 12201 resumed its services and Viktor was relegated to shunting duties at Zurich depot. It covered only about 7,000 kilometres in 1928. In 1929, the mileage dropped to 592 km.
Final years.
In 1929, "Viktor" was converted into a self-propelled welding wagon Xe 1/5 n° 99999 which later became XTe 1/5 n° 99999. It was withdrawn on 17 September 1937 and scrapped in December 1937.

Joey Allaham

Joey Allaham is a New York City businessman and entrepreneur. He founded a number of restaurants in New York including Prime Grill, Prime KO, and others. From 2017–2018, Allaham was a lobbyist for the government of Qatar.
Career.
Joey Allaham was born in Damascus and grew up in a Syrian Jewish family of butchers. They left in 1992 and Joey moved to New York City in 1993.
Allaham became known for his luxury kosher restaurants, especially Prime Grill, which was seen as New York's first high-end kosher steakhouse. Prime Grill was named the city’s top kosher restaurant for eight years in a row by Zagat. Allaham started three other upscale kosher restaurants - Solo (a Mediterranean-Asian fusion restaurant), Prime KO (a Japanese steakhouse), and Prime at the Bentley - as well as Prime Butcher Baker (an Ashkenazi and Sephardic gourmet food store). He founded Prime Hospitality Group, a company that offered kosher catering to resorts. Allaham has managed to collaborate with a number of government and international officials, as well as other prominent business people through his restaurant businesses. 
In 2013, he published "The Prime Grill Cookbook", a kosher cookbook, with David Kolotkin.
Qatar lobbying.
Joey Allaham started helping Qatar make political investments and affiliations with the American Jewish community. Allaham emerged as a prominent behind-the-scenes figure in stateside battles associated with the Gulf crisis and other incidents. Allaham started working with Nicolas Muzin in 2017. According to some sources, Allaham was paid by the Qataris for “introducing Qatari officials to Muzin and to other influential Republicans.” Allaham said he arranged meetings for Qatari officials and “distributed several charitable donations as an introductory show of goodwill,” but did not “lobby any public officials or conduct any public relations work.” In September 2017, "Muzin registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for Qatar."
Joey Allaham’s firm, Lexington Strategies, received funds in 2017 from Qatar firm Blue Fort Public Relations LLC in order to “foster commercial and international investment-related outreach opportunities for private companies and investors from Qatar into the United States.” Allaham succeeded in arranging prominent pro-Israel figures to visit Qatar. Allaham also managed to arrange meetings in the U.S. between Qatari officials and some of Donald Trump’s associates.
In concert with Muzin, "Allaham took the lead in introducing Qataris to prominent American Jewish figures. He offered them trips to Doha, where they could meet with Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other government officials... The outreach to Jewish leaders organized by Allaham has been a small piece of Qatar's campaign to generate goodwill among individuals who may have Trump's ear." American Jewish leaders who accepted trips organized by Allaham or Muzin included Alan Dershowitz, head of the Zionist Organization of America Mort Klein, Malcolm Hoenlein, and Menachem Genack, "a rabbi who is CEO of the Orthodox Union Kosher Division, which oversees certification of thousands of kosher food facilities around the world." In potential violation of the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), Allaham did not register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent of Qatar during the time frame in which he worked for the country.
On June 7, Allaham consequently told "Politico" that he recently cut ties with Qatar, a day after Muzin declared on Twitter that he had stopped working for Qatar. He informed "Politico" "that he would register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he performed for Qatar." Allaham also implicated former Qatari diplomat Ahmed Al-Rumaihi, who he said asked him "lie to the press that Steve Bannon had maliciously created" a lawsuit against him.
On June 15, Allaham retroactively registered with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for Qatar. He listed his clients as the "State of Qatar" and the "Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy," specifying his respective official points of contact for each as Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and the younger brother of the emir, Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
In his disclosures, Allaham reported that, on behalf of Qatar, he paid Mike Huckabee $50,000 for visiting Qatar and donated $100,000 to the Zionist Organization of America (ZOA), half of which was only transferred after the head of the ZOA, Mort Klein, visited Qatar in early January 2018. Allaham said he disbursed this money from $1.45 million paid him for "'community engagement' to benefit Qatar—actions that included making 'charitable contributions and arranging meetings in the United States and visits to Qatar.'"
Allaham singled out for praise the help for Qatar provided by ZOA president Klein, noting in a June 21, 2018 "Jerusalem Post" report that he was "proud of the work that Mort Klein has done... in collaboration with the Emir and other members of the Qatari Royal Family." Klein denied this, however, saying he "never in any way lobbied for Qatar," and noted that the donation to the ZOA was rejected and returned.
Allaham filed his foreign lobbying activities on behalf of the Qatari government with the Justice Department on June 2018, where donations to pro-Israel organizations the Zionist Organization of America and Our Soldiers Speak (OSS) were listed. On June 2018 Allaham disclosed the payments in a filing to register as an agent of a foreign government.

Whitehorse Formation (Canada)

The Whitehorse Formation is a geologic formation of Late Triassic age. It is present on the western edge of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin in western Alberta and northeastern British Columbia. It was first described as a member of the Spray River Formation by P.S. Warren in 1945, who named it for Whitehorse Creek, a tributary of the McLeod River south of Cadomin, Alberta. It was later raised to formation status.
Marine fossils from the Late Triassic epoch including crinoids, brachiopods, bivalves, and gastropods, have been found in the Whitehorse Formation.
Lithology and stratigraphy.
The Whitehorse Formation was deposited on the continental shelf along the western margin of the North American craton. It consists of dolomite, limestone, quartzose sandstone, and siltstone, with minor gypsum.
The Whitehorse Formation is subdivided into the following members:
Distribution and relationship to other units.
The Whitehorse Formation is present in the Rocky Mountains and their foothills from the Canada–United States border in Alberta to the Sukunka River area of northeastern British Columbia. It is disconformably overlain by the Jurassic Fernie Formation and conformably underlain by the Sulphur Mountain Formation. It is correlative with the Charlie Lake, Ludington, Baldonnel and lower Pardonet Formations and, in the subsurface of northeastern British Columbia, the Schooler Creek Group.
Economic resources.
Gypsum.
Although localized deposits of gypsum are present in the Starlight Evaporite Member, they lie within Jasper National Park and are protected from development.

Steven Williams (snowboarder)

Steven Williams (born 15 January 1988) is Argentine snowboarder. He competed in the 2018 Winter Olympics.
Early life.
Steven Williams was born in San Martín de los Andes on 15 January 1988. His father, of Welsh descent was the director of the local ski school. He taught Williams to ski from a very young age, and he spent much of his childhood in the ski resorts of the city. However, his father died when Williams was 13 years old, and decided to start working to help his family.
While he continued skiing after the dead of his father, he soon became bored of it, and decided to switch to snowboard.
Before becoming a professional snowboarder, Williams worked as a firefighter, fishing guide and snowboard instructor.
Sports career.
Shortly after starting snowboarding, Williams began to participate in various Argentine competitions. In 2011 he managed to travel to Europe, where he participated in six tournaments. This allowed him to join the Argentine Ski Federation where he could improve his performance, winning three times the Argentine Championship and one European Cup. He was the South American Champion seven times, both in Argentina and Chile, and in individual tournaments in Ushuaia, Corralco and Bariloche. Later, he reached the Top 10 in the World Championship. He competed in the 2017–18 FIS Snowboard World Cup in Feldberg, Germany.
He was able to qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics at the very last moment, due to reassignment of quotas from the International Ski Federation. With this, he became the first Argentine to compete in Snowboard Cross at the Winter Olympics. Williams managed to advance to the knockout stage, however he was surpassed by only four centimeters in the final straight by the French snowboarder Merlin Surget.
He has show interest in participating in the 2022 Winter Olympics.

Saint Augustine Fire of 1914

The Saint Augustine Fire destroyed every structure in Saint Augustine, Florida north of the Plaza from Saint George Street to the Bay on the morning of April 2, 1914. The fire claimed six hotels, the opera house, the courthouse, and countless homes and businesses.
Origins and firefighting.
The fire began in the kitchen boiler room of Florida House on Treasury Street before daybreak. It was first reported by a patrolman named S A McCormick who saw flames from a second floor window while walking his late night beat shortly after 1:00am. The Florida House was engulfed before help arrived. Fire fighters first worked to rescue guests at the Florida, many of whom were carried down ladders. The local fire department could do no more than contain the fire and summoned help from Jacksonville's fire department, who arrived via the Florida East Coast Railway.
Hotel guests fled neighboring structures in their night clothes into a blaze of light, visible from the outskirts of the city. Clothing, furniture, and belongings rescued from the fire were heaped on the green in front of Fort Marion and on the Plaza, which the owners tried to sort out for days. Due to crowds of refugees and spectators, Mayor A W Corbett called out the militia to prevent looting. Saint George Street was littered with fallen electric wires and the electric light plant was shut down.
Newspapers reported only one fatality caused by the fire. Alice Smith of Amherst, Nova Scotia, leapt from the third floor of the Florida House and was taken to a hospital with a broken back. She did not recover. A man named Libby, another guest of the hotel, leaped from the second floor, and broke his leg. A number of others were less seriously hurt.
"The Bemidji Daily Pioneer" estimated property damage at $500,000 to $750,000. The Keowee Courier estimated damage at $400,000.
Buildings lost.
Atlantic Hotel was on Bay Street beside The Monson and opened in 1910.
Bennett House was at the corner of Bay and Cuna Streets, and opened in 1910.
Central Hotel was at 84 Charlotte, north of Treasury Street. Henry E Hernandez, who later owned the Ocean View Hotel, operated the Central until 1910.
Capo's Bath House was an octagonal-shaped building located on a bay pier near 20 Bay Street across from Baya Lane throughout the Flagler Era. It was owned by Philip V Capo and operated by Adolphus N Pacetty, providing hot and cold sea water, sulfur water baths, and shower baths. It was popular among tourists before access to the beaches was improved.
Florida House was located on 131 Saint George street near the Plaza. It was advertised in Elias Nason's "1884 Chapins Hand Book of Saint Augustine" as featuring 131 large rooms, elegant furnishings, good ventilation, and gas lights. A steam passenger elevator carried guests to the fourth floor. Originally only open in the winter, at the time of the fire the Florida was open all year and the capacity was 250.
Genovar Opera House was on Saint George Street north of Treasury. The theatre hosted traveling companies and had full stage equipment and folding seats. The proprietor was Bartola Genovar, who lost his original Opera House at Charlotte Street and Cuna to a previous fire.
Hotel Clairmont was next to the Opera House on Saint George Street.
Monson House was a wooden boarding house on Bay Street owned and operated by Anthony V Monson and his wife Florence Young. Their original structure burned in an 1895 fire. After 1914, the Monson was replaced by a masonry structure that opened on January 5, 1915, and remained a fixture on Saint Augustine's bay front until 1960.
Saint Johns County Court House was located on the southwest corner of Charlotte and Treasury Streets. It was built in 1907 and burned in 1914. The replacement courthouse was built on its foundations in 1918, and was active until the county government moved into the former Cordova Hotel in 1968.
The Vedder Museum was located on Bay Street at the corner of Treasury and was called "the oldest hotel in America" in a newspaper account of the fire. It was named for Dr John Vedder, who opened a permanent museum for his collection of curiosities and animal specimens in the 1880s. The museum was purchased by the Saint Augustine Historical Society after Vedder's death in 1899. SAHS relocated to the Gonzales-Alvarez House (The Oldest House), which was purchased October 3, 1918. The Vedder was situated next to the bay side entrance to Treasury Street, which was only 6'-1" wide and frequently featured on postcards as "The Narrowest Street in the United States".

American military intervention in Somalia (2007–present)

Beginning in the late 2000s, the United States Military has supported the Federal Government of Somalia in counterterrorism as part of the ongoing Global War on Terror that began in wake of the September 11th attacks. Support, mostly in the form of drone and airstikes, advising, training, and intelligence, increased during the Obama administration and Trump administration, with hundreds of drone strikes targeting the terrorist group al-Shabaab. Two U.S. special operations servicemembers and a CIA paramilitary officer have died during operations in Somalia.
In late 2020, US President Donald Trump announced that he would pull all US troops out of Somalia by 15 January 2021. On January 17th, 2021, the US Military announced that its troop drawdown had completed.
US Airstrikes on Somalia.
Since 2007, the United States military has targeted militant groups, mainly Al-Shabaab, within Somalia using airstrikes including targeted drone strikes and missiles launched from naval ships alongside special forces raids and advising. Airstrikes were ramped up dramatically under the Trump administration and further targeting the Islamic State.
Timeline.
2007.
US forces conducted three strikes in Somalia during 2007 killing a minimum of 21 people including two civilians.
A U.S. Air Force AC-130 gunship operating under JSOC targeted a suspected al-Qaeda convoy. The strike killed various potential fighters including Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, and Sudanese explosive expert Abu Talha al Sudani known as Tariq Abdullah. The convoy had been tracked at night by a MQ-1 Predator drone. An estimated 5–10 militants were killed and 4-5 injured. A joint U.S.–Ethiopian team landed at the strike location shortly after and confirmed at least 8 killed. According to the U.S. Department of Defense, the militants killed in this strike were connected to the 1998 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
Four towns near the southern city of Ras Kamboni were targeted by an AC-130 gunship. The strike which was targeting a training camp and al-Qaeda associates, reportedly left 4–31 people killed. The intended target was thought to be Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, the target of a previous airstrike. Another strike was reported near Afmadow in which 22–31 people were reported killed.
At 4:00 a.m., an AC-130 gunship operating from an airbase in eastern Ethiopia, targeted the town of Waldena in an attempt to kill Ahmed Madobe. Madobe survived the airstrike but was later captured by American and Ethiopian forces who landed by helicopter at 10:00 a.m.
The "USS "Chafee"" fired a dozen rounds and possibly one cruise missile on the coast of Bargal, in northern Somalia. The strikes were targeting 35 militants that had landed on the coast and had begun to fire on local forces. U.S. officials told "The New York Times" that U.S. operatives were on the ground, leading to the American warship firing in self-defense. 8–12 militants, including some foreign fighters were killed.
2008.
1–3 cruise missiles were launched by United States at the town of Dhobley in southern Somalia, four miles from the Kenyan border. The strike was targeting the leader of the Ras Kamboni Brigades known as Hassan Turki, and al-Qaeda member Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan. At the time, Saleh Alii was the subject of a $25 million bounty placed on him by the United States government.
Four cruise missiles launched by a U.S. Navy warship struck a compound in Dhusamareb, in central Somalia. The strike killed senior al-Shabaab leader Aden Hashi Ayro and several other fighters. Reports suggest that an AC-130 was also involved in the operation. The attack purportedly caused al-Shabaab to ban the use of mobile phones by its fighters.
2009.

Mountain View Hotel (Centennial, Wyoming)

The Mountain View Hotel is a historic hotel near Centennial, Wyoming. It was built in 1907 as the railroad arrived in Centennial in the declining years of a gold mining boom. The hotel was part of a community development plan to develop businesses that did not depend on mining. featured 20 rooms and three baths, but the bathrooms were originally located in a separate stable building. The hotel was bought by Gustav and Anna Sundby in 1914, who operated the hotel into the 1940s. In the 1950s the hotel became an apartment house.
The hotel was restored in the 2000s and is once more a hotel. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 7, 2007.

RESF1

Retroelement silencing factor 1 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the RESF1 gene. RESF1 is broadly expressed in the lymph nodes, ovaries, appendix and spleen. RESF1 shows characteristics of being a minor histocompatibility antigen, as well as tumor suppressor capabilities. The high expression in the lymph nodes and spleen indicate function in the immune system.
Gene.
RESF1 is a protein coding gene found on Chromosome 12 and maps to 12p11.21. Alternative names for this gene include Gonad Expressed Transcript (GET), UTA2-1 and C12orf35. RESF1 has 7 exons, 3 of which occur before the start codon.
Tissue expression.
Normal.
A study of normal human tissue expression profiling shows that RESF1 is highly expressed in the thymus, spleen, bone marrow and liver. This is interesting as it relates to common organs associated with the Immune system.
Gene tissue expression patterns found through the National Center for Biotechnology Information UniGene EST Profile showed that there was also high expression of RESF1 in the lymph nodes, uterus, mouth, thyroid, larynx and blood.
Cancer.
An evaluation of RESF1 expression in health states was performed using NCBI Unigene’s EST Profile. Although RESF1 is highly expressed in uterine tumors, it is also highly expressed in the uterus, suggesting that it is unlikely the gene is associated closely with uterine cancer. However, RESF1 may be related to adrenal tumors, as there was lower expression of this gene within normal kidney tissue.
Transcript.
Transcription factor binding sites.
Transcription factor binding sites within the promoter of RESF1 included mainly transcription factors that were associated with bone marrow cells, antibody- producing cells, and blood cells. This supports the association of RESF1 with the functioning immune system.
Protein.
RESF1 is 1747 amino acids in length and has one domain of unknown function, DUF4617. The Molecular Weight of RESF1 is 194.9 kdal. The basal isoelectric point is 8.95. A localization prediction suggests that RESF1 is likely a nuclear protein.
Protein structure.
The secondary structure of RESF1 consists of mainly random coil structures (approximately 59.2%), few alpha helices (24% of residues) and fewer extended strands (15.8% of residues).
A predicted 3-D structure was created using Swiss model work space, shown above.
Protein interactions.
RESF1 interacts with NANOG, MDM2, EXOC1 and CALML3. These interactions further suggest RESF1 is a nuclear protein, and that it may be associated with tumor-suppressor proteins and immune system proteins.
EXOC1 was involved in a schizophrenia study, relating a schizophrenia risk gene (DISC1) to a network of protein-protein interactions. This study used a two-hybrid assay as evidence to the protein interaction between RESF1 and EXOC1. EXOC1 functions as a response to microbial infections, which reduces viral RNA synthesis and protein translation.
NANOG was predicted to interact with RESF1 based on an affinity capture-MS, which linked NANOG to proteins involved with the cell cycle. This study used affinity purification combined with high accuracy mass spectrometry to find specific protein interactions. NANOG was also found to be an essential transcription factor in embryonic stem cells, specifically involved in gene expression to affect cell fate.
MDM2 is a gene that interacts with others to affect the cell cycle and apoptosis, and is located in tissues common to RESF1, such as the uterus and lymph node. MDM2 was found to interact with RESF1 through the use of a phage display library. This interaction further suggests that RESF1 is a nuclear protein, as MDM2 and its splice variants contain nuclear localization signals for nucleoplasmic distribution.
CALML3 was found to interact with RESF1 based on affinity capture-MS assay, similar to how NANOG was found to interact with RESF1. A study on CALML3 expression in epidermal development showed that CALML3 was useful marker for development, and loss of CALML3 expression correlated with malignant phenotypes.
Evolutionary relationships.
Orthologs.
The closest orthologs to RESF1 are primates, however, conserved sequences can be found in whales, bears, snakes, birds, turtles, and frogs. Orthologs of RESF1 diverged as long ago as 353 million years ago ("Xenopus laevis"), while the closest evolutionary ortholog is "Papio anubis", which diverged approximately 28.1 million years ago.
Phylogenetic tree.
An unrooted phylogenetic tree of RESF1 was created of 20 orthologs and the human RESF1 gene.
Molecular phylogeny.
A graph shown below of the molecular evolution of RESF1 shows that it evolved relatively quickly compared to both cytochrome C, a slowly evolving protein, and fibrinogen alpha, which evolved more quickly than cytochrome C. The comparison shows that RESF1 is fairly quickly diverging, which suggests that it could be a gene that changes quickly in response to its environment, such as the introduction of a pathogen.

Kanō Tomonobu

Kanō Tomonobu (, 24 April 1843 – 15 July 1912) was a Japanese painter of the Kanō school. He used the art names Shunsen () and Isseisai ().
Life and career.
Tomonobu apprenticed under the official painter for the "shōgun" (the "oku-eshi") in 1859, at age 16.
On the suggestion of his brother-in-law Kawada Hiromu, the governor of Sagami Province, who had travelled to France as part of a shogunal delegation, Tomonobu studied Western painting at the Foreign Studies Centre for two years beginning in 1863. He then spent three years beginning in 1865 at the school of Kawakami Tōgai, and while there studied with the English artist Charles Wirgman for two years. He helped the American art historian Ernest Fenollosa in his studies of Japanese art and introduced Fenollosa to the painter Kanō Hōgai.
Tomonobu worked at the Ministry of Popular Affairs in 1870. He taught at the University of Tokyo in 1877, the Tokyo University Preparatory School in 1880, the Tokyo School of Fine Arts in 1889.

Alexander Blake Wind (born January 30, 2001) is an American student activist against gun violence. A survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and a founding member of the Never Again MSD movement, he is a critic of politicians who are supported by the National Rifle Association. Wind was one of five Stoneman Douglas students featured on the cover of "Time" magazine in 2018.
Wind was included in "Time" magazine's "100 Most Influential People of 2018." 
In a speech televised internationally at the March for Our Lives protest in Washington on March 24, 2018, Wind criticized people who think that "teenagers can't do anything", and he cited examples of young people from history including Joan of Arc and Mozart. He criticized the idea of arming teachers as a defense against violence, saying that if "teachers start packing heat, are they going to arm our pastors, ministers, and rabbis?" He insisted that young people must vote in the upcoming election. Wind urged people to contact their congresspersons and ask them to declare their stance on gun control and not accept campaign contributions from the NRA, and to petition lawmakers to take steps to end gun violence.
Wind is a member of the drama club of Stoneman Douglas High School, and he was one of the first students to speak out online after the shooting. He promoted the "March for Our Lives" student protest in numerous media interviews. He sang the national anthem before a basketball game featuring the Miami Heat.

Pedro Sánchez de Mathos

Pedro Sánchez de Mathos (c. 1635 - c. 1705) was the first municipal magistrate of Ponce, Puerto Rico, in 1692. He was appointed mayor by the Governor of Puerto Rico, Juan Robles de Lorenzana. He had been "regidor" (a type of municipal councilman) in San German in 1676 and was its mayor in 1688.
He was born around 1635 in San German, Puerto Rico. His parents were Juan Lorenzo de Matos and Catalina Sanchez. In 1686, Sánchez de Mathos owned six slaves, making it likely he was a landowner or cattle rancher and used slave labor to tend to the land or his cattle.
Background.
The difficulty of crossing the Cordillera Central, sometimes taking as long as 37 days, created unique challenges for the Spanish-appointed authorities in San Juan to govern over the entire island. As a result, the island was divided into two political regions—one based in San Juan and a second one based in San German. As years went by the political influence of the "partido de San German" grew to the point that it challenged that of San Juan. To reign in the growing influence from San German and maintain control over the entire island, in 1678-1683, Governor Juan Robles de Lorenzana attempted to establish additional administrative units, called "partidos", carving some of them, including the one for Ponce, out of the San German jurisdiction. The plan was unsuccessful, as the governor's term came to a close and no one was interested in serving as the head of such new "Partido de Ponce". In 1690, a new governor, Gaspar de Arredondo y Valle, sent a letter the Real Audiencia of the Indies in Santo Domingo where he proposed the creation of five new administrative units, including one in Ponce. As the letter went unanswered, in 1692 the governor proceeded to create, not five administrative units, but five military units, which would be headed by a military officer who would function as mayor and have powers for civilian oversight as well. In 1692, during the governorship of Gaspar de Arredondo y Valle, the Spanish Crown officially gave its blessing to the creation of the "Partido de Ponce", but Ponce was already operating with a military commander functioning as a mayor, Pedro Sánchez de Mathos.
Mayoral term.
Given that Sánchez de Mathos was already functioning as Teniente a guerra in the jurisdiction of Ponce since December 1685, the creation of the "Partido de Ponce" was more of an official confirmation of his position than an appointment to a newly created position. Pedro Sánchez de Mathos functioned as mayor until 1701. He received no payment of his service as mayor.

Blood (2004 film)

Blood is a 2004 Canadian drama film directed by Jerry Ciccoritti. Based on the theatrical play by Tom Walmsley, the film stars Jacob Tierney as Chris Terry, a bisexual recovering drug addict and alcoholic who visits his prostitute sister Noelle (Emily Hampshire) for the first time in five years, only to be asked to have a threesome with Noelle and her client.
The film was shot over four days by having Tierney and Hampshire perform the complete play eight times, and then editing to use the best take for each scene. The original play was written for older actors, but Ciccoritti chose to cast Tierney and Hampshire, both of whom he had worked with before, after the actors he had originally planned to cast were unavailable.
The film premiered at the 2004 Toronto International Film Festival.
The film received two Genie Award nominations at the 25th Genie Awards in 2005, for Best Actress (Hampshire) and Best Original Screenplay (Ciccoritti). Ciccoritti also received a Directors Guild of Canada award nomination in 2005.

Hampton Roads Educational Telecommunications Association

The Hampton Roads Educational Telecommunications Association (HRETA) is a consortium of public school districts in southeastern Virginia that holds the licenses for the public television and radio stations in the Hampton Roads television market. It is headquartered at the Public Telecommunications Center for Hampton Roads on the campus of Old Dominion University in Norfolk.
It presently comprises 20 school districts in Hampton Roads and the Eastern Shore of Virginia: Accomack, Gloucester, Isle of Wight, Mathews, Middlesex, Sussex, Southampton, Northampton and York counties, Williamsburg-James City County Public Schools, and the independent cities of Norfolk, Hampton, Franklin, Newport News, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Suffolk and Poquoson.
The stations under its umbrella are Hampton Roads' PBS member station, WHRO-TV (channel 15, Hampton/Norfolk), NPR news/talk/jazz/folk station WHRV (89.5 FM, Norfolk) and all-classical music WHRO-FM (90.3 FM, Norfolk). They also operate numerous repeater stations across Virginia, four of which repeat WHRV and two of which repeat WHRO-FM.
HRETA traces its roots to 1961, when WHRO-TV went on the air as a collaboration between the Norfolk and Hampton school systems. They were joined by the school systems in the independent cities of Newport News, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, Virginia Beach, Suffolk, as well as Nansemond, York and Isle of Wight counties. In 1968, the 10 school boards formed the Hampton Roads Educational Television Associations to operate channel 15. HRETA had its mission broadened to radio in 1975, when it bought then two-year-old WTGM, Hampton Roads' NPR member station. A year later, HRETA was reorganized under its current name, with the "T" now standing for Telecommunications. WTGM changed its call letters to WHRO-FM in 1978. 
As early as 1983, HRETA concluded a second public radio station could be viable. However, it took until 1990 to bring that station online, on 90.3. The new station took over all classical music programming, as well as the WHRO-FM call letters. NPR programming remained on 89.5 under new calls, WHRV.

Microtis cupularis

Microtis cupularis, commonly known as the cupped mignonette orchid sometimes as Hydrorchis cupularis, is a species of orchid endemic to the south-west of Western Australia. It has a single thin, hollow, onion-like leaf and up to thirty small, yellowish-green and red flowers. The plants often grow in shallow water and are self-pollinating.
Description.
"Microtis cupularis" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and about wide. Between fifteen and thirty yellowish-green and reddish-maroon flowers are arranged along a flowering stem tall. The flowers are about long, wide and are self-pollinating. The dorsal sepal is about long and wide. The lateral sepals are about long and curve around the labellum. The petals are a similar size to the lateral sepals and are partly enclosed by the labellum. The labellum is cup-shaped, fleshy and about long and wide. Flowering occurs from September to December.
Taxonomy and naming.
The cupped mignonette orchid was first formally described in 2005 by D.L.Jones and Garry Brockman from a specimen collected near Bull Creek and given the name "Hydrorchis cupularis". The description was published in "The Orchadian". In 2007, Andrew Brown changed the name to "Microtis cupularis". The specific epithet ("cupularis") is derived from the Latin word "cupula" meaning "cup", referring to the cup-shaped labellum.
Distribution and habitat.
"Microtis cupularis" grows in seasonally wet depressions and where water runs of granite outcrops, often growing in several centimetres of water. It is found between Perth and to just east of Esperance.

On 19 June 2013, al-Shabaab, a Somali jihadist organization, attacked a United Nations compound in Mogadishu using suicide bombers, and gunmen who stormed the compound on foot, killing 15 and injuring at least 20. According to the UN, a pickup truck filled with explosives detonated outside the main gate of the compound located near Aden Adde International Airport at 11:30 a.m., which was followed by several gunmen assailing the area on foot, engaging in a gunfight with Somali security forces that lasted an hour and a half. Numerous blasts could be heard as Somali troops fought with at least seven militants.
Four foreigners working for the United Nations Development Programme were killed in the assault, as well as numerous Somali security forces and civilians. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement which called the UN a "merchant of death." It was the first attack on the UN since the organization relaunched its operations in the country.

Elizabeth Swaney

Elizabeth Marian Swaney (born 30 July 1984) is an American born-and-raised freestyle skier who competed for Hungary in the 2018 Winter Olympics in the women's halfpipe based on her Hungarian ancestry. She was unable to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics for Venezuela in both skeleton and freestyle skiing, and qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics in the women's halfpipe, in which she placed last.
Athletic career.
While at University of California, Berkeley Swaney was the coxswain for the men's rowing team. She first thought she would try competing in bobsleigh as a pilot, but was told she was too small to be competitive in the sport. She then turned to skeleton and freestyle skiing, in which she sought to represent Venezuela, her mother's homeland, at the 2014 Winter Olympics. She started skiing for Hungary in 2015, based on her grandparents' country of birth.
Olympic qualifying.
Swaney qualified for the 2018 Winter Olympics representing Hungary in half-pipe skiing. Beginning in 2013 she attended all the World Cup qualifying events over the two Olympic qualifying years, and the 2017 World Championship in Sierra Nevada, Spain. In order to qualify for the Olympics, athletes needed to place in the top 30 at either a FIS Freestyle Ski World Cup event or FIS Freestyle World Ski Championships, and score a minimum of 50.00 FIS points. Swaney achieved this by attending competitions with fewer than thirty participants, with one event in China having fifteen (in which she placed thirteenth). Thirteen of her top 30 finishes were a result of her showing up, not falling, and recording a score. As a result of Swaney's selection of competitions, she was ranked 34th in her run up to the Olympics. The Olympic quota system also aided in her qualifying. While 24 women were able to compete in half-pipe competition, there are limits on the number of skiers each country could send. The maximum a country could send was twenty-six (with maximums of fourteen men and fourteen women) across all freestyle skiing events. So while the United States had six women ranked within the top 20 in the world in halfpipe skiing, only four were allowed to compete in the Olympics based on the quota system. Between the quota system and injuries, Swaney's ranking of 34 granted her qualification for the Olympics.
2018 Olympics.
At the 2018 Winter Olympics, Swaney competed in the women's half-pipe, in what was described as a "perfectly mediocre run", without falling. She scored 30.00 and 31.40, "barely attempting a trick" in either of her two runs. She placed last in the competition, 13.60 points behind Laila Friis-Salling of Denmark, who had fallen in both of her qualifying runs. The incident prompted the Hungarian Olympic Committee (MOB) to reevaluate its selection process, and possible changes to the quota system. As of 2021, no changes have been made to the FIS freestyle ski selection process in halfpipe skiing.
While critics called her Olympic performance a "mockery", she received support from Canadian gold medalist skier Cassie Sharpe, who said, "If you are going to put in the time and effort to be here, then you deserve to be here as much as I do." Gold medalist Maddie Bowman, and David Wise, a double gold medalist, also defended her. Jeff Passan from Yahoo Sports was one of the few to interview Swaney at the games and wrote a piece, "Is Elizabeth Swaney the worst Olympian? Actually, she might be the best."
Personal life.
While studying at University of California, Berkeley (from which she graduated in 2007) she briefly launched a campaign for Governor of California. After graduation she studied for and received a Master's degree at Harvard University. While at Harvard she volunteered as the assistant coach for their Track and Field team.

The 2005 El Mreiti base attack occurred on 4 June 2005 when militants from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat, a predecessor group of AQIM, attacked a remote army garrison in western Mauritania, killing eighteen government troops and capturing a significant amount of weapons. According to a statement released by militants, the attackers surrounded the base and engaged in a battle that lasted several hours, eventually breaching the base, seizing large quantities of weapons and ammunition, and fleeing. The same statement claimed that fifty Mauritanian troops had been killed in the assault. Five GSPC militants, all Algerian nationals, were killed during the battle. The attack was led by Mokhtar Belmokhtar, an Algerian jihadist and veteran of the Soviet–Afghan War. It was one of the first al-Qaeda linked operations to occur on Mauritanian soil and spurred the government of Mauritania to ally with Algeria and Mali in a bid to root out militants in the region.

2008 attack on the Israeli embassy in Mauritania

On 1 February 2008, at least three gunmen who allegedly belonged to the Islamic terrorist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb opened fire outside the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania. Armed with rifles and grenades, they injured three bystanders. Eight suspects were later arrested.
Attack.
On 1 February 2008, several unidentified gunmen attacked the Israeli embassy in Nouakchott, the capital of Mauritania, in a gun and grenade attack. At 2:20 am local time, between three and six gunmen dressed in turbans and robes approached the embassy building on foot after being dropped off by a car at a close by nightclub and opened fire, shouting "Allahu akbar." Mauritanian embassy guards posted at the embassy quickly returned fire. Although the overall attack had an "inconsequential" impact, the ensuing gunfight injured three bystanders including a French woman at the nearby nightclub. The attackers then escaped in a vehicle.
In a statement titled "At your orders, Gaza," the extremist group Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility for the attack and personally threatened the Israeli ambassador. According to the United States-based IntelCenter, one of Al-Qaeda's top commanders Ayman al-Zawahri had called for attacks on the Israeli ambassador in 2007. The attack was the latest in a string of violence to impact the country, coming just after the murder of four French tourists, and an attack that killed in three Mauritanian troops in December 2007.
Aftermath.
The next day, Mauritanian authorities announced they had detained three suspects approximately 150 kilometers (93 m) from the capital. On 8 February, it was announced that eight people, including an Algerian national, had been arrested in connection to the attack. In response to the attack, Israeli embassies worldwide were placed on a heightened security alert and an Israeli defense official was dispatched to Mauritania to evaluate the embassy's security. The Israeli Ambassador to Mauritania Boaz Bismuth stated on radio: "The opposition savagely attacked Israel because of the situation in Gaza. The media criticized Israel blatantly and exaggeratedly."

The Winchcombe Chronicle is a chronicle of the town of Winchcombe from about 1140-1145.
The original text was drafted in the 1140s, and later extended to 1181. The chronicle is also sometimes known as the "Annals of Winchcombe", though it differs from the earlier Winchcombe Annals, produced by the same Abbey.
The Latin chronicle is anonymous, but was written in the Benedictine, Winchcombe Abbey (Gloucestershire).
The manuscript is in two parts. The first, the work of a single scribe, is a world history from creation to 1122 which takes much of its material from John of Worcester's "Chronica chronicarum".
The addendum contains more recent material. The manuscript also has numerous margin notes of more recent events.
The manuscript is currently held at the Bodleian Library, and is found at BL, Cotton Tiberius E iv, folios 1r-27v.

Dayah Hotel attack

The Dayah Hotel attack occurred on 25 January 2017 when a hotel in the Somali capital city Mogadishu was attacked by Al-Shabaab gunmen and car bombs, killing 28 people and injuring 43 others. Taking place shortly after 08:00 on a Wednesday morning, the attack began when a car filled with explosives rammed the gate of the Dayah Hotel, a luxury hotel popular with politicians, and detonated. Immediately after, four armed militants attempted to storm the hotel – however Somali security guards shot the men dead before they reached it. As emergency services and journalists converged on the scene, a second car bomb detonated, causing more casualties.
Radio Andalus, a station with links to Al-Shabaab, reported that "well-armed mujahideen attacked the hotel, and now they are fighting inside the hotel." The attack came shortly before the date of the country's presidential election was due to be announced.

The University Neighborhood Historic District comprises the residential area south of the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming. The 24-block historic district is bounded on the north by University Avenue, the east by 15th Street, the south by Custer Street, and the west by 6th Street. The neighborhood's period of significance is from 1872 to 1958, a time when the area around the university was developed. Architectural styles in the district are diverse and the neighborhood is almost entirely composed of single-family residences.
At least 25 houses were designed by Laramie architect Wilbur A. Hitchcock in diverse styles. Hitchcock was a major contributor to the campus itself. Many of the houses have matching detached garages. Special emphasis was placed on landscaping and the planting of trees, giving the neighborhood the local title of the "Tree Area." During the early 20th century the neighborhood provided accommodation in apartments for university students until dormitories were built. By the mid-20th century house styles moved away from Craftsman, Tudor revival and Queen Anne style houses and examples of streamline moderne, mission revival and international style houses appeared. In 1950 the United Presbyterian Church built a Usonian style church, influenced by the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright.
The neighborhood was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in, 2009.

Founder takes all

The Founder Takes All (FTA) hypothesis refers to the evolutionary advantages conferred to first-arriving lineages in an ecosystem.
Overview.
Density-dependent processes such as gene surfing, low-density blocking, and competitive exclusion can play a crucial role in the spatial structuring of biodiversity. These interrelated demographic processes can generate striking geographic contrasts in the distributions of genes and species. Density-dependent processes refer to biogeographical processes in which population density (relative to resources) constrains the ability of new arriving lineages to establish 
It is proposed that well-studied evolutionary and ecological biogeographic patterns of postglacial recolonization, progressive island colonization, microbial sectoring, and even the "Out of Africa" pattern of human expansion are fundamentally similar. All these patterns are underpinned by the "founder takes all" density-independent principle.
It is hypothesized that older historical constraints of density-independent processes are seen today, within the dramatic biogeographic shifts that occur in response to human-mediated extinction events. Due to these extinction events, surviving lineages can rapidly expand their ranges to replace extinct sister taxa.
The FTA model.
The FTA model is underpinned by demographic and ecological phenomena and processes such as the Allee effect, gene surfing, high-density blocking, and priority effects. Early colonizing lineages can reach high densities and thus hinder the success of late-arriving colonizers. It has been suggested that this can strongly influence spatial biodiversity patterns.
Scientific evidence for FTA processes has emerged from a variety of evolutionary, biogeographic, and ecological research areas. Examples include: the sectoring patterns sometimes evident in microbial colonies; phylogeographic sectoring of lineages, inferred to have rapidly expanded into new terrain-following deglaciation; the island progression rule; and sudden biological replacement (lineage turnover) following extirpation.
One possible scientific consequence of FTA dynamics is that gene flow measures based on the genetics of contemporary high-density populations may underestimate actual rates of dispersal and invasion potential.

Arthur R. M. Spaid

Arthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid (July 27, 1866 – March 16, 1936) was an American educator, school administrator, lecturer, and writer. He served as principal of Alexis I. duPont High School (1894–1903) in Wilmington, Delaware, superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools (1903–1913) in Delaware, superintendent of Dorchester County Public Schools (1913–1917) in Maryland, and Delaware State commissioner of Education (1917–1921).
Born in West Virginia, Spaid began his career in education as a schoolteacher in Virginia and as a school administrator in Ohio. After a decade as a principal Spaid became a superintendent; in this role he argued for compulsory education and the consolidation of New Castle County's rural public schools, instituted pay raises for teachers to mitigate a teacher shortage, and served on a committee to revise the state public school system's curriculum.
Spaid received a Master of Arts degree in education from Columbia University in 1917, the same year he became the Delaware State Commissioner of Education. As commissioner, Spaid worked to bring efficiency to the state's public school system; his efforts resulted in the Delaware State Board of Education's adoption of a new school code in 1919. He left Delaware in 1921 and engaged in Chautauqua-related work before becoming the head of the Education Department at Salem University in Salem, West Virginia, from 1926 to 1936.
Spaid was a naturalist by hobby and took hundreds of photographs, using them to illustrate his nature study articles and lecture slides. Throughout his career as a school administrator, he served as an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple courses, institutes, and organizations. Spaid was also an avid writer, and he published articles in "Scientific American" and "Country Life in America". He had planned to author a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens; however, his home and notebooks were destroyed in a fire in 1917. Spaid died at the home of his daughter in Winchester, Virginia, in 1936. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher, Spaid "placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware, and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas."
Early life and education.
Arthur Rusmiselle Miller Spaid was born on July 27, 1866 in Capon Springs, West Virginia, to John W. Spaid and his wife, Margaret Elizabeth Brill Spaid. Arthur Spaid was the eldest of six children, with two brothers and three sisters: Luther Lore "Boyd" Spaid (1868–1877), Elia May Spaid (1870–1911), Martha Evalona Spaid (1875–1921), William Pohe Spaid (1878–1885), and Eleanor "Nellie" Love Spaid (1881–1963). His great-great-grandfather, George Nicholas Spaid (né Spaht), originated from Kassel, Germany, and settled in Hampshire County along the Cacapon River in the late 18th century. Arthur Spaid and his siblings were raised by their parents on a small farm on Timber Ridge. His father was a shoemaker who was interested in literature and recorded local history in notebooks. 
Spaid received his primary and secondary education in the public schools of Hampshire County and worked on his family's farm until the age of 20. He completed his primary education in 1886 and earned his teaching certificate shortly thereafter. In the spring of 1886, he attended Professor Taylor's private school in Lacey Spring, Virginia, for three months and won prizes in spelling and history while there. Throughout his early education, Spaid was active in "scholastic athletics," including corner ball, baseball, running, and jumping. In the summer of 1886, Spaid briefly attended Professor Borglebaugh's normal school in nearby Broadway, Virginia. He completed his teacher's examination shortly thereafter and earned his teaching certificate.
Career.
Teaching and librarian.
In 1886, Spaid began his first teaching position at the rural Loan Oak School in Broadway; he remained there until 1887. During his time in Broadway, he was a member of the Broadway Literary Society. Spaid visited Washington, Ohio, at his cousin's invitation. He entered Washington College and subsequently resigned from his teaching position in Virginia. To support himself during his first year in Washington, Spaid served as the college's assistant librarian and as the librarian of the town's Woman's Christian Temperance Union library. During this time he lived on two to three dollars per month, and was a bachelor. The following year, Spaid took on the role of the sexton of the Christian Church.
School administration.
From 1889 to 1890, Spaid served as the principal of Twin Township High School in Bourneville, Ohio. From 1890 to 1891, he was principal of Bourneville's graded schools. While in Bourneville he economized by residing with village school teacher E. M. Parrett. Spaid reentered college in 1891, but following the illness and death of his brother-in-law Carter Gilbert Kelso, Spaid returned to Bourneville to teach his brother-in-law's class for the remainder of the term. After completing Kelso's term, Spaid returned to his studies, finished his course in 1893, and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from Wilmington College in Wilmington, Ohio, where he was president of his class and participated in the Dorian Literary Society.
During his senior year at Wilmington College, Spaid was awarded the $500 Haverford Fellowship, which allowed him to pursue a year of post-graduate work at Haverford College in Haverford, Pennsylvania. He returned to Concord in Hampshire County, West Virginia, and then entered Haverford College in 1893. Spaid completed his graduate studies in American history and earned a Master of Arts degree from Haverford College in 1894.
Spaid relocated to Delaware in 1894 and was elected principal of Alexis I. duPont High School in Wilmington. According to historians Hu Maxwell and Howard Llewellyn Swisher, Spaid "placed himself in the front rank of the educational works of Delaware and received the commendation of the press and the educators for his advanced ideas." While serving as the high school's principal, he and his family resided in the Highlands neighborhood of Wilmington. In June 1897, at the end of the school year, the school's students presented Spaid with a traveling case. He served as the principal of Alexis I. duPont High School until 1903.
Superintendent of county public schools.
Spaid was the Superintendent of New Castle County Public Schools from 1903 to 1913. During that time he resided in Brandywine. He was one of three county superintendents in Delaware; the other two administered the public schools in Kent and Sussex counties. Throughout his tenure, Spaid argued for compulsory education and the modernization and consolidation of the county's public schools. In November 1904, a special session of the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the other two county superintendents to a committee charged with proposing and explaining legislation to improve and modernize the state's public school system to the Delaware Senate and Delaware House of Representatives. At a legislative conference on education in January 1905, Spaid and the other two county superintendents urged the consolidation of Delaware's rural schools to improve the education of students in the state's more isolated areas. Spaid declared at the conference that he would require greater influence if he were to be reappointed as superintendent. According to a local newspaper, he stated that "if the position of superintendent of free schools was not worth awarding on merit alone ... then he wanted to get out." He emphasized the necessity for graded consolidated schools in rural areas of New Castle County. Spaid noted that some of the county's rural schools had only one student in attendance for weeks at a time during the school year, and because of this the county's public schools were wasting money and the children in those affected areas were growing up in "ignorance". Spaid concluded that "compulsory education and consolidation of the schools was needed."
To keep the county's teacher positions fully staffed, Spaid instituted pay raises for some teachers in July 1906 so they would return for the fall term. In May 1908, the Delaware State Board of Education appointed Spaid and the county superintendents to a committee charged with revising the state public school system's curriculum.
While serving as New Castle County superintendent, Spaid's support of prohibition brought him into a public conflict with Wilmington's German American community. In 1907, Spaid received a letter from William J. Hogan who inquired about his position on prohibition. Spaid's response, the community held, made "insulting remarks" about the unreliability of immigrants who drank beer. The local German-American Alliance held a public meeting at a Turn Hall regarding Spaid's letter and addressed an open letter to him in which the alliance noted the academic achievements of Germans and the low literacy rates in prohibition states.
In 1913, Spaid was named superintendent of Dorchester County Public Schools in nearby Dorchester County, Maryland. While serving in this position, he received a Master of Arts degree in education from Columbia University in 1917. At Columbia, Spaid completed a course in school administration and supervision, and was a member of the university's Administration Club. In addition to his Master of Arts degree, Columbia also conferred upon Spaid the title of "Superintendent of Schools".
State Commissioner of Delaware Education.
From July 1, 1917 until July 1, 1921, Spaid served as the Delaware State Commissioner of Education, during which time he resided with his family at 241 North State Street in Dover. Philanthropist Pierre S. du Pont was secretary of the Delaware State Board of Education while Spaid served in this position.
In May 1918, Spaid held meetings of the Delaware State Board of Education at Stanton and locations across Delaware to hear from residents in school districts affected by the Delaware General Assembly's 1915 alteration of school district boundaries, to include consolidation of districts. As state commissioner, he convened a State Teachers' Institute in Newark in August 1918.
During his tenure as state commissioner, Delaware's public school system was impacted by World War I and the 1918 influenza pandemic. The pandemic caused Delaware's State Board of Health to shutter the state's public schools for three to four weeks. In November 1918, Spaid issued a four-page bulletin entitled, "Our Children Must Be Educated", in which he appealed to parents and school administrators to address rising teacher resignations, school children withdrawals and other conditions affecting the state's public school system. In his bulletin, Spaid commended the work of Liberty bond campaigns and War Work drives. In addition, he stated, "This great world war is being fought to make democracy safe, but a democracy to be safe must be composed of intelligent citizens." He stressed that it was necessary to keep Delaware's children in school to avoid illiteracy. He concluded his bulletin by stating, "Let us make still one more 'drive,' and 'go over the top' for an efficient school system, thus laying the everlasting foundation of a government in which democracy will be safe."
Under Spaid's initiative to bring efficiency to the state's public school system, the Delaware State Board of Education adopted a new school code in 1919. According to Spaid its purpose was to provide an equal education for all Delaware students. He also noted that the code addressed the problem of illiteracy, which had been discovered by draft boards during World War I, and that the code sought to integrate all of Delaware's public schools into a coordinated state system. In May 1921, Spaid and the State Board of Education urged county superintendents and school principals to observe Memorial Day at their schools, in coordination with local Grand Army of the Republic, United Spanish War Veterans, and World War Veterans organizations. Spaid and the state board also recommended that school children bring flowers from home, place them at veterans' graves in local cemeteries, and be dismissed for the remainder of the school day. Spaid resigned as Delaware's State Commissioner of Education in 1921.
Later years.
In 1921, after resigning as Delaware's State Commissioner of Education, Spaid left Delaware and began engaging in Chautauqua-related work. Around 1926, he became head of the Education Department at Salem University in Salem, West Virginia, and served in this position until 1936.
Lecturer and writer.
Spaid was a naturalist by hobby, and he took hundreds of photographs of objects in nature, which he used as illustrations in his nature study articles and lecture slides. Outside of his positions as a school administrator, Spaid was an instructor, lecturer, and speaker for multiple public courses, institutes, and organizations. In 1900 and 1902, he delivered illustrated lectures for the Natural History Society of Delaware at the Wilmington Friends School on the topics of "The Historic and Picturesque Shenandoah Valley", "Eggs and Feathers", and "Leaves and Blossoms." In 1901, Spaid delivered a lecture on reptiles entitled "Fangs, Fins and Stings" in the Breck's Mill Area of Wilmington, and in February and April 1904, he presented a lecture tour across northern Delaware with illustrated lectures on "Eggs and Feathers", "The Picturesque Luray Caverns", and "Historic Shenandoah Valley." Between 1903 and 1905, Spaid gave 100 public lectures to around 10,000 people, including a new lecture entitled, "Delaware, Nesting Place of the Blue Hen's Chickens". In April 1911, at a meeting of rural New Castle County teachers in Wilmington Spaid delivered a speech on birds. In November 1917, he addressed the annual convention of the Delaware Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Seaford on the importance of scientific temperance instruction in public schools. In June 1919, Spaid held an open-air meeting on faith and asserted that "one outstanding result" of World War I "was a return to elemental Christian faith."
In addition to his public lectures, Spaid delivered 100 lectures in the county's schools while serving as the New Castle County superintendent. He was also an instructor and lecturer for the Delaware State Summer School for 11 years, and for the Maryland State Summer School for two years. He served as a Sunday speaker for the temperance movement Anti-Saloon League in Delaware, Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania for several years. In addition, Spaid was a lecturer in the People's Course at Newark, New Jersey, for five years, and was a lecturer at teachers' institutes in Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.
Publications.
In addition to public speaking, Spaid was an avid writer. His articles on the subjects of history and nature included:
Spaid had planned to write a book on his nature studies, for which he had written notes and collected specimens. However, in May 1917, he lost his home to a fire, which destroyed the notebooks containing his life's work in nature study.
Death.
In mid-February 1936, Spaid became ill while visiting his niece, Mrs. Lee Calvert, in Washington, D.C. Two weeks later, he was taken to the home of his daughter, Margaret Spaid LaFollette, in Winchester, Virginia. He suffered a heart attack on March 15, 1936 and died of heart failure the following day. Spaid was survived by his wife and five children. His funeral service was held at the Christian Church in Winchester on March 19, 1936. Spaid was interred at Mount Hebron Cemetery in Winchester. Spaid's obituary in the "Wilmington Morning News" wrote that he had "devoted his life to educational work".
Personal life.
Marriage and children.
Spaid married Mary Abi Farquhar on September 30, 1897. Farquhar was born on April 11, 1872 and was the daughter of Benjamin and Mary B. Farquhar of Wilmington, Ohio. She graduated from Wilmington College in June 1894, a year after Spaid. Farquhar underwent training in a year-long kindergarten teaching class in Columbus and worked as a kindergarten teacher at the Alexis I. duPont School. Spaid and his wife had six children, consisting of two daughters and four sons:
Civic and religious affiliations.
In April 1900, Spaid was a founding member and first president of the Delaware Audubon Society, with "its object being the protection of birds and the discouraging of their use in wearing apparel and for the purposes of ornament." He served as a state director of Delaware's National Education Association and was a member of the National Society for the Promotion of Vocational Education. Spaid was also a member of the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the National Grange of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry, and the Methodist Episcopal Church. He held offices in both the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the National Grange. While he resided in Wilmington, Delaware, Spaid was a member of the Washington Heights Methodist Episcopal Church, and one of the founders of the McCabe Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church. He became a member of the American Museum of Natural History in 1935.

American Legion Hall, Post 32

The American Legion Hall, Post 32 is a prominent social center in Greybull, Wyoming. Built in 1922 as a temporary church, it became an American Legion hall in 1935. Used as overflow space by nearby schools, it serves a diverse range of functions in the community. 
History.
The hall was built in 1922 by the Trinity Methodist Episcopal Church as a temporary sanctuary while their new church was built. It later functioned as a social hall for the church. Since it was located in close proximity to town schools, it was used as overflow space. The town used the hall as a polling place until at least 1955. The American Legion bought the building in 1935, after the church congregation abandoned their church project. Although a much larger community center was built by the town with a WPA grant in 1936, the Legion Hall remained popular for smaller gatherings and for events that featured a speaker. Organizations as diverse as the railroad union and the Odd Fellows met there. In later years it was used for day care, until 1995, and used for storage after that. In 2015 work started on plans for rehabilitation of the structure.
Description.
The Legion Hall is a simple framed building, about by , with a gabled roof. The gables are clad in wood shingles, while the body of the building is sheathed in closely lapping clapboards. A tightly arranged grouping of windows flanks the main entrance at the gable end, facing the street on the east side. Five evenly spaced windows line the south elevation, and the west elevation is blank except for a small window in the gable. An annex measuring by covers much of the north elevation, housing accessory spaces. The main hall is about twelve feet in height and was originally covered in lath and plaster. Poor structural performance of the original scissor trusses led to the installation of columns in the main hall to support the roof.
Post 32 of the American Legion was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on June 24, 2014.

Penny Penny

Eric Kulani Giyani Nkovani (born 1962), better known by his stage names Penny Penny and Papa Penny is a South African musician and politician, known affectionately as the "Shangaan Disco King" for the musical style he helped popularise.
He was the youngest of 68 children from a local traditional Surgeon/ doctor with 25 wives. His family was poor, meaning he received no education, but he soon became known for his dancing and was nicknamed Penny. Aged 19, he worked on a West Driefontein goldmine near Carletonville, and soon left to escape the region's poor working conditions, although he won several breakdancing trophies before his departure. His breakthrough came with the recording and release of his 1994 debut album "Shaka Bundu", which was recorded in a week using little gear but went on to sell 250,000 copies in the country. The music features Tsonga (or Shangaan) disco sound, which emerged in Penny's native Tsonga culture, fused with contemporary house music from the United States. Unusually, the songs on the album were recorded in the Tsonga or Xitsonga language, or more specifically its Limpopo-region dialect Xihlanganu, one of the least-heard languages in South Africa. This was a conscious choice on behalf of Penny, who wanted to introduce his language "to the world." He stayed in Peta Teanet 's mansion in Tzaneen for 3 months while he was being taught music by the King of Disco Peta Teanet. 
He recorded several further albums, including "Laphinda Shangaan" (1997) and "Makanjta Jive" (1998), both of which outsold "Shaka Bundu", although none of his albums were distributed outside of South Africa, and he soon drifted into obscurity as the country's music trends moved on. "Shaka Bundu" was re-released worldwide by Awesome Tapes From Africa, which helped renew his musical popularity. His newfound popularity spread to the clubs of Los Angeles.
In 2017, he began creating music in a style he called "heavy gum," after growing tired of being referred to as the "Shangaan Disco King". He said: "I never labelled myself as Shangaan Disco King, other people did. I am tired of people knowing me only because of my language. Music is more than the language you speak." His first single in the style was "Goldie Bone." 
As a politician, Penny works in the African National Congress as a council member. He entered a publicised long-running spat with a chief based in Giyani over an initiative for free water, explaining that he "entered into a partnership with a local farmer to help provide water to the community but was apparently stopped from implementing the plan by the chief."
Since 2017, he also stars in his own reality series "Penny Ahee" on Mzansi Magic, which was commissioned after a successful appearance as a judge on "Clash of the Choirs".
Penny Penny is married and has 25 children, with 23 of them from previous relationships.

Twentymile River

The Twentymile River is a river near the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska. It rises in a remote valley from meltwater of several small glaciers in the Chugach Mountains and flows out into a large, wide valley where it receives the water of the Moraine and Glacier rivers. Eventually, the river empties into Turnagain Arm after flowing to a broad marshy delta alongside the deltas of Portage Creek and the Placer River. Contrary to popular belief, the source of the river is not Twentymile Glacier.

Walter Julius Bloem

Walter Julius Bloem (October 22, 1898 – presumed dead 1945) was a German writer who became known under the pseudonym Kilian Koll. Bloem was an officer in the First and Second World War as well as a member of the SS.
Life.
Bloem was born in 1898 in Barmen, in present-day North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany as the son of the writer Walter Bloem, noted as an author of patriotic novels, and his first wife Margarete Kalähne. His father e.g. wrote the memoir "The Advance from Mons 1914"—the translation included a foreword by James Edward Edmonds who called it "one of the most graphic and dramatic accounts of the war yet written."
Since his earliest youth, Bloem suffered from irreparable hearing damage. Nevertheless, in 1915, at the age of 16, he volunteered for service in the First World War at the front, after he had fulfilled his father's demand that he complete his Oberprima (roughly advanced secondary school in the US) at Easter 1915. In the war, he was decorated several times including the Iron Cross, first and second classes, and at the end of the war, he was lieutenant and company commander on the Western Front. He was wounded several times, and his hearing damage had worsened so much that he was almost deaf. After the war, he fought until 1919 in the Freikorps in Poznań against Polish paramilitaries.
Back in civilian life, he studied philosophy and was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy. After several trips through Germany and Western Europe, he finally settled with his wife as a settler in Nikolaiken, East Prussia.
Bloem began writing novels and poetry. His concentration was, among other things, the new medium of film. Under the title "Die Seele des Lichtspiels - Ein Bekenntnis zum Film" (The Soul of the Moving Picture - an Avowal of Film), he produced a work in 1922 which is still recognized today by film theorists. In order to distance himself from his famous father, he wrote under the pseudonym Kilian Koll.
In addition, he discovered the love of soaring.
In 1933, Bloem welcomed the seizure of power ("Machtergreifung") by Adolf Hitler and saw him as the savior of Germany. In his works Bloem glorified National Socialist ideas.
Despite his severe disability, he succeeded in joining the Luftwaffe as an officer in 1938. During the Second World War, he flew missions with the "Boelcke" squadron (Kampfgeschwader 27) in the war against Poland and France. He was shot down in May 1940, but was able to parachute to safety. After a short French captivity, he returned to Germany.
He joined the Waffen-SS, where he last fought in May 1945 in the battles in and around Berlin. He is considered missing since then.
After the war, many of his works in the Soviet occupation zone were added to the "Liste der auszusondernden Literatur" (list of banned books).
Works.
The short story "Urlaub auf Ehrenwort" was filmed twice: once in 1937 under the direction of Karl Ritter, featuring René Deltgen, Berta Drews, Carl Raddatz, and Paul Dahlke. A remake was made in 1955, directed by Wolfgang Liebeneiner, featuring, among others, Claus Biederstaedt and Paul Esser.

Laura Cadieux II

Laura Cadieux II () is a Canadian comedy film, directed by Denise Filiatrault and released in 1999. A sequel to the 1998 film "It's Your Turn, Laura Cadieux (C'est à ton tour, Laura Cadieux)", the film placed the characters from the first film, which was a direct adaptation of the novel by Michel Tremblay, in an original story written entirely by Filiatrault.
In the film, Laura Cadieux (Ginette Reno) and her friends are taking a cruise on the St. Lawrence River to celebrate Laura's 50th birthday. Laura is trying to fend off the advances of the ship's captain (Michel Dumont); Alice Thibodeau (Sonia Vachon) is freely flirting with nearly all of the men on board while Albert (Martin Drainville) is struggling to make his own feelings for her known; Lucille Bolduc (Adèle Reinhardt) is unsuccessfully trying to catch the eye of Oscar Blanchette (Donald Pilon); Mme. Brouillette (Denise Dubois) is newly liberated from an abusive husband; and Laura's mother-in law (Dominique Michel) is constantly tormenting Laura with her demands. Meanwhile, Laura's best friend, Mme Therrien (Pierrette Robitaille), who spent the first film running around downtown Montreal after mistakenly believing Laura's young son had gotten lost, here mistakenly boards the wrong boat and spends the duration of the film on a cargo ship introducing a bunch of Russian sailors to Québécois culture.
The film received five Genie Award nominations at the 21st Genie Awards: Best Actress (2: Reno, Robitaille), Best Costume Design (Suzanne Harel), Best Original Song (François Dompierre, "Fortuna") and Best Original Score (Dompierre).

2018 British Columbia electoral reform referendum

A referendum on electoral reform took place by mail-in ballot between October 22 and December 7, 2018, in the Canadian province of British Columbia. 61.3 percent of voters supported maintaining the first-past-the-post voting system rather than switching to a proportional representation voting system, which was supported by 38.7 percent of voters. This was British Columbia's third referendum on electoral reform, following ones in 2005 and 2009.
Voters were asked two questions: first, what electoral system should be used to determine election results—the existing first-past-the-post (FPTP) system or a proportional representation (PR) system; and second, what type of proportional voting system should be used if PR were chosen. In the second question, voters were asked to rank three proportional representation voting systems: dual-member proportional representation, mixed-member proportional representation, and rural–urban proportional representation.
The referendum fulfilled an election commitment by the British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP) during the 2017 election. Their platform promised a referendum and that the government would actively campaign for electoral reform. Results were released by Elections BC on December 20, 2018.
Background.
BC has a long history of changing its electoral system. For BC's first election in 1871, the majority of ridings were elected using an "at large" system. This is the way city councillors are elected in BC to this day: a voter gets as many votes as there were people to be elected in the riding.
Over its history, BC modified its electoral system at least 15 times without a referendum. It previously used an alternative voting system in the 1952 provincial election before abolishing it and reestablishing the previous mix of "at large" and first-past-the-post. The first BC election done entirely under first-past-the-post came in 1991, after the last "at-large" voting districts had been abolished. The multi-member at-large ridings were abolished after the 1986 election due to a Supreme Court of Canada ruling that found them unconstitutional.
Previous referendums.
Before the 2001 provincial election, the BC Liberal Party committed to appoint a Citizens' Assembly to investigate electoral reform, hold consultations, and prepare a report recommending whether a different electoral system should be adopted. The commitment was driven in part by the anomalous provincial election result in 1996, in which the BC New Democratic Party won reelection as a majority government with 39.5% of the vote and 39 seats, despite gaining a 3% smaller share of the popular vote than the Liberals at 41.8%, which translated into 33 Liberal seats. In December 2004, the Assembly released its report recommending that the province adopt BC-STV, a BC-specific variant of the single transferable vote (STV) system. On May 17, 2005, a referendum was held in conjunction with the 2005 general election, in which voters were asked whether the province should adopt the recommendation of the Assembly to replace the first-past-the-post electoral system with BC-STV, or maintain the current system. While 57.7% of the electorate voted in favour of BC-STV, including a majority of voters in 77 of 79 ridings, its support failed to reach the 60% threshold set by the government and it was not adopted.
Following the 2005 referendum, British Columbia held a second referendum on electoral reform in conjunction with the provincial election on May 12, 2009. It was the most recent referendum on electoral reform that has been held in British Columbia. As in 2005, voters in 2009 were asked to provide their opinions on the BC-STV electoral system proposed by the British Columbia Citizen's Assembly on Electoral Reform to ensure more proportional representation in the provincial Legislative Assembly. British Columbians were asked which electoral system should be used to elect legislators: the existing first-past-the-post electoral system or the proposed BC-STV system.
The adoption of BC-STV in the 2009 referendum was defeated, with 60.9% voting against the reform and 39.09% of voters supporting the change.
Intervening federal developments.
During the 2015 federal election, Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party of Canada campaigned on the promise that it would be the last federal election under the first-past-the-post electoral system. The party's platform stated that a Liberal government would form an all-party Parliamentary committee, and introduce legislation within 18 months enacting electoral reform. On December 1, 2016, the House of Commons of Canada Special Committee on Electoral Reform released its report recommending Canada hold a referendum to adopt a proportional representation voting system for federal elections. Several months later, the government announced that it was no longer pursuing electoral reform.
Origin of third referendum.
During the 2017 provincial election, both the NDP and the Green Party campaigned for PR and included the policy in their election platforms. On May 29, 2017, approximately three weeks after the election resulted in a BC Liberal minority government, the NDP and Green caucuses signed a supply and confidence agreement. The agreement included a section on PR, in which the parties agreed to put the issue to a referendum and that both parties would actively campaign for PR in the referendum. On June 22, 2017, the Liberal government tabled its throne speech, adopting the opposition parties' policy to hold a third referendum on electoral reform. On June 29, 2017, the BC Liberal government was defeated in a confidence vote. Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon then invited the NDP to form a minority government with Green support. On November 30, 2017, the "Electoral Reform Referendum 2018 Act" was passed into law. It required the referendum to be held and authorized Cabinet to make various regulations.
Consultation and implementation.
Between November 2017 and February 2018, Attorney General David Eby conducted a public consultation entitled "How We Vote". On May 30, 2018, he released the report on the consultation and recommendations concerning how the referendum process should be conducted. Cabinet accepted the recommendations shortly thereafter, in early June. Later in June, Vote PR BC launched their campaign for proportional representation, canvassing in cities across the province.
Elections BC reviewed the referendum questions in June. On June 18, Chief Electoral Officer Anton Boegman wrote to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly advising that in his view both questions were simple and clear enough for voters to understand. He also made recommendations for small changes to the questions. On June 22, 2018, the government released the regulations governing the referendum. The regulations adopted the changes to the question proposed by the Chief Electoral Officer, and set down other rules governing the campaign.
ICBA lawsuit.
On June 28, 2018, the Independent Contractors and Business Association (ICBA)—a lobby group for the construction industry— filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to stop the referendum, or alternatively, to strike down the campaign financing rules governing the referendum. The lawsuit contains various complaints about the process, the referendum, and the systems on the ballot. In response, NDP MLA Bob D'Eith called the lawsuit an attempt to stop people from having a choice in their electoral system, and said ICBA does not want "ordinary people to have a stronger voice in the elections and I think they're desperate to hang on to the status quo". The Ministry of the Attorney General is defending the legislation in court. The official campaign began July 1, 2018.
On July 17, 2018, ICBA's court application for an early trial date was dismissed by Justice Miriam Gropper of the British Columbia Supreme Court, in order to allow the government time to respond. Following the hearing, ICBA's lawyer, Peter Gall, told reporters ICBA would be seeking an interim injunction.
On July 24, ICBA filed an application seeking an interim injunction to halt campaign financing rules and prevent ballots from being counted. The application was heard by Justice Gropper on August 7. In her decision handed down several weeks later, she dismissed the application calling ICBA's allegations about the referendum "rhetoric", "conjecture" and "exaggeration". In mid-September, the ICBA announced that they will be seeking leave to appeal Justice Gropper's ruling on the interim injunction. That same month, the British Columbia Government and Service Employees' Union was granted intervenor status by the court, siding against the ICBA.
The appeal of Justice Gropper's judgement concerning the interim injunction was heard on November 2. Justice Fitch of the British Columbia Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal, finding that there was no merit to the ICBA's argument.
Ballot structure and details.
Voters were asked two questions in the referendum. The first revolved around what electoral system should be used to determine election results: the existing first-past-the-post system or a proportional representation system. The second question explored what type of proportional voting system should be used if PR is chosen. This involved voters ranking three proportional representation voting systems: dual-member proportional representation, mixed-member proportional representation, and rural–urban proportional representation.
Proportional voting systems on the ballot.
The referendum asked voters to rank three proportional representation voting systems in order of preference: Voters ranked one, two, or all three systems.
Dual-member proportional (DMP).
Dual-member proportional is an electoral system designed to produce proportional election results across a region by electing two representatives in each of the region's districts. The first seat in every district is awarded to the candidate who receives the most votes, similar to first-past-the-post voting. The second seat is awarded to one of the remaining district candidates so that proportionality is achieved across the region, using a calculation that aims to award parties their seats in the districts where they had their strongest performances.
DMP was invented in 2013 by a University of Alberta mathematics student named Sean Graham. The system was intended as a possible replacement for first-past-the-post voting in Canadian national and provincial elections. Whereas campaigns to adopt MMP representation or the single transferable vote had recently been defeated in a number of Canadian provinces (such as the 2005 and 2009 British Columbia referendums, the 2005 Prince Edward Island referendum, and the 2007 Ontario referendum), the intent behind DMP was to gain broader acceptance by retaining salient features of first-past-the-post voting. These features include a one-vote ballot, relatively small districts (compared with STV), and a single tier of local representatives (in contrast to MMP).
Mixed-member proportional.
Mixed-member proportional is a mixed electoral system in which voters get two votes: one to decide the representative for their single-seat constituency, and one for a political party. Seats in the legislature are filled firstly by candidates in local ridings, and secondly, by party candidates based on the percentage of nationwide or region-wide votes that each party received.
In 2004, MMP was recommended by the Law Commission of Canada to be adopted for federal elections. In 2007, Ontario held a provincial referendum to adopt the system, which failed to pass. In 2016, Prince Edward Island (PEI) voted to adopt MMP in a non-binding referendum. PEI held another referendum on the issue during the 2019 provincial election and narrowly voted against MMP.
A form of MMP is used for national elections in New Zealand and Germany, and in the United Kingdom for elections to the devolved parliaments of Scotland and Wales (where the system is referred to as the Additional Member System).
Rural–urban proportional (RUP).
Rural–urban proportional is a hybrid-proportional system designed by Fair Vote Canada to meet the challenges of Canada's geography. As put forward for the BC referendum, it would use mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) in rural areas and the single transferable vote (STV) in urban and semi-urban areas. Sweden, Denmark and Iceland use voting models with similar hybrid approaches. In Canada from the 1920s to the 1950s, the provinces of Alberta and Manitoba used a hybrid rural–urban system where STV was used in large cities and the alternative vote was used in single-member rural districts.
The hybrid approach taken by rural–urban proportional reflects lessons learned from previous attempts to pass electoral reform. A major advantage of rural–urban proportional as designed is that it requires creating far fewer top-up seats to achieve proportionality than MMP. Under rural–urban PR, no more than 10–15% of seats – versus 40% of seats under MMP – would need to be set aside as top-up seats to achieve proportionality, because the results from the urban and semi-urban areas would already be proportional owing to their voting having been conducted using STV.
For rural areas, rural–urban proportional is advantageous because existing first-past-the-post rural ridings need to grow only 15% larger to facilitate extra regional top-up seats under it, compared to 67% larger if MMP was chosen or double in size if DMP was chosen.
RUP is the only PR system of the three that lets voters rank individual candidates in order by preference. The use of STV ranked ballots means that all candidates must compete with one another for a voter's coveted first place ranking, including candidates running for the same party. Voters can rank long-shot independent candidates or candidates from unpopular parties first without fear of wasting their vote, because votes for badly performing candidates will be transferred during counting—based on each voter's preferences—to candidates who have yet to be eliminated, until all seats are won.
In its scorecard of proportional voting systems, Fair Voting BC gave rural–urban proportional its highest ranking. During the Canadian government's 2016 consultation on electoral reform at the federal level, both the New Democratic Party of Canada and Green Party of Canada recommended Canada adopt either RUP or MMP.
Campaign.
The official campaign began July 1, 2018. Groups had until July 6 to apply to Elections BC to be named the official proponent or opponent groups and receive $500,000 in public funding. On July 12, Elections BC announced that Vote PR BC would be the official proponent group and No BC Proportional Representation Society would be the official opponent group. Other individuals, groups and political parties are permitted to register as referendum advertisers with Elections BC, but are not eligible for public funds.
The NDP and Green Party campaigned for proportional representation. Sonia Furstenau, a Green MLA, held town halls about electoral reform in cities across the province in July and August. BC Premier John Horgan launched the NDP's referendum campaign in early September, saying "Proportional representation means exactly what it says. Whatever proportion, or share, of the vote a party wins, they get that many seats in government." Andrew Wilkinson, BC Liberal leader, opposed the referendum and a change to a proportional representation system.
Elections BC mailed a referendum information card to every household in the province between September 10 and 28, and a voter's guide between October 15 and 26. Voters received their referendum voting package in the mail between October 22 and November 2. In early September, the members of the Canadian Union of Postal Workers voted in favour of job action. The strike resulted in Elections BC extending the voting deadline by a week.
In early November, Horgan announced that he had cast his ballot for proportional representation, and that his first choice was MMP. Vote PR BC, the official proponent group, flew Andrew Coyne to Vancouver to give a talk endorsing PR, where Coyne announced he supported Rural–Urban Proportional.
Debate.
In late September, Andrew Wilkinson challenged John Horgan to a debate concerning the referendum, a challenge which Horgan accepted. The debate took place on November 8 at 7:00pm. It was broadcast on CBC News and Global News.
Official campaign organizations.
Official campaign organizations include the official proponent and opponent groups along with referendum advertising sponsors.
Voting period extension.
On November 23, 2018, due to a postal strike, Elections BC extended the voting period deadline by a week – from November 30, 2018, to December 7, 2018. The deadline to register to vote remained midnight on November 23, 2018. Voters who were sent a voting package but did not receive it, or who need a replacement voting package, could request a replacement package up to December 7. All ballots must have been received by Elections BC by 4:30pm on December 7. In response to a question from a constituent on Twitter, Elections BC clarified that ballots received by Elections BC's Referendum Service Offices or Service BC Centres up to and including 4:30pm on December 7, 2018, but which had not been physically transferred to Elections BC's counting centre, would be accepted and counted as valid ballots.
Post-referendum plans.
The government had plans for the required next steps had proportional representation passed. However, as it did not pass, the government did not implement any of these. Had a proportional system been adopted, the independent BC Electoral Boundaries Commission would have determined the number and location of new electoral districts. A legislative committee would have been tasked with determining whether the number of members of the Legislative Assembly should increase, and if so by how many (to a maximum of an additional eight). Some other aspects of how the new system would have worked would have also needed to be determined by a legislative committee.
If a form of proportional representation had been adopted, the government had also committed to holding a further confirming referendum after two general elections. Voters in that future referendum would have had the option of maintaining the form of proportional representation adopted or switching back to the first-past-the-post electoral system. On October 2, 2018, the government introduced legislation to enact the requirement for this second referendum into law. If a change from the first-past-the-post system had been adopted in 2018, the bill would have required a second referendum on electoral reform to occur within 13 months of the second provincial general election held under the chosen proportional representation voting system (no later than November 30, 2026). As voters decided to keep the existing first-past-the-post system, this second referendum will not take place.
Opinion polls.
Question 1.
Referendum-style binary questionQuestion: "Based on what you know, please indicate which of these two broad options you prefer for BC"
Multiple choice question allowing undecideds and opt-outs (options 3–5 will not be present on ballot)Question: "Based on how you feel right now, if you were to receive a voting package, which way would you vote on the first question?"
Results.
On December 20, 2018, Elections BC announced that 61.3% of ballots were cast to maintain the first-past-the-post voting system.
A total of 1,391,423 ballots were considered. There were 1,378,753 valid votes for Question 1, and 831,760 valid votes for Question 2. 2,461 ballots were rejected.
Question 1.
The existing first-past-the-post voting system received a majority of votes with 61.30% (845,235) of the valid votes for Question 1. As a result, no electoral reform was approved.
Question 1: Which system should British Columbia use for provincial elections?
Question 2.
Per the Electoral Reform Referendum 2018 Regulation, STV rules were in effect to find the winner in Question 2 (although the question was moot as no electoral reform would take place as per the result of Question 1). Thus, when no system won a majority of first preferences, a second round of counting was required for Question 2. RUP had the fewest first preferences, so it was eliminated and its votes were transferred to the second preferences marked on the ballots. In the second count, the mixed-member proportional voting system had the most support on Question 2.
Question 2: If British Columbia adopts a proportional representation voting system, which of the following voting systems do you prefer?

Bukalapak

Bukalapak () is an Indonesian e-commerce company. It was founded in 2010 as an online marketplace to enable small and medium enterprises go online and has expanded to support smaller traditional family owned businesses (warungs).
As of 2019, the company has more than 4.5 million SME sellers, 70 million monthly active users, 1.9 million warung partners, and averaging two million transactions per day. It is one of the largest e-commerce company in Indonesia and was the fourth unicorn startup in Indonesia. Bukalapak's planned IPO in 2021 aims to raise up to US$1.5 billion, which would make it the largest listing ever on the Indonesian Stock Exchange.
History.
Bukalapak was founded in 2010 by Achmad Zaky with two of his college friends from Bandung Institute of Technology, Fajrin Rasyid and Nugroho Herucahyono. Bukalapak's first major success was when folding bicycles started trending in 2010. At that time there were many communities selling various types of bikes and biking accessories, which played a significant role in increasing Bukalapak's users.
The nickname "Pelapak" is a common term used to call the sellers in Bukalapak.
In 2019, Bukalapak laid off hundreds of employees. The layoffs were the result of an adjustment in strategy and efficiency improvements. The company is discontinuing its smart retail and internet-of-things divisions leading to job cuts among engineers. The startup also shed some marketing roles because of overexpansion, but core functions like digital marketing remain unaffected.
Finances.
Less than a year after being founded, Bukalapak received an additional capital from Batavia Incubator (a merged company from Rebright Partners, led by Takeshi Ebihara from Japanese Incubator and Corfina Group). In 2012, Bukalapak received another additional investment from GREE Ventures led by Kuan Hsu.
In March 2014, Bukalapak announced that it received an investment by Aucfan, IREP, 500 Startups, and GREE Ventures.
From Emtek's 2015 financial statements (49% owners of Bukalapak shares), it is known that Bukalapak has obtained investment fund from Emtek totaling up to Rp 439 billion. However, in 2015, Bukalapak is still losing Rp 229 billion, with revenues of Rp 6.4 billion.
In January 2019, Bukalapak announced an undisclosed funding round by Mirae Asset-Naver Asia Growth Fund, a joint venture between Seoul-based Mirae Financial Group and Naver, the company behind LINE messaging service.
Shareholders.
As of 31 July 2021.

Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Center

The Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Center is a museum in Niagara Falls, New York, based on the history and legacy of the Underground Railroad. Opened in 2018, it is located on the first floor of a historic former U.S. Customhouse built in 1863 at the Niagara Falls Station and Customhouse Interpretive Center.
History.
The idea of commemorating the Underground Railroad in Niagara Falls picked up steam in 2007 when former City Council Chairman Charles A. Walker and Kevin E. Cottrell pitched an idea they called "North Star on North Main." Funding from New York State began in 2008, when the State Legislature created the Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Commission to work on an Underground Railroad museum in Niagara Falls. The following year, a state law governing Niagara Falls' use of Seneca Niagara Casino money was amended to give the commission $350,000 a year, a figure that was reduced to $200,000 a year in 2011.
Opened on May 4, 2018, the museum is sanctioned by the National Park Service as part of the Niagara Falls National Heritage Area and is operated in a partnership between the National Park Service and the Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Commission.
Exhibits.
Described as an experiential museum, the museum includes such exhibits as "One More River to Cross" featuring the history of the Underground Railroad in Niagara Falls, the role played by the location and geography of Niagara Falls, and the actions of residents particularly African-American residents. Other exhibits include a recreation of the Cataract House, a Niagara Falls hotel that employed an entirely African-American wait staff, who helped numbers of former slaves to freedom in Canada and a recreation of the International Suspension Bridge, built in 1848, and rebuilt in 1855 to incorporate rail traffic, where Harriet Tubman and other former slaves crossed into Canada.
In 2019, "One More River to Cross" won an Award of Excellence by the American Association for State and Local History (AASLH).

Coiled-coil domain containing 74a

Coiled-coil domain containing 74A is a protein that in humans is encoded by the CCDC74A gene. The protein is most highly expressed in the testis and may play a role in developmental pathways. The gene has undergone duplication in the primate lineage within the last 9 million years, and its only true ortholog is found in Pan troglodytes.
Gene.
The gene locus is located on the long arm of chromosome 2 at 2q21.1, and spans 5991 base pairs.
A common alternative alias is LOC90557.
Transcript.
The mRNA encoding the largest peptide product, isoform 6, contains 8 exons and 9 introns. It is 1842bps in length. Altogether, 11 protein isoforms have been characterized as a result of alternative splicing.
Protein.
The longest CCDC74A peptide product, isoform 6, is 420 amino acids in length. This protein has a predicted molecular weight of 45.9kD and a predicted isoelectric point of 10.65. The entire length of the protein is evenly enriched in lysine and arginine residues. The protein contains 2 eukaryotic coiled-coil domains of unknown function, CCDC92 and CCDC74C. Its predicted localization is to the nucleus, but the protein may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm due to the presence of both a nuclear localization signal and a nuclear export signal.
Secondary structure.
Predicted secondary structure for CCDC74A consists of 4 alpha helix regions, which are summarized in the table below and the diagram to the right.
Post-translational modification.
A threonine residue (T395) which is highly conserved across Animalia orthologs may serve as a phosphorylation site by PKG kinase. Additionally, SUMOylation, methylation, and acetylation sites are predicted within highly conserved regions and may play a part in regulation. These predicted post-translational modifications and conserved domains are summarized in the diagram to the right.
Homology.
In humans, CCDC74A has one important paralog, CCDC74B. Gene duplication is estimated to have occurred approximately 7 million years ago (MYA). As such, the only true ortholog of CCDC74A is found in Pan troglodytes, and is not found in Gorilla gorilla. However, distant orthologs prior to gene duplication are conserved in species that diverged from humans between 92-797 MYA. This includes species as distant as Cnidaria, but excludes Porifera or species outside of the kingdom Animalia.
Function.
CCDC74A localization, expression, and interactions suggest that the protein may play a role in the expression of genes related to developmental and differentiation pathways, particularly during spermatogenesis.
Expression.
The protein has been found most highly expressed in the testes and trachea. It is also expressed at moderate levels in the lung, brain, prostate, spinal cord, bone marrow, ovary, thymus, and thyroid gland.
Interactions.
Consistent with predicted post-translational methylation, CCDC74A has been shown to interact with the lysine demethylase KDM1A through a yeast 2-hybrid assay. Additionally, through a yeast 2-hybrid assay, CCDC74A has been shown to interact with the lymphocyte activation molecule associated protein SH2D1A.
Clinical significance.
In a study on androgen-independent prostate cancer, knockout of CCDC74A in androgen-dependent prostate cancer inhibited cell proliferation. Experiments in genital fibroblast cells have shown that CCDC74A expression significantly increases upon exposure to dihydrotestosterone.

Ukiyo-e Ruikō

The "Ukiyo-e Ruikō" (, "Various Thoughts on Ukiyo-e") is a Japanese collection of commentaries and biographies of ukiyo-e artists. It did not appear in print during the Edo period in which it was produced, but was circulated in handwritten copies subject with numerous additions and alterations. The writer Ōta Nanpo produced the first version in 1790.
More than 120 variants of the "Ukiyo-e Ruikō" are known. An edition with updates by Santō Kyōden, Sasaya Shishichi Kuninori, and Shikitei Sanba in 1802 is the earliest extant copy, produced under the title "Ukiyo-e Kōshō". This version lists 37 artists and focuses mainly on ukiyo-e painters and major print designers.
The "Ukiyo-e Ruikō" ranks artists regarded for their paintings higher than those mainly associated with their print designs, and highlights artists training in painterly schools such as the Kanō or painting traditions such as Yamato-e, suggesting the prestige painting held over printing.

Jackie O's Pub &amp; Brewery

Jackie O's Pub &amp; Brewery, often abbreviated to Jackie O's, is a craft brewery located in Athens, Ohio. Founded in 2005, its beer has been internationally recognized. Its business practices place emphasis on benefiting the local community by buying local foods, using renewable energy sources, and encouraging tourism to the city where it was founded.
Founding and growth.
It was founded in 2005 by Brad Clark and Art Oestrike, both alumni of Ohio University, which is also located in Athens.
The name "Jackie O's" was chosen to pay homage to the Irish-inspired brewpub that occupied the building before its purchase, as well as in honor of Oestrike's mother Jackie, who passed away shortly after they purchased the premises.
Oestrike is the owner of Jackie O's, while Clark's role is head brewer.
Their first location only had two fermentors, limiting their output to approximately 300 barrels annually.
In 2009, Jackie O's acquired the bar immediately adjacent to theirs, calling it Jackie O’s Public House.
They used the larger kitchen of the Public House to expand their menu offerings, and they also had the space to increase their brewing capacity.
Annual beer production rose from 300 barrels to 800 barrels.
In 2013, Jackie O's expanded their business to another location in the city of Athens.
The new location was primarily a production facility, increasing their output from 800 barrels to 3,200 barrels annually.
From 2013 to 2017, their annual growth rate exceeded 20%.
Beers.
Jackie O's Pub &amp; Brewery has several "flagship" beers that are consistently available year-round, including a raspberry-flavored wheat beer ("Razz Wheat"), an amber ale ("Firefly"), a honey nut brown ale ("Chomolungma"), an IPA ("Mystic Mama"), and a rye IPA ("Hop Ryot").
In 2008, Jackie O's gained the capacity to begin brewing barrel-aged beers.
In 2017, Jackie O's launched into production of sour beers with a designated brewing space constructed for the expansion.
In 2017, Clark described their current output composition as 50–60% IPAs.
"Mystic Mama" is their most popular beer, followed by "Razz Wheat."
Jackie O's barrel-aged beers have attracted a wide following, with Hop Culture website calling them "one of the greatest producers of barrel-aged stouts...in the country" and "Paste" magazine saying "we’ve yet to have a barrel-aged beer from them that wasn’t impressive."
Distribution.
Jackie O's began canning its beers for distribution in 2013, starting with "Firefly Amber" and "Chomolungma."
They were the second craft beer brewery in Ohio to begin canning, after MadTree Brewing Company.
Jackie O's brewed 13,000 barrels of beer in 2016 and planned on brewing 17,000 barrels in 2017.
As of 2017, 97% of all beer produced by Jackie O's was sold in the State of Ohio.
Their distribution currently includes a few counties in Kentucky.
Oestrike and Clark have expressed interest in containing their growth mostly to the State of Ohio.
Clark stated, "Staying within the state is sustainable. There’s a reduced carbon footprint but there’s also keeping money within the state, whether it’s going to the distributor or the retailer, the consumer is spending their money in Ohio and we’re bringing people in from outside of Ohio. It’s building and strengthening everything around us and within us."
Oestrike and Clark estimate that the sale of Jackie O's beer creates at least $550-$600,000 (USD) annually for the State of Ohio via sales tax.
Awards and recognition.
In 2015, Jackie O's won several awards at the Dublin Craft Beer Cup, an international competition, taking a silver medal for their "Rum Barrel Oil of Aphrodite" and a bronze medal for "Bourbon Barrel Dark Apparition."
In 2017, Jackie O's was ranked as RateBeer's best pub in Ohio, best taproom in Ohio, and top brewery in Ohio.
One of Jackie O's beers—its Iced Coffee Apparition, an imperial stout aged on ground coffee beans—was ranked as RateBeer's best beer in Ohio in 2017.
"Paste" magazine named Jackie O's as one of their top 10 breweries of 2017.
In 2018, Jackie O's was one of two Ohio breweries included on RateBeer's list of 100 best breweries in the world.
Also in 2018, Thrillist listed Jackie O's as the best craft brewery in Ohio.
Jackie O's beer has received positive reviews from online publications, with "Mystic Mama" placing in "Draft" magazine's top 50 IPAs in the United States, "Pockets of Sunlight" ranking #3 in "Paste's" list of 116 best saisons, and "Spirit Beast" ranking #2 on "Paste's" list of 144 best barrel-aged imperial stouts.
The Union Street Fire and aftermath.
In November 2014, Jackie O's sustained heavy damages in the Union Street Fire, losing the roof of one of its properties.
Jackie O's Public House, its 2009 acquisition, remained standing, but had severe smoke and water damage.
Though Clark initially expressed fears that the Public House would have to be condemned, the building was able to be rehabilitated.
The Public House reopened with limited business hours less than a month later, though it was unable to serve hot food due to extensive kitchen damage.
Clark expressed gratitude that the fire did not do more damage, stating that if the brewpub (the initial location) had been destroyed "we would’ve never reopened either spot.”
The Public House resumed normal operating hours with a fully operational kitchen shortly after April 2016.
The Union Street Fire resulted in approximately 70 lost jobs in total due to destroyed and damaged businesses, including more than 40 employees of Jackie O's.
Business practices.
Jackie O's receives about half of its energy from solar panels installed at its brewery.
Of the renewable energy investment, Oestrike said, "Our eventual goal is 100 percent sustainability."
They also support the consumption of local food, and sell several food products in their establishments from farms within of the city of Athens.
Jackie O's is the owner of Barrel Ridge Farm, one of the local farms that supplies produce for their food menu.
Jackie O's produces most of the baked goods sold as part of their menu offerings at their Public House, such as pizza crusts and hamburger buns.
Baked goods are created with the spent grain byproduct of their brewing operation.
Other spent grain byproduct is turned into mulch for Barrel Ridge Farm so that none of it is wasted.
Jackie O's flagship beer can labels are designed by local artist Brynn Perrott (known professionally as "deerjerk") from Morgantown, West Virginia.
Relationship with the community.
Former mayor of Athens Steve Patterson spoke highly of the brewery, saying, “In terms of economic impact, Jackie O’s is a heavy lifter in the city. They’re an integral part of Athens, not only in what they’re producing, but in creating jobs. They’ve created more than 100 jobs as they’ve grown.”
Jackie O's is in the top 10 employers in the county by number of employees.
In 2016, they had 127 employees, 64 of which were full-time.
While their "flagship" beers are widely-available in the state of Ohio, Jackie O's periodically has limited-edition bottle releases available only at the brewery itself to spur tourism to the city.
Oestrike has used his platform as an entrepreneur to be an instructor at Ohio University.
He has taught Business Relations and Communication Skills, where students learn how to work together and create solutions to real-world problems.
Jackie O's has also been in talks with Ohio University to host a brewing science course, though this has yet to transpire.

HackRF One

HackRF One is a wide band software defined radio (SDR) half-duplex transceiver created and manufactured by Great Scott Gadgets. Its creator, Michael Ossmann, launched a successful KickStarter campaign in 2014 with a first run of the project called HackRF (Project Jawbone). The hardware and software's open source nature has attracted hackers, amateur radio enthusiasts, and information security practitioners.
Overview.
The HackRF One is capable of receiving and transmitting on a frequency range of 1MHz to 6GHz with output power of 30 mW to 1 mW depending on the band. The unit comes with an SMA antenna port, CLKIN/CLKOUT SMA ports and a 2.0 USB port. The HackRF One integrates with GNU Radio and SDR# projects to provide its graphical user interface. The popularity of HackRF One as a security research platform has made it featured in many information security conference talks such as BlackHat, DEF CON and BSides.
Academic research.
Kimmo Heinäaro presented a paper at the 2015 International Conference on Military Communications and Information Systems (ICMCIS) outlining how military tactical communications could be hacked with HackRF One and other open source tools.
In 2017, researchers were able to use HackRF One in a GPS spoofing attack to feed a vehicle false signals and mapping data to deliver the occupants to a desired location.
Media attention.
The HackRF One has received criticism in several media reports because it can be used to intercept and replay the key fob signals to open car and garage doors.

Rasinia gens

The gens Rasinia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. Hardly any members of this gens are mentioned in history, but a number are known from inscriptions. In imperial times a Gaius Rasinius Silo was governor of Noricum.
Origin.
From the large number of inscriptions mentioning the Rasinii in and around Etruria, and especially from Arretium and Pisae, as well as the surnames "Pisanus" and "Pisaurensis", referring to members who were natives of Pisae and of the Etruscan colony at Pisaurum, it seems beyond doubt that the Rasinii were Etruscans, and that their nomen, "Rasinius", must be derived from the Etruscan "Rasenna", the Etruscan name for their own culture.
Praenomina.
The chief praenomina of the Rasinii were "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Marcus", with "Decimus" and "Sextus" being used to a lesser extent. "Lucius", "Gaius", and "Marcus" were the three most common names throughout Roman history, while "Sextus" was fairly common, and "Decimus" somewhat more distinctive. Other names occur infrequently among the Rasinii, although examples of "Publius", "Quintus", and "Titus" are known.

Synergini

Synergini is a tribe of tropical gall wasps in the subfamily Cynipinae. 
Genera.
The following genera are generally accepted within Synergini:
All of these except "Lithosaphonecrus" and "Rhoophilus" are found in the eastern Palearctic realm. "Synergus" has the greatest number of species in Synergini.
A reworking of the entire Cynipidae family published in 2015 transferred three genera formerly included in Synergini to other tribes - "Ceroptres" to a tribe of its own (Ceroptresini), and "Periclistus" and "Synophromorpha" to Diastrophini.
Gall use.
Members of Synergini have lost the ability to create their own galls, and instead make use of galls left behind by other wasps. As a result, they are classified as inquilines. Species in Synergini usually make use of galls left by wasps in tribe Cynipini.

Bom Diggy

Bom Diggy is a song by British singers Zack Knight and Jasmin Walia. It was released on 24 August 2017 through the Artist Originals subsidiary of Saavn Music and YouTube. The main verses are sung in Punjabi and English, while the sampled chorus is in Bengali. The single was serviced to iTunes, Spotify and SoundCloud at the same day. A remix version by Dillon Francis was released on 31 January 2018.
Later, Zack Knight made a remake of this song as "Bom Diggy Diggy" for the Indian film "Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety", which was released on 8 February 2018 through T-Series, and produced by Knight and Yo Yo Honey Singh. As of April 2021, both versions of the song have over 820 million combined views on YouTube.
Background.
On 15 August 2017, Zack Knight released a trailer for the single. Described as "The US police team was searching Zack Knight and Jasmin Walia for stolen money from the bank. Later, seem they was counting the money." The video background was at party club. Background music was composed by Zack Knight. The music tune was made with unique bits, with some English rap. A remake version of this song had changed some lyrics with Knight's vocals and made more Punjabi bits with heavy EDM. The chorus of the song samples vocals from a Bengali folk song, found in a "Voice of India" sample pack.
Critical reception.
Kat Bein of Billboard wrote: "This track is a super-catchy tune that already featured some great electro elements over its Indian influence." Dillon Francis said, "It's great to see that the original 'Bom Diggy' single was one of the biggest tracks of last year. The remix is a great way to be involved in something with cross-cultural appeal and it's exciting to be involved with a platform that supports independent artists."
Music video.
The Bom Diggy official music video was released on 24 August 2017 on YouTube. The video was directed by Luke Biggins, Roger Russell and Knight himself. The music video starred Knight and Jasmine Walia. The video is about dancing, where Knight and Walia had performed to this song. The official music video has over 100 million views on YouTube as of April 2021.
The version of the song in "Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety" has a quite different music video, used in the film. Both music videos, along with the lyric video, have received over 960 million views on YouTube as of April 2021.

N-Desmethylapalutamide

"N"-Desmethylapalutamide is a nonsteroidal antiandrogen (NSAA) and the major active metabolite of apalutamide, an NSAA which is used as a hormonal antineoplastic agent in the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer. It has similar activity to that of apalutamide and, with apalutamide therapy, circulates at similar concentrations to those of apalutamide at steady state. "N"-Desmethylapalutamide is formed from apalutamide in the liver by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4.

Daily Journal (Wheaton, Illinois)

The Daily Journal was a daily newspaper in Wheaton, Illinois that published for almost 60 years, from 1933 until 1992. In its final two decades, it was published by Copley Newspapers and had a final circulation of 7,650. Its origins were in a weekly newspaper founded in 1910 called the "DuPage County Tribune".
History.
The "Daily Journal"’s forerunner, the "DuPage County Tribune", began publishing in 1910 and was owned and published by John L. Brown.
In early 1913, two men, George H. Smith and George M. Smith, purchased the newspaper and renamed it the "Wheaton Progressive". George H. Smith formerly had been the foreman of the paper, and after buying it became its publisher. Meanwhile, George M. Smith was named managing editor. In its earliest years, the paper’s offices were at 117 E. Front Street in Wheaton. By the 1930s — and well into the 1950s — the paper’s offices were at 110 E. Wesley Street in Wheaton.
On April 24, 1933, the Smiths launched a new, afternoon daily newspaper, the "Daily Journal", which identified itself as the first daily newspaper to be published in DuPage County, Illinois. The banner at the top of the paper's front page stated: "Published by the Wheaton Progressive." The "Wheaton Progressive" kept publishing, but after several weeks, the "Wheaton Progressive" was discontinued and effectively merged into the "Daily Journal". On June 6, 1933, the "Daily Journal" wrote that "Today's Journal comes to you as the first issue of the consolidation of the Daily Journal and the Wheaton Progressive. Postoffice (sic) requirements have been complied with for the merger and also the state law requiring the publication of notices has been adhered to in every way. So today The Wheaton Daily Journal comes to you as a regular legitimate newspaper."
Editor and publisher George M. Smith died in 1949 at age 64.
Dear Publication &amp; Radio acquired the "Daily Journal" in March 1953 for $104,000.
In late 1953, the paper did not publish for five straight days after a strike of eight printers and pressmen.
In January 1971, Copley Newspapers began operating the "Daily Journal". Under the arrangement, Copley assumed the management and publishing of the Journal under a lease arrangement, starting with the January 15, 1971 issue. Copley Newspapers eventually acquired the paper outright. Prior to Copley's takeover, Dear Publication had been producing the paper via a printed photo offset process. With the Copley takeover, the paper began being produced in a letterpress plant operated by Copley in Elgin, Illinois for Copley’s Elgin "Courier-News" daily.
By the early 1970s, the "Daily Journal"'s offices were at 362 S. Schmale Road in Carol Stream, Illinois.
In 1991, Copley Newspapers acquired the "Naperville Sun" newspaper and its Sun Publications parent. In 1992, Copley decided to change the "Daily Journal"’s name to simply the "Journal" and shift its publishing schedule to twice a week as part of merging the Daily Journal into the operations of the Sun Publications. The paper’s final editor in chief was Pat Colander, and its final managing editor was William Currie.
In its final years, the communities that the "Daily Journal" covered were Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, Carol Stream, Glendale Heights, Winfield, West Chicago and Warrenville.
Notable people.

Bettiola Heloise Fortson

Bettiola Heloise Fortson (December 29, 1890 – April 13, 1917) was an African-American poet, essayist, activist and suffragist. Fortson was one of the first African-American people in the Midwestern United States to write and publish a book.
Biography.
Bettiola Heloise Fortson was born December 29, 1890 in Hopkinsville, Kentucky to Mattie Arnold and James Fortson. At age 12, she moved to Chicago to live with her aunt but she would periodically move to Evansville, Indiana to live with her mother when her aunt was traveling. She graduated in 1910 from Clark Street High School in Evansville, Indiana and returned to live in Chicago after graduation.
Fortson was a co-founder and president of the University Society of Chicago, a women's club (that included men in membership) that fostered literary studies and had a primary focus on "artistic and intellectual development" amongst African-Americans. Fortson was an active member and second vice president of the Alpha Suffrage Club, the first black women's suffrage association. For two years she was an organizer for City Federation of Colored Women's Clubs.
She was the author of the 1915 book, "Mental Pearls: original poems and essays", published by Julius F. Taylor. In order to raise money for the publishing of her book, she was offered to publish her poems in The Broad Ax, a weekly African-American newspaper in Chicago. The newspaper sent 500 copies of the paper to sell at the National Federation of Colored Women's Clubs that year and they allowed the proceeds to go to Fortson. Her poems were included in the book, "Six Poets of Racial Uplift," published in 1996 by G K Hall.
Fortson died from tuberculosis at her home 3413 Prairie Avenue in Chicago, Illinois on April 13, 1917, at the age of 26. Her eulogy was read by Ida B. Wells. She was buried at the Mount Forest Cemetery in Thornton, Illinois, which was primarily an African-American cemetery.

Cataract House

The Cataract House was a hotel in the neighborhood of Buffalo Avenue in Niagara Falls, New York. The hotel was established in 1825 but destroyed by fire in 1945. It was a major stop on the Underground Railroad and it was the largest hotel in Niagara Falls. The hotel's name infers to large and powerful waterfall next to property.
History.
The Cataract House Hotel was built on the Niagara River bank in 1825 by owner David Chapman. The land for the hotel near what is now Old Main Street and Buffalo Avenue between Red Coach Inn and Niagara Falls State Park was originally owned by Judge Samuel DeVeaux. In 1831, Parkhurst Whitney purchased the hotel and ran it for several years. Whitney later leased the hotel to a corporation run by his son, Solon Whitney (who owned the Whitney Mansion in Niagara Falls), and sons-in-law, James Fullerton Trott and Dexter Ray Jerauld.
After Whitney's death in 1862, his son Solon owned the Hotel until 1891 when it was sold to Peter A. Porter (who served as a U.S. Representative from 1907 to 1909). Porter was the son of Peter Augustus Porter, who was the only son of Gen. Peter Buell Porter of War of 1812 fame. The Porter family sold the hotel to John McDonald in 1909, who owned it until 1945.
Cataract House, which became "the most elegant and popular hotel on the American side," was host to Abraham Lincoln, Jenny Lind, Horace Greeley, William Seward, Franklin D. Roosevelt, King Edward VII (when he was the Prince of Wales), and King George V in 1939.
The hotel, which by then had occupied an entire city block was across the street from Red Coach Inn, was destroyed by fire in 1945. 
The site today is Heritage Park located between Buffalo Avenue and Riverway with roadway providing access to the Niagara Reservation – Niagara Falls State Park.
History with the Underground Railroad.
The Cataract House employed an entirely African-American wait staff, who helped numbers of former slaves to freedom in Canada.
In 2018, a model of the hotel was constructed at the Niagara Falls Underground Railroad Heritage Center to highlight its history and importance to the Underground Railroad and the history of Niagara Falls.

Quintus Plautius

Quintus Plautius was a Roman senator, who was active during the Principate. He was consul "ordinarius" for the year 36 as the colleague of Sextus Papinius Allenius. Nothing more is known about his senatorial career.
He was the son of Aulus Plautius suffect consul in 1 BC, and Vitellia, possibly the great-aunt of the future Roman emperor Aulus Vitellius. Quintus had an older brother, Aulus Plautius suffect consul in 29 and conqueror of Roman Britain, and a sister, Plautia, who has been identified as the wife of Publius Petronius, consul in 19 AD. 
Although the name of his wife is not known, Quintus Plautius has been identified as the father of Plautius Lateranus, who was accused of an affair with Valeria Messalina in 48 AD, and was executed in 65 AD for involvement in the Pisonian conspiracy. Another Aulus Plautius has been proposed to be his son. Suetonius writes that this man was murdered by Nero during the purges following the death of Poppaea Sabina in 65. Nero, before he put Aulus Plautius to death, subjected him to oral rape, after which he is said to have gloated, 'Now let my mother go and kiss my successor'; the suggestion being that Agrippina (though she had been murdered in 59 AD) had encouraged him to take Nero's position as Emperor.

Ernest Septimus Reynolds

Ernest Septimus Reynolds FRCP (7 April 1861 – 22 May 1926) was emeritus professor of clinical medicine at the University of Manchester. In 1900 he wrote "An Epidemic of Peripheral Neuritis Amongst Beer Drinkers in Manchester and District" for the "British Medical Journal", the first of a series of papers which caused a national sensation when they revealed the presence of dangerous levels of arsenic in local beer.
Early life and family.
Reynolds was born in Manchester on 7 April 1861, the son of J.H. Reynolds. He received his early education at the Manchester Commercial Schools and Owens College, and subsequently completed the Victoria BSc prior to entering medicine. He won the Platt physiological exhibition and qualified from the University of London in 1883.
He was married to Rosa Maud, daughter of Thomas Hooker, and they had one daughter.
Medical career.
After qualifying, Reynolds took up posts at the Macclesfield County Asylum, the Cheadle Royal Asylum, the West Riding Asylum and the Manchester Royal Infirmary where he became resident medical officer (1887–1891). He was admitted a member of the Royal College of Physicians in 1888 and became a fellow in 1896. In 1891, he became honorary physician at the Ancoats Hospital and physician to the Manchester Workhouse Infirmary, a position he held for some time. In 1892 he became lecturer in hygiene at the Lancashire County Council. During the First World War, Reynolds served as a lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps. He was professor of clinical medicine (part-time) at the university from 1913 to 1921; he retired from the university as emeritus professor.
Reynolds is best known for being the first to identify dangerous levels of arsenic in beer brewed in the Manchester area, which he revealed in a 1900 paper for the "British Medical Journal" titled "An Epidemic of Peripheral Neuritis Amongst Beer Drinkers in Manchester and District", the first of a series of papers on the subject. The discovery caused a national sensation. The conclusion did not come easily, and there were many confounding factors. In 1901, he co-authored along with Ronald Ross, an article demonstrating a similarity between beriberi and alcoholic neuritis, and "it seemed that some of the beriberi cases might also be due to arsenic poisoning". This led to widespread discussion among tropical disease experts as to whether the neuropathies seen were due to beriberi.
Described as private and even externally cool, Reynolds could be passionate about causes in which he believed strongly. Among these were the need for physicians not to rely too much on technology at the expense of close observation of the patient at the bedside when making a diagnosis, and the National Insurance Act 1911 to which he was vehemently opposed and against which he spoke at a public rally.
In October 1920, Reynolds gave his presidential lecture for the section of neurology of the Royal Society of Medicine on the causes of nervous diseases, using the same classification he had proposed in his Bradshaw Lecture of 1917.
Death and legacy.
Reynolds died on 22 May 1926 from "acute influenzal pneumonia". He received an obituary of over two pages in the "British Medical Journal" and is profiled in Munk's Roll. He left an estate of £30,183 with probate being granted to his widow, his solicitor, and Archibald Donald, consulting surgeon at the MRI.

Ufo is a genus of gall wasps in the tribe Synergini, first discovered in Japan. Its genus name "Ufo" comes from the common phrase "unidentified flying object", in this case applied because the researchers did not know what the wasp was when they first saw it.

Four species are currently classified within "Ufo".
"Saphonecrus shirakashii" and "S. shirokashicola" were formerly placed in "Ufo", but further research indicated they were better placed in "Saphonecrus".

Dandupalya 3

Dandupalya 3 or 3 is a 2018 Indian Kannada-language crime thriller film directed by Srinivasa Raju and produced by Ram Talluri. Based on the infamous dacoit gang from Dandupalya, the film is a sequel to the 2017 critically acclaimed film "Dandupalya 2" and is third film in the series. The film stars Pooja Gandhi, continuing her role from the prequels and most of the principal cast including P. Ravishankar, Makarand Deshpande, Sanjjanaa, Ravi Kale and Petrol Prasanna reprise their roles from the previous films. The film's score and soundtrack is composed by Arjun Janya and cinematography by Venkat Prasad. The film is dubbed into Telugu language and is entitled "Dandupalyam 3". Much of the crew members have been retained for the film from the prequels apart from roping in Naveen Krishna, Tabla Nani, Ramesh and Gururaj Desai to pen the dialogues. The film would mark the end of the franchise.
Most parts of the film were shot simultaneously during the Part 2 filming, while the second schedule of shooting was held from April 2017. Initially planned to release within a week after the Part 2 release, the film however, released on 16 March 2018.
The film opened to mixed reviews from the audience and critics upon the release in both Karnataka and Andra Pradesh, but earned good collection report from the 'B' and 'C' centres with almost packed houses across the states and emerged as a sleeper hit at box office.
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by Arjun Janya.
Critical reception.
The writer Sunayana Suresh of "The Times of India", rated the film 3/5 and stated "It is advisable for one to watch the first two parts of the film to understand what the style of filmmaking is. Nothing is mellowed down, and there crude criminals and officers are shown as is. P Ravi Shankar steals the show as the ghastly cop on a mission to make these heartless criminals confess to their crimes. Pooja Gandhi in her uninhibited avatar is another person who deserves applause. Makarand Deshpande evokes fear, while the rest of the cast stay true to their parts."
The writer of "Chtraloka", rated 3.5/5 and stated "Terrifying account of Dandupalya crimeIII, part three of the film on the Dandupalya gang's crime is a terrifying account of the ways and Director Srinivas Raju has made a film that will shock and scare people about how this gang was captured and brought to book."
The writer of "Cinema Express", rated 3/5 and stated that "Pooja Gandhi wins over the audience with her powerful performance, while Makarand Deshpande gets deep into the character's skin. Ravi Shankar is an all-rounder and makes no mistakes in getting into the police avatar. Shruthi, Kari Subbu, Ravi Kale, and Danny are all well chosen for their roles and do justice to them. Arjun Janya’s background score is haunting and complements the script well."
The writer of "Telangana Today", called it 'A package of spine-chilling scenes' and stated that "Director Srinivasa Raju does well in his raw presentation of crimes committed by Dandupalyam gang and some of the spine-chilling scenarios are aptly supported with the background score of Arjun Janya. The conclusion also is executed well leaving little scope for questions to be raised. On the acting front, Ravi Shankar as police officer Chalapathi wins accolades while other leads, Pooja Gandhi and Makarand Deshpande leave a positive mark."
The writer Shyam Prasad of "Bangalore Mirror", stated that "It is a more stylish version of the first part. The cinematography and editing are top class. The stylish presentation, however, does not cover the intent; to shock and awe. Expletives, ample display of cleavage, graphic murders and rapes do the trick. If that excites you, III is for you."
The writer Sharadha of "New Indian Express", rated 3/5 and stated that "Pooja Gandhi wins over the audience with her powerful performance, while Makarand Deshpande gets deep into the character's skin. Ravi Shankar is an all-rounder and makes no mistakes in getting into the police avatar."

<doc id="56636978" url="?curid=56636978" title="Mary Flahive">
Mary Flahive

Mary Elizabeth Flahive (born 1948) is a professor of mathematics at Oregon State University. Her research interests are in number theory;
she is the author of two books on difference equations and Diophantine approximation, and is also interested in the geometry of numbers and algebraic coding theory.
Education.
Flahive graduated from St. Joseph's College in New York in 1969.
She completed her Ph.D. at the Ohio State University in 1976. Her dissertation, "On The Minima Of Indefinite Binary Quadratic Forms", was supervised by Alan C. Woods, and cites the mentorship of another Ohio State mathematician, Jill Yaqub. She published it under the name Mary Flahive Gbur, and some of her journal papers from this period use the name Mary E. Gbur.
Books.
Flahive is the author of the book "The Markoff and Lagrange Spectra", on topics related to Diophantine approximation (with Thomas W. Cusick, Mathematical Surveys and Monographs 30, American Mathematical Society, 1989). She is also the author of an undergraduate textbook on difference equations, "" (with Paul Cull and Robby Robson, Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics, Springer, 2005).
Activism.
Flahive has also been active in the promotion of women in mathematics. She served a five-year term on the Joint Committee On Women In the Mathematical Sciences from 1996 to 2000. With Marie A. Vitulli, she wrote an influential study on patterns of job offers to women with new U.S. Ph.D.s in 1997, and updated the study in 2010. The major differences that both studies found were that, at academic institutions whose highest degree in mathematics is a bachelor's degree, women were initially employed at a substantially higher rate than men, and in business and industry men were initially employed at a considerably higher rate than women. Their study found small differences in hiring at doctorate-granting institutions between men and women, indicating that other points in the career are more critical in explaining the gender gap between men and women in mathematics.

Google Station

Google Station was a Google service that allowed partners to roll out Wi-Fi hotspots in public places by providing software and advice on hardware to turn fiber connections into Wi-Fi. It was only implemented in India and Indonesia but in March 2018, the service was launched in Mexico. In February 2020, Google announced the service would be discontinued. The service went offline on September 30, 2020. RailTel took over the service in India and continues to offer free WiFi at railway stations.
Overview.
Google Station seeks to provide "fast Wi-Fi for everyone". It also highlights that data will be "safe and protected" on Google's network. As it envisions expanding the offering, potential partners include "large venues and organizations, network operators, fiber providers, system integrators, and infrastructure companies". Google Station's advantages include being a simple, easy-to-use solution (both for users as well as partners) that also offers monetization opportunities through advertising (Google Station calls itself "an advertising platform, backed by a world-class advertising sales team and network").
History.
The program was first announced in September 2015, when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Google CEO Sundar Pichai further detailed the plan in a blog post on the Official Google Blog, noting that it would be the "largest public Wi-Fi project in India, and among the largest in the world, by number of potential users".
In January 2016, Google launched the program at the Mumbai Central railway station in India in partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel. RailTel, a state-owned enterprise, provides Internet services as RailWire via its extensive fiber network alongside many of these railway lines. In September 2016, the project was christened "Google Station". In December 2016, Google announced that it had rolled out Google Station at the 100th railway station in India.
Google announced that it was bringing Google Station to Indonesia in partnership with FiberStar and CBN, two Indonesian telecommunications companies that plan on rolling out Wi-Fi hotspots at hundreds of venues across the islands of Java and Bali over the next year.
In January 2018, NDTV reported that Google had started testing a paid model of Google Station, which is slated to reach as many as 400 railway stations in 2018. Later that month, Google announced that for the first time the Google Station projected had expanded beyond railway stations by launching 150 hotspots in Pune. It worked with Larsen &amp; Toubro, India's largest engineering and construction company, and the project is a part of Smart City Pune, a part of India's Smart Cities Mission.
In March 2018 it announced expansion into Mexico, in partnership with the existing SitWifi network.
In July 2018, at the "Google for Nigeria" event, Google station was launched in Lagos with the promise of expanding to 200 locations in 5 cities in the country by 2019.
In February 2019, Google Station was launched in the Philippines, in partnership with Smart.
In June 2019, Google Station was made available in the city of São Paulo, Brazil, with expansion to other Brazilian cities planned. The program in Brazil involves America Net and Linktel as partners, and Itaú as a sponsor.
In November 2019, Google Station was launched in 125 locations around Cape Town, South Africa in partnership with Think WiFi.
In February 2020, Google announced the service would be discontinued, saying that it was "no longer necessary," and "it had become difficult for Google to find a sustainable business model to scale the program." The service went offline on September 30, 2020. In India, RailTel took over the service and continues to offer free WiFi without Google branding.

Kaliyuga Kannan

Kaliyuga Kannan () is a 1974 Indian Tamil-language comedy-drama film directed by Krishnan–Panju. It is based on the play "Sri Krishna Vijayam" written by Vaali. The film stars Jaishankar, Jayachitra, Thengai Srinivasan and Sowcar Janaki. It was later remade in Telugu as " Devudu Digivaste" (1975), in Kannada as "Devara Duddu" (1977), and in Hindi as "Yehi Hai Zindagi" (1977).
Plot.
"Kaliyuga Kannan" is a drama of faith and disbelief in God of a middle-aged couple. It tells of how the man is made to realise on becoming rich that God certainly does not neglect his faithful and wealth only brings sorrow and pain with it. He renounces all his wealth to his son and daughter-in-law and goes back to his old way of living.
Production.
"Kaliyuga Kannan" is the inaugural production of Ajantha Enterprises, and is an adaptation of "Sri Krishna Vijayam", a play written by Vaali that featured Thengai Srinivasan as the protagonist. The play, which was written for actor V. Gopalakrishnan's Gopi Theatres, intended to convey the message that "money could not buy peace of mind". When adapting the play as a film, the makers wanted Sivaji Ganesan as the male lead. But Ganesan suggested Srinivasan, after being impressed with his performance in the play. Vaali wrote the dialogue for the film adaptation, which was produced by N. Elango. Jaishankar and Jayachitra were cast as the male and female lead respectively. Cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao. Besides directing, Panju co-edited the film (alongside Narasimhan) under the pseudonym "Panjabi". The final cut of the film measured .
Soundtrack.
The soundtrack was composed by V. Kumar, while the lyrics were written by Vaali. The playback singers were T. M. Soundararajan, S. P. Balasubrahmanyam, P. Susheela and Renuka. The songs featured were "Kannaiah", "Kadhal Ponnedu", "Jaichutte" and "Seven O'Clock".
Release and reception.
"Kaliyuga Kannan" was released on 13 November 1974, and emerged a commercial success, while propelling Srinivasan to stardom. CV Aravind of "The News Minute" praised it for the "riveting script by Vaali". Playwright and comedian Crazy Mohan developed a desire to write a play with "God as the fulcrum" after watching the play "Krishnaya Thubhyam Namaha", and "Kaliyuga Kannan" encouraged him to solidify his plans, resulting in the play "Chocolate Krishna".

Microtis media" subsp. "densiflora, commonly known as the dense mignonette orchid, is a species of orchid which is endemic to the south–west of Western Australia. It has a single smooth, tubular leaf and a flowering spike with up to one hundred and fifty small yellowish-green flowers. It differs from "Microtis media" subsp. "media" in the shape of its flower spike and the shape of its labellum.
Description.
"Microtis media" subsp. "densiflora" is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, smooth, tubular leaf long and wide. Between twenty and one hundred and fifty small greenish-yellow flowers are crowded along an erect, fleshy flowering stem long. Each flower is long and wide. The dorsal sepal is erect and about long, wide. The lateral sepals are about long, wide and curl downwards. The petals are about long, wide and face forwards. The labellum is thin, long, wide with irregular edges and a small callus. Flowering occurs from October to January.

The last of these has since been raised to species status as "M. quadrata" by David Jones and Mark Clements.
The epithet ("densiflora") is derived from the Latin "densus" (thick, crowded, dense), and "-florus" (-flowered) referring to the dense flower spike.

Lucie Peyraud

Lucie "Lulu" Peyraud (11 December 1917 – 7 October 2020) was a French winemaker and cook.
Biography.
Lucie Tempier was born in Marseille to a family of traders in December 1917. Her father, Alphonse Tempier was a leather importer and owner of the Domaine Tempier vineyard and her mother was Eugénie Roubaud. The family had owned "Domaine Tempier" since 1834.
In 1940, Tempier and her husband, Lucien Peyraud, took charge of a Tempier family farming and wine estate in Le Castellet (Var). The couple kept developing their estate and they and other growers were key in having the Bandol "protected designation of origin" (appellation d'origine contrôlée, AOC) recognized in 1941, and had the ambition of making it one of the great wines of France. By 1943, "Domaine Tempier" released its first bottled wines of rosé, prior to that selling their wine in bulk to wine merchants.
After World War II, Peyraud traveled the world with her husband to learn about foreign wine and techniques, and to promote French wines. Their travels took them to South Africa, Germany, the United States, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Georgia, Greece, Italy, Mexico, and Romania. Lucien Peyraud was the President of the Bandol Wine Association for 37 years from 1945 to 1982. He was also a member of the INAO in 1947 and of the International Organization of the Vine and Wine (OIV), as an auditor in the Oenology Commission.
Despite being the mother of seven children, Lulu Peyraud acted as an ambassador of the wines of Domaine Tempier, often traveling throughout France to present the estate's wines to restaurants and hotels.
Lucie and Lucien repeatedly offered the Tempier Vineyard for the annual Young Cinematography International Meetings (Rencontres Internationales du Jeune Cinéma) in Hyères (1965–1983), as a place for meetings and exchanges for actors and young filmmakers who came to present their films at the festival. In 1983, Lulu participated in the creation of the "Order of the Ladies of the Wine and the Table" (Ordre des Dames du Vin et de la Table), and was its president for three years
Peyraud's typical Provençal recipes earned her a reputation on the other side of the Atlantic amongst well known personalities, such as restaurateur and activist of the "Slow Food" movement, Alice Waters, food critic and writer Richard Olney, writer Jim Harrison, and wine merchant Kermit Lynch.
Richard Olney dedicated an entire book to her cooking in 1994, called "Lulu's Provencal Table: The Exuberant Food and Wine from the Domaine Tempier Vineyard."
Marriage.
She met her husband Lucien Peyraud, a viticulturalist, in 1935 whom she met while he was on holiday in Sanary-sur-Mer. They would marry in 1936. They had seven children, Jean-Marie, François, Fleurine, Colette, Marion, Laurence and Véronique.
Death.
She turned 100 in December 2017 and died in October 2020 at the age of 102. Lucien died in 1996.

Storm-Bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son

"Storm-Bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son" () is a Russian fairy tale ("skazka") #136 collected by Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki", categorized as Aarne-Thompson type 300 A and 519.
"Blast Bogatyr Ivan the Cow's Son" or "Ivan the Cow's Son" are alternative English titles given by other translators.
General information.
"Burya-Bogatyr Ivan-Korovich syn" () is tale #136 in Alexander Afanasyev in "Narodnye russkie skazki". It occurs as tale number 136 "Storm-Bogatyr, Ivan the Cow's Son", in the complete translation by Jack V. Haney (2014). Other translations include "Blast Bogatyr Ivan the Cow's Son" in the dual-language edition by Sergei Levchin (2014), and "Ivan the Cow's Son" translated by Norbert Guterman (1946).
The tale is categorized as AT tale type 300 A and 519. It was recorded in the Orenburg guberniya under Imperial Russia.
Synopsis.
The story begins by explaining how three Ivans were born on the same day: the main hero who was the son of a cow, the prince, and a maidservant's son.
The king of a foreign realm made a worldwide plea for anyone who could make his childless queen pregnant. A certain peasant's son, instructed by a wise old hag, presented the king with a gold-winged pike () netted near the palace. That day, the cow that drank the slop water from the fish the cooks were cleaning, the servant-girl who tasted the fish while carrying the dish, and the queen who was served the dish all conceived a child. The three women came to term simultaneously, and on the same day delivered Ivan the Cow's Son, Ivan Tsarevich the prince, and Ivan the maid's son. The three grew up with exceeding speed beyond the norm.
When they come of age, the three Ivans ask the king to let them go on a journey to see the world. They have a contest throwing a glass marble high up in the air, in order to choose among them the one who should be considered the "senior". Ivan the Cow's Son, called Storm-Bogatyr is victorious. The prince suggests a rematch by competing over who can make the reptile (serpent) of the Black Sea stop its clucking, but no amount of shouting by the other two Ivans perturbs the creature, and it was only the Storm-Bogatyr who made it flee with his shouting and stick-throwing. The other two Ivans are dissatisfied by the outcome, and they part ways, continuing their journey on their own.
The Storm-Bogatyr returns to the kingdom alone and is thrown into the fortress, left starving without food for three days. He demands an explanation of his mistreatment, as he has done nothing wrong, threatening to knock down the walls. The king comes to see him personally, and Ivan assures him the other two son's are alive and well, but have continued their journey by themselves in a place where three serpents with six, nine, and twelve heads appears out of the Black Sea. The Storm-Bogatyr declares only he is capable of tracking them down, and at the king's request, goes in pursuit, armed with his battle club and magic sword (Sword Kladenets, although this sword does not play much of the role in the tale).
The Storm-Bogatyr catches up with his brothers at Kalin Bridge ("blazing bridge", "white hazelwood bridge"). A pillar is marked with a warning-sign that three "zmei" ("serpents", or "dragons") are known to appear at this spot. On the night the six-headed "zmei" is supposed to appear, they cast lots to choose who will stand watch. Although Ivan the Maid's Son is picked, he sleeps through the night, and it is the Storm-Bogatyr who faces off against the six-headed (or "sea-monster") that appears out of the water. The monster summons its horse Sivko-Burko () or "Dun-gray", which stumbles, recognizing the scent of their nemesis, the Storm-Bogatyr. The fight begins, and the hero destroys his foe by knocking off three heads of the enemy at each turn. He hides all the heads under the bridge, while cutting up the corpse and sinking it in the Black Sea. He returns to their hut and ties the captured horse to Ivan Maid's Son, who wakes up in the morning and imagines the horse to be God's gift to him.
The second night, the action is repeated with the appearance of the nine-headed monster. The Storm-Bogatyr gives the captured horse, also called Sivko-Burko but better than the previous, to Ivan the Prince. The third night, the Storm-Bogatyr prepares for a difficult fight, asking his brothers to stay alert, and to come to his aid when there appears the sign that he is imperiled (the candle will falter, and the hanging towel will drip blood into a dish). It is a pitched battle with the twelve-headed. After smiting off six of its heads, the two grapple with each other into exhaustion, until at last the hero strikes off three more heads, but his club is broken in the effort. He then throws his boots to alert his brothers but they do not awaken. He then hurls the broken club, causing the two captured horses to arrive and knock the twelve-headed Chudo-Yudo off its horse, whereupon the Storm-Bogatyr severs the remaining heads.
The brothers could not find trace of the Storm-Bogatyr for three days, and decide to turn back. The Storm-Bogatyr then appears, reproaching them for trying to abandon him so ungratefully, but forgives them. Before leaving, the Storm-Bogatyr decides to double back to the hut where they were lodging ("hut on chicken legs"), and transforms into a fly to eavesdrop on its true residents, the Baba-Yaga, who is the mother of the monsters, and her three daughters-in-law who were married to them. The daughters utter each of their schemes: transforming into a meadow with a well and a bed, an orchard full of fruits, and an old hut, so that when the brothers are enticed to seek respite, they will be blown to bits like poppy seeds.
When the meadow and well, the orchard, and the old hut are encountered, suspiciously out of place in the middle of the steppes and desert, the brothers are lured into resting there or eating the fruits. But Storm-Bogatyr, armed with foreknowledge, warns his brothers off, and smites and cuts the well in the meadow, the trees in the orchards, and the hut (the well and the hut bleed, betraying themselves to be transformations). The brothers gripe about being denied their refreshments, and they part ways again at a fork in the road.
Baba-Yaga turns into a sow and devours the two brothers who went astray. But Storm-Bogatyr who overheard her plans prepares for her attack at a village he entered, hiring twelve blacksmiths to fortify their smithy with an iron plate. When she arrives demanding the blacksmiths to surrender Storm-Bogatyr, they invite her to extend her tongue to snatch him away. When she gullibly does so, Ivan clasps her tongue with a pair of tongs heated red-hot, and the smiths and the hero beat the sow with iron rods until all her ribs are broken. She begs mercy and disgorges the two Ivans, but the hero smashes her into bits.
The three heroes arrive in a kingdom in India, and the Storm-Bogatyr delivers an ultimatum to its king, demanding that he marry his princess to Ivan the Prince, or send out an army to resist. The Storm-Bogatyr annihilates the army with his ladle, and the king is compelled to offer the princess in marriage. During the banquet, the princess transforms into a dove and visits her grandfather with the golden hair and silver beard who emerges from the sea. She asks him to pluck three hairs for her, which she will show to Ivan the Prince to make him guess where the "grass" came from, as a condition for her to marry him. But since Storm-Bogatyr shadowed her in the guise of a falcon, Ivan is able to answer correctly. The Indian princess on her nuptial night attempts to smother Ivan with the pillow, but the Storm-Bogatyr had substituted himself, and he beats her with an iron, copper, and pewter rod until they break, and the princess submits, promising never to make such attempts again. The Storm-Bogatyr now wishes happiness upon Ivan the Prince and his wife, and bids never to forget him.
Magical elements.
Near the location where the three monsters appear, the three brothers discover a "hut on chicken legs" with a rooster's head, with the entrance faced the other way towards the forest, but which swings around and lets them in after the Storm-Bogatyr recites a short incantation. Inside the hut, the table was set with food and drink, and a bed there ready to be slept in. The "hut on chicken legs" is familiar as the abode of the Baba Yaga in Russian fairy tales. After the battle with the twelve-headed monster, the hut is broken into bits, but it repairs itself back into its original condition at Storm-Bogatyr's command.
The Storm-Bogatyr also performs a mysterious ritual, whereby he paces up and down the bridge while tapping it with his cane, until a little pitcher (or water-lily) appears and starts to dance; he then spits on this and smashes it, causing the Chudo-Yudo to immediately appear.
Several characters manifest the ability to transform, including the hero (who turns into a fly and a falcon). One researcher identifies Baba-Yaga's transformation into a sow (wild boar) as "one of the most ancient avatars of the Goddess of the Underworld", and the transformations of her daughters-in-law as representing the themes of life and death.

Jean-Baptiste Lafrenière

Jean-Baptiste Lafrenière (1874 – January 4, 1912) was a Canadian pianist and composer noted for his work in the ragtime genre.
Biography.
Born in Maskinongé, Quebec in 1874, Lafrenière grew up in Montreal and Louiseville before beginning his musical education at the collège Saint-Joseph in Berthierville. He would go on to study at Université Laval in other disciplines before reorienting back towards music in 1893 at 19 years old.
From 1885 to 1898, he gave piano lessons and served as chapelmaster at the Saint-Charles-Borromée church in Joliette and led the local Ceclian Society. He established himself in Montreal, where he played in cabarets and worked in the Théâtre National and the Théâtre Français.
At the beginning of the 20th century, he began to venture into modern musical genres, taking a particular interest in the rise of ragtime in the United States. Collaborating with Léo-Ernest Ouimet, he began his career at Ouimetoscope, where he worked until becoming an accompanist at the Théâtre des Nouveautés.

Charles-Éléonore Dufriche-Desgenettes

Charles-Éléonore Dufriche-Desgenettes (August 10, 1778 in Alençon – April 25, 1860 in Paris) is the founder of the Archconfraternity of the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary.
Biography.
During his youth, Dufriche-Desgenettes revealed a character that was difficult to control, while at the same time one of great courage. In 1792, when his father had approved the Civil Constitution of the Clergy, he was barely 14 years old, and he sided with the unsworn (not government authorized) priests. During his studies in Chartres, he refused to be honored in a public distribution of prizes by a constitutional bishop. At night he visited the unsworn priests in their hiding places, and provided for their needs, such that his activities resulted in the imprisonment of his own father. He did not hesitate to appear before the revolutionary tribunal and ask for his father's release, which he obtained, to the astonishment of all those whom this bold action of his had frightened. Alarmed at the dangers to which he exposed himself with such audacity and boldness, his parents retired to their country home in Saint-Lomer/Courtomer, but his conduct was the same. In 1794, during the fall of Robespierre, he launched an assault on prisons to release the prisoners. He also helped to reopen the churches.
Dufriche-Desgenettes had a long-standing desire to become a priest, which his parents had long opposed. Having finally yielded to his call, he began his theological studies after returning from a forced stay in his native city. He entered the seminary of Sées in 1803, he was ordained a priest on June 9, 1805. He was successively vicar of Saint-Lomer currently known as Courtomer, Le Plantis, Gasprée (currently Aubusson) and Ferrières-la-Verrerie, vicar in Argentan and the parish priest or pastor of Alençon.
Dufriche-Desgenettes administered the sacraments to prisoners during the Spanish war and contracted typhoid fever. When Napoleon I first held Pope Pius VII prisoner at Fontainebleau, he risked his life by serving as a messenger between the Pope and the faithful clergy. During the Hundred Days, he had to go into hiding when the emperor returned to power for having rejoiced too openly at the emperor's fall. He thought briefly of entering the Jesuits, but the latter did not receive him.
Soon after, he became pastor of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, and accomplished so much good in this work, and the public acclaim to his honor and reputation increased so greatly that Monsignor Frayssinous thought for a moment to have him appointed a bishop. However, Father Desgenettes' toughness of character made him dismiss the idea. The revolution of 1830 brought Father Desgenettes back to Switzerland, ostensibly under the pretext of healing his weakened health. In Freiburg, where he spent two years, the See (or bishopric) of Geneva and the French See of Moscow were offered to him but Father Desgenettes refused to accept them. Two years later, cholera broke out in Paris, and the archbishop claimed his services to treat the victims. Although ill, he did not hesitate a moment, and returned to his post at the Paris Foreign Missions Society, deploying, as in the past, an indefatigable zeal.
After having refused the Bishopric of Verdun and the Bishopric of Corsica, Dufriche-Desgenettes accepted the worst parish of Paris, the one where impiety and corruption were at their height: "the parish of the Petits-Pères" at the Basilica of Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Paris (Our Lady of Victories). During the first four years, all his efforts proved to be completely fruitless. He thought of giving his resignation, when he thought he heard one day, while celebrating Mass, a voice in his heart that told him to consecrate his parish to the Most Holy and Immaculate Heart of Mary. After struggling with this thought, which never left him, he believed it to be a divine inspiration and yielded by celebrating, on December 11, 1836, the Consecration of his parish to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.
From then on, the conversions began, and a remarkable change came over those in the parish neighborhood of Our Lady of Victories. On April 24, 1838, Pope Gregory XVI raised the small Brotherhood of Our Lady of Victories to the rank of a Universal Archconfraternity, the Archconfraternity of the Immaculate Heart of Mary. For twenty-three years, Dufriche-Desgenettes faithfully presided over his evening meetings, setting himself up in the pulpit, to make recommendations, to recount the graces obtained and to evangelize the people gathered at the foot of the altars. Father Desgenettes always exhibited patience, kindness and charity, mastering any mood swings that he suffered, but he also asked publicly for forgiveness twice a year. With the energy that characterized him, he had worked to overcome his quick and impetuous character, and he became one of the gentlest, most patient, most affable of men, and also one of the most humble of men. The praise he received afflicted him. When he was told about the high respect others had for him, Father Desgenettes showed his discontent by saying cheerfully: "My name! my reputation! it is the worldly-wise who court the world." His charity equaled his humility: he never met anyone in misery along his way, without helping them.
Consumed by excessive fatigue, his life suddenly began to decline rapidly. On November 4, 1839, he celebrated Mass for the last time, but he continued for some time, nevertheless, to hear confessions and complete all the duties of a pastor and priest, such that he was the subject of great edification to others by his prayerfulness and piety. He spent his last three weeks in his room, received the last sacraments on April 20, 1860, and died on the 25th of that month.
Dying, he bequeathed his papers to one of his priests, Father Defossés, who published them in four volumes containing 146 exhortations, instructions, and sermons.

Magnús góði Guðmundarson

Magnús góði Guðmundarson (or Guðmundsson; 1172 – 20 September 1240) was a medieval chieftain (gothi) of Þingvellir in Iceland. He was the "allsherjargoði" of the Althing (assembly of free men) from 1197 to 1234. He inherited the office from his father Guðmundr gríss Ámundason, who was the descendant of Ingólfur Arnarson, one of the first Viking settlers on the island. Magnús was the next-to-last allsherjargoði before the dissolution of the Icelandic Commonwealth in 1262. He had no offspring, and contemporary sources only offer conjectures about his successor, possibly Árni óreiða Magnússon, nephew of Guðmundr gríss Ámundason and son-in-law of the skald Snorri Sturluson. In fact, the sagas narrate that Sturluson caused Magnús's fall: during his first term as lawspeaker, Sturluson convinced the Althing to outlaw ("skógarmaðr") Magnús. Despite his title, Magnús was not one of Iceland's more powerful citizens.
According to " konungsannáll", Magnús obtained the support of the clans Haukdælir, Oddaverjar and Svínfellingar to become bishop of Skálholt in 1236, but he did not obtain the Apostolic Blessing since he did not fulfil the requirements for the position; his candidacy was approved neither by the Norwegian archdiocese nor the Pope.

Pialba Memorial Cenotaph

Pialba Memorial Cenotaph is a heritage-listed memorial at Freedom Park, Main Street, Pialba, Fraser Coast Region, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Philip Oliver Ellard Hawkes and built from 1918 to 1921 by Frederick William Webb. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 6 May 2016. It is also known as the Pialba War Memorial and the Hervey Bay War Memorial.
History.
The Pialba Memorial Cenotaph in Freedom Park, Pialba, in Hervey Bay, was unveiled on Sunday 17 July 1921, in honour of the men of the district who left to serve in World War I (WWI), and those who died. Originally sited near the eastern boundary of a railway reserve to the west of Main Street, in the late 1990s the marble pillar on its freestone plinth was moved about westwards to its current position, where it was mounted on a modern granite platform, set amongst the paths, grass and trees of Freedom Park. The Pialba Memorial Cenotaph is important in demonstrating Queensland's involvement in a major world event. As a focus for ANZAC Day ceremonies it is highly valued by the Hervey Bay community for its spiritual, symbolic, cultural and social associations.
Pialba is now a suburb of the city of Hervey Bay. European settlement at Hervey Bay began with the establishment of the pastoral run Dalgaroom () in the mid-1850s, and timber-getting commenced in the district in the mid-1860s. Dalgaroom run was reduced to and renamed Toogoom, which was later resumed and surveyed as farming portions from 1870. Farms in the Pialba area grew fruit, maize and potatoes, but they did not prosper until the railway line from Colton railway station (on the North Coast railway line) to Pialba opened on 18 December 1896. Other local industries have included sugar growing and dairy farming. In 1905 Pialba was referred to as "a township and favourite watering place [waterside resort area] for Maryborough", with a population of 292 (1901 census), within a district with a population of 5000. The railway, as well as transporting the produce of local farms, was utilised by seaside excursion trains and special picnic trains, generally run in conjunction with railway employee picnics, originating in Bundaberg, Gympie or Maryborough.
Like all Australian communities, Pialba was impacted by WWI, fought from 1914 to 1918. Of the 330,770 Australians who embarked for overseas service in WWI, 58,961 died and 170,909 were wounded, went missing or became prisoners of war. Even before the end of hostilities, memorials were being erected by Australian communities to honour local people who had served and died. These memorials were a spontaneous and highly visible expression of national grief; substitute graves for the Australians whose bodies lay in battlefield cemeteries in Europe and the Middle East.
Fund-raising for local war memorials was a voluntary community effort, as no State Governments, other than Victoria, made direct grants for local WWI memorials except for the building of halls, hospitals and schools, which were eligible for public money whether or not they were memorials.
WWI memorials took a variety of forms in Australia, including honour boards (from 1915), stone monuments (including obelisks, soldier statues, arches, crosses, columns or urns), tree-lined memorial avenues, memorial parks, and utilitarian structures such as gates, halls and clocks. In Queensland the digger statue was the most popular choice of monument, while the obelisk predominated in southern states.
The argument over whether a war memorial should simply be a monument, or have a utilitarian function, was had all over Australia. Post-WWI, most Australian localities decided on a monumental approach (60%), with only 22% choosing utilitarian buildings (mostly memorial halls) and 18% choosing the compromise position of utilitarian monuments (such as memorial clocks or drinking fountains). After World War II (WWII) the utilitarian form of memorial increased in popularity.
Pialba chose a monument for its war memorial, although some had preferred a memorial School of Arts building. In late 1918 Councillor W Whitaker and Albert Whitford, Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly, asked the Commissioner for Railways for a suitable site for a memorial "for fallen soldiers", and a site was granted in Station Square, an open area between the Pialba railway station building and Main Street, by August 1918. The location was apt, as many of the men would have departed via the railway station. The Pialba Farewell and Reception Committee (established c.1917) directed the movement, through a memorial committee. The memorial was to consist of a marble monument, with four panels (one on each face of the monument) listing the names of those who enlisted from the district and those who had died.
Pialba's war memorial took several years to realise. The monument's foundation stone, of freestone, was laid by Private Harry Aldridge on 14 December 1918. By this time over £200 had been raised for the memorial by locals, but the delayed arrival of the Italian white marble for the monument's pillar meant the finished memorial was not unveiled until 17 July 1921. During the course of the campaign to erect the monument, the committee responsible met in the local shire hall. The contractor for the monument was Frank William Webb of Maryborough, and the architect was POE Hawkes.
Hawkes, who also designed the Maryborough War Memorial, was born in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales in 1882. He worked as an architect in Wagga Wagga, Perth, Melbourne and Launceston before being employed in a temporary position by the Queensland Government in 1909. He subsequently worked in Maryborough, Bundaberg and Kingaroy, forming a partnership as Hawkes and Palmer in Kingaroy and Maryborough between 1914 and 1917. In 1919 he was employed by the Australian Government as District Adviser, registering as an architect (Qld) in 1930.
The monument's final design included octagonal curbing, and iron posts with wrought iron rails, and these were still extant in a 1950 photo of the monument, which also shows the Pialba Memorial Hall immediately to the north. The base of the marble pillar was inscribed with the words "This stone was erected by the citizens of Pialba and District in honour of the men who served and fell in the great war, 1914-1918", while the panel with the names of the fallen (on the same face of the monument) was headed "In memory of the men who paid the supreme sacrifice in the great war, 1914-1918". The other three panels listed the men "who served at the front". However, articles from August 1918 and July 1921 refer to listing those who had enlisted or volunteered. The names of future wars would later adorn the base of the four sides of the marble pillar: WWII, Korea, Malaya and Borneo, and Vietnam.
At the unveiling ceremony, it was noted that the district had sent 120 men overseas, and 18 had made the "supreme sacrifice"; although the monument currently lists 112 men, of whom 22 died. Mr Huxley Taylor, who had lost two sons at the front, performed the unveiling ceremony, and a German machine gun was also presented to Pialba as a war trophy.
In 1941 the former Pialba Shire Hall was moved to its current location near the cenotaph by the Pialba sub-branch of the RSSAILA for use as a memorial hall. It was located on land purchased from the Commissioner of Railways by the Burrum Shire Council. The hall, which had previously been used on ANZAC Days for gatherings and refreshments, was extended by the RSSAILA.
The use of the land around the cenotaph and memorial hall has changed over time. The last passenger service ran to Pialba station in 1972; the railway reserve was progressively subdivided from 1990; and train services were withdrawn from Pialba in January 1994. The station master's house faced the sea at the north end of the yard (now the northwest corner of Freedom Park) until its removal c.1999. By late 1998 the cenotaph had been moved west, as Railway Square was landscaped as part of Freedom Park, which in 2016 covered of the former railway reserve, including the former railway station building and the memorial hall. The railway station building was also moved westwards, and was rotated 180° to face the cenotaph, which was rededicated on 6 January 1999. A hollow metal world globe with laurel leaves at its base, designed and built by George Pujol, was added to the top of the marble pillar at this time.
A memorial plinth to National Servicemen was dedicated in 2003, north of the cenotaph, and a Light Horse statue and monument was added north of the station building, west of the memorial hall, in 2014 in time for the ANZAC Centenary in 2015. The cenotaph remains the focus of memorial ceremonies.
Description.
The Pialba Memorial Cenotaph stand within a area known as Freedom Park, on the corner of Main Street and Charles Street in the suburb of Pialba, in Hervey Bay. The site is bounded by residential properties to the west and commercial premises with parking facilities to the south. The open park setting contains level grassed areas, mature shade trees, and various modern landscaping features and memorial structures.
Only the cenotaph is considered to be of state heritage significance. The memorial hall is considered to be of local heritage significance.
Memorial Cenotaph.
The Pialba Memorial Cenotaph is located at the southern end of Freedom Park and is axially sited at the junction of modern concrete pathways from Main Street and Charles Street. The memorial consists of a decorative white marble pedestal on a light-brown freestone base, centred on a stepped, dark granite platform.
The squat stone base is square in plan, with rock-faced sides and a dressed top with bevelled edges. The pedestal has moulded, stepped sections and decorative leaded panels to each face, listing 22 men from the district who died (on the east panel) and 90 men who served (30 each on the north, west and south panels) in WWI. The decorative cornice features carved lilies and foliage, and is crowned by a plain carved aedicule with triangular pediments. A metal globe, consisting of a welded frame with the continents attached in sheet metal, has been inserted into the top of the aedicule.
Inscriptions to the bottom of  the pedestal commemorate major conflicts including the:
The east face of the shaft bears the inscription:"THIS STONE WAS ERECTED BY THE CITIZENS OF PIALBA &amp; DISTRICT IN HONOUR OF THE MEN WHO SERVED AND FELL IN THE GREAT WAR. 1914-1919."The modern granite platform, metal globe and stencilled concrete paths are not heritage-listed.
Landscape Features and Other Structures.
Mature trees, including figs (Ficus spp.), are located to the west and north of the cenotaph, and to the north of the hall. The relocated former Pialba railway station building is positioned to the west of the cenotaph. A recently dedicated Light Horse Memorial is situated to the west of the hall and various other modern memorial plaques are positioned throughout Freedom Park.

2018 Malacca state election

The 14th Malacca election was held on 9 May 2018 to elect the State Assemblymen of the 14th Malacca State Legislative Assembly, the legislature of the Malaysian state of Malacca. The Malacca State Legislative Assembly dissolved on 7 April 2018 by the Head of State (Yang di-Pertua Negeri of Malacca) on the advice of the Head of Government (Chief Minister of Malacca).
The election was conducted by the Malaysian Election Commission and utilised the first-past-the-post system. Electoral candidates were nominated on 28 April. On 9 May, between 8.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. Malaysian time (), polling was held in all 28 state constituencies throughout Malacca; each constituency elects a single State Assemblyman to the state legislature.

A Lazy Afternoon (Harold Land album)

A Lazy Afternoon is a studio album by American hard bop tenor saxophonist Harold Land. The album was recorded in Hollywood and released in 1995 via Postcards Records label.
Reception.
Scott Yanow of Allmusic wrote "Harold Land, a long underrated tenor giant based in Los Angeles, is quite melodic yet subtly explorative on his surprising disc. Backed by a string orchestra arranged and conducted by Ray Ellis and a rhythm section led by pianist Bill Henderson, Land explores dozen standards that are highlighted by "Nature Boy," "Invitation" and "You've Changed." He treats the melodies with respect and taste yet is not shy to stretch the music when called for. Harold Land plays beautifully throughout this memorable release."
Jim Macnie of "Billboard Magazine" noted "Harold Land glides through Ray Ellis' orchestral charts, rhapsodizing forlorn and alluding to noirish days gone by. His Lester Young part comes to the fore here."
Willard Jenkins of "JazzTimes" stated "Why didn't someone think of this before?... timeless pieces, beautifully rendered... if you are a seeker of beauty, Harold Land has the answer."

Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital

The Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital is a non-profit cancer-dedicated hospital near George Town in Penang, Malaysia. Located at the Tanjung Bungah suburb, the 40-bed hospital was founded in 1976 and offers specialist treatments for cancer patients, including tomotherapy, radiosurgery and chemotherapy.
History.
Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital was established by six Catholic nuns of the Franciscan Missionaries of the Divine Motherhood. The construction of the hospital began in 1974 and whilst waiting for the hospital's occupancy certificate, the nuns took the initiative to collect public donations for the project. The hospital was opened in 1976.
Initially, Mount Miriam Cancer Hospital focused on palliative care of late-stage cancer patients. In 1979, the then Chief Ministers of Penang, Lim Chong Eu, declared the opening of its Outpatient Complex and Radiotherapy Unit. Within the year, the hospital also obtained its first radiotherapy machine.
Further developments included the completion of a day chemotherapy unit in 1999 and a palliative outpatient clinic in 2001.
Services.
The hospital specialises in cancer treatments, including the following services.

St Catwg's Church, Gelligaer

St Catwg's Church, Gelligaer is a Listed place of worship in the community of Gelligaer in Caerphilly, South Wales.
History.
The site of a Roman fort, Gelligaer is believed to have been the site of St Catwg (or Cadoc)'s birth c. 500 AD. Cadoc's mother (according to most traditional accounts) was Gwladys, and Cadoc himself is recorded to have occupied a 'Capel Gwladys' in , the remains of which can still be seen. The date of the founding of the church itself is now unknown, but is reckoned to have occurred in 1266 (or whenever the Normans secured the overlordship of local rulers). Little is known of the early years of the church's life, as the records from this period are now lost. A document found in the records of Cardiff shows that Jasper Tudor, Duke of Bedford (the uncle of Henry VII of England), who occupied Cardiff Castle from 1488, donated a peel of bells and an organ to the church in recognition of the loyalty of Glamorgan to the Tudor cause. St Catwg's was one of eight churches in the area which received such gifts, together with Llandaff Cathedral, which received a tower. The organ and bells survived until the Commonwealth years.
During the Reformation, the church's valuables were plundered and its records were lost. Papism prevailed in Gelligaer until the early 17th Century. Several parishioners were summonsed in 1622 for refusing to attend Reformed services. The church's rector during the Commonwealth was ejected for refusing to accept a doctrinal change, and the church had no settled officiant for a decade after this. A parishioner named David Jones, who died in 1786, aged 92, was described as a 'professional papist'. Gelligaer was the richest living in the Diocese, though this led to incidences of clerical absenteeism, as the living was often granted to favoured candidates who had little interest in the welfare of their parishioners. The last case of this was one Thomas Stacy, who was rector of St Catwg's between 1827 and 1861, but spent almost all of this time at Llandaff, where he served concurrently as presenter. He was replaced by Canon Gilbert Harries, who took over the church in 1862, but by this time, the church was suffering from structural deterioration, which was in large part owed to the negligence of absentee clerics. In September 1866, the church's roof collapsed, and was restored by Charles Buckeridge in 1867-8. The interior plaster was removed in 1903. In 1931, a new vestry was added, and the former one converted into a lady chapel. St Catwg's became listed in 2001.
Daughter Churches.
St Catwg's was historically part of a very large parish which spread over much of North Eastern Glamorgan. Increasing industrialisation in the 19th Century and the corresponding rise in population led the parish to be segmented into smaller ones. St Catwg's later acquired two daughter churches (neither of which are listed) in the years following:
St Margaret's, Gilfach
was founded as a mission in 1895. The first church, built at the top of Margaret Street in 1903, was a small wooden structure, which was later replaced by a tin tabernacle at the present location on St Mary's Street. This was in turn transferred to the function of church hall after the, present St Margaret's was completed beside it and consecrated on 29 November 1933. The wooden church was later moved to the location also, though both it and the tin tabernacle have since been demolished.
St Anne's, Cefn Hengoed
was started in Cefn Hengoed in 1931, which was replaced by St Anne's church in 1939, which operated until the early 2010s.

2018 Penang state election

The 14th Penang election was held on 9 May 2018 to elect the State Assemblymen of the 14th Penang State Legislative Assembly, the legislature of the Malaysian state of Penang. The legislature had been dissolved on 9 April by the state's Governor, Abdul Rahman Abbas, on the advice of the then Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, who also led the state's ruling Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition.
The election was conducted by the Malaysian Election Commission and utilised the first-past-the-post system. Electoral candidates were nominated on 28 April. On 9 May, between 8.00 a.m. and 5.00 p.m. Malaysian time (), polling was held in all 40 state constituencies throughout Penang; each constituency elects a single State Assemblyman to the state legislature.
The PH coalition retained power with a stronger mandate, as it swept eight additional constituencies to hold 37 seats (out of 40) in the Penang State Legislative Assembly; the PH thus commands a supermajority in the legislature. Following the simultaneous Malaysian general election, which saw the PH forming Malaysia's federal government for the first time in the country's history, Chow Kon Yeow was selected as Penang's fifth Chief Minister, succeeding Lim who was appointed as the federal Minister of Finance.
Background.
The upcoming state election will be the 14th state election in the State of Penang since the independence of Malaya (now Malaysia) in 1957. The governing Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition sought to secure their third consecutive term in office since 2008.
According to the Constitution of the State of Penang, the maximum term of the Penang State Legislative Assembly, the legislature of Penang, is five years from the date of the first sitting of Assembly following a state election, after which it is dissolved by operation of law. The Assembly would have been automatically dissolved on 28 June 2018, the fifth anniversary of its first sitting on 28 June 2013.
However, the Chief Minister, as the head of government in Penang, may advise the Governor, the head of state, to dissolve the Assembly before the five-year period is up. Following the dissolution of the Malaysian Parliament by the then Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, on 7 April 2018, the Chief Minister of Penang at the time, Lim Guan Eng, was granted the consent of the Governor of Penang, Abdul Rahman Abbas, on 9 April to dissolve the Assembly.
A state election must be held within sixty days after the dissolution. Accordingly, the Malaysian Election Commission set 28 April as the nomination day and 9 May as the polling day. The timing of the election, which was to be held on a weekday as opposed to the usual practice of holding elections on weekends, sparked outrage on social media.
Political parties.
The Pakatan Harapan (PH), the ruling coalition in Penang, has been in power since 2008 and was led by the then Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng. In the aftermath of the 2013 state election, the PH controlled 29 out of the 40 seats in the Penang State Legislative Assembly.
The PH was challenged by two opposition coalitions, Barisan Nasional (BN) and Gagasan Sejahtera (GS), as well as a number of individual independent parties. The BN and GS coalitions were led by Teng Chang Yeow and Muhammad Fauzi Yusoff respectively.
Electoral divisions.
All 40 state constituencies within Penang, which constitute the Penang State Legislative Assembly, were contested during the election. The Malaysian Election Commission utilised the updated electoral roll as of the fourth quarter of 2017; voters who had registered by the end of 2017 were therefore eligible for polling. Penang had a total of 945,627 voters .
Electoral candidates.
By 27 April 2018, 471 nomination forms for Penang's state constituencies had been sold by the Malaysian Election Commission, making this election the most hotly contested election in Penang's history. A total of 155 candidates vied for the 40 state constituencies.
Campaign.
Analysts and news agencies, including "Channel NewsAsia", "The Straits Times" and "The Edge", predicted another victory for the Pakatan Harapan (PH) in Penang, due to the PH-led state government's achievements in social welfare and infrastructural developments, as well as Penang's economic growth under PH's tenure. Even so, the election was still hotly contested over several issues, including the vulnerability of the city-state to natural disasters such as floods and landslides, the proposed Penang Undersea Tunnel, transportation and public housing.
In particular, the PH administration placed considerable emphasis on Penang's achievements under its tenure, such as the state's solid economic performance, rapid development, overall cleanliness, public housing and the administration's social welfare policies. These were seen in contrast to the perceived discrimination of Penang by the Barisan Nasional-led federal government, especially in matters ranging from transportation to the lack of financial aid for Penang's flood victims.
Manifestos.
Barisan Nasional.
The Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition launched its Penang-specific manifesto on 15 April 2018 in Seberang Jaya. It pledged, among others, to create a special fund for first time married couples, ban construction projects at hill slopes and at areas above sea level, build low-cost houses (priced at RM40,000 each) in its Rent-To-Own Housing Schemes, and solve traffic congestion within the city-state. These were in addition to the previous promises made by various BN politicians, including the Malaysian Prime Minister and BN chairman, Najib Razak, to abolish toll charges for motorcycles on the Penang Bridge and to scrap the Penang Undersea Tunnel project, which had been proposed by Penang's Pakatan Harapan (PH) administration. BN politicians also claimed that the PH-led state government had failed to fulfil 51 promises and attempted to attract public attention on this issue by illegally pasting anti PH-posters throughout George Town on 20 March.
In response, the state government, led by the then Chief Minister Lim Guan Eng, slammed BN for deliberately copying the administration's policies into the BN manifesto, stating for the record that the government's policies, including social welfare programmes and reduced assessment rates for low-cost housing, have already been implemented. Notably, the BN manifesto failed to address the need for a rail-based public transportation system, such as LRT and monorail, within Penang; Lim maintained that the BN manifesto "offered no alternatives to building a public transport system to alleviate traffic congestion except to sabotage our proposed LRT and under-sea tunnel projects". Meanwhile, Jagdeep Singh Deo, the incumbent State Assemblyman for Datok Keramat, refuted BN's claims that Penang's PH-led state government had failed to provide affordable housing, reporting that more than 25,000 units of affordable housing have, in fact, been completed within the state. Critics also assert that the BN-led federal government has consistently discriminated the State of Penang by withholding major infrastructure projects and financial grants to the state.
Pakatan Harapan.
The Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition unveiled its Penang-specific manifesto on 25 April 2018 at the Penang Chinese Town Hall in George Town. The manifesto encompasses 68 pledges, including the implementation of the Penang Transport Master Plan which incorporates the proposed LRT and monorail services throughout the city-state, the construction of the Penang Undersea Tunnel, free-of-charge public bus services, a health-care programme which offers financial aid for lower-income households, a varsity township in Balik Pulau, the completion of more than 75,000 affordable housing units by 2025, a wider variety of public infrastructure, and a two-term limit for the position of the Chief Minister. In officiating the launch of the manifesto, PH leaders in Penang also promised financial funding for Islamic schools in the state and the promotion of interfaith harmony through the construction of a "'Harmony Centre"' for non-Muslim affairs.
Social media.
The election was notable for the extensive use of social media, particularly by the opposing Pakatan Harapan (PH) and Barisan Nasional (BN) coalitions. Both sides created numerous videos to disseminate their policies, pledges and ideologies to the public in the run-up to the election.
Videos created by the PH typically depict the improvements experienced by Penangites since 2008, when the coalition's predecessor, the Pakatan Rakyat (PR), was voted into power. The PH-led state government's welfare policies, Penang's economic growth, the refurbishment of existing infrastructure, and efforts to improve cleanliness and reduce crime, as well as the preservation of forest reserves within the state, are often touted in these videos.
In contrast, BN's videos generated considerable controversy. On 22 February 2018, a video entitled "Penang, would you hear my story?" depicting a woman grousing about her disappointment with the general state of affairs in Penang under PH rule was uploaded online by a BN-linked Facebook page. It received widespread condemnation by netizens and PH politicians alike, and was generally seen as a BN propaganda effort designed to peddle half-truths and myths about Penang's PH-led government. An official of the state government, Zaidi Ahmad, rebutted all the allegations raised in the video, pointing out, among others, that Penangites' median income and average monthly income were greater than the national average, Penang's relatively low unemployment rate and water tariffs, and that the PH administration has indeed built more affordable housing units within the state. Meanwhile, on 23 April, Grace Teoh Koon Gee, a councillor of the Penang Island City Council, lodged a police report over a BN-made video which painted the PH as a racist party. RSN Rayer, a DAP politician, slammed the video as extremely dangerous and stated that the video was intended to "instigate voters to go against PH".
During the campaigning period, a number of DAP candidates fell victim to slanderous social media content created by BN. For instance, Ramasamy Palanisamy, the Deputy Chief Minister II of Penang and the incumbent State Assemblyman for Perai, lodged a police report on 2 May over a manipulated video of his speech during a rally in Perai, which was reportedly circulated by BN. DAP's candidate in Seri Delima, Syerleena Abdul Rashid, also lodged a police report over BN's baseless allegations that she supported the Christian domination of Penang. BN cybertroopers targeted Satees Muniandy, the DAP candidate in Bagan Dalam, as well, claiming that he owns a luxurious house worth RM527,000.
Rallies.
Instead of holding large-scale rallies solely in Penang's capital city, George Town (on Penang Island), as was the practice in the 2008 and 2013 elections, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) organised simultaneous rallies in both George Town and mainland Seberang Perai. This change of tactic was intended to reach out to more voters, particularly in Seberang Perai, thus negating the need for supporters to travel across the Penang Strait to attend the rallies and reducing traffic congestion within George Town.
The first PH rallies were held concurrently on 28 April 2018 at George Town's Esplanade and Butterworth on the mainland; both rallies, which featured key speakers such as Lim Guan Eng, Nurul Izzah Anwar and Marina Mahathir, collectively attracted more than 120,000 people. Simultaneous PH rallies were also held on 2 May at George Town's Han Chiang College and Juru on the mainland, with the Han Chiang rally alone attended by a 120,000-strong crowd.
The last PH rallies were held at George Town's Esplanade on 7 and 8 May, the latter of which was held simultaneously with other PH rallies in Bayan Baru, Butterworth and Seberang Jaya. The PH rally at the Esplanade on 7 May collected RM84,335.70 worth of donations, with PH supporters staying on site despite the rain. Meanwhile, PH's last Esplanade rally on 8 May featured former United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) politician, Rafidah Aziz, as one of its key speakers, as well as the live telecast of a speech by Mahathir Mohamad, PH's candidate for the position of the Malaysian Prime Minister.
Controversies.
The decision by the Malaysian Election Commission to hold the election on a weekday (Wednesday, 9 May 2018), as opposed to the previous practice of holding elections on weekends, sparked considerable uproar on the Internet. Netizens voiced their displeasure and questioned the need to hold the polling day on a weekday, and alleged that this decision was intended to reduce voter turnout. In particular, voters residing outside Penang could be hampered from returning home for the polling day due to work commitments, thus carrying the potential of a lower voter turnout which would place the Pakatan Harapan (PH) at a disadvantage. In response to the nationwide criticism of the polling date, the then Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Razak, subsequently declared 9 May as a national holiday.
During the polling day on 9 May, PH candidates, including Lim Guan Eng and Zairil Khir Johari, reported that their mobile phones and social media accounts were being subjected to cyber attacks. The candidates alleged that their mobile phones received a continuous stream of automatically generated spam calls from United States-based phone numbers by the minute, disrupting the coalition's communications and operations in the midst of polling.
Election pendulum.
The 14th General Election witnessed 37 governmental seats and 3 non-governmental seats filled the Penang State Legislative Assembly. The government side has 25 safe seats and 2 fairly safe seats. However, none of the non-government side has safe and fairly safe seat.

The Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition scored its best ever electoral results in Penang's history, seizing eight additional seats to increase its tally in the Penang State Legislative Assembly to 37, or 92.5% of the legislature. The election marked the debut of PH's newest component parties - the Malaysian United Indigenous Party (Bersatu) and the National Trust Party (Amanah) - into Penang's political arena, with each of the parties winning two constituencies. The People's Justice Party (PKR) also successfully increased its share in the legislature from 10 seats to 14 seats. Meanwhile, the Democratic Action Party (DAP) saw an increase in the majority in some of its 19 seats. The incumbent Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng, defended the Air Putih constituency with over 80% of the popular vote, while Chow Kon Yeow won in Padang Kota with more than 70% of the popular vote. The largest margin of victory was recorded in Paya Terubong, where Yeoh Soon Hin of the DAP won by 31,189 votes.
The election also saw BN's worst performance in Penang's history, as the coalition lost seven constituencies to the PH and retained only two, both of which are won by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Once again, BN's other component parties, namely Parti Gerakan Rakyat Malaysia (Gerakan), the Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) and the Malaysian Indian Congress (MIC), did not win any seat. Although the Malaysian Islamic Party (PAS) lost the Permatang Pasir constituency, it managed to capture the Penaga constituency from the BN, thus giving the Islamist party a single seat in the Penang State Legislative Assembly.
Aftermath.
The 14th Malaysian general election, which was held simultaneously with the Penang state election, resulted in the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition seizing power at the federal level from the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN), making the election the first time since independence Malaysia experienced a regime change. On 12 May 2018, the incumbent Chief Minister of Penang, Lim Guan Eng, was appointed the Finance Minister by the new Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad. Chow Kon Yeow, the chairperson of the Democratic Action Party in Penang, had been endorsed by Lim to succeed the latter as the Chief Minister; Chow was sworn in as Penang's fifth Chief Minister on 14 May.
Meanwhile, Barisan Nasional's Penang chief, Teng Chang Yeow, announced his retirement from politics in the aftermath of the coalition's rout in the hands of the PH. Aside from the PH administration's exemplary performance in Penang in the preceding 10 years, the trouncing of the BN was also attributed to the Malaysia-wide tsunami against the perceived corruption and maladministration by the previous BN-led federal government. Teng's counterpart in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), Zainal Abidin Osman, also tendered his resignation as the Penang chief of the BN component party.

There are three bishops of this diocese known from antiquity,
 and three from the modern era.
The bishopric lasted until around the 690s when the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb caused it to effectively cease to operate. However in the 20th century the bishopric was revived in name at least. Today Vicus Aterii survives as a titular bishop's seat; the current titular bishop is Franz Vorrath, former auxiliary bishop of Essen.

Jigsaw (ransomware)

Jigsaw is a form of encrypting ransomware malware created in 2016. It was initially titled "BitcoinBlackmailer" but later came to be known as Jigsaw due to featuring an image of Billy the Puppet from the "Saw" film franchise. The malware encrypts computer files and gradually deletes them unless a ransom is paid to decrypt the files.
History.
Jigsaw was designed in April 2016 and released a week after creation. It was designed to be spread through malicious attachments in spam emails. Jigsaw is activated if a user downloads the malware programme which will encrypt all user files and master boot record. Following this, a popup featuring Billy the Puppet will appear with the ransom demand in the style of "Saw's" Jigsaw (one version including the "I want to play a game" line from the franchise) for Bitcoin in exchange for decrypting the files. If the ransom is not paid within one hour, one file will be deleted. Following this for each hour without a ransom payment, the amount of files deleted is exponentially increased each time from a few hundred to thousands of files until the computer is wiped after 72 hours. Any attempt to reboot the computer or terminate the process will result in 1,000 files being deleted. A further updated version also makes threats to dox the victim by revealing their personal information online.
Jigsaw activates purporting to be either Firefox or Dropbox in task manager. As the code for Jigsaw was written within the .NET Framework, it can be reverse engineered to remove the encryption without paying the ransom.
Reception.
"The Register" wrote that "Using horror movie images and references to cause distress in the victim is a new low." In 2017, it was listed among 60 versions of ransomware that utilised evasive tactics in its activation.

The Gleneagles Medical Centre is a 360-bed private hospital in the city of George Town in Penang, Malaysia. Founded in 1973 as the Penang Medical Centre, it was renamed after its acquisition by Parkway Pantai, a Singapore-based healthcare conglomerate. The hospital now consists of a 19-storey annexe, along with its original six-storey building.
History.
The Penang Medical Centre was established in 1973 and was originally a three-storey hospital with 70 beds. It was the brainchild of local, Penang-born tycoons, including Loh Boon Siew, who persuaded senior consultants from the Penang General Hospital to start a new private hospital.
The hospital was subsequently expanded to six floors in 1977. In 1989, Parkway Pantai, a Singapore-listed healthcare firm, acquired the majority control of the hospital, which was then renamed the Gleneagles Medical Centre. The hospital was expanded once again in 2013, with the completion of a 19-storey annexe.

<doc id="56637710" url="?curid=56637710" title="Engels' pause">
Engels' pause

Engels' pause is a term coined by economic historian Robert C. Allen to describe the period from 1790 to 1840, when British working-class wages stagnated and per-capita gross domestic product expanded rapidly during a technological upheaval. Allen named the period after German philosopher Friedrich Engels, who describes it in "The Condition of the Working Class in England". Economists have analyzed its causes and effects since the nineteenth century, with some questioning its existence. Twenty-first-century technological upheaval and wage stagnation have led economists and academics to draw parallels between the two periods.
Background.
The Industrial Revolution, which occurred between the mid-18th and mid-19th centuries, led to an increase in Britain's urban population and economic output due to the modernisation of manufacturing and technology. As per-capita gross domestic product grew, real wages of the British working class remained relatively constant. Capitalists and financiers of new, large-scale manufacturing businesses accumulated the gains from economic development, using them to expand their industries.
British academic economists Charles Harley and Nicholas Crafts analysed the growth rates of industries and economic sectors in Britain during the Industrial Revolution in 1980, estimating per-capita growth at 46 percent between 1780 and 1840. South African-British economic historian Charles Feinstein found in 1990 that working-class wages during that same period increased by 12%, a noticeably slower and comparatively-stagnant rate.
Friedrich Engels, in his 1845 "The Condition of the Working Class in England", highlighted the wealth disparity between the British industrialists and their workers. Robert C. Allen of New York University evaluated and substantiated Engels' account in his 2008 paper, "Explorations in Economic History", coining the term "Engels' pause".
In the years following Engels' pause and the publication of "The Condition of the Working Class in England", British wages began to rise with economic output. Between 1840 and 1900, output per worker increased by 90 percent and real wage growth increased by 123 percent. This pattern, in which labour productivity and wages increase at about the same rate, developed in Britain around the time that Engels wrote his book.
Causes.
Several explanations of Engels' pause exist, due to the dynamic nature of the British economy during the Industrial Revolution. During the revolution, classical economists provided theories explaining the wage stagnation. English scholar Thomas Robert Malthus proposed that technical progress would increase demand for labour, but this would be offset by an increase in population. German economist Karl Marx believed that technical progress, enhanced by a large amount of labour, would reduce demand for labour and prevent steady wage growth.
The first explanation of Engels' pause takes a macroeconomic approach, adopting the development model created by economist W. Arthur Lewis. The model shows a two-phase development process in an economic period, and divides the British economy into two sectors. In the agricultural sector, population exceeded capital output and the marginal product of labour was zero; the distribution of income from output amongst the population sustained livelihoods. Phase one shows the origins of Engels' pause, as surplus labour from the agricultural sector is absorbed into the modern sector to meet rapidly-increasing demand. The initially-more-prosperous segment is the technological sector, which encapsulates mass-manufacturing processes, new technology, and the rapidly-expanding urban population arising from the Industrial Revolution. The savings rate rose, as capitalists withheld part of their income and circulated the equity as investments to improve processes and develop technology. Capital accumulation ensured that the modern sector was continuously growing, and labour for the increasing capacity was infinitely available from the agricultural sector as the population moved from rural areas to the city (explaining the period's large-scale urbanisation. In this economic theory, the increase in the supply of labour meant a larger population among whom to divide wages. This kept wages stagnant as profits increased, leading to a snowball effect of capital accrual. The trend ends when the expanding sector absorbs the labour surplus; as it continues to grow, wages increase and Engels' pause ends.
The second approach looks at specific industries, including laws and occurrences in them which would have affected British wage growth. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Napoleonic Wars raised the prices of wheat and other agricultural products and hampered the growth of real wages. The Corn Laws, a series of tariffs on the import and export of grain which were designed to keep prices high, also ensured that wages remained stagnant. As the American grain invasion occurred in 1870 and the British and North American grain markets were integrated, the previous effects were mitigated and wages began to rise.
A third explanation, put forward by Carl Benedikt Frey, is that the early inventions of the Industrial Revolution were predominantly labor-replacing: "If technology replaces labor in existing tasks, wages and the share of national income accruing to labor may fall. If, in contrast, technological change is augmenting labor, it will make workers more productive in existing tasks or create entirely new labor-intensive activities, thereby increasing the demand for labor. The divergence between output and wages, in other words, is consistent with this being a period where technology was primarily replacing. Artisan workers in the domestic system were replaced by machines, often tended by children—who had very little bargaining power and often worked without wages. The growing capital share of income meant that the gains from technological progress were very unequally distributed: corporate profits were captured by industrialists, who reinvested them in factories and machines."
This pattern, Frey argues, becomes murkier over the course of the nineteenth century: "by the 1850s, the participation of children in the workforce had fallen dramatically. Quite possibly, the Factory Acts of the 1830s, which regulated working hours and improved the conditions of children in the factories, increased the cost of child labor and thus spurred the adoption of steam power, though causality might equally have run in the other direction. Regardless, the more widespread adoption of steam power from the 1830s onward, and the subsequent arrival of machines of greater size, meant that more-skilled operatives were required: the complementarity between factory equipment and the human capital necessary to operate it grew stronger as machines became more complex. Contemporaries like Peter Gaskell had already observed this tendency in the 1830s: Gaskell asserted that “since steam-weaving became so general as to supersede the hand-loom, the number of adults engaged in the mills have been progressively advancing; inasmuch that very young children are no longer competent to take charge of a steam-loom.”"
Effects.
Economic effects.
Before the Industrial Revolution, British industries were generally small-scale. Textile production relied on thousands of individual manufacturers, including spinners, weavers and dyers, who worked in their homes. Changes in steam technology revolutionised transport and manufacturing processes in Britain, allowing large-scale manufacturing and transportation and increasing industrial output. The construction of large factories allowed mass employment in one building, increasing labour efficiency and output.
Engels' pause allowed for the accrual of profits from output by capitalists and industrialists; these profits were returned to their industries to continue the expansion and development of new manufacturing processes and technology. Britain's gross domestic product increased steadily, with profits on business capital estimated at 12-16 percent during the 1850s. The share of income allotted to labour dropped from 50 percent in 1801 to 45 percent in 1845, with the rate of return to capital rising over 20 percent from the late 18th to the mid-19th century.
Social effects.
Working and living conditions during Engels' pause were poor, since the rate of urbanisation exceeded the rate of growth in labour demand. New processes and technologies in agriculture rendered traditional processes obsolete, and a surplus of cheap agricultural labour led to unemployment and increasing poverty in many rural areas (encouraging urbanisation). The increase in capital as a result of the Industrial Revolution led to increased demand for labour as a growing number of people moved to urban centres in search of employment. The large increase in urban population led to high unemployment; over 1.5 million people were unemployed in Great Britain during the early Industrial Revolution. Capitalists and industrialists accumulated and maintained wealth, and the working classes lived in overcrowded environments. The new urban population consisted of displaced agricultural workers, most of whom were unskilled; much of Parliament's attention was directed towards regulating and capitalising on technological developments and capital gain, and harsh treatment, long working hours and low wages were standard. Skilled labourers, such as weavers, found themselves redundant as new machinery usurped their roles. Women spent less time working in the family home, and took jobs in the domestic-service and textile industries. Children worked in factories to meet the demand for labour and contribute to family income.
Living conditions for a large part of the working class were poor due to rapid urbanisation. Overcrowding led to poor sanitation; low wages resulted in poor diets for those who could not afford fresh food, and diseases such as cholera, tuberculosis and typhoid became common.
Controversy.
Twentieth- and 21st-century economic historians studying the Industrial Revolution differ about whether wages remained stagnant or grew with gains from capital, questioning the existence of Engels' pause; comprehensive economic data from the period is difficult to find. According to Gregory Clark of the University of California, real wage growth in early-19th-century England was underestimated and GDP growth was overestimated; an inaccurate view of wage growth compared to GDP growth was presented, and wages grew more than per-capita output. Economic writer Tim Worstall questioned whether profit was accrued entirely by capitalists, or whether it was fed into worker income and not accurately recorded.
21st century.
The 19th-century Industrial Revolution was an all-encompassing societal transformation, from technology and culture to the economy. The changes caused by industrialisation required the principles of society to be redesigned. Engels' pause was accompanied by major changes in the social-security and party systems, elementary schools, urban planning, public transport and many other areas of society. It has been argued that a similar transformation is underway in industrialised Western nations, where digitisation and robotisation are transforming society. In the Western world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, the 2010s may be seen as the beginning of a similar "pause" in which the position of workers and the capacity of current systems to maintain the development of society are (at least temporarily) weakened.
Economists and businesspeople have associated the trends observed in Engels' pause with present-day conditions such as the role of technology and its continuous development, inequality in the global distribution of wealth and the changing nature of the workforce. According to the Demos Helsinki think tank, society and the economy is changing as it did during the Industrial Revolution. During industrialisation, productivity began to increase as society and business were designed in accordance with the new modes of operation; this eventually led to an unprecedented period of prosperity. Two social classes were born: the working class (whose living conditions were that which a large part of 20th-century politics revolved around improving) and the middle class, whose expansion was an important result of increased in prosperity triggered by industrialisation and political reform. The birth of political parties and urban planning can be dated to the beginning of industrialisation. Digitisation and robotisation may have begun a decades-long period of transformation comparable to the Industrial Revolution during which the basic structures of society and forms of livelihood may change and wealth may be radically redistributed.
Bank of England governor Mark Carney spoke at the April 2018 Public Policy Forum testimonial dinner in Toronto about his concern that rapidly-increasing technology in blue- and white-collar jobs would result in poor wage growth, worker redundancy and excessive capital accrual for owners of the machines. Economic reporter Cardiff Garcia presents a similar view, correlating the stagnation in real wage growth seen during Engels' pause to the present unequal distribution of wealth. Robert C. Allen has also reflected on similarities between 19th-century industrialisation and the present day. Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee have examined a similar phenomenon in their 2014 book, "The Second Machine Age". In "The Technology Trap", Carl Benedikt Frey argues that advanced economies are in a new Engels' pause, comparing the experience of the Industrial Revolution in England to the post-1980 Computer Revolution.

Roman Karl Scholz

Roman Karl Scholz (16 January 1912 – 10 May 1944) was an Austrian author and Augustinian canon regular at Klosterneuburg. He became a resistance activist after attending a Nuremberg Rally in 1936 and was executed fewer than eight years later.
Life and death.
The illegitimate son of a textile worker, Josefa Scholz, Karl Scholz was born in Mährisch Schönberg (as it was known at that time), a prosperous manufacturing town in the northern part of Moravia in the Austrio-Hungarian empire. When he was six the empire was broken up and his home town was transferred to the new republic of Czechoslovakia. It remained overwhelmingly German in terms of language and ethnicity, but in a period of heightened nationalism the growth of the Czech speaking minority became a source of tension, and it was part of the regions which politicians were beginning to identify as the Sudetenland. Roman Karl Scholz grew up with his grandparents. He attended the Gymnasium (secondary school) in his home town. As a school boy he joined a local Catholic youth group, becoming a group leader. Sources relate that he wrote poems, loved nature and took an interest in politics. He also "fell under the spell" of those advocating nationalist solutions to the Sudeten-German issue, which increasingly became identified with the idea that the Sudetenland should be detached from Czechoslovakia and attached to Germany in deference to the principle of Self-determination, which had been proclaimed as a guiding principal for reconfiguring the political map by the victorious governments in 1918/19. Then, in 1930, he entered Klosterneuburg Monastery (a short distance to the north of Vienna as a novice canon regular ("Augustiner-Chorherr"), taking the "religious" additional name, "Roman". He successfully completed his probationary period and was ordained into the priesthood in 1936. Between 1936 and 1938 he was employed as a chaplain in the Heiligenstadt district of north Vienna. In 1938 he started working as a teacher of religion at the Gymnasium in Klosterneuburg, and from 1939 he was teaching Christian Philosophy at the monastery's own school, also employed as priest for the military centre in the little town after war broke out at the end of the summer.
As a young man, like many who had grown up with the Christian Youth movement in Sudetenland, he was drawn to Nazism, even attending a party rally at Nuremberg in the summer of 1936. The experience proved a turning point, however, unmasking for him the ugly underpinnings of Nazi ideology. In March 1938 Austria was invaded by the German army and quickly became incorporated into an enlarged Nazi German state. That year Roman Karl Scholz teamed up with his friend Dr. Viktor Reimann to create the "German Freedom Movement" ("Deutsche Freiheitsbewegung") a resistance group of an essentially Catholic and conservative character. After war broke out, in September 1939, the group was renamed, becoming the "Austrian Freedom Movement" ("Österreichische Freiheitsbewegung"). Their political objectives were to start by educating people about the true nature of National Socialism, and then to accomplish the downfall of the Nazi regime. This should be accompanied by the extraction of the Danube and Alpine provinces from the recently enlarged German state, and the re-establishment of an independent Austrian state which would also incorporate Bavaria, thereby extending in a northerly direction all the way to the River Main. Some of the recruits were drawn from among the older school students whom Scholz taught. In the end, there were around 300-400 members. The movement also incorporated a women's group, organized around Luise Kanitz. They collaborated with the resistance group centered on that led by . There were contacts with the western allies and with Czechoslovak resistance groups.
Each member of the group took an oath of allegiance. Those who swore allegiance presumably included Otto Hartmann, an actor from the Vienna Burgtheater. He was introduced to the group by his fellow thespian, Fritz Lehmann. Neither Scholz nor Lehmann knew that Hartmann was a Gestapo spy. It was Hartmann who suggested that the group should embark on a programme of terror and sabotage. Scholz rejected the idea which would have run counter to his Christian principles. It remains not entirely certain whether Hartmann was already on the Gestapo payroll at this point, but in any case, in June 1940 he reported directly to the Gestapo everything that the resistance movement had been discussing and planning.
Scholz was arrested at the monastery, with four others, on 22 July 1940. He was held pending trial for more than three years. He was repeatedly interrogated during this period, and transferred from one prison to the next both in Vienna and further afield, but without betraying accomplices. An intervention by a sister of Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, with whom a friend of Scholz had a connection, proved fruitless. He faced the special people's court in Vienna in February 1943. The indictment stated that he had brought about "the bringing together of people inclined to [political] opposition and drawn them into an organisation hostile to the state, for the purpose of splitting the Greater German realm" ("den Zusammenschluß von oppositionell eingestellten Personen herbeizuführen und in staatsfeindlichen Organisationen mit dem Ziel einer Zersplitterung des Großdeutschen Reiches zu sammeln"). A public defender was assigned to his case, and rather half-heartedly entered an "extenuating circumstances" plea, on the grounds that the accused was clearly a fantasist, as his poems demonstrated, meaning that there was no question of "guilt" as strictly defined. Roman Karl Scholz was condemned to death on 23 February 1943. Cardinal Archbishop Innitzer of Vienna submitted a personal plea for clemency by telegramme to Adolf Hitler, who failed to reply. Scholz himself had been convinced that he would be condemned to death from the moment of his arrest, and he was right.
Roman Scholz was one of approximately twenty resistance activists executed by guillotine on the scaffold at the district courthouse in Vienna on 10 May 1944. His final words were "Für Christus und Österreich!" ("For Christ and Austria!"').

Lauriston Elgie Shaw

Lauriston Elgie Shaw FRCP (31 March 1859 – 25 December 1923) was an English physician and dean of the Guy's Hospital medical school from 1893 to 1901. He had an active part in framing the terms of the National Insurance Act 1911, which put him at odds with many of his colleagues who were strongly opposed to the legislation.
Early life and family.
Lauriston Elgie Shaw was born in London on 31 March 1859, the son of Archibald Shaw a medical practitioner of St. Leonards. He was educated at the City of London School and then University College, London. He studied medicine at Guy's Hospital and qualified in 1881.
Shaw married May, daughter of Howard Spalding. They had one son.
Career.
Shaw progressed through the normal appointments at Guy's during his early career, breaking only for a sea trip to Australia for his health during which he served as the ship's surgeon. Early on, he held the appointment of assistant physician to the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest. In 1889, he was appointed assistant physician and demonstrator of morbid anatomy at Guy's. He was dean of the Guy's Hospital medical school from 1893 to 1901 and succeeded by his great friend John Fawcett. He was made full physician in 1907 and consulting physician in 1919.
He played an active part in the framing the terms of the National Insurance Act 1911 which put him at odds with many of his colleagues who were strongly opposed to it. His position created such antipathy to him that he felt that many avenues in the medical world were closed to him.
In 1915 or 1916, he became manager of the Metropolitan Asylums Board and was chair of Pinewood Santorium sub-committee.
Death and legacy.
Shaw died from the effects of pulmonary tuberculosis, a disease he had suffered from for 40 years, at Weybridge, Surrey, on 25 December 1923. He received an obituary in the "British Medical Journal" and is recorded in Munk's Roll.

2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade

The 2018 Moscow Victory Day Parade was a military parade that took place in Red Square in Moscow on 9 May 2018 to commemorate the 73rd anniversary of the capitulation of Nazi Germany in 1945. The annual parade marks the Allied victory in World War II on the Eastern Front, on the same day as the signing of the German act of capitulation to the Allies in Berlin, at midnight of 9 May 1945 (Russian time). President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin delivered his fifteenth holiday address to the nation after the parade inspection presided over by Minister of Defense General of the Army Sergey Shoygu.
Significance and events.
This year's parade also marked the centennial year since the 1918 foundation of the Red Army. This year for the first time, in the Victory Day parade in Moscow, it was planned that armored vehicles from the Red Army during the Russian Civil War would be to take part in the parade mobile column, the planned appearance was called off, and the 154th Preobrazhensky Independent Commandant's Regiment's 1st Honor Guard Company took part in the exhibition drill segment of the parade together with a drumline from the Moscow Military Music College, the first time it had been done since the parade of 2007 and a recent tradition which began in the 2001 parade.
Originally, for the first time since 2002, cadets from the Civil Defense Academy of the Ministry of Emergency Situations were not to take part in the Victory Day parade in Moscow, while EMERCOM detachments continued to march past in other major parades nationwide, however, the decision was rescinded. New military vehicles in the parade include the BMPT Terminator A pair of Russia's 5th-generation Su-57 fighter jets flew for the first time over Red Square, together with two MiG-31s armed with Kinzhal air-to-surface missiles.
For the third consecutive year, the parade included a composite ceremonial female battalion from the Military University of the Ministry of Defense, the Military Academy of Material and Technical Support, and the Military Space Academy. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić were both present during the parade as the main foreign guests.
Preparatory activities.
Beginning in December 2017, preparations for the parade were well attended at the unit level. Individual unit practices were held in the various military installations for all the participating units in the national and local parades. Unit practices within Moscow Oblast itself started in early March in the Alabino field and other locations before the full-blown parade practice run-throughs for all the participating units will commence later in the month.
All parade practice runs began on 24 March 2018 in the Alabino training range with the first practice run through for the ground column, kicking off the 2-month long national preparations for the 73rd Victory Day, and will last even until the middle of April when the runs on Red Square for the national parade itself will start, ending with a final general combined practice run of the parade in early May in the morning. From the 1st week up to the 3rd week of April, the Alabino military training center serves as the parade training ground for the estimated 14,000 military personnel in attendance for the Moscow parade, plus more than 135 vehicles and 78 aircraft. The air flypast column began their training flights on 9 April 2018.
